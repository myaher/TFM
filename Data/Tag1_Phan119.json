The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a></p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>For a moment, no words will come. The blood in Dan\u2019s wrist pulses in odd, shifting patterns beneath the skin. He swallows, caught on the edge of a gelid blue stare. \u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u00a0<i>ski</i>?\u201d Phil asks, his sneer an anchor that yanks Dan back down from the astral plane into which Phil\u2019s touch had propelled him.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u00a0<i>can</i>\u00a0ski,\u201d he retorts, bristling. He chooses not to mention that he hasn\u2019t skied since he was fourteen, when his family went to Chamonix for a week, and his mum and dad complained the entire time that it was too cold. At a\u00a0<i>ski lodge</i>. \u201cBut I have to\u2026 y\u2019know, work. Hotel stuff.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Mesmerised by the slight twitch of the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth, which still doesn\u2019t quite count as a smile, Dan\u2019s hostile stance falters, then wanes. Like it\u2019s a perfume wafting from Phil\u2019s skin through the air between them, in the next second Dan smells the imminence of his own surrender.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Phil says, his voice quiet, like it\u2019s just for Dan. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that nobody else could have heard him anyway. \u201cWhat else are you gonna do all day? Cook lunch for the hotel ghosts? Sit at reception and pretend you\u2019re not playing on your phone?\u201d</p><p>A spurt of blood shoots into Dan\u2019s cheeks; he\u2019d thought he was so stealthy, hiding his phone under the desk as he attempted to load a single meme at a time on Tumblr mobile, using tenuous 3G.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t have any skis,\u201d Dan says lamely.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you that my old ones were repaired by the elusive hotel elf, then,\u201d Phil quips, already stepping away. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you by the front door, shall I?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s gone before Dan can muster up a further refusal. He stands gormless in the middle of the kitchen, gazing around at the pristine surfaces. If only he\u2019d resisted the urge to clean everything already, then he could at least have the excuse of needing to scrub the day away. Perhaps he could quickly throw open all the cupboard doors, ransack the fridge and hurl ingredients and coffee everywhere, feigning a wolf had snuck in somehow, or a snow leopard.\u00a0</p><p>An image flashes into Dan\u2019s mind, of Mona\u2019s deepening frown as Phil explained to her that not only did Dan let some wild animal break in and contaminate the kitchen, but that he also refused to grant the one request of the only guest. He shudders, closing the door on that image before it can develop. Mona is already far too close to a stark realisation of Dan\u2019s utter hopelessness; despite the words of any fortune-telling crows, a voice lingers at the back of Dan\u2019s mind, assuring him that it\u2019s only a matter of time before he slips up and disappoints everyone. His only hope is to stall that inevitability for as long as possible.\u00a0</p><p>Plus Phil is, annoyingly, right. There is nothing else for Dan to do today; he and Mona did a deep clean of the whole hotel before she left, and the place is spotless. With no guests to look after, and a low chance of anyone phoning given that the Swiss news helpfully predicted a terrifying blizzard, Dan really is at a loose end.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>It takes about two minutes of dithering in the kitchen before he has to admit defeat. Dan lets out a dreaded sigh, pushing all the air from his lungs, and then goes to wash up the two mugs he\u2019s still holding. As he\u2019s scrubbing the coffee stains, he decides that caffeine is the only acceptable (or available) drug he can utilise to get through whatever lies in store, so he places the mugs on the drying rack, and rinses out a thermos flask he finds, along with Louise\u2019s percolator. He makes the coffee very strong, pours it into the flask, then thinks for a moment, and adds a dollop of soya milk.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as he opens his chest of drawers, Dan is struck once again by how ill-prepared he is for a sudden, impulsive foray into the snowy wilderness. As he lacks proper \u2018ski-wear\u2019 - whatever that might be - Dan Instead chooses to go for layers. A clingy t-shirt that barely fit him when he was sixteen, then a baggier, long-sleeved t-shirt. He covers these with a shapeless grey jumper, then a black jacket, and then, finally his warmest coat. He adds thick socks, a hat, boots, sunglasses, gloves and a scarf. By the time he feels he\u2019s ready, his arms stick out stiffly from his sides, but he figures that a little loss of movement is a fair price to pay for not getting frostbite.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He slots the flask into one of the deep pockets of his coat, and tries not to think too hard about what he\u2019s about to do. Or with whom. He deliberately takes his time getting down to the lobby in order to prolong the inevitable, and also because he likes the idea of the Fresh Prince of the Alps having to wait for him. Phil\u00a0lowers his phone as Dan approaches, pushing off from where he\u2019s leant against the wall. It takes a moment for him to drink in the sight of Dan, and then his eyebrows shoot up, and he seems to swallow something suspiciously close to a laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cErr, think you\u2019ll be warm enough?\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly pack for extreme sports.\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil just makes a \u2018hmm\u2019 noise, turning to the collection of skis and poles leaning against the wall. \u201cNot sure cross-country skiing could be classed as an extreme sport, but you do y- er, suit yourself.\u201d<br/></p><p>If Dan tries to reply, he\u2019ll probably swear, so he clamps his mouth shut, and sticks an arm out to grab for the the red skis. Phil snatches them up first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear these,\u201d he says. \u201cYou take the new ones.\u201d<br/></p><p>He doesn\u2019t look at Dan, just pushes the shiny new skis into his hands. Bewildered, Dan stares at his warped reflection in the electric blue varnish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d<br/></p><p>It takes a minute for Phil to respond; he\u2019s tugging at the repaired bracket on the red ski, seemingly to test its durability. This alone is enough to make Dan want to slap it out of his hands. Then, he turns to Dan, that vague almost-smile still tucked beneath his smug expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t tested the new ones out yet,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cReckon it\u2019d be better for my caddy to fall on his face than me, right?\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan splutters, outraged. \u201c<i>Caddy?</i>\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGrab those ski poles for us, would you?\u201d Phil asks, a spritz of amusement perfuming his words.\u00a0</p><p>Dan might be intrigued by the lightness of his tone if it weren\u2019t for the fact he were quietly steaming inside his many layers. The heating in this place does not fuck about. Worried he\u2019ll boil alive unless they get outside soon, Dan chooses to just do as he\u2019s asked. If Phil insists on calling him a caddy again, at least Dan will have four long weapons to wield.\u00a0Dan gathers the four poles up in his arms as best he can, along with his own skis; on the verge of dropping everything, he opts for speed, and scurries after Phil out of the front door.</p><p>\u201cIf you expect me to haul all of this up some peak or other-\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan can\u2019t see, as he\u2019s got a number of pointed objects obscuring his view, so he doesn\u2019t realise that Phil has stopped directly in front of him, a few paces beyond the door. Dan bumps straight into him, and instantly everything he\u2019s holding drops to the ground. When he looks up, Phil is aiming an exasperated gaze down at the pile of poles and skis, as if he\u2019s already regretting inviting Dan along.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t expect you to actually be my pack mule. We\u2019re going to\u00a0<i>wear</i>\u00a0our skis,\u201d Phil explains slowly, like he\u2019s talking to a child.<br/></p><p>He\u2019s already got his skis laid neatly out in front of him - two bright red parallel lines striking through the snow. As Dan watches confusedly, Phil pushes the tip of his right boot into one of the skis. Dan\u2019s stomach squeezes with discomfort; he\u2019d been correct before, when repairing the skis. The fastenings are not the same as he\u2019s used to.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cErm,\u201d Dan says, moving his attention to one of his own skis, laying at an angle in the snow. It has the same unfamiliar fastening, much to his dismay.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Mind racing to figure out every option available to him that doesn\u2019t involve swallowing his pride and asking Phil for help, Dan moves to inspect the contraption. As if he\u2019s sensed Dan\u2019s incompetence, Phil drops into a crouch anyway, and reaches for Dan\u2019s boot. Instinctively, Dan jerks his foot away. Phil lifts his head to look at Dan. Viewing him from this angle is strange. From this perspective, he seems hunched, small, insignificant. He has none of his Lordly airs about him, hunched down in the snow near Dan\u2019s feet. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything, he just waits, hand calmly outstretched towards Dan\u2019s boot.\u00a0Wordlessly, Dan moves his foot back into Phil\u2019s reach, and watches as Phil carefully rights the ski, then pulls his foot towards it. He fits the toe of Dan\u2019s boot into the unusual strap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re telemark skis,\u201d Phil says, tightening the strap around the ball of Dan\u2019s foot. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re more used to Alpine skis? They\u2019re the ones with the strap at the back as well.\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan bristles again at the condescending tone. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with both,\u201d he says, because he\u2019s a stubborn moron. Phil says nothing, but that near-smile returns as he reaches for Dan\u2019s other foot; Dan wobbles slightly as Phil guides it into the left ski. \u201cBut, uh, it\u2019s been a while. So&hellip; remind me again of the difference between, er, telemark and\u2026\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAlpine,\u201d Phil supplies, standing up. He holds Dan\u2019s gaze for a moment, and then laughs, short and quiet, but just enough for Dan to catch a glimpse of two rows of pearl-white teeth, with a flash of pink tongue caught between them. It\u2019s the most Dan\u2019s seen him smile yet, though he\u2019s obviously laughing\u00a0<i>at</i>\u00a0Dan which isn\u2019t ideal. \u201cTelemark skis are designed so that you can wear them for both hiking and skiing. You can move your ankle in them, see?\u201d<br/></p><p>He demonstrates, twisting his un-strapped heel to and fro. Dan tries to do the same, and almost falls over. \u201cWhy do we need to use our ankles, exactly?\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t remember skiing requiring a lot of joint movement. From what he can recall of his brief experience as a teenager, he strapped the skis on, let the lift drag him up a big hill, and gravity did a lot of the work getting him to the bottom again.<br/></p><p>Phil is full-on smirking now. Dan thinks he preferred the non-smile. \u201cYou may have noticed that we don\u2019t have chairlifts up here. We\u2019ll be hiking to the slopes on foot. I\u2019ve put skins on the bottom of these to give us more grip, but we can take them off when we get there.\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan tries not let the alarm show on his face. They\u2019re going to be walking up hills? In skis? \u201cAnd&hellip; I suppose once we ski down the slope we\u2019ll be having to&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWalk back up again? Yes. Unless you fancy setting up camp down there.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>An ill-timed image of the Brokeback Mountain tent attacks Dan so viciously it nearly knocks him sideways.\u00a0\u201cNo! No, no. Walking back up. Cool. Good thing I\u2019ve been practicing with those bloody hotel stairs, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan forces a laugh, but this time Phil\u2019s face remains unmoved. Clearly it\u2019s only Dan\u2019s unintentional idiocy that can procure a genuine smile from him then, right.\u00a0</p><p>Phil looks to the sky briefly, seeming to assess something in the heavens themselves, and asks, \u201cready to go, then?\u201d<br/></p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for Dan\u2019s reply. He picks up his ski poles, then turns and begins sort of slide-walking away from the hotel, in seemingly no particular direction. There\u2019s a large thicket of trees ahead of him, but then there are thickets of trees in a few other directions too. Nevertheless, Dan has no choice but to trust this man\u2019s sense of direction, so attempts to move after him; to his horror, his legs immediately split apart in a move he is certainly not flexible enough to achieve. He manages to stab his ski poles into the earth and rectify himself before pulling anything, but in doing so he flails, and almost falls. Luckily, he\u2019s gotten back into a reasonably dignified standing position by the time Phil turns to him, wondering what the hold up is.<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan says, making a valiant attempt to copy Phil\u2019s movements exactly as he inches forwards again. It works, sort of, though he doesn\u2019t do it anywhere near as gracefully as Phil seems to be able to. When he gets to Phil, he shrugs, like he\u2019s totally fine. \u201cJust\u2026 admiring the view,\u201d he explains. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It takes over thirty gruelling minutes to cross the plains of the mountain in pursuit of a supposedly safe ski-area, but eventually they reach an abrupt dip, where the mountain begins its gradual slope downward. This close to the edge of the mountain, the view is breathtaking. Dan can\u2019t focus on it, however, because his thighs ache, the moisture in his lungs has turned to ice and is freezing him from the inside out, and for the last twenty minutes, Phil Novokoric has been unhelpfully telling him everything he\u2019s doing wrong with the stupid\u00a0\u2018telemark\u2019 skis.<br/></p><p>\u201cIs this where we do some actual skiing then?\u201d Dan asks crossly, jamming his poles into the snow.<br/></p><p>He\u2019s so glad to get to a point where he actually knows what he\u2019s doing that he\u2019s already shuffling up to the edge of the slope, more than ready to get this over with. He\u2019s so keen, in fact, that he\u2019s only just about saved from teetering over the edge and hurtling down in an enormous cartoon-style snowball, by a far more sensible Phil. He grabs Dan by the hood of his coat before he can topple to his untimely death.<br/></p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d he exclaims as he yanks Dan backwards. Yet again, the irritating warning is at least ten seconds too late. Dan has already been an idiot; unless Phil expects him to travel back in time to ten seconds ago, and take heed of Phil\u2019s caution. Phil pulls him so sharply that Dan jolts backwards, skis slotting between Phil\u2019s as his back crashes against his chest. His heart pounds incessantly. Or maybe that\u2019s Phil\u2019s heart. \u201cAre you some kind of moron?\u201d Phil asks, then pauses, like he\u2019s actually waiting for an answer. \u201cJust\u00a0<i>wait\u00a0</i>a minute, we\u2019ve got to take our skins off. Then\u00a0<i>I\u2019ll</i>\u00a0lead the way.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRemind me why I agreed to this,\u201d Dan mutters, carefully sliding away from Phil whilst trying not to accidentally fall down the slope.\u00a0</p><p>Sulkily, he stands to the side and watches as Phil removes one ski, and peels a thin black strip from the underside, then does the same to the other. Dan copies his action in silence, though he has no idea why on earth this is necessary. Phil monitors Dan wordlessly, but thankfully makes no judgemental comments.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks once Dan has his de-skinned skis back on.\u00a0</p><p>Dan shoves the bunched up skins into his jacket pocket.\u00a0<i>No</i>. \u201cYep.\u201d<br/></p><p>And then, with enviable ease, Phil pushes himself over the edge of the slope, and begins drifting downwards, swaying gracefully to and fro as he descends. Somewhat alarmed by how quickly that just happened, Dan swallows his nerves and shoots after him. It\u2019s\u00a0<i>terrifying</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Dan hasn\u2019t experienced this level of self-propelled velocity for years, let alone the searing chill that whips his cheeks, or the sensation of being at once in control of his own speed, and simultaneously ill-equipped to do so. He grips his ski poles tightly, attempting to copy Phil\u2019s swooping motions up ahead, leaning left and right as much as he dares in order to slow his pace. The slope had not looked particularly steep from the top, but Dan should probably have been more concerned about the amount of debris on the path that he has to keep swerving to avoid. Annoyingly, Phil was completely right in insisting he went first, as otherwise Dan would have crashed several times into boulders and tree stumps and icy patches.<br/></p><p>It can\u2019t last particularly long, but it seems to Dan that he\u2019s skiing, teeth gritted, eyes frozen open, for hours. Eventually however, the slope evens out, and flattens enough that they slow to a stop. Somewhere in the recesses of Dan\u2019s brain, he scrounges up his knowledge of how to point the tips of his skis together to halt himself. Phil does some kind of impressive, sudden, 90 degree turning move, but he doesn\u2019t outright laugh at Dan\u2019s less stylish method, thankfully.</p><p>Dan is just about to collapse to the floor and weep, relieved he survived that and didn\u2019t so much as fall over once, when Phil pulls off his sunglasses, and gives Dan the widest, most brilliant grin. His teeth are as white as the snow surrounding them. Seeing such animation on his usually sullen features is so unexpected that Dan swears his heart literally skips a beat, though that might be on account of all the adrenaline from plummeting down the side of a mountain. Dan removes his own sunglasses, somewhat shakily, and aims a tentative smile back at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Phil says, eyes bright and crystalline in the light. \u201cIf you did some fitness training, you might be halfway decent.\u201d<br/></p><p>The smile wipes itself away again. \u201cThanks,\u201d Dan mutters.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d Phil asks, elbow resting on one of his upright ski poles. He\u2019s a tiny bit breathless, which gives his words a whisperish quality. In another setting that wasn\u2019t as eerily silent, it might be difficult to hear him. \u201cFun, right?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that,\u201d Dan replies, heart still pounding at double his normal rate.<br/></p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cThis is probably the gentlest path I\u2019ve found.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFound?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t be certain of course, but I doubt anyone else has ever skied up here.\u201d He grins again, jarring and hypnotic. \u201cI\u2019m the Columbus of the Alps.\u201d<br/></p><p>This seems highly unlikely. Dan\u2019s no expert in mountaineering, but surely other adventurers have come up and explored the mountain before now. Phil being the first one to ever scope out reasonably skiable pathways seems incredibly dangerous, and probably illegal.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you, like, allowed?\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil shrugs, slipping his shades back on. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna stop me?\u201d<br/></p><p>It\u2019s this offhanded, entitled flippancy that Dan detests about the rich. He chooses not to respond to such an irritating question, and instead asks, \u201cso, what now?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cClimb back up,\u201d Phil says, already pulling his skins from his pocket. \u201cUnless you wanna check out one of the trickier slopes?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Dan says tightly.<br/></p><p>Phil chuckles again. \u201cAlright then, skins on, Howell.\u201d<br/></p><p>*<br/></p><p>In hindsight, Dan should really have given more thought to the idea of climbing back up the hill they\u2019d just skied down, in skis. To say it was difficult would have been generous. By the time they reach the top (it shouldn\u2019t go unmentioned that Phil was much, much quicker than Dan at getting back up, and then shouted helpful suggestions of how he should turn his heels, or dig his skis in to the snow from the summit) Dan is so exhausted he never wants to lift another limb in his life, let alone slide down a hill just to climb it yet again. Phil is raring to go, of course, but Dan simply unfastens his skis and falls back onto his bum, unconcerned that the snow immediately begins seeping into the seat of his trousers, and gestures for the other man to go on without him.<br/></p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Phil says, snickering, and pushes over the edge.<br/></p><p>From his position, Dan is able to watch as Phil airily glides down. It\u2019s obvious, from this vantage point, that skiing gives Phil an air of freedom that he lacks in everyday life. His limbs are loosened of their usual tension, and even from a distance Dan can see that he is calm and happy. As Phil re-climbs the slope, Dan peels off the weird skins from the underside of his skis again and studies them for a bit, then stuffs them into his pocket, deciding they\u2019re just flaps of fabric you could make in five seconds, probably sold in sports shops at an absurd cost. He then attempts to browse the internet on his phone, though given that they\u2019re currently in the middle of absolutely nowhere, this does not go well. He quickly abandons any attempt to check his Facebook feed, and plays Crossy Road until a shadow washes over him. He looks up just as Phil slumps down beside him, panting.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence on me,\u201d Phil says between breaths. \u201cUsually I do this about twenty times, up and down. On the steeper slopes, too.\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cExcuse me, but screw that. Nobody told me there\u2019d be climbing involved. Give me a terrifying ski lift any day.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnywhere there\u2019s a ski lift there\u2019s a hundred tourists crammed on, waiting to dawdle in front of you on the slope on the way down.\u201d<br/></p><p>Again, Dan doesn\u2019t remember this being particularly true from his previous skiing experience. On the red and black runs, there were only a handful of other people to avoid. He can see nothing wrong with something being made safe by professionals. Deciding it\u2019s probably wise to keep this thought to himself in order to keep the peace, Dan instead digs the flask of coffee out of his pocket, pulls both the plastic cups off the top, and hands one to Phil.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve skied in a lot of places, then?\u201d he asks.<br/></p><p>Phil is looking down at the cup like Dan just pulled it out of his rear end. \u201cEr\u2026 yeah. Quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Dan ignores the curious expression being aimed at him, and just focuses on pouring out the coffee. He\u2019d remembered at the last minute to bring sugar for Phil, so he digs out the packets from his pocket, and presses them into Phil\u2019s free hand along with a wooden stirrer.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0\u201cWhere abouts?\u201d<br/></p><p>For a moment, Phil says nothing. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s forgotten how to move, or speak. Dan just waits, the warmth of the coffee cup in his hands starting to spread through his gloved fingers, melting the stiffness. He sips his own coffee until Phil regains composure and pours the sugar in.<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, lots of places. My family used to go every year at Christmas.\u201d He stirs the coffee slowly, gazing out at the thick, snow-frosted trees lining the slope. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Andorra, Saalbach Chamonix\u2026\u201d<br/></p><p>This peaks Dan\u2019s attention. \u201cChamonix? I\u2019ve been there.\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes go round. \u201cOh my God\u2026 I knew I recognised you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan\u2019s stomach drops. \u201cW-what?\u201d Surely this cannot be happening.</p><p>\u201cThe New Year\u2019s Eve party\u2026\u201d he gushes, placing a hand on Dan\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, abort, abort, abort</i>. \u201cThere was karaoke&hellip; we were dragged on stage to sing a duet\u2026\u201d<br/></p><p>For a split second, Dan\u2019s mind is hurtling in circles as he tries to remember any such awful event, and then he notes the twitch of Phil\u2019s mouth, the glimmer of obvious teasing lurking in his expression. Right as Dan\u2019s about to grab a handful of snow and smash it into that obnoxious mocking face, Phil clutches his chest and belts out, \u201cthis is the\u00a0<i>start</i>\u00a0of something\u00a0<i>newww</i>!\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan groans, eyes rolling so far backwards he can see the folds of his brain. \u201cAs\u00a0<i>if</i>\u00a0you\u2019re making an actual High School Musical reference right now.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one that got it,\u201d Phil points out, giggling softly.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so irritating,\u201d Dan mutters, sipping more coffee.<br/></p><p>The snow has officially soaked all the way through his trousers, and his bum has gone entirely numb from the cold. If he has to sit here and listen to Phil\u2019s annoying, posh-boy teasing for a second longer, he\u2019s going to ski directly into a nearby tree.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you supposed to call your guests irritating?\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan fights a smile, hiding his mouth in his cup. \u201cDepends how much they piss me off.\u201d<br/></p><p>This makes Phil laugh; a sound Dan is sure he will never grow used to. \u201cAt least I have a dry bum right now. Your idea of appropriate ski attire is as shocking as your technique.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Dan says brightly, and stands up. He pretty much instantly regrets doing so as the cold water that\u2019s been soaking his bum for the last half hour trickles down the backs of his thighs. He chucks the remainder of his coffee into the snow, and pockets the cup along with the flask. \u201cBeing the official laughing stock of the slopes is not part of my job description. It\u2019s been a blast, Mr Novokoric, but I have a hotel to run, so if you\u2019ll excuse me-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOoh, back to Mr Novokoric, is it?\u201d Phil asks, standing up as well. He drains the last of his own coffee, and gathers his ski poles. \u201cHang on then, let me-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Dan says, swishing his ski pole at Phil as he tries to slide closer. \u201cI\u2019m clearly stopping you from throwing yourself down some more death-defying hills or whatever. I can get back to the hotel on my own just fine.\u201d<br/></p><p>He shoves his feet back into the skis one by one, thankfully able to tighten them to his feet without help this time, and then awkwardly shuffles around to face the direction they came from. There\u2019s a bit of a hill ahead, but in comparison to the one he climbed up not long ago it looks tiny, so he slides towards it with determination.<br/></p><p>\u201cDan, hold on,\u201d Phil says impatiently, still strapping himself back into his own skis. \u201cYou can\u2019t just-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m\u00a0<i>fine</i>,\u201d Dan says through gritted teeth. In truth however,\u00a0gaining any sort of momentum on this incline seems a lot harder than it had been previously. \u201cJust go do your thing.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s about halfway up the small hill, and he feels alarmingly unsteady. The skis seem to have a mind of their own, and keep threatening to slide out from under him. Dan just shoves his ski poles into the snow as hard as possible, using them to help drag him upwards.<br/></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil is calling from somewhere behind him. \u201cCan you stop being so pig-headed for a minute? You\u2019ve forgotten-\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan cuts him off with an embarrassingly high-pitched yelp as his right ski slips sharply backwards, splitting his legs wishbone-style. With the help of his ski pole, he manages not to rip his own crotch in half, but the back of his right ski crosses over his left, and in trying to correct it, Dan falls backwards. His right ankle seems to not want to cooperate with the angle Dan is toppling, and twists beneath him; his boot still being attached to the ski, this hurts like a motherfucker.<br/></p><p>\u201cShit! Ow, ow ow-\u201d<br/></p><p>Pain, scorching and sudden, shoots up Dan\u2019s leg. His ankle is bent somehow beneath him, and it\u2019s agony. He only has mere seconds to revel in the pain however, as then hands are on the strap of his ski, scrambling to unattach him, and blissfully his ankle pops free.<br/></p><p>\u201cI told you to wait for me!\u201d Phil shouts, though the sound is fuzzy and distant from the leftover cloud of pain hazing Dan\u2019s senses. \u201cYou forgot to put your skins back on, you idiot.\u201d Dan barely understands, too focused on his throbbing ankle. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes it bloody hurts!\u201d Dan snaps, clutching the ankle. &ldquo;What kind of idiotic question is that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDan, I need to see how bad it is.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan protests, but Phil is already picking at the knot of his laces, clearly not listening.<br/></p><p>As he reluctantly surrenders to Phil\u2019s insistence on acting the hero, Dan realises for the first time just how\u2026 close he is. At this level of proximity, it\u2019s possible to detect notes of the shampoo Phil uses dancing on the thin, icy breeze. Coconut, possibly. Or watermelon? In the distraction of trying to place the smell, Dan doesn\u2019t realise what\u2019s happening until his laces are untied, and Phil begins carefully pulling off his boot. He removes his gloves, and blows quickly on his hands before reaching out and rolling down Dan\u2019s thick sock. Something about this whole scenario is so intimate that Dan wants to squirm. Presumably, he\u2019d only blown on his fingers to warm them - to ease Dan\u2019s discomfort. Dan wouldn\u2019t expect such consideration from his own mother, let alone this dick-brain. To stifle his drumming heart, Dan bites down on his lip, and turns his face away.<br/></p><p>\u201cLooks swollen,\u201d Phil mutters as he pulls the sock down. Gently, he presses the pads of his fingers to the puffed, pink skin around Dan\u2019s ankle. It doesn\u2019t hurt any more than the existing pain, but Dan twitches nonetheless, and Phil\u2019s blisteringly blue eyes flick up to his.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel broken. Do you think you could stand on it?\u201d</p><p>Experimentally, Dan tries wiggling his toes. It\u2019s unpleasant, sure, but not completely unbearable. \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he says, attempting bravery.<br/></p><p>Phil begins rolling his sock back up. \u201cGood choice,\u201d he says, reaching for the boot. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me up here, so unless you fancy spending the night in minus six degrees under the stars, I\u2019d advise hopping if you can. It\u2019ll start getting dark in a few hours.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGee, thanks for the sympathy,\u201d Dan snorts, batting Phil\u2019s hands away to re-tie his laces.<br/></p><p>Phil waits, saying nothing, and when Dan is done, he holds out his hand. For a moment Dan just stares at it. He\u2019s seconds away from slipping his own hand into it, when Phil says, \u201cyour skins? I\u2019ll put them back on for you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Dan says, hoping Phil doesn\u2019t notice his odd behaviour. He has no clue what the fuck this mountain air is doing to him recently. He digs in his pocket and pulls out the skins, then shoves them into Phil\u2019s hand.\u00a0\u201cCheers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much more\u2026 bony than you look,\u201d Phil huffs.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re about halfway through the hideous journey back, as far as Dan can tell. Approximately three minutes in, Dan had realised that attempting to walk on his own, wearing the damn \u2018telemark\u2019 skis, was not an option.</p><p>\u201cI apologise sincerely for having bones,\u201d Dan replies scornfully. In truth, he feels like a pile of boneless goo, so it\u2019s surprising that Phil seems to think he\u2019s the opposite. His arm is wound around Phil\u2019s shoulders, allowing Dan to lean a great deal of his weight onto the other man. He\u2019s got one ski on, the other is in his right hand. Phil is carrying all four ski poles, tucked under his arm.\u00a0<br/></p><p>They\u2019ve been moving at a torturously slow pace, so the sun is already dipping towards the horizon at their backs. Even in the space of a few hours, Dan can feel the drop in temperature, and it wasn\u2019t exactly warm before. They were lucky, in a way, that Dan\u2019s little accident had happened whilst there was still a lot of light left. He leans closer into Phil\u2019s body heat, hoping the other man doesn\u2019t notice.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d<br/></p><p>Crap. \u201cUm, a bit.\u201d<br/></p><p>They hobble further on in silence. Dan wonders what the purpose of Phil\u2019s question might have been, as now he seems to be deliberating something silently. Please, God, don\u2019t say that Phil Novokoric is about to hand over his snow jacket to invalid-Dan so he can tell the story of his chivalry to some doe-eyed journalist months from now.\u00a0</p><p>In a way, Dan is almost glad when Phil, predictably, says, \u201canother reason to invest in some proper thermals. Might have been an idea, considering you\u2019re living up a snowy mountain.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Dan says through gritted teeth. Finally, the sight of the hotel crests the horizon, some way off still, but at least within view. \u201cThank the fucking Lord,\u201d he mutters under his breath.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou could get on my back for the last bit, if you like,\u201d Phil suggests, tone lilting into something like a tease.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alright, thanks,\u201d Dan replies tersely. He sincerely wishes he could extricate himself from this infuriating human and sprint the rest of the way back, but unfortunately he thinks he might snap his own ankle off, brittle as it is now from the cold. \u201cCan we just focus on getting to the hotel without any further injuries, please?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, then effortlessly hitches Dan\u2019s arm a little higher across his shoulders, taking on significantly more of his weight. For a reason Dan refuses to analyse, this action makes his stomach flip multiple times, but he has no time to dwell on the how\u2019s or why\u2019s, because Phil has doubled the pace now, near-dragging Dan along.<br/></p><p>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</p>",

The blood in Dan\u2019s wrist pulses in odd, shifting patterns beneath the skin. He swallows, caught on the edge of a gelid blue stare. \u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u00a0<i>ski</i>?\u201d Phil asks, his sneer an anchor that yanks Dan back down from the astral plane into which Phil\u2019s touch had propelled him.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u00a0<i>can</i>\u00a0ski,\u201d he retorts, bristling. He chooses not to mention that he hasn\u2019t skied since he was fourteen, when his family went to Chamonix for a week, and his mum and dad complained the entire time that it was too cold. At a\u00a0<i>ski lodge</i>. \u201cBut I have to\u2026 y\u2019know, work. Hotel stuff.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Mesmerised by the slight twitch of the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth, which still doesn\u2019t quite count as a smile, Dan\u2019s hostile stance falters, then wanes. Like it\u2019s a perfume wafting from Phil\u2019s skin through the air between them, in the next second Dan smells the imminence of his own surrender.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Phil says, his voice quiet, like it\u2019s just for Dan. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that nobody else could have heard him anyway. \u201cWhat else are you gonna do all day? Cook lunch for the hotel ghosts? Sit at reception and pretend you\u2019re not playing on your phone?\u201d</p><p>A spurt of blood shoots into Dan\u2019s cheeks; he\u2019d thought he was so stealthy, hiding his phone under the desk as he attempted to load a single meme at a time on Tumblr mobile, using tenuous 3G.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t have any skis,\u201d Dan says lamely.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you that my old ones were repaired by the elusive hotel elf, then,\u201d Phil quips, already stepping away. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you by the front door, shall I?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s gone before Dan can muster up a further refusal. He stands gormless in the middle of the kitchen, gazing around at the pristine surfaces. If only he\u2019d resisted the urge to clean everything already, then he could at least have the excuse of needing to scrub the day away. Perhaps he could quickly throw open all the cupboard doors, ransack the fridge and hurl ingredients and coffee everywhere, feigning a wolf had snuck in somehow, or a snow leopard.\u00a0</p><p>An image flashes into Dan\u2019s mind, of Mona\u2019s deepening frown as Phil explained to her that not only did Dan let some wild animal break in and contaminate the kitchen, but that he also refused to grant the one request of the only guest. He shudders, closing the door on that image before it can develop. Mona is already far too close to a stark realisation of Dan\u2019s utter hopelessness; despite the words of any fortune-telling crows, a voice lingers at the back of Dan\u2019s mind, assuring him that it\u2019s only a matter of time before he slips up and disappoints everyone. His only hope is to stall that inevitability for as long as possible.\u00a0</p><p>Plus Phil is, annoyingly, right. There is nothing else for Dan to do today; he and Mona did a deep clean of the whole hotel before she left, and the place is spotless. With no guests to look after, and a low chance of anyone phoning given that the Swiss news helpfully predicted a terrifying blizzard, Dan really is at a loose end.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>It takes about two minutes of dithering in the kitchen before he has to admit defeat. Dan lets out a dreaded sigh, pushing all the air from his lungs, and then goes to wash up the two mugs he\u2019s still holding. As he\u2019s scrubbing the coffee stains, he decides that caffeine is the only acceptable (or available) drug he can utilise to get through whatever lies in store, so he places the mugs on the drying rack, and rinses out a thermos flask he finds, along with Louise\u2019s percolator. He makes the coffee very strong, pours it into the flask, then thinks for a moment, and adds a dollop of soya milk.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as he opens his chest of drawers, Dan is struck once again by how ill-prepared he is for a sudden, impulsive foray into the snowy wilderness. As he lacks proper \u2018ski-wear\u2019 - whatever that might be - Dan Instead chooses to go for layers. A clingy t-shirt that barely fit him when he was sixteen, then a baggier, long-sleeved t-shirt. He covers these with a shapeless grey jumper, then a black jacket, and then, finally his warmest coat. He adds thick socks, a hat, boots, sunglasses, gloves and a scarf. By the time he feels he\u2019s ready, his arms stick out stiffly from his sides, but he figures that a little loss of movement is a fair price to pay for not getting frostbite.\u00a0<br></p><p>He slots the flask into one of the deep pockets of his coat, and tries not to think too hard about what he\u2019s about to do. Or with whom. He deliberately takes his time getting down to the lobby in order to prolong the inevitable, and also because he likes the idea of the Fresh Prince of the Alps having to wait for him. Phil\u00a0lowers his phone as Dan approaches, pushing off from where he\u2019s leant against the wall. It takes a moment for him to drink in the sight of Dan, and then his eyebrows shoot up, and he seems to swallow something suspiciously close to a laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cErr, think you\u2019ll be warm enough?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly pack for extreme sports.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil just makes a \u2018hmm\u2019 noise, turning to the collection of skis and poles leaning against the wall. \u201cNot sure cross-country skiing could be classed as an extreme sport, but you do y- er, suit yourself.\u201d<br></p><p>If Dan tries to reply, he\u2019ll probably swear, so he clamps his mouth shut, and sticks an arm out to grab for the the red skis. Phil snatches them up first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear these,\u201d he says. \u201cYou take the new ones.\u201d<br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t look at Dan, just pushes the shiny new skis into his hands. Bewildered, Dan stares at his warped reflection in the electric blue varnish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d<br></p><p>It takes a minute for Phil to respond; he\u2019s tugging at the repaired bracket on the red ski, seemingly to test its durability. This alone is enough to make Dan want to slap it out of his hands. Then, he turns to Dan, that vague almost-smile still tucked beneath his smug expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t tested the new ones out yet,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cReckon it\u2019d be better for my caddy to fall on his face than me, right?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan splutters, outraged. \u201c<i>Caddy?</i>\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGrab those ski poles for us, would you?\u201d Phil asks, a spritz of amusement perfuming his words.\u00a0</p><p>Dan might be intrigued by the lightness of his tone if it weren\u2019t for the fact he were quietly steaming inside his many layers. The heating in this place does not fuck about. Worried he\u2019ll boil alive unless they get outside soon, Dan chooses to just do as he\u2019s asked. If Phil insists on calling him a caddy again, at least Dan will have four long weapons to wield.\u00a0Dan gathers the four poles up in his arms as best he can, along with his own skis; on the verge of dropping everything, he opts for speed, and scurries after Phil out of the front door.</p><p>\u201cIf you expect me to haul all of this up some peak or other-\u201d<br></p><p>Dan can\u2019t see, as he\u2019s got a number of pointed objects obscuring his view, so he doesn\u2019t realise that Phil has stopped directly in front of him, a few paces beyond the door. Dan bumps straight into him, and instantly everything he\u2019s holding drops to the ground. When he looks up, Phil is aiming an exasperated gaze down at the pile of poles and skis, as if he\u2019s already regretting inviting Dan along.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t expect you to actually be my pack mule. We\u2019re going to\u00a0<i>wear</i>\u00a0our skis,\u201d Phil explains slowly, like he\u2019s talking to a child.<br></p><p>He\u2019s already got his skis laid neatly out in front of him - two bright red parallel lines striking through the snow. As Dan watches confusedly, Phil pushes the tip of his right boot into one of the skis. Dan\u2019s stomach squeezes with discomfort; he\u2019d been correct before, when repairing the skis. The fastenings are not the same as he\u2019s used to.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cErm,\u201d Dan says, moving his attention to one of his own skis, laying at an angle in the snow. It has the same unfamiliar fastening, much to his dismay.\u00a0<br></p><p>Mind racing to figure out every option available to him that doesn\u2019t involve swallowing his pride and asking Phil for help, Dan moves to inspect the contraption. As if he\u2019s sensed Dan\u2019s incompetence, Phil drops into a crouch anyway, and reaches for Dan\u2019s boot. Instinctively, Dan jerks his foot away. Phil lifts his head to look at Dan. Viewing him from this angle is strange. From this perspective, he seems hunched, small, insignificant. He has none of his Lordly airs about him, hunched down in the snow near Dan\u2019s feet. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything, he just waits, hand calmly outstretched towards Dan\u2019s boot.\u00a0Wordlessly, Dan moves his foot back into Phil\u2019s reach, and watches as Phil carefully rights the ski, then pulls his foot towards it. He fits the toe of Dan\u2019s boot into the unusual strap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re telemark skis,\u201d Phil says, tightening the strap around the ball of Dan\u2019s foot. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re more used to Alpine skis? They\u2019re the ones with the strap at the back as well.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan bristles again at the condescending tone. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with both,\u201d he says, because he\u2019s a stubborn moron. Phil says nothing, but that near-smile returns as he reaches for Dan\u2019s other foot; Dan wobbles slightly as Phil guides it into the left ski. \u201cBut, uh, it\u2019s been a while. So\u2026 remind me again of the difference between, er, telemark and\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlpine,\u201d Phil supplies, standing up. He holds Dan\u2019s gaze for a moment, and then laughs, short and quiet, but just enough for Dan to catch a glimpse of two rows of pearl-white teeth, with a flash of pink tongue caught between them. It\u2019s the most Dan\u2019s seen him smile yet, though he\u2019s obviously laughing\u00a0<i>at</i>\u00a0Dan which isn\u2019t ideal. \u201cTelemark skis are designed so that you can wear them for both hiking and skiing. You can move your ankle in them, see?\u201d<br></p><p>He demonstrates, twisting his un-strapped heel to and fro. Dan tries to do the same, and almost falls over. \u201cWhy do we need to use our ankles, exactly?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t remember skiing requiring a lot of joint movement. From what he can recall of his brief experience as a teenager, he strapped the skis on, let the lift drag him up a big hill, and gravity did a lot of the work getting him to the bottom again.<br></p><p>Phil is full-on smirking now. Dan thinks he preferred the non-smile. \u201cYou may have noticed that we don\u2019t have chairlifts up here. We\u2019ll be hiking to the slopes on foot. I\u2019ve put skins on the bottom of these to give us more grip, but we can take them off when we get there.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan tries not let the alarm show on his face. They\u2019re going to be walking up hills? In skis? \u201cAnd\u2026 I suppose once we ski down the slope we\u2019ll be having to\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWalk back up again? Yes. Unless you fancy setting up camp down there.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>An ill-timed image of the Brokeback Mountain tent attacks Dan so viciously it nearly knocks him sideways.\u00a0\u201cNo! No, no. Walking back up. Cool. Good thing I\u2019ve been practicing with those bloody hotel stairs, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan forces a laugh, but this time Phil\u2019s face remains unmoved. Clearly it\u2019s only Dan\u2019s unintentional idiocy that can procure a genuine smile from him then, right.\u00a0</p><p>Phil looks to the sky briefly, seeming to assess something in the heavens themselves, and asks, \u201cready to go, then?\u201d<br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for Dan\u2019s reply. He picks up his ski poles, then turns and begins sort of slide-walking away from the hotel, in seemingly no particular direction. There\u2019s a large thicket of trees ahead of him, but then there are thickets of trees in a few other directions too. Nevertheless, Dan has no choice but to trust this man\u2019s sense of direction, so attempts to move after him; to his horror, his legs immediately split apart in a move he is certainly not flexible enough to achieve. He manages to stab his ski poles into the earth and rectify himself before pulling anything, but in doing so he flails, and almost falls. Luckily, he\u2019s gotten back into a reasonably dignified standing position by the time Phil turns to him, wondering what the hold up is.<br></p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan says, making a valiant attempt to copy Phil\u2019s movements exactly as he inches forwards again. It works, sort of, though he doesn\u2019t do it anywhere near as gracefully as Phil seems to be able to. When he gets to Phil, he shrugs, like he\u2019s totally fine. \u201cJust\u2026 admiring the view,\u201d he explains. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It takes over thirty gruelling minutes to cross the plains of the mountain in pursuit of a supposedly safe ski-area, but eventually they reach an abrupt dip, where the mountain begins its gradual slope downward. This close to the edge of the mountain, the view is breathtaking. Dan can\u2019t focus on it, however, because his thighs ache, the moisture in his lungs has turned to ice and is freezing him from the inside out, and for the last twenty minutes, Phil Novokoric has been unhelpfully telling him everything he\u2019s doing wrong with the stupid\u00a0\u2018telemark\u2019 skis.<br></p><p>\u201cIs this where we do some actual skiing then?\u201d Dan asks crossly, jamming his poles into the snow.<br></p><p>He\u2019s so glad to get to a point where he actually knows what he\u2019s doing that he\u2019s already shuffling up to the edge of the slope, more than ready to get this over with. He\u2019s so keen, in fact, that he\u2019s only just about saved from teetering over the edge and hurtling down in an enormous cartoon-style snowball, by a far more sensible Phil. He grabs Dan by the hood of his coat before he can topple to his untimely death.<br></p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d he exclaims as he yanks Dan backwards. Yet again, the irritating warning is at least ten seconds too late. Dan has already been an idiot; unless Phil expects him to travel back in time to ten seconds ago, and take heed of Phil\u2019s caution. Phil pulls him so sharply that Dan jolts backwards, skis slotting between Phil\u2019s as his back crashes against his chest. His heart pounds incessantly. Or maybe that\u2019s Phil\u2019s heart. \u201cAre you some kind of moron?\u201d Phil asks, then pauses, like he\u2019s actually waiting for an answer. \u201cJust\u00a0<i>wait\u00a0</i>a minute, we\u2019ve got to take our skins off. Then\u00a0<i>I\u2019ll</i>\u00a0lead the way.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRemind me why I agreed to this,\u201d Dan mutters, carefully sliding away from Phil whilst trying not to accidentally fall down the slope.\u00a0</p><p>Sulkily, he stands to the side and watches as Phil removes one ski, and peels a thin black strip from the underside, then does the same to the other. Dan copies his action in silence, though he has no idea why on earth this is necessary. Phil monitors Dan wordlessly, but thankfully makes no judgemental comments.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks once Dan has his de-skinned skis back on.\u00a0</p><p>Dan shoves the bunched up skins into his jacket pocket.\u00a0<i>No</i>. \u201cYep.\u201d<br></p><p>And then, with enviable ease, Phil pushes himself over the edge of the slope, and begins drifting downwards, swaying gracefully to and fro as he descends. Somewhat alarmed by how quickly that just happened, Dan swallows his nerves and shoots after him. It\u2019s\u00a0<i>terrifying</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Dan hasn\u2019t experienced this level of self-propelled velocity for years, let alone the searing chill that whips his cheeks, or the sensation of being at once in control of his own speed, and simultaneously ill-equipped to do so. He grips his ski poles tightly, attempting to copy Phil\u2019s swooping motions up ahead, leaning left and right as much as he dares in order to slow his pace. The slope had not looked particularly steep from the top, but Dan should probably have been more concerned about the amount of debris on the path that he has to keep swerving to avoid. Annoyingly, Phil was completely right in insisting he went first, as otherwise Dan would have crashed several times into boulders and tree stumps and icy patches.<br></p><p>It can\u2019t last particularly long, but it seems to Dan that he\u2019s skiing, teeth gritted, eyes frozen open, for hours. Eventually however, the slope evens out, and flattens enough that they slow to a stop. Somewhere in the recesses of Dan\u2019s brain, he scrounges up his knowledge of how to point the tips of his skis together to halt himself. Phil does some kind of impressive, sudden, 90 degree turning move, but he doesn\u2019t outright laugh at Dan\u2019s less stylish method, thankfully.</p><p>Dan is just about to collapse to the floor and weep, relieved he survived that and didn\u2019t so much as fall over once, when Phil pulls off his sunglasses, and gives Dan the widest, most brilliant grin. His teeth are as white as the snow surrounding them. Seeing such animation on his usually sullen features is so unexpected that Dan swears his heart literally skips a beat, though that might be on account of all the adrenaline from plummeting down the side of a mountain. Dan removes his own sunglasses, somewhat shakily, and aims a tentative smile back at him.<br></p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Phil says, eyes bright and crystalline in the light. \u201cIf you did some fitness training, you might be halfway decent.\u201d<br></p><p>The smile wipes itself away again. \u201cThanks,\u201d Dan mutters.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d Phil asks, elbow resting on one of his upright ski poles. He\u2019s a tiny bit breathless, which gives his words a whisperish quality. In another setting that wasn\u2019t as eerily silent, it might be difficult to hear him. \u201cFun, right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that,\u201d Dan replies, heart still pounding at double his normal rate.<br></p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cThis is probably the gentlest path I\u2019ve found.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFound?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t be certain of course, but I doubt anyone else has ever skied up here.\u201d He grins again, jarring and hypnotic. \u201cI\u2019m the Columbus of the Alps.\u201d<br></p><p>This seems highly unlikely. Dan\u2019s no expert in mountaineering, but surely other adventurers have come up and explored the mountain before now. Phil being the first one to ever scope out reasonably skiable pathways seems incredibly dangerous, and probably illegal.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you, like, allowed?\u201d<br></p><p>Phil shrugs, slipping his shades back on. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna stop me?\u201d<br></p><p>It\u2019s this offhanded, entitled flippancy that Dan detests about the rich. He chooses not to respond to such an irritating question, and instead asks, \u201cso, what now?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cClimb back up,\u201d Phil says, already pulling his skins from his pocket. \u201cUnless you wanna check out one of the trickier slopes?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Dan says tightly.<br></p><p>Phil chuckles again. \u201cAlright then, skins on, Howell.\u201d<br></p><p>*<br></p><p>In hindsight, Dan should really have given more thought to the idea of climbing back up the hill they\u2019d just skied down, in skis. To say it was difficult would have been generous. By the time they reach the top (it shouldn\u2019t go unmentioned that Phil was much, much quicker than Dan at getting back up, and then shouted helpful suggestions of how he should turn his heels, or dig his skis in to the snow from the summit) Dan is so exhausted he never wants to lift another limb in his life, let alone slide down a hill just to climb it yet again. Phil is raring to go, of course, but Dan simply unfastens his skis and falls back onto his bum, unconcerned that the snow immediately begins seeping into the seat of his trousers, and gestures for the other man to go on without him.<br></p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Phil says, snickering, and pushes over the edge.<br></p><p>From his position, Dan is able to watch as Phil airily glides down. It\u2019s obvious, from this vantage point, that skiing gives Phil an air of freedom that he lacks in everyday life. His limbs are loosened of their usual tension, and even from a distance Dan can see that he is calm and happy. As Phil re-climbs the slope, Dan peels off the weird skins from the underside of his skis again and studies them for a bit, then stuffs them into his pocket, deciding they\u2019re just flaps of fabric you could make in five seconds, probably sold in sports shops at an absurd cost. He then attempts to browse the internet on his phone, though given that they\u2019re currently in the middle of absolutely nowhere, this does not go well. He quickly abandons any attempt to check his Facebook feed, and plays Crossy Road until a shadow washes over him. He looks up just as Phil slumps down beside him, panting.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence on me,\u201d Phil says between breaths. \u201cUsually I do this about twenty times, up and down. On the steeper slopes, too.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cExcuse me, but screw that. Nobody told me there\u2019d be climbing involved. Give me a terrifying ski lift any day.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnywhere there\u2019s a ski lift there\u2019s a hundred tourists crammed on, waiting to dawdle in front of you on the slope on the way down.\u201d<br></p><p>Again, Dan doesn\u2019t remember this being particularly true from his previous skiing experience. On the red and black runs, there were only a handful of other people to avoid. He can see nothing wrong with something being made safe by professionals. Deciding it\u2019s probably wise to keep this thought to himself in order to keep the peace, Dan instead digs the flask of coffee out of his pocket, pulls both the plastic cups off the top, and hands one to Phil.<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve skied in a lot of places, then?\u201d he asks.<br></p><p>Phil is looking down at the cup like Dan just pulled it out of his rear end. \u201cEr\u2026 yeah. Quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Dan ignores the curious expression being aimed at him, and just focuses on pouring out the coffee. He\u2019d remembered at the last minute to bring sugar for Phil, so he digs out the packets from his pocket, and presses them into Phil\u2019s free hand along with a wooden stirrer.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0\u201cWhere abouts?\u201d<br></p><p>For a moment, Phil says nothing. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s forgotten how to move, or speak. Dan just waits, the warmth of the coffee cup in his hands starting to spread through his gloved fingers, melting the stiffness. He sips his own coffee until Phil regains composure and pours the sugar in.<br></p><p>\u201cUh, lots of places. My family used to go every year at Christmas.\u201d He stirs the coffee slowly, gazing out at the thick, snow-frosted trees lining the slope. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Andorra, Saalbach Chamonix\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>This peaks Dan\u2019s attention. \u201cChamonix? I\u2019ve been there.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes go round. \u201cOh my God\u2026 I knew I recognised you.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan\u2019s stomach drops. \u201cW-what?\u201d Surely this cannot be happening.</p><p>\u201cThe New Year\u2019s Eve party\u2026\u201d he gushes, placing a hand on Dan\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, abort, abort, abort</i>. \u201cThere was karaoke\u2026 we were dragged on stage to sing a duet\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>For a split second, Dan\u2019s mind is hurtling in circles as he tries to remember any such awful event, and then he notes the twitch of Phil\u2019s mouth, the glimmer of obvious teasing lurking in his expression. Right as Dan\u2019s about to grab a handful of snow and smash it into that obnoxious mocking face, Phil clutches his chest and belts out, \u201cthis is the\u00a0<i>start</i>\u00a0of something\u00a0<i>newww</i>!\u201d<br></p><p>Dan groans, eyes rolling so far backwards he can see the folds of his brain. \u201cAs\u00a0<i>if</i>\u00a0you\u2019re making an actual High School Musical reference right now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one that got it,\u201d Phil points out, giggling softly.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so irritating,\u201d Dan mutters, sipping more coffee.<br></p><p>The snow has officially soaked all the way through his trousers, and his bum has gone entirely numb from the cold. If he has to sit here and listen to Phil\u2019s annoying, posh-boy teasing for a second longer, he\u2019s going to ski directly into a nearby tree.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you supposed to call your guests irritating?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan fights a smile, hiding his mouth in his cup. \u201cDepends how much they piss me off.\u201d<br></p><p>This makes Phil laugh; a sound Dan is sure he will never grow used to. \u201cAt least I have a dry bum right now. Your idea of appropriate ski attire is as shocking as your technique.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Dan says brightly, and stands up. He pretty much instantly regrets doing so as the cold water that\u2019s been soaking his bum for the last half hour trickles down the backs of his thighs. He chucks the remainder of his coffee into the snow, and pockets the cup along with the flask. \u201cBeing the official laughing stock of the slopes is not part of my job description. It\u2019s been a blast, Mr Novokoric, but I have a hotel to run, so if you\u2019ll excuse me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOoh, back to Mr Novokoric, is it?\u201d Phil asks, standing up as well. He drains the last of his own coffee, and gathers his ski poles. \u201cHang on then, let me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Dan says, swishing his ski pole at Phil as he tries to slide closer. \u201cI\u2019m clearly stopping you from throwing yourself down some more death-defying hills or whatever. I can get back to the hotel on my own just fine.\u201d<br></p><p>He shoves his feet back into the skis one by one, thankfully able to tighten them to his feet without help this time, and then awkwardly shuffles around to face the direction they came from. There\u2019s a bit of a hill ahead, but in comparison to the one he climbed up not long ago it looks tiny, so he slides towards it with determination.<br></p><p>\u201cDan, hold on,\u201d Phil says impatiently, still strapping himself back into his own skis. \u201cYou can\u2019t just-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m\u00a0<i>fine</i>,\u201d Dan says through gritted teeth. In truth however,\u00a0gaining any sort of momentum on this incline seems a lot harder than it had been previously. \u201cJust go do your thing.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s about halfway up the small hill, and he feels alarmingly unsteady. The skis seem to have a mind of their own, and keep threatening to slide out from under him. Dan just shoves his ski poles into the snow as hard as possible, using them to help drag him upwards.<br></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil is calling from somewhere behind him. \u201cCan you stop being so pig-headed for a minute? You\u2019ve forgotten-\u201d<br></p><p>Dan cuts him off with an embarrassingly high-pitched yelp as his right ski slips sharply backwards, splitting his legs wishbone-style. With the help of his ski pole, he manages not to rip his own crotch in half, but the back of his right ski crosses over his left, and in trying to correct it, Dan falls backwards. His right ankle seems to not want to cooperate with the angle Dan is toppling, and twists beneath him; his boot still being attached to the ski, this hurts like a motherfucker.<br></p><p>\u201cShit! Ow, ow ow-\u201d<br></p><p>Pain, scorching and sudden, shoots up Dan\u2019s leg. His ankle is bent somehow beneath him, and it\u2019s agony. He only has mere seconds to revel in the pain however, as then hands are on the strap of his ski, scrambling to unattach him, and blissfully his ankle pops free.<br></p><p>\u201cI told you to wait for me!\u201d Phil shouts, though the sound is fuzzy and distant from the leftover cloud of pain hazing Dan\u2019s senses. \u201cYou forgot to put your skins back on, you idiot.\u201d Dan barely understands, too focused on his throbbing ankle. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes it bloody hurts!\u201d Dan snaps, clutching the ankle. \u201cWhat kind of idiotic question is that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDan, I need to see how bad it is.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan protests, but Phil is already picking at the knot of his laces, clearly not listening.<br></p><p>As he reluctantly surrenders to Phil\u2019s insistence on acting the hero, Dan realises for the first time just how\u2026 close he is. At this level of proximity, it\u2019s possible to detect notes of the shampoo Phil uses dancing on the thin, icy breeze. Coconut, possibly. Or watermelon? In the distraction of trying to place the smell, Dan doesn\u2019t realise what\u2019s happening until his laces are untied, and Phil begins carefully pulling off his boot. He removes his gloves, and blows quickly on his hands before reaching out and rolling down Dan\u2019s thick sock. Something about this whole scenario is so intimate that Dan wants to squirm. Presumably, he\u2019d only blown on his fingers to warm them - to ease Dan\u2019s discomfort. Dan wouldn\u2019t expect such consideration from his own mother, let alone this dick-brain. To stifle his drumming heart, Dan bites down on his lip, and turns his face away.<br></p><p>\u201cLooks swollen,\u201d Phil mutters as he pulls the sock down. Gently, he presses the pads of his fingers to the puffed, pink skin around Dan\u2019s ankle. It doesn\u2019t hurt any more than the existing pain, but Dan twitches nonetheless, and Phil\u2019s blisteringly blue eyes flick up to his.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel broken. Do you think you could stand on it?\u201d</p><p>Experimentally, Dan tries wiggling his toes. It\u2019s unpleasant, sure, but not completely unbearable. \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he says, attempting bravery.<br></p><p>Phil begins rolling his sock back up. \u201cGood choice,\u201d he says, reaching for the boot. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me up here, so unless you fancy spending the night in minus six degrees under the stars, I\u2019d advise hopping if you can. It\u2019ll start getting dark in a few hours.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGee, thanks for the sympathy,\u201d Dan snorts, batting Phil\u2019s hands away to re-tie his laces.<br></p><p>Phil waits, saying nothing, and when Dan is done, he holds out his hand. For a moment Dan just stares at it. He\u2019s seconds away from slipping his own hand into it, when Phil says, \u201cyour skins? I\u2019ll put them back on for you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Dan says, hoping Phil doesn\u2019t notice his odd behaviour. He has no clue what the fuck this mountain air is doing to him recently. He digs in his pocket and pulls out the skins, then shoves them into Phil\u2019s hand.\u00a0\u201cCheers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much more\u2026 bony than you look,\u201d Phil huffs.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re about halfway through the hideous journey back, as far as Dan can tell. Approximately three minutes in, Dan had realised that attempting to walk on his own, wearing the damn \u2018telemark\u2019 skis, was not an option.</p><p>\u201cI apologise sincerely for having bones,\u201d Dan replies scornfully. In truth, he feels like a pile of boneless goo, so it\u2019s surprising that Phil seems to think he\u2019s the opposite. His arm is wound around Phil\u2019s shoulders, allowing Dan to lean a great deal of his weight onto the other man. He\u2019s got one ski on, the other is in his right hand. Phil is carrying all four ski poles, tucked under his arm.\u00a0<br></p><p>They\u2019ve been moving at a torturously slow pace, so the sun is already dipping towards the horizon at their backs. Even in the space of a few hours, Dan can feel the drop in temperature, and it wasn\u2019t exactly warm before. They were lucky, in a way, that Dan\u2019s little accident had happened whilst there was still a lot of light left. He leans closer into Phil\u2019s body heat, hoping the other man doesn\u2019t notice.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d<br></p><p>Crap. \u201cUm, a bit.\u201d<br></p><p>They hobble further on in silence. Dan wonders what the purpose of Phil\u2019s question might have been, as now he seems to be deliberating something silently. Please, God, don\u2019t say that Phil Novokoric is about to hand over his snow jacket to invalid-Dan so he can tell the story of his chivalry to some doe-eyed journalist months from now.\u00a0</p><p>In a way, Dan is almost glad when Phil, predictably, says, \u201canother reason to invest in some proper thermals. Might have been an idea, considering you\u2019re living up a snowy mountain.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Dan says through gritted teeth. Finally, the sight of the hotel crests the horizon, some way off still, but at least within view. \u201cThank the fucking Lord,\u201d he mutters under his breath.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou could get on my back for the last bit, if you like,\u201d Phil suggests, tone lilting into something like a tease.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alright, thanks,\u201d Dan replies tersely. He sincerely wishes he could extricate himself from this infuriating human and sprint the rest of the way back, but unfortunately he thinks he might snap his own ankle off, brittle as it is now from the cold. \u201cCan we just focus on getting to the hotel without any further injuries, please?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, then effortlessly hitches Dan\u2019s arm a little higher across his shoulders, taking on significantly more of his weight. For a reason Dan refuses to analyse, this action makes his stomach flip multiple times, but he has no time to dwell on the how\u2019s or why\u2019s, because Phil has doubled the pace now, near-dragging Dan along.<br></p><p>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a></p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>For a moment, no words will come. The blood in Dan\u2019s wrist pulses in odd, shifting patterns beneath the skin. He swallows, caught on the edge of a gelid blue stare. \u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u00a0<i>ski</i>?\u201d Phil asks, his sneer an anchor that yanks Dan back down from the astral plane into which Phil\u2019s touch had propelled him.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u00a0<i>can</i>\u00a0ski,\u201d he retorts, bristling. He chooses not to mention that he hasn\u2019t skied since he was fourteen, when his family went to Chamonix for a week, and his mum and dad complained the entire time that it was too cold. At a\u00a0<i>ski lodge</i>. \u201cBut I have to\u2026 y\u2019know, work. Hotel stuff.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Mesmerised by the slight twitch of the corner of Phil\u2019s mouth, which still doesn\u2019t quite count as a smile, Dan\u2019s hostile stance falters, then wanes. Like it\u2019s a perfume wafting from Phil\u2019s skin through the air between them, in the next second Dan smells the imminence of his own surrender.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Phil says, his voice quiet, like it\u2019s just for Dan. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that nobody else could have heard him anyway. \u201cWhat else are you gonna do all day? Cook lunch for the hotel ghosts? Sit at reception and pretend you\u2019re not playing on your phone?\u201d</p><p>A spurt of blood shoots into Dan\u2019s cheeks; he\u2019d thought he was so stealthy, hiding his phone under the desk as he attempted to load a single meme at a time on Tumblr mobile, using tenuous 3G.</p><p>\u201cI- I don\u2019t have any skis,\u201d Dan says lamely.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you that my old ones were repaired by the elusive hotel elf, then,\u201d Phil quips, already stepping away. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you by the front door, shall I?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s gone before Dan can muster up a further refusal. He stands gormless in the middle of the kitchen, gazing around at the pristine surfaces. If only he\u2019d resisted the urge to clean everything already, then he could at least have the excuse of needing to scrub the day away. Perhaps he could quickly throw open all the cupboard doors, ransack the fridge and hurl ingredients and coffee everywhere, feigning a wolf had snuck in somehow, or a snow leopard.\u00a0</p><p>An image flashes into Dan\u2019s mind, of Mona\u2019s deepening frown as Phil explained to her that not only did Dan let some wild animal break in and contaminate the kitchen, but that he also refused to grant the one request of the only guest. He shudders, closing the door on that image before it can develop. Mona is already far too close to a stark realisation of Dan\u2019s utter hopelessness; despite the words of any fortune-telling crows, a voice lingers at the back of Dan\u2019s mind, assuring him that it\u2019s only a matter of time before he slips up and disappoints everyone. His only hope is to stall that inevitability for as long as possible.\u00a0</p><p>Plus Phil is, annoyingly, right. There is nothing else for Dan to do today; he and Mona did a deep clean of the whole hotel before she left, and the place is spotless. With no guests to look after, and a low chance of anyone phoning given that the Swiss news helpfully predicted a terrifying blizzard, Dan really is at a loose end.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>It takes about two minutes of dithering in the kitchen before he has to admit defeat. Dan lets out a dreaded sigh, pushing all the air from his lungs, and then goes to wash up the two mugs he\u2019s still holding. As he\u2019s scrubbing the coffee stains, he decides that caffeine is the only acceptable (or available) drug he can utilise to get through whatever lies in store, so he places the mugs on the drying rack, and rinses out a thermos flask he finds, along with Louise\u2019s percolator. He makes the coffee very strong, pours it into the flask, then thinks for a moment, and adds a dollop of soya milk.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as he opens his chest of drawers, Dan is struck once again by how ill-prepared he is for a sudden, impulsive foray into the snowy wilderness. As he lacks proper \u2018ski-wear\u2019 - whatever that might be - Dan Instead chooses to go for layers. A clingy t-shirt that barely fit him when he was sixteen, then a baggier, long-sleeved t-shirt. He covers these with a shapeless grey jumper, then a black jacket, and then, finally his warmest coat. He adds thick socks, a hat, boots, sunglasses, gloves and a scarf. By the time he feels he\u2019s ready, his arms stick out stiffly from his sides, but he figures that a little loss of movement is a fair price to pay for not getting frostbite.\u00a0<br></p><p>He slots the flask into one of the deep pockets of his coat, and tries not to think too hard about what he\u2019s about to do. Or with whom. He deliberately takes his time getting down to the lobby in order to prolong the inevitable, and also because he likes the idea of the Fresh Prince of the Alps having to wait for him. Phil\u00a0lowers his phone as Dan approaches, pushing off from where he\u2019s leant against the wall. It takes a moment for him to drink in the sight of Dan, and then his eyebrows shoot up, and he seems to swallow something suspiciously close to a laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cErr, think you\u2019ll be warm enough?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly pack for extreme sports.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil just makes a \u2018hmm\u2019 noise, turning to the collection of skis and poles leaning against the wall. \u201cNot sure cross-country skiing could be classed as an extreme sport, but you do y- er, suit yourself.\u201d<br></p><p>If Dan tries to reply, he\u2019ll probably swear, so he clamps his mouth shut, and sticks an arm out to grab for the the red skis. Phil snatches them up first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear these,\u201d he says. \u201cYou take the new ones.\u201d<br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t look at Dan, just pushes the shiny new skis into his hands. Bewildered, Dan stares at his warped reflection in the electric blue varnish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d<br></p><p>It takes a minute for Phil to respond; he\u2019s tugging at the repaired bracket on the red ski, seemingly to test its durability. This alone is enough to make Dan want to slap it out of his hands. Then, he turns to Dan, that vague almost-smile still tucked beneath his smug expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t tested the new ones out yet,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cReckon it\u2019d be better for my caddy to fall on his face than me, right?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan splutters, outraged. \u201c<i>Caddy?</i>\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGrab those ski poles for us, would you?\u201d Phil asks, a spritz of amusement perfuming his words.\u00a0</p><p>Dan might be intrigued by the lightness of his tone if it weren\u2019t for the fact he were quietly steaming inside his many layers. The heating in this place does not fuck about. Worried he\u2019ll boil alive unless they get outside soon, Dan chooses to just do as he\u2019s asked. If Phil insists on calling him a caddy again, at least Dan will have four long weapons to wield.\u00a0Dan gathers the four poles up in his arms as best he can, along with his own skis; on the verge of dropping everything, he opts for speed, and scurries after Phil out of the front door.</p><p>\u201cIf you expect me to haul all of this up some peak or other-\u201d<br></p><p>Dan can\u2019t see, as he\u2019s got a number of pointed objects obscuring his view, so he doesn\u2019t realise that Phil has stopped directly in front of him, a few paces beyond the door. Dan bumps straight into him, and instantly everything he\u2019s holding drops to the ground. When he looks up, Phil is aiming an exasperated gaze down at the pile of poles and skis, as if he\u2019s already regretting inviting Dan along.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t expect you to actually be my pack mule. We\u2019re going to\u00a0<i>wear</i>\u00a0our skis,\u201d Phil explains slowly, like he\u2019s talking to a child.<br></p><p>He\u2019s already got his skis laid neatly out in front of him - two bright red parallel lines striking through the snow. As Dan watches confusedly, Phil pushes the tip of his right boot into one of the skis. Dan\u2019s stomach squeezes with discomfort; he\u2019d been correct before, when repairing the skis. The fastenings are not the same as he\u2019s used to.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cErm,\u201d Dan says, moving his attention to one of his own skis, laying at an angle in the snow. It has the same unfamiliar fastening, much to his dismay.\u00a0<br></p><p>Mind racing to figure out every option available to him that doesn\u2019t involve swallowing his pride and asking Phil for help, Dan moves to inspect the contraption. As if he\u2019s sensed Dan\u2019s incompetence, Phil drops into a crouch anyway, and reaches for Dan\u2019s boot. Instinctively, Dan jerks his foot away. Phil lifts his head to look at Dan. Viewing him from this angle is strange. From this perspective, he seems hunched, small, insignificant. He has none of his Lordly airs about him, hunched down in the snow near Dan\u2019s feet. Phil doesn\u2019t say anything, he just waits, hand calmly outstretched towards Dan\u2019s boot.\u00a0Wordlessly, Dan moves his foot back into Phil\u2019s reach, and watches as Phil carefully rights the ski, then pulls his foot towards it. He fits the toe of Dan\u2019s boot into the unusual strap.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re telemark skis,\u201d Phil says, tightening the strap around the ball of Dan\u2019s foot. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re more used to Alpine skis? They\u2019re the ones with the strap at the back as well.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan bristles again at the condescending tone. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with both,\u201d he says, because he\u2019s a stubborn moron. Phil says nothing, but that near-smile returns as he reaches for Dan\u2019s other foot; Dan wobbles slightly as Phil guides it into the left ski. \u201cBut, uh, it\u2019s been a while. So\u2026 remind me again of the difference between, er, telemark and\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAlpine,\u201d Phil supplies, standing up. He holds Dan\u2019s gaze for a moment, and then laughs, short and quiet, but just enough for Dan to catch a glimpse of two rows of pearl-white teeth, with a flash of pink tongue caught between them. It\u2019s the most Dan\u2019s seen him smile yet, though he\u2019s obviously laughing\u00a0<i>at</i>\u00a0Dan which isn\u2019t ideal. \u201cTelemark skis are designed so that you can wear them for both hiking and skiing. You can move your ankle in them, see?\u201d<br></p><p>He demonstrates, twisting his un-strapped heel to and fro. Dan tries to do the same, and almost falls over. \u201cWhy do we need to use our ankles, exactly?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t remember skiing requiring a lot of joint movement. From what he can recall of his brief experience as a teenager, he strapped the skis on, let the lift drag him up a big hill, and gravity did a lot of the work getting him to the bottom again.<br></p><p>Phil is full-on smirking now. Dan thinks he preferred the non-smile. \u201cYou may have noticed that we don\u2019t have chairlifts up here. We\u2019ll be hiking to the slopes on foot. I\u2019ve put skins on the bottom of these to give us more grip, but we can take them off when we get there.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan tries not let the alarm show on his face. They\u2019re going to be walking up hills? In skis? \u201cAnd\u2026 I suppose once we ski down the slope we\u2019ll be having to\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWalk back up again? Yes. Unless you fancy setting up camp down there.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>An ill-timed image of the Brokeback Mountain tent attacks Dan so viciously it nearly knocks him sideways.\u00a0\u201cNo! No, no. Walking back up. Cool. Good thing I\u2019ve been practicing with those bloody hotel stairs, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan forces a laugh, but this time Phil\u2019s face remains unmoved. Clearly it\u2019s only Dan\u2019s unintentional idiocy that can procure a genuine smile from him then, right.\u00a0</p><p>Phil looks to the sky briefly, seeming to assess something in the heavens themselves, and asks, \u201cready to go, then?\u201d<br></p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for Dan\u2019s reply. He picks up his ski poles, then turns and begins sort of slide-walking away from the hotel, in seemingly no particular direction. There\u2019s a large thicket of trees ahead of him, but then there are thickets of trees in a few other directions too. Nevertheless, Dan has no choice but to trust this man\u2019s sense of direction, so attempts to move after him; to his horror, his legs immediately split apart in a move he is certainly not flexible enough to achieve. He manages to stab his ski poles into the earth and rectify himself before pulling anything, but in doing so he flails, and almost falls. Luckily, he\u2019s gotten back into a reasonably dignified standing position by the time Phil turns to him, wondering what the hold up is.<br></p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan says, making a valiant attempt to copy Phil\u2019s movements exactly as he inches forwards again. It works, sort of, though he doesn\u2019t do it anywhere near as gracefully as Phil seems to be able to. When he gets to Phil, he shrugs, like he\u2019s totally fine. \u201cJust\u2026 admiring the view,\u201d he explains. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It takes over thirty gruelling minutes to cross the plains of the mountain in pursuit of a supposedly safe ski-area, but eventually they reach an abrupt dip, where the mountain begins its gradual slope downward. This close to the edge of the mountain, the view is breathtaking. Dan can\u2019t focus on it, however, because his thighs ache, the moisture in his lungs has turned to ice and is freezing him from the inside out, and for the last twenty minutes, Phil Novokoric has been unhelpfully telling him everything he\u2019s doing wrong with the stupid\u00a0\u2018telemark\u2019 skis.<br></p><p>\u201cIs this where we do some actual skiing then?\u201d Dan asks crossly, jamming his poles into the snow.<br></p><p>He\u2019s so glad to get to a point where he actually knows what he\u2019s doing that he\u2019s already shuffling up to the edge of the slope, more than ready to get this over with. He\u2019s so keen, in fact, that he\u2019s only just about saved from teetering over the edge and hurtling down in an enormous cartoon-style snowball, by a far more sensible Phil. He grabs Dan by the hood of his coat before he can topple to his untimely death.<br></p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d he exclaims as he yanks Dan backwards. Yet again, the irritating warning is at least ten seconds too late. Dan has already been an idiot; unless Phil expects him to travel back in time to ten seconds ago, and take heed of Phil\u2019s caution. Phil pulls him so sharply that Dan jolts backwards, skis slotting between Phil\u2019s as his back crashes against his chest. His heart pounds incessantly. Or maybe that\u2019s Phil\u2019s heart. \u201cAre you some kind of moron?\u201d Phil asks, then pauses, like he\u2019s actually waiting for an answer. \u201cJust\u00a0<i>wait\u00a0</i>a minute, we\u2019ve got to take our skins off. Then\u00a0<i>I\u2019ll</i>\u00a0lead the way.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRemind me why I agreed to this,\u201d Dan mutters, carefully sliding away from Phil whilst trying not to accidentally fall down the slope.\u00a0</p><p>Sulkily, he stands to the side and watches as Phil removes one ski, and peels a thin black strip from the underside, then does the same to the other. Dan copies his action in silence, though he has no idea why on earth this is necessary. Phil monitors Dan wordlessly, but thankfully makes no judgemental comments.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asks once Dan has his de-skinned skis back on.\u00a0</p><p>Dan shoves the bunched up skins into his jacket pocket.\u00a0<i>No</i>. \u201cYep.\u201d<br></p><p>And then, with enviable ease, Phil pushes himself over the edge of the slope, and begins drifting downwards, swaying gracefully to and fro as he descends. Somewhat alarmed by how quickly that just happened, Dan swallows his nerves and shoots after him. It\u2019s\u00a0<i>terrifying</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Dan hasn\u2019t experienced this level of self-propelled velocity for years, let alone the searing chill that whips his cheeks, or the sensation of being at once in control of his own speed, and simultaneously ill-equipped to do so. He grips his ski poles tightly, attempting to copy Phil\u2019s swooping motions up ahead, leaning left and right as much as he dares in order to slow his pace. The slope had not looked particularly steep from the top, but Dan should probably have been more concerned about the amount of debris on the path that he has to keep swerving to avoid. Annoyingly, Phil was completely right in insisting he went first, as otherwise Dan would have crashed several times into boulders and tree stumps and icy patches.<br></p><p>It can\u2019t last particularly long, but it seems to Dan that he\u2019s skiing, teeth gritted, eyes frozen open, for hours. Eventually however, the slope evens out, and flattens enough that they slow to a stop. Somewhere in the recesses of Dan\u2019s brain, he scrounges up his knowledge of how to point the tips of his skis together to halt himself. Phil does some kind of impressive, sudden, 90 degree turning move, but he doesn\u2019t outright laugh at Dan\u2019s less stylish method, thankfully.</p><p>Dan is just about to collapse to the floor and weep, relieved he survived that and didn\u2019t so much as fall over once, when Phil pulls off his sunglasses, and gives Dan the widest, most brilliant grin. His teeth are as white as the snow surrounding them. Seeing such animation on his usually sullen features is so unexpected that Dan swears his heart literally skips a beat, though that might be on account of all the adrenaline from plummeting down the side of a mountain. Dan removes his own sunglasses, somewhat shakily, and aims a tentative smile back at him.<br></p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Phil says, eyes bright and crystalline in the light. \u201cIf you did some fitness training, you might be halfway decent.\u201d<br></p><p>The smile wipes itself away again. \u201cThanks,\u201d Dan mutters.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d Phil asks, elbow resting on one of his upright ski poles. He\u2019s a tiny bit breathless, which gives his words a whisperish quality. In another setting that wasn\u2019t as eerily silent, it might be difficult to hear him. \u201cFun, right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on that,\u201d Dan replies, heart still pounding at double his normal rate.<br></p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cThis is probably the gentlest path I\u2019ve found.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFound?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t be certain of course, but I doubt anyone else has ever skied up here.\u201d He grins again, jarring and hypnotic. \u201cI\u2019m the Columbus of the Alps.\u201d<br></p><p>This seems highly unlikely. Dan\u2019s no expert in mountaineering, but surely other adventurers have come up and explored the mountain before now. Phil being the first one to ever scope out reasonably skiable pathways seems incredibly dangerous, and probably illegal.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you, like, allowed?\u201d<br></p><p>Phil shrugs, slipping his shades back on. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna stop me?\u201d<br></p><p>It\u2019s this offhanded, entitled flippancy that Dan detests about the rich. He chooses not to respond to such an irritating question, and instead asks, \u201cso, what now?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cClimb back up,\u201d Phil says, already pulling his skins from his pocket. \u201cUnless you wanna check out one of the trickier slopes?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Dan says tightly.<br></p><p>Phil chuckles again. \u201cAlright then, skins on, Howell.\u201d<br></p><p>*<br></p><p>In hindsight, Dan should really have given more thought to the idea of climbing back up the hill they\u2019d just skied down, in skis. To say it was difficult would have been generous. By the time they reach the top (it shouldn\u2019t go unmentioned that Phil was much, much quicker than Dan at getting back up, and then shouted helpful suggestions of how he should turn his heels, or dig his skis in to the snow from the summit) Dan is so exhausted he never wants to lift another limb in his life, let alone slide down a hill just to climb it yet again. Phil is raring to go, of course, but Dan simply unfastens his skis and falls back onto his bum, unconcerned that the snow immediately begins seeping into the seat of his trousers, and gestures for the other man to go on without him.<br></p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Phil says, snickering, and pushes over the edge.<br></p><p>From his position, Dan is able to watch as Phil airily glides down. It\u2019s obvious, from this vantage point, that skiing gives Phil an air of freedom that he lacks in everyday life. His limbs are loosened of their usual tension, and even from a distance Dan can see that he is calm and happy. As Phil re-climbs the slope, Dan peels off the weird skins from the underside of his skis again and studies them for a bit, then stuffs them into his pocket, deciding they\u2019re just flaps of fabric you could make in five seconds, probably sold in sports shops at an absurd cost. He then attempts to browse the internet on his phone, though given that they\u2019re currently in the middle of absolutely nowhere, this does not go well. He quickly abandons any attempt to check his Facebook feed, and plays Crossy Road until a shadow washes over him. He looks up just as Phil slumps down beside him, panting.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence on me,\u201d Phil says between breaths. \u201cUsually I do this about twenty times, up and down. On the steeper slopes, too.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan snorts. \u201cExcuse me, but screw that. Nobody told me there\u2019d be climbing involved. Give me a terrifying ski lift any day.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnywhere there\u2019s a ski lift there\u2019s a hundred tourists crammed on, waiting to dawdle in front of you on the slope on the way down.\u201d<br></p><p>Again, Dan doesn\u2019t remember this being particularly true from his previous skiing experience. On the red and black runs, there were only a handful of other people to avoid. He can see nothing wrong with something being made safe by professionals. Deciding it\u2019s probably wise to keep this thought to himself in order to keep the peace, Dan instead digs the flask of coffee out of his pocket, pulls both the plastic cups off the top, and hands one to Phil.<br></p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve skied in a lot of places, then?\u201d he asks.<br></p><p>Phil is looking down at the cup like Dan just pulled it out of his rear end. \u201cEr\u2026 yeah. Quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>Dan ignores the curious expression being aimed at him, and just focuses on pouring out the coffee. He\u2019d remembered at the last minute to bring sugar for Phil, so he digs out the packets from his pocket, and presses them into Phil\u2019s free hand along with a wooden stirrer.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Dan says.\u00a0\u201cWhere abouts?\u201d<br></p><p>For a moment, Phil says nothing. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s forgotten how to move, or speak. Dan just waits, the warmth of the coffee cup in his hands starting to spread through his gloved fingers, melting the stiffness. He sips his own coffee until Phil regains composure and pours the sugar in.<br></p><p>\u201cUh, lots of places. My family used to go every year at Christmas.\u201d He stirs the coffee slowly, gazing out at the thick, snow-frosted trees lining the slope. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Andorra, Saalbach Chamonix\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>This peaks Dan\u2019s attention. \u201cChamonix? I\u2019ve been there.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes go round. \u201cOh my God\u2026 I knew I recognised you.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan\u2019s stomach drops. \u201cW-what?\u201d Surely this cannot be happening.</p><p>\u201cThe New Year\u2019s Eve party\u2026\u201d he gushes, placing a hand on Dan\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, abort, abort, abort</i>. \u201cThere was karaoke\u2026 we were dragged on stage to sing a duet\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>For a split second, Dan\u2019s mind is hurtling in circles as he tries to remember any such awful event, and then he notes the twitch of Phil\u2019s mouth, the glimmer of obvious teasing lurking in his expression. Right as Dan\u2019s about to grab a handful of snow and smash it into that obnoxious mocking face, Phil clutches his chest and belts out, \u201cthis is the\u00a0<i>start</i>\u00a0of something\u00a0<i>newww</i>!\u201d<br></p><p>Dan groans, eyes rolling so far backwards he can see the folds of his brain. \u201cAs\u00a0<i>if</i>\u00a0you\u2019re making an actual High School Musical reference right now.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one that got it,\u201d Phil points out, giggling softly.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so irritating,\u201d Dan mutters, sipping more coffee.<br></p><p>The snow has officially soaked all the way through his trousers, and his bum has gone entirely numb from the cold. If he has to sit here and listen to Phil\u2019s annoying, posh-boy teasing for a second longer, he\u2019s going to ski directly into a nearby tree.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you supposed to call your guests irritating?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan fights a smile, hiding his mouth in his cup. \u201cDepends how much they piss me off.\u201d<br></p><p>This makes Phil laugh; a sound Dan is sure he will never grow used to. \u201cAt least I have a dry bum right now. Your idea of appropriate ski attire is as shocking as your technique.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Dan says brightly, and stands up. He pretty much instantly regrets doing so as the cold water that\u2019s been soaking his bum for the last half hour trickles down the backs of his thighs. He chucks the remainder of his coffee into the snow, and pockets the cup along with the flask. \u201cBeing the official laughing stock of the slopes is not part of my job description. It\u2019s been a blast, Mr Novokoric, but I have a hotel to run, so if you\u2019ll excuse me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOoh, back to Mr Novokoric, is it?\u201d Phil asks, standing up as well. He drains the last of his own coffee, and gathers his ski poles. \u201cHang on then, let me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Dan says, swishing his ski pole at Phil as he tries to slide closer. \u201cI\u2019m clearly stopping you from throwing yourself down some more death-defying hills or whatever. I can get back to the hotel on my own just fine.\u201d<br></p><p>He shoves his feet back into the skis one by one, thankfully able to tighten them to his feet without help this time, and then awkwardly shuffles around to face the direction they came from. There\u2019s a bit of a hill ahead, but in comparison to the one he climbed up not long ago it looks tiny, so he slides towards it with determination.<br></p><p>\u201cDan, hold on,\u201d Phil says impatiently, still strapping himself back into his own skis. \u201cYou can\u2019t just-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m\u00a0<i>fine</i>,\u201d Dan says through gritted teeth. In truth however,\u00a0gaining any sort of momentum on this incline seems a lot harder than it had been previously. \u201cJust go do your thing.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s about halfway up the small hill, and he feels alarmingly unsteady. The skis seem to have a mind of their own, and keep threatening to slide out from under him. Dan just shoves his ski poles into the snow as hard as possible, using them to help drag him upwards.<br></p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil is calling from somewhere behind him. \u201cCan you stop being so pig-headed for a minute? You\u2019ve forgotten-\u201d<br></p><p>Dan cuts him off with an embarrassingly high-pitched yelp as his right ski slips sharply backwards, splitting his legs wishbone-style. With the help of his ski pole, he manages not to rip his own crotch in half, but the back of his right ski crosses over his left, and in trying to correct it, Dan falls backwards. His right ankle seems to not want to cooperate with the angle Dan is toppling, and twists beneath him; his boot still being attached to the ski, this hurts like a motherfucker.<br></p><p>\u201cShit! Ow, ow ow-\u201d<br></p><p>Pain, scorching and sudden, shoots up Dan\u2019s leg. His ankle is bent somehow beneath him, and it\u2019s agony. He only has mere seconds to revel in the pain however, as then hands are on the strap of his ski, scrambling to unattach him, and blissfully his ankle pops free.<br></p><p>\u201cI told you to wait for me!\u201d Phil shouts, though the sound is fuzzy and distant from the leftover cloud of pain hazing Dan\u2019s senses. \u201cYou forgot to put your skins back on, you idiot.\u201d Dan barely understands, too focused on his throbbing ankle. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes it bloody hurts!\u201d Dan snaps, clutching the ankle. \u201cWhat kind of idiotic question is that?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDan, I need to see how bad it is.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dan protests, but Phil is already picking at the knot of his laces, clearly not listening.<br></p><p>As he reluctantly surrenders to Phil\u2019s insistence on acting the hero, Dan realises for the first time just how\u2026 close he is. At this level of proximity, it\u2019s possible to detect notes of the shampoo Phil uses dancing on the thin, icy breeze. Coconut, possibly. Or watermelon? In the distraction of trying to place the smell, Dan doesn\u2019t realise what\u2019s happening until his laces are untied, and Phil begins carefully pulling off his boot. He removes his gloves, and blows quickly on his hands before reaching out and rolling down Dan\u2019s thick sock. Something about this whole scenario is so intimate that Dan wants to squirm. Presumably, he\u2019d only blown on his fingers to warm them - to ease Dan\u2019s discomfort. Dan wouldn\u2019t expect such consideration from his own mother, let alone this dick-brain. To stifle his drumming heart, Dan bites down on his lip, and turns his face away.<br></p><p>\u201cLooks swollen,\u201d Phil mutters as he pulls the sock down. Gently, he presses the pads of his fingers to the puffed, pink skin around Dan\u2019s ankle. It doesn\u2019t hurt any more than the existing pain, but Dan twitches nonetheless, and Phil\u2019s blisteringly blue eyes flick up to his.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel broken. Do you think you could stand on it?\u201d</p><p>Experimentally, Dan tries wiggling his toes. It\u2019s unpleasant, sure, but not completely unbearable. \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he says, attempting bravery.<br></p><p>Phil begins rolling his sock back up. \u201cGood choice,\u201d he says, reaching for the boot. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me up here, so unless you fancy spending the night in minus six degrees under the stars, I\u2019d advise hopping if you can. It\u2019ll start getting dark in a few hours.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGee, thanks for the sympathy,\u201d Dan snorts, batting Phil\u2019s hands away to re-tie his laces.<br></p><p>Phil waits, saying nothing, and when Dan is done, he holds out his hand. For a moment Dan just stares at it. He\u2019s seconds away from slipping his own hand into it, when Phil says, \u201cyour skins? I\u2019ll put them back on for you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Dan says, hoping Phil doesn\u2019t notice his odd behaviour. He has no clue what the fuck this mountain air is doing to him recently. He digs in his pocket and pulls out the skins, then shoves them into Phil\u2019s hand.\u00a0\u201cCheers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much more\u2026 bony than you look,\u201d Phil huffs.\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re about halfway through the hideous journey back, as far as Dan can tell. Approximately three minutes in, Dan had realised that attempting to walk on his own, wearing the damn \u2018telemark\u2019 skis, was not an option.</p><p>\u201cI apologise sincerely for having bones,\u201d Dan replies scornfully. In truth, he feels like a pile of boneless goo, so it\u2019s surprising that Phil seems to think he\u2019s the opposite. His arm is wound around Phil\u2019s shoulders, allowing Dan to lean a great deal of his weight onto the other man. He\u2019s got one ski on, the other is in his right hand. Phil is carrying all four ski poles, tucked under his arm.\u00a0<br></p><p>They\u2019ve been moving at a torturously slow pace, so the sun is already dipping towards the horizon at their backs. Even in the space of a few hours, Dan can feel the drop in temperature, and it wasn\u2019t exactly warm before. They were lucky, in a way, that Dan\u2019s little accident had happened whilst there was still a lot of light left. He leans closer into Phil\u2019s body heat, hoping the other man doesn\u2019t notice.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d<br></p><p>Crap. \u201cUm, a bit.\u201d<br></p><p>They hobble further on in silence. Dan wonders what the purpose of Phil\u2019s question might have been, as now he seems to be deliberating something silently. Please, God, don\u2019t say that Phil Novokoric is about to hand over his snow jacket to invalid-Dan so he can tell the story of his chivalry to some doe-eyed journalist months from now.\u00a0</p><p>In a way, Dan is almost glad when Phil, predictably, says, \u201canother reason to invest in some proper thermals. Might have been an idea, considering you\u2019re living up a snowy mountain.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Dan says through gritted teeth. Finally, the sight of the hotel crests the horizon, some way off still, but at least within view. \u201cThank the fucking Lord,\u201d he mutters under his breath.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou could get on my back for the last bit, if you like,\u201d Phil suggests, tone lilting into something like a tease.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alright, thanks,\u201d Dan replies tersely. He sincerely wishes he could extricate himself from this infuriating human and sprint the rest of the way back, but unfortunately he thinks he might snap his own ankle off, brittle as it is now from the cold. \u201cCan we just focus on getting to the hotel without any further injuries, please?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, then effortlessly hitches Dan\u2019s arm a little higher across his shoulders, taking on significantly more of his weight. For a reason Dan refuses to analyse, this action makes his stomach flip multiple times, but he has no time to dwell on the how\u2019s or why\u2019s, because Phil has doubled the pace now, near-dragging Dan along.<br></p><p>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\">Ao3 Link</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a></p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>For a moment, no words will come. The blood in Dan&rsquo;s wrist pulses in odd, shifting patterns beneath the skin. He swallows, caught on the edge of a gelid blue stare. &ldquo;I&hellip; can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>ski</i>?&rdquo; Phil asks, his sneer an anchor that yanks Dan back down from the astral plane into which Phil&rsquo;s touch had propelled him.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I&nbsp;<i>can</i>&nbsp;ski,&rdquo; he retorts, bristling. He chooses not to mention that he hasn&rsquo;t skied since he was fourteen, when his family went to Chamonix for a week, and his mum and dad complained the entire time that it was too cold. At a&nbsp;<i>ski lodge</i>. &ldquo;But I have to&hellip; y&rsquo;know, work. Hotel stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Mesmerised by the slight twitch of the corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth, which still doesn&rsquo;t quite count as a smile, Dan&rsquo;s hostile stance falters, then wanes. Like it&rsquo;s a perfume wafting from Phil&rsquo;s skin through the air between them, in the next second Dan smells the imminence of his own surrender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Phil says, his voice quiet, like it&rsquo;s just for Dan. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter that nobody else could have heard him anyway. &ldquo;What else are you gonna do all day? Cook lunch for the hotel ghosts? Sit at reception and pretend you&rsquo;re not playing on your phone?&rdquo;</p><p>A spurt of blood shoots into Dan&rsquo;s cheeks; he&rsquo;d thought he was so stealthy, hiding his phone under the desk as he attempted to load a single meme at a time on Tumblr mobile, using tenuous 3G.</p><p>&ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t have any skis,&rdquo; Dan says lamely.</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky for you that my old ones were repaired by the elusive hotel elf, then,&rdquo; Phil quips, already stepping away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you by the front door, shall I?&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s gone before Dan can muster up a further refusal. He stands gormless in the middle of the kitchen, gazing around at the pristine surfaces. If only he&rsquo;d resisted the urge to clean everything already, then he could at least have the excuse of needing to scrub the day away. Perhaps he could quickly throw open all the cupboard doors, ransack the fridge and hurl ingredients and coffee everywhere, feigning a wolf had snuck in somehow, or a snow leopard.&nbsp;</p><p>An image flashes into Dan&rsquo;s mind, of Mona&rsquo;s deepening frown as Phil explained to her that not only did Dan let some wild animal break in and contaminate the kitchen, but that he also refused to grant the one request of the only guest. He shudders, closing the door on that image before it can develop. Mona is already far too close to a stark realisation of Dan&rsquo;s utter hopelessness; despite the words of any fortune-telling crows, a voice lingers at the back of Dan&rsquo;s mind, assuring him that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he slips up and disappoints everyone. His only hope is to stall that inevitability for as long as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus Phil is, annoyingly, right. There is nothing else for Dan to do today; he and Mona did a deep clean of the whole hotel before she left, and the place is spotless. With no guests to look after, and a low chance of anyone phoning given that the Swiss news helpfully predicted a terrifying blizzard, Dan really is at a loose end.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>It takes about two minutes of dithering in the kitchen before he has to admit defeat. Dan lets out a dreaded sigh, pushing all the air from his lungs, and then goes to wash up the two mugs he&rsquo;s still holding. As he&rsquo;s scrubbing the coffee stains, he decides that caffeine is the only acceptable (or available) drug he can utilise to get through whatever lies in store, so he places the mugs on the drying rack, and rinses out a thermos flask he finds, along with Louise&rsquo;s percolator. He makes the coffee very strong, pours it into the flask, then thinks for a moment, and adds a dollop of soya milk.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>As soon as he opens his chest of drawers, Dan is struck once again by how ill-prepared he is for a sudden, impulsive foray into the snowy wilderness. As he lacks proper &lsquo;ski-wear&rsquo; - whatever that might be - Dan Instead chooses to go for layers. A clingy t-shirt that barely fit him when he was sixteen, then a baggier, long-sleeved t-shirt. He covers these with a shapeless grey jumper, then a black jacket, and then, finally his warmest coat. He adds thick socks, a hat, boots, sunglasses, gloves and a scarf. By the time he feels he&rsquo;s ready, his arms stick out stiffly from his sides, but he figures that a little loss of movement is a fair price to pay for not getting frostbite.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He slots the flask into one of the deep pockets of his coat, and tries not to think too hard about what he&rsquo;s about to do. Or with whom. He deliberately takes his time getting down to the lobby in order to prolong the inevitable, and also because he likes the idea of the Fresh Prince of the Alps having to wait for him. Phil&nbsp;lowers his phone as Dan approaches, pushing off from where he&rsquo;s leant against the wall. It takes a moment for him to drink in the sight of Dan, and then his eyebrows shoot up, and he seems to swallow something suspiciously close to a laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Err, think you&rsquo;ll be warm enough?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan rolls his eyes. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly pack for extreme sports.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil just makes a &lsquo;hmm&rsquo; noise, turning to the collection of skis and poles leaning against the wall. &ldquo;Not sure cross-country skiing could be classed as an extreme sport, but you do y- er, suit yourself.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>If Dan tries to reply, he&rsquo;ll probably swear, so he clamps his mouth shut, and sticks an arm out to grab for the the red skis. Phil snatches them up first.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear these,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You take the new ones.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t look at Dan, just pushes the shiny new skis into his hands. Bewildered, Dan stares at his warped reflection in the electric blue varnish.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It takes a minute for Phil to respond; he&rsquo;s tugging at the repaired bracket on the red ski, seemingly to test its durability. This alone is enough to make Dan want to slap it out of his hands. Then, he turns to Dan, that vague almost-smile still tucked beneath his smug expression.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t tested the new ones out yet,&rdquo; he says with a shrug. &ldquo;Reckon it&rsquo;d be better for my caddy to fall on his face than me, right?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan splutters, outraged. &ldquo;<i>Caddy?</i>&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Grab those ski poles for us, would you?&rdquo; Phil asks, a spritz of amusement perfuming his words.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan might be intrigued by the lightness of his tone if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact he were quietly steaming inside his many layers. The heating in this place does not fuck about. Worried he&rsquo;ll boil alive unless they get outside soon, Dan chooses to just do as he&rsquo;s asked. If Phil insists on calling him a caddy again, at least Dan will have four long weapons to wield.&nbsp;Dan gathers the four poles up in his arms as best he can, along with his own skis; on the verge of dropping everything, he opts for speed, and scurries after Phil out of the front door.</p><p>&ldquo;If you expect me to haul all of this up some peak or other-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan can&rsquo;t see, as he&rsquo;s got a number of pointed objects obscuring his view, so he doesn&rsquo;t realise that Phil has stopped directly in front of him, a few paces beyond the door. Dan bumps straight into him, and instantly everything he&rsquo;s holding drops to the ground. When he looks up, Phil is aiming an exasperated gaze down at the pile of poles and skis, as if he&rsquo;s already regretting inviting Dan along.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t expect you to actually be my pack mule. We&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;<i>wear</i>&nbsp;our skis,&rdquo; Phil explains slowly, like he&rsquo;s talking to a child.<br /></p><p>He&rsquo;s already got his skis laid neatly out in front of him - two bright red parallel lines striking through the snow. As Dan watches confusedly, Phil pushes the tip of his right boot into one of the skis. Dan&rsquo;s stomach squeezes with discomfort; he&rsquo;d been correct before, when repairing the skis. The fastenings are not the same as he&rsquo;s used to.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Erm,&rdquo; Dan says, moving his attention to one of his own skis, laying at an angle in the snow. It has the same unfamiliar fastening, much to his dismay.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Mind racing to figure out every option available to him that doesn&rsquo;t involve swallowing his pride and asking Phil for help, Dan moves to inspect the contraption. As if he&rsquo;s sensed Dan&rsquo;s incompetence, Phil drops into a crouch anyway, and reaches for Dan&rsquo;s boot. Instinctively, Dan jerks his foot away. Phil lifts his head to look at Dan. Viewing him from this angle is strange. From this perspective, he seems hunched, small, insignificant. He has none of his Lordly airs about him, hunched down in the snow near Dan&rsquo;s feet. Phil doesn&rsquo;t say anything, he just waits, hand calmly outstretched towards Dan&rsquo;s boot.&nbsp;Wordlessly, Dan moves his foot back into Phil&rsquo;s reach, and watches as Phil carefully rights the ski, then pulls his foot towards it. He fits the toe of Dan&rsquo;s boot into the unusual strap.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re telemark skis,&rdquo; Phil says, tightening the strap around the ball of Dan&rsquo;s foot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re more used to Alpine skis? They&rsquo;re the ones with the strap at the back as well.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan bristles again at the condescending tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m familiar with both,&rdquo; he says, because he&rsquo;s a stubborn moron. Phil says nothing, but that near-smile returns as he reaches for Dan&rsquo;s other foot; Dan wobbles slightly as Phil guides it into the left ski. &ldquo;But, uh, it&rsquo;s been a while. So&hellip; remind me again of the difference between, er, telemark and&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alpine,&rdquo; Phil supplies, standing up. He holds Dan&rsquo;s gaze for a moment, and then laughs, short and quiet, but just enough for Dan to catch a glimpse of two rows of pearl-white teeth, with a flash of pink tongue caught between them. It&rsquo;s the most Dan&rsquo;s seen him smile yet, though he&rsquo;s obviously laughing&nbsp;<i>at</i>&nbsp;Dan which isn&rsquo;t ideal. &ldquo;Telemark skis are designed so that you can wear them for both hiking and skiing. You can move your ankle in them, see?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He demonstrates, twisting his un-strapped heel to and fro. Dan tries to do the same, and almost falls over. &ldquo;Why do we need to use our ankles, exactly?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t remember skiing requiring a lot of joint movement. From what he can recall of his brief experience as a teenager, he strapped the skis on, let the lift drag him up a big hill, and gravity did a lot of the work getting him to the bottom again.<br /></p><p>Phil is full-on smirking now. Dan thinks he preferred the non-smile. &ldquo;You may have noticed that we don&rsquo;t have chairlifts up here. We&rsquo;ll be hiking to the slopes on foot. I&rsquo;ve put skins on the bottom of these to give us more grip, but we can take them off when we get there.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan tries not let the alarm show on his face. They&rsquo;re going to be walking up hills? In skis? &ldquo;And&hellip; I suppose once we ski down the slope we&rsquo;ll be having to&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Walk back up again? Yes. Unless you fancy setting up camp down there.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>An ill-timed image of the Brokeback Mountain tent attacks Dan so viciously it nearly knocks him sideways.&nbsp;&ldquo;No! No, no. Walking back up. Cool. Good thing I&rsquo;ve been practicing with those bloody hotel stairs, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan forces a laugh, but this time Phil&rsquo;s face remains unmoved. Clearly it&rsquo;s only Dan&rsquo;s unintentional idiocy that can procure a genuine smile from him then, right.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil looks to the sky briefly, seeming to assess something in the heavens themselves, and asks, &ldquo;ready to go, then?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t wait for Dan&rsquo;s reply. He picks up his ski poles, then turns and begins sort of slide-walking away from the hotel, in seemingly no particular direction. There&rsquo;s a large thicket of trees ahead of him, but then there are thickets of trees in a few other directions too. Nevertheless, Dan has no choice but to trust this man&rsquo;s sense of direction, so attempts to move after him; to his horror, his legs immediately split apart in a move he is certainly not flexible enough to achieve. He manages to stab his ski poles into the earth and rectify himself before pulling anything, but in doing so he flails, and almost falls. Luckily, he&rsquo;s gotten back into a reasonably dignified standing position by the time Phil turns to him, wondering what the hold up is.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Dan says, making a valiant attempt to copy Phil&rsquo;s movements exactly as he inches forwards again. It works, sort of, though he doesn&rsquo;t do it anywhere near as gracefully as Phil seems to be able to. When he gets to Phil, he shrugs, like he&rsquo;s totally fine. &ldquo;Just&hellip; admiring the view,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>It takes over thirty gruelling minutes to cross the plains of the mountain in pursuit of a supposedly safe ski-area, but eventually they reach an abrupt dip, where the mountain begins its gradual slope downward. This close to the edge of the mountain, the view is breathtaking. Dan can&rsquo;t focus on it, however, because his thighs ache, the moisture in his lungs has turned to ice and is freezing him from the inside out, and for the last twenty minutes, Phil Novokoric has been unhelpfully telling him everything he&rsquo;s doing wrong with the stupid&nbsp;&lsquo;telemark&rsquo; skis.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this where we do some actual skiing then?&rdquo; Dan asks crossly, jamming his poles into the snow.<br /></p><p>He&rsquo;s so glad to get to a point where he actually knows what he&rsquo;s doing that he&rsquo;s already shuffling up to the edge of the slope, more than ready to get this over with. He&rsquo;s so keen, in fact, that he&rsquo;s only just about saved from teetering over the edge and hurtling down in an enormous cartoon-style snowball, by a far more sensible Phil. He grabs Dan by the hood of his coat before he can topple to his untimely death.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; he exclaims as he yanks Dan backwards. Yet again, the irritating warning is at least ten seconds too late. Dan has already been an idiot; unless Phil expects him to travel back in time to ten seconds ago, and take heed of Phil&rsquo;s caution. Phil pulls him so sharply that Dan jolts backwards, skis slotting between Phil&rsquo;s as his back crashes against his chest. His heart pounds incessantly. Or maybe that&rsquo;s Phil&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Are you some kind of moron?&rdquo; Phil asks, then pauses, like he&rsquo;s actually waiting for an answer. &ldquo;Just&nbsp;<i>wait&nbsp;</i>a minute, we&rsquo;ve got to take our skins off. Then&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;lead the way.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Remind me why I agreed to this,&rdquo; Dan mutters, carefully sliding away from Phil whilst trying not to accidentally fall down the slope.&nbsp;</p><p>Sulkily, he stands to the side and watches as Phil removes one ski, and peels a thin black strip from the underside, then does the same to the other. Dan copies his action in silence, though he has no idea why on earth this is necessary. Phil monitors Dan wordlessly, but thankfully makes no judgemental comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asks once Dan has his de-skinned skis back on.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan shoves the bunched up skins into his jacket pocket.&nbsp;<i>No</i>. &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>And then, with enviable ease, Phil pushes himself over the edge of the slope, and begins drifting downwards, swaying gracefully to and fro as he descends. Somewhat alarmed by how quickly that just happened, Dan swallows his nerves and shoots after him. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>terrifying</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan hasn&rsquo;t experienced this level of self-propelled velocity for years, let alone the searing chill that whips his cheeks, or the sensation of being at once in control of his own speed, and simultaneously ill-equipped to do so. He grips his ski poles tightly, attempting to copy Phil&rsquo;s swooping motions up ahead, leaning left and right as much as he dares in order to slow his pace. The slope had not looked particularly steep from the top, but Dan should probably have been more concerned about the amount of debris on the path that he has to keep swerving to avoid. Annoyingly, Phil was completely right in insisting he went first, as otherwise Dan would have crashed several times into boulders and tree stumps and icy patches.<br /></p><p>It can&rsquo;t last particularly long, but it seems to Dan that he&rsquo;s skiing, teeth gritted, eyes frozen open, for hours. Eventually however, the slope evens out, and flattens enough that they slow to a stop. Somewhere in the recesses of Dan&rsquo;s brain, he scrounges up his knowledge of how to point the tips of his skis together to halt himself. Phil does some kind of impressive, sudden, 90 degree turning move, but he doesn&rsquo;t outright laugh at Dan&rsquo;s less stylish method, thankfully.</p><p>Dan is just about to collapse to the floor and weep, relieved he survived that and didn&rsquo;t so much as fall over once, when Phil pulls off his sunglasses, and gives Dan the widest, most brilliant grin. His teeth are as white as the snow surrounding them. Seeing such animation on his usually sullen features is so unexpected that Dan swears his heart literally skips a beat, though that might be on account of all the adrenaline from plummeting down the side of a mountain. Dan removes his own sunglasses, somewhat shakily, and aims a tentative smile back at him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; Phil says, eyes bright and crystalline in the light. &ldquo;If you did some fitness training, you might be halfway decent.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The smile wipes itself away again. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dan mutters.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What did you think?&rdquo; Phil asks, elbow resting on one of his upright ski poles. He&rsquo;s a tiny bit breathless, which gives his words a whisperish quality. In another setting that wasn&rsquo;t as eerily silent, it might be difficult to hear him. &ldquo;Fun, right?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back to you on that,&rdquo; Dan replies, heart still pounding at double his normal rate.<br /></p><p>Phil chuckles. &ldquo;This is probably the gentlest path I&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Found?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I can&rsquo;t be certain of course, but I doubt anyone else has ever skied up here.&rdquo; He grins again, jarring and hypnotic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Columbus of the Alps.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>This seems highly unlikely. Dan&rsquo;s no expert in mountaineering, but surely other adventurers have come up and explored the mountain before now. Phil being the first one to ever scope out reasonably skiable pathways seems incredibly dangerous, and probably illegal.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you, like, allowed?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil shrugs, slipping his shades back on. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gonna stop me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s this offhanded, entitled flippancy that Dan detests about the rich. He chooses not to respond to such an irritating question, and instead asks, &ldquo;so, what now?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Climb back up,&rdquo; Phil says, already pulling his skins from his pocket. &ldquo;Unless you wanna check out one of the trickier slopes?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; Dan says tightly.<br /></p><p>Phil chuckles again. &ldquo;Alright then, skins on, Howell.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>*<br /></p><p>In hindsight, Dan should really have given more thought to the idea of climbing back up the hill they&rsquo;d just skied down, in skis. To say it was difficult would have been generous. By the time they reach the top (it shouldn&rsquo;t go unmentioned that Phil was much, much quicker than Dan at getting back up, and then shouted helpful suggestions of how he should turn his heels, or dig his skis in to the snow from the summit) Dan is so exhausted he never wants to lift another limb in his life, let alone slide down a hill just to climb it yet again. Phil is raring to go, of course, but Dan simply unfastens his skis and falls back onto his bum, unconcerned that the snow immediately begins seeping into the seat of his trousers, and gestures for the other man to go on without him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; Phil says, snickering, and pushes over the edge.<br /></p><p>From his position, Dan is able to watch as Phil airily glides down. It&rsquo;s obvious, from this vantage point, that skiing gives Phil an air of freedom that he lacks in everyday life. His limbs are loosened of their usual tension, and even from a distance Dan can see that he is calm and happy. As Phil re-climbs the slope, Dan peels off the weird skins from the underside of his skis again and studies them for a bit, then stuffs them into his pocket, deciding they&rsquo;re just flaps of fabric you could make in five seconds, probably sold in sports shops at an absurd cost. He then attempts to browse the internet on his phone, though given that they&rsquo;re currently in the middle of absolutely nowhere, this does not go well. He quickly abandons any attempt to check his Facebook feed, and plays Crossy Road until a shadow washes over him. He looks up just as Phil slumps down beside him, panting.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad influence on me,&rdquo; Phil says between breaths. &ldquo;Usually I do this about twenty times, up and down. On the steeper slopes, too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan snorts. &ldquo;Excuse me, but screw that. Nobody told me there&rsquo;d be climbing involved. Give me a terrifying ski lift any day.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anywhere there&rsquo;s a ski lift there&rsquo;s a hundred tourists crammed on, waiting to dawdle in front of you on the slope on the way down.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Again, Dan doesn&rsquo;t remember this being particularly true from his previous skiing experience. On the red and black runs, there were only a handful of other people to avoid. He can see nothing wrong with something being made safe by professionals. Deciding it&rsquo;s probably wise to keep this thought to himself in order to keep the peace, Dan instead digs the flask of coffee out of his pocket, pulls both the plastic cups off the top, and hands one to Phil.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve skied in a lot of places, then?&rdquo; he asks.<br /></p><p>Phil is looking down at the cup like Dan just pulled it out of his rear end. &ldquo;Er&hellip; yeah. Quite a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan ignores the curious expression being aimed at him, and just focuses on pouring out the coffee. He&rsquo;d remembered at the last minute to bring sugar for Phil, so he digs out the packets from his pocket, and presses them into Phil&rsquo;s free hand along with a wooden stirrer.</p><p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; Dan says.&nbsp;&ldquo;Where abouts?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>For a moment, Phil says nothing. It&rsquo;s as though he&rsquo;s forgotten how to move, or speak. Dan just waits, the warmth of the coffee cup in his hands starting to spread through his gloved fingers, melting the stiffness. He sips his own coffee until Phil regains composure and pours the sugar in.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, lots of places. My family used to go every year at Christmas.&rdquo; He stirs the coffee slowly, gazing out at the thick, snow-frosted trees lining the slope. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Andorra, Saalbach Chamonix&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>This peaks Dan&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;Chamonix? I&rsquo;ve been there.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes go round. &ldquo;Oh my God&hellip; I knew I recognised you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan&rsquo;s stomach drops. &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; Surely this cannot be happening.</p><p>&ldquo;The New Year&rsquo;s Eve party&hellip;&rdquo; he gushes, placing a hand on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp;<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, abort, abort, abort</i>. &ldquo;There was karaoke&hellip; we were dragged on stage to sing a duet&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>For a split second, Dan&rsquo;s mind is hurtling in circles as he tries to remember any such awful event, and then he notes the twitch of Phil&rsquo;s mouth, the glimmer of obvious teasing lurking in his expression. Right as Dan&rsquo;s about to grab a handful of snow and smash it into that obnoxious mocking face, Phil clutches his chest and belts out, &ldquo;this is the&nbsp;<i>start</i>&nbsp;of something&nbsp;<i>newww</i>!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan groans, eyes rolling so far backwards he can see the folds of his brain. &ldquo;As&nbsp;<i>if</i>&nbsp;you&rsquo;re making an actual High School Musical reference right now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re the one that got it,&rdquo; Phil points out, giggling softly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so irritating,&rdquo; Dan mutters, sipping more coffee.<br /></p><p>The snow has officially soaked all the way through his trousers, and his bum has gone entirely numb from the cold. If he has to sit here and listen to Phil&rsquo;s annoying, posh-boy teasing for a second longer, he&rsquo;s going to ski directly into a nearby tree.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you supposed to call your guests irritating?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan fights a smile, hiding his mouth in his cup. &ldquo;Depends how much they piss me off.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>This makes Phil laugh; a sound Dan is sure he will never grow used to. &ldquo;At least I have a dry bum right now. Your idea of appropriate ski attire is as shocking as your technique.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; Dan says brightly, and stands up. He pretty much instantly regrets doing so as the cold water that&rsquo;s been soaking his bum for the last half hour trickles down the backs of his thighs. He chucks the remainder of his coffee into the snow, and pockets the cup along with the flask. &ldquo;Being the official laughing stock of the slopes is not part of my job description. It&rsquo;s been a blast, Mr Novokoric, but I have a hotel to run, so if you&rsquo;ll excuse me-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, back to Mr Novokoric, is it?&rdquo; Phil asks, standing up as well. He drains the last of his own coffee, and gathers his ski poles. &ldquo;Hang on then, let me-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Dan says, swishing his ski pole at Phil as he tries to slide closer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m clearly stopping you from throwing yourself down some more death-defying hills or whatever. I can get back to the hotel on my own just fine.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He shoves his feet back into the skis one by one, thankfully able to tighten them to his feet without help this time, and then awkwardly shuffles around to face the direction they came from. There&rsquo;s a bit of a hill ahead, but in comparison to the one he climbed up not long ago it looks tiny, so he slides towards it with determination.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dan, hold on,&rdquo; Phil says impatiently, still strapping himself back into his own skis. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<i>fine</i>,&rdquo; Dan says through gritted teeth. In truth however,&nbsp;gaining any sort of momentum on this incline seems a lot harder than it had been previously. &ldquo;Just go do your thing.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s about halfway up the small hill, and he feels alarmingly unsteady. The skis seem to have a mind of their own, and keep threatening to slide out from under him. Dan just shoves his ski poles into the snow as hard as possible, using them to help drag him upwards.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil is calling from somewhere behind him. &ldquo;Can you stop being so pig-headed for a minute? You&rsquo;ve forgotten-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan cuts him off with an embarrassingly high-pitched yelp as his right ski slips sharply backwards, splitting his legs wishbone-style. With the help of his ski pole, he manages not to rip his own crotch in half, but the back of his right ski crosses over his left, and in trying to correct it, Dan falls backwards. His right ankle seems to not want to cooperate with the angle Dan is toppling, and twists beneath him; his boot still being attached to the ski, this hurts like a motherfucker.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Shit! Ow, ow ow-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Pain, scorching and sudden, shoots up Dan&rsquo;s leg. His ankle is bent somehow beneath him, and it&rsquo;s agony. He only has mere seconds to revel in the pain however, as then hands are on the strap of his ski, scrambling to unattach him, and blissfully his ankle pops free.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I told you to wait for me!&rdquo; Phil shouts, though the sound is fuzzy and distant from the leftover cloud of pain hazing Dan&rsquo;s senses. &ldquo;You forgot to put your skins back on, you idiot.&rdquo; Dan barely understands, too focused on his throbbing ankle. &ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes it bloody hurts!&rdquo; Dan snaps, clutching the ankle. &ldquo;What kind of idiotic question is that?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I need to see how bad it is.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Dan protests, but Phil is already picking at the knot of his laces, clearly not listening.<br /></p><p>As he reluctantly surrenders to Phil&rsquo;s insistence on acting the hero, Dan realises for the first time just how&hellip; close he is. At this level of proximity, it&rsquo;s possible to detect notes of the shampoo Phil uses dancing on the thin, icy breeze. Coconut, possibly. Or watermelon? In the distraction of trying to place the smell, Dan doesn&rsquo;t realise what&rsquo;s happening until his laces are untied, and Phil begins carefully pulling off his boot. He removes his gloves, and blows quickly on his hands before reaching out and rolling down Dan&rsquo;s thick sock. Something about this whole scenario is so intimate that Dan wants to squirm. Presumably, he&rsquo;d only blown on his fingers to warm them - to ease Dan&rsquo;s discomfort. Dan wouldn&rsquo;t expect such consideration from his own mother, let alone this dick-brain. To stifle his drumming heart, Dan bites down on his lip, and turns his face away.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Looks swollen,&rdquo; Phil mutters as he pulls the sock down. Gently, he presses the pads of his fingers to the puffed, pink skin around Dan&rsquo;s ankle. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt any more than the existing pain, but Dan twitches nonetheless, and Phil&rsquo;s blisteringly blue eyes flick up to his.&nbsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t feel broken. Do you think you could stand on it?&rdquo;</p><p>Experimentally, Dan tries wiggling his toes. It&rsquo;s unpleasant, sure, but not completely unbearable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; he says, attempting bravery.<br /></p><p>Phil begins rolling his sock back up. &ldquo;Good choice,&rdquo; he says, reaching for the boot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just you and me up here, so unless you fancy spending the night in minus six degrees under the stars, I&rsquo;d advise hopping if you can. It&rsquo;ll start getting dark in a few hours.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gee, thanks for the sympathy,&rdquo; Dan snorts, batting Phil&rsquo;s hands away to re-tie his laces.<br /></p><p>Phil waits, saying nothing, and when Dan is done, he holds out his hand. For a moment Dan just stares at it. He&rsquo;s seconds away from slipping his own hand into it, when Phil says, &ldquo;your skins? I&rsquo;ll put them back on for you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right,&rdquo; Dan says, hoping Phil doesn&rsquo;t notice his odd behaviour. He has no clue what the fuck this mountain air is doing to him recently. He digs in his pocket and pulls out the skins, then shoves them into Phil&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;Cheers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much more&hellip; bony than you look,&rdquo; Phil huffs.&nbsp;</p><p>They&rsquo;re about halfway through the hideous journey back, as far as Dan can tell. Approximately three minutes in, Dan had realised that attempting to walk on his own, wearing the damn &lsquo;telemark&rsquo; skis, was not an option.</p><p>&ldquo;I apologise sincerely for having bones,&rdquo; Dan replies scornfully. In truth, he feels like a pile of boneless goo, so it&rsquo;s surprising that Phil seems to think he&rsquo;s the opposite. His arm is wound around Phil&rsquo;s shoulders, allowing Dan to lean a great deal of his weight onto the other man. He&rsquo;s got one ski on, the other is in his right hand. Phil is carrying all four ski poles, tucked under his arm.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>They&rsquo;ve been moving at a torturously slow pace, so the sun is already dipping towards the horizon at their backs. Even in the space of a few hours, Dan can feel the drop in temperature, and it wasn&rsquo;t exactly warm before. They were lucky, in a way, that Dan&rsquo;s little accident had happened whilst there was still a lot of light left. He leans closer into Phil&rsquo;s body heat, hoping the other man doesn&rsquo;t notice.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Crap. &ldquo;Um, a bit.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>They hobble further on in silence. Dan wonders what the purpose of Phil&rsquo;s question might have been, as now he seems to be deliberating something silently. Please, God, don&rsquo;t say that Phil Novokoric is about to hand over his snow jacket to invalid-Dan so he can tell the story of his chivalry to some doe-eyed journalist months from now.&nbsp;</p><p>In a way, Dan is almost glad when Phil, predictably, says, &ldquo;another reason to invest in some proper thermals. Might have been an idea, considering you&rsquo;re living up a snowy mountain.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Noted,&rdquo; Dan says through gritted teeth. Finally, the sight of the hotel crests the horizon, some way off still, but at least within view. &ldquo;Thank the fucking Lord,&rdquo; he mutters under his breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You could get on my back for the last bit, if you like,&rdquo; Phil suggests, tone lilting into something like a tease.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alright, thanks,&rdquo; Dan replies tersely. He sincerely wishes he could extricate himself from this infuriating human and sprint the rest of the way back, but unfortunately he thinks he might snap his own ankle off, brittle as it is now from the cold. &ldquo;Can we just focus on getting to the hotel without any further injuries, please?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Phil says, then effortlessly hitches Dan&rsquo;s arm a little higher across his shoulders, taking on significantly more of his weight. For a reason Dan refuses to analyse, this action makes his stomach flip multiple times, but he has no time to dwell on the how&rsquo;s or why&rsquo;s, because Phil has doubled the pace now, near-dragging Dan along.<br /></p><p>(<a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven!</a>)</p>",

It had been every twenty minutes or so, pounding loudly throughout the stupid party where Dan had found herself. A month ago she would have loved hearing it so often. But then again, a month ago she had a reason to love hearing it.</p><p>One whole month. That\u2019s how long it had taken Dan to muster enough energy and desire to want to actually get out of the house for the first time in entirely too long. The persistent texts from her friends had been piling up, reminding her that her self-care was not the only thing she was neglecting these days. It was hard though; breakups sucked, especially when they were with someone who said they loved you and wanted to spend their lives with you. Yeah, it definitely sucked.</p><!-- more --><p>Instead of complaining about the song, or leaving like she really, really wanted to, Dan just threw back the rest of her drink and stood up to get another. Her friends called after her, yelling for her to get them drinks, too, but she just flipped them off and gave a bark of laughter. She really was a dick sometimes.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many people in the kitchen where the booze had been stationed, just a few guys playing beer pong and milling around. Dan headed straight for the flimsy red cups and started pouring herself some more Malibu.</p><p>\u201cCan I make you a drink, sweetheart?\u201d a drunk voice slurred behind her.</p><p>She turned and faced the person who the voice belonged to. If they were in America, Dan thought he might be called a frat boy: he wasn\u2019t that attractive, but he gave off the air of thinking he was the hottest guy in the place.</p><p>\u201cUh. No, I\u2019m good,\u201d she said, holding up her cup.</p><p>She turned back around to fiddle with the bottles on the counter, hoping he would get the hint, but the man moved closer, leaning into her space.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby. Just one drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He started to say something else, his hand approaching her wrist, when a body moved between them, forcing the man to move back.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. Did you make our drinks yet?\u201d</p><p>Dan stared at the girl next to her, and gave her a relieved smile.</p><p>\u201cUh, no, babe,\u201d she raised her eyebrows to the girl, who just smiled back. \u201cI was working on them. I wasn\u2019t sure what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>The man sneered at them and turned back towards the living room. He murmured something under his breath, surely nothing kind, and left. Normally Dan would say something, tell him not to be a homophobic piece of shit, but she didn\u2019t have it in her tonight. It felt like the little spark that was usually in her was dimmed beyond repair.</p><p>She glanced at her unlikely hero, still standing there and apparently waiting to make a drink, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d Dan said quietly, giving her a small smile.</p><p>She waved her hand nonchalantly. \u201cNo problem. Guys like that are the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dan wanted to say more, but she was unsure if it would be appropriate to try and make conversation with someone who had literally just kept her from being hit on.</p><p>Dan realized she hadn\u2019t said or done anything in about five seconds, instead just standing there staring at the stranger, and she shook her head to clear her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, Ms. Bartender, will you make me a drink, too?\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled a little and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalibu and Coke, please,\u201d she answered, giving Dan a wide smile and making her breath catch a little.</p><p>Dan tried to focus on making a decent drink, not wanting this kind stranger to be subjected to her heavy hand, and turned slightly, trying to subtly get a good look at the girl. She was pretty, but not in what was probably considered a conventional way. She was tall and a bit gangly, and the way her fingers twitched against the counter made Dan think that she probably rarely held still. Her nose was a bit big, and slightly hooked, but it looked nice, Dan thought. The black of her hair seemed a bit unnatural, especially considering how ginger her eyebrows looked, and Dan was suddenly bursting to ask if it was dyed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said when Dan handed her the drink, taking a liberal sip.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t sure what to do in response, so she took her own drink, almost coughing at how strong she had made it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d the girl said, extending her free hand out to Dan.</p><p>Dan shook it, giving her a shy smile. \u201cI\u2019m Dan.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were like silk in Dan\u2019s calloused hand, and before she could stop herself, she was blurting out, \u201cHoly shit your hands are soft.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, giving Dan\u2019s a little squeeze. \u201cI moisturize everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>God. Dan needed a muzzle sometimes. What was it about this stupidly pretty girl that was making Dan act like this was her first sip of alcohol and she had just seen a girl for the first time?</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything in response, just simply tugged on their attached hands and led Dan back into the living room where she flopped onto the loveseat, pulling Dan down to sit next to her. It was crowded, and people on both sides of them were getting fairly handsy with each other, but Dan didn\u2019t care. She remembered when she was one of those couples, so far be it from her to get judgy about other people\u2019s PDA.</p><p>\u201cDo you go to uni at York, too?\u201d Phil asked, bring Dan\u2019s attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, no. I\u2019m up touring unis with a few of my mates and they dragged me out here. I live in Wokingham.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded \u201cSo, what do you think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Lots of geese.\u201d</p><p>She laughed out loud, her head thumping back against the couch and her whole body shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes, \u201cthat\u2019s just the most accurate way you could have described it. I think I\u2019m developing anatidaephobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear of geese?\u201d</p><p>Phil looked a little surprised that Dan knew the actual term, but nodded, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cI had to Google what the word for goose phobia was when I started here. Google says it isn\u2019t a real thing, but apparently they\u2019ve never been to York during mating season.\u201d</p><p>It was Dan\u2019s turn to laugh, a boisterous noise leaving her before she could help it. Phil\u2019s eyes got little crinkles in the corners when she smiled, Dan couldn\u2019t help but notice, and her eyes were really blue. Tiny little flickers of other colors made them even prettier. Dan could feel herself start to blush, and took a long pull from her drink. The last thing she needed was to fall head over heels for a pretty girl just because she was nice to her. That usually just ended in Dan\u2019s heart getting broken.</p><p>That stupid fucking song started played again. Someone must have made a playlist and stuck it on there a thousand times. Probably just to annoy Dan. She made an annoyed noise and Phil gave her a confused look, likely assuming Dan was making it at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I just hate this song.\u201d She took another drink of her quickly diminishing drink and hoped Phil wouldn\u2019t ask why.</p><p>\u201cUgh. Me, too. I think it\u2019s really overrated.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt defensive for about half a second, almost wanting to tell Phil off for not appreciating such a good song, but stopped herself. If she really listened to the song, she found she didn\u2019t <i>really</i> like it. Sam had always liked it, and that was why it became their song. Maybe that should have been a red flag. What kind of relationship is it if one person is making all the decisions and the other is just along for the ride?</p><p>\u201cIt reminds me of someone,\u201d Dan said quietly. Apparently her brain had not gotten the memo that she didn\u2019t want to talk about.</p><p>\u201cAn ex?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked at her for a second before replying. Phil didn\u2019t look like she was asking to dig for gossip. She looked like someone who understood how shitty Dan was probably feeling, and Dan found herself nodding.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s dumb, I should be over it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I ask how long it\u2019s been?\u201d</p><p>They had turned toward each other at some point, maybe in an effort to put some distance between themselves and the lascivious couples next to them. It was easy for Dan to look at her over the rim of Phil\u2019s cup and make eye contact. There was something about those big blue eyes that made Dan feel like she could spill all her guts to this stranger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a month on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not that long,\u201d she reassured. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the last time I went through a breakup, it took me a month just to leave my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been rough. Shit sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came out tonight! That\u2019s something!\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help smiling; there was something so infectious about Phil\u2019s smile. Maybe it was those eye crinkles, or the way she stuck her tongue out a little when her smile got too wide. Even the way her teeth were a bit crooked didn\u2019t take away from how cute it was.</p><p>Cute. <i>Fuck</i>, Dan thought. Having a crush on someone she didn\u2019t even know was not gonna do her any favors.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go get a refill,\u201d she said, holding up her nearly empty cup.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked a bit sad maybe, but Dan ignored it and stood up, although her body protested, not wanting to leave the warm and comfy couch. Especially not wanting to leave the way that Phil\u2019s thigh had been pressed tightly against her own the whole time they had been sat there.</p><p>Dan made a beeline to the kitchen, pouring herself another strong drink and nearly drank it all down in three gulps. She wanted to try and drink away that bit of sadness still lingering in her heart, but also the warmth that had grown there since she had started talking to Phil.</p><p>Instead of going back to the couch, Dan took a door that ended up leading to a laundry room and sat on the cold linoleum, slopping her drink a little when she moved too quickly. She pulled her phone out and clicked on the photo icon and a flood of bittersweet memories filled her screen. Her with Sam at Reading Festival last year, both their hair wild and a bit dirty, their clothes stained from the drinks and mud that had been in abundance that year.</p><p>Photos of Sam\u2019s birthday and the cake that Dan had attempted to bake that turned out to be a disaster of flour and icing. Sam had pretended to love it, though, cooing about how thoughtful and sweet Dan was while they choked down the almost inedible dessert.</p><p>Christmas, birthdays, mini holidays when they could get away from their parents and spend some time together. Pictures with friends, some of whom Dan didn\u2019t even talk to anymore because they had taken Sam\u2019s side when Dan\u2019s heart was ripped out of her chest.</p><p>She locked her phone and let her head fall back on to the washer. She should have known better than to look at the photos. They never did anything other than make her feel sad and bitter that she had spent two years with someone who had no qualms about ending it and breaking her heart.</p><p>The door to the room opened and Phil stood there, looking surprised to find Dan sitting in the dim room by herself.</p><p>\u201cUh. Hi,\u201d Dan said, feeling her cheeks flush with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil chuckled. She moved around Dan and took a stack of cups off of the shelf before moving back to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Dan just shrugged. She didn\u2019t really know if she was or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you need to talk, I\u2019d be happy to listen.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was warm and genuine, and Dan thought about following her out and sitting back on the couch with her and smelling more of that fruity perfume she was wearing, but she just gave a bit of a forced smile and said thank you. Phil gave her a nod of acknowledgment and shut the door behind her.</p><p>Dan drew her legs to her chest and rested her head against her knees.</p><p>She was being a bit stupid, she knew she was. If she really thought about it, she hadn&rsquo;t even been that happy with Sam. There were more moments of tenseness and arguments then there was actual happiness. That was the problem with pictures, she thought: they only showed the happy moments, and it was easy for her to forget that things hadn\u2019t been good between them. Sam was selfish and a bit mean sometimes, and Dan knew deep down that she really was better off, but it still sucked. And the idea of putting herself out there, even just a little, was terrifying. What if Phil was worse than Sam was? What if Phil hurt her?</p><p><i>What if she doesn\u2019t, though?</i> her brain supplied.</p><p>She was stopped short by that thought. The buzz the rum was providing was enough to fuel her into action. Though she was a bit wobbly, she managed to get up off the floor and open the door to try and find Phil.</p><p>The first place she looked was the kitchen because it was closest, and because she kind of did need another drink if she was gonna do this.</p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t by the drinks or playing beer pong with the group of people that had gathered at the table, so Dan left to scour the living room. She didn\u2019t find Phil, but she did find her friends, who all yelled excitedly when she came into view.</p><p>\u201cDan! Where the fuck have you been?\u201d Amelia slurred. Her eyes looked heavy and the stains on the front of her shirt gave a pretty good indication that she was hammered.</p><p>\u201cJust walking around,\u201d Dan said lamely, not wanting to admit she\u2019d been hiding in the laundry room like some sort of loser. She excused herself to go look upstairs, hoping beyond hope that she wouldn\u2019t find Phil upstairs with someone else.</p><p>Upstairs was clear of Phil, though Dan got more than a few eyes full of things she wished she could remove from her brain forever. She walked back downstairs slowly, feeling a bit defeated. Finding her friends again, she told them she was gonna head back to their room, not feeling like socializing anymore.</p><p>It was quiet outside, a nice reprieve from the shitty music blaring inside. Dan tucked her hands in the pockets of her hoodie and started walking in the direction of the hotel she and her friends were staying at. It was close, at least, that was something. The quiet gave her too much time to think, something she usually avoided if she could. Being left to her thoughts usually just brought her right back to being sad about things she couldn\u2019t change. Like being broken up with, and finding someone she thought she might like, but then balls\u2019ing it up because she was a coward.</p><p>As she was walking past a shabby, all night coffee shop that had adverts on the windows talking about their \u2018new and improved pastries,\u2019 her stomach gave a loud gurgle, as though it could sense she was near food. She stopped in front of it, wondering if she was pathetic enough to go inside and eat by herself, but as her stomach growled again and she thought of the barren vending machines at the hotel, she decided she was.</p><p>The door was heavy and Dan was afraid it was locked at first, despite its signs that said \u2018open 24 hrs,\u2019 but she pulled a little harder and it gave, making a warm burst of air hit her. It was nice, she hadn\u2019t been aware of how cold it had been outside, and she rubbed her hands together to gain back some warmth.</p><p>It was pretty deserted, save for the random person tucked in the corner on the couch. Dan avoided eye contact with them, not in much of a mood to interact with anyone, and moved to the counter. She ordered a pastry and a tea from the grumpy barista and stood next to the counter, fiddling with the straw she had gotten from the supply next to her.</p><p>The barista gave her the tea and sad looking pastry and she turned to look for a seat. She <i>wanted</i> to sit on the couch but it was taken, so she settled for the armchair that was a safe enough distance that it probably wouldn\u2019t bother the other person.</p><p>Dan took a sip from her tea, and felt her mouth instantly start to burn.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she nearly shouted as the scalding tea dribbled down her chin. It was loud enough to grab the attention of the other patron and Dan nearly choked when she saw who it was.</p><p>Phil.</p><p>Dan almost swore again, not knowing if she felt happy to see her again, or just embarrassed. She\u2019d already been found looking like a sad loser once tonight, the last thing she wanted was for Phil to see her with tea running down her face and on to her hoodie.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Phil looked surprised to see her, but happy-surprised, Dan thought.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan replied, mopping off her chin and hoodie.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here.\u201d Phil smiled at Dan, making that fuzzy feeling she had at the party return. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been the Malibu that had made Dan feel that.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Dan trailed off awkwardly, suddenly feeling a bit tongue-tied. \u201cThe party was kinda boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too. Wasn\u2019t much fun after you left the couch.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt her heart start to race a bit. A smile came to her face before she had a chance to school her features, ducking her head to hide how pink her cheeks were becoming.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry about that. I got a bit overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said gently. \u201cHappens to all of us.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up and stared for a beat, and then made a decision she didn\u2019t know she was considering and stood up to sit closer. She sat down on the couch, but far enough away from Phil that Dan hoped she didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI left \u2018cause I couldn\u2019t find you to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>It felt like a bit too much to say to this virtual stranger, but as soon as Dan said it, she was happy she did. The answering smile Phil gave her made her feel like she was looking directly at the sun.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I came on too strong,\u201d she said quietly, as if she was nervous to admit it.</p><p>Dan shook her head so hard her hair started flying about, making her try and press it back to her head to calm the curly mess.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Well, maybe a little bit.\u201d Phil\u2019s face fell a little, and Dan scrambled to correct herself. \u201cNo, no, no! It wasn\u2019t like, a bad thing. I\u2019m just overwhelmed kind of in general right now. Talking to you was really great. Just overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a good overwhelming?\u201d She sounded hopeful and it made butterflies burst in Dan\u2019s tummy.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>They sat grinning at each other before both tucking their heads into their chests. It was a touch awkward, but Dan was determined to follow things through. At least that way she wouldn\u2019t look back on the night and regret it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go for a walk?\u201d</p><p>She was taking a chance, and though she was happy she was, a spike of anxiety went through her until Phil nodded and stood to follow her out. Dan wrapped her pastry in her napkin and stuffed it into her hoodie pouch, hunger temporarily forgotten.</p><p>Phil lead the way once they were outside, since Dan didn\u2019t actually have much idea where they were.</p><p>\u201cSo, Wokingham? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Phil\u2019s breath was visible, coming out of her mouth in short puffs as she spoke.</p><p>Dan waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIt blows. It\u2019s boring as fuck, and the people suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always lived there?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. \u201cHopefully not forever, though. What about you? Have you always lived in York?\u201d</p><p>Phil shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m from Rawtenstall. Near Manchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManchester has the wheel right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, grinning. \u201cIt was my favorite when I was little. I would always beg my parents to let me go on it by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be scary?\u201d</p><p>Phil shook her head. \u201cI loved it! The view was so pretty and I liked to pretend I was a grown up living by myself in Manchester. I couldn\u2019t wait to grow up, but now I kind of feel like I\u2019m still a kid. I think I\u2019m afraid to be an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Dan understood that all too well.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna start uni right away? Or are you taking a gap year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gap year,\u201d Dan said a bit sadly.</p><p>All the plans she had for her gap year all of a sudden felt foolish and silly. Plans with Sam that she had to try and rearrange or cancel now. Plans with people who weren\u2019t even her friends anymore. She felt her face start to fall and tried to rearrange her features a bit to hide it, but Phil was observant and caught on.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous about taking a gap year?\u201d She must have misinterpreted Dan\u2019s facial expression, and Dan thought for a second about lying, but didn\u2019t figure that would get her anywhere good.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just made a bunch of plans with this person I was dating, and now I have to cancel them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. That sucks, I\u2019m sorry. Breakups suck.\u201d</p><p>Dan agreed, but didn\u2019t say much more, not ready to talk about it just yet.</p><p>They walked by a deserted park and Dan felt that impulsive urge deep inside her; she grabbed Phil\u2019s hand and started running towards the swings. Phil followed, laughing loudly and holding tight to Dan\u2019s hand. It felt nice. She missed having someone to give her affection to.</p><p>They parted to sit on the swings, and Dan felt a small pang at having to let Phil\u2019s hand go. Dan pushed off the ground with all her might, kicking her legs as quick as she could to help increase her speed. She pumped and pumped her legs, letting out a shriek when she realized how high she had gotten. She dragged her feet to slow down, and by the time she had nearly stopped, Phil was doubled over laughing, almost in tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Dan asked, feeling a bit defensive.</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face was so cute! You looked like you thought you were gonna fly for a second.\u201d</p><p>The word \u2018cute\u2019 bounced around Dan\u2019s brain for a few seconds before she realized she hadn\u2019t replied.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI got real scared there for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Phil reached out for Dan\u2019s hand and she didn\u2019t even hesitate before taking it. She was reminded how soft it was in her own, and rubbed her fingers against the back. Phil stared at their hands before looking up at Dan and holding her gaze.</p><p>God, her eyes were pretty. Dan was sure that if the moon was a person, they would surely be jealous of how bright Phil\u2019s eyes shined. She found herself getting a little lost in them, and before she knew, it they were both leaning forward and their lips met.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips were cold and a bit dry, though Dan was sure hers were no better, but as they leaned closer and Phil\u2019s parted, Dan felt a literal shock run through her. Phil felt it to, leaning back and touching her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou shocked me,\u201d she laughed, fingers still pressed against them.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say we have a spark.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed so hard she almost fell off her swing.</p><p>\u201cToo cheesy?\u201d Dan asked, unable to help the smile growing on her face.</p><p>\u201cA little bit. But cheesy\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Dan could use some cheesy in her life.</p>",

That\u2019s how long it had taken Dan to muster enough energy and desire to want to actually get out of the house for the first time in entirely too long. The persistent texts from her friends had been piling up, reminding her that her self-care was not the only thing she was neglecting these days. It was hard though; breakups sucked, especially when they were with someone who said they loved you and wanted to spend their lives with you. Yeah, it definitely sucked.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Instead of complaining about the song, or leaving like she really, really wanted to, Dan just threw back the rest of her drink and stood up to get another. Her friends called after her, yelling for her to get them drinks, too, but she just flipped them off and gave a bark of laughter. She really was a dick sometimes.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many people in the kitchen where the booze had been stationed, just a few guys playing beer pong and milling around. Dan headed straight for the flimsy red cups and started pouring herself some more Malibu.</p><p>\u201cCan I make you a drink, sweetheart?\u201d a drunk voice slurred behind her.</p><p>She turned and faced the person who the voice belonged to. If they were in America, Dan thought he might be called a frat boy: he wasn\u2019t that attractive, but he gave off the air of thinking he was the hottest guy in the place.</p><p>\u201cUh. No, I\u2019m good,\u201d she said, holding up her cup.</p><p>She turned back around to fiddle with the bottles on the counter, hoping he would get the hint, but the man moved closer, leaning into her space.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby. Just one drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He started to say something else, his hand approaching her wrist, when a body moved between them, forcing the man to move back.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. Did you make our drinks yet?\u201d</p><p>Dan stared at the girl next to her, and gave her a relieved smile.</p><p>\u201cUh, no, babe,\u201d she raised her eyebrows to the girl, who just smiled back. \u201cI was working on them. I wasn\u2019t sure what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>The man sneered at them and turned back towards the living room. He murmured something under his breath, surely nothing kind, and left. Normally Dan would say something, tell him not to be a homophobic piece of shit, but she didn\u2019t have it in her tonight. It felt like the little spark that was usually in her was dimmed beyond repair.</p><p>She glanced at her unlikely hero, still standing there and apparently waiting to make a drink, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d Dan said quietly, giving her a small smile.</p><p>She waved her hand nonchalantly. \u201cNo problem. Guys like that are the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dan wanted to say more, but she was unsure if it would be appropriate to try and make conversation with someone who had literally just kept her from being hit on.</p><p>Dan realized she hadn\u2019t said or done anything in about five seconds, instead just standing there staring at the stranger, and she shook her head to clear her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, Ms. Bartender, will you make me a drink, too?\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled a little and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalibu and Coke, please,\u201d she answered, giving Dan a wide smile and making her breath catch a little.</p><p>Dan tried to focus on making a decent drink, not wanting this kind stranger to be subjected to her heavy hand, and turned slightly, trying to subtly get a good look at the girl. She was pretty, but not in what was probably considered a conventional way. She was tall and a bit gangly, and the way her fingers twitched against the counter made Dan think that she probably rarely held still. Her nose was a bit big, and slightly hooked, but it looked nice, Dan thought. The black of her hair seemed a bit unnatural, especially considering how ginger her eyebrows looked, and Dan was suddenly bursting to ask if it was dyed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said when Dan handed her the drink, taking a liberal sip.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t sure what to do in response, so she took her own drink, almost coughing at how strong she had made it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d the girl said, extending her free hand out to Dan.</p><p>Dan shook it, giving her a shy smile. \u201cI\u2019m Dan.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were like silk in Dan\u2019s calloused hand, and before she could stop herself, she was blurting out, \u201cHoly shit your hands are soft.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, giving Dan\u2019s a little squeeze. \u201cI moisturize everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>God. Dan needed a muzzle sometimes. What was it about this stupidly pretty girl that was making Dan act like this was her first sip of alcohol and she had just seen a girl for the first time?</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything in response, just simply tugged on their attached hands and led Dan back into the living room where she flopped onto the loveseat, pulling Dan down to sit next to her. It was crowded, and people on both sides of them were getting fairly handsy with each other, but Dan didn\u2019t care. She remembered when she was one of those couples, so far be it from her to get judgy about other people\u2019s PDA.</p><p>\u201cDo you go to uni at York, too?\u201d Phil asked, bring Dan\u2019s attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, no. I\u2019m up touring unis with a few of my mates and they dragged me out here. I live in Wokingham.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded \u201cSo, what do you think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Lots of geese.\u201d</p><p>She laughed out loud, her head thumping back against the couch and her whole body shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes, \u201cthat\u2019s just the most accurate way you could have described it. I think I\u2019m developing anatidaephobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear of geese?\u201d</p><p>Phil looked a little surprised that Dan knew the actual term, but nodded, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cI had to Google what the word for goose phobia was when I started here. Google says it isn\u2019t a real thing, but apparently they\u2019ve never been to York during mating season.\u201d</p><p>It was Dan\u2019s turn to laugh, a boisterous noise leaving her before she could help it. Phil\u2019s eyes got little crinkles in the corners when she smiled, Dan couldn\u2019t help but notice, and her eyes were really blue. Tiny little flickers of other colors made them even prettier. Dan could feel herself start to blush, and took a long pull from her drink. The last thing she needed was to fall head over heels for a pretty girl just because she was nice to her. That usually just ended in Dan\u2019s heart getting broken.</p><p>That stupid fucking song started played again. Someone must have made a playlist and stuck it on there a thousand times. Probably just to annoy Dan. She made an annoyed noise and Phil gave her a confused look, likely assuming Dan was making it at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I just hate this song.\u201d She took another drink of her quickly diminishing drink and hoped Phil wouldn\u2019t ask why.</p><p>\u201cUgh. Me, too. I think it\u2019s really overrated.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt defensive for about half a second, almost wanting to tell Phil off for not appreciating such a good song, but stopped herself. If she really listened to the song, she found she didn\u2019t <i>really</i> like it. Sam had always liked it, and that was why it became their song. Maybe that should have been a red flag. What kind of relationship is it if one person is making all the decisions and the other is just along for the ride?</p><p>\u201cIt reminds me of someone,\u201d Dan said quietly. Apparently her brain had not gotten the memo that she didn\u2019t want to talk about.</p><p>\u201cAn ex?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked at her for a second before replying. Phil didn\u2019t look like she was asking to dig for gossip. She looked like someone who understood how shitty Dan was probably feeling, and Dan found herself nodding.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s dumb, I should be over it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I ask how long it\u2019s been?\u201d</p><p>They had turned toward each other at some point, maybe in an effort to put some distance between themselves and the lascivious couples next to them. It was easy for Dan to look at her over the rim of Phil\u2019s cup and make eye contact. There was something about those big blue eyes that made Dan feel like she could spill all her guts to this stranger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a month on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not that long,\u201d she reassured. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the last time I went through a breakup, it took me a month just to leave my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been rough. Shit sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came out tonight! That\u2019s something!\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help smiling; there was something so infectious about Phil\u2019s smile. Maybe it was those eye crinkles, or the way she stuck her tongue out a little when her smile got too wide. Even the way her teeth were a bit crooked didn\u2019t take away from how cute it was.</p><p>Cute. <i>Fuck</i>, Dan thought. Having a crush on someone she didn\u2019t even know was not gonna do her any favors.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go get a refill,\u201d she said, holding up her nearly empty cup.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked a bit sad maybe, but Dan ignored it and stood up, although her body protested, not wanting to leave the warm and comfy couch. Especially not wanting to leave the way that Phil\u2019s thigh had been pressed tightly against her own the whole time they had been sat there.</p><p>Dan made a beeline to the kitchen, pouring herself another strong drink and nearly drank it all down in three gulps. She wanted to try and drink away that bit of sadness still lingering in her heart, but also the warmth that had grown there since she had started talking to Phil.</p><p>Instead of going back to the couch, Dan took a door that ended up leading to a laundry room and sat on the cold linoleum, slopping her drink a little when she moved too quickly. She pulled her phone out and clicked on the photo icon and a flood of bittersweet memories filled her screen. Her with Sam at Reading Festival last year, both their hair wild and a bit dirty, their clothes stained from the drinks and mud that had been in abundance that year.</p><p>Photos of Sam\u2019s birthday and the cake that Dan had attempted to bake that turned out to be a disaster of flour and icing. Sam had pretended to love it, though, cooing about how thoughtful and sweet Dan was while they choked down the almost inedible dessert.</p><p>Christmas, birthdays, mini holidays when they could get away from their parents and spend some time together. Pictures with friends, some of whom Dan didn\u2019t even talk to anymore because they had taken Sam\u2019s side when Dan\u2019s heart was ripped out of her chest.</p><p>She locked her phone and let her head fall back on to the washer. She should have known better than to look at the photos. They never did anything other than make her feel sad and bitter that she had spent two years with someone who had no qualms about ending it and breaking her heart.</p><p>The door to the room opened and Phil stood there, looking surprised to find Dan sitting in the dim room by herself.</p><p>\u201cUh. Hi,\u201d Dan said, feeling her cheeks flush with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil chuckled. She moved around Dan and took a stack of cups off of the shelf before moving back to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Dan just shrugged. She didn\u2019t really know if she was or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you need to talk, I\u2019d be happy to listen.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was warm and genuine, and Dan thought about following her out and sitting back on the couch with her and smelling more of that fruity perfume she was wearing, but she just gave a bit of a forced smile and said thank you. Phil gave her a nod of acknowledgment and shut the door behind her.</p><p>Dan drew her legs to her chest and rested her head against her knees.</p><p>She was being a bit stupid, she knew she was. If she really thought about it, she hadn\u2019t even been that happy with Sam. There were more moments of tenseness and arguments then there was actual happiness. That was the problem with pictures, she thought: they only showed the happy moments, and it was easy for her to forget that things hadn\u2019t been good between them. Sam was selfish and a bit mean sometimes, and Dan knew deep down that she really was better off, but it still sucked. And the idea of putting herself out there, even just a little, was terrifying. What if Phil was worse than Sam was? What if Phil hurt her?</p><p><i>What if she doesn\u2019t, though?</i> her brain supplied.</p><p>She was stopped short by that thought. The buzz the rum was providing was enough to fuel her into action. Though she was a bit wobbly, she managed to get up off the floor and open the door to try and find Phil.</p><p>The first place she looked was the kitchen because it was closest, and because she kind of did need another drink if she was gonna do this.</p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t by the drinks or playing beer pong with the group of people that had gathered at the table, so Dan left to scour the living room. She didn\u2019t find Phil, but she did find her friends, who all yelled excitedly when she came into view.</p><p>\u201cDan! Where the fuck have you been?\u201d Amelia slurred. Her eyes looked heavy and the stains on the front of her shirt gave a pretty good indication that she was hammered.</p><p>\u201cJust walking around,\u201d Dan said lamely, not wanting to admit she\u2019d been hiding in the laundry room like some sort of loser. She excused herself to go look upstairs, hoping beyond hope that she wouldn\u2019t find Phil upstairs with someone else.</p><p>Upstairs was clear of Phil, though Dan got more than a few eyes full of things she wished she could remove from her brain forever. She walked back downstairs slowly, feeling a bit defeated. Finding her friends again, she told them she was gonna head back to their room, not feeling like socializing anymore.</p><p>It was quiet outside, a nice reprieve from the shitty music blaring inside. Dan tucked her hands in the pockets of her hoodie and started walking in the direction of the hotel she and her friends were staying at. It was close, at least, that was something. The quiet gave her too much time to think, something she usually avoided if she could. Being left to her thoughts usually just brought her right back to being sad about things she couldn\u2019t change. Like being broken up with, and finding someone she thought she might like, but then balls\u2019ing it up because she was a coward.</p><p>As she was walking past a shabby, all night coffee shop that had adverts on the windows talking about their \u2018new and improved pastries,\u2019 her stomach gave a loud gurgle, as though it could sense she was near food. She stopped in front of it, wondering if she was pathetic enough to go inside and eat by herself, but as her stomach growled again and she thought of the barren vending machines at the hotel, she decided she was.</p><p>The door was heavy and Dan was afraid it was locked at first, despite its signs that said \u2018open 24 hrs,\u2019 but she pulled a little harder and it gave, making a warm burst of air hit her. It was nice, she hadn\u2019t been aware of how cold it had been outside, and she rubbed her hands together to gain back some warmth.</p><p>It was pretty deserted, save for the random person tucked in the corner on the couch. Dan avoided eye contact with them, not in much of a mood to interact with anyone, and moved to the counter. She ordered a pastry and a tea from the grumpy barista and stood next to the counter, fiddling with the straw she had gotten from the supply next to her.</p><p>The barista gave her the tea and sad looking pastry and she turned to look for a seat. She <i>wanted</i> to sit on the couch but it was taken, so she settled for the armchair that was a safe enough distance that it probably wouldn\u2019t bother the other person.</p><p>Dan took a sip from her tea, and felt her mouth instantly start to burn.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she nearly shouted as the scalding tea dribbled down her chin. It was loud enough to grab the attention of the other patron and Dan nearly choked when she saw who it was.</p><p>Phil.</p><p>Dan almost swore again, not knowing if she felt happy to see her again, or just embarrassed. She\u2019d already been found looking like a sad loser once tonight, the last thing she wanted was for Phil to see her with tea running down her face and on to her hoodie.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Phil looked surprised to see her, but happy-surprised, Dan thought.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan replied, mopping off her chin and hoodie.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here.\u201d Phil smiled at Dan, making that fuzzy feeling she had at the party return. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been the Malibu that had made Dan feel that.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Dan trailed off awkwardly, suddenly feeling a bit tongue-tied. \u201cThe party was kinda boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too. Wasn\u2019t much fun after you left the couch.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt her heart start to race a bit. A smile came to her face before she had a chance to school her features, ducking her head to hide how pink her cheeks were becoming.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry about that. I got a bit overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said gently. \u201cHappens to all of us.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up and stared for a beat, and then made a decision she didn\u2019t know she was considering and stood up to sit closer. She sat down on the couch, but far enough away from Phil that Dan hoped she didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI left \u2018cause I couldn\u2019t find you to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>It felt like a bit too much to say to this virtual stranger, but as soon as Dan said it, she was happy she did. The answering smile Phil gave her made her feel like she was looking directly at the sun.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I came on too strong,\u201d she said quietly, as if she was nervous to admit it.</p><p>Dan shook her head so hard her hair started flying about, making her try and press it back to her head to calm the curly mess.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Well, maybe a little bit.\u201d Phil\u2019s face fell a little, and Dan scrambled to correct herself. \u201cNo, no, no! It wasn\u2019t like, a bad thing. I\u2019m just overwhelmed kind of in general right now. Talking to you was really great. Just overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a good overwhelming?\u201d She sounded hopeful and it made butterflies burst in Dan\u2019s tummy.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>They sat grinning at each other before both tucking their heads into their chests. It was a touch awkward, but Dan was determined to follow things through. At least that way she wouldn\u2019t look back on the night and regret it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go for a walk?\u201d</p><p>She was taking a chance, and though she was happy she was, a spike of anxiety went through her until Phil nodded and stood to follow her out. Dan wrapped her pastry in her napkin and stuffed it into her hoodie pouch, hunger temporarily forgotten.</p><p>Phil lead the way once they were outside, since Dan didn\u2019t actually have much idea where they were.</p><p>\u201cSo, Wokingham? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Phil\u2019s breath was visible, coming out of her mouth in short puffs as she spoke.</p><p>Dan waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIt blows. It\u2019s boring as fuck, and the people suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always lived there?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. \u201cHopefully not forever, though. What about you? Have you always lived in York?\u201d</p><p>Phil shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m from Rawtenstall. Near Manchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManchester has the wheel right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, grinning. \u201cIt was my favorite when I was little. I would always beg my parents to let me go on it by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be scary?\u201d</p><p>Phil shook her head. \u201cI loved it! The view was so pretty and I liked to pretend I was a grown up living by myself in Manchester. I couldn\u2019t wait to grow up, but now I kind of feel like I\u2019m still a kid. I think I\u2019m afraid to be an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Dan understood that all too well.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna start uni right away? Or are you taking a gap year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gap year,\u201d Dan said a bit sadly.</p><p>All the plans she had for her gap year all of a sudden felt foolish and silly. Plans with Sam that she had to try and rearrange or cancel now. Plans with people who weren\u2019t even her friends anymore. She felt her face start to fall and tried to rearrange her features a bit to hide it, but Phil was observant and caught on.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous about taking a gap year?\u201d She must have misinterpreted Dan\u2019s facial expression, and Dan thought for a second about lying, but didn\u2019t figure that would get her anywhere good.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just made a bunch of plans with this person I was dating, and now I have to cancel them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. That sucks, I\u2019m sorry. Breakups suck.\u201d</p><p>Dan agreed, but didn\u2019t say much more, not ready to talk about it just yet.</p><p>They walked by a deserted park and Dan felt that impulsive urge deep inside her; she grabbed Phil\u2019s hand and started running towards the swings. Phil followed, laughing loudly and holding tight to Dan\u2019s hand. It felt nice. She missed having someone to give her affection to.</p><p>They parted to sit on the swings, and Dan felt a small pang at having to let Phil\u2019s hand go. Dan pushed off the ground with all her might, kicking her legs as quick as she could to help increase her speed. She pumped and pumped her legs, letting out a shriek when she realized how high she had gotten. She dragged her feet to slow down, and by the time she had nearly stopped, Phil was doubled over laughing, almost in tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Dan asked, feeling a bit defensive.</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face was so cute! You looked like you thought you were gonna fly for a second.\u201d</p><p>The word \u2018cute\u2019 bounced around Dan\u2019s brain for a few seconds before she realized she hadn\u2019t replied.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI got real scared there for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Phil reached out for Dan\u2019s hand and she didn\u2019t even hesitate before taking it. She was reminded how soft it was in her own, and rubbed her fingers against the back. Phil stared at their hands before looking up at Dan and holding her gaze.</p><p>God, her eyes were pretty. Dan was sure that if the moon was a person, they would surely be jealous of how bright Phil\u2019s eyes shined. She found herself getting a little lost in them, and before she knew, it they were both leaning forward and their lips met.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips were cold and a bit dry, though Dan was sure hers were no better, but as they leaned closer and Phil\u2019s parted, Dan felt a literal shock run through her. Phil felt it to, leaning back and touching her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou shocked me,\u201d she laughed, fingers still pressed against them.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say we have a spark.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed so hard she almost fell off her swing.</p><p>\u201cToo cheesy?\u201d Dan asked, unable to help the smile growing on her face.</p><p>\u201cA little bit. But cheesy\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Dan could use some cheesy in her life.</p>",

It had been every twenty minutes or so, pounding loudly throughout the stupid party where Dan had found herself. A month ago she would have loved hearing it so often. But then again, a month ago she had a reason to love hearing it.</p><p>One whole month. That\u2019s how long it had taken Dan to muster enough energy and desire to want to actually get out of the house for the first time in entirely too long. The persistent texts from her friends had been piling up, reminding her that her self-care was not the only thing she was neglecting these days. It was hard though; breakups sucked, especially when they were with someone who said they loved you and wanted to spend their lives with you. Yeah, it definitely sucked.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Instead of complaining about the song, or leaving like she really, really wanted to, Dan just threw back the rest of her drink and stood up to get another. Her friends called after her, yelling for her to get them drinks, too, but she just flipped them off and gave a bark of laughter. She really was a dick sometimes.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many people in the kitchen where the booze had been stationed, just a few guys playing beer pong and milling around. Dan headed straight for the flimsy red cups and started pouring herself some more Malibu.</p><p>\u201cCan I make you a drink, sweetheart?\u201d a drunk voice slurred behind her.</p><p>She turned and faced the person who the voice belonged to. If they were in America, Dan thought he might be called a frat boy: he wasn\u2019t that attractive, but he gave off the air of thinking he was the hottest guy in the place.</p><p>\u201cUh. No, I\u2019m good,\u201d she said, holding up her cup.</p><p>She turned back around to fiddle with the bottles on the counter, hoping he would get the hint, but the man moved closer, leaning into her space.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby. Just one drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>He started to say something else, his hand approaching her wrist, when a body moved between them, forcing the man to move back.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. Did you make our drinks yet?\u201d</p><p>Dan stared at the girl next to her, and gave her a relieved smile.</p><p>\u201cUh, no, babe,\u201d she raised her eyebrows to the girl, who just smiled back. \u201cI was working on them. I wasn\u2019t sure what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>The man sneered at them and turned back towards the living room. He murmured something under his breath, surely nothing kind, and left. Normally Dan would say something, tell him not to be a homophobic piece of shit, but she didn\u2019t have it in her tonight. It felt like the little spark that was usually in her was dimmed beyond repair.</p><p>She glanced at her unlikely hero, still standing there and apparently waiting to make a drink, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d Dan said quietly, giving her a small smile.</p><p>She waved her hand nonchalantly. \u201cNo problem. Guys like that are the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dan wanted to say more, but she was unsure if it would be appropriate to try and make conversation with someone who had literally just kept her from being hit on.</p><p>Dan realized she hadn\u2019t said or done anything in about five seconds, instead just standing there staring at the stranger, and she shook her head to clear her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, Ms. Bartender, will you make me a drink, too?\u201d</p><p>Dan chuckled a little and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalibu and Coke, please,\u201d she answered, giving Dan a wide smile and making her breath catch a little.</p><p>Dan tried to focus on making a decent drink, not wanting this kind stranger to be subjected to her heavy hand, and turned slightly, trying to subtly get a good look at the girl. She was pretty, but not in what was probably considered a conventional way. She was tall and a bit gangly, and the way her fingers twitched against the counter made Dan think that she probably rarely held still. Her nose was a bit big, and slightly hooked, but it looked nice, Dan thought. The black of her hair seemed a bit unnatural, especially considering how ginger her eyebrows looked, and Dan was suddenly bursting to ask if it was dyed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said when Dan handed her the drink, taking a liberal sip.</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t sure what to do in response, so she took her own drink, almost coughing at how strong she had made it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil,\u201d the girl said, extending her free hand out to Dan.</p><p>Dan shook it, giving her a shy smile. \u201cI\u2019m Dan.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were like silk in Dan\u2019s calloused hand, and before she could stop herself, she was blurting out, \u201cHoly shit your hands are soft.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, giving Dan\u2019s a little squeeze. \u201cI moisturize everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>God. Dan needed a muzzle sometimes. What was it about this stupidly pretty girl that was making Dan act like this was her first sip of alcohol and she had just seen a girl for the first time?</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t say anything in response, just simply tugged on their attached hands and led Dan back into the living room where she flopped onto the loveseat, pulling Dan down to sit next to her. It was crowded, and people on both sides of them were getting fairly handsy with each other, but Dan didn\u2019t care. She remembered when she was one of those couples, so far be it from her to get judgy about other people\u2019s PDA.</p><p>\u201cDo you go to uni at York, too?\u201d Phil asked, bring Dan\u2019s attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, no. I\u2019m up touring unis with a few of my mates and they dragged me out here. I live in Wokingham.\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded \u201cSo, what do you think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Lots of geese.\u201d</p><p>She laughed out loud, her head thumping back against the couch and her whole body shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes, \u201cthat\u2019s just the most accurate way you could have described it. I think I\u2019m developing anatidaephobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear of geese?\u201d</p><p>Phil looked a little surprised that Dan knew the actual term, but nodded, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cI had to Google what the word for goose phobia was when I started here. Google says it isn\u2019t a real thing, but apparently they\u2019ve never been to York during mating season.\u201d</p><p>It was Dan\u2019s turn to laugh, a boisterous noise leaving her before she could help it. Phil\u2019s eyes got little crinkles in the corners when she smiled, Dan couldn\u2019t help but notice, and her eyes were really blue. Tiny little flickers of other colors made them even prettier. Dan could feel herself start to blush, and took a long pull from her drink. The last thing she needed was to fall head over heels for a pretty girl just because she was nice to her. That usually just ended in Dan\u2019s heart getting broken.</p><p>That stupid fucking song started played again. Someone must have made a playlist and stuck it on there a thousand times. Probably just to annoy Dan. She made an annoyed noise and Phil gave her a confused look, likely assuming Dan was making it at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I just hate this song.\u201d She took another drink of her quickly diminishing drink and hoped Phil wouldn\u2019t ask why.</p><p>\u201cUgh. Me, too. I think it\u2019s really overrated.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt defensive for about half a second, almost wanting to tell Phil off for not appreciating such a good song, but stopped herself. If she really listened to the song, she found she didn\u2019t <i>really</i> like it. Sam had always liked it, and that was why it became their song. Maybe that should have been a red flag. What kind of relationship is it if one person is making all the decisions and the other is just along for the ride?</p><p>\u201cIt reminds me of someone,\u201d Dan said quietly. Apparently her brain had not gotten the memo that she didn\u2019t want to talk about.</p><p>\u201cAn ex?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked at her for a second before replying. Phil didn\u2019t look like she was asking to dig for gossip. She looked like someone who understood how shitty Dan was probably feeling, and Dan found herself nodding.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s dumb, I should be over it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I ask how long it\u2019s been?\u201d</p><p>They had turned toward each other at some point, maybe in an effort to put some distance between themselves and the lascivious couples next to them. It was easy for Dan to look at her over the rim of Phil\u2019s cup and make eye contact. There was something about those big blue eyes that made Dan feel like she could spill all her guts to this stranger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a month on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not that long,\u201d she reassured. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the last time I went through a breakup, it took me a month just to leave my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been rough. Shit sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came out tonight! That\u2019s something!\u201d</p><p>Dan couldn\u2019t help smiling; there was something so infectious about Phil\u2019s smile. Maybe it was those eye crinkles, or the way she stuck her tongue out a little when her smile got too wide. Even the way her teeth were a bit crooked didn\u2019t take away from how cute it was.</p><p>Cute. <i>Fuck</i>, Dan thought. Having a crush on someone she didn\u2019t even know was not gonna do her any favors.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go get a refill,\u201d she said, holding up her nearly empty cup.</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked a bit sad maybe, but Dan ignored it and stood up, although her body protested, not wanting to leave the warm and comfy couch. Especially not wanting to leave the way that Phil\u2019s thigh had been pressed tightly against her own the whole time they had been sat there.</p><p>Dan made a beeline to the kitchen, pouring herself another strong drink and nearly drank it all down in three gulps. She wanted to try and drink away that bit of sadness still lingering in her heart, but also the warmth that had grown there since she had started talking to Phil.</p><p>Instead of going back to the couch, Dan took a door that ended up leading to a laundry room and sat on the cold linoleum, slopping her drink a little when she moved too quickly. She pulled her phone out and clicked on the photo icon and a flood of bittersweet memories filled her screen. Her with Sam at Reading Festival last year, both their hair wild and a bit dirty, their clothes stained from the drinks and mud that had been in abundance that year.</p><p>Photos of Sam\u2019s birthday and the cake that Dan had attempted to bake that turned out to be a disaster of flour and icing. Sam had pretended to love it, though, cooing about how thoughtful and sweet Dan was while they choked down the almost inedible dessert.</p><p>Christmas, birthdays, mini holidays when they could get away from their parents and spend some time together. Pictures with friends, some of whom Dan didn\u2019t even talk to anymore because they had taken Sam\u2019s side when Dan\u2019s heart was ripped out of her chest.</p><p>She locked her phone and let her head fall back on to the washer. She should have known better than to look at the photos. They never did anything other than make her feel sad and bitter that she had spent two years with someone who had no qualms about ending it and breaking her heart.</p><p>The door to the room opened and Phil stood there, looking surprised to find Dan sitting in the dim room by herself.</p><p>\u201cUh. Hi,\u201d Dan said, feeling her cheeks flush with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil chuckled. She moved around Dan and took a stack of cups off of the shelf before moving back to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Dan just shrugged. She didn\u2019t really know if she was or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you need to talk, I\u2019d be happy to listen.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was warm and genuine, and Dan thought about following her out and sitting back on the couch with her and smelling more of that fruity perfume she was wearing, but she just gave a bit of a forced smile and said thank you. Phil gave her a nod of acknowledgment and shut the door behind her.</p><p>Dan drew her legs to her chest and rested her head against her knees.</p><p>She was being a bit stupid, she knew she was. If she really thought about it, she hadn\u2019t even been that happy with Sam. There were more moments of tenseness and arguments then there was actual happiness. That was the problem with pictures, she thought: they only showed the happy moments, and it was easy for her to forget that things hadn\u2019t been good between them. Sam was selfish and a bit mean sometimes, and Dan knew deep down that she really was better off, but it still sucked. And the idea of putting herself out there, even just a little, was terrifying. What if Phil was worse than Sam was? What if Phil hurt her?</p><p><i>What if she doesn\u2019t, though?</i> her brain supplied.</p><p>She was stopped short by that thought. The buzz the rum was providing was enough to fuel her into action. Though she was a bit wobbly, she managed to get up off the floor and open the door to try and find Phil.</p><p>The first place she looked was the kitchen because it was closest, and because she kind of did need another drink if she was gonna do this.</p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t by the drinks or playing beer pong with the group of people that had gathered at the table, so Dan left to scour the living room. She didn\u2019t find Phil, but she did find her friends, who all yelled excitedly when she came into view.</p><p>\u201cDan! Where the fuck have you been?\u201d Amelia slurred. Her eyes looked heavy and the stains on the front of her shirt gave a pretty good indication that she was hammered.</p><p>\u201cJust walking around,\u201d Dan said lamely, not wanting to admit she\u2019d been hiding in the laundry room like some sort of loser. She excused herself to go look upstairs, hoping beyond hope that she wouldn\u2019t find Phil upstairs with someone else.</p><p>Upstairs was clear of Phil, though Dan got more than a few eyes full of things she wished she could remove from her brain forever. She walked back downstairs slowly, feeling a bit defeated. Finding her friends again, she told them she was gonna head back to their room, not feeling like socializing anymore.</p><p>It was quiet outside, a nice reprieve from the shitty music blaring inside. Dan tucked her hands in the pockets of her hoodie and started walking in the direction of the hotel she and her friends were staying at. It was close, at least, that was something. The quiet gave her too much time to think, something she usually avoided if she could. Being left to her thoughts usually just brought her right back to being sad about things she couldn\u2019t change. Like being broken up with, and finding someone she thought she might like, but then balls\u2019ing it up because she was a coward.</p><p>As she was walking past a shabby, all night coffee shop that had adverts on the windows talking about their \u2018new and improved pastries,\u2019 her stomach gave a loud gurgle, as though it could sense she was near food. She stopped in front of it, wondering if she was pathetic enough to go inside and eat by herself, but as her stomach growled again and she thought of the barren vending machines at the hotel, she decided she was.</p><p>The door was heavy and Dan was afraid it was locked at first, despite its signs that said \u2018open 24 hrs,\u2019 but she pulled a little harder and it gave, making a warm burst of air hit her. It was nice, she hadn\u2019t been aware of how cold it had been outside, and she rubbed her hands together to gain back some warmth.</p><p>It was pretty deserted, save for the random person tucked in the corner on the couch. Dan avoided eye contact with them, not in much of a mood to interact with anyone, and moved to the counter. She ordered a pastry and a tea from the grumpy barista and stood next to the counter, fiddling with the straw she had gotten from the supply next to her.</p><p>The barista gave her the tea and sad looking pastry and she turned to look for a seat. She <i>wanted</i> to sit on the couch but it was taken, so she settled for the armchair that was a safe enough distance that it probably wouldn\u2019t bother the other person.</p><p>Dan took a sip from her tea, and felt her mouth instantly start to burn.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she nearly shouted as the scalding tea dribbled down her chin. It was loud enough to grab the attention of the other patron and Dan nearly choked when she saw who it was.</p><p>Phil.</p><p>Dan almost swore again, not knowing if she felt happy to see her again, or just embarrassed. She\u2019d already been found looking like a sad loser once tonight, the last thing she wanted was for Phil to see her with tea running down her face and on to her hoodie.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Phil looked surprised to see her, but happy-surprised, Dan thought.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Dan replied, mopping off her chin and hoodie.</p><p>\u201cFancy seeing you here.\u201d Phil smiled at Dan, making that fuzzy feeling she had at the party return. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been the Malibu that had made Dan feel that.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Dan trailed off awkwardly, suddenly feeling a bit tongue-tied. \u201cThe party was kinda boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too. Wasn\u2019t much fun after you left the couch.\u201d</p><p>Dan felt her heart start to race a bit. A smile came to her face before she had a chance to school her features, ducking her head to hide how pink her cheeks were becoming.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry about that. I got a bit overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said gently. \u201cHappens to all of us.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked up and stared for a beat, and then made a decision she didn\u2019t know she was considering and stood up to sit closer. She sat down on the couch, but far enough away from Phil that Dan hoped she didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI left \u2018cause I couldn\u2019t find you to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>It felt like a bit too much to say to this virtual stranger, but as soon as Dan said it, she was happy she did. The answering smile Phil gave her made her feel like she was looking directly at the sun.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I came on too strong,\u201d she said quietly, as if she was nervous to admit it.</p><p>Dan shook her head so hard her hair started flying about, making her try and press it back to her head to calm the curly mess.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Well, maybe a little bit.\u201d Phil\u2019s face fell a little, and Dan scrambled to correct herself. \u201cNo, no, no! It wasn\u2019t like, a bad thing. I\u2019m just overwhelmed kind of in general right now. Talking to you was really great. Just overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, a good overwhelming?\u201d She sounded hopeful and it made butterflies burst in Dan\u2019s tummy.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>They sat grinning at each other before both tucking their heads into their chests. It was a touch awkward, but Dan was determined to follow things through. At least that way she wouldn\u2019t look back on the night and regret it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go for a walk?\u201d</p><p>She was taking a chance, and though she was happy she was, a spike of anxiety went through her until Phil nodded and stood to follow her out. Dan wrapped her pastry in her napkin and stuffed it into her hoodie pouch, hunger temporarily forgotten.</p><p>Phil lead the way once they were outside, since Dan didn\u2019t actually have much idea where they were.</p><p>\u201cSo, Wokingham? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Phil\u2019s breath was visible, coming out of her mouth in short puffs as she spoke.</p><p>Dan waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIt blows. It\u2019s boring as fuck, and the people suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always lived there?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. \u201cHopefully not forever, though. What about you? Have you always lived in York?\u201d</p><p>Phil shook her head, \u201cI\u2019m from Rawtenstall. Near Manchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManchester has the wheel right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied, grinning. \u201cIt was my favorite when I was little. I would always beg my parents to let me go on it by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be scary?\u201d</p><p>Phil shook her head. \u201cI loved it! The view was so pretty and I liked to pretend I was a grown up living by myself in Manchester. I couldn\u2019t wait to grow up, but now I kind of feel like I\u2019m still a kid. I think I\u2019m afraid to be an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Dan understood that all too well.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna start uni right away? Or are you taking a gap year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gap year,\u201d Dan said a bit sadly.</p><p>All the plans she had for her gap year all of a sudden felt foolish and silly. Plans with Sam that she had to try and rearrange or cancel now. Plans with people who weren\u2019t even her friends anymore. She felt her face start to fall and tried to rearrange her features a bit to hide it, but Phil was observant and caught on.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous about taking a gap year?\u201d She must have misinterpreted Dan\u2019s facial expression, and Dan thought for a second about lying, but didn\u2019t figure that would get her anywhere good.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just made a bunch of plans with this person I was dating, and now I have to cancel them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. That sucks, I\u2019m sorry. Breakups suck.\u201d</p><p>Dan agreed, but didn\u2019t say much more, not ready to talk about it just yet.</p><p>They walked by a deserted park and Dan felt that impulsive urge deep inside her; she grabbed Phil\u2019s hand and started running towards the swings. Phil followed, laughing loudly and holding tight to Dan\u2019s hand. It felt nice. She missed having someone to give her affection to.</p><p>They parted to sit on the swings, and Dan felt a small pang at having to let Phil\u2019s hand go. Dan pushed off the ground with all her might, kicking her legs as quick as she could to help increase her speed. She pumped and pumped her legs, letting out a shriek when she realized how high she had gotten. She dragged her feet to slow down, and by the time she had nearly stopped, Phil was doubled over laughing, almost in tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Dan asked, feeling a bit defensive.</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face was so cute! You looked like you thought you were gonna fly for a second.\u201d</p><p>The word \u2018cute\u2019 bounced around Dan\u2019s brain for a few seconds before she realized she hadn\u2019t replied.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cI got real scared there for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Phil reached out for Dan\u2019s hand and she didn\u2019t even hesitate before taking it. She was reminded how soft it was in her own, and rubbed her fingers against the back. Phil stared at their hands before looking up at Dan and holding her gaze.</p><p>God, her eyes were pretty. Dan was sure that if the moon was a person, they would surely be jealous of how bright Phil\u2019s eyes shined. She found herself getting a little lost in them, and before she knew, it they were both leaning forward and their lips met.</p><p>Phil\u2019s lips were cold and a bit dry, though Dan was sure hers were no better, but as they leaned closer and Phil\u2019s parted, Dan felt a literal shock run through her. Phil felt it to, leaning back and touching her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou shocked me,\u201d she laughed, fingers still pressed against them.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say we have a spark.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed so hard she almost fell off her swing.</p><p>\u201cToo cheesy?\u201d Dan asked, unable to help the smile growing on her face.</p><p>\u201cA little bit. But cheesy\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Dan could use some cheesy in her life.</p>",

It had been every twenty minutes or so, pounding loudly throughout the stupid party where Dan had found herself. A month ago she would have loved hearing it so often. But then again, a month ago she had a reason to love hearing it.</p><p>One whole month. That&rsquo;s how long it had taken Dan to muster enough energy and desire to want to actually get out of the house for the first time in entirely too long. The persistent texts from her friends had been piling up, reminding her that her self-care was not the only thing she was neglecting these days. It was hard though; breakups sucked, especially when they were with someone who said they loved you and wanted to spend their lives with you. Yeah, it definitely sucked.</p><p>Instead of complaining about the song, or leaving like she really, really wanted to, Dan just threw back the rest of her drink and stood up to get another. Her friends called after her, yelling for her to get them drinks, too, but she just flipped them off and gave a bark of laughter. She really was a dick sometimes.</p><p>There weren&rsquo;t many people in the kitchen where the booze had been stationed, just a few guys playing beer pong and milling around. Dan headed straight for the flimsy red cups and started pouring herself some more Malibu.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I make you a drink, sweetheart?&rdquo; a drunk voice slurred behind her.</p><p>She turned and faced the person who the voice belonged to. If they were in America, Dan thought he might be called a frat boy: he wasn&rsquo;t that attractive, but he gave off the air of thinking he was the hottest guy in the place.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh. No, I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; she said, holding up her cup.</p><p>She turned back around to fiddle with the bottles on the counter, hoping he would get the hint, but the man moved closer, leaning into her space.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, baby. Just one drink.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really fine, I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>He started to say something else, his hand approaching her wrist, when a body moved between them, forcing the man to move back.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, baby. Did you make our drinks yet?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stared at the girl next to her, and gave her a relieved smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, no, babe,&rdquo; she raised her eyebrows to the girl, who just smiled back. &ldquo;I was working on them. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what you wanted?&rdquo;</p><p>The man sneered at them and turned back towards the living room. He murmured something under his breath, surely nothing kind, and left. Normally Dan would say something, tell him not to be a homophobic piece of shit, but she didn&rsquo;t have it in her tonight. It felt like the little spark that was usually in her was dimmed beyond repair.</p><p>She glanced at her unlikely hero, still standing there and apparently waiting to make a drink, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for that,&rdquo; Dan said quietly, giving her a small smile.</p><p>She waved her hand nonchalantly. &ldquo;No problem. Guys like that are the worst.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Dan wanted to say more, but she was unsure if it would be appropriate to try and make conversation with someone who had literally just kept her from being hit on.</p><p>Dan realized she hadn&rsquo;t said or done anything in about five seconds, instead just standing there staring at the stranger, and she shook her head to clear her thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get out of your way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, please, Ms. Bartender, will you make me a drink, too?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan chuckled a little and nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you drinking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Malibu and Coke, please,&rdquo; she answered, giving Dan a wide smile and making her breath catch a little.</p><p>Dan tried to focus on making a decent drink, not wanting this kind stranger to be subjected to her heavy hand, and turned slightly, trying to subtly get a good look at the girl. She was pretty, but not in what was probably considered a conventional way. She was tall and a bit gangly, and the way her fingers twitched against the counter made Dan think that she probably rarely held still. Her nose was a bit big, and slightly hooked, but it looked nice, Dan thought. The black of her hair seemed a bit unnatural, especially considering how ginger her eyebrows looked, and Dan was suddenly bursting to ask if it was dyed.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said when Dan handed her the drink, taking a liberal sip.</p><p>Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do in response, so she took her own drink, almost coughing at how strong she had made it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Phil,&rdquo; the girl said, extending her free hand out to Dan.</p><p>Dan shook it, giving her a shy smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>Her hands were like silk in Dan&rsquo;s calloused hand, and before she could stop herself, she was blurting out, &ldquo;Holy shit your hands are soft.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil giggled, giving Dan&rsquo;s a little squeeze. &ldquo;I moisturize everyday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can tell.&rdquo;</p><p>God. Dan needed a muzzle sometimes. What was it about this stupidly pretty girl that was making Dan act like this was her first sip of alcohol and she had just seen a girl for the first time?</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t say anything in response, just simply tugged on their attached hands and led Dan back into the living room where she flopped onto the loveseat, pulling Dan down to sit next to her. It was crowded, and people on both sides of them were getting fairly handsy with each other, but Dan didn&rsquo;t care. She remembered when she was one of those couples, so far be it from her to get judgy about other people&rsquo;s PDA.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you go to uni at York, too?&rdquo; Phil asked, bring Dan&rsquo;s attention back to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, uh, no. I&rsquo;m up touring unis with a few of my mates and they dragged me out here. I live in Wokingham.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded &ldquo;So, what do you think about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno. Lots of geese.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed out loud, her head thumping back against the couch and her whole body shaking with laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said, wiping her eyes, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just the most accurate way you could have described it. I think I&rsquo;m developing anatidaephobia.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fear of geese?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looked a little surprised that Dan knew the actual term, but nodded, still laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;I had to Google what the word for goose phobia was when I started here. Google says it isn&rsquo;t a real thing, but apparently they&rsquo;ve never been to York during mating season.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Dan&rsquo;s turn to laugh, a boisterous noise leaving her before she could help it. Phil&rsquo;s eyes got little crinkles in the corners when she smiled, Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but notice, and her eyes were really blue. Tiny little flickers of other colors made them even prettier. Dan could feel herself start to blush, and took a long pull from her drink. The last thing she needed was to fall head over heels for a pretty girl just because she was nice to her. That usually just ended in Dan&rsquo;s heart getting broken.</p><p>That stupid fucking song started played again. Someone must have made a playlist and stuck it on there a thousand times. Probably just to annoy Dan. She made an annoyed noise and Phil gave her a confused look, likely assuming Dan was making it at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry. I just hate this song.&rdquo; She took another drink of her quickly diminishing drink and hoped Phil wouldn&rsquo;t ask why.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. Me, too. I think it&rsquo;s really overrated.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan felt defensive for about half a second, almost wanting to tell Phil off for not appreciating such a good song, but stopped herself. If she really listened to the song, she found she didn&rsquo;t <i>really</i> like it. Sam had always liked it, and that was why it became their song. Maybe that should have been a red flag. What kind of relationship is it if one person is making all the decisions and the other is just along for the ride?</p><p>&ldquo;It reminds me of someone,&rdquo; Dan said quietly. Apparently her brain had not gotten the memo that she didn&rsquo;t want to talk about.</p><p>&ldquo;An ex?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>Dan looked at her for a second before replying. Phil didn&rsquo;t look like she was asking to dig for gossip. She looked like someone who understood how shitty Dan was probably feeling, and Dan found herself nodding.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s dumb, I should be over it by now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I ask how long it&rsquo;s been?&rdquo;</p><p>They had turned toward each other at some point, maybe in an effort to put some distance between themselves and the lascivious couples next to them. It was easy for Dan to look at her over the rim of Phil&rsquo;s cup and make eye contact. There was something about those big blue eyes that made Dan feel like she could spill all her guts to this stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a month on Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not that long,&rdquo; she reassured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure the last time I went through a breakup, it took me a month just to leave my bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been rough. Shit sucks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you came out tonight! That&rsquo;s something!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t help smiling; there was something so infectious about Phil&rsquo;s smile. Maybe it was those eye crinkles, or the way she stuck her tongue out a little when her smile got too wide. Even the way her teeth were a bit crooked didn&rsquo;t take away from how cute it was.</p><p>Cute. <i>Fuck</i>, Dan thought. Having a crush on someone she didn&rsquo;t even know was not gonna do her any favors.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna go get a refill,&rdquo; she said, holding up her nearly empty cup.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looked a bit sad maybe, but Dan ignored it and stood up, although her body protested, not wanting to leave the warm and comfy couch. Especially not wanting to leave the way that Phil&rsquo;s thigh had been pressed tightly against her own the whole time they had been sat there.</p><p>Dan made a beeline to the kitchen, pouring herself another strong drink and nearly drank it all down in three gulps. She wanted to try and drink away that bit of sadness still lingering in her heart, but also the warmth that had grown there since she had started talking to Phil.</p><p>Instead of going back to the couch, Dan took a door that ended up leading to a laundry room and sat on the cold linoleum, slopping her drink a little when she moved too quickly. She pulled her phone out and clicked on the photo icon and a flood of bittersweet memories filled her screen. Her with Sam at Reading Festival last year, both their hair wild and a bit dirty, their clothes stained from the drinks and mud that had been in abundance that year.</p><p>Photos of Sam&rsquo;s birthday and the cake that Dan had attempted to bake that turned out to be a disaster of flour and icing. Sam had pretended to love it, though, cooing about how thoughtful and sweet Dan was while they choked down the almost inedible dessert.</p><p>Christmas, birthdays, mini holidays when they could get away from their parents and spend some time together. Pictures with friends, some of whom Dan didn&rsquo;t even talk to anymore because they had taken Sam&rsquo;s side when Dan&rsquo;s heart was ripped out of her chest.</p><p>She locked her phone and let her head fall back on to the washer. She should have known better than to look at the photos. They never did anything other than make her feel sad and bitter that she had spent two years with someone who had no qualms about ending it and breaking her heart.</p><p>The door to the room opened and Phil stood there, looking surprised to find Dan sitting in the dim room by herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh. Hi,&rdquo; Dan said, feeling her cheeks flush with embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Phil chuckled. She moved around Dan and took a stack of cups off of the shelf before moving back to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>Dan just shrugged. She didn&rsquo;t really know if she was or not.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you need to talk, I&rsquo;d be happy to listen.&rdquo;</p><p>Her smile was warm and genuine, and Dan thought about following her out and sitting back on the couch with her and smelling more of that fruity perfume she was wearing, but she just gave a bit of a forced smile and said thank you. Phil gave her a nod of acknowledgment and shut the door behind her.</p><p>Dan drew her legs to her chest and rested her head against her knees.</p><p>She was being a bit stupid, she knew she was. If she really thought about it, she hadn&rsquo;t even been that happy with Sam. There were more moments of tenseness and arguments then there was actual happiness. That was the problem with pictures, she thought: they only showed the happy moments, and it was easy for her to forget that things hadn&rsquo;t been good between them. Sam was selfish and a bit mean sometimes, and Dan knew deep down that she really was better off, but it still sucked. And the idea of putting herself out there, even just a little, was terrifying. What if Phil was worse than Sam was? What if Phil hurt her?</p><p><i>What if she doesn&rsquo;t, though?</i> her brain supplied.</p><p>She was stopped short by that thought. The buzz the rum was providing was enough to fuel her into action. Though she was a bit wobbly, she managed to get up off the floor and open the door to try and find Phil.</p><p>The first place she looked was the kitchen because it was closest, and because she kind of did need another drink if she was gonna do this.</p><p>Phil wasn&rsquo;t by the drinks or playing beer pong with the group of people that had gathered at the table, so Dan left to scour the living room. She didn&rsquo;t find Phil, but she did find her friends, who all yelled excitedly when she came into view.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan! Where the fuck have you been?&rdquo; Amelia slurred. Her eyes looked heavy and the stains on the front of her shirt gave a pretty good indication that she was hammered.</p><p>&ldquo;Just walking around,&rdquo; Dan said lamely, not wanting to admit she&rsquo;d been hiding in the laundry room like some sort of loser. She excused herself to go look upstairs, hoping beyond hope that she wouldn&rsquo;t find Phil upstairs with someone else.</p><p>Upstairs was clear of Phil, though Dan got more than a few eyes full of things she wished she could remove from her brain forever. She walked back downstairs slowly, feeling a bit defeated. Finding her friends again, she told them she was gonna head back to their room, not feeling like socializing anymore.</p><p>It was quiet outside, a nice reprieve from the shitty music blaring inside. Dan tucked her hands in the pockets of her hoodie and started walking in the direction of the hotel she and her friends were staying at. It was close, at least, that was something. The quiet gave her too much time to think, something she usually avoided if she could. Being left to her thoughts usually just brought her right back to being sad about things she couldn&rsquo;t change. Like being broken up with, and finding someone she thought she might like, but then balls&rsquo;ing it up because she was a coward.</p><p>As she was walking past a shabby, all night coffee shop that had adverts on the windows talking about their &lsquo;new and improved pastries,&rsquo; her stomach gave a loud gurgle, as though it could sense she was near food. She stopped in front of it, wondering if she was pathetic enough to go inside and eat by herself, but as her stomach growled again and she thought of the barren vending machines at the hotel, she decided she was.</p><p>The door was heavy and Dan was afraid it was locked at first, despite its signs that said &lsquo;open 24 hrs,&rsquo; but she pulled a little harder and it gave, making a warm burst of air hit her. It was nice, she hadn&rsquo;t been aware of how cold it had been outside, and she rubbed her hands together to gain back some warmth.</p><p>It was pretty deserted, save for the random person tucked in the corner on the couch. Dan avoided eye contact with them, not in much of a mood to interact with anyone, and moved to the counter. She ordered a pastry and a tea from the grumpy barista and stood next to the counter, fiddling with the straw she had gotten from the supply next to her.</p><p>The barista gave her the tea and sad looking pastry and she turned to look for a seat. She <i>wanted</i> to sit on the couch but it was taken, so she settled for the armchair that was a safe enough distance that it probably wouldn&rsquo;t bother the other person.</p><p>Dan took a sip from her tea, and felt her mouth instantly start to burn.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; she nearly shouted as the scalding tea dribbled down her chin. It was loud enough to grab the attention of the other patron and Dan nearly choked when she saw who it was.</p><p>Phil.</p><p>Dan almost swore again, not knowing if she felt happy to see her again, or just embarrassed. She&rsquo;d already been found looking like a sad loser once tonight, the last thing she wanted was for Phil to see her with tea running down her face and on to her hoodie.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; Phil looked surprised to see her, but happy-surprised, Dan thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Dan replied, mopping off her chin and hoodie.</p><p>&ldquo;Fancy seeing you here.&rdquo; Phil smiled at Dan, making that fuzzy feeling she had at the party return. Maybe it hadn&rsquo;t been the Malibu that had made Dan feel that.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Dan trailed off awkwardly, suddenly feeling a bit tongue-tied. &ldquo;The party was kinda boring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought so, too. Wasn&rsquo;t much fun after you left the couch.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan felt her heart start to race a bit. A smile came to her face before she had a chance to school her features, ducking her head to hide how pink her cheeks were becoming.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sorry about that. I got a bit overwhelmed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Happens to all of us.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looked up and stared for a beat, and then made a decision she didn&rsquo;t know she was considering and stood up to sit closer. She sat down on the couch, but far enough away from Phil that Dan hoped she didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;I left &lsquo;cause I couldn&rsquo;t find you to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>It felt like a bit too much to say to this virtual stranger, but as soon as Dan said it, she was happy she did. The answering smile Phil gave her made her feel like she was looking directly at the sun.</p><p>&ldquo;I was afraid I came on too strong,&rdquo; she said quietly, as if she was nervous to admit it.</p><p>Dan shook her head so hard her hair started flying about, making her try and press it back to her head to calm the curly mess.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t. Well, maybe a little bit.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s face fell a little, and Dan scrambled to correct herself. &ldquo;No, no, no! It wasn&rsquo;t like, a bad thing. I&rsquo;m just overwhelmed kind of in general right now. Talking to you was really great. Just overwhelming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, a good overwhelming?&rdquo; She sounded hopeful and it made butterflies burst in Dan&rsquo;s tummy.</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</p><p>They sat grinning at each other before both tucking their heads into their chests. It was a touch awkward, but Dan was determined to follow things through. At least that way she wouldn&rsquo;t look back on the night and regret it.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to go for a walk?&rdquo;</p><p>She was taking a chance, and though she was happy she was, a spike of anxiety went through her until Phil nodded and stood to follow her out. Dan wrapped her pastry in her napkin and stuffed it into her hoodie pouch, hunger temporarily forgotten.</p><p>Phil lead the way once they were outside, since Dan didn&rsquo;t actually have much idea where they were.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Wokingham? What&rsquo;s that like?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s breath was visible, coming out of her mouth in short puffs as she spoke.</p><p>Dan waved her hand dismissively. &ldquo;It blows. It&rsquo;s boring as fuck, and the people suck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you always lived there?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nodded. &ldquo;Hopefully not forever, though. What about you? Have you always lived in York?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shook her head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Rawtenstall. Near Manchester.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Manchester has the wheel right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replied, grinning. &ldquo;It was my favorite when I was little. I would always beg my parents to let me go on it by myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be scary?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shook her head. &ldquo;I loved it! The view was so pretty and I liked to pretend I was a grown up living by myself in Manchester. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to grow up, but now I kind of feel like I&rsquo;m still a kid. I think I&rsquo;m afraid to be an adult.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Dan understood that all too well.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna start uni right away? Or are you taking a gap year?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A gap year,&rdquo; Dan said a bit sadly.</p><p>All the plans she had for her gap year all of a sudden felt foolish and silly. Plans with Sam that she had to try and rearrange or cancel now. Plans with people who weren&rsquo;t even her friends anymore. She felt her face start to fall and tried to rearrange her features a bit to hide it, but Phil was observant and caught on.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you nervous about taking a gap year?&rdquo; She must have misinterpreted Dan&rsquo;s facial expression, and Dan thought for a second about lying, but didn&rsquo;t figure that would get her anywhere good.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I just made a bunch of plans with this person I was dating, and now I have to cancel them all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit. That sucks, I&rsquo;m sorry. Breakups suck.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan agreed, but didn&rsquo;t say much more, not ready to talk about it just yet.</p><p>They walked by a deserted park and Dan felt that impulsive urge deep inside her; she grabbed Phil&rsquo;s hand and started running towards the swings. Phil followed, laughing loudly and holding tight to Dan&rsquo;s hand. It felt nice. She missed having someone to give her affection to.</p><p>They parted to sit on the swings, and Dan felt a small pang at having to let Phil&rsquo;s hand go. Dan pushed off the ground with all her might, kicking her legs as quick as she could to help increase her speed. She pumped and pumped her legs, letting out a shriek when she realized how high she had gotten. She dragged her feet to slow down, and by the time she had nearly stopped, Phil was doubled over laughing, almost in tears.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; Dan asked, feeling a bit defensive.</p><p>&ldquo;The look on your face was so cute! You looked like you thought you were gonna fly for a second.&rdquo;</p><p>The word &lsquo;cute&rsquo; bounced around Dan&rsquo;s brain for a few seconds before she realized she hadn&rsquo;t replied.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I was going to,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;I got real scared there for a second.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could tell. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll keep you safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil reached out for Dan&rsquo;s hand and she didn&rsquo;t even hesitate before taking it. She was reminded how soft it was in her own, and rubbed her fingers against the back. Phil stared at their hands before looking up at Dan and holding her gaze.</p><p>God, her eyes were pretty. Dan was sure that if the moon was a person, they would surely be jealous of how bright Phil&rsquo;s eyes shined. She found herself getting a little lost in them, and before she knew, it they were both leaning forward and their lips met.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s lips were cold and a bit dry, though Dan was sure hers were no better, but as they leaned closer and Phil&rsquo;s parted, Dan felt a literal shock run through her. Phil felt it to, leaning back and touching her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;You shocked me,&rdquo; she laughed, fingers still pressed against them.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess you could say we have a spark.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed so hard she almost fell off her swing.</p><p>&ldquo;Too cheesy?&rdquo; Dan asked, unable to help the smile growing on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;A little bit. But cheesy&rsquo;s good, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan could use some cheesy in her life.</p>",

That&rsquo;s how long it had taken Dan to muster enough energy and desire to want to actually get out of the house for the first time in entirely too long. The persistent texts from her friends had been piling up, reminding her that her self-care was not the only thing she was neglecting these days. It was hard though; breakups sucked, especially when they were with someone who said they loved you and wanted to spend their lives with you. Yeah, it definitely sucked.</p>\n</p>",
