On the opposite end of the Kippens\u2019 couch, Amber is grinning down at her phone, a strand of golden hair twisted around her finger as she giggles at something on the screen \u2013 no doubt another text from her \u2018mystery\u2019 admirer. Cyrus simply sits there and waits, passively fiddling with the corner of his script as he waits for his friend to snap out of her crush-induced daze.<br/></p><p>Without thinking, he lets his eyes drift to the corner of the room, settling on the older boy sitting quietly in a well-worn chair, his nose buried in a book. His hair is a shade darker than Amber\u2019s, but his eyes are the same sea-foam green, with a touch of grey softening the bright hue. He\u2019s never really spoken to Amber\u2019s brother before, apart from a few pleasantries exchanged in passing, but there\u2019s something about TJ Kippen that has always intrigued him\u2026</p><p>Just then, the other boy lifts his head, as if sensing Cyrus\u2019 curious eyes. A blush warms Cyrus\u2019 cheeks as he quickly returns his attention to the script in his hands, but not quick enough to miss the hint of a smirk playing on TJ\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you almost done?\u201d he asks Amber, his words sounding sharper than intended. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees TJ go back to reading his book, and his shoulders slump in relief. \u201cSorry, I just\u2026 I\u2019ve only got a few more days to rehearse, remember? The nerves are starting to kick in.\u201d</p><p>Amber glances up from her phone, a sliver of guilt fracturing her lovesick smile. \u201cSorry, Cy. Just gimme a sec.\u201d</p><p>It takes closer to a minute than a second for Amber to finally put her phone down, but Cyrus lets it slide. At least he now has a distraction from the indecipherable looks TJ keeps sneaking him, scorching his skin and quickening his heartbeat.\u00a0</p><p>As they return to the play, Cyrus can\u2019t ignore the longing glances Amber keeps flicking at her phone. With every new text, her concentration wanes even more, her bottom lip caught between her teeth as she visibly fights the urge to throw the script across the room and pick up her phone instead. She\u2019s practically vibrating with the effort to focus, her face pinching tighter and tighter as the incoming texts start to slow down.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAmber,\u201d Cyrus says, nudging her leg with his foot. \u201cIt\u2019s your line.\u201d</p><p>She tears her eyes away from the phone, now blessedly silent, and shakes her head. \u201cSorry\u2026 Where are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPage 14. Line 38.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d She slides a finger down the script, her brow furrowed as she searches for the right line. A few seconds later, she clears her throat and falls back into character. \u201c<i>Thomas</i>,\u201d she says, her voice slightly higher than usual. \u201c<i>I thought you\u2019d never</i> \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Cyrus cuts her off. \u201cWrong line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smooths his face and lifts an eyebrow, his breath catching on the edge of a sigh. \u201cUnless we skipped ahead to the final scene without me realising, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the wrong line.\u201d</p><p>Across the room, TJ snorts, an amused smile nicking the corner of his mouth as he meets Cyrus\u2019 eyes. For a brief moment, something warm and sweet blossoms in his chest, but it\u2019s quickly cooled by the sudden ringing of Amber\u2019s phone. He shoots a glare at his friend, silently warning her not to pick it up, but it\u2019s no use.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Amber says, shrugging helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s Andi. I <i>have </i>to answer!\u201d Before Cyrus can protest, she throws her script at TJ and picks up her phone, already halfway up the stairs. \u201cRun lines with Cyrus until I\u2019m back, okay?\u201d</p><p>TJ frowns. \u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>A flirtatious giggle floats down the stairs in her wake, followed by the sound of her bedroom door closing. Once she\u2019s gone, an awkward silence settles over the room. Cyrus looks over at TJ, his stomach churning as the older boy studies the script now lying in his lap, and forces a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really have to run lines with me,\u201d he says, twisting his hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait until she\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>TJ scoffs. \u201cThat could be a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He huffs a laugh, then sighs. \u201cMaybe I should just go\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you only had a few days to rehearse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus says, his heart skipping at the notion of TJ paying attention to what he was saying. \u201cBut I can do that by myself. Or I\u2019ll ask my mom to help.\u201d He winces, realising too late how lame that must sound. \u201c<i>Or</i> one of my many friends.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckles, and the sound sends a pleasant shiver down his spine, soothing the aching burn of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLet me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cScooch over,\u201d TJ says, gently slapping Cyrus\u2019 outstretched legs with his script as he sits down on the couch. When he\u2019s comfortable, he licks his finger and flips through the pages. \u201cPage 14, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallows thickly. \u201cUm\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess I\u2019m\u2026 Alice?\u201d</p><p>A nervous laugh bubbles in his chest. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d TJ insists.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201c100%.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus hesitates, then breathes a sigh as he settles down and reopens his script. \u201cOkay then\u2026 I\u2019ll start from the top.\u201d He coughs to clear his throat, flicking an anxious glance at TJ, and starts to read. \u201c<i>I think we need to talk, Alice</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>About what</i>?\u201d TJ says, a feminine twinge to his voice.</p><p>Cyrus fights back a smile and keeps reading.</p><p>They run through the scene fluidly, only stopping to turn pages and share secret smiles over the tops of their scripts. As Thomas confesses his undying love for Alice, and the tone of the play takes a turn into sappy territory, Cyrus feels himself flushing darkly, his voice turning tight and raspy as the two characters begin tossing flirtatious comments at each other.</p><p>\u201cWho wrote this play?\u201d TJ asks on the cusp of a laugh, his own cheeks turning pink. \u201cIt\u2019s very, uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t gonna say it that bluntly, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorts. \u201cA few of the girls in my group are Jane Austen wannabes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus scratches the back of his head, the smile slowly dying on his lips as he skims through the upcoming pages of groan-worthy dialogue. \u201cWe can stop if you want.\u201d</p><p>TJ snaps his head up. \u201cWhat? No! It\u2019s just starting to get juicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it was terrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Across the room, the discarded book lying on the chair TJ was previously sitting in catches his eye, and a teasing grin spreads across his face. There\u2019s a cheesy stock photo of two women in old-fashioned dresses strolling through a park on the cover, with tiny umbrellas held above their bonneted heads.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, folding his arms with a quirk of an eyebrow. \u201cI see\u2026 You\u2019re a Jane Austen wannabe, too.\u201d</p><p>TJ blushes. \u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not judging!\u201d</p><p>When TJ sees him smirking, he breaks into a smile of his own, playfully kicking Cyrus in the shin as readjusts himself on the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEager, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus wipes the grin off his face, despite the butterflies still fluttering in his stomach, and tries to focus on the poorly-written script in his hands. They dive back into flirty banter \u2013 Austen\u00a0style \u2013 all the while stealing glances at each other, their lips twitching with barely supressed laughter. It\u2019s only when the scene shifts from light to serious that Cyrus feels his palms beginning to sweat.</p><p>\u201c<i>You look beautiful in the moonlight</i>,\u201d he says, his voice trembling. Even though the words aren\u2019t directed at TJ, he can still hear his heart pounding against his ribcage as he risks a glance at the other boy, trying to gauge his reaction. \u201c<i>You look beautiful in all lights, of course, but this is different.</i>\u201d</p><p>TJ licks his lips. \u201c<i>Different how</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Your hair shines</i>,\u201d Cyrus says, his voice a whisper. \u201c<i>Your eyes twinkle like starlight. Your skin glows.</i>\u201d He lifts his head, eyes drifting to TJ\u2019s face once again. His gaze is fixed resolutely on his script, but Cyrus can see the blush creeping up his neck, the ripple of his throat as he swallows, the slight furrow between his brows, the silent murmur of his lips as he follows Cyrus\u2019 lines on the page\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>TJ freezes, his mouth falling open, and Cyrus realises his mistake: that line isn\u2019t in the script.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d The words die in his throat. He gulps back his embarrassment and tries again, his face starting to burn. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know where that came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a little carried away, you know?\u201d Cyrus closes his script and gets to his feet, desperately searching for his bag beneath the coffee table. \u201cI think I should go now. Thanks for helping me and everything\u2026 I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>TJ reaches for his arm, but Cyrus shakes him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making things weird,\u201d he says, tears of humiliation stinging the backs of his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Amber told you, but I\u2019m gay. Not that you care.\u201d He laughs, completely mortified. \u201cWow. I just came out to a guy I barely know. This is just getting better and better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>When TJ reaches for him a second time, he doesn\u2019t miss. His fingers are gentle, but his grip is firm, and he doesn\u2019t take his eyes off Cyrus\u2019 face as he slowly lowers him back onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he says, giving his arm a quick squeeze before letting go. A blinding smile breaks across his face when Cyrus finally meets his eyes. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m mad at you for calling me gorgeous, then I must be worse at this than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been flirting with you for the past half an hour, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I guess I really <i>am </i>bad at this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shakes his head, trying to steady his racing thoughts. \u201cAre you saying you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have for a while,\u201d TJ admits, shrugging bashfully. \u201cI know we\u2019ve never really talked, but\u2026 I\u2019ve seen you around. And you hang out with my sister a lot.\u201d He huffs, one side of his mouth lifting in a crooked smile. \u201cWhy do you think I always stay downstairs when you come over? I like being around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cyrus says, a touch breathless. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The tension in TJ\u2019s shoulders melts away as Cyrus returns a tentative smile of his own. For a moment, they just sit there, smiling shyly at each on the middle of the couch, their knees deliberately brushing against each other.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d TJ says after a while, his fingers nervously drumming the cool leather between them. \u201cI was thinking\u2026 Maybe we could \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Amber announces as she bounces down the stairs, her cheeks rosy from her conversation with Andi. When she notices TJ and Cyrus sitting so close, she stalls on the bottom step, her smile morphing into a scowl as she narrows her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Cyrus squeaks, accidentally throwing his script in the air and hitting TJ on the head. He cringes, hiding his face in his hands, and splutters an apology. \u201cOh no! I\u2019m so sorry, TJ! Are you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>TJ rubs the back of his head and chuckles. \u201cI think I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go upstairs now,\u201d Amber says, glaring pointedly at her brother. \u201cWe have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes and gets to his feet, shoving his script into Amber\u2019s hands. He picks up his cheesy Victorian novel and heads towards the stairs, only stopping to cast a gentle smile over his shoulder at Cyrus. \u201cGood luck with the play,\u201d he says, ignoring the daggers Amber is shooting at the side of his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chews his lip and shrugs. \u201cYou could come, you know? The tickets are all sold out, but I could sneak you in.\u201d He blushes, immediately doubting himself. \u201cOnly if you want to, of course. I mean, the script is pretty terrible, and I\u2019m not exactly the greatest actor in the world, so you really don\u2019t have to \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d TJ cuts in with another smile, offering him a wink before turning around and disappearing up the stairs.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, Amber throws herself onto the couch and punches Cyrus in the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to have a crush on my brother, okay? That goes against the rules of friendship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have <i>way</i> too many rules,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cAnd, besides\u2026 You\u2019ve been flirting with my best friend all afternoon, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>Amber opens her mouth to protest, then freezes, a groan escaping her lips. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you <i>do </i>admit you have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glances at the staircase, the frantic beating of his heart still echoing in his ears as a nervous grin tugs at his lips. \u201cYeah\u2026 I think I do.\u201d</p><p><i>The End.</i></p><p>~~~~~</p><p><i>You can find the rest of my Tyrus fics on <a href=\"https://seraph-novak.tumblr.com/tagged/tyrus%20fics\">Tumblr </a>or <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/series/1113210\">AO3</a>!

As Thomas confesses his undying love for Alice, and the tone of the play takes a turn into sappy territory, Cyrus feels himself flushing darkly, his voice turning tight and raspy as the two characters begin tossing flirtatious comments at each other.</p><p>\u201cWho wrote this play?\u201d TJ asks on the cusp of a laugh, his own cheeks turning pink. \u201cIt\u2019s very, uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t gonna say it that bluntly, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorts. \u201cA few of the girls in my group are Jane Austen wannabes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus scratches the back of his head, the smile slowly dying on his lips as he skims through the upcoming pages of groan-worthy dialogue. \u201cWe can stop if you want.\u201d</p><p>TJ snaps his head up. \u201cWhat? No! It\u2019s just starting to get juicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it was terrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>Across the room, the discarded book lying on the chair TJ was previously sitting in catches his eye, and a teasing grin spreads across his face. There\u2019s a cheesy stock photo of two women in old-fashioned dresses strolling through a park on the cover, with tiny umbrellas held above their bonneted heads.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, folding his arms with a quirk of an eyebrow. \u201cI see\u2026 You\u2019re a Jane Austen wannabe, too.\u201d</p><p>TJ blushes. \u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not judging!\u201d</p><p>When TJ sees him smirking, he breaks into a smile of his own, playfully kicking Cyrus in the shin as readjusts himself on the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEager, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus wipes the grin off his face, despite the butterflies still fluttering in his stomach, and tries to focus on the poorly-written script in his hands. They dive back into flirty banter \u2013 Austen\u00a0style \u2013 all the while stealing glances at each other, their lips twitching with barely supressed laughter. It\u2019s only when the scene shifts from light to serious that Cyrus feels his palms beginning to sweat.</p><p>\u201c<i>You look beautiful in the moonlight</i>,\u201d he says, his voice trembling. Even though the words aren\u2019t directed at TJ, he can still hear his heart pounding against his ribcage as he risks a glance at the other boy, trying to gauge his reaction. \u201c<i>You look beautiful in all lights, of course, but this is different.</i>\u201d</p><p>TJ licks his lips. \u201c<i>Different how</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Your hair shines</i>,\u201d Cyrus says, his voice a whisper. \u201c<i>Your eyes twinkle like starlight. Your skin glows.</i>\u201d He lifts his head, eyes drifting to TJ\u2019s face once again. His gaze is fixed resolutely on his script, but Cyrus can see the blush creeping up his neck, the ripple of his throat as he swallows, the slight furrow between his brows, the silent murmur of his lips as he follows Cyrus\u2019 lines on the page\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>TJ freezes, his mouth falling open, and Cyrus realises his mistake: that line isn\u2019t in the script.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d The words die in his throat. He gulps back his embarrassment and tries again, his face starting to burn. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know where that came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a little carried away, you know?\u201d Cyrus closes his script and gets to his feet, desperately searching for his bag beneath the coffee table. \u201cI think I should go now. Thanks for helping me and everything\u2026 I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>TJ reaches for his arm, but Cyrus shakes him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making things weird,\u201d he says, tears of humiliation stinging the backs of his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Amber told you, but I\u2019m gay. Not that you care.\u201d He laughs, completely mortified. \u201cWow. I just came out to a guy I barely know. This is just getting better and better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>When TJ reaches for him a second time, he doesn\u2019t miss. His fingers are gentle, but his grip is firm, and he doesn\u2019t take his eyes off Cyrus\u2019 face as he slowly lowers him back onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he says, giving his arm a quick squeeze before letting go. A blinding smile breaks across his face when Cyrus finally meets his eyes. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m mad at you for calling me gorgeous, then I must be worse at this than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been flirting with you for the past half an hour, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I guess I really <i>am </i>bad at this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shakes his head, trying to steady his racing thoughts. \u201cAre you saying you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have for a while,\u201d TJ admits, shrugging bashfully. \u201cI know we\u2019ve never really talked, but\u2026 I\u2019ve seen you around. And you hang out with my sister a lot.\u201d He huffs, one side of his mouth lifting in a crooked smile. \u201cWhy do you think I always stay downstairs when you come over? I like being around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cyrus says, a touch breathless. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The tension in TJ\u2019s shoulders melts away as Cyrus returns a tentative smile of his own. For a moment, they just sit there, smiling shyly at each on the middle of the couch, their knees deliberately brushing against each other.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d TJ says after a while, his fingers nervously drumming the cool leather between them. \u201cI was thinking\u2026 Maybe we could \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Amber announces as she bounces down the stairs, her cheeks rosy from her conversation with Andi. When she notices TJ and Cyrus sitting so close, she stalls on the bottom step, her smile morphing into a scowl as she narrows her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Cyrus squeaks, accidentally throwing his script in the air and hitting TJ on the head. He cringes, hiding his face in his hands, and splutters an apology. \u201cOh no! I\u2019m so sorry, TJ! Are you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>TJ rubs the back of his head and chuckles. \u201cI think I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go upstairs now,\u201d Amber says, glaring pointedly at her brother. \u201cWe have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes and gets to his feet, shoving his script into Amber\u2019s hands. He picks up his cheesy Victorian novel and heads towards the stairs, only stopping to cast a gentle smile over his shoulder at Cyrus. \u201cGood luck with the play,\u201d he says, ignoring the daggers Amber is shooting at the side of his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chews his lip and shrugs. \u201cYou could come, you know? The tickets are all sold out, but I could sneak you in.\u201d He blushes, immediately doubting himself. \u201cOnly if you want to, of course. I mean, the script is pretty terrible, and I\u2019m not exactly the greatest actor in the world, so you really don\u2019t have to \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d TJ cuts in with another smile, offering him a wink before turning around and disappearing up the stairs.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, Amber throws herself onto the couch and punches Cyrus in the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to have a crush on my brother, okay? That goes against the rules of friendship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have <i>way</i> too many rules,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cAnd, besides\u2026 You\u2019ve been flirting with my best friend all afternoon, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>Amber opens her mouth to protest, then freezes, a groan escaping her lips. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you <i>do </i>admit you have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glances at the staircase, the frantic beating of his heart still echoing in his ears as a nervous grin tugs at his lips. \u201cYeah\u2026 I think I do.\u201d</p><p><i>The End.</i></p><p>~~~~~</p><p><i>You can find the rest of my Tyrus fics on <a href=\"https://seraph-novak.tumblr.com/tagged/tyrus%20fics\">Tumblr </a>or <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/series/1113210\">AO3</a>!

Thank you!<br></i></p><p><i>\n\nAlso available on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17855705\">AO3</a>\u00a0\u2665</i><br></p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Cyrus is quickly losing his patience. On the opposite end of the Kippens\u2019 couch, Amber is grinning down at her phone, a strand of golden hair twisted around her finger as she giggles at something on the screen \u2013 no doubt another text from her \u2018mystery\u2019 admirer. Cyrus simply sits there and waits, passively fiddling with the corner of his script as he waits for his friend to snap out of her crush-induced daze.<br></p><p>Without thinking, he lets his eyes drift to the corner of the room, settling on the older boy sitting quietly in a well-worn chair, his nose buried in a book. His hair is a shade darker than Amber\u2019s, but his eyes are the same sea-foam green, with a touch of grey softening the bright hue. He\u2019s never really spoken to Amber\u2019s brother before, apart from a few pleasantries exchanged in passing, but there\u2019s something about TJ Kippen that has always intrigued him\u2026</p><p>Just then, the other boy lifts his head, as if sensing Cyrus\u2019 curious eyes. A blush warms Cyrus\u2019 cheeks as he quickly returns his attention to the script in his hands, but not quick enough to miss the hint of a smirk playing on TJ\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you almost done?\u201d he asks Amber, his words sounding sharper than intended. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees TJ go back to reading his book, and his shoulders slump in relief. \u201cSorry, I just\u2026 I\u2019ve only got a few more days to rehearse, remember? The nerves are starting to kick in.\u201d</p><p>Amber glances up from her phone, a sliver of guilt fracturing her lovesick smile. \u201cSorry, Cy. Just gimme a sec.\u201d</p><p>It takes closer to a minute than a second for Amber to finally put her phone down, but Cyrus lets it slide. At least he now has a distraction from the indecipherable looks TJ keeps sneaking him, scorching his skin and quickening his heartbeat.\u00a0</p><p>As they return to the play, Cyrus can\u2019t ignore the longing glances Amber keeps flicking at her phone. With every new text, her concentration wanes even more, her bottom lip caught between her teeth as she visibly fights the urge to throw the script across the room and pick up her phone instead. She\u2019s practically vibrating with the effort to focus, her face pinching tighter and tighter as the incoming texts start to slow down.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAmber,\u201d Cyrus says, nudging her leg with his foot. \u201cIt\u2019s your line.\u201d</p><p>She tears her eyes away from the phone, now blessedly silent, and shakes her head. \u201cSorry\u2026 Where are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPage 14. Line 38.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d She slides a finger down the script, her brow furrowed as she searches for the right line. A few seconds later, she clears her throat and falls back into character. \u201c<i>Thomas</i>,\u201d she says, her voice slightly higher than usual. \u201c<i>I thought you\u2019d never</i> \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Cyrus cuts her off. \u201cWrong line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smooths his face and lifts an eyebrow, his breath catching on the edge of a sigh. \u201cUnless we skipped ahead to the final scene without me realising, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the wrong line.\u201d</p><p>Across the room, TJ snorts, an amused smile nicking the corner of his mouth as he meets Cyrus\u2019 eyes. For a brief moment, something warm and sweet blossoms in his chest, but it\u2019s quickly cooled by the sudden ringing of Amber\u2019s phone. He shoots a glare at his friend, silently warning her not to pick it up, but it\u2019s no use.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Amber says, shrugging helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s Andi. I <i>have </i>to answer!\u201d Before Cyrus can protest, she throws her script at TJ and picks up her phone, already halfway up the stairs. \u201cRun lines with Cyrus until I\u2019m back, okay?\u201d</p><p>TJ frowns. \u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>A flirtatious giggle floats down the stairs in her wake, followed by the sound of her bedroom door closing. Once she\u2019s gone, an awkward silence settles over the room. Cyrus looks over at TJ, his stomach churning as the older boy studies the script now lying in his lap, and forces a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really have to run lines with me,\u201d he says, twisting his hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait until she\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>TJ scoffs. \u201cThat could be a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He huffs a laugh, then sighs. \u201cMaybe I should just go\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you only had a few days to rehearse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Cyrus says, his heart skipping at the notion of TJ paying attention to what he was saying. \u201cBut I can do that by myself. Or I\u2019ll ask my mom to help.\u201d He winces, realising too late how lame that must sound. \u201c<i>Or</i> one of my many friends.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckles, and the sound sends a pleasant shiver down his spine, soothing the aching burn of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLet me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cScooch over,\u201d TJ says, gently slapping Cyrus\u2019 outstretched legs with his script as he sits down on the couch. When he\u2019s comfortable, he licks his finger and flips through the pages. \u201cPage 14, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallows thickly. \u201cUm\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess I\u2019m\u2026 Alice?\u201d</p><p>A nervous laugh bubbles in his chest. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d TJ insists.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201c100%.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus hesitates, then breathes a sigh as he settles down and reopens his script. \u201cOkay then\u2026 I\u2019ll start from the top.\u201d He coughs to clear his throat, flicking an anxious glance at TJ, and starts to read. \u201c<i>I think we need to talk, Alice</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>About what</i>?\u201d TJ says, a feminine twinge to his voice.</p><p>Cyrus fights back a smile and keeps reading.</p><p>They run through the scene fluidly, only stopping to turn pages and share secret smiles over the tops of their scripts. As Thomas confesses his undying love for Alice, and the tone of the play takes a turn into sappy territory, Cyrus feels himself flushing darkly, his voice turning tight and raspy as the two characters begin tossing flirtatious comments at each other.</p><p>\u201cWho wrote this play?\u201d TJ asks on the cusp of a laugh, his own cheeks turning pink. \u201cIt\u2019s very, uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t gonna say it that bluntly, but yeah.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorts. \u201cA few of the girls in my group are Jane Austen wannabes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cyrus scratches the back of his head, the smile slowly dying on his lips as he skims through the upcoming pages of groan-worthy dialogue. \u201cWe can stop if you want.\u201d</p><p>TJ snaps his head up. \u201cWhat?

They dive back into flirty banter \u2013 Austen\u00a0style \u2013 all the while stealing glances at each other, their lips twitching with barely supressed laughter. It\u2019s only when the scene shifts from light to serious that Cyrus feels his palms beginning to sweat.</p><p>\u201c<i>You look beautiful in the moonlight</i>,\u201d he says, his voice trembling. Even though the words aren\u2019t directed at TJ, he can still hear his heart pounding against his ribcage as he risks a glance at the other boy, trying to gauge his reaction. \u201c<i>You look beautiful in all lights, of course, but this is different.</i>\u201d</p><p>TJ licks his lips. \u201c<i>Different how</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Your hair shines</i>,\u201d Cyrus says, his voice a whisper. \u201c<i>Your eyes twinkle like starlight. Your skin glows.</i>\u201d He lifts his head, eyes drifting to TJ\u2019s face once again. His gaze is fixed resolutely on his script, but Cyrus can see the blush creeping up his neck, the ripple of his throat as he swallows, the slight furrow between his brows, the silent murmur of his lips as he follows Cyrus\u2019 lines on the page\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>TJ freezes, his mouth falling open, and Cyrus realises his mistake: that line isn\u2019t in the script.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d The words die in his throat. He gulps back his embarrassment and tries again, his face starting to burn. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2026 I-I don\u2019t know where that came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a little carried away, you know?\u201d Cyrus closes his script and gets to his feet, desperately searching for his bag beneath the coffee table. \u201cI think I should go now. Thanks for helping me and everything\u2026 I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>TJ reaches for his arm, but Cyrus shakes him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making things weird,\u201d he says, tears of humiliation stinging the backs of his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Amber told you, but I\u2019m gay. Not that you care.\u201d He laughs, completely mortified. \u201cWow. I just came out to a guy I barely know. This is just getting better and better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>When TJ reaches for him a second time, he doesn\u2019t miss. His fingers are gentle, but his grip is firm, and he doesn\u2019t take his eyes off Cyrus\u2019 face as he slowly lowers him back onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he says, giving his arm a quick squeeze before letting go. A blinding smile breaks across his face when Cyrus finally meets his eyes. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m mad at you for calling me gorgeous, then I must be worse at this than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been flirting with you for the past half an hour, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I guess I really <i>am </i>bad at this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shakes his head, trying to steady his racing thoughts. \u201cAre you saying you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have for a while,\u201d TJ admits, shrugging bashfully. \u201cI know we\u2019ve never really talked, but\u2026 I\u2019ve seen you around. And you hang out with my sister a lot.\u201d He huffs, one side of his mouth lifting in a crooked smile. \u201cWhy do you think I always stay downstairs when you come over? I like being around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cyrus says, a touch breathless. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The tension in TJ\u2019s shoulders melts away as Cyrus returns a tentative smile of his own. For a moment, they just sit there, smiling shyly at each on the middle of the couch, their knees deliberately brushing against each other.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d TJ says after a while, his fingers nervously drumming the cool leather between them. \u201cI was thinking\u2026 Maybe we could \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Amber announces as she bounces down the stairs, her cheeks rosy from her conversation with Andi. When she notices TJ and Cyrus sitting so close, she stalls on the bottom step, her smile morphing into a scowl as she narrows her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Cyrus squeaks, accidentally throwing his script in the air and hitting TJ on the head. He cringes, hiding his face in his hands, and splutters an apology. \u201cOh no! I\u2019m so sorry, TJ! Are you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>TJ rubs the back of his head and chuckles. \u201cI think I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go upstairs now,\u201d Amber says, glaring pointedly at her brother. \u201cWe have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes and gets to his feet, shoving his script into Amber\u2019s hands. He picks up his cheesy Victorian novel and heads towards the stairs, only stopping to cast a gentle smile over his shoulder at Cyrus. \u201cGood luck with the play,\u201d he says, ignoring the daggers Amber is shooting at the side of his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus chews his lip and shrugs. \u201cYou could come, you know? The tickets are all sold out, but I could sneak you in.\u201d He blushes, immediately doubting himself. \u201cOnly if you want to, of course. I mean, the script is pretty terrible, and I\u2019m not exactly the greatest actor in the world, so you really don\u2019t have to \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d TJ cuts in with another smile, offering him a wink before turning around and disappearing up the stairs.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s gone, Amber throws herself onto the couch and punches Cyrus in the arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to have a crush on my brother, okay? That goes against the rules of friendship!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have <i>way</i> too many rules,\u201d Cyrus says. \u201cAnd, besides\u2026 You\u2019ve been flirting with my best friend all afternoon, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>Amber opens her mouth to protest, then freezes, a groan escaping her lips. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you <i>do </i>admit you have a crush on him?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus glances at the staircase, the frantic beating of his heart still echoing in his ears as a nervous grin tugs at his lips. \u201cYeah\u2026 I think I do.\u201d</p><p><i>The End.</i></p><p>~~~~~</p><p><i>You can find the rest of my Tyrus fics on <a href=\"https://seraph-novak.tumblr.com/tagged/tyrus%20fics\">Tumblr </a>or <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/series/1113210\">AO3</a>!

Thank you!<br /></i></p><p><i>\n\nAlso available on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17855705\">AO3</a>&nbsp;&hearts;</i><br /></p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Cyrus is quickly losing his patience. On the opposite end of the Kippens&rsquo; couch, Amber is grinning down at her phone, a strand of golden hair twisted around her finger as she giggles at something on the screen &ndash; no doubt another text from her &lsquo;mystery&rsquo; admirer. Cyrus simply sits there and waits, passively fiddling with the corner of his script as he waits for his friend to snap out of her crush-induced daze.<br /></p><p>Without thinking, he lets his eyes drift to the corner of the room, settling on the older boy sitting quietly in a well-worn chair, his nose buried in a book. His hair is a shade darker than Amber&rsquo;s, but his eyes are the same sea-foam green, with a touch of grey softening the bright hue. He&rsquo;s never really spoken to Amber&rsquo;s brother before, apart from a few pleasantries exchanged in passing, but there&rsquo;s something about TJ Kippen that has always intrigued him&hellip;</p><p>Just then, the other boy lifts his head, as if sensing Cyrus&rsquo; curious eyes. A blush warms Cyrus&rsquo; cheeks as he quickly returns his attention to the script in his hands, but not quick enough to miss the hint of a smirk playing on TJ&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you almost done?&rdquo; he asks Amber, his words sounding sharper than intended. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees TJ go back to reading his book, and his shoulders slump in relief. &ldquo;Sorry, I just&hellip; I&rsquo;ve only got a few more days to rehearse, remember? The nerves are starting to kick in.&rdquo;</p><p>Amber glances up from her phone, a sliver of guilt fracturing her lovesick smile. &ldquo;Sorry, Cy. Just gimme a sec.&rdquo;</p><p>It takes closer to a minute than a second for Amber to finally put her phone down, but Cyrus lets it slide. At least he now has a distraction from the indecipherable looks TJ keeps sneaking him, scorching his skin and quickening his heartbeat.&nbsp;</p><p>As they return to the play, Cyrus can&rsquo;t ignore the longing glances Amber keeps flicking at her phone. With every new text, her concentration wanes even more, her bottom lip caught between her teeth as she visibly fights the urge to throw the script across the room and pick up her phone instead. She&rsquo;s practically vibrating with the effort to focus, her face pinching tighter and tighter as the incoming texts start to slow down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Amber,&rdquo; Cyrus says, nudging her leg with his foot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your line.&rdquo;</p><p>She tears her eyes away from the phone, now blessedly silent, and shakes her head. &ldquo;Sorry&hellip; Where are we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Page 14. Line 38.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo; She slides a finger down the script, her brow furrowed as she searches for the right line. A few seconds later, she clears her throat and falls back into character. &ldquo;<i>Thomas</i>,&rdquo; she says, her voice slightly higher than usual. &ldquo;<i>I thought you&rsquo;d never</i> &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Cyrus cuts her off. &ldquo;Wrong line.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smooths his face and lifts an eyebrow, his breath catching on the edge of a sigh. &ldquo;Unless we skipped ahead to the final scene without me realising, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s the wrong line.&rdquo;</p><p>Across the room, TJ snorts, an amused smile nicking the corner of his mouth as he meets Cyrus&rsquo; eyes. For a brief moment, something warm and sweet blossoms in his chest, but it&rsquo;s quickly cooled by the sudden ringing of Amber&rsquo;s phone. He shoots a glare at his friend, silently warning her not to pick it up, but it&rsquo;s no use.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; Amber says, shrugging helplessly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Andi. I <i>have </i>to answer!&rdquo; Before Cyrus can protest, she throws her script at TJ and picks up her phone, already halfway up the stairs. &ldquo;Run lines with Cyrus until I&rsquo;m back, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ frowns. &ldquo;But &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>A flirtatious giggle floats down the stairs in her wake, followed by the sound of her bedroom door closing. Once she&rsquo;s gone, an awkward silence settles over the room. Cyrus looks over at TJ, his stomach churning as the older boy studies the script now lying in his lap, and forces a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really have to run lines with me,&rdquo; he says, twisting his hands together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just wait until she&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ scoffs. &ldquo;That could be a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He huffs a laugh, then sighs. &ldquo;Maybe I should just go&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said you only had a few days to rehearse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Cyrus says, his heart skipping at the notion of TJ paying attention to what he was saying. &ldquo;But I can do that by myself. Or I&rsquo;ll ask my mom to help.&rdquo; He winces, realising too late how lame that must sound. &ldquo;<i>Or</i> one of my many friends.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckles, and the sound sends a pleasant shiver down his spine, soothing the aching burn of his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; You don&rsquo;t have to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scooch over,&rdquo; TJ says, gently slapping Cyrus&rsquo; outstretched legs with his script as he sits down on the couch. When he&rsquo;s comfortable, he licks his finger and flips through the pages. &ldquo;Page 14, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus swallows thickly. &ldquo;Um&hellip; Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Thomas?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, I guess I&rsquo;m&hellip; Alice?&rdquo;</p><p>A nervous laugh bubbles in his chest. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; TJ insists.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;100%.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus hesitates, then breathes a sigh as he settles down and reopens his script. &ldquo;Okay then&hellip; I&rsquo;ll start from the top.&rdquo; He coughs to clear his throat, flicking an anxious glance at TJ, and starts to read. &ldquo;<i>I think we need to talk, Alice</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>About what</i>?&rdquo; TJ says, a feminine twinge to his voice.</p><p>Cyrus fights back a smile and keeps reading.</p><p>They run through the scene fluidly, only stopping to turn pages and share secret smiles over the tops of their scripts. As Thomas confesses his undying love for Alice, and the tone of the play takes a turn into sappy territory, Cyrus feels himself flushing darkly, his voice turning tight and raspy as the two characters begin tossing flirtatious comments at each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Who wrote this play?&rdquo; TJ asks on the cusp of a laugh, his own cheeks turning pink. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very, uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Terrible?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t gonna say it that bluntly, but yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus snorts. &ldquo;A few of the girls in my group are Jane Austen wannabes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yikes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Cyrus scratches the back of his head, the smile slowly dying on his lips as he skims through the upcoming pages of groan-worthy dialogue. &ldquo;We can stop if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ snaps his head up. &ldquo;What? No! It&rsquo;s just starting to get juicy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said it was terrible?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Across the room, the discarded book lying on the chair TJ was previously sitting in catches his eye, and a teasing grin spreads across his face. There&rsquo;s a cheesy stock photo of two women in old-fashioned dresses strolling through a park on the cover, with tiny umbrellas held above their bonneted heads.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says, folding his arms with a quirk of an eyebrow. &ldquo;I see&hellip; You&rsquo;re a Jane Austen wannabe, too.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ blushes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my mom&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m not judging!&rdquo;</p><p>When TJ sees him smirking, he breaks into a smile of his own, playfully kicking Cyrus in the shin as readjusts himself on the couch. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eager, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha-ha.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus wipes the grin off his face, despite the butterflies still fluttering in his stomach, and tries to focus on the poorly-written script in his hands. They dive back into flirty banter &ndash; Austen&nbsp;style &ndash; all the while stealing glances at each other, their lips twitching with barely supressed laughter. It&rsquo;s only when the scene shifts from light to serious that Cyrus feels his palms beginning to sweat.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You look beautiful in the moonlight</i>,&rdquo; he says, his voice trembling.

His gaze is fixed resolutely on his script, but Cyrus can see the blush creeping up his neck, the ripple of his throat as he swallows, the slight furrow between his brows, the silent murmur of his lips as he follows Cyrus&rsquo; lines on the page&hellip; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely gorgeous.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ freezes, his mouth falling open, and Cyrus realises his mistake: that line isn&rsquo;t in the script.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; The words die in his throat. He gulps back his embarrassment and tries again, his face starting to burn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I just&hellip; I-I don&rsquo;t know where that came from.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got a little carried away, you know?&rdquo; Cyrus closes his script and gets to his feet, desperately searching for his bag beneath the coffee table. &ldquo;I think I should go now.

Instagram stans might be another story but they\u2019re all like 9 and nobody claims them. But yeah. No. Tyrus is very special actually because it\u2019s one of the few same-sex teenage ships in the history of gay representation that isn\u2019t sexualized, and because of that most fans don\u2019t sexualize it either. I have seen some borderline-fetishized behavior from some fans about certain actors or characters or ships but it\u2019s very rare, usually not done by cishet girls, and definitely does not represent the majority of the fans. I would guess that any fans of The Lodge who are saying this are probably just bitter because of the attention Cyrus has gotten for being a gay character while theirs kind of just got written off the show or whatever and never made international headlines but yeah idk.

If they never did a parental coming out scene, I could see them doing a meeting the parents situation. I think we could probably expect some further exploration of Judaism involving sexuality, since two of his Big Gay Episodes have involved Jewish traditions. I think we could expect her to keep fighting for a kiss to happen between them. I think we would probably see some casual group dates, and maybe some cliche nervous stuff surrounding that - but probably with a twist knowing Terri.\u00a0</p><p>But with that being said, I don\u2019t think they would ever be treated quite the same as the straight ships on the show because she has to use whatever screen time they gets to teach the lessons she needs to teach. So I don\u2019t think they would have much drama surrounding the relationship itself like we\u2019ve seen with Buffy and Andi\u2019s relationships - and that\u2019s a good thing because we don\u2019t need to see the ups and downs in Tyrus. That\u2019s why I always talk about how I would like for them to mainly just <i>exist </i>and be healthy and happy together without much internal fights between the two of them or anything like that.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah. I don\u2019t think they would be pushed entirely to the background, but I don\u2019t think the relationship itself would be a central focus of the show. But at this point it would just heavily rely on what Disney would allow yk. There\u2019s really no way of knowing, and little point in theorizing lmao.</p>",
