You quickly got the feeling of comfort.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be ok darling. I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo; Tom whispers in your ear, which gives you chills.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t deserve your amazing and caring boyfriend. He was always supporting you and making you feel comfortable in every situation. He was the best thing that could happen to you.</p><p>All you did was close your eyes and take a deep breath, leaning your head against his shoulder. As everyone were almost ready in their positions, you and Tom got ready too. He reached for the rope as he squatted, for you to sit on his lap. You soon placed your hands around his shoulder and your legs around his waist. He must be incredibly strong to stand like this while holding you. Damn!</p><p>&ldquo;Ok everyone, get ready!&rdquo; The director yelled and got into his own position. </p><p>The fans watching you were quieter now, exited to see you in action. Even though the move were to come out in almost 365 days, all of them were really excited already. You couldn&rsquo;t wait to lay in bed and watch all the videos recorded of you and Tom on set, with the other cast members. It&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve always enjoyed. You even follow a few fan accounts on Instagram. </p><p>The shot would start in a few seconds and everyone and you got into your role. You felt confident and ready to do you first stunt ever. What could possibly go wrong now?</p><p>&ldquo;And ACTION!&rdquo; The producer yelled.</p><p>The extras started walking around. Suddenly, you felt the ground disappear and your body becoming heavier. You were dragged up in the air, feeling the wind hit your face and your stomach tickling. It was wonderful and weird at the same time. </p><p>Then the unexpected happened. You could hear a loud uncomfortable crack and a few people gasping loudly. You weren&rsquo;t sure what happened, but it before you knew it people were shouting as Tom panicked. He lost the grip of you as your rope were completely broken. Only a second later you were falling towards the ground. Fans yelled, and everyone were looking at you. Suddenly, everything became black. </p><p>___</p><p>Tom landed safely on the ground as a few people rushed over to you. Your lifeless body were covered in wounds and blood. You literally hit the hard asphalt after a fall of five meters over ground. Could you even survive that?</p><p>Tom ran over to you in such a hurry, almost tripping, and quickly dragged of his mask. He looked devastated, his heart beating faster than a full speed racket. He couldn&rsquo;t speak. All he did was falling to his knees, shaking, crying. Looking like a hot mess, knowing he couldn&rsquo;t touch you. It would be risky to touch you if you had any broke bones. </p><p>&ldquo;We need to get her to a hospital! Quick!&rdquo; Someone shouted. </p><p>Not long after, you were in an ambulance driving towards the nearest hospital, leaving the cast, fans and everyone else worried and crying, devastated. &nbsp;The happening would-be all-over media in a few seconds. It didn&rsquo;t matter with your life at stake. Were you going to survive?</p><p>_____</p><p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING!
