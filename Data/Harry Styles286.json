        "body": "<p><i>- The one where Y/N is a mermaid.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://itslikeipayforit.tumblr.com/post/171056296870/master-list\"><b>\u00a0Masterlist</b></a></p><p><b><i>\u00a0A/N: ik I&rsquo;m not active at all, I&rsquo;m really trying to though! Plus, my last piece of writing was straight off smut but I decided to nit write them anymore. So, if you have anything for me to write other than smut send me!\nNow enjoy!!\n\n</i></b></p><p>It was an Autumn night. Chilly air blew past Y/N as she stood naked in front\nof the lighted pool. The cold air wasn\u2019t bothering her at all, in fact she was\nplanning to jump in to the ice like cold water in front of her, but she didn\u2019t\nknow if she should. It had been a long time, since she did that\u2026.almost seven\nyears - she realized. She glanced at the huge clock in the living room.</p><p>11:24</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t supposed to come \u2018till 1. He had texted her saying he got stuck\nwith some work in studio. Even though he told her to go to sleep and not wait\nfor him, she was there doing the most unexpected thing that Harry could have\never imagined. Y/N slowly walked towards the pool.</p><p><i>She shouldn\u2019t, she had left that life long ago.</i></p><p>But, she couldn\u2019t stop herself. There was something pulling her towards the\nwater. And without another thought she jumped. The cold water pierced through\nher skin like needles but she could never care less.</p><p>Y/N swept her legs together as she dived a little deeper in the pool, almost\ntouching the floor. At first, it was nothing -Y/N almost thought nothing was\ngoing to happen, but then there was something. It was a sensation, a very familiar\nsensation, a sensation she felt only once in her life, but she could never\nforget it.</p><p>It was her legs first - two joining, to become one; skin starting to change into\nher shabby pink scales from her torso as it went all the way down to her tail.</p><p>Then it was her chest - scales trailing fast from her torso it went up to\ncover her chest, leaving only a little trace of scales on her stomach and back.\nThe sensation went up to her face as scales appeared on the either sides of her\nface and her forehead.</p><p>Then it was her neck - skin stretched, as her muscles tore apart making\nthree bloody hollows appear on both side as if a bear had clawed her neck with its\nlong nails.</p><p>Y/N could breathe again, she could see clearly again.</p><p>In one swift motion she swept up into the air and dived right back in the\nwater.</p><p>Y/N felt different, Y/N felt free - happy.</p><p>Those were the two things Y/N never thought she\u2019d ever feel going back to\nwater.</p><p>Y/N had an interesting life in ocean, but she was never fond of it. They\nused to live in a very organized colony and they were restricted in a certain\narea for the sake of the merpeople and human.</p><p>However, Y/N didn\u2019t like it there. Maybe because she didn\u2019t get along with\nher peers, because they thought she was mental or maybe because that place\nreminded of her grand father who died when she was 10. She only had him. Her\nparents went missing while they were trying to help some human in their way to\ndestination.</p><p>Since the day of her grandfather\u2019s death, she was just waiting to turn 18 so\nshe could get out of that place. There was an enchantment, which kept any\nmerperson under 18 within the boundary of their area, but after 18 the enchantment\nbreaks and they can get out of the place any time they liked. So, the second\nY/N turned 18 she took all the things she needed and swam away.</p><p>That place made her feel suffocated. Everyone looking at her as is she was\nan human who somehow stumbled there, it just made her feel small.</p><p>After her grandfather\u2019s death, Y/N had found his notebook, where he wrote\nall types of potions he had found for helping the merpeople. There Y/N saw the\npotion which kept merpeople in human form even after coming in contact with\nwater. This had made her more determined to swim away.</p><p>All the ingredients were simple, the only complex thing was the magic but\nher grandfather had taught her that when she was very young. So, Y/N didn\u2019t\nhave much problem making the potion.</p><p>Y/N had swam for about seven days straight before she came near to any\nshores at all. First few days she just observed the humans, so she could\nsurvive at least one day - but if she was honest, she was just terrified. However\non the third night she finally got the courage and got on the quieter side of\nthe shore to let herself dry to become a human.</p><p>Y/N needed almost the whole night to get in her human form. She didn\u2019t have\nany dry clothes and her waist length long hair wasn\u2019t helping her at all. Later\nshe just pulled her hair up in a bun, so it didn\u2019t wet her body. She had her\nscales around her face but they weren\u2019t much visible. Besides her gills always\ndisappeared when her head was above water\u2026..she looked normal, at least she\nthought she did.</p><p>After she changed completely, her first target was to find some clothes\nbefore the sun rose. Looking at the human for three days and two nights, she\nunderstood enough that wearing clothes were very important for them.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t have to struggle much to find clothes she had easily found a\ndress lying on a picnic blanket as the owner was far off, partying with many\nother human. However, her biggest struggle was walking. It was her first time\nwalking after all. At first she couldn\u2019t even standstill, but after a while she\nwas fine, even though she felt her legs will give out any moment, she was able\nto walk into the city without falling.</p><p>First few months had been really hard for her, she didn\u2019t have a place to\ngo, she didn\u2019t know how to talk human tongue and she didn\u2019t know how to act\nlike them. But, Y/N was a magical creature after all; she learned their tongue\nquite fast and even got a job in a cafe and understood how to act like human.</p><p>Y/N somehow survived few months working in different places and luckily in\nher third month of being a human, she found another merperson. Later, Y/N\nstarted to live with her and two other merpersons -her life had become much\neasier from then and she didn\u2019t look back at the ocean ever again.</p><p>Y/N hadn\u2019t swam in a while, it had been so long since she did that. Not even\nas a human with her grandfather\u2019s potion she didn\u2019t risk to swim in public and\nshe never had a swimming pool.</p><p>Y/N slowly swam in the pool for a while before lying down on the tile of the\npool.</p><p><i>Heart beats fast</i></p><p><i>Colours and promises</i></p><p><i>How to be brave?</i></p><p><i>How can I love when I\u2019m afraid to fall?</i></p><p><i>But watching you stand alone</i></p><p><i>All of my doubt</i></p><p><i>Suddenly goes away somehow</i></p><p><i>One step closer</i></p><p><i>I have died every day waiting for you</i></p><p><i>Darling, don\u2019t be afraid</i></p><p><i>I have loved you for a thousand years</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll love you for a thousand more .</i></p><p>Y/N started to sing her favorite song as she looked up at the sky, stars\ntwinkling brightly.</p><p>___</p><p>It was 1:32 in the morning. Harry slowly walked inside his house. He had\nnoticed that his house was completely lit from outside. So, Harry was quite\nsurprised for not finding Y/N on couch or in the kitchen. Harry was about to go\nupstairs, thinking she had went to sleep but then he heard a voice. It was\ncoming from the pool. The voice was muffled but he could tell the voice was\nbeautiful, maybe the most beautiful voice he ever heard.</p><p>Maybe Y/N\u2019s phone fell into the pool and she was trying to get it, without\ngetting herself wet.</p><p>Harry knew how much Y/N hated water.</p><p>Only did he know, Y/N spent 18 years of her life in water.</p><p>Harry slowly made his way to the pool area, but to his surprise Y/N wasn\u2019t there\nwith a long stick trying to get her phone.</p><p>Harry scanned the pool area, and then his eyes fell on the pile of clothes.\nEven from the distance he could tell, the clothes belonged to Y/N. Adrenaline\nrushed through his veins. He hurried towards the pool and hovered over it.</p><p>However, the thing he saw, he thought never existed. It was Y/N, but not Y/N\ncompletely - It had a tail, it had gills, it had scales. It was half fish and\nhalf Y/N.</p><p>For a second he thought it was those tails one could buy in the market, but\nit looked so real. It looked like the tail originated from the very skin of\nY/N\u2019s torso. Besides, Y/N was in the water and was singing, Harry knew no human\ncould do that.</p><p><i>If she wasn\u2019t human what was she?</i></p><p>It was currently singing with its eyes closed. If it had been anyone\u2019s face\nother than Y/N\u2019s, he would\u2019ve run and would\u2019ve called the police already. But,\nhe couldn\u2019t, it<i> had</i> Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>Harry saw it open it\u2019s eyes and look directly at him, revealing the black\norbs he had once fell in love with. The warmth and happiness, Harry always felt\nlooking at those eyes - he didn\u2019t feel it anymore instead, he felt cold and\nfear.</p><p>Harry stumbled back as he saw it rise up towards him.</p><p>None of them said anything for a while. Harry just looked at it terrified.\nHe noticed its gills disappeared just the moment it came out of water and even\nwith the scales it looked just as beautiful as Y/N, if not more.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d It said, her voice was also like Y/N\u2019s, timid and soft.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Harry said before even realizing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, your Y/N,\u201d It said, hurt was evident on its face.</p><p>Harry could believe it -it looked exactly like Y/N. But, he didn\u2019t\nunderstand. He didn\u2019t know what it was. Of course, there are so many fairy\ntales about them, but they are fairy tales, not real life!</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t know what to feel, he didn\u2019t know if he should be scared of it,\nif he should believe or if he should search for Y/N\u2026.with legs and without\nscales. He just didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d It said ever so softly that Harry almost didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>It went back into the pool and swam to other end of the pool, where Y/N\u2019s\nclothes were scattered around the floor.</p><p>The half fish marched itself up at the edge of the pool as it crawled up to\nthe clothes.</p><p>Harry got on his feet and slowly went towards the creature, who looked just\nlike Y/N. Harry was still, terrified, he didn\u2019t still know if it did something to\nY/N or not. He needed answers.</p><p>The creature tied her hair up started to dry its chest by Y/N\u2019s clothes.\nHarry looked at it curiously. After a while he realized the scales on the\ncreature\u2019s chest started to disappear and revealed a pair of breasts Harry had\nseen many times before.</p><p>\u201cCan you bring me a towel,\u201d It asked.</p><p>Harry slowly nodded. Harry understood few things but he was still very\nconfused. Harry quickly grabbed a towel from the cabinet on the other side of\nthe pool and handed it to the interesting creature.

Are there\nother people like you? How could you like change, do you need potions like the\nlittle mermaid?\u201d There were so many question in Harry\u2019s mind, but the most\nimportant was - \u201cYou love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was desperate.\nHe really didn\u2019t want his last four years to be a lie. He loved her. He loved\nher more than anything and he didn\u2019t care if she was a half fish. But, if she\ndidn\u2019t love him -Harry didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. It hurt just by thinking about\nit.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I love you,\u201d Y/N said instantly as she took his face\nin her hand. \u201cI love you more than anything, Y/N inched closure to Harry,\nbut she didn\u2019t kiss her.</p><p>&ldquo;I\u2019m sorry for not telling you, I was just scared you\u2019d leave me,\u201d\nY/N said softly.</p><p>\u201cNever love,\u201d Harry smiled softly. \u201cI love you, still I don\u2019t\nunderstand anything,\u201d Harry stated.</p><p>The next two hours, Y/N spent answering all of Harry\u2019s questions.

So, if you have anything for me to write other than smut send me!\nNow enjoy!!\n\n</i></b></p><p>It was an Autumn night. Chilly air blew past Y/N as she stood naked in front\nof the lighted pool. The cold air wasn\u2019t bothering her at all, in fact she was\nplanning to jump in to the ice like cold water in front of her, but she didn\u2019t\nknow if she should. It had been a long time, since she did that\u2026.almost seven\nyears - she realized. She glanced at the huge clock in the living room.</p><p>11:24</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t supposed to come \u2018till 1. He had texted her saying he got stuck\nwith some work in studio. Even though he told her to go to sleep and not wait\nfor him, she was there doing the most unexpected thing that Harry could have\never imagined. Y/N slowly walked towards the pool.</p><p><i>She shouldn\u2019t, she had left that life long ago.</i></p><p>But, she couldn\u2019t stop herself. There was something pulling her towards the\nwater. And without another thought she jumped. The cold water pierced through\nher skin like needles but she could never care less.</p><p>Y/N swept her legs together as she dived a little deeper in the pool, almost\ntouching the floor. At first, it was nothing -Y/N almost thought nothing was\ngoing to happen, but then there was something. It was a sensation, a very familiar\nsensation, a sensation she felt only once in her life, but she could never\nforget it.</p><p>It was her legs first - two joining, to become one; skin starting to change into\nher shabby pink scales from her torso as it went all the way down to her tail.</p><p>Then it was her chest - scales trailing fast from her torso it went up to\ncover her chest, leaving only a little trace of scales on her stomach and back.\nThe sensation went up to her face as scales appeared on the either sides of her\nface and her forehead.</p><p>Then it was her neck - skin stretched, as her muscles tore apart making\nthree bloody hollows appear on both side as if a bear had clawed her neck with its\nlong nails.</p><p>Y/N could breathe again, she could see clearly again.</p><p>In one swift motion she swept up into the air and dived right back in the\nwater.</p><p>Y/N felt different, Y/N felt free - happy.</p><p>Those were the two things Y/N never thought she\u2019d ever feel going back to\nwater.</p><p>Y/N had an interesting life in ocean, but she was never fond of it. They\nused to live in a very organized colony and they were restricted in a certain\narea for the sake of the merpeople and human.</p><p>However, Y/N didn\u2019t like it there. Maybe because she didn\u2019t get along with\nher peers, because they thought she was mental or maybe because that place\nreminded of her grand father who died when she was 10. She only had him. Her\nparents went missing while they were trying to help some human in their way to\ndestination.</p><p>Since the day of her grandfather\u2019s death, she was just waiting to turn 18 so\nshe could get out of that place. There was an enchantment, which kept any\nmerperson under 18 within the boundary of their area, but after 18 the enchantment\nbreaks and they can get out of the place any time they liked. So, the second\nY/N turned 18 she took all the things she needed and swam away.</p><p>That place made her feel suffocated. Everyone looking at her as is she was\nan human who somehow stumbled there, it just made her feel small.</p><p>After her grandfather\u2019s death, Y/N had found his notebook, where he wrote\nall types of potions he had found for helping the merpeople. There Y/N saw the\npotion which kept merpeople in human form even after coming in contact with\nwater. This had made her more determined to swim away.</p><p>All the ingredients were simple, the only complex thing was the magic but\nher grandfather had taught her that when she was very young. So, Y/N didn\u2019t\nhave much problem making the potion.</p><p>Y/N had swam for about seven days straight before she came near to any\nshores at all. First few days she just observed the humans, so she could\nsurvive at least one day - but if she was honest, she was just terrified. However\non the third night she finally got the courage and got on the quieter side of\nthe shore to let herself dry to become a human.</p><p>Y/N needed almost the whole night to get in her human form. She didn\u2019t have\nany dry clothes and her waist length long hair wasn\u2019t helping her at all. Later\nshe just pulled her hair up in a bun, so it didn\u2019t wet her body. She had her\nscales around her face but they weren\u2019t much visible. Besides her gills always\ndisappeared when her head was above water\u2026..she looked normal, at least she\nthought she did.</p><p>After she changed completely, her first target was to find some clothes\nbefore the sun rose. Looking at the human for three days and two nights, she\nunderstood enough that wearing clothes were very important for them.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t have to struggle much to find clothes she had easily found a\ndress lying on a picnic blanket as the owner was far off, partying with many\nother human. However, her biggest struggle was walking. It was her first time\nwalking after all. At first she couldn\u2019t even standstill, but after a while she\nwas fine, even though she felt her legs will give out any moment, she was able\nto walk into the city without falling.</p><p>First few months had been really hard for her, she didn\u2019t have a place to\ngo, she didn\u2019t know how to talk human tongue and she didn\u2019t know how to act\nlike them. But, Y/N was a magical creature after all; she learned their tongue\nquite fast and even got a job in a cafe and understood how to act like human.</p><p>Y/N somehow survived few months working in different places and luckily in\nher third month of being a human, she found another merperson. Later, Y/N\nstarted to live with her and two other merpersons -her life had become much\neasier from then and she didn\u2019t look back at the ocean ever again.</p><p>Y/N hadn\u2019t swam in a while, it had been so long since she did that. Not even\nas a human with her grandfather\u2019s potion she didn\u2019t risk to swim in public and\nshe never had a swimming pool.</p><p>Y/N slowly swam in the pool for a while before lying down on the tile of the\npool.</p><p><i>Heart beats fast</i></p><p><i>Colours and promises</i></p><p><i>How to be brave?</i></p><p><i>How can I love when I\u2019m afraid to fall?</i></p><p><i>But watching you stand alone</i></p><p><i>All of my doubt</i></p><p><i>Suddenly goes away somehow</i></p><p><i>One step closer</i></p><p><i>I have died every day waiting for you</i></p><p><i>Darling, don\u2019t be afraid</i></p><p><i>I have loved you for a thousand years</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll love you for a thousand more .</i></p><p>Y/N started to sing her favorite song as she looked up at the sky, stars\ntwinkling brightly.</p><p>___</p><p>It was 1:32 in the morning. Harry slowly walked inside his house. He had\nnoticed that his house was completely lit from outside. So, Harry was quite\nsurprised for not finding Y/N on couch or in the kitchen. Harry was about to go\nupstairs, thinking she had went to sleep but then he heard a voice. It was\ncoming from the pool. The voice was muffled but he could tell the voice was\nbeautiful, maybe the most beautiful voice he ever heard.</p><p>Maybe Y/N\u2019s phone fell into the pool and she was trying to get it, without\ngetting herself wet.</p><p>Harry knew how much Y/N hated water.</p><p>Only did he know, Y/N spent 18 years of her life in water.</p><p>Harry slowly made his way to the pool area, but to his surprise Y/N wasn\u2019t there\nwith a long stick trying to get her phone.</p><p>Harry scanned the pool area, and then his eyes fell on the pile of clothes.\nEven from the distance he could tell, the clothes belonged to Y/N. Adrenaline\nrushed through his veins. He hurried towards the pool and hovered over it.</p><p>However, the thing he saw, he thought never existed. It was Y/N, but not Y/N\ncompletely - It had a tail, it had gills, it had scales. It was half fish and\nhalf Y/N.</p><p>For a second he thought it was those tails one could buy in the market, but\nit looked so real. It looked like the tail originated from the very skin of\nY/N\u2019s torso. Besides, Y/N was in the water and was singing, Harry knew no human\ncould do that.</p><p><i>If she wasn\u2019t human what was she?</i></p><p>It was currently singing with its eyes closed. If it had been anyone\u2019s face\nother than Y/N\u2019s, he would\u2019ve run and would\u2019ve called the police already. But,\nhe couldn\u2019t, it<i> had</i> Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>Harry saw it open it\u2019s eyes and look directly at him, revealing the black\norbs he had once fell in love with. The warmth and happiness, Harry always felt\nlooking at those eyes - he didn\u2019t feel it anymore instead, he felt cold and\nfear.</p><p>Harry stumbled back as he saw it rise up towards him.</p><p>None of them said anything for a while. Harry just looked at it terrified.\nHe noticed its gills disappeared just the moment it came out of water and even\nwith the scales it looked just as beautiful as Y/N, if not more.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d It said, her voice was also like Y/N\u2019s, timid and soft.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Harry said before even realizing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, your Y/N,\u201d It said, hurt was evident on its face.</p><p>Harry could believe it -it looked exactly like Y/N. But, he didn\u2019t\nunderstand. He didn\u2019t know what it was. Of course, there are so many fairy\ntales about them, but they are fairy tales, not real life!</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t know what to feel, he didn\u2019t know if he should be scared of it,\nif he should believe or if he should search for Y/N\u2026.with legs and without\nscales. He just didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d It said ever so softly that Harry almost didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>It went back into the pool and swam to other end of the pool, where Y/N\u2019s\nclothes were scattered around the floor.</p><p>The half fish marched itself up at the edge of the pool as it crawled up to\nthe clothes.</p><p>Harry got on his feet and slowly went towards the creature, who looked just\nlike Y/N. Harry was still, terrified, he didn\u2019t still know if it did something to\nY/N or not. He needed answers.</p><p>The creature tied her hair up started to dry its chest by Y/N\u2019s clothes.\nHarry looked at it curiously. After a while he realized the scales on the\ncreature\u2019s chest started to disappear and revealed a pair of breasts Harry had\nseen many times before.</p><p>\u201cCan you bring me a towel,\u201d It asked.</p><p>Harry slowly nodded. Harry understood few things but he was still very\nconfused. Harry quickly grabbed a towel from the cabinet on the other side of\nthe pool and handed it to the interesting creature. The whole time he was\nlooking at her, in afraid that he might miss something or that it might\ndisappear.</p><p>It wiped on her scale from her torso to the very end of her tail while Harry\nit\u2019s every move sitting on one of the pool sits.</p><p>After a while Y/N stopped and used the towel to cover her chest and looked\nup at Harry.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t quite understand at first, but then it was her tail shrinking\nand slowly disappearing as two of her legs reappeared.</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth was agape. He didn\u2019t know what to think. He looked at Y/N to\nher legs, it really was her.</p><p>\u201cWh- ho,\u201d Harry slumped down next to her. He couldn\u2019t even say a\nfull word.</p><p>He was utterly speechless.</p><p>\u201cHarry I should have told you this long before,\u201d Y/N took Harry\u2019s\nhand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a merperson,\u201d Y/N stated looking straight in Harry\u2019s eyes.

She didn\u2019t have\nany dry clothes and her waist length long hair wasn\u2019t helping her at all. Later\nshe just pulled her hair up in a bun, so it didn\u2019t wet her body. She had her\nscales around her face but they weren\u2019t much visible. Besides her gills always\ndisappeared when her head was above water\u2026..she looked normal, at least she\nthought she did.</p><p>After she changed completely, her first target was to find some clothes\nbefore the sun rose. Looking at the human for three days and two nights, she\nunderstood enough that wearing clothes were very important for them.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t have to struggle much to find clothes she had easily found a\ndress lying on a picnic blanket as the owner was far off, partying with many\nother human. However, her biggest struggle was walking. It was her first time\nwalking after all. At first she couldn\u2019t even standstill, but after a while she\nwas fine, even though she felt her legs will give out any moment, she was able\nto walk into the city without falling.</p><p>First few months had been really hard for her, she didn\u2019t have a place to\ngo, she didn\u2019t know how to talk human tongue and she didn\u2019t know how to act\nlike them. But, Y/N was a magical creature after all; she learned their tongue\nquite fast and even got a job in a cafe and understood how to act like human.</p><p>Y/N somehow survived few months working in different places and luckily in\nher third month of being a human, she found another merperson. Later, Y/N\nstarted to live with her and two other merpersons -her life had become much\neasier from then and she didn\u2019t look back at the ocean ever again.</p><p>Y/N hadn\u2019t swam in a while, it had been so long since she did that. Not even\nas a human with her grandfather\u2019s potion she didn\u2019t risk to swim in public and\nshe never had a swimming pool.</p><p>Y/N slowly swam in the pool for a while before lying down on the tile of the\npool.</p><p><i>Heart beats fast</i></p><p><i>Colours and promises</i></p><p><i>How to be brave?</i></p><p><i>How can I love when I\u2019m afraid to fall?</i></p><p><i>But watching you stand alone</i></p><p><i>All of my doubt</i></p><p><i>Suddenly goes away somehow</i></p><p><i>One step closer</i></p><p><i>I have died every day waiting for you</i></p><p><i>Darling, don\u2019t be afraid</i></p><p><i>I have loved you for a thousand years</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll love you for a thousand more .</i></p><p>Y/N started to sing her favorite song as she looked up at the sky, stars\ntwinkling brightly.</p><p>___</p><p>It was 1:32 in the morning. Harry slowly walked inside his house. He had\nnoticed that his house was completely lit from outside. So, Harry was quite\nsurprised for not finding Y/N on couch or in the kitchen. Harry was about to go\nupstairs, thinking she had went to sleep but then he heard a voice. It was\ncoming from the pool. The voice was muffled but he could tell the voice was\nbeautiful, maybe the most beautiful voice he ever heard.</p><p>Maybe Y/N\u2019s phone fell into the pool and she was trying to get it, without\ngetting herself wet.</p><p>Harry knew how much Y/N hated water.</p><p>Only did he know, Y/N spent 18 years of her life in water.</p><p>Harry slowly made his way to the pool area, but to his surprise Y/N wasn\u2019t there\nwith a long stick trying to get her phone.</p><p>Harry scanned the pool area, and then his eyes fell on the pile of clothes.\nEven from the distance he could tell, the clothes belonged to Y/N. Adrenaline\nrushed through his veins. He hurried towards the pool and hovered over it.</p><p>However, the thing he saw, he thought never existed. It was Y/N, but not Y/N\ncompletely - It had a tail, it had gills, it had scales. It was half fish and\nhalf Y/N.</p><p>For a second he thought it was those tails one could buy in the market, but\nit looked so real. It looked like the tail originated from the very skin of\nY/N\u2019s torso. Besides, Y/N was in the water and was singing, Harry knew no human\ncould do that.</p><p><i>If she wasn\u2019t human what was she?</i></p><p>It was currently singing with its eyes closed. If it had been anyone\u2019s face\nother than Y/N\u2019s, he would\u2019ve run and would\u2019ve called the police already. But,\nhe couldn\u2019t, it<i> had</i> Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>Harry saw it open it\u2019s eyes and look directly at him, revealing the black\norbs he had once fell in love with. The warmth and happiness, Harry always felt\nlooking at those eyes - he didn\u2019t feel it anymore instead, he felt cold and\nfear.</p><p>Harry stumbled back as he saw it rise up towards him.</p><p>None of them said anything for a while. Harry just looked at it terrified.\nHe noticed its gills disappeared just the moment it came out of water and even\nwith the scales it looked just as beautiful as Y/N, if not more.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d It said, her voice was also like Y/N\u2019s, timid and soft.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Harry said before even realizing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, your Y/N,\u201d It said, hurt was evident on its face.</p><p>Harry could believe it -it looked exactly like Y/N. But, he didn\u2019t\nunderstand. He didn\u2019t know what it was. Of course, there are so many fairy\ntales about them, but they are fairy tales, not real life!</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t know what to feel, he didn\u2019t know if he should be scared of it,\nif he should believe or if he should search for Y/N\u2026.with legs and without\nscales. He just didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d It said ever so softly that Harry almost didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>It went back into the pool and swam to other end of the pool, where Y/N\u2019s\nclothes were scattered around the floor.</p><p>The half fish marched itself up at the edge of the pool as it crawled up to\nthe clothes.</p><p>Harry got on his feet and slowly went towards the creature, who looked just\nlike Y/N. Harry was still, terrified, he didn\u2019t still know if it did something to\nY/N or not. He needed answers.</p><p>The creature tied her hair up started to dry its chest by Y/N\u2019s clothes.\nHarry looked at it curiously. After a while he realized the scales on the\ncreature\u2019s chest started to disappear and revealed a pair of breasts Harry had\nseen many times before.</p><p>\u201cCan you bring me a towel,\u201d It asked.</p><p>Harry slowly nodded. Harry understood few things but he was still very\nconfused. Harry quickly grabbed a towel from the cabinet on the other side of\nthe pool and handed it to the interesting creature. The whole time he was\nlooking at her, in afraid that he might miss something or that it might\ndisappear.</p><p>It wiped on her scale from her torso to the very end of her tail while Harry\nit\u2019s every move sitting on one of the pool sits.</p><p>After a while Y/N stopped and used the towel to cover her chest and looked\nup at Harry.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t quite understand at first, but then it was her tail shrinking\nand slowly disappearing as two of her legs reappeared.</p><p>Harry\u2019s mouth was agape. He didn\u2019t know what to think. He looked at Y/N to\nher legs, it really was her.</p><p>\u201cWh- ho,\u201d Harry slumped down next to her. He couldn\u2019t even say a\nfull word.</p><p>He was utterly speechless.</p><p>\u201cHarry I should have told you this long before,\u201d Y/N took Harry\u2019s\nhand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a merperson,\u201d Y/N stated looking straight in Harry\u2019s eyes. He\nwas still confused, Y/N could see it.</p><p>\u201cMermaid really, as you guys call it,\u201d Y/N said.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand, then what are you doing here? Are there\nother people like you? How could you like change, do you need potions like the\nlittle mermaid?\u201d There were so many question in Harry\u2019s mind, but the most\nimportant was - \u201cYou love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was desperate.\nHe really didn\u2019t want his last four years to be a lie. He loved her. He loved\nher more than anything and he didn\u2019t care if she was a half fish. But, if she\ndidn\u2019t love him -Harry didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. It hurt just by thinking about\nit.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I love you,\u201d Y/N said instantly as she took his face\nin her hand. \u201cI love you more than anything, Y/N inched closure to Harry,\nbut she didn\u2019t kiss her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you, I was just scared you\u2019d leave me,\u201d\nY/N said softly.</p><p>\u201cNever love,\u201d Harry smiled softly. \u201cI love you, still I don\u2019t\nunderstand anything,\u201d Harry stated.</p><p>The next two hours, Y/N spent answering all of Harry\u2019s questions. Even\nthough few of Harry\u2019s questions were stupid,but Y/N couldn\u2019t really blame him,\nhe was very confused afterall.</p><p>\u201cCan I see you like that again?\u201d Harry finally said after a long\nsilence. He needed time to consume everything Y/N had said.</p><p>Y/N said nothing but smiled brightly before letting go of the towel and\njumping in the pool.</p><p>Harry saw her transform from above the water. It was a miracle in Harry\u2019s\neyes - it was beautiful.</p><p>Y/N poked her head out of water before gesturing Harry to jump in with her.\nHarry spent no time to strip in his boxer and jump in with her.</p><p>Rest of the night they spent swimming in the pool and Harry caressing her\ntail every now and then.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful, in just every way possible,\u201d he would whisper.</p>",

Plus, my last piece of writing was straight off smut but I decided to nit write them anymore. So, if you have anything for me to write other than smut send me!\nNow enjoy!!\n\n</i></b></p><p>It was an Autumn night. Chilly air blew past Y/N as she stood naked in front\nof the lighted pool. The cold air wasn&rsquo;t bothering her at all, in fact she was\nplanning to jump in to the ice like cold water in front of her, but she didn&rsquo;t\nknow if she should. It had been a long time, since she did that&hellip;.almost seven\nyears - she realized. She glanced at the huge clock in the living room.</p><p>11:24</p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t supposed to come &lsquo;till 1. He had texted her saying he got stuck\nwith some work in studio. Even though he told her to go to sleep and not wait\nfor him, she was there doing the most unexpected thing that Harry could have\never imagined. Y/N slowly walked towards the pool.</p><p><i>She shouldn&rsquo;t, she had left that life long ago.</i></p><p>But, she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself. There was something pulling her towards the\nwater. And without another thought she jumped. The cold water pierced through\nher skin like needles but she could never care less.</p><p>Y/N swept her legs together as she dived a little deeper in the pool, almost\ntouching the floor. At first, it was nothing -Y/N almost thought nothing was\ngoing to happen, but then there was something. It was a sensation, a very familiar\nsensation, a sensation she felt only once in her life, but she could never\nforget it.</p><p>It was her legs first - two joining, to become one; skin starting to change into\nher shabby pink scales from her torso as it went all the way down to her tail.</p><p>Then it was her chest - scales trailing fast from her torso it went up to\ncover her chest, leaving only a little trace of scales on her stomach and back.\nThe sensation went up to her face as scales appeared on the either sides of her\nface and her forehead.</p><p>Then it was her neck - skin stretched, as her muscles tore apart making\nthree bloody hollows appear on both side as if a bear had clawed her neck with its\nlong nails.</p><p>Y/N could breathe again, she could see clearly again.</p><p>In one swift motion she swept up into the air and dived right back in the\nwater.</p><p>Y/N felt different, Y/N felt free - happy.</p><p>Those were the two things Y/N never thought she&rsquo;d ever feel going back to\nwater.</p><p>Y/N had an interesting life in ocean, but she was never fond of it. They\nused to live in a very organized colony and they were restricted in a certain\narea for the sake of the merpeople and human.</p><p>However, Y/N didn&rsquo;t like it there. Maybe because she didn&rsquo;t get along with\nher peers, because they thought she was mental or maybe because that place\nreminded of her grand father who died when she was 10. She only had him. Her\nparents went missing while they were trying to help some human in their way to\ndestination.</p><p>Since the day of her grandfather&rsquo;s death, she was just waiting to turn 18 so\nshe could get out of that place. There was an enchantment, which kept any\nmerperson under 18 within the boundary of their area, but after 18 the enchantment\nbreaks and they can get out of the place any time they liked. So, the second\nY/N turned 18 she took all the things she needed and swam away.</p><p>That place made her feel suffocated. Everyone looking at her as is she was\nan human who somehow stumbled there, it just made her feel small.</p><p>After her grandfather&rsquo;s death, Y/N had found his notebook, where he wrote\nall types of potions he had found for helping the merpeople. There Y/N saw the\npotion which kept merpeople in human form even after coming in contact with\nwater. This had made her more determined to swim away.</p><p>All the ingredients were simple, the only complex thing was the magic but\nher grandfather had taught her that when she was very young. So, Y/N didn&rsquo;t\nhave much problem making the potion.</p><p>Y/N had swam for about seven days straight before she came near to any\nshores at all. First few days she just observed the humans, so she could\nsurvive at least one day - but if she was honest, she was just terrified. However\non the third night she finally got the courage and got on the quieter side of\nthe shore to let herself dry to become a human.</p><p>Y/N needed almost the whole night to get in her human form. She didn&rsquo;t have\nany dry clothes and her waist length long hair wasn&rsquo;t helping her at all. Later\nshe just pulled her hair up in a bun, so it didn&rsquo;t wet her body. She had her\nscales around her face but they weren&rsquo;t much visible. Besides her gills always\ndisappeared when her head was above water&hellip;..she looked normal, at least she\nthought she did.</p><p>After she changed completely, her first target was to find some clothes\nbefore the sun rose. Looking at the human for three days and two nights, she\nunderstood enough that wearing clothes were very important for them.</p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t have to struggle much to find clothes she had easily found a\ndress lying on a picnic blanket as the owner was far off, partying with many\nother human. However, her biggest struggle was walking. It was her first time\nwalking after all. At first she couldn&rsquo;t even standstill, but after a while she\nwas fine, even though she felt her legs will give out any moment, she was able\nto walk into the city without falling.</p><p>First few months had been really hard for her, she didn&rsquo;t have a place to\ngo, she didn&rsquo;t know how to talk human tongue and she didn&rsquo;t know how to act\nlike them. But, Y/N was a magical creature after all; she learned their tongue\nquite fast and even got a job in a cafe and understood how to act like human.</p><p>Y/N somehow survived few months working in different places and luckily in\nher third month of being a human, she found another merperson.
