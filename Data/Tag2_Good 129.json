I haven't read a book for my own enjoyment for years and I really want to but I don't know where to start!! I'm going to read Good Omens as I desperately want to read the book before watching the TV show. Any genre's good (apart from horror or romance). If you can't think of any don't worry!! Just thought I'd ask saying I found out about Good Omens from you \ud83d\ude02 x",
        "answer": "<p>Charlie! This is such exciting news! I\u2019m so so excited for you. Reading is good (even though I have been <i>so</i>\u00a0lax about it lately) and <i>Good Omens</i>\u00a0is truly an excellent book. Come hit me up as you\u2019re reading it! I\u2019m aiming to do a reread before the show premieres on May 31st!</p><p>But let&rsquo;s get you some other book recommendations! (I tried to keep these kind of general and across the board in the hopes that you\u2019ll find at least one thing you\u2019ll like? If not, please do come back and tell me. That way I can generate a new list!)\u00a0</p><p><b>CORALINE:</b>\u00a0I don\u2019t know how familiar you are with Neil Gaiman\u2019s writing, or even this book (or the movie based on it), but I figured I\u2019d throw at least one book on here by him, because he really hasn\u2019t produced any clunkers. This is just a really good story about being brave and facing your fears &ndash; something I feel is relevant in your college years. (And at various other points in your life!) You might also want to check out his book <i>Stardust</i>, and the excellent movie based on it.\u00a0</p><p><b>HIS DARK MATERIALS:</b>\u00a0This iconic trilogy from Philip Pullman is easily three of my favourite books, and they get better each time I reread them. It starts as the story of a young girl setting out to rescue her friend and grows into something much larger. It seems meant for kids, but to me feels universal, and each time I\u2019ve reread it, I\u2019ve come away with new meaning. I hope it does the same for you.</p><p><b>GENTLEMAN\u2019S GUIDE TO VICE AND VIRTUE:</b>\u00a0A historical YA novel that tells the story of Henry\u00a0\u201cMonty\u201d Montague, a young bisexual disaster of a man who is hopelessly in love with his best friend, Percy. It\u2019s one of my favourite books of all time, and has a modern sensibility to it as it examines sexuality, gender, and race in that time. One of my favourite characters in it, Felicity, happens to be asexual <i>and</i>\u00a0is the lead of her own novel, <i>Ladies Guide to Petticoats and Piracy</i>. (Which I also adored.) [Side note: There is a romance in this, but it isn\u2019t of the\u00a0\u201cromance\u201d genre, which is what I took you to mean.]</p><p><b>SIX OF CROWS: </b>The first part of a duology\u00a0(the second is called <i>Crooked Kingdom</i>), that is basically a heist novel. It\u2019s tense, action-packed, and filled with an inclusive cast, each of whom is my children and I would die for them. Netflix is adapting both books, as well as Leigh Bardugo\u2019s trilogy, which is set in the same universe as this, so it\u2019ll be nice to get a jump on that!\u00a0</p><p><b>ARISTOTLE AND DANTE DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE:\u00a0</b>I have yet to meet someone who didn\u2019t love this book, which is about two young Mexican boys growing up in, I think, the 80s and their friendship as they discover who they are and what it means for their friendship and each other. The coming of age story the author weaves is super tender and very heartfelt, but what really sings is his wriing. He\u2019s an incredible author and you just feel everything he describes. I feel like this one really stayed with me.\u00a0</p><p><b>CUCKOO\u2019S CALLING:</b>\u00a0The first Cormorran Strike novel has a great mystery at its heart and is a fine introduction to Strike and his partner Robin. It\u2019s a nice reminder that Rowling can write a very good mystery and that she makes it all seem effortless. (I also breezed by all the books in the series during a rough reading patch, and I feel like that might help you.) This has also since been adapted.\u00a0</p><p><b>THIRTEENTH TALE:</b>\u00a0It\u2019s part mystery, part examination of the tales we tell ourselves and what stories can mean and how they can guide us. I love it so much, and I read it one fell swoop. The writing is quite lush and she sucks in you effectively. It\u2019s about a young woman asked to write a biography of this older woman, and her days spent doing that. Olivia Colman starred in the BBC movie of it. I quite enjoyed that too.\u00a0</p><p><b>NIGHT CIRCUS:</b>\u00a0I always pair this one with the one above, because I read them the same summer and they both just took me by the hand and made my heart run. But this is more romantic fairy tale fantasy, about two dueling magicians who are trying to prove what is better, nature vs. nurture while outdoing each other with magic tricks, while falling deeper and deeper in love with each other. It\u2019s incredible.\u00a0</p><p><b>GIANT DAYS:</b>\u00a0This is a comic, but it\u2019s one of my absolute favourites in that I fucking pay to get each issue as it comes rather than waiting for a collected volume. The pop culture references are on point and John Allison is a wiz with humour, but I think the thing I love most is just how relatable it is on so many levels. You get the joys and pain and humour and ridiculousness of friendships and college life and I think it\u2019ll really speak to you. (Also, Daisy\u2019s coming out is rather nice.)\u00a0</p><p><b>SAGA:</b>\u00a0I had to take a break from reading it because I just sat around thinking about how good this comic series is. There\u2019s a reason it wins so many awards, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s just masterful. The art is exquisite, and the writing top notch, and I fall in love with it more every time I read it. I can\u2019t sum it up accurately. But just know that it\u2019s about love and family and doing what you have to in order to survive in the face of a universe that wants you apart. It\u2019s gorgeous. (Also, kind of a space opera.)\u00a0</p>",

Reading is good (even though I have been <i>so</i>\u00a0lax about it lately) and <i>Good Omens</i>\u00a0is truly an excellent book. Come hit me up as you\u2019re reading it! I\u2019m aiming to do a reread before the show premieres on May 31st!</p><p>But let\u2019s get you some other book recommendations! (I tried to keep these kind of general and across the board in the hopes that you\u2019ll find at least one thing you\u2019ll like? If not, please do come back and tell me. That way I can generate a new list!)\u00a0</p><p><b>CORALINE:</b>\u00a0I don\u2019t know how familiar you are with Neil Gaiman\u2019s writing, or even this book (or the movie based on it), but I figured I\u2019d throw at least one book on here by him, because he really hasn\u2019t produced any clunkers. This is just a really good story about being brave and facing your fears \u2013 something I feel is relevant in your college years. (And at various other points in your life!) You might also want to check out his book <i>Stardust</i>, and the excellent movie based on it.\u00a0</p><p><b>HIS DARK MATERIALS:</b>\u00a0This iconic trilogy from Philip Pullman is easily three of my favourite books, and they get better each time I reread them. It starts as the story of a young girl setting out to rescue her friend and grows into something much larger. It seems meant for kids, but to me feels universal, and each time I\u2019ve reread it, I\u2019ve come away with new meaning. I hope it does the same for you.</p><p><b>GENTLEMAN\u2019S GUIDE TO VICE AND VIRTUE:</b>\u00a0A historical YA novel that tells the story of Henry\u00a0\u201cMonty\u201d Montague, a young bisexual disaster of a man who is hopelessly in love with his best friend, Percy. It\u2019s one of my favourite books of all time, and has a modern sensibility to it as it examines sexuality, gender, and race in that time. One of my favourite characters in it, Felicity, happens to be asexual <i>and</i>\u00a0is the lead of her own novel, <i>Ladies Guide to Petticoats and Piracy</i>. (Which I also adored.) [Side note: There is a romance in this, but it isn\u2019t of the\u00a0\u201cromance\u201d genre, which is what I took you to mean.]</p><p><b>SIX OF CROWS: </b>The first part of a duology\u00a0(the second is called <i>Crooked Kingdom</i>), that is basically a heist novel. It\u2019s tense, action-packed, and filled with an inclusive cast, each of whom is my children and I would die for them. Netflix is adapting both books, as well as Leigh Bardugo\u2019s trilogy, which is set in the same universe as this, so it\u2019ll be nice to get a jump on that!\u00a0</p><p><b>ARISTOTLE AND DANTE DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE:\u00a0</b>I have yet to meet someone who didn\u2019t love this book, which is about two young Mexican boys growing up in, I think, the 80s and their friendship as they discover who they are and what it means for their friendship and each other. The coming of age story the author weaves is super tender and very heartfelt, but what really sings is his wriing. He\u2019s an incredible author and you just feel everything he describes. I feel like this one really stayed with me.\u00a0</p><p><b>CUCKOO\u2019S CALLING:</b>\u00a0The first Cormorran Strike novel has a great mystery at its heart and is a fine introduction to Strike and his partner Robin. It\u2019s a nice reminder that Rowling can write a very good mystery and that she makes it all seem effortless. (I also breezed by all the books in the series during a rough reading patch, and I feel like that might help you.) This has also since been adapted.\u00a0</p><p><b>THIRTEENTH TALE:</b>\u00a0It\u2019s part mystery, part examination of the tales we tell ourselves and what stories can mean and how they can guide us. I love it so much, and I read it one fell swoop. The writing is quite lush and she sucks in you effectively. It\u2019s about a young woman asked to write a biography of this older woman, and her days spent doing that. Olivia Colman starred in the BBC movie of it. I quite enjoyed that too.\u00a0</p><p><b>NIGHT CIRCUS:</b>\u00a0I always pair this one with the one above, because I read them the same summer and they both just took me by the hand and made my heart run. But this is more romantic fairy tale fantasy, about two dueling magicians who are trying to prove what is better, nature vs. nurture while outdoing each other with magic tricks, while falling deeper and deeper in love with each other. It\u2019s incredible.\u00a0</p><p><b>GIANT DAYS:</b>\u00a0This is a comic, but it\u2019s one of my absolute favourites in that I fucking pay to get each issue as it comes rather than waiting for a collected volume. The pop culture references are on point and John Allison is a wiz with humour, but I think the thing I love most is just how relatable it is on so many levels. You get the joys and pain and humour and ridiculousness of friendships and college life and I think it\u2019ll really speak to you. (Also, Daisy\u2019s coming out is rather nice.)\u00a0</p><p><b>SAGA:</b>\u00a0I had to take a break from reading it because I just sat around thinking about how good this comic series is. There\u2019s a reason it wins so many awards, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s just masterful. The art is exquisite, and the writing top notch, and I fall in love with it more every time I read it. I can\u2019t sum it up accurately. But just know that it\u2019s about love and family and doing what you have to in order to survive in the face of a universe that wants you apart. It\u2019s gorgeous. (Also, kind of a space opera.)\u00a0</p>",
