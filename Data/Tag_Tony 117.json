But\u2013 but Tony, it\u2019s not gonnna ring. You know it\u2019s not.\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony stared at him, fisting his hand into his side and resisting the urge to just tell Rhodey to get the fuck out and leave him alone. He\u2019d known the guy for too long to think that Rhodey would ever listen to an order like that. Instead, he turned away, pushing past him and reaching over to the Whiskey once more. His fingers popped the lid with ease and he poured a generous amount into his tumbler before throwing it all back in one. Behind him, Rhodey just sighed,\u00a0</p><p>Tony was exceptionally good at letting people down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to give up on him someday.\u201d Rhodey murmured, voice gentle as he rested his hand on Tony\u2019s shoulder. Tony looked down at the floor stubbornly, mouth pursed tight. He didn\u2019t want to have this conversation. Not now, not ever</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy, pal,\u201d he laughed bitterly and shook his head, focusing on the bite of the alcohol at the back of his throat instead of the one at the back of his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know, I know, Tony, but you just have to-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c-No, you don\u2019t fucking <i>get it,\u201d</i> Tony spun around and looked at him, shoving the hand off his shoulder and then pushing weakly at Rhodey\u2019s chest,\u00a0\u201cyou don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, to be <i>that </i>in love with someone and know they won\u2019t ever fucking feel even a <i>tenth </i>of what you do. You\u2019ve never had your heart ripped out of your fucking chest by the one person that all you ever wanted to do was trust, and then watch him turn and leave for someone else.\u201d Tony sucked in a shaky breath, running a hand through his hair and then turning away before Rhodey could see the telltale sparkling behind his eyes. Not tonight. Not fucking tonight.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to get hurt, over and <i>over and over again,</i> and still be fucking pathetic enough to want to hold so desperately onto the last remaining piece of them. Because <i>you\u2019re </i>not pathetic. You\u2019re not a fucking idiot, not like me.\u201d<br/></p><p>He thought of those piercing blue eyes, smiling down at him across the breakfast table. The shared jokes and little touches that had sparked off a chain reaction across Tony\u2019s skin every damned time. He remembered every screaming match they\u2019d had, the ones at the very beginning when Tony had just wanted to kiss him until he shut his goddamned mouth, and then the ones later, when Tony had screamed himself hoarse because Steve was <i>reckless </i>and <i>stupid </i>and scared the shit out of him every time he threw himself into the line of fire.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d always loved Steve, even when he\u2019d hated him.

To Steve- to anyone.\u00a0</p><p>Rhodey opened his mouth to say something else, but Tony smacked a hand through the air and swallowed down the lump in his throat. His hand curled around the neck of the bottle as he swiped it off the table and began to back away.\u00a0\u201cFuck off, Rhodey,\u201d he said with a wave,\u00a0\u201cI have work to do. Feel free to take the couch, but don\u2019t disturb me in there.\u201d<br/></p><p>He marched out of the room and shoved the bottle up to his lips, feeling it burn as it trickled down his throat. He pulled the phone out of his pocket and glared at it, thinking about throwing it against the wall, crushing it under his foot, beating the damn thing with a baseball bat. That\u2019d probably be cathartic.</p><p>But that\u2019s all they were. Thoughts. They would never turn into actions, and everyone knew it. Tony was just too fucking weak.</p><p>He smiled and wiped the errant tear off his face, chugging another mouthful of Whiskey. Who even cared, anyway? Not him.\u00a0</p><p>Nope. Not at all.</p>",

More accurately, Rhodey was staring at the little bulge in the front of his blazer, where the flip-phone was nestled firmly in the pocket. The same way it had been yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that. The same way it had been for a year, now.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony really had no idea why he hadn&rsquo;t just shoved the thing into a drawer by now. It was ridiculous, and Steve quite clearly wasn&rsquo;t going to call. That had never been a possibility, not really. It&rsquo;d just been a precaution. A way to reach him in case the world started ending. Steve hadn&rsquo;t left it with him to try and repair what had been broken. To be frank, Tony was certain the man simply didn&rsquo;t care enough for that.&nbsp;</p><p>And why he hell would he? He had Barnes, he had the rest of the team. There was no need for Tony to be in his life any more.</p><p>So really, Tony should throw the thing away.</p><p>But that didn&rsquo;t mean he was going to, obviously. No matter how many stupid pitying looks his asshole best friend gave him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Can you cut that out?&rdquo; He snapped irritably, flapping a hand in Rhodey&rsquo;s face and then turning away.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very distracting.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodey sighed, grabbing the bottle of whiskey from Tony&rsquo;s counter before he could get his fingers on it and then sliding it away. Tony glared at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not healthy, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, the drinking? Because I&rsquo;ve been doing that all my life, honeybunch, as you well know, so it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to be stopping any time soon-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The way you carry that damn phone around like it&rsquo;s a piece of Steve&rsquo;s soul,&rdquo; Rhodey interrupted, eyes moving back down to Tony&rsquo;s jacket once more.&nbsp;&ldquo;Business meetings, battles, morning runs- you never let it leave your side. But&ndash; but Tony, it&rsquo;s not gonnna ring. You know it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Tony stared at him, fisting his hand into his side and resisting the urge to just tell Rhodey to get the fuck out and leave him alone. He&rsquo;d known the guy for too long to think that Rhodey would ever listen to an order like that. Instead, he turned away, pushing past him and reaching over to the Whiskey once more. His fingers popped the lid with ease and he poured a generous amount into his tumbler before throwing it all back in one. Behind him, Rhodey just sighed,&nbsp;</p><p>Tony was exceptionally good at letting people down.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to give up on him someday.&rdquo; Rhodey murmured, voice gentle as he rested his hand on Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. Tony looked down at the floor stubbornly, mouth pursed tight. He didn&rsquo;t want to have this conversation. Not now, not ever</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that easy, pal,&rdquo; he laughed bitterly and shook his head, focusing on the bite of the alcohol at the back of his throat instead of the one at the back of his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know, Tony, but you just have to-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;-No, you don&rsquo;t fucking <i>get it,&rdquo;</i> Tony spun around and looked at him, shoving the hand off his shoulder and then pushing weakly at Rhodey&rsquo;s chest,&nbsp;&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s like, to be <i>that </i>in love with someone and know they won&rsquo;t ever fucking feel even a <i>tenth </i>of what you do. You&rsquo;ve never had your heart ripped out of your fucking chest by the one person that all you ever wanted to do was trust, and then watch him turn and leave for someone else.&rdquo; Tony sucked in a shaky breath, running a hand through his hair and then turning away before Rhodey could see the telltale sparkling behind his eyes. Not tonight. Not fucking tonight.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to get hurt, over and <i>over and over again,</i> and still be fucking pathetic enough to want to hold so desperately onto the last remaining piece of them. Because <i>you&rsquo;re </i>not pathetic. You&rsquo;re not a fucking idiot, not like me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He thought of those piercing blue eyes, smiling down at him across the breakfast table. The shared jokes and little touches that had sparked off a chain reaction across Tony&rsquo;s skin every damned time. He remembered every screaming match they&rsquo;d had, the ones at the very beginning when Tony had just wanted to kiss him until he shut his goddamned mouth, and then the ones later, when Tony had screamed himself hoarse because Steve was <i>reckless </i>and <i>stupid </i>and scared the shit out of him every time he threw himself into the line of fire.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d always loved Steve, even when he&rsquo;d hated him. But it had never been something that was reciprocated. At most, Tony would have been Steve&rsquo;s halfway house. His&nbsp;&lsquo;this is the best you can get for now&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>That was all Tony ever would be, really. To Steve- to anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Rhodey opened his mouth to say something else, but Tony smacked a hand through the air and swallowed down the lump in his throat. His hand curled around the neck of the bottle as he swiped it off the table and began to back away.&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck off, Rhodey,&rdquo; he said with a wave,&nbsp;&ldquo;I have work to do.

He never asks Steve if he can hear Tony\u2019s heart, doesn\u2019t want to put it out in the open. He\u2019s too scared of being rejected by the Super Soldier, too scared of ruining what they have because of feelings that probably aren\u2019t returned.</p><p>Steve\u2019s jerked from sleep when he hears FRIDAY speak.

Sighing, he makes his way down to Tony\u2019s personal lab and heads in, finding that Tony is, indeed, asleep at his desk with his face pressed against the surface of the table. Steve smiles softly and pulls the man to his feet, pulling him close to his own body so he doesn\u2019t fall. It jostles Tony enough to wake him, and he meets Steve\u2019s eyes then looks down at where his chest is pressed against Steve\u2019s. Steve frowns, because he can feel the rythmic beat of Tony\u2019s heart quicken so rapidly Steve is worried something is wrong. And then he looks at Tony and Tony looks at him, so he whispers softly as he begins pulling Tony upstairs to the penthouse and to his room. <span style=\"color: #7c5cff\"><b>\u201cYour heart is pounding, Tony.\u201d</b></span><b> </b>Tony nods slightly, still half asleep, and his head drops to rest against Steve\u2019s shoulder as he mumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>Steve looks down at him in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d Tony looks up at him and yawns, and it\u2019s clear that he has no filter from his brain to his mouth due to exhaustion. \u201cYou and your perfect smile and laugh. You\u2019re too cute for your own good, you know that?\u201d Steve smiles gently and resumes leading Tony to his room as he replies, \u201cThank you, Tony. I think you\u2019re pretty cute yourself.\u201d As they make it to Tony\u2019s room, the man reaches up to kiss Steve\u2019s cheek before patting it, yawning widely, and flopping face first onto the bed, snoring lightly. Steve blinks, then chuckles, and walks back to his room, touching his cheek lightly as he goes.</p><p>When Tony wakes up the next afternoon, after a well deserved 7 hours of sleep, he groans as the memories of Steve helping him to bed coming flooding to the front of his mind. He called Steve cute. He kissed Steve. Steve called <i>him</i> cute. Tony groans again, because he knows Steve is going to make him sit down and talk about it. He showers and changes into clean clothes, then opens his door with the intention of going out to the kitchen to eat, when he comes face to face with Steve. Steve doesn\u2019t give Tony the chance to even begin to explain, just pushes Tony back inside his room, kicking the door shut, and grasps his face in between his hands.</p><p>Before Tony can ask what\u2019s happening, Steve presses his lips against Tony\u2019s gently.
