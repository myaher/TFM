        "body": "<p>Here are my predictions for 3a (mostly the 9 or so episodes the trailer included). When I talk about a specific episode I\u2019m just going by their filming and break schedule but keep in mind that I could well be mistaken about the timing of some events. I\u2019m putting this under a read more due to length and potential spoilers.</p><!-- more --><p>I\u2019ll start with Tyrus. I think we\u2019ll get Cyrus mentioning hanging out with TJ in ep 1 and probably another mention or two of him before TJ returns. If we get Cyrus allowed to talk about his crush before TJ returns in ep 5 I think it would be in ep 4.\u00a0I do think the audience needs to hear that Cyrus has a crush on TJ before the dirt bike scene occurs so the angst really hits.\u00a0</p><p>I think the dirt bike scene is in ep 5 which should be TJ\u2019s first ep back. I\u2019m going to be cynical and say that the dirt bike scene and Tyrus getting together happen in the same ep. I don\u2019t think Disney will allow Cyrus\u2019 sexuality to be the B plot for more than two eps\u00a0 as we saw in S2 where it only got focus in 2x01 and 2x13. In 3a that would mean getting together with TJ probably in ep 5 and coming out to his parents at the funeral in ep 11.\u00a0</p><p>As for the dirt bike scene I think the blonde biker boy won\u2019t be gay. He will be friendly enough with Cyrus to make TJ jealous but not flirty enough that most of the audience thinks that there\u2019s a 3rd gay character. He\u2019s just a plot device like Natalie was and I think he\u2019ll only appear in the one ep and not get all that much screentime, a scene or two at the most. If Tyrus were a straight couple I could see the blonde biker boy chatting with Cyrus and then apologize for interrupting while Cyrus says he wasn\u2019t and TJ says he was but that seems wildly out of bounds for what Disney would allow. So who knows what Terri will be allowed to write for that scene.</p><p>I do think TJ\u2019s reaction is meant to be read as jealousy by the audience. They wouldn\u2019t have made another blonde jock to chat with Cyrus in TJ\u2019s presence otherwise. Looking back at 2x01 (really 1x13) Cyrus was allowed to be jealous of Andi and Jonah while they were getting together and later tell Buffy that while coming out but he was never allowed to show any jealousy again. If Cyrus who is ostensibly a main character wasn\u2019t allowed to be jealous any longer than the plot required than I don\u2019t think recurring character TJ can have a drawn out jealousy plot. The blonde biker boy is clearly meant to be the inciting incident for TJ and Cyrus to talk about their feelings and I think it has to come at the end of the same episode although I would love to be proven wrong.\u00a0</p><p>Even if it lasts two eps they have to get together fairly quickly so we can actually see them dating so Cyrus\u2019 decision to come out to his parents at the funeral in ep 11 by telling them he\u2019s dating TJ doesn\u2019t come off as rushed or impulsive.\u00a0</p><p>Funnily enough the only couple we\u2019ve actually seen get together on screen has been Jonah and Andi in 2x01. I think in general that Terri\u2019s best best to getting Tyrus moments approved is to recycle straight ship moments that Disney has already approved. And from a story telling perspective it would make sense to have Cyrus no longer being on the outside looking in but finally getting to have someone he likes tell him that he likes him back.\u00a0 Whether they\u2019ll go so far as to copy the dialogue,\u00a0\u2018\u2019It\u2019s crazy that you\u2019d ever be jealous of me talking to that guy\u201d,\u00a0\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy Cyrus, I was jealous\u2019\u2019 I don\u2019t know but Terri does like to copy her own work. I do think we\u2019ll see that same double hand holding and they\u2019ll be alone when it happens. Disney will want a nice coming out scene so they can get good press and win another GLAAD award.</p><p>Every other time Cyrus discussed his crush on Jonah or his situation with Iris, it was always with Buffy or Buffy was there. I think Buffy will likely be with Cyrus briefly discussing TJ\u2019s odd reaction to the blonde biker before TJ shows up and asks to talk to Cyrus and she leaves. I\u2019d hope that when TJ and Cyrus come out to each other they reference some of their moments together like the muffin scene or the swing set scene but it\u2019s hard to tell what exactly Terri will be allowed to write.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Tyrus will be allowed captial d Drama like the het ships. They\u2019ll likely have some brief lowercase d drama from time to time but actual drama would mean that Cyrus is getting higher than usual screen time in an ep and that Disney was okay with putting extra focus on the gay characters. I think 2x22 is a good example of how canon Tyrus will go for the most part, some brief drama but for the most part they\u2019re happy in the background. I do think we\u2019ll hear Cyrus mention meeting TJ\u2019s parents at some point but I\u2019d be surprised if we ever meet them. Disney can\u2019t treat Tyrus too poorly compared to the het ships so we\u2019ll see hand holding and cute moments and they\u2019ll be able to call each other boy friend but beyond that it will be a real struggle for Terri to get more substantial moments approved.\u00a0</p><p>When TJ\u2019s not in an ep Cyrus will mostly be stuck in the same comic relief /meddling therapist role he\u2019s been in all series long. I\u2019d like to say that dance class is part of some long term plot but given that Josh isn\u2019t a great dancer irl I don\u2019t think they\u2019d dedicate the time to actually training him to be a dancer on the level of Sofia or Peyton. The cop scene in the promo is definitely misleading. Either the cop is telling Cyrus he can\u2019t skip gym anymore and that leads him to the dance class or it\u2019s to ask Cyrus to make some PSA. I also think that the cafeteria scene with sad/angry TJ and a sad Cyrus is also misleading editing, either it\u2019s not a Tyrus scene at all or if it is it\u2019s not that angsty and it\u2019s not related to the blonde biker boy.\u00a0I\u2019ll also throw out that Cyrus will probably refer to himself as sassy at some point in 3a and looking long term I don\u2019t think Cyrus or anyone else will use the word gay. I also think we\u2019ll get a mention or two of Cyrus\u2019 Bubbe who is the most likely candidate to die this half season. If I had to guess I\u2019d say that her death will come as a complete shock to Cyrus.</p><p>What will get capital d Drama is Wuffy vs Wandi. Muffy is clearly endgame so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be spending much time on selling Wuffy. I do think the tension between Andi and Buffy will last for most of 3a though it will wax and wane. The show can\u2019t survive if it permanently damages Andi and Buffy\u2019s friendship so Walker will have to be sacrificed on that altar. In ep 3 after he interrupts their group hang I think he goes to Andi\u2019s apartment to talk to her alone and let her know that he still likes her and that he wants another chance with her which Andi obviously rejects then he leaves and we end the ep with Andi crying on her couch as she struggles with the central dilemma of the episode: how does she tell Buffy? I\u2019ll also predict that the tag will be an absolute dumpster fire after ep 3 airs.</p><p>Walker\u2019s last ep is either ep 6 or 10. In ep 6 at the canoe scene while him and Andi and Buffy are all together I expect Andi to reveal the truth and Wuffy will be if not sunk at least capsized. If Walker is in ep 10 I\u2019m hoping that he and Buffy can end things on a more positive note that doesn\u2019t leave Walker as a villain. Since this is after Marty\u2019s return maybe Buffy understands why Walker thought that Andi was the right one for him. Regardless of the specifics I expect this to be the messiest plot of 3a.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if the Jonah and Cyrus canoe scene will be super important but they might use it as an opportunity to talk about Cyrus and TJ and show what a good straight ally Jonah is. I do think it\u2019s important that they showcase that Jonah and Cyrus are in fact friends, especially now that it\u2019s\u00a0\u2018safe\u2019 to do so with TJ back in the picture. I also think we\u2019ll get Jonah mentioning to Cyrus that it was TJ who found Jonah and got Norman, eps 2, 4, or 6 all seem like good times to bring it up.</p><p>Buffy\u2019s basketball team plot may touch on some of the struggles with funding that Buffy alluded to in the mobile app texts and that may be the central conflict with Metcalfe when he returns in ep 6. I\u2019d have to assume that Raquel Justice\u2019s character is meant to be a foil for Buffy although it does look like she\u2019s redeemed/brought into the fold in the mid season finale so I don\u2019t think she does anything to bad. Maybe she\u2019s just like S1 Buffy was, not a team player and hyper competitive. I fully expect the girls team plot line to end later in 3b with them winning the championship and Buffy making Raquel\u2019s character the new captain.\u00a0</p><p>Marty\u2019s return will I think mark a turning point in Buffy\u2019s story line where things start to get back on track. I think Cyrus may be involved in trying to get them to talk again as he loves meddling and may consider himself a relationship expert now that he\u2019s dating TJ. I don\u2019t think Buffy is quite ready to forgive Marty for icing her out/ready to start feeling something for him in ep 8, I think that comes after getting possible closure with Walker and after doing some reflecting at the funeral but I\u2019m sure they reconcile in the mid season finale and Muffy sails at some point in 3b. I also think it\u2019s likely that Marty will get a last name at some point.\u00a0</p><p>Back in 2x03 the show made a point to emphasize that TJ didn\u2019t know Marty\u2019s name so I wonder if we\u2019ll get a call back to that or Marty sees TJ and Cyrus walk off hand in hand while talking to Buffy and realizes how much he has missed.\u00a0</p><p>Jandi will be fine. Whatever mishap Jonah has in ep 2 will be resolved in their heart to heart and the embarrassment he causes Andi in ep 4 will also be resolved by the end of that ep when he re sings the song. I know a lot of people have been pinning their hopes on Asher not being seen on set with the bracelet but I think what will happen is that at some point in 3a the bracelet is broken or lost but this time Andi and Jonah get through it together in a,\u2019\u2019we don\u2019t need the bracelet to be us\u2019\u2019 kind of way. They\u2019ll certainly have drama but they\u2019re endgame. I hope that Jonah tells Andi about his panic attacks in ep 2 or 4. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll actually start seeing a doctor, that may have to wait until after he runs into Norman Goodman again at the funeral.</p><p>Millie\u2019s character is Jonah\u2019s younger sister and I think the promo was being super misleading and it\u2019s likely that Andi meets her before that scene of Millie and Jonah outside the school. She\u2019s not in very many eps and it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019ll be back in 3b but we\u2019ll get some good rep and it looks like in ep 7 there\u2019s some sort of sign language/deaf awareness event going on at a park that the GHC and TJ attend.\u00a0</p><p>We also get a flashback to young Jonah in what\u2019s most likely ep 7 but whether it\u2019s to something important like a scene with a family member or something stupid like the first time he played ultimate I can\u2019t say. I do think it\u2019s likely at some point in S3 that we learn the origin of docious magacious, which I imagine is something Jonah learned from a beloved and now dead grandparent.\u00a0</p><p>Amber seems like has some significant screen time in 3a so I wonder if she finishes an arc in the mid season finale and then has much less screen time in 3b or if the writers have bigger plans for her. We know in ep 7 that her and Andi sneak into a high school party later the same day of the sign language event and that Bowie, who is probably at a hipster party runs into them. That Andi is hanging out with Amber is a clue imo that her and Buffy are still on rocky terms. I also expect Amber to have more scenes with Cyrus, I\u2019m sure Disney would like Cyrus to have as much screen time with girls as possible. Hopefully she apologizes to Jonah for her ill treatment of him and hopefully she and her family\u2019s financial situation improves.\u00a0</p><p>Bexie are endgame obviously. They\u2019ll get engaged in ep 2 and get married in the season and series finale but what happens in between I have no idea. I think that whatever Terri may have wanted to do with Gabriel had to be scrapped in S2 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see him appear. I do think we need to see some of Bowie\u2019s family at some point before the wedding. I do think that at some point we\u2019ll see Bex and Bowie really have to set boundaries with Andi which results in a huge fight.</p><p>Celia and Ham will be fine but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see much of Ham. I have no idea what Celia will be doing aside from running Cloud 10. I think the end point for her is to decide to travel the world with Ham and give the house to Bex, Bowie, and Andi but what happens in between is a big mystery.\u00a0</p>",

If I had to guess I\u2019d say that her death will come as a complete shock to Cyrus.</p><p>What will get capital d Drama is Wuffy vs Wandi. Muffy is clearly endgame so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be spending much time on selling Wuffy. I do think the tension between Andi and Buffy will last for most of 3a though it will wax and wane. The show can\u2019t survive if it permanently damages Andi and Buffy\u2019s friendship so Walker will have to be sacrificed on that altar. In ep 3 after he interrupts their group hang I think he goes to Andi\u2019s apartment to talk to her alone and let her know that he still likes her and that he wants another chance with her which Andi obviously rejects then he leaves and we end the ep with Andi crying on her couch as she struggles with the central dilemma of the episode: how does she tell Buffy? I\u2019ll also predict that the tag will be an absolute dumpster fire after ep 3 airs.</p><p>Walker\u2019s last ep is either ep 6 or 10. In ep 6 at the canoe scene while him and Andi and Buffy are all together I expect Andi to reveal the truth and Wuffy will be if not sunk at least capsized. If Walker is in ep 10 I\u2019m hoping that he and Buffy can end things on a more positive note that doesn\u2019t leave Walker as a villain. Since this is after Marty\u2019s return maybe Buffy understands why Walker thought that Andi was the right one for him. Regardless of the specifics I expect this to be the messiest plot of 3a.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if the Jonah and Cyrus canoe scene will be super important but they might use it as an opportunity to talk about Cyrus and TJ and show what a good straight ally Jonah is. I do think it\u2019s important that they showcase that Jonah and Cyrus are in fact friends, especially now that it\u2019s\u00a0\u2018safe\u2019 to do so with TJ back in the picture. I also think we\u2019ll get Jonah mentioning to Cyrus that it was TJ who found Jonah and got Norman, eps 2, 4, or 6 all seem like good times to bring it up.</p><p>Buffy\u2019s basketball team plot may touch on some of the struggles with funding that Buffy alluded to in the mobile app texts and that may be the central conflict with Metcalfe when he returns in ep 6. I\u2019d have to assume that Raquel Justice\u2019s character is meant to be a foil for Buffy although it does look like she\u2019s redeemed/brought into the fold in the mid season finale so I don\u2019t think she does anything to bad. Maybe she\u2019s just like S1 Buffy was, not a team player and hyper competitive. I fully expect the girls team plot line to end later in 3b with them winning the championship and Buffy making Raquel\u2019s character the new captain.\u00a0</p><p>Marty\u2019s return will I think mark a turning point in Buffy\u2019s story line where things start to get back on track. I think Cyrus may be involved in trying to get them to talk again as he loves meddling and may consider himself a relationship expert now that he\u2019s dating TJ. I don\u2019t think Buffy is quite ready to forgive Marty for icing her out/ready to start feeling something for him in ep 8, I think that comes after getting possible closure with Walker and after doing some reflecting at the funeral but I\u2019m sure they reconcile in the mid season finale and Muffy sails at some point in 3b. I also think it\u2019s likely that Marty will get a last name at some point.\u00a0</p><p>Back in 2x03 the show made a point to emphasize that TJ didn\u2019t know Marty\u2019s name so I wonder if we\u2019ll get a call back to that or Marty sees TJ and Cyrus walk off hand in hand while talking to Buffy and realizes how much he has missed.\u00a0</p><p>Jandi will be fine. Whatever mishap Jonah has in ep 2 will be resolved in their heart to heart and the embarrassment he causes Andi in ep 4 will also be resolved by the end of that ep when he re sings the song. I know a lot of people have been pinning their hopes on Asher not being seen on set with the bracelet but I think what will happen is that at some point in 3a the bracelet is broken or lost but this time Andi and Jonah get through it together in a,\u2019\u2019we don\u2019t need the bracelet to be us\u2019\u2019 kind of way. They\u2019ll certainly have drama but they\u2019re endgame. I hope that Jonah tells Andi about his panic attacks in ep 2 or 4. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll actually start seeing a doctor, that may have to wait until after he runs into Norman Goodman again at the funeral.</p><p>Millie\u2019s character is Jonah\u2019s younger sister and I think the promo was being super misleading and it\u2019s likely that Andi meets her before that scene of Millie and Jonah outside the school. She\u2019s not in very many eps and it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019ll be back in 3b but we\u2019ll get some good rep and it looks like in ep 7 there\u2019s some sort of sign language/deaf awareness event going on at a park that the GHC and TJ attend.\u00a0</p><p>We also get a flashback to young Jonah in what\u2019s most likely ep 7 but whether it\u2019s to something important like a scene with a family member or something stupid like the first time he played ultimate I can\u2019t say. I do think it\u2019s likely at some point in S3 that we learn the origin of docious magacious, which I imagine is something Jonah learned from a beloved and now dead grandparent.\u00a0</p><p>Amber seems like has some significant screen time in 3a so I wonder if she finishes an arc in the mid season finale and then has much less screen time in 3b or if the writers have bigger plans for her. We know in ep 7 that her and Andi sneak into a high school party later the same day of the sign language event and that Bowie, who is probably at a hipster party runs into them. That Andi is hanging out with Amber is a clue imo that her and Buffy are still on rocky terms. I also expect Amber to have more scenes with Cyrus, I\u2019m sure Disney would like Cyrus to have as much screen time with girls as possible. Hopefully she apologizes to Jonah for her ill treatment of him and hopefully she and her family\u2019s financial situation improves.\u00a0</p><p>Bexie are endgame obviously. They\u2019ll get engaged in ep 2 and get married in the season and series finale but what happens in between I have no idea. I think that whatever Terri may have wanted to do with Gabriel had to be scrapped in S2 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see him appear. I do think we need to see some of Bowie\u2019s family at some point before the wedding. I do think that at some point we\u2019ll see Bex and Bowie really have to set boundaries with Andi which results in a huge fight.</p><p>Celia and Ham will be fine but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see much of Ham. I have no idea what Celia will be doing aside from running Cloud 10. I think the end point for her is to decide to travel the world with Ham and give the house to Bex, Bowie, and Andi but what happens in between is a big mystery.\u00a0</p>",

When I talk about a specific episode I\u2019m just going by their filming and break schedule but keep in mind that I could well be mistaken about the timing of some events. I\u2019m putting this under a read more due to length and potential spoilers.</p>[[MORE]]<p>I\u2019ll start with Tyrus. I think we\u2019ll get Cyrus mentioning hanging out with TJ in ep 1 and probably another mention or two of him before TJ returns. If we get Cyrus allowed to talk about his crush before TJ returns in ep 5 I think it would be in ep 4.\u00a0I do think the audience needs to hear that Cyrus has a crush on TJ before the dirt bike scene occurs so the angst really hits.\u00a0</p><p>I think the dirt bike scene is in ep 5 which should be TJ\u2019s first ep back. I\u2019m going to be cynical and say that the dirt bike scene and Tyrus getting together happen in the same ep. I don\u2019t think Disney will allow Cyrus\u2019 sexuality to be the B plot for more than two eps\u00a0 as we saw in S2 where it only got focus in 2x01 and 2x13. In 3a that would mean getting together with TJ probably in ep 5 and coming out to his parents at the funeral in ep 11.\u00a0</p><p>As for the dirt bike scene I think the blonde biker boy won\u2019t be gay. He will be friendly enough with Cyrus to make TJ jealous but not flirty enough that most of the audience thinks that there\u2019s a 3rd gay character. He\u2019s just a plot device like Natalie was and I think he\u2019ll only appear in the one ep and not get all that much screentime, a scene or two at the most. If Tyrus were a straight couple I could see the blonde biker boy chatting with Cyrus and then apologize for interrupting while Cyrus says he wasn\u2019t and TJ says he was but that seems wildly out of bounds for what Disney would allow. So who knows what Terri will be allowed to write for that scene.</p><p>I do think TJ\u2019s reaction is meant to be read as jealousy by the audience. They wouldn\u2019t have made another blonde jock to chat with Cyrus in TJ\u2019s presence otherwise. Looking back at 2x01 (really 1x13) Cyrus was allowed to be jealous of Andi and Jonah while they were getting together and later tell Buffy that while coming out but he was never allowed to show any jealousy again. If Cyrus who is ostensibly a main character wasn\u2019t allowed to be jealous any longer than the plot required than I don\u2019t think recurring character TJ can have a drawn out jealousy plot. The blonde biker boy is clearly meant to be the inciting incident for TJ and Cyrus to talk about their feelings and I think it has to come at the end of the same episode although I would love to be proven wrong.\u00a0</p><p>Even if it lasts two eps they have to get together fairly quickly so we can actually see them dating so Cyrus\u2019 decision to come out to his parents at the funeral in ep 11 by telling them he\u2019s dating TJ doesn\u2019t come off as rushed or impulsive.\u00a0</p><p>Funnily enough the only couple we\u2019ve actually seen get together on screen has been Jonah and Andi in 2x01. I think in general that Terri\u2019s best best to getting Tyrus moments approved is to recycle straight ship moments that Disney has already approved. And from a story telling perspective it would make sense to have Cyrus no longer being on the outside looking in but finally getting to have someone he likes tell him that he likes him back.\u00a0 Whether they\u2019ll go so far as to copy the dialogue,\u00a0\u2018\u2019It\u2019s crazy that you\u2019d ever be jealous of me talking to that guy\u201d,\u00a0\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy Cyrus, I was jealous\u2019\u2019 I don\u2019t know but Terri does like to copy her own work. I do think we\u2019ll see that same double hand holding and they\u2019ll be alone when it happens. Disney will want a nice coming out scene so they can get good press and win another GLAAD award.</p><p>Every other time Cyrus discussed his crush on Jonah or his situation with Iris, it was always with Buffy or Buffy was there. I think Buffy will likely be with Cyrus briefly discussing TJ\u2019s odd reaction to the blonde biker before TJ shows up and asks to talk to Cyrus and she leaves. I\u2019d hope that when TJ and Cyrus come out to each other they reference some of their moments together like the muffin scene or the swing set scene but it\u2019s hard to tell what exactly Terri will be allowed to write.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Tyrus will be allowed captial d Drama like the het ships. They\u2019ll likely have some brief lowercase d drama from time to time but actual drama would mean that Cyrus is getting higher than usual screen time in an ep and that Disney was okay with putting extra focus on the gay characters. I think 2x22 is a good example of how canon Tyrus will go for the most part, some brief drama but for the most part they\u2019re happy in the background. I do think we\u2019ll hear Cyrus mention meeting TJ\u2019s parents at some point but I\u2019d be surprised if we ever meet them. Disney can\u2019t treat Tyrus too poorly compared to the het ships so we\u2019ll see hand holding and cute moments and they\u2019ll be able to call each other boy friend but beyond that it will be a real struggle for Terri to get more substantial moments approved.\u00a0</p><p>When TJ\u2019s not in an ep Cyrus will mostly be stuck in the same comic relief /meddling therapist role he\u2019s been in all series long. I\u2019d like to say that dance class is part of some long term plot but given that Josh isn\u2019t a great dancer irl I don\u2019t think they\u2019d dedicate the time to actually training him to be a dancer on the level of Sofia or Peyton. The cop scene in the promo is definitely misleading. Either the cop is telling Cyrus he can\u2019t skip gym anymore and that leads him to the dance class or it\u2019s to ask Cyrus to make some PSA. I also think that the cafeteria scene with sad/angry TJ and a sad Cyrus is also misleading editing, either it\u2019s not a Tyrus scene at all or if it is it\u2019s not that angsty and it\u2019s not related to the blonde biker boy.\u00a0I\u2019ll also throw out that Cyrus will probably refer to himself as sassy at some point in 3a and looking long term I don\u2019t think Cyrus or anyone else will use the word gay. I also think we\u2019ll get a mention or two of Cyrus\u2019 Bubbe who is the most likely candidate to die this half season. If I had to guess I\u2019d say that her death will come as a complete shock to Cyrus.</p><p>What will get capital d Drama is Wuffy vs Wandi. Muffy is clearly endgame so I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be spending much time on selling Wuffy. I do think the tension between Andi and Buffy will last for most of 3a though it will wax and wane. The show can\u2019t survive if it permanently damages Andi and Buffy\u2019s friendship so Walker will have to be sacrificed on that altar. In ep 3 after he interrupts their group hang I think he goes to Andi\u2019s apartment to talk to her alone and let her know that he still likes her and that he wants another chance with her which Andi obviously rejects then he leaves and we end the ep with Andi crying on her couch as she struggles with the central dilemma of the episode: how does she tell Buffy? I\u2019ll also predict that the tag will be an absolute dumpster fire after ep 3 airs.</p><p>Walker\u2019s last ep is either ep 6 or 10. In ep 6 at the canoe scene while him and Andi and Buffy are all together I expect Andi to reveal the truth and Wuffy will be if not sunk at least capsized. If Walker is in ep 10 I\u2019m hoping that he and Buffy can end things on a more positive note that doesn\u2019t leave Walker as a villain. Since this is after Marty\u2019s return maybe Buffy understands why Walker thought that Andi was the right one for him. Regardless of the specifics I expect this to be the messiest plot of 3a.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if the Jonah and Cyrus canoe scene will be super important but they might use it as an opportunity to talk about Cyrus and TJ and show what a good straight ally Jonah is.

I have no idea what Celia will be doing aside from running Cloud 10.

Disney will want a nice coming out scene so they can get good press and win another GLAAD award.</p><p>Every other time Cyrus discussed his crush on Jonah or his situation with Iris, it was always with Buffy or Buffy was there. I think Buffy will likely be with Cyrus briefly discussing TJ&rsquo;s odd reaction to the blonde biker before TJ shows up and asks to talk to Cyrus and she leaves. I&rsquo;d hope that when TJ and Cyrus come out to each other they reference some of their moments together like the muffin scene or the swing set scene but it&rsquo;s hard to tell what exactly Terri will be allowed to write.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think Tyrus will be allowed captial d Drama like the het ships. They&rsquo;ll likely have some brief lowercase d drama from time to time but actual drama would mean that Cyrus is getting higher than usual screen time in an ep and that Disney was okay with putting extra focus on the gay characters. I think 2x22 is a good example of how canon Tyrus will go for the most part, some brief drama but for the most part they&rsquo;re happy in the background. I do think we&rsquo;ll hear Cyrus mention meeting TJ&rsquo;s parents at some point but I&rsquo;d be surprised if we ever meet them. Disney can&rsquo;t treat Tyrus too poorly compared to the het ships so we&rsquo;ll see hand holding and cute moments and they&rsquo;ll be able to call each other boy friend but beyond that it will be a real struggle for Terri to get more substantial moments approved.&nbsp;</p><p>When TJ&rsquo;s not in an ep Cyrus will mostly be stuck in the same comic relief /meddling therapist role he&rsquo;s been in all series long. I&rsquo;d like to say that dance class is part of some long term plot but given that Josh isn&rsquo;t a great dancer irl I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d dedicate the time to actually training him to be a dancer on the level of Sofia or Peyton. The cop scene in the promo is definitely misleading. Either the cop is telling Cyrus he can&rsquo;t skip gym anymore and that leads him to the dance class or it&rsquo;s to ask Cyrus to make some PSA. I also think that the cafeteria scene with sad/angry TJ and a sad Cyrus is also misleading editing, either it&rsquo;s not a Tyrus scene at all or if it is it&rsquo;s not that angsty and it&rsquo;s not related to the blonde biker boy.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll also throw out that Cyrus will probably refer to himself as sassy at some point in 3a and looking long term I don&rsquo;t think Cyrus or anyone else will use the word gay. I also think we&rsquo;ll get a mention or two of Cyrus&rsquo; Bubbe who is the most likely candidate to die this half season. If I had to guess I&rsquo;d say that her death will come as a complete shock to Cyrus.</p><p>What will get capital d Drama is Wuffy vs Wandi. Muffy is clearly endgame so I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be spending much time on selling Wuffy. I do think the tension between Andi and Buffy will last for most of 3a though it will wax and wane. The show can&rsquo;t survive if it permanently damages Andi and Buffy&rsquo;s friendship so Walker will have to be sacrificed on that altar. In ep 3 after he interrupts their group hang I think he goes to Andi&rsquo;s apartment to talk to her alone and let her know that he still likes her and that he wants another chance with her which Andi obviously rejects then he leaves and we end the ep with Andi crying on her couch as she struggles with the central dilemma of the episode: how does she tell Buffy? I&rsquo;ll also predict that the tag will be an absolute dumpster fire after ep 3 airs.</p><p>Walker&rsquo;s last ep is either ep 6 or 10. In ep 6 at the canoe scene while him and Andi and Buffy are all together I expect Andi to reveal the truth and Wuffy will be if not sunk at least capsized. If Walker is in ep 10 I&rsquo;m hoping that he and Buffy can end things on a more positive note that doesn&rsquo;t leave Walker as a villain. Since this is after Marty&rsquo;s return maybe Buffy understands why Walker thought that Andi was the right one for him. Regardless of the specifics I expect this to be the messiest plot of 3a.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the Jonah and Cyrus canoe scene will be super important but they might use it as an opportunity to talk about Cyrus and TJ and show what a good straight ally Jonah is. I do think it&rsquo;s important that they showcase that Jonah and Cyrus are in fact friends, especially now that it&rsquo;s&nbsp;&lsquo;safe&rsquo; to do so with TJ back in the picture. I also think we&rsquo;ll get Jonah mentioning to Cyrus that it was TJ who found Jonah and got Norman, eps 2, 4, or 6 all seem like good times to bring it up.</p><p>Buffy&rsquo;s basketball team plot may touch on some of the struggles with funding that Buffy alluded to in the mobile app texts and that may be the central conflict with Metcalfe when he returns in ep 6. I&rsquo;d have to assume that Raquel Justice&rsquo;s character is meant to be a foil for Buffy although it does look like she&rsquo;s redeemed/brought into the fold in the mid season finale so I don&rsquo;t think she does anything to bad. Maybe she&rsquo;s just like S1 Buffy was, not a team player and hyper competitive. I fully expect the girls team plot line to end later in 3b with them winning the championship and Buffy making Raquel&rsquo;s character the new captain.&nbsp;</p><p>Marty&rsquo;s return will I think mark a turning point in Buffy&rsquo;s story line where things start to get back on track. I think Cyrus may be involved in trying to get them to talk again as he loves meddling and may consider himself a relationship expert now that he&rsquo;s dating TJ. I don&rsquo;t think Buffy is quite ready to forgive Marty for icing her out/ready to start feeling something for him in ep 8, I think that comes after getting possible closure with Walker and after doing some reflecting at the funeral but I&rsquo;m sure they reconcile in the mid season finale and Muffy sails at some point in 3b. I also think it&rsquo;s likely that Marty will get a last name at some point.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2x03 the show made a point to emphasize that TJ didn&rsquo;t know Marty&rsquo;s name so I wonder if we&rsquo;ll get a call back to that or Marty sees TJ and Cyrus walk off hand in hand while talking to Buffy and realizes how much he has missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Jandi will be fine. Whatever mishap Jonah has in ep 2 will be resolved in their heart to heart and the embarrassment he causes Andi in ep 4 will also be resolved by the end of that ep when he re sings the song. I know a lot of people have been pinning their hopes on Asher not being seen on set with the bracelet but I think what will happen is that at some point in 3a the bracelet is broken or lost but this time Andi and Jonah get through it together in a,&rsquo;&rsquo;we don&rsquo;t need the bracelet to be us&rsquo;&rsquo; kind of way. They&rsquo;ll certainly have drama but they&rsquo;re endgame. I hope that Jonah tells Andi about his panic attacks in ep 2 or 4. I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;ll actually start seeing a doctor, that may have to wait until after he runs into Norman Goodman again at the funeral.</p><p>Millie&rsquo;s character is Jonah&rsquo;s younger sister and I think the promo was being super misleading and it&rsquo;s likely that Andi meets her before that scene of Millie and Jonah outside the school. She&rsquo;s not in very many eps and it doesn&rsquo;t seem like she&rsquo;ll be back in 3b but we&rsquo;ll get some good rep and it looks like in ep 7 there&rsquo;s some sort of sign language/deaf awareness event going on at a park that the GHC and TJ attend.&nbsp;</p><p>We also get a flashback to young Jonah in what&rsquo;s most likely ep 7 but whether it&rsquo;s to something important like a scene with a family member or something stupid like the first time he played ultimate I can&rsquo;t say. I do think it&rsquo;s likely at some point in S3 that we learn the origin of docious magacious, which I imagine is something Jonah learned from a beloved and now dead grandparent.&nbsp;</p><p>Amber seems like has some significant screen time in 3a so I wonder if she finishes an arc in the mid season finale and then has much less screen time in 3b or if the writers have bigger plans for her. We know in ep 7 that her and Andi sneak into a high school party later the same day of the sign language event and that Bowie, who is probably at a hipster party runs into them. That Andi is hanging out with Amber is a clue imo that her and Buffy are still on rocky terms. I also expect Amber to have more scenes with Cyrus, I&rsquo;m sure Disney would like Cyrus to have as much screen time with girls as possible. Hopefully she apologizes to Jonah for her ill treatment of him and hopefully she and her family&rsquo;s financial situation improves.&nbsp;</p><p>Bexie are endgame obviously. They&rsquo;ll get engaged in ep 2 and get married in the season and series finale but what happens in between I have no idea. I think that whatever Terri may have wanted to do with Gabriel had to be scrapped in S2 and I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see him appear. I do think we need to see some of Bowie&rsquo;s family at some point before the wedding. I do think that at some point we&rsquo;ll see Bex and Bowie really have to set boundaries with Andi which results in a huge fight.</p><p>Celia and Ham will be fine but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see much of Ham. I have no idea what Celia will be doing aside from running Cloud 10. I think the end point for her is to decide to travel the world with Ham and give the house to Bex, Bowie, and Andi but what happens in between is a big mystery.&nbsp;</p>",

See, Jandi is in no way unique. Not just in terms of it\u2019s awfulness, but more broadly in the story beats it follows. The set up is a tale as old as time: Main Girl has crush on Main Guy but Main Guy already has Pretty Mean Girlfriend who serves as an obstacle for are usually bland hetero couple to deal with, but in the end despite their struggles the two unintersting kids with little to nothing in common start dating. Now there are numerous problems with scenario and to understand why this plotline is so troubling you\u2019d have to go through all the problems with it. Which is exactly what we\u2019re gonna do!</p><p>If I sound a bit cynical, than that\u2019s because I am. In all seriousness, it is quite the overused plotline, but honestly it\u2019s actually done fairly well in Andi Mack. As good as it really can be while still maintaining to the basic structure of it. One thing that\u2019s done extremely well with Jandi is Amber. Amber\u2019s character in season one, while still having the enjoyably entertaining moments of high school cruelty, has a lot more depth than her contemporaries. For one there\u2019s her age. The fact that Amber is in high school and is in a sense above Jonah leads to a rather interesting dynamic between them. See, Amber definitely treats Jonah in poor ways, but does so in a manner that he wouldn\u2019t easily recognize. One of the biggest issues with this kind of character if they are dating the Main Guy is that the guys is essentially made out to be an idiot since they can\u2019t pick up on the obvious rudeness of the girl. Instead, they craft Jonah\u2019s character in a way for it to be completely understandable why he\u2019s so willing to defend Amber. It\u2019s never been made clear in the show how those two got together, but considering Iris\u2019s comment about Amber needing a boyfriend for her own sense of self-worth, I\u2019ve always thought it went down like this: Amber, most likely having already had a boyfriend from her grade (or more than one), realized that instead of chasing after a boy her own age where she\u2019d have to compete with all the girls her age, she\u2019d pick a middle school boy who\u2019d be so grateful that an older girl noticed him that he wouldn\u2019t leave her. Pure speculation yes, but considering how the other characters treat Jonah with this almost respect for dating an older girl, I doubt the thought hadn\u2019t crossed Amber\u2019s head, considering how important it is for Jonah to be loyal to her. And Jonah was the perfect choice; not because he wants to impress other people, but because he\u2019s seemingly naturally charismatic and optimistic, traits that come together that lead to his popularity and willingness to see the good in others. That last one being particularly important as that is the huge reason for his constant defense of Amber. He wants to make those around him happy, and Amber puts on a front of vulnerability and insecurity so that he\u2019ll not only pity her but go easier on her if she messes up. I think that might be why he went along with her calling him her boyfriend, since he didn\u2019t want the label but probably felt guilty about potentially hurting her if he said no. Even after they break up, Jonah still thinks there\u2019s good in her, only giving up on this after she hurts Andi but even then not fully. And speaking of that break up, that\u2019s what really cements this part of the plot as being the best, as the show acknowledges Amber\u2019s toxic behavior and allows Jonah to confront her about it and tell her she\u2019s been manipulative. The reason this is so important is that toxic relationships in which the girl is the one being manipulative and not the boy are often treated as a joke, and despite the occasional humorous moment here and there, Jonah and Amber\u2019s relationship and the problems with it are not taken as a joke. Which is especially good considering how that it seems to be the reason that Jonah is so hesitant on starting an official relationship with Andi (though we\u2019ll get more into that next time). So how they dealt with Amber, and how she fits into the whole Jandi arc was all done pretty well, and I can honestly say the execution of it was fantastic.\u00a0</p><p>The other factors of this storyline present with Jandi aren\u2019t done that poorly either in the first season, but the only part of the formula that\u2019s twisted is how instead of just having Andi end up with Jonah once Amber\u2019s out of the way, Andi realizes that she had never even really bothered to form a friendship with him, but instead had soley focused on pursuing a romantic relationship with Jonah without any real foundation and that this approach wasn\u2019t right. Apologies since I\u2019m going to be bringing it up quite a bit, but\u00a0\u201cWere We Ever?\u201d is what made Jandi stand out from other pairings of its kind by saying\u00a0\u201cHey, these two have nothing in common with each other and their entire relationship is built upon one of them doing the emotional heavy lifting and compromise while the other doesn\u2019t put any work into the relationship and that\u2019s not a good thing.\u201d It\u2019s just so damn refreshing, especially with how much this plot is played straight in media. That being said, it\u2019s not as if Jonah and Andi couldn\u2019t have worked together. Sure, they may have not had the most in common, but since Andi was upfront about her feelings, Jonah was able to have some self-reflection and realize what he did wrong and work towards making things right. I think that would\u2019ve been a great way to start their relationship; Andi being clear about the issues she\u2019s had with Jonah and Jonah actually making the effort to fix his mistakes. That could\u2019ve been an interesting take on this story, as we so rarely see anything after they get together at the end, when the relationship itself can be far more interesting than the journey getting to that point. Well, it is if the couple in question are actually interesting together. Which Andi and Jonah are not. Aside from a few cute moments in season one, their relationship quickly became defined by angst and miscommunication, and would soon drain away any good will people might have had towards the relationship. But we\u2019ll get into that next time!</p>",

It\u2019s never been made clear in the show how those two got together, but considering Iris\u2019s comment about Amber needing a boyfriend for her own sense of self-worth, I\u2019ve always thought it went down like this: Amber, most likely having already had a boyfriend from her grade (or more than one), realized that instead of chasing after a boy her own age where she\u2019d have to compete with all the girls her age, she\u2019d pick a middle school boy who\u2019d be so grateful that an older girl noticed him that he wouldn\u2019t leave her. Pure speculation yes, but considering how the other characters treat Jonah with this almost respect for dating an older girl, I doubt the thought hadn\u2019t crossed Amber\u2019s head, considering how important it is for Jonah to be loyal to her. And Jonah was the perfect choice; not because he wants to impress other people, but because he\u2019s seemingly naturally charismatic and optimistic, traits that come together that lead to his popularity and willingness to see the good in others. That last one being particularly important as that is the huge reason for his constant defense of Amber. He wants to make those around him happy, and Amber puts on a front of vulnerability and insecurity so that he\u2019ll not only pity her but go easier on her if she messes up. I think that might be why he went along with her calling him her boyfriend, since he didn\u2019t want the label but probably felt guilty about potentially hurting her if he said no. Even after they break up, Jonah still thinks there\u2019s good in her, only giving up on this after she hurts Andi but even then not fully. And speaking of that break up, that\u2019s what really cements this part of the plot as being the best, as the show acknowledges Amber\u2019s toxic behavior and allows Jonah to confront her about it and tell her she\u2019s been manipulative. The reason this is so important is that toxic relationships in which the girl is the one being manipulative and not the boy are often treated as a joke, and despite the occasional humorous moment here and there, Jonah and Amber\u2019s relationship and the problems with it are not taken as a joke. Which is especially good considering how that it seems to be the reason that Jonah is so hesitant on starting an official relationship with Andi (though we\u2019ll get more into that next time). So how they dealt with Amber, and how she fits into the whole Jandi arc was all done pretty well, and I can honestly say the execution of it was fantastic.\u00a0</p><p>The other factors of this storyline present with Jandi aren\u2019t done that poorly either in the first season, but the only part of the formula that\u2019s twisted is how instead of just having Andi end up with Jonah once Amber\u2019s out of the way, Andi realizes that she had never even really bothered to form a friendship with him, but instead had soley focused on pursuing a romantic relationship with Jonah without any real foundation and that this approach wasn\u2019t right. Apologies since I\u2019m going to be bringing it up quite a bit, but\u00a0\u201cWere We Ever?\u201d is what made Jandi stand out from other pairings of its kind by saying\u00a0\u201cHey, these two have nothing in common with each other and their entire relationship is built upon one of them doing the emotional heavy lifting and compromise while the other doesn\u2019t put any work into the relationship and that\u2019s not a good thing.\u201d It\u2019s just so damn refreshing, especially with how much this plot is played straight in media. That being said, it\u2019s not as if Jonah and Andi couldn\u2019t have worked together. Sure, they may have not had the most in common, but since Andi was upfront about her feelings, Jonah was able to have some self-reflection and realize what he did wrong and work towards making things right. I think that would\u2019ve been a great way to start their relationship; Andi being clear about the issues she\u2019s had with Jonah and Jonah actually making the effort to fix his mistakes. That could\u2019ve been an interesting take on this story, as we so rarely see anything after they get together at the end, when the relationship itself can be far more interesting than the journey getting to that point. Well, it is if the couple in question are actually interesting together. Which Andi and Jonah are not. Aside from a few cute moments in season one, their relationship quickly became defined by angst and miscommunication, and would soon drain away any good will people might have had towards the relationship. But we\u2019ll get into that next time!</p></p>",
