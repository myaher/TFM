Maybe Iron Man is the problem. <br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/2339012/chapters/5155331\">Every Villain is a Hero (Is His Own Mind) </a>by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmzyEzzwH-0X5TZI6lWnqlw\">@awesomeavocadolove</a>: \nTony is the villain known as Iron Man. Steve is Captain America. Outside\n work, Steve and Tony are married and do not know each other&rsquo;s secret \nidentities. Some revelations, though, do not come with a happy ending.\n\n<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17078249\">Telling Truth Behind My Own Mask </a>by irondorkness: Iron Man is the bodyguard of the Avengers benefactor and mechanic, Tony Stark.Unfortunately, he tends to voice rather unpleasant opinions about his employer, which grates Steve&rsquo;s gears quite a bit.Steve thinks Tony is just great and doesn&rsquo;t deserve the harsh critizism from someone like Iron Man.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/10271720\">Many Faces, All of Them Yours </a>by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZQtCEipeINRrOqMNjIxU4w\">@cptxrogers</a>: Steve is head over heels for the team&rsquo;s benefactor \nTony, but he feels terrible for his best friend, Iron Man, who seems to \nhave developed a bit of a crush on him. And now there&rsquo;s a mysterious new\n hero, Nomad, stalking the streets of New York.An identity porn soap opera.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/7846618\">Eavesdroppers Neve</a>r by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpqVZ1xx_jVzzGYK7kRacMA\">@sineala</a>: \nWhen Tony made the decision to have a secret identity, he had several \nwell-considered and carefully thought-out reasons. But there were a few \nscenarios he never took into account. He never imagined that he, Iron \nMan, would be cuddling naked with Captain America in a Canadian shack in\n the middle of a snowstorm. He also never imagined that Captain America \nwould pick that moment to tell him, Iron Man, about his feelings for \nTony Stark. Uh-oh. <br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14829704\">If You&rsquo;d Only Knew</a> by SouldierToTheEnd:\n &nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Captain, I thought I told you to call me &lsquo;Tony.&rsquo;&rdquo;</i>\n &nbsp;<i>Steve&rsquo;s grin quickly faded once Stark turned around.</i><i>He paled. &ldquo;Mister Stark, your eye!&ldquo;</i> After seeing Tony riddled with bruises and Iron Man being evasive, Steve assumes the worst.<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8474899/chapters/19418797\">Who You Think You Are</a> by Tahruil: \nIn a world where no one knows the identity of Iron Man, Tony Stark is \nthe best thing since sliced bread, at least in the opinion of one Steve \nRogers. He doesn&rsquo;t like to let anyone know that - especially not Tony - \nbut one day it sort of slips out. Luckily it&rsquo;s only to his best friend, \nand Shellhead won&rsquo;t tell anyone. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/362129\">Bizarre Love Triangle</a> by panicyintheuk:\nOnce the idea was in his head, he&rsquo;d started picking up on all kinds of \nthings, like the way Stark talked about Iron Man with such affection, \nand seemed to share so many of his mannerisms, and was constantly \nworking on ways of improving the suit. It was obvious. <br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/13255779\">To the End of Love</a> by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4KQkkEs7XB8_c_Fj9Zy75Q\">@laireshi</a>: Steve&rsquo;s been married to Tony for years when the \nStamford disaster happens and the Superhero Registration Act tears the \nsuperhero community apart. When Tony disagrees with Steve, Steve still \nexpects Iron Man to follow him: he&rsquo;s his best friend, for one, and he&rsquo;s \nchosen to keep his identity a secret from everyone. But Iron Man also \nfights against him.And then Steve smashes his faceplate open.<br /></p>",

Silently at first until they quickly turned into loud sobs as he stared at the man until his shaking hands and watery eyes made it hard to see.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Why was he crying?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Why was he so sad?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<i>Who </i>was he?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Why</i> can&rsquo;t I remember you?&rdquo; </p></p>",

It had been five days, and Mr. Stark hadn\u2019t spoken to you since then. Part of you knew he couldn\u2019t, the lawyer you forgot the name of told you that you couldn\u2019t speak with Mr. Stark for a while because that could \u201cinterfere in the proceedings\u201d.<br/></p><p>But most of all, you\u2019re scared. What if Mr. Stark didn\u2019t want you and you would have to live with Arthur and Elizabeth again? You wouldn\u2019t even get in the front door before they would you for escaping and ending up living with <b><i>the avengers </i></b>of all people. </p><p>You sighs and looks at your watch. Friday hadn\u2019t spoken to you since, but the watch are still working. If it wasn\u2019t for that, you could swear it was all just a dream. You would swear you never had a family again. </p><!-- more --><p>The truth is, you\u2019re starting to doubt, and it sucks because maybe the feelings they had for you was just pity. Maybe they never saw you as you saw them. Maybe you just made yourself a fool again, maybe you was nothing but the homeless and starving girl Loki found. You couldn\u2019t help but start to feel tears coming. </p><p>The pain is so strong and you missed them so much, it seemed it would kill you. \u00a0All you wanted was to go back and play Monopoly and have movie nights with them. Hear Peter talk about Star Wars and spend almost all night with Mr. Stark in the lab, hearing him murmur a song that Friday was playing, too concentrated on what he was doing to notice you hiding a smile. Or even stay up reading with Pepper or see Loki\u2019s magic and learn self-defence with Buck. </p><p><i>Bucky</i>. </p><p>You touches the bracelet he gave you, feeling a tear fall. </p><p><i>This will protect me. </i></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d you hear Natalie, the woman you\u2019re staying with, knock on the door. \u201cI brought you lunch.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move from the window you\u2019re sitting in, just looking at the heavy clouds of the storm that was about to come.</p><p>Natalie peeks in with her head and looks at the sad girl watching the rain. She enters, biting her lip and put the tray on the table and walked towards you. </p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cI made chicken\u2026\u201d still no response. \u201cAren&rsquo;t you hungry? You didn&rsquo;t eat anything since yesterday\u2026 you&rsquo;ll end up sick.\u201d </p><p>She sit next to you looking for the your eyes. \u201cOr maybe get out of this room? You\u2019ve just stayed \u00a0here since you arrived\u2026 Earth to Hope&hellip;are you in there?\u201d She waves her hand lightly in front of your face. Nothing. She shifts in the same spot, still biting her lips. \u201cLook\u2026 I know you&rsquo;re sad and you miss\u2026 them, but you can&rsquo;t stay like this honey\u2026\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move, just keep sitting there, and with that light, you look almost lifeless.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Natalie says, giving up on trying to get something from you. \u201cI&rsquo;ll leave the plate here. If you want something\u2026 Just\u2026 Just let me know.\u201d </p><p>She walks slowly to the door, and, before she closed it she looks at you again. </p><p>You really seems like a ghost. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Tony is sitting on the dinner table looking at the security footage of the cameras in the tower, smiling like a fool at seeing they play monopoly together. </p><p>Tony never thought he was this kind of guy, but he was. Peter and you had made him like that. </p><p>He misses you. The house seems so empty without you, and everyone noticed. A part of the family was missing. A member, and it seemed like they had lost you. \u00a0</p><p>He wants his baby girl back. He want you next to him. That is the only way he could protect you. </p><p>\u201cYou want me to talk to her, boss?\u201d Friday asks him, almost worried. </p><p>\u201cNo, Fri. We can&rsquo;t. Matt said it\u2026 it isn&rsquo;t good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you really going to take her, Tony?\u201d Friday asks, her accent stronger than before.</p><p>\u201cOf course. There&rsquo;s no way I would let her be by herself anymore.\u201d Tony pause the footage on a frame of \u00a0you smiling. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re doing. The worry is keeping him up at night. It was like\u2026 it was like someone had taken his kid. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Tony looks behind him and saw Bucky leaning against the wall with a serious face. \u201cYou have a minute?\u201d </p><p>Tony look away and close the hologram. \u201cSure. What&rsquo;s up?\u201d </p><p>He come closer and sit on the chair beside Tony. A little awkward moment passes between them but they ignored it. It wasn&rsquo;t the time to bring up the past. </p><p>\u201cDo you have new news?\u201d Bucky asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. Just old ones. Her father, Arthur is with his lawyers and they&rsquo;re investigating her home abuse and\u2026 she&rsquo;s with a lady called Natalie\u2026 Matt is coming with the decision about the guard. Now it's\u2026we just wait.\u201d </p><p>Tony hate to wait. It&rsquo;s out of his control and he hate it.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it's\u2026 about that, that I wanted to talk to you.\u201d Bucky begin carefully, directing all Tony\u2019s attention to him. </p><p>\u201cOkay. I&rsquo;m listening.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you noticed Y/ N and I became close. That&rsquo;s because we\u2026 talked. Not\u2026 not exactly. I talked and\u2026 she listened. One night I came here to get a glass of water and she was crying. I came closer and sat besides her. And, for a moment she didn\u2019t look at me, she just keep crying. At some point she stopped and finally looked at me and\u2026 I said \u201cI get it. We\u2019ve all \u00a0been there.\u201d She looked at me, almost challenging me, like she said: \u201cOh yeah? You\u2019ve been through this?\u201d and showed me some black marks on her arms. \u00a0Tony&hellip; I know those marks. It&rsquo;s from a kind of torture with ropes. She&rsquo;s been tortured, Tony. A kid. Our Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Bucky bring his hands to his face and looks back at Tony, who are horrified. </p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t wanted to imagine how Bucky knew this, or how you got those.</p><p>\u201cYou can&rsquo;t let her go back there. She&rsquo;s just a kid. An\u2026 innocent kid. She doesn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI won&rsquo;t.\u201d Tony says with determination. \u201cShe will never go back there.\u201d </p><p>Bucky looks into Tony&rsquo;s eyes and see that he meant it. He wouldn\u2019t let you, and that was enough for him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Bucky says, nodding. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony replies, looking away. </p><p>Bucky stays there just for another minute before he get up and starts to walk away.</p><p>\u201cBarnes?\u201d Tony calls and Bucky turns around. \u201cI&rsquo;m glad she talked to you.\u201d </p><p>Bucky just smiles and nods, walking away right after. </p><p>Yeah, maybe they would heal. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>\u201cBoss? Matt\u2019s here.\u201d Friday says. </p><p>Tony sighs heavily. </p><p>\u201cLet him in.\u201d </p><p>He wait a few minutes in silence with his head bowed low trying to prepare himself for whatever news Matt had. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Matt calls. </p><p>Tony looks up at him. </p><p>\u201cCan I sit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He looks at the hologram again and feel his heart squeeze. </p><p>Matt moves slowly towards him and sit heavily in the chair. </p><p>\u201cSo, Tony. They&rsquo;ve come to a decision.\u201d Matt says with a serious tone. </p><p><i>They&rsquo;ll take her from me, </i>Tony thought </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve allowed her to stay with you \u00a0provisionally. But, since you want to become her legal guardian, a family court will have to meet to appoint you as such. That day isn&rsquo;t confirmed yet, but it should be soon. You can go pick her up now Tony. You can bring Y/N home.\u201d Matt says with a smile. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asks with wide eyes. \u201cThey really\u2026 they\u2019ll let me keep her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, as I said, you\u2019ll have the provisional guardianship, and she\u2019ll have to go to school. You have to proof to them that she can be well treated and have a normal life.\u201d Matt explained. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no problem. I-I can put her in the same school as Peter. He can help her.\u201d He spoke fast, gesturing with his hands. </p><p>\u201cThat would be great. We don\u2019t know exactly how long it will take for them to come to a conclusion.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! Great!\u201d He stand up, smiling broadly \u201cI\u2019ll go pick her up now. The lady knows about -\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Matt interrupts him with a serious face that took Tony smile away. \u201cI have to warn you, that guy, her father, he\u2019s not a good person.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. Tell about it. How could a man who tortures his little girl be a good person.\u201d Tony says with a cold voice. </p><p>\u201cTorture?\u201d Matt raises an eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cBucky told me he saw marks on Hope\u2019s arms, and that he knew what caused those kinds of marks. It\u2019s a kind of torture with ropes&hellip; God, I don&rsquo;t wanna imagine what else this kid suffered.\u201d Tony closes his eyes, trying not to think about his kid crying in pain at Arthur\u2019s hands. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be good for the court proceedings\u201d Matt says as he nodded. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. The man was furious, Tony. He\u2019s\u2026 Dangerous. And his wife isn\u2019t much different. We have to be careful, for y/n sake.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. We will.\u201d Tony says with intensity, and Matt knew that he meant it. </p><p>He leans back in the chair again and smiled. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Go get her.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiles and almost ran out of the room. </p><p>\u201cFriday, if someone asks for me, tell them what happened. Oh! And thank Matt for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it, Boss.\u201d Friday replies with a cheerful voice. </p><p>Tony would finally see you again and be able to protect you. </p><p>How could he ever think of leaving you in the hands of strangers? He couldn\u2019t imagine their lives without you now. Or no monopoly afternoons, or movie nights with Pepper, Peter and you. Life before the arrival of the sweet, quiet girl who arrived at Tony&rsquo;s house weeks ago seemed distant and unreal to him.\u00a0</p><p>He parks out in front of the large house and took a deep breath. It\u2019s big and comfortable. It\u2019s a good place for you but, it isn\u2019t right. </p><p>He stepped out of the car and walks towards the front door. He pauses for a moment, holding his breath, and then knocks on the door. </p><p>Seconds passes before a blond woman with kind eyes opens the door. \u00a0A shocked expression spread across her face. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mrs. Lopez. I\u2019m here to bring Hope home.\u201d Tony says with a kind smile as he saw the woman\u2019s expression change to relief. </p><p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d Natalie says as she brings her hands to her chest. </p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Tony smile rapidly fades away to a \u00a0worried expression. </p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t eat or leave her room, ..\u00a0 she\u2019s so sad\u2026 And I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She says with a guilty expression. </p><p>\u201cTake me to her.\u201d Tony says, entering in the house.</p><p>They walks in silence until they reaches your door\u2019s. Natalie opens it slowly and sighs sadly upon seeing that the food she brought earlier was still there, untouched. She stepped aside to let Tony enter the room..</p><p>\u201cY/n? There\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d </p><p>You suddenly froze. It was Arthur, wasn\u2019t it? He would take you. He would hurt you again. </p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d Tony says lightly as he walks towards you slowly. </p><p>You\u2019re sure it\u2019s your mind tricking you. You\u2019re hallucinating. Mr. Stark wasn&rsquo;t there. The moment you turn around, it was going to be Arthur standing there with <b><i>that</i></b> smile. </p><p><i>I\u2019m fucked. </i></p><p>You turn around and look at him, blinking to make the vision disappear.\u00a0</p><p>But it didn&rsquo;t.\u00a0</p><p>Tony is there looking at you with a worried expression. The relief you felt was so strong that you feel tears coming almost immediately. </p><p>You run to him so fast you stumbled a bit, but Tony knelt down and caught you up in a hug which prevented you from falling</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve got you. I\u2019m here.\u201d Tony keep repeating like a mantra in your ear, and without even realising it, you started to cry. </p><p>\u201cOh, baby girl.\u201d Tony&rsquo;s voice broke, his heart too. He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was fear or your crying causing you to shake, but either way, he could feel how scared you\u2019re. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I promised you, didn\u2019t I? We going home.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>I was so scared. I thought you would leave me. I thought that I never would see you again. I thought I would have to live with him. I thought that I would be alone again. I don&rsquo;t wanna be alone anymore. <b>Please</b>.</i></p><p>You let out a small sob as you tried to breathe properly. </p><p><i>He took the rope with a ghostly smile on his face.</i></p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Tony to realise what was happening; You\u2019re having a panic attack again. The realisation made Tony&rsquo;s heart ache even more. </p><p><i>The ropes tightened around your wrists, making tears form in your eyes.</i></p><p>\u201cHey, hey kid.\u201d Tony tried to push you an arm\u2019s-length away, just enough to look at you, but you hold him right back. </p><p><i>She couldn\u2019t make any noise. She had to stay quiet and tolerate the pain in complete silence. </i></p><p>\u201cY/n, I just want to look at you. Let me look at you kiddo.\u201d Tony asks gently in your ear. </p><p><i>He left the room, leaving her there with her wrists tied and sore. God knows how long she would be there. <b>And it hurts</b></i></p><p>\u201cKid, it\u2019s not real. Whatever you\u2019re reliving it\u2019s not real. You&rsquo;re okay. You\u2019re with me. And you\u2019re safe.\u201d Tony tries to calm you down but you can\u2019t hear him. Or breathe. </p><p>You can\u2019t breathe. All you\u2019re feeling was the tight ropes around you, and it hurt and you <i><b>can\u2019t breathe.</b></i></p><p>Why you can\u2019t breathe? Why did it seem like your lungs are gone? </p><p>\u201cHey, hey. No. Stay with me. You\u2019re not going to pass out on me. Breathe with me kiddo, come on. You can do it.\u201d Tony takes a few deep exaggerated breaths for you copy.</p><p><i>Pass out?</i></p><p>Just then you realise you\u2019re seeing black dots in the corners of your vision and your head seemed heavy, and you still can\u2019t breathe. </p><p>\u201cY/n. Focus on me.\u201d Tony spoke urgently and takes your face in his hands. You try to focus on his worried expression in front of you, but it was getting fuzzy around the edges. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBreathe, kiddo. Slowly. It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s okay now. I promise.\u201d </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t working. Tony&rsquo;s concern and the ache on his heart was only growing. </p><p>\u201cI know you wanna go home kid, so help me, okay? You&rsquo;ve got to breathe. They probably won\u2019t let me carry you out of here unconscious.\u201d he tried to joke.<i> Like they could stop me if I had to. </i></p><p><i>Home. </i></p><p>You\u2019re going home. </p><p>You finally found his gaze, seeing how desperate he looked. </p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d Tony said again and let out an exaggerated breath for you to copy.</p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>\u201cWe gonna play Monopoly again.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Out.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat movie do you wanna watch? I know Peter made you addicted to Star Wars too.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much everybody misses you.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Out.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right kiddo. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d<br/></p><p><i>Do it again.</i></p><p>Tony let out a sigh of relief when he sees you breathing normally, looking at youi with kind eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou scared me there for a second.\u201d He tried to joke again, taking a deep breath. </p><p>You look at him, still holding him tightly.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou okay? Ready to go home?\u201d He asks brushing your hair away from your face. </p><p>You nods, feeling the exhaustion starting to get to you. </p><p>He get up holding your hand and helps you to stay on your feet. He quickly thanked Natalie, holding you by your shoulders and led you out of the house. </p><p>Tony helps you get in the car and walks around to the driver side. He fastened his seat belt while watching you closely. You looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>You nods and leans your head against the window of the car, too tired to open your eyes. Your body shivered as a chill ran up your spine.</p><p>Tony noticed the shiver and reached for the temperature dial on the dashboard. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d He asks, narrowing his eyes. </p><p>You nodded again. </p><p>Tony took off his jacket and spread it over you like a blanket. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>You give a small nod, almost asleep.</p><p>The relief that Tony felt no long ago, was replaced with worry as he started to drive home. The whole way to the Tower he was taking worried glances at you. You shivered from time to time and looked too pale for Tony\u2019s liking. </p><p>He parked the car in the Tower&rsquo;s underground garage and looks over at you.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d He called softly. \u201cKid, wake up. We\u2019re here.\u201d He touches your shoulder lightly, but you just made a noise and turns your face further into the door of the car. . </p><p>Tony signs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have to carry you after all.\u201d </p><p>He opens his door, got out, and walks to your side. He opens the door slowly, with his hand read to catch your head which had been leaning on the window. He looped one arm around your shoulders, the other under your knees, and lifted you out of the car. Tony kicked the door shut with his heel and gripped you more securely as you shifts in his arms. </p><p>\u201cWell, I definitely can feel my age now, huh?\u201d He mutters to himself, as he walks to the door and stepped into the elevator. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, boss. Where would you like me to take you?\u201d Friday asks. </p><p>\u201cY/n\u2019s room, Fri. Quickly.\u201d He says, looking down at you. </p><p>\u201cMr. Rogers requires your presence in the living room, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Friday.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The elevator ascended quickly, and soon you two are in your room. </p><p>He lays you on the bed and carefully covers you with warm blankets, looking at you for a moment. </p><p><i>She&rsquo;s home. Finally. </i>Tony thought. <i>Everything would be fine now. </i></p><p>But that thought didn\u2019t stay for long. </p><p>You shiver on your blanked, and Tony\u2019s concern grew. </p><p>He sit on your bed and gently places his palm in your forehead, feeling the warmth and the sweat forming on your forehead. </p><p>\u201cShit. Friday, what&rsquo;s Y/n\u2019s temperature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/n\u2019s temperature it\u2019s currely of 103.5\u201d </p><p><i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. </i></p><p>\u201cFriday, call Bruce, tell him to get here. Now.\u201d Tony says, throwing another blanket over you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. You\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d Tony sit on your bed and watchs you. Your hair was sticking to your pale forehead and you breathing sounds raspy. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Tony hears Bruce at the door. \u201cTony, what&rsquo;s wrong?\u201d </p><p>Tony looks over at Bruce with concerned eyes. </p><p>\u201cY/n. She\u2026 She\u2019s sick. Fever of 103,5.\u201d </p><p>Bruce came closer and looks at you, his professional side kicking in. </p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don't\u2026 I don&rsquo;t know. The lady who was with her said that she wasn\u2019t eating or leaving her room or\u2026 Bruce do something.\u201d Tony asks, worry evident in his voice. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Tony. You need to calm down. I think she\u2019s only dehydrated.\u201d Bruce says. \u00a0He hold your wrist to take your pulse and waited a few seconds. \u201cShe\u2019s kinda fast and thready. I think it\u2019s best if we put her on an IV and give her fluids. I don\u2019t know how long she went without eating or drinking anything. Let\u2019s take her to the medlab.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods and picks you up in the arms again. Bruce helped with the blankets, and they walked towards the medlab. </p><p>Tony placed you on the hospital bed and stepped back to let Bruce work. Tony sits in the chair next to the bed and watched Bruce hang up bags of fluid. He winced when Bruce slid the IV needle into the top of your hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting normal saline, D5W, and RL She should be fine.\u201d Bruce says while taping the IV in place. . </p><p>\u201cEnglish, Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaline, sugar, and salts. She\u2019ll be fine Tony.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Tony let out a deep breath and nods. </p><p>\u201cThe team is waiting in the living room, Tony. They wanna know what&rsquo;s happened.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks at Hope and then to Bruce. </p><p>\u201cFriday, let me know if anything changes with her, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d Friday said and he get up, still looking at you. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Bruce.\u201d </p><p>They walked together in silence until they entered the living room and questions erupted from the team.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Loki stood up and asked. </p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Bucky asked. </p><p>\u201cAre they gonna let us keep her?\u201d Peter questioned. </p><p>\u201cHow is she Tony?\u201d Pepper came close and took his hands. </p><p>\u201cLet him speak guys.\u201d Steve got up and raised his hand up to call for silence. The team settled. \u00a0Steve crossed his arms. \u201cHow is she Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s home.\u201d Tony let out a deep breath. \u201cShe&rsquo;s fine, just a little sick and dehydrated, nothing big. They\u2019ll let us keep her long enough to investigate her father and she\u2019ll have to go to school and try to have a normal life with us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll support you.\u201d Wanda said without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to help you and her.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe&rsquo;s right.

Of course we\u2019re gonna help.\u201d Clint said with soft eyes and a smile. </p><p>Tony looked at each one of them and smiled, finally feeling what he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. </p><p>Supported. </p><p>\u201cThanks guys.

Friday hadn\u2019t spoken to you since, but the watch are still working. If it wasn\u2019t for that, you could swear it was all just a dream. You would swear you never had a family again. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The truth is, you\u2019re starting to doubt, and it sucks because maybe the feelings they had for you was just pity. Maybe they never saw you as you saw them. Maybe you just made yourself a fool again, maybe you was nothing but the homeless and starving girl Loki found. You couldn\u2019t help but start to feel tears coming. </p><p>The pain is so strong and you missed them so much, it seemed it would kill you. \u00a0All you wanted was to go back and play Monopoly and have movie nights with them. Hear Peter talk about Star Wars and spend almost all night with Mr. Stark in the lab, hearing him murmur a song that Friday was playing, too concentrated on what he was doing to notice you hiding a smile. Or even stay up reading with Pepper or see Loki\u2019s magic and learn self-defence with Buck. </p><p><i>Bucky</i>. </p><p>You touches the bracelet he gave you, feeling a tear fall. </p><p><i>This will protect me. </i></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d you hear Natalie, the woman you\u2019re staying with, knock on the door. \u201cI brought you lunch.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move from the window you\u2019re sitting in, just looking at the heavy clouds of the storm that was about to come.</p><p>Natalie peeks in with her head and looks at the sad girl watching the rain. She enters, biting her lip and put the tray on the table and walked towards you. </p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cI made chicken\u2026\u201d still no response. \u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? You didn\u2019t eat anything since yesterday\u2026 you\u2019ll end up sick.\u201d </p><p>She sit next to you looking for the your eyes. \u201cOr maybe get out of this room? You\u2019ve just stayed \u00a0here since you arrived\u2026 Earth to Hope\u2026are you in there?\u201d She waves her hand lightly in front of your face. Nothing. She shifts in the same spot, still biting her lips. \u201cLook\u2026 I know you\u2019re sad and you miss\u2026 them, but you can\u2019t stay like this honey\u2026\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move, just keep sitting there, and with that light, you look almost lifeless.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Natalie says, giving up on trying to get something from you. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the plate here. If you want something\u2026 Just\u2026 Just let me know.\u201d </p><p>She walks slowly to the door, and, before she closed it she looks at you again. </p><p>You really seems like a ghost. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Tony is sitting on the dinner table looking at the security footage of the cameras in the tower, smiling like a fool at seeing they play monopoly together. </p><p>Tony never thought he was this kind of guy, but he was. Peter and you had made him like that. </p><p>He misses you. The house seems so empty without you, and everyone noticed. A part of the family was missing. A member, and it seemed like they had lost you. \u00a0</p><p>He wants his baby girl back. He want you next to him. That is the only way he could protect you. </p><p>\u201cYou want me to talk to her, boss?\u201d Friday asks him, almost worried. </p><p>\u201cNo, Fri. We can\u2019t. Matt said it\u2026 it isn\u2019t good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you really going to take her, Tony?\u201d Friday asks, her accent stronger than before.</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s no way I would let her be by herself anymore.\u201d Tony pause the footage on a frame of \u00a0you smiling. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re doing. The worry is keeping him up at night. It was like\u2026 it was like someone had taken his kid. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Tony looks behind him and saw Bucky leaning against the wall with a serious face. \u201cYou have a minute?\u201d </p><p>Tony look away and close the hologram. \u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>He come closer and sit on the chair beside Tony. A little awkward moment passes between them but they ignored it. It wasn\u2019t the time to bring up the past. </p><p>\u201cDo you have new news?\u201d Bucky asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. Just old ones. Her father, Arthur is with his lawyers and they\u2019re investigating her home abuse and\u2026 she\u2019s with a lady called Natalie\u2026 Matt is coming with the decision about the guard. Now it's\u2026we just wait.\u201d </p><p>Tony hate to wait. It\u2019s out of his control and he hate it.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it's\u2026 about that, that I wanted to talk to you.\u201d Bucky begin carefully, directing all Tony\u2019s attention to him. </p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m listening.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you noticed Y/ N and I became close. That\u2019s because we\u2026 talked. Not\u2026 not exactly. I talked and\u2026 she listened. One night I came here to get a glass of water and she was crying. I came closer and sat besides her. And, for a moment she didn\u2019t look at me, she just keep crying. At some point she stopped and finally looked at me and\u2026 I said \u201cI get it. We\u2019ve all \u00a0been there.\u201d She looked at me, almost challenging me, like she said: \u201cOh yeah? You\u2019ve been through this?\u201d and showed me some black marks on her arms. \u00a0Tony\u2026 I know those marks. It\u2019s from a kind of torture with ropes. She\u2019s been tortured, Tony. A kid. Our Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Bucky bring his hands to his face and looks back at Tony, who are horrified. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t wanted to imagine how Bucky knew this, or how you got those.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let her go back there. She\u2019s just a kid. An\u2026 innocent kid. She doesn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Tony says with determination. \u201cShe will never go back there.\u201d </p><p>Bucky looks into Tony\u2019s eyes and see that he meant it. He wouldn\u2019t let you, and that was enough for him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Bucky says, nodding. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony replies, looking away. </p><p>Bucky stays there just for another minute before he get up and starts to walk away.</p><p>\u201cBarnes?\u201d Tony calls and Bucky turns around. \u201cI\u2019m glad she talked to you.\u201d </p><p>Bucky just smiles and nods, walking away right after. </p><p>Yeah, maybe they would heal. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cBoss? Matt\u2019s here.\u201d Friday says. </p><p>Tony sighs heavily. </p><p>\u201cLet him in.\u201d </p><p>He wait a few minutes in silence with his head bowed low trying to prepare himself for whatever news Matt had. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Matt calls. </p><p>Tony looks up at him. </p><p>\u201cCan I sit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He looks at the hologram again and feel his heart squeeze. </p><p>Matt moves slowly towards him and sit heavily in the chair. </p><p>\u201cSo, Tony. They\u2019ve come to a decision.\u201d Matt says with a serious tone. </p><p><i>They\u2019ll take her from me, </i>Tony thought </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve allowed her to stay with you \u00a0provisionally. But, since you want to become her legal guardian, a family court will have to meet to appoint you as such. That day isn\u2019t confirmed yet, but it should be soon. You can go pick her up now Tony. You can bring Y/N home.\u201d Matt says with a smile. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asks with wide eyes. \u201cThey really\u2026 they\u2019ll let me keep her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, as I said, you\u2019ll have the provisional guardianship, and she\u2019ll have to go to school. You have to proof to them that she can be well treated and have a normal life.\u201d Matt explained. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no problem. I-I can put her in the same school as Peter. He can help her.\u201d He spoke fast, gesturing with his hands. </p><p>\u201cThat would be great. We don\u2019t know exactly how long it will take for them to come to a conclusion.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! Great!\u201d He stand up, smiling broadly \u201cI\u2019ll go pick her up now. The lady knows about -\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Matt interrupts him with a serious face that took Tony smile away. \u201cI have to warn you, that guy, her father, he\u2019s not a good person.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. Tell about it. How could a man who tortures his little girl be a good person.\u201d Tony says with a cold voice. </p><p>\u201cTorture?\u201d Matt raises an eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cBucky told me he saw marks on Hope\u2019s arms, and that he knew what caused those kinds of marks. It\u2019s a kind of torture with ropes\u2026 God, I don\u2019t wanna imagine what else this kid suffered.\u201d Tony closes his eyes, trying not to think about his kid crying in pain at Arthur\u2019s hands. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be good for the court proceedings\u201d Matt says as he nodded. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. The man was furious, Tony. He\u2019s\u2026 Dangerous. And his wife isn\u2019t much different. We have to be careful, for y/n sake.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. We will.\u201d Tony says with intensity, and Matt knew that he meant it. </p><p>He leans back in the chair again and smiled. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Go get her.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiles and almost ran out of the room. </p><p>\u201cFriday, if someone asks for me, tell them what happened. Oh! And thank Matt for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it, Boss.\u201d Friday replies with a cheerful voice. </p><p>Tony would finally see you again and be able to protect you. </p><p>How could he ever think of leaving you in the hands of strangers? He couldn\u2019t imagine their lives without you now. Or no monopoly afternoons, or movie nights with Pepper, Peter and you. Life before the arrival of the sweet, quiet girl who arrived at Tony\u2019s house weeks ago seemed distant and unreal to him.\u00a0</p><p>He parks out in front of the large house and took a deep breath. It\u2019s big and comfortable. It\u2019s a good place for you but, it isn\u2019t right. </p><p>He stepped out of the car and walks towards the front door. He pauses for a moment, holding his breath, and then knocks on the door. </p><p>Seconds passes before a blond woman with kind eyes opens the door. \u00a0A shocked expression spread across her face. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mrs. Lopez. I\u2019m here to bring Hope home.\u201d Tony says with a kind smile as he saw the woman\u2019s expression change to relief. </p><p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d Natalie says as she brings her hands to her chest. </p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Tony smile rapidly fades away to a \u00a0worried expression. </p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t eat or leave her room, ..\u00a0 she\u2019s so sad\u2026 And I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She says with a guilty expression. </p><p>\u201cTake me to her.\u201d Tony says, entering in the house.</p><p>They walks in silence until they reaches your door\u2019s. Natalie opens it slowly and sighs sadly upon seeing that the food she brought earlier was still there, untouched. She stepped aside to let Tony enter the room..</p><p>\u201cY/n? There\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d </p><p>You suddenly froze. It was Arthur, wasn\u2019t it? He would take you. He would hurt you again. </p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d Tony says lightly as he walks towards you slowly. </p><p>You\u2019re sure it\u2019s your mind tricking you. You\u2019re hallucinating. Mr. Stark wasn\u2019t there. The moment you turn around, it was going to be Arthur standing there with <b><i>that</i></b> smile. </p><p><i>I\u2019m fucked. </i></p><p>You turn around and look at him, blinking to make the vision disappear.\u00a0</p><p>But it didn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>Tony is there looking at you with a worried expression. The relief you felt was so strong that you feel tears coming almost immediately. </p><p>You run to him so fast you stumbled a bit, but Tony knelt down and caught you up in a hug which prevented you from falling</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve got you. I\u2019m here.\u201d Tony keep repeating like a mantra in your ear, and without even realising it, you started to cry. </p><p>\u201cOh, baby girl.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice broke, his heart too. He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was fear or your crying causing you to shake, but either way, he could feel how scared you\u2019re. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I promised you, didn\u2019t I? We going home.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>I was so scared. I thought you would leave me. I thought that I never would see you again. I thought I would have to live with him. I thought that I would be alone again. I don\u2019t wanna be alone anymore. <b>Please</b>.</i></p><p>You let out a small sob as you tried to breathe properly. </p><p><i>He took the rope with a ghostly smile on his face.</i></p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Tony to realise what was happening; You\u2019re having a panic attack again. The realisation made Tony\u2019s heart ache even more. </p><p><i>The ropes tightened around your wrists, making tears form in your eyes.</i></p><p>\u201cHey, hey kid.\u201d Tony tried to push you an arm\u2019s-length away, just enough to look at you, but you hold him right back. </p><p><i>She couldn\u2019t make any noise. She had to stay quiet and tolerate the pain in complete silence. </i></p><p>\u201cY/n, I just want to look at you. Let me look at you kiddo.\u201d Tony asks gently in your ear. </p><p><i>He left the room, leaving her there with her wrists tied and sore. God knows how long she would be there. <b>And it hurts</b></i></p><p>\u201cKid, it\u2019s not real. Whatever you\u2019re reliving it\u2019s not real. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re with me. And you\u2019re safe.\u201d Tony tries to calm you down but you can\u2019t hear him. Or breathe. </p><p>You can\u2019t breathe. All you\u2019re feeling was the tight ropes around you, and it hurt and you <i><b>can\u2019t breathe.</b></i></p><p>Why you can\u2019t breathe? Why did it seem like your lungs are gone? </p><p>\u201cHey, hey. No. Stay with me. You\u2019re not going to pass out on me. Breathe with me kiddo, come on. You can do it.\u201d Tony takes a few deep exaggerated breaths for you copy.</p><p><i>Pass out?</i></p><p>Just then you realise you\u2019re seeing black dots in the corners of your vision and your head seemed heavy, and you still can\u2019t breathe. </p><p>\u201cY/n. Focus on me.\u201d Tony spoke urgently and takes your face in his hands. You try to focus on his worried expression in front of you, but it was getting fuzzy around the edges. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBreathe, kiddo. Slowly. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay now. I promise.\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t working. Tony\u2019s concern and the ache on his heart was only growing. </p><p>\u201cI know you wanna go home kid, so help me, okay? You\u2019ve got to breathe. They probably won\u2019t let me carry you out of here unconscious.\u201d he tried to joke.<i> Like they could stop me if I had to. </i></p><p><i>Home. </i></p><p>You\u2019re going home. </p><p>You finally found his gaze, seeing how desperate he looked. </p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d Tony said again and let out an exaggerated breath for you to copy.</p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>\u201cWe gonna play Monopoly again.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Out.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat movie do you wanna watch? I know Peter made you addicted to Star Wars too.\u201d<br></p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much everybody misses you.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Out.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right kiddo. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Do it again.</i></p><p>Tony let out a sigh of relief when he sees you breathing normally, looking at youi with kind eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou scared me there for a second.\u201d He tried to joke again, taking a deep breath. </p><p>You look at him, still holding him tightly.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou okay? Ready to go home?\u201d He asks brushing your hair away from your face. </p><p>You nods, feeling the exhaustion starting to get to you. </p><p>He get up holding your hand and helps you to stay on your feet. He quickly thanked Natalie, holding you by your shoulders and led you out of the house. </p><p>Tony helps you get in the car and walks around to the driver side. He fastened his seat belt while watching you closely. You looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>You nods and leans your head against the window of the car, too tired to open your eyes. Your body shivered as a chill ran up your spine.</p><p>Tony noticed the shiver and reached for the temperature dial on the dashboard. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d He asks, narrowing his eyes. </p><p>You nodded again. </p><p>Tony took off his jacket and spread it over you like a blanket. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>You give a small nod, almost asleep.</p><p>The relief that Tony felt no long ago, was replaced with worry as he started to drive home. The whole way to the Tower he was taking worried glances at you. You shivered from time to time and looked too pale for Tony\u2019s liking. </p><p>He parked the car in the Tower\u2019s underground garage and looks over at you.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d He called softly. \u201cKid, wake up. We\u2019re here.\u201d He touches your shoulder lightly, but you just made a noise and turns your face further into the door of the car. . </p><p>Tony signs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have to carry you after all.\u201d </p><p>He opens his door, got out, and walks to your side. He opens the door slowly, with his hand read to catch your head which had been leaning on the window. He looped one arm around your shoulders, the other under your knees, and lifted you out of the car. Tony kicked the door shut with his heel and gripped you more securely as you shifts in his arms. </p><p>\u201cWell, I definitely can feel my age now, huh?\u201d He mutters to himself, as he walks to the door and stepped into the elevator. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, boss. Where would you like me to take you?\u201d Friday asks. </p><p>\u201cY/n\u2019s room, Fri. Quickly.\u201d He says, looking down at you. </p><p>\u201cMr. Rogers requires your presence in the living room, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Friday.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The elevator ascended quickly, and soon you two are in your room. </p><p>He lays you on the bed and carefully covers you with warm blankets, looking at you for a moment. </p><p><i>She\u2019s home. Finally. </i>Tony thought. <i>Everything would be fine now. </i></p><p>But that thought didn\u2019t stay for long. </p><p>You shiver on your blanked, and Tony\u2019s concern grew. </p><p>He sit on your bed and gently places his palm in your forehead, feeling the warmth and the sweat forming on your forehead. </p><p>\u201cShit. Friday, what\u2019s Y/n\u2019s temperature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/n\u2019s temperature it\u2019s currely of 103.5\u201d </p><p><i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. </i></p><p>\u201cFriday, call Bruce, tell him to get here. Now.\u201d Tony says, throwing another blanket over you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. You\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d Tony sit on your bed and watchs you. Your hair was sticking to your pale forehead and you breathing sounds raspy. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Tony hears Bruce at the door. \u201cTony, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p>Tony looks over at Bruce with concerned eyes. </p><p>\u201cY/n. She\u2026 She\u2019s sick. Fever of 103,5.\u201d </p><p>Bruce came closer and looks at you, his professional side kicking in. </p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don't\u2026 I don\u2019t know. The lady who was with her said that she wasn\u2019t eating or leaving her room or\u2026 Bruce do something.\u201d Tony asks, worry evident in his voice. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Tony. You need to calm down. I think she\u2019s only dehydrated.\u201d Bruce says. \u00a0He hold your wrist to take your pulse and waited a few seconds. \u201cShe\u2019s kinda fast and thready. I think it\u2019s best if we put her on an IV and give her fluids. I don\u2019t know how long she went without eating or drinking anything. Let\u2019s take her to the medlab.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods and picks you up in the arms again. Bruce helped with the blankets, and they walked towards the medlab. </p><p>Tony placed you on the hospital bed and stepped back to let Bruce work. Tony sits in the chair next to the bed and watched Bruce hang up bags of fluid. He winced when Bruce slid the IV needle into the top of your hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting normal saline, D5W, and RL She should be fine.\u201d Bruce says while taping the IV in place. . </p><p>\u201cEnglish, Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaline, sugar, and salts. She\u2019ll be fine Tony.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Tony let out a deep breath and nods. </p><p>\u201cThe team is waiting in the living room, Tony. They wanna know what\u2019s happened.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks at Hope and then to Bruce. </p><p>\u201cFriday, let me know if anything changes with her, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d Friday said and he get up, still looking at you. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Bruce.\u201d </p><p>They walked together in silence until they entered the living room and questions erupted from the team.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Loki stood up and asked. </p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Bucky asked. </p><p>\u201cAre they gonna let us keep her?\u201d Peter questioned. </p><p>\u201cHow is she Tony?\u201d Pepper came close and took his hands. </p><p>\u201cLet him speak guys.\u201d Steve got up and raised his hand up to call for silence. The team settled. \u00a0Steve crossed his arms. \u201cHow is she Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home.\u201d Tony let out a deep breath. \u201cShe\u2019s fine, just a little sick and dehydrated, nothing big. They\u2019ll let us keep her long enough to investigate her father and she\u2019ll have to go to school and try to have a normal life with us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll support you.\u201d Wanda said without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to help you and her.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. We\u2019re a team and we\u2019ll work through this together.\u201d Nat said looking confidently at him.</p><p>\u201cY/n is a good kid. Of course we\u2019re gonna help.\u201d Clint said with soft eyes and a smile. </p><p>Tony looked at each one of them and smiled, finally feeling what he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. </p><p>Supported. </p><p>\u201cThanks guys. I\u2026 I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><hr><p><b></b></p><p><b><i>Taglist:</i></b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxElgVUCBv21LOz1Kb5sMEQ\">@dont-stop-keep-walking</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qNE2JLH-h1qeBF-eTiOUQ\">@keep-a-bucket-full-of-stars</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjT2EnG8Ya4ZmnPnCCRAJfA\">@otomelady</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m917bKjNzPuWxDb8zReLIFQ\">@benispernice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m70S0Pr9mIKE1JULRDYVsZQ\">@what-inspirational-name</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkfGQCp4-aEC5ZdGkQLlVqA\">@pachuh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRayZDnYZaWR33NudZQXLw\">@purplekitten30</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn4HJ3fXqX3D7gNKtzFl0bw\">@sparkling-gayyy</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxR_6HAcrtkOsxsz87epgYA\">@fandom-fangirl07</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG3Wm4cH2k1Jr367ZDIOsCA\">@thefantomfandom</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgN7BD0OGUwSZ3x2Vxly24w\">@just4muggles</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3r6Xl--XL7buPUrl8_JOtA\">@digicharr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGI4ovLFmM3SDswNByjmS_w\">@pietrorunsforme</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miI11MWeMTXQTQu-i5CjGsQ\">@annacarolinafeelings</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzSzz4YNXIES8EeXpImJUQ\">@emygirl</a> </p>",

It had been five days, and Mr. Stark hadn\u2019t spoken to you since then. Part of you knew he couldn\u2019t, the lawyer you forgot the name of told you that you couldn\u2019t speak with Mr. Stark for a while because that could \u201cinterfere in the proceedings\u201d.<br></p><p>But most of all, you\u2019re scared. What if Mr. Stark didn\u2019t want you and you would have to live with Arthur and Elizabeth again? You wouldn\u2019t even get in the front door before they would you for escaping and ending up living with <b><i>the avengers </i></b>of all people. </p><p>You sighs and looks at your watch. Friday hadn\u2019t spoken to you since, but the watch are still working. If it wasn\u2019t for that, you could swear it was all just a dream. You would swear you never had a family again. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The truth is, you\u2019re starting to doubt, and it sucks because maybe the feelings they had for you was just pity. Maybe they never saw you as you saw them. Maybe you just made yourself a fool again, maybe you was nothing but the homeless and starving girl Loki found. You couldn\u2019t help but start to feel tears coming. </p><p>The pain is so strong and you missed them so much, it seemed it would kill you. \u00a0All you wanted was to go back and play Monopoly and have movie nights with them. Hear Peter talk about Star Wars and spend almost all night with Mr. Stark in the lab, hearing him murmur a song that Friday was playing, too concentrated on what he was doing to notice you hiding a smile. Or even stay up reading with Pepper or see Loki\u2019s magic and learn self-defence with Buck. </p><p><i>Bucky</i>. </p><p>You touches the bracelet he gave you, feeling a tear fall. </p><p><i>This will protect me. </i></p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d you hear Natalie, the woman you\u2019re staying with, knock on the door. \u201cI brought you lunch.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move from the window you\u2019re sitting in, just looking at the heavy clouds of the storm that was about to come.</p><p>Natalie peeks in with her head and looks at the sad girl watching the rain. She enters, biting her lip and put the tray on the table and walked towards you. </p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cI made chicken\u2026\u201d still no response. \u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? You didn\u2019t eat anything since yesterday\u2026 you\u2019ll end up sick.\u201d </p><p>She sit next to you looking for the your eyes. \u201cOr maybe get out of this room? You\u2019ve just stayed \u00a0here since you arrived\u2026 Earth to Hope\u2026are you in there?\u201d She waves her hand lightly in front of your face. Nothing. She shifts in the same spot, still biting her lips. \u201cLook\u2026 I know you\u2019re sad and you miss\u2026 them, but you can\u2019t stay like this honey\u2026\u201d </p><p>You don\u2019t move, just keep sitting there, and with that light, you look almost lifeless.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Natalie says, giving up on trying to get something from you. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the plate here. If you want something\u2026 Just\u2026 Just let me know.\u201d </p><p>She walks slowly to the door, and, before she closed it she looks at you again. </p><p>You really seems like a ghost. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>Tony is sitting on the dinner table looking at the security footage of the cameras in the tower, smiling like a fool at seeing they play monopoly together. </p><p>Tony never thought he was this kind of guy, but he was. Peter and you had made him like that. </p><p>He misses you. The house seems so empty without you, and everyone noticed. A part of the family was missing. A member, and it seemed like they had lost you. \u00a0</p><p>He wants his baby girl back. He want you next to him. That is the only way he could protect you. </p><p>\u201cYou want me to talk to her, boss?\u201d Friday asks him, almost worried. </p><p>\u201cNo, Fri. We can\u2019t. Matt said it\u2026 it isn\u2019t good.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you really going to take her, Tony?\u201d Friday asks, her accent stronger than before.</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s no way I would let her be by herself anymore.\u201d Tony pause the footage on a frame of \u00a0you smiling. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re doing. The worry is keeping him up at night. It was like\u2026 it was like someone had taken his kid. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Tony looks behind him and saw Bucky leaning against the wall with a serious face. \u201cYou have a minute?\u201d </p><p>Tony look away and close the hologram. \u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>He come closer and sit on the chair beside Tony. A little awkward moment passes between them but they ignored it. It wasn\u2019t the time to bring up the past. </p><p>\u201cDo you have new news?\u201d Bucky asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. Just old ones. Her father, Arthur is with his lawyers and they\u2019re investigating her home abuse and\u2026 she\u2019s with a lady called Natalie\u2026 Matt is coming with the decision about the guard. Now it's\u2026we just wait.\u201d </p><p>Tony hate to wait. It\u2019s out of his control and he hate it.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it's\u2026 about that, that I wanted to talk to you.\u201d Bucky begin carefully, directing all Tony\u2019s attention to him. </p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m listening.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you noticed Y/ N and I became close. That\u2019s because we\u2026 talked. Not\u2026 not exactly. I talked and\u2026 she listened. One night I came here to get a glass of water and she was crying. I came closer and sat besides her. And, for a moment she didn\u2019t look at me, she just keep crying. At some point she stopped and finally looked at me and\u2026 I said \u201cI get it. We\u2019ve all \u00a0been there.\u201d She looked at me, almost challenging me, like she said: \u201cOh yeah? You\u2019ve been through this?\u201d and showed me some black marks on her arms. \u00a0Tony\u2026 I know those marks. It\u2019s from a kind of torture with ropes. She\u2019s been tortured, Tony. A kid. Our Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Bucky bring his hands to his face and looks back at Tony, who are horrified. </p><p>Tony didn\u2019t wanted to imagine how Bucky knew this, or how you got those.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let her go back there. She\u2019s just a kid. An\u2026 innocent kid. She doesn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Tony says with determination. \u201cShe will never go back there.\u201d </p><p>Bucky looks into Tony\u2019s eyes and see that he meant it. He wouldn\u2019t let you, and that was enough for him.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Bucky says, nodding. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony replies, looking away. </p><p>Bucky stays there just for another minute before he get up and starts to walk away.</p><p>\u201cBarnes?\u201d Tony calls and Bucky turns around. \u201cI\u2019m glad she talked to you.\u201d </p><p>Bucky just smiles and nods, walking away right after. </p><p>Yeah, maybe they would heal. </p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cBoss? Matt\u2019s here.\u201d Friday says. </p><p>Tony sighs heavily. </p><p>\u201cLet him in.\u201d </p><p>He wait a few minutes in silence with his head bowed low trying to prepare himself for whatever news Matt had. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Matt calls. </p><p>Tony looks up at him. </p><p>\u201cCan I sit?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He looks at the hologram again and feel his heart squeeze. </p><p>Matt moves slowly towards him and sit heavily in the chair. </p><p>\u201cSo, Tony. They\u2019ve come to a decision.\u201d Matt says with a serious tone. </p><p><i>They\u2019ll take her from me, </i>Tony thought </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve allowed her to stay with you \u00a0provisionally. But, since you want to become her legal guardian, a family court will have to meet to appoint you as such. That day isn\u2019t confirmed yet, but it should be soon. You can go pick her up now Tony. You can bring Y/N home.\u201d Matt says with a smile. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asks with wide eyes. \u201cThey really\u2026 they\u2019ll let me keep her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, as I said, you\u2019ll have the provisional guardianship, and she\u2019ll have to go to school. You have to proof to them that she can be well treated and have a normal life.\u201d Matt explained. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no problem. I-I can put her in the same school as Peter. He can help her.\u201d He spoke fast, gesturing with his hands. </p><p>\u201cThat would be great. We don\u2019t know exactly how long it will take for them to come to a conclusion.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! Great!\u201d He stand up, smiling broadly \u201cI\u2019ll go pick her up now. The lady knows about -\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Matt interrupts him with a serious face that took Tony smile away. \u201cI have to warn you, that guy, her father, he\u2019s not a good person.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. Tell about it. How could a man who tortures his little girl be a good person.\u201d Tony says with a cold voice. </p><p>\u201cTorture?\u201d Matt raises an eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cBucky told me he saw marks on Hope\u2019s arms, and that he knew what caused those kinds of marks. It\u2019s a kind of torture with ropes\u2026 God, I don\u2019t wanna imagine what else this kid suffered.\u201d Tony closes his eyes, trying not to think about his kid crying in pain at Arthur\u2019s hands. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be good for the court proceedings\u201d Matt says as he nodded. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. The man was furious, Tony. He\u2019s\u2026 Dangerous. And his wife isn\u2019t much different. We have to be careful, for y/n sake.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. We will.\u201d Tony says with intensity, and Matt knew that he meant it. </p><p>He leans back in the chair again and smiled. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Go get her.\u201d </p><p>Tony smiles and almost ran out of the room. </p><p>\u201cFriday, if someone asks for me, tell them what happened. Oh! And thank Matt for me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGot it, Boss.\u201d Friday replies with a cheerful voice. </p><p>Tony would finally see you again and be able to protect you. </p><p>How could he ever think of leaving you in the hands of strangers? He couldn\u2019t imagine their lives without you now. Or no monopoly afternoons, or movie nights with Pepper, Peter and you. Life before the arrival of the sweet, quiet girl who arrived at Tony\u2019s house weeks ago seemed distant and unreal to him.\u00a0</p><p>He parks out in front of the large house and took a deep breath. It\u2019s big and comfortable. It\u2019s a good place for you but, it isn\u2019t right. </p><p>He stepped out of the car and walks towards the front door. He pauses for a moment, holding his breath, and then knocks on the door. </p><p>Seconds passes before a blond woman with kind eyes opens the door. \u00a0A shocked expression spread across her face. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mrs. Lopez. I\u2019m here to bring Hope home.\u201d Tony says with a kind smile as he saw the woman\u2019s expression change to relief. </p><p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d Natalie says as she brings her hands to her chest. </p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Tony smile rapidly fades away to a \u00a0worried expression. </p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t eat or leave her room, ..\u00a0 she\u2019s so sad\u2026 And I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She says with a guilty expression. </p><p>\u201cTake me to her.\u201d Tony says, entering in the house.</p><p>They walks in silence until they reaches your door\u2019s. Natalie opens it slowly and sighs sadly upon seeing that the food she brought earlier was still there, untouched. She stepped aside to let Tony enter the room..</p><p>\u201cY/n? There\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201d </p><p>You suddenly froze. It was Arthur, wasn\u2019t it? He would take you. He would hurt you again. </p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d Tony says lightly as he walks towards you slowly. </p><p>You\u2019re sure it\u2019s your mind tricking you. You\u2019re hallucinating. Mr. Stark wasn\u2019t there. The moment you turn around, it was going to be Arthur standing there with <b><i>that</i></b> smile. </p><p><i>I\u2019m fucked. </i></p><p>You turn around and look at him, blinking to make the vision disappear.\u00a0</p><p>But it didn\u2019t.\u00a0</p><p>Tony is there looking at you with a worried expression. The relief you felt was so strong that you feel tears coming almost immediately. </p><p>You run to him so fast you stumbled a bit, but Tony knelt down and caught you up in a hug which prevented you from falling</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve got you. I\u2019m here.\u201d Tony keep repeating like a mantra in your ear, and without even realising it, you started to cry. </p><p>\u201cOh, baby girl.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice broke, his heart too. He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was fear or your crying causing you to shake, but either way, he could feel how scared you\u2019re. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I promised you, didn\u2019t I? We going home.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>I was so scared. I thought you would leave me. I thought that I never would see you again. I thought I would have to live with him. I thought that I would be alone again. I don\u2019t wanna be alone anymore. <b>Please</b>.</i></p><p>You let out a small sob as you tried to breathe properly. </p><p><i>He took the rope with a ghostly smile on his face.</i></p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Tony to realise what was happening; You\u2019re having a panic attack again. The realisation made Tony\u2019s heart ache even more. </p><p><i>The ropes tightened around your wrists, making tears form in your eyes.</i></p><p>\u201cHey, hey kid.\u201d Tony tried to push you an arm\u2019s-length away, just enough to look at you, but you hold him right back. </p><p><i>She couldn\u2019t make any noise. She had to stay quiet and tolerate the pain in complete silence. </i></p><p>\u201cY/n, I just want to look at you. Let me look at you kiddo.\u201d Tony asks gently in your ear. </p><p><i>He left the room, leaving her there with her wrists tied and sore. God knows how long she would be there. <b>And it hurts</b></i></p><p>\u201cKid, it\u2019s not real. Whatever you\u2019re reliving it\u2019s not real. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re with me. And you\u2019re safe.\u201d Tony tries to calm you down but you can\u2019t hear him. Or breathe. </p><p>You can\u2019t breathe. All you\u2019re feeling was the tight ropes around you, and it hurt and you <i><b>can\u2019t breathe.</b></i></p><p>Why you can\u2019t breathe? Why did it seem like your lungs are gone? </p><p>\u201cHey, hey. No. Stay with me. You\u2019re not going to pass out on me. Breathe with me kiddo, come on. You can do it.\u201d Tony takes a few deep exaggerated breaths for you copy.</p><p><i>Pass out?</i></p><p>Just then you realise you\u2019re seeing black dots in the corners of your vision and your head seemed heavy, and you still can\u2019t breathe. </p><p>\u201cY/n. Focus on me.\u201d Tony spoke urgently and takes your face in his hands. You try to focus on his worried expression in front of you, but it was getting fuzzy around the edges. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBreathe, kiddo. Slowly. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay now. I promise.\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t working. Tony\u2019s concern and the ache on his heart was only growing. </p><p>\u201cI know you wanna go home kid, so help me, okay? You\u2019ve got to breathe. They probably won\u2019t let me carry you out of here unconscious.\u201d he tried to joke.<i> Like they could stop me if I had to. </i></p><p><i>Home. </i></p><p>You\u2019re going home. </p><p>You finally found his gaze, seeing how desperate he looked. </p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d Tony said again and let out an exaggerated breath for you to copy.</p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>\u201cWe gonna play Monopoly again.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Out.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat movie do you wanna watch? I know Peter made you addicted to Star Wars too.\u201d<br></p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much everybody misses you.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Out.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right kiddo. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d<br></p><p><i>Do it again.</i></p><p>Tony let out a sigh of relief when he sees you breathing normally, looking at youi with kind eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou scared me there for a second.\u201d He tried to joke again, taking a deep breath. </p><p>You look at him, still holding him tightly.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou okay? Ready to go home?\u201d He asks brushing your hair away from your face. </p><p>You nods, feeling the exhaustion starting to get to you. </p><p>He get up holding your hand and helps you to stay on your feet. He quickly thanked Natalie, holding you by your shoulders and led you out of the house. </p><p>Tony helps you get in the car and walks around to the driver side. He fastened his seat belt while watching you closely. You looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>You nods and leans your head against the window of the car, too tired to open your eyes. Your body shivered as a chill ran up your spine.</p><p>Tony noticed the shiver and reached for the temperature dial on the dashboard. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d He asks, narrowing his eyes. </p><p>You nodded again. </p><p>Tony took off his jacket and spread it over you like a blanket. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d </p><p>You give a small nod, almost asleep.</p><p>The relief that Tony felt no long ago, was replaced with worry as he started to drive home. The whole way to the Tower he was taking worried glances at you. You shivered from time to time and looked too pale for Tony\u2019s liking. </p><p>He parked the car in the Tower\u2019s underground garage and looks over at you.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d He called softly. \u201cKid, wake up. We\u2019re here.\u201d He touches your shoulder lightly, but you just made a noise and turns your face further into the door of the car. . </p><p>Tony signs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll have to carry you after all.\u201d </p><p>He opens his door, got out, and walks to your side. He opens the door slowly, with his hand read to catch your head which had been leaning on the window. He looped one arm around your shoulders, the other under your knees, and lifted you out of the car. Tony kicked the door shut with his heel and gripped you more securely as you shifts in his arms. </p><p>\u201cWell, I definitely can feel my age now, huh?\u201d He mutters to himself, as he walks to the door and stepped into the elevator. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, boss. Where would you like me to take you?\u201d Friday asks. </p><p>\u201cY/n\u2019s room, Fri. Quickly.\u201d He says, looking down at you. </p><p>\u201cMr. Rogers requires your presence in the living room, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Friday.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The elevator ascended quickly, and soon you two are in your room. </p><p>He lays you on the bed and carefully covers you with warm blankets, looking at you for a moment. </p><p><i>She\u2019s home. Finally. </i>Tony thought. <i>Everything would be fine now. </i></p><p>But that thought didn\u2019t stay for long. </p><p>You shiver on your blanked, and Tony\u2019s concern grew. </p><p>He sit on your bed and gently places his palm in your forehead, feeling the warmth and the sweat forming on your forehead. </p><p>\u201cShit. Friday, what\u2019s Y/n\u2019s temperature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/n\u2019s temperature it\u2019s currely of 103.5\u201d </p><p><i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. </i></p><p>\u201cFriday, call Bruce, tell him to get here. Now.\u201d Tony says, throwing another blanket over you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. You\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d Tony sit on your bed and watchs you. Your hair was sticking to your pale forehead and you breathing sounds raspy. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Tony hears Bruce at the door. \u201cTony, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p>Tony looks over at Bruce with concerned eyes. </p><p>\u201cY/n. She\u2026 She\u2019s sick. Fever of 103,5.\u201d </p><p>Bruce came closer and looks at you, his professional side kicking in. </p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don't\u2026 I don\u2019t know. The lady who was with her said that she wasn\u2019t eating or leaving her room or\u2026 Bruce do something.\u201d Tony asks, worry evident in his voice. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Tony. You need to calm down. I think she\u2019s only dehydrated.\u201d Bruce says. \u00a0He hold your wrist to take your pulse and waited a few seconds. \u201cShe\u2019s kinda fast and thready. I think it\u2019s best if we put her on an IV and give her fluids. I don\u2019t know how long she went without eating or drinking anything. Let\u2019s take her to the medlab.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods and picks you up in the arms again. Bruce helped with the blankets, and they walked towards the medlab. </p><p>Tony placed you on the hospital bed and stepped back to let Bruce work. Tony sits in the chair next to the bed and watched Bruce hang up bags of fluid. He winced when Bruce slid the IV needle into the top of your hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting normal saline, D5W, and RL She should be fine.\u201d Bruce says while taping the IV in place. . </p><p>\u201cEnglish, Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaline, sugar, and salts. She\u2019ll be fine Tony.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Tony let out a deep breath and nods. </p><p>\u201cThe team is waiting in the living room, Tony. They wanna know what\u2019s happened.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks at Hope and then to Bruce. </p><p>\u201cFriday, let me know if anything changes with her, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d Friday said and he get up, still looking at you. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Bruce.\u201d </p><p>They walked together in silence until they entered the living room and questions erupted from the team.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Loki stood up and asked. </p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Bucky asked. </p><p>\u201cAre they gonna let us keep her?\u201d Peter questioned. </p><p>\u201cHow is she Tony?\u201d Pepper came close and took his hands. </p><p>\u201cLet him speak guys.\u201d Steve got up and raised his hand up to call for silence. The team settled. \u00a0Steve crossed his arms. \u201cHow is she Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home.\u201d Tony let out a deep breath. \u201cShe\u2019s fine, just a little sick and dehydrated, nothing big. They\u2019ll let us keep her long enough to investigate her father and she\u2019ll have to go to school and try to have a normal life with us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll support you.\u201d Wanda said without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to help you and her.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. We\u2019re a team and we\u2019ll work through this together.\u201d Nat said looking confidently at him.</p><p>\u201cY/n is a good kid. Of course we\u2019re gonna help.\u201d Clint said with soft eyes and a smile. </p><p>Tony looked at each one of them and smiled, finally feeling what he hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. </p><p>Supported. </p><p>\u201cThanks guys. I\u2026 I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><hr><p><b></b></p><p><b><i>Taglist:</i></b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxElgVUCBv21LOz1Kb5sMEQ\">@dont-stop-keep-walking</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qNE2JLH-h1qeBF-eTiOUQ\">@keep-a-bucket-full-of-stars</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjT2EnG8Ya4ZmnPnCCRAJfA\">@otomelady</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m917bKjNzPuWxDb8zReLIFQ\">@benispernice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m70S0Pr9mIKE1JULRDYVsZQ\">@what-inspirational-name</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkfGQCp4-aEC5ZdGkQLlVqA\">@pachuh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRayZDnYZaWR33NudZQXLw\">@purplekitten30</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn4HJ3fXqX3D7gNKtzFl0bw\">@sparkling-gayyy</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxR_6HAcrtkOsxsz87epgYA\">@fandom-fangirl07</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG3Wm4cH2k1Jr367ZDIOsCA\">@thefantomfandom</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgN7BD0OGUwSZ3x2Vxly24w\">@just4muggles</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3r6Xl--XL7buPUrl8_JOtA\">@digicharr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGI4ovLFmM3SDswNByjmS_w\">@pietrorunsforme</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miI11MWeMTXQTQu-i5CjGsQ\">@annacarolinafeelings</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzSzz4YNXIES8EeXpImJUQ\">@emygirl</a> </p>",

It had been five days, and Mr. Stark hadn&rsquo;t spoken to you since then. Part of you knew he couldn&rsquo;t, the lawyer you forgot the name of told you that you couldn&rsquo;t speak with Mr. Stark for a while because that could &ldquo;interfere in the proceedings&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>But most of all, you&rsquo;re scared. What if Mr. Stark didn&rsquo;t want you and you would have to live with Arthur and Elizabeth again? You wouldn&rsquo;t even get in the front door before they would you for escaping and ending up living with <b><i>the avengers </i></b>of all people. </p><p>You sighs and looks at your watch. Friday hadn&rsquo;t spoken to you since, but the watch are still working. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, you could swear it was all just a dream. You would swear you never had a family again. </p><p>The truth is, you&rsquo;re starting to doubt, and it sucks because maybe the feelings they had for you was just pity. Maybe they never saw you as you saw them. Maybe you just made yourself a fool again, maybe you was nothing but the homeless and starving girl Loki found. You couldn&rsquo;t help but start to feel tears coming. </p><p>The pain is so strong and you missed them so much, it seemed it would kill you. &nbsp;All you wanted was to go back and play Monopoly and have movie nights with them. Hear Peter talk about Star Wars and spend almost all night with Mr. Stark in the lab, hearing him murmur a song that Friday was playing, too concentrated on what he was doing to notice you hiding a smile. Or even stay up reading with Pepper or see Loki&rsquo;s magic and learn self-defence with Buck. </p><p><i>Bucky</i>. </p><p>You touches the bracelet he gave you, feeling a tear fall. </p><p><i>This will protect me. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; you hear Natalie, the woman you&rsquo;re staying with, knock on the door. &ldquo;I brought you lunch.&rdquo; </p><p>You don&rsquo;t move from the window you&rsquo;re sitting in, just looking at the heavy clouds of the storm that was about to come.</p><p>Natalie peeks in with her head and looks at the sad girl watching the rain. She enters, biting her lip and put the tray on the table and walked towards you. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; </p><p>You don&rsquo;t move. </p><p>&ldquo;I made chicken&hellip;&rdquo; still no response. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you hungry? You didn&rsquo;t eat anything since yesterday&hellip; you&rsquo;ll end up sick.&rdquo; </p><p>She sit next to you looking for the your eyes. &ldquo;Or maybe get out of this room? You&rsquo;ve just stayed &nbsp;here since you arrived&hellip; Earth to Hope&hellip;are you in there?&rdquo; She waves her hand lightly in front of your face. Nothing. She shifts in the same spot, still biting her lips. &ldquo;Look&hellip; I know you&rsquo;re sad and you miss&hellip; them, but you can&rsquo;t stay like this honey&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You don&rsquo;t move, just keep sitting there, and with that light, you look almost lifeless.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; Natalie says, giving up on trying to get something from you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the plate here. If you want something&hellip; Just&hellip; Just let me know.&rdquo; </p><p>She walks slowly to the door, and, before she closed it she looks at you again. </p><p>You really seems like a ghost. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Tony is sitting on the dinner table looking at the security footage of the cameras in the tower, smiling like a fool at seeing they play monopoly together. </p><p>Tony never thought he was this kind of guy, but he was. Peter and you had made him like that. </p><p>He misses you. The house seems so empty without you, and everyone noticed. A part of the family was missing. A member, and it seemed like they had lost you. &nbsp;</p><p>He wants his baby girl back. He want you next to him. That is the only way he could protect you. </p><p>&ldquo;You want me to talk to her, boss?&rdquo; Friday asks him, almost worried. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Fri. We can&rsquo;t. Matt said it&hellip; it isn&rsquo;t good.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you really going to take her, Tony?&rdquo; Friday asks, her accent stronger than before.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. There&rsquo;s no way I would let her be by herself anymore.&rdquo; Tony pause the footage on a frame of &nbsp;you smiling. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t imagine how you&rsquo;re doing. The worry is keeping him up at night. It was like&hellip; it was like someone had taken his kid. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Tony looks behind him and saw Bucky leaning against the wall with a serious face. &ldquo;You have a minute?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony look away and close the hologram. &ldquo;Sure. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p>He come closer and sit on the chair beside Tony. A little awkward moment passes between them but they ignored it. It wasn&rsquo;t the time to bring up the past. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you have new news?&rdquo; Bucky asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, no. Just old ones. Her father, Arthur is with his lawyers and they&rsquo;re investigating her home abuse and&hellip; she&rsquo;s with a lady called Natalie&hellip; Matt is coming with the decision about the guard. Now it's&hellip;we just wait.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony hate to wait. It&rsquo;s out of his control and he hate it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; it's&hellip; about that, that I wanted to talk to you.&rdquo; Bucky begin carefully, directing all Tony&rsquo;s attention to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, you noticed Y/ N and I became close. That&rsquo;s because we&hellip; talked. Not&hellip; not exactly. I talked and&hellip; she listened. One night I came here to get a glass of water and she was crying. I came closer and sat besides her. And, for a moment she didn&rsquo;t look at me, she just keep crying. At some point she stopped and finally looked at me and&hellip; I said &ldquo;I get it. We&rsquo;ve all &nbsp;been there.&rdquo; She looked at me, almost challenging me, like she said: &ldquo;Oh yeah? You&rsquo;ve been through this?&rdquo; and showed me some black marks on her arms. &nbsp;Tony&hellip; I know those marks. It&rsquo;s from a kind of torture with ropes. She&rsquo;s been tortured, Tony. A kid. Our Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky bring his hands to his face and looks back at Tony, who are horrified. </p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t wanted to imagine how Bucky knew this, or how you got those.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let her go back there. She&rsquo;s just a kid. An&hellip; innocent kid. She doesn&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Tony says with determination. &ldquo;She will never go back there.&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky looks into Tony&rsquo;s eyes and see that he meant it. He wouldn&rsquo;t let you, and that was enough for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Bucky says, nodding. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Tony replies, looking away. </p><p>Bucky stays there just for another minute before he get up and starts to walk away.</p><p>&ldquo;Barnes?&rdquo; Tony calls and Bucky turns around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she talked to you.&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky just smiles and nods, walking away right after. </p><p>Yeah, maybe they would heal. </p><p>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Boss? Matt&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; Friday says. </p><p>Tony sighs heavily. </p><p>&ldquo;Let him in.&rdquo; </p><p>He wait a few minutes in silence with his head bowed low trying to prepare himself for whatever news Matt had. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Matt calls. </p><p>Tony looks up at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I sit?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He looks at the hologram again and feel his heart squeeze. </p><p>Matt moves slowly towards him and sit heavily in the chair. </p><p>&ldquo;So, Tony. They&rsquo;ve come to a decision.&rdquo; Matt says with a serious tone. </p><p><i>They&rsquo;ll take her from me, </i>Tony thought </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve allowed her to stay with you &nbsp;provisionally. But, since you want to become her legal guardian, a family court will have to meet to appoint you as such. That day isn&rsquo;t confirmed yet, but it should be soon. You can go pick her up now Tony. You can bring Y/N home.&rdquo; Matt says with a smile. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony asks with wide eyes. &ldquo;They really&hellip; they&rsquo;ll let me keep her?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, as I said, you&rsquo;ll have the provisional guardianship, and she&rsquo;ll have to go to school. You have to proof to them that she can be well treated and have a normal life.&rdquo; Matt explained. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no problem. I-I can put her in the same school as Peter. He can help her.&rdquo; He spoke fast, gesturing with his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;That would be great. We don&rsquo;t know exactly how long it will take for them to come to a conclusion.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah! Great!&rdquo; He stand up, smiling broadly &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go pick her up now. The lady knows about -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; Matt interrupts him with a serious face that took Tony smile away. &ldquo;I have to warn you, that guy, her father, he&rsquo;s not a good person.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Tell about it. How could a man who tortures his little girl be a good person.&rdquo; Tony says with a cold voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Torture?&rdquo; Matt raises an eyebrow. </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky told me he saw marks on Hope&rsquo;s arms, and that he knew what caused those kinds of marks. It&rsquo;s a kind of torture with ropes&hellip; God, I don&rsquo;t wanna imagine what else this kid suffered.&rdquo; Tony closes his eyes, trying not to think about his kid crying in pain at Arthur&rsquo;s hands. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be good for the court proceedings&rdquo; Matt says as he nodded. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about. The man was furious, Tony. He&rsquo;s&hellip; Dangerous. And his wife isn&rsquo;t much different. We have to be careful, for y/n sake.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know. We will.&rdquo; Tony says with intensity, and Matt knew that he meant it. </p><p>He leans back in the chair again and smiled. &ldquo;What are you waiting for? Go get her.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony smiles and almost ran out of the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Friday, if someone asks for me, tell them what happened. Oh! And thank Matt for me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Got it, Boss.&rdquo; Friday replies with a cheerful voice. </p><p>Tony would finally see you again and be able to protect you. </p><p>How could he ever think of leaving you in the hands of strangers? He couldn&rsquo;t imagine their lives without you now. Or no monopoly afternoons, or movie nights with Pepper, Peter and you. Life before the arrival of the sweet, quiet girl who arrived at Tony&rsquo;s house weeks ago seemed distant and unreal to him.&nbsp;</p><p>He parks out in front of the large house and took a deep breath. It&rsquo;s big and comfortable. It&rsquo;s a good place for you but, it isn&rsquo;t right. </p><p>He stepped out of the car and walks towards the front door. He pauses for a moment, holding his breath, and then knocks on the door. </p><p>Seconds passes before a blond woman with kind eyes opens the door. &nbsp;A shocked expression spread across her face. </p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mrs. Lopez. I&rsquo;m here to bring Hope home.&rdquo; Tony says with a kind smile as he saw the woman&rsquo;s expression change to relief. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thank God!&rdquo; Natalie says as she brings her hands to her chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s wrong with her?&rdquo; Tony smile rapidly fades away to a &nbsp;worried expression. </p><p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t eat or leave her room, ..&nbsp; she&rsquo;s so sad&hellip; And I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; She says with a guilty expression. </p><p>&ldquo;Take me to her.&rdquo; Tony says, entering in the house.</p><p>They walks in silence until they reaches your door&rsquo;s. Natalie opens it slowly and sighs sadly upon seeing that the food she brought earlier was still there, untouched. She stepped aside to let Tony enter the room..</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n? There&rsquo;s someone here to see you.&rdquo; </p><p>You suddenly froze. It was Arthur, wasn&rsquo;t it? He would take you. He would hurt you again. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey there.&rdquo; Tony says lightly as he walks towards you slowly. </p><p>You&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s your mind tricking you. You&rsquo;re hallucinating. Mr. Stark wasn&rsquo;t there. The moment you turn around, it was going to be Arthur standing there with <b><i>that</i></b> smile. </p><p><i>I&rsquo;m fucked. </i></p><p>You turn around and look at him, blinking to make the vision disappear.&nbsp;</p><p>But it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony is there looking at you with a worried expression. The relief you felt was so strong that you feel tears coming almost immediately. </p><p>You run to him so fast you stumbled a bit, but Tony knelt down and caught you up in a hug which prevented you from falling</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;re fine. I&rsquo;ve got you. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; Tony keep repeating like a mantra in your ear, and without even realising it, you started to cry. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, baby girl.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice broke, his heart too. He couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it was fear or your crying causing you to shake, but either way, he could feel how scared you&rsquo;re. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here. I promised you, didn&rsquo;t I? We going home.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>I was so scared. I thought you would leave me. I thought that I never would see you again. I thought I would have to live with him. I thought that I would be alone again. I don&rsquo;t wanna be alone anymore. <b>Please</b>.</i></p><p>You let out a small sob as you tried to breathe properly. </p><p><i>He took the rope with a ghostly smile on his face.</i></p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Tony to realise what was happening; You&rsquo;re having a panic attack again. The realisation made Tony&rsquo;s heart ache even more. </p><p><i>The ropes tightened around your wrists, making tears form in your eyes.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey kid.&rdquo; Tony tried to push you an arm&rsquo;s-length away, just enough to look at you, but you hold him right back. </p><p><i>She couldn&rsquo;t make any noise. She had to stay quiet and tolerate the pain in complete silence. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, I just want to look at you. Let me look at you kiddo.&rdquo; Tony asks gently in your ear. </p><p><i>He left the room, leaving her there with her wrists tied and sore. God knows how long she would be there. <b>And it hurts</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Kid, it&rsquo;s not real. Whatever you&rsquo;re reliving it&rsquo;s not real. You&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;re with me. And you&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo; Tony tries to calm you down but you can&rsquo;t hear him. Or breathe. </p><p>You can&rsquo;t breathe. All you&rsquo;re feeling was the tight ropes around you, and it hurt and you <i><b>can&rsquo;t breathe.</b></i></p><p>Why you can&rsquo;t breathe? Why did it seem like your lungs are gone? </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey. No. Stay with me. You&rsquo;re not going to pass out on me. Breathe with me kiddo, come on. You can do it.&rdquo; Tony takes a few deep exaggerated breaths for you copy.</p><p><i>Pass out?</i></p><p>Just then you realise you&rsquo;re seeing black dots in the corners of your vision and your head seemed heavy, and you still can&rsquo;t breathe. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n. Focus on me.&rdquo; Tony spoke urgently and takes your face in his hands. You try to focus on his worried expression in front of you, but it was getting fuzzy around the edges. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Breathe, kiddo. Slowly. It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s okay now. I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t working. Tony&rsquo;s concern and the ache on his heart was only growing. </p><p>&ldquo;I know you wanna go home kid, so help me, okay? You&rsquo;ve got to breathe. They probably won&rsquo;t let me carry you out of here unconscious.&rdquo; he tried to joke.<i> Like they could stop me if I had to. </i></p><p><i>Home. </i></p><p>You&rsquo;re going home. </p><p>You finally found his gaze, seeing how desperate he looked. </p><p>&ldquo;Breathe.&rdquo; Tony said again and let out an exaggerated breath for you to copy.</p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>&ldquo;We gonna play Monopoly again.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>Out.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What movie do you wanna watch? I know Peter made you addicted to Star Wars too.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>In.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much everybody misses you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>Out.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right kiddo. You&rsquo;re doing great.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>Do it again.</i></p><p>Tony let out a sigh of relief when he sees you breathing normally, looking at youi with kind eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You scared me there for a second.&rdquo; He tried to joke again, taking a deep breath. </p><p>You look at him, still holding him tightly.</p><p><b></b></p><p>&ldquo;You okay? Ready to go home?&rdquo; He asks brushing your hair away from your face. </p><p>You nods, feeling the exhaustion starting to get to you. </p><p>He get up holding your hand and helps you to stay on your feet. He quickly thanked Natalie, holding you by your shoulders and led you out of the house. </p><p>Tony helps you get in the car and walks around to the driver side. He fastened his seat belt while watching you closely. You looked exhausted.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; </p><p>You nods and leans your head against the window of the car, too tired to open your eyes. Your body shivered as a chill ran up your spine.</p><p>Tony noticed the shiver and reached for the temperature dial on the dashboard. &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; He asks, narrowing his eyes. </p><p>You nodded again. </p><p>Tony took off his jacket and spread it over you like a blanket. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; </p><p>You give a small nod, almost asleep.</p><p>The relief that Tony felt no long ago, was replaced with worry as he started to drive home. The whole way to the Tower he was taking worried glances at you. You shivered from time to time and looked too pale for Tony&rsquo;s liking. </p><p>He parked the car in the Tower&rsquo;s underground garage and looks over at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; He called softly. &ldquo;Kid, wake up. We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He touches your shoulder lightly, but you just made a noise and turns your face further into the door of the car. . </p><p>Tony signs. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have to carry you after all.&rdquo; </p><p>He opens his door, got out, and walks to your side. He opens the door slowly, with his hand read to catch your head which had been leaning on the window. He looped one arm around your shoulders, the other under your knees, and lifted you out of the car. Tony kicked the door shut with his heel and gripped you more securely as you shifts in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I definitely can feel my age now, huh?&rdquo; He mutters to himself, as he walks to the door and stepped into the elevator. </p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, boss. Where would you like me to take you?&rdquo; Friday asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n&rsquo;s room, Fri. Quickly.&rdquo; He says, looking down at you. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Rogers requires your presence in the living room, boss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Later, Friday.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The elevator ascended quickly, and soon you two are in your room. </p><p>He lays you on the bed and carefully covers you with warm blankets, looking at you for a moment. </p><p><i>She&rsquo;s home. Finally. </i>Tony thought. <i>Everything would be fine now. </i></p><p>But that thought didn&rsquo;t stay for long. </p><p>You shiver on your blanked, and Tony&rsquo;s concern grew. </p><p>He sit on your bed and gently places his palm in your forehead, feeling the warmth and the sweat forming on your forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit. Friday, what&rsquo;s Y/n&rsquo;s temperature?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n&rsquo;s temperature it&rsquo;s currely of 103.5&rdquo; </p><p><i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Friday, call Bruce, tell him to get here. Now.&rdquo; Tony says, throwing another blanket over you. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, honey. You&rsquo;re gonna be okay.&rdquo; Tony sit on your bed and watchs you. Your hair was sticking to your pale forehead and you breathing sounds raspy. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Tony hears Bruce at the door. &ldquo;Tony, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looks over at Bruce with concerned eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n. She&hellip; She&rsquo;s sick. Fever of 103,5.&rdquo; </p><p>Bruce came closer and looks at you, his professional side kicking in. </p><p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don't&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. The lady who was with her said that she wasn&rsquo;t eating or leaving her room or&hellip; Bruce do something.&rdquo; Tony asks, worry evident in his voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Tony. You need to calm down. I think she&rsquo;s only dehydrated.&rdquo; Bruce says. &nbsp;He hold your wrist to take your pulse and waited a few seconds. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s kinda fast and thready. I think it&rsquo;s best if we put her on an IV and give her fluids. I don&rsquo;t know how long she went without eating or drinking anything. Let&rsquo;s take her to the medlab.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods and picks you up in the arms again. Bruce helped with the blankets, and they walked towards the medlab. </p><p>Tony placed you on the hospital bed and stepped back to let Bruce work. Tony sits in the chair next to the bed and watched Bruce hang up bags of fluid. He winced when Bruce slid the IV needle into the top of your hand. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s getting normal saline, D5W, and RL She should be fine.&rdquo; Bruce says while taping the IV in place. . </p><p>&ldquo;English, Bruce?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saline, sugar, and salts. She&rsquo;ll be fine Tony.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Tony let out a deep breath and nods. </p><p>&ldquo;The team is waiting in the living room, Tony. They wanna know what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looks at Hope and then to Bruce. </p><p>&ldquo;Friday, let me know if anything changes with her, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing, boss.&rdquo; Friday said and he get up, still looking at you. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Bruce.&rdquo; </p><p>They walked together in silence until they entered the living room and questions erupted from the team.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Loki stood up and asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Is she okay?&rdquo; Bucky asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Are they gonna let us keep her?&rdquo; Peter questioned. </p><p>&ldquo;How is she Tony?&rdquo; Pepper came close and took his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Let him speak guys.&rdquo; Steve got up and raised his hand up to call for silence. The team settled. &nbsp;Steve crossed his arms. &ldquo;How is she Tony?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s home.&rdquo; Tony let out a deep breath. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine, just a little sick and dehydrated, nothing big. They&rsquo;ll let us keep her long enough to investigate her father and she&rsquo;ll have to go to school and try to have a normal life with us.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll support you.&rdquo; Wanda said without hesitation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do everything we can to help you and her.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;re a team and we&rsquo;ll work through this together.&rdquo; Nat said looking confidently at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n is a good kid. Of course we&rsquo;re gonna help.&rdquo; Clint said with soft eyes and a smile. </p><p>Tony looked at each one of them and smiled, finally feeling what he hadn&rsquo;t felt in a long time. </p><p>Supported. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks guys. I&hellip; I really appreciate it.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><b></b></p><p><b><i>Taglist:</i></b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxElgVUCBv21LOz1Kb5sMEQ\">@dont-stop-keep-walking</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qNE2JLH-h1qeBF-eTiOUQ\">@keep-a-bucket-full-of-stars</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjT2EnG8Ya4ZmnPnCCRAJfA\">@otomelady</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m917bKjNzPuWxDb8zReLIFQ\">@benispernice</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m70S0Pr9mIKE1JULRDYVsZQ\">@what-inspirational-name</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkfGQCp4-aEC5ZdGkQLlVqA\">@pachuh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRayZDnYZaWR33NudZQXLw\">@purplekitten30</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn4HJ3fXqX3D7gNKtzFl0bw\">@sparkling-gayyy</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxR_6HAcrtkOsxsz87epgYA\">@fandom-fangirl07</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG3Wm4cH2k1Jr367ZDIOsCA\">@thefantomfandom</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgN7BD0OGUwSZ3x2Vxly24w\">@just4muggles</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3r6Xl--XL7buPUrl8_JOtA\">@digicharr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGI4ovLFmM3SDswNByjmS_w\">@pietrorunsforme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miI11MWeMTXQTQu-i5CjGsQ\">@annacarolinafeelings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzSzz4YNXIES8EeXpImJUQ\">@emygirl</a> </p>",
