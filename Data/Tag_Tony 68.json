How come we were wrong?\u201d Clint jumped in, dropping the drumsticks from his grasp, quickly sitting beside of Pietro and Sam, Bucky besides the latter- bullying Peter. \u201cWasn\u2019t its Thor and his father that reported about spotting Eviana at Nornheim?\u201d Thor\u2019s gaze dropped at the guy in front of him \u201cYes. But it appears that it was also Korvac\u2019s undertaking for our satellite to pick up the incorrect signal-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSatellite?\u201d \u00a0Peter innocently asked, popping a goldfish into his mouth. \u201cYou have a dirt on your face.\u201d Tony sheepishly said, handing the kid with a napkin. \u201cTh-Thanks Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo. Thank you, kid.\u201d From a far, Steve watched as Tony interact with Peter. A blush creeping onto the kid\u2019s face, a wide grin plastered on his face as Tony wiped the crumbs of his biscuit. Steve might not be there to witness the suffering Tony experienced, but it was when he was informed that Peter also left the guy- that made him worry terribly. Along with Eviana, It was Peter that Tony got his strength from. He treated the boy as if he was his own, and Peter treated the old guy as his dad. And in the chaos their team-or rather family went through- It was the love of Peter and Tony that made all of them hope too.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo where do you think Korvac took Eviana?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure how you call it. But it\u2019s near Saturn. Only three jumps from Ego\u2019s planet.\u201d Banner muttered, his hand quickly typing onto the abused keyboard- wanting to have their questions answered as quickly as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s blurred.I can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Chandillar.\u201d The team looked back, and there they saw a familiar face. Steve and Tony quickly greeting the guy. \u201cHello, Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s quite a surprise for you to visit us,Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSteven. Anthony.\u201d Charles addressed, as he rolled himself into the center. \u00a0\u201cIt warms my heart to see you altogether.\u201d The doctor smiled, his eyes searching for a familiar eyes- spotting it in an instant. His smile growing wider, \u201cHello, Charles\u201d Wanda mumbled, quickly giving the doctor a hug. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cMaximoff.\u201d As Bruce handed the tablet to the doctor, Charles did nothing but ignore him-quickly placing his two forefingers into the side of his tempolar. \u201cYou should all get rid of your worries. Eviana-she needs you.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u201cDo you think; we\u2019re doing the right thing?\u201d Steve asked, his eyes hopeful. \u201cCan you reach to her, doctor?\u201d Charles frowned, letting the team what he was truly feeling-a profound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock. His hands hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and staring before Stere, his eyes glazed with threathening tears. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cI saw her.\u201d Charles murmured, the rest of the team gasping-\u201cHer eyes have frozen over like the surface of a winter puddle, robbing them of their usual warmth. She&rsquo;s in there, I know it, but it&rsquo;s like she just took a huge step back from life. I want to reach in and tell her it isn&rsquo;t hopeless, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cW-Why?You\u2019ve always done it Professor. You\u2019ve done that with us!With her, when she was younger.\u201d Tony asked, gritting his teeth as the memory of you screaming in pain replayed in his mind. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cI have no idea either.\u201d Charles muttered, trying to think why his vision and connection with Eviana was interrupted \u201cIt was interrupted, as I was about to talk to her- She shut down. As if her mind was wiped over\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWiped over? Like it was rebooted?\u201d Sam wondered, Wanda quickly jumping- \u201cYes!I\u2019ve felt that too!She-Uhm, Eviana-She recognized me,And as I was about to talk to her further-She was already gone. It was as if she was taken again.Away.\u201d Wanda jested, her eyes beaming like a child\u2019s. \u201cIt was so sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI think it might have to do with Korvac.\u201d Charles exclaimed, his eyes expecting the reaction of the team. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean? What did that monster do?\u201d Bucky scoffed, his knuckles pale as he clenched his fist. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been scheming around, Erik and the team have been helping me, we tried to come up with any calculation on how come everything that your team and our family has done-it still failed us to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd?\u201d Natasha exclaimed, impatient. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe think that Korvac took Eviana, at Chandillar.\u201d Thor quickly took the tablet from Bruce, typing away as Charles continued. \u201cIt\u2019s near Nornheim-and Saturn,it\u2019s a small place, compared to Nornheim-But many creatures stay there. Along with my late wife, <i>Lilandra Neramani</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s where the Shi-Ar empire resides. Along with some kronans, and their late master-Korvus.\u201d Thor grunted, as Bruce quickly played the animation of the Chandillar- on the holograms- as Tony and the team, checked it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt looks significantly different from Nornheim. So, how come we were directed there?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt must\u2019ve been Korvac. The technology in Chandillar is compelling, they might\u2019ve hacked your system.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Tony argued, Bruce backing him up. \u201cSTARK Tech. is horrifyingly impossible to override.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI agree with these two.\u201d T\u2019challa grunts, \u201cAlong with the technology we have back home, it\u2019s only Stark\u2019s technology that can meet our standards. Also, Shuri- she helped with the upgrade. And no one dares to question a princess\u2019 capabilities.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI meant no offense, your highness. But I\u2019m just pointing out what we think happened\u201d Charles exclaimed. \u201cLilandra, My ex-wife. She was great with technology, knew everything about it. Along with this, She-She had a friend, who was a chemist-a scientist. He was also human, but he acquired physical characteristics through exposure to a few mutagenic agents such as chemicals, and radiation. It was his experiment to his own self, unfortunately- it was successful, and now he\u2019s a mutate.I think, he worked with Korvac, alongside Lilandra-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u201cVictor? You mean, Doctor Victor von Doom?\u201d Wanda gasped \u201cI met a few decades ago. He was one of my\u2026. suitors.\u201d Vision automatically looking at her \u201c It was a thing back then, because of our unions.But if it\u2019s really Victor, then what you\u2019re saying-it must be true.\u201dWanda blabbered.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhen I met him, He was always talking about his friend. I\u2019ve never met him though, but he would always talk about how this guy had a vision about the world and that how he would change it\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd how does Eviana fits into that?\u201d Tony queried. \u00a0\u201cI even doubt that Eviana was born by that time. So, how?\u201d He continued, calculating the timelines.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d Pietro stepped up, a look of horror etched on his face \u201cIt was when his late wife, Carina-died.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u201cCarina!\u201d Wanda gasped, her eyes shifted to the side again and became glazed with a glassy layer of tears. As she blinked, they dripped from her eyelids and slid down her cheeks. \u201cWhen I-I connected with her\u2026That\u2019s what she said, that it was her name. That she was a Queen, I wasn\u2019t able to hear what place but when I called her, she spat at me. Telling me Eviana wasn\u2019t her name.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDo you remember when we met her? Lady Carina, she was such a delight. Even though Korvac was evil, Carina never changed. She was such a sunshine, a pleasure to talk to and be with.\u201d Pietro exclaimed. \u201cCarina, she died the same year Eviana joined us.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0The team quickly took their own holograms, trying to calculate everything as they search for any connections. Tony commanded FRIDAY to show every data they have ever since your disappearance as Clint and Natasha looked for files regarding the mentioned former Queen. As the team work,Steve could only watch from a far as doubt suddenly shoots through him like a piercing arrow destroying resistance- asking himself if he was ready; ready for another heartbreak, or another trip down to the loneliness road.He was too busy faling into the pit of darkness, when he felt a light tap on his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her Steve.\u201d Wanda whispered, smiling genuinely at the captain. \u201cI promise you; this will be the last time that we\u2019d go through this pain looking for Eviana.\u201d If she had ever known failure in his life, it didn&rsquo;t show. Everything from the way she held herself, to the way she spoke, to that look of unassailable confidence in her eyes said they could do it. That they can finally bring you back home. It was as if on cue, that Bruce stood, shakingly removing his eyeglasses, his mouth-agape. Steve\u2019s hand shot up over his mouth, trying to keep control of his nerves as he felt his \u00a0heart begin to race and pound inside his chest. \u00a0\u201cEve\u2026\u201d With a quick glance around the room, everyone\u2019s eyes were on the doctor, Tony furiously dashing towards the latter\u2019s computer. You sought out Wanda, seeing her leaning against Vision with her hands anxiously clasped in front of her face. \u201cI found her. \u2018Iana, S-She\u2019s alive.\u201d</p>",

How come we were wrong?\u201d Clint jumped in, dropping the drumsticks from his grasp, quickly sitting beside of Pietro and Sam, Bucky besides the latter- bullying Peter. \u201cWasn\u2019t its Thor and his father that reported about spotting Eviana at Nornheim?\u201d Thor\u2019s gaze dropped at the guy in front of him \u201cYes. But it appears that it was also Korvac\u2019s undertaking for our satellite to pick up the incorrect signal-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSatellite?\u201d \u00a0Peter innocently asked, popping a goldfish into his mouth. \u201cYou have a dirt on your face.\u201d Tony sheepishly said, handing the kid with a napkin. \u201cTh-Thanks Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo. Thank you, kid.\u201d From a far, Steve watched as Tony interact with Peter. A blush creeping onto the kid\u2019s face, a wide grin plastered on his face as Tony wiped the crumbs of his biscuit. Steve might not be there to witness the suffering Tony experienced, but it was when he was informed that Peter also left the guy- that made him worry terribly. Along with Eviana, It was Peter that Tony got his strength from. He treated the boy as if he was his own, and Peter treated the old guy as his dad. And in the chaos their team-or rather family went through- It was the love of Peter and Tony that made all of them hope too.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo where do you think Korvac took Eviana?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure how you call it. But it\u2019s near Saturn. Only three jumps from Ego\u2019s planet.\u201d Banner muttered, his hand quickly typing onto the abused keyboard- wanting to have their questions answered as quickly as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s blurred.I can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Chandillar.\u201d The team looked back, and there they saw a familiar face. Steve and Tony quickly greeting the guy. \u201cHello, Avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s quite a surprise for you to visit us,Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSteven. Anthony.\u201d Charles addressed, as he rolled himself into the center. \u00a0\u201cIt warms my heart to see you altogether.\u201d The doctor smiled, his eyes searching for a familiar eyes- spotting it in an instant. His smile growing wider, \u201cHello, Charles\u201d Wanda mumbled, quickly giving the doctor a hug. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cMaximoff.\u201d As Bruce handed the tablet to the doctor, Charles did nothing but ignore him-quickly placing his two forefingers into the side of his tempolar. \u201cYou should all get rid of your worries. Eviana-she needs you.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u201cDo you think; we\u2019re doing the right thing?\u201d Steve asked, his eyes hopeful. \u201cCan you reach to her, doctor?\u201d Charles frowned, letting the team what he was truly feeling-a profound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock. His hands hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and staring before Stere, his eyes glazed with threathening tears. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cI saw her.\u201d Charles murmured, the rest of the team gasping-\u201cHer eyes have frozen over like the surface of a winter puddle, robbing them of their usual warmth. She\u2019s in there, I know it, but it\u2019s like she just took a huge step back from life. I want to reach in and tell her it isn\u2019t hopeless, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cW-Why?You\u2019ve always done it Professor. You\u2019ve done that with us!With her, when she was younger.\u201d Tony asked, gritting his teeth as the memory of you screaming in pain replayed in his mind. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cI have no idea either.\u201d Charles muttered, trying to think why his vision and connection with Eviana was interrupted \u201cIt was interrupted, as I was about to talk to her- She shut down. As if her mind was wiped over\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWiped over? Like it was rebooted?\u201d Sam wondered, Wanda quickly jumping- \u201cYes!I\u2019ve felt that too!She-Uhm, Eviana-She recognized me,And as I was about to talk to her further-She was already gone. It was as if she was taken again.Away.\u201d Wanda jested, her eyes beaming like a child\u2019s. \u201cIt was so sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI think it might have to do with Korvac.\u201d Charles exclaimed, his eyes expecting the reaction of the team. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean? What did that monster do?\u201d Bucky scoffed, his knuckles pale as he clenched his fist. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been scheming around, Erik and the team have been helping me, we tried to come up with any calculation on how come everything that your team and our family has done-it still failed us to save her.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd?\u201d Natasha exclaimed, impatient. </p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe think that Korvac took Eviana, at Chandillar.\u201d Thor quickly took the tablet from Bruce, typing away as Charles continued. \u201cIt\u2019s near Nornheim-and Saturn,it\u2019s a small place, compared to Nornheim-But many creatures stay there. Along with my late wife, <i>Lilandra Neramani</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s where the Shi-Ar empire resides. Along with some kronans, and their late master-Korvus.\u201d Thor grunted, as Bruce quickly played the animation of the Chandillar- on the holograms- as Tony and the team, checked it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt looks significantly different from Nornheim. So, how come we were directed there?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cIt must\u2019ve been Korvac. The technology in Chandillar is compelling, they might\u2019ve hacked your system.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Tony argued, Bruce backing him up. \u201cSTARK Tech. is horrifyingly impossible to override.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI agree with these two.\u201d T\u2019challa grunts, \u201cAlong with the technology we have back home, it\u2019s only Stark\u2019s technology that can meet our standards. Also, Shuri- she helped with the upgrade. And no one dares to question a princess\u2019 capabilities.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI meant no offense, your highness. But I\u2019m just pointing out what we think happened\u201d Charles exclaimed. \u201cLilandra, My ex-wife. She was great with technology, knew everything about it. Along with this, She-She had a friend, who was a chemist-a scientist. He was also human, but he acquired physical characteristics through exposure to a few mutagenic agents such as chemicals, and radiation. It was his experiment to his own self, unfortunately- it was successful, and now he\u2019s a mutate.I think, he worked with Korvac, alongside Lilandra-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u201cVictor? You mean, Doctor Victor von Doom?\u201d Wanda gasped \u201cI met a few decades ago. He was one of my\u2026. suitors.\u201d Vision automatically looking at her \u201c It was a thing back then, because of our unions.But if it\u2019s really Victor, then what you\u2019re saying-it must be true.\u201dWanda blabbered.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhen I met him, He was always talking about his friend. I\u2019ve never met him though, but he would always talk about how this guy had a vision about the world and that how he would change it\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cAnd how does Eviana fits into that?\u201d Tony queried. \u00a0\u201cI even doubt that Eviana was born by that time. So, how?\u201d He continued, calculating the timelines.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe doesn\u2019t.\u201d Pietro stepped up, a look of horror etched on his face \u201cIt was when his late wife, Carina-died.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u201cCarina!\u201d Wanda gasped, her eyes shifted to the side again and became glazed with a glassy layer of tears. As she blinked, they dripped from her eyelids and slid down her cheeks. \u201cWhen I-I connected with her\u2026That\u2019s what she said, that it was her name. That she was a Queen, I wasn\u2019t able to hear what place but when I called her, she spat at me. Telling me Eviana wasn\u2019t her name.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cDo you remember when we met her? Lady Carina, she was such a delight. Even though Korvac was evil, Carina never changed. She was such a sunshine, a pleasure to talk to and be with.\u201d Pietro exclaimed. \u201cCarina, she died the same year Eviana joined us.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0The team quickly took their own holograms, trying to calculate everything as they search for any connections. Tony commanded FRIDAY to show every data they have ever since your disappearance as Clint and Natasha looked for files regarding the mentioned former Queen. As the team work,Steve could only watch from a far as doubt suddenly shoots through him like a piercing arrow destroying resistance- asking himself if he was ready; ready for another heartbreak, or another trip down to the loneliness road.He was too busy faling into the pit of darkness, when he felt a light tap on his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her Steve.\u201d Wanda whispered, smiling genuinely at the captain. \u201cI promise you; this will be the last time that we\u2019d go through this pain looking for Eviana.\u201d If she had ever known failure in his life, it didn\u2019t show. Everything from the way she held herself, to the way she spoke, to that look of unassailable confidence in her eyes said they could do it. That they can finally bring you back home. It was as if on cue, that Bruce stood, shakingly removing his eyeglasses, his mouth-agape. Steve\u2019s hand shot up over his mouth, trying to keep control of his nerves as he felt his \u00a0heart begin to race and pound inside his chest. \u00a0\u201cEve\u2026\u201d With a quick glance around the room, everyone\u2019s eyes were on the doctor, Tony furiously dashing towards the latter\u2019s computer. You sought out Wanda, seeing her leaning against Vision with her hands anxiously clasped in front of her face. \u201cI found her. \u2018Iana, S-She\u2019s alive.\u201d</p></p>",
