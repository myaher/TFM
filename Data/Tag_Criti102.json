I am not brave enough for that. There is a comfort in iron, a promise of safety, a second chance if mistakes</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">are made. But a city is more a forest than a sword. No, it needs more tending than that.Perhaps a city is like a garden, then.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">So these days, it seems I have become a gardener. I dig foundations in the earth. I sow rows of houses. I plan and plant. I watch the skies for rain and ruin. I cannot help but think that you would be better at this, but circumstance has put both of us in our own odd place. You are forced to be a hammer in the world, and my ungentle hands are learning how to tend a plot of land.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">We must do what we can do.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Did you know that there are some seeds that cannot sprout unless they are first burned? A friend once told me that. She was&ndash; she was a bookish sort. I think of gardening constantly these days. I wear your gift, and I think of you, and I think it is interesting that there are some living things that need to pass through fire before they flourish.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">I ramble. You have the heart of a gardener, and because of this, you think of consequence, and your current path pains you. I am not wise, and I do not give advice, but I have come to know a few things: sometimes breaking is making, even iron can start again, and there are many things that move through fire and find themselves much better for it afterward.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">I have enclosed a gift. Once it was a sword, but it has changed. It is a small thing, and silly.Please forgive an old man for his foolishness. Still, I hope it brings you some small comfort.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Kindly, Kerr.</p><p>(Enclosed is a ring of iron with branches engraved with the words &ldquo;I have passed through fire&rdquo;)</p>",
