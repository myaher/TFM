Perhaps it would be easier using the library\u2019s search system, as all the works he\u2019s going through are uploaded into the system anyway, but he has a thing about being authentic.

He\u2019d love to meet them someday, but for now, he\u2019s only interested in local history. If you\u2019ll remember, he\u2019s looking for anyone who might have been able to get out of an arranged marriage.

Her name is Mikaleiagh, and she died in what would be 2127 our time. She was destined to marry her husband Ron, but for some reason that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the text, it never happened.

And then, out of the blue, Phil develops a worrying obsession with a girl from the other side. She embodies everything Dan hates; he tries to explain this to Phil, to no avail. As his obsession with Amanda grows, as does Dan\u2019s loathing for her. Still, it shouldn\u2019t bug Dan this much to see his friend pine some braindead bimbo relying on her boyfriend\u2019s wallet.

embracing yourself? as a person? as whoever you truly are? and they keep coming back to the idea of authenticity with this whole album, and i think that\u2019s part of why dan would be so\u00a0\u2018attacked\u2019 by this album bc he\u2019s in the throes of his own search for authenticity</p><p>love it if we made it (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzWt3EUsqiw\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this one\u2019s fun bc it\u2019s basically all about how fucked up society is and like. all the things that\u2019ve gone wrong, how society is just so beyond messed up, and it\u2019s like. yes. all of this is so wrong, messed up, but there\u2019s hope? like we can be self-aware, we can make differences, and i would imagine dan listening to this and feeling like. maybe torn? because there are some things where he\u2019s trying to make a difference but some where he would want to but not know how? so y\u2019know personal attack on him in the sense that it\u2019s a personal attack on everyone - we\u2019re all complicit, in a way, and part of it is just because we <i>know</i>\u00a0all this is happening but how much do any of us try to enact change? i imagine that\u2019s something that keeps dan up at night, tbh. i mean the man spent an hour picking up snails off a sidewalk so they wouldn\u2019t get squished</p><p>be my mistake (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-be-my-mistake-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this one is interesting bc the artist explains it\u2019s really just about guilt, on a deeper level, and about not knowing what you want? ultimately even tho it\u2019s about like a hookup with someone you don\u2019t know that you really want, i think dan would take this more at the deep level of like. having no idea what he wants in life (something he\u2019s said before, multiple times) and? perhaps in a sense, going back to things that he knows don\u2019t actually represent what he wants (ie, that don\u2019t feel authentic) but knowing the outcome and maybe just feeling safe or at least feeling <i>something</i>\u00a0significant from them, maybe like he\u2019s fulfilling what other people want of him by doing these things even if they don\u2019t quite feel like <i>him</i></p><p>sincerity is scary (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r3KmwdOWVQ\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>,<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-sincerity-is-scary-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i think this is one of the ones dan would feel calls him out the most - it\u2019s all about a person\u2019s relationship with social media, authenticity, and self-perception over external perception? so like. the entire first verse is all about hiding behind a mask of irony and like. i think for dan that\u2019s a hard-hitting callout? and i don\u2019t just mean his whole brand of how <i>everything</i>\u00a0was done/said\u00a0\u2018ironically\u2019, more that even now he hides his fears behind jokes and such, bc that\u2019s a culturally relevant way to do things (\u2019you try and mask your pain in the most post-modern way\u2019). the whole idea is like. if you\u2019re being ironic, if you\u2019re masking everything behind jokes and insincerity, you can\u2019t <i>actually</i>\u00a0be judged the way you can if you\u2019re authentic and sincere? so like. there\u2019s dan\u2019s fear of judgment plastered all over this song, his fear of people looking at him for who he is and disliking it or perceiving it in a way he doesn\u2019t like (\u2019and why would you believe you could control how you\u2019re perceived when at your best you\u2019re intermediately versed in your own feelings\u2019) it\u2019s like. and he\u2019s said this a couple times now, but he doesn\u2019t always <i>know</i>\u00a0why he does/thinks certain things, there\u2019s not always a reasoning behind it, and i think that for him, that contributes to his struggles with authenticity. i think this is really doubly intriguing when ttlmt is taken into account as well? bc he specifically says that for \u2018some people\u2019 (aka him i mean this is known at this point) unless they\u2019re being honest with themselves, they won\u2019t feel free. and i think that\u2019s like. dan\u2019s internal struggle right now/this past year: how to balance his evident need for authentic and honest self-expression with his deep-rooted fear of judgment of his authentic self. i mean read the damn title of the song, sincerity <i>is</i>\u00a0scary</p><p>i like america &amp; america likes me (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-i-like-america-and-america-likes-me-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i\u2019m sure there\u2019s a deeper meaning to how dan would interpret it (aside from the obvious and intentional callout about guns in america) but all i can think about is talking about being on fire, being a liar,\u00a0\u2018is that designer?\u2019 etc, and the death of dinof. but also y\u2019know about calling out things that are Wrong\u00a0</p><p>the man who married a robot / love theme (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-the-man-who-married-a-robot-love-theme-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i think this one is maybe one that dan felt absolutely <i>viscerally</i>\u00a0attacked by, this is a direct callout on his relationship with the internet and his audience. it\u2019s presented as a relationship, a friendship, a love, but like if you step back and go\u00a0\u2018this is about a person and an audience\u2019 it\u2019s so so much more heartbreaking. i mean the internet saying\u00a0\u2018i love you very very much&hellip;i never ever want us to be apart ever again ever\u2019 like that\u2019s us that\u2019s literally us we want constant content from them? and i think for a time, dan did feel like he would want that. because that\u2019s fame, right?\u00a0\u2018and he would always always agree with him. this was the man\u2019s favorite\u2019 i know this is a commentary on like generally the culture of the internet but i have a feeling this is something dan would feel p hard. but i would imagine\u00a0\u2018i feel like i can tell you anything\u2019 is the part that would be the most gutting, bc he put so so much of himself out here for us. and i would also wonder how hard the abruptness of the ending would hit - the sudden\u00a0\u2018and then he died\u2019 after\u00a0\u2018man does not live by bread alone\u2019, the acknowledgement that dan couldn\u2019t just survive on his audience (and, more extensively, the internet), and how 1. he could still die lonely, had that been how he felt (i don\u2019t think he does, but diversifying oneself and one\u2019s relationships is emphasized here) and 2. the almost insignificance of an online presence, in objective terms, like. all that\u2019s left of this lonely person is his facebook. i think that ties in really strongly with dan\u2019s desire to leave something physical behind, like tabinof and dapgo and the ii dvd, something as physical evidence they existed and made an impact</p><p>inside your mind (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-inside-your-mind-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - so concept is just&hellip;seeing inside your partner\u2019s head? and like i feel like that\u2019s something dan would want, or care a lot about, in some sense. a bit violent, lyrically, but i wouldn\u2019t doubt that he cares (or, perhaps at a time in his past, cared) about it quite a lot some days. i think he just really cares about what other people think about him, probably especially phil, but also like the deep desire to understand someone? esp someone you love</p><p>it\u2019s not living (if it\u2019s not with you) (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-its-not-living-if-its-not-with-you-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - okay this one\u2019s very straight up about heroin addiction but i would definitely wonder if dan felt it like. in connection to phil in some ways? and i know the easy connection would be that dan wouldn\u2019t be able to stop thinking abt <i>phil</i>\u00a0and uwu it\u2019s not living if it\u2019s not with phil but the lyrics are actually quite dark? i would actually guess it had more to do with like. he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about phil and wanting to like. be openly <i>with</i>\u00a0phil (heyyy that authenticity yo) but also like. the repercussions of openly being in a mlm relationship on his life and his career at the time, and even now,\u00a0\u2018if i choose, then i lose\u2019 like if he picks being open, there may be consequences in his career (although, more and more lately i wonder if he doesn\u2019t care so much anymore), but ofc if he picks his career, he\u2019s suffering from this lack of authenticity that\u2019s haunted him for a while</p><p>i couldn\u2019t be more in love (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0DBNzdum7k\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - so the whole song is more about a relationship with an audience/fanbase, and like what would happen if people just stopped caring and how like. putting so much time and effort into their relationship w. an audience and like, what about the creator\u2019s feelings? i think dan would take that really seriously, like, we\u2019re all really nice most of the time but what if we stopped caring? and like how would that affect him, after having given us nine+ years of himself? the other thing it touches on is the idea of just relying on\u00a0\u2018all the things that i did right\u2019 ie depending on the things that made him popular, and i could see dan looking at that and wondering if he\u2019s relied on that in the past, maybe this past year has been his attempt to move forward, or maybe his year of less activity (in the form of dinof vids) has been him relying on the things that got him where he is in order to keep his fanbase - so then, does that let him expand more, do more of the things he wants instead of, oh, idk, giving the people what they want? or does he feel obligated to do <i>more </i>of what the people want, since that\u2019s what got him where he is?</p><p>i always wanna die (sometimes) (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBqgSiYCFHs\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - it\u2019s a <i>meme</i>\u00a0but generally like. existence is exhausting? and that\u2019s the whole idea? like god sometimes just doing stuff day to day is so so tiring, and i think that\u2019s something that resonates with dan? and there\u2019s a lot of other meaning about like death n stuff, and like. some days suck but you have to keep going? bc your life doesn\u2019t just affect you it affects everyone and maybe that\u2019s motivation for you maybe it isn\u2019t but you have to realize that giving up is also something that affects everyone. maybe that\u2019s something dan would see in relation to his depression and phil, and how resigning himself can really harm those around him as well</p><p><b>kay now the fun one</b></p><p>mine (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-mine-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this whole fucking thing is a testament to dnp i can\u2019t even fucking type correctly rn bc i\u2019m so passionate abt this okay. literally the opening and closing lines are\u00a0\u2018there comes a time in a young man&rsquo;s life / he should settle down and find himself a wife / but i&rsquo;m just fine cause i know that you are mine\u2019 like if you try to tell me for a single fucking second that\u2019s not dnp i will come to your house and make you listen to it on repeat until u understand okay. but like. that\u2019s their whole thing right? they\u2019re each other\u2019s and that\u2019s what matters? god i\u2019m gonna literally do this (almost) line by line:\u00a0\u2018i fight crime online sometimes\u2019 = dan\u2019s desire to be this positive force on the internet.\u00a0\u2018and write rhymes i hide behind\u2019 = oh dan\u2019s diss track hmmm (but more generally, he makes jokes that he hides his fear and <i>other things</i> behind).\u00a0\u2018i\u2019m fine if you are fine\u2019 = oh u cannot tell me that\u2019s not how dan feels? about phil? that he finds happiness in knowing phil\u2019s happy? and then of fucking course\u00a0\u2018looking back on 2009 / when people said that it was raining all the time / i see sunshine cause i know you are mine\u2019 oof that hits hard right in the feels okay dan definitely heard this and smiled his fucking face off cause u know in spite of whatever bullshit he had going on in 2009 he definitely still saw it as a bright spot in his life bc he met phil that\u2019s just the truth. what i\u2019m really interested in is the third verse\u00a0\u2018for some reason i just can\u2019t say\u00a0\u2018i do\u2019\u2019 like. would dan possibly feel that way? i have no idea. but at the very least, it\u2019s definitely something that dan would feel in some way, bc they\u2019re not open abt their relationship and a marriage would obviously make it Very open. ugh sorry this one just hits hard and like. just knowing dnp have each other in whatever sense that actually means it\u2019s like. physically painful in a good way. bless them</p>",

and i think for a time, dan did feel like he would want that. because that\u2019s fame, right?\u00a0\u2018and he would always always agree with him. this was the man\u2019s favorite\u2019 i know this is a commentary on like generally the culture of the internet but i have a feeling this is something dan would feel p hard. but i would imagine\u00a0\u2018i feel like i can tell you anything\u2019 is the part that would be the most gutting, bc he put so so much of himself out here for us. and i would also wonder how hard the abruptness of the ending would hit - the sudden\u00a0\u2018and then he died\u2019 after\u00a0\u2018man does not live by bread alone\u2019, the acknowledgement that dan couldn\u2019t just survive on his audience (and, more extensively, the internet), and how 1. he could still die lonely, had that been how he felt (i don\u2019t think he does, but diversifying oneself and one\u2019s relationships is emphasized here) and 2. the almost insignificance of an online presence, in objective terms, like. all that\u2019s left of this lonely person is his facebook. i think that ties in really strongly with dan\u2019s desire to leave something physical behind, like tabinof and dapgo and the ii dvd, something as physical evidence they existed and made an impact</p><p>inside your mind (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-inside-your-mind-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - so concept is just\u2026seeing inside your partner\u2019s head? and like i feel like that\u2019s something dan would want, or care a lot about, in some sense. a bit violent, lyrically, but i wouldn\u2019t doubt that he cares (or, perhaps at a time in his past, cared) about it quite a lot some days. i think he just really cares about what other people think about him, probably especially phil, but also like the deep desire to understand someone? esp someone you love</p><p>it\u2019s not living (if it\u2019s not with you) (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-its-not-living-if-its-not-with-you-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - okay this one\u2019s very straight up about heroin addiction but i would definitely wonder if dan felt it like. in connection to phil in some ways? and i know the easy connection would be that dan wouldn\u2019t be able to stop thinking abt <i>phil</i>\u00a0and uwu it\u2019s not living if it\u2019s not with phil but the lyrics are actually quite dark? i would actually guess it had more to do with like. he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about phil and wanting to like. be openly <i>with</i>\u00a0phil (heyyy that authenticity yo) but also like. the repercussions of openly being in a mlm relationship on his life and his career at the time, and even now,\u00a0\u2018if i choose, then i lose\u2019 like if he picks being open, there may be consequences in his career (although, more and more lately i wonder if he doesn\u2019t care so much anymore), but ofc if he picks his career, he\u2019s suffering from this lack of authenticity that\u2019s haunted him for a while</p><p>i couldn\u2019t be more in love (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0DBNzdum7k\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - so the whole song is more about a relationship with an audience/fanbase, and like what would happen if people just stopped caring and how like. putting so much time and effort into their relationship w. an audience and like, what about the creator\u2019s feelings? i think dan would take that really seriously, like, we\u2019re all really nice most of the time but what if we stopped caring? and like how would that affect him, after having given us nine+ years of himself? the other thing it touches on is the idea of just relying on\u00a0\u2018all the things that i did right\u2019 ie depending on the things that made him popular, and i could see dan looking at that and wondering if he\u2019s relied on that in the past, maybe this past year has been his attempt to move forward, or maybe his year of less activity (in the form of dinof vids) has been him relying on the things that got him where he is in order to keep his fanbase - so then, does that let him expand more, do more of the things he wants instead of, oh, idk, giving the people what they want? or does he feel obligated to do <i>more </i>of what the people want, since that\u2019s what got him where he is?</p><p>i always wanna die (sometimes) (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBqgSiYCFHs\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - it\u2019s a <i>meme</i>\u00a0but generally like. existence is exhausting? and that\u2019s the whole idea? like god sometimes just doing stuff day to day is so so tiring, and i think that\u2019s something that resonates with dan? and there\u2019s a lot of other meaning about like death n stuff, and like. some days suck but you have to keep going? bc your life doesn\u2019t just affect you it affects everyone and maybe that\u2019s motivation for you maybe it isn\u2019t but you have to realize that giving up is also something that affects everyone. maybe that\u2019s something dan would see in relation to his depression and phil, and how resigning himself can really harm those around him as well</p><p><b>kay now the fun one</b></p><p>mine (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-mine-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this whole fucking thing is a testament to dnp i can\u2019t even fucking type correctly rn bc i\u2019m so passionate abt this okay. literally the opening and closing lines are\u00a0\u2018there comes a time in a young man\u2019s life / he should settle down and find himself a wife / but i\u2019m just fine cause i know that you are mine\u2019 like if you try to tell me for a single fucking second that\u2019s not dnp i will come to your house and make you listen to it on repeat until u understand okay. but like. that\u2019s their whole thing right? they\u2019re each other\u2019s and that\u2019s what matters? god i\u2019m gonna literally do this (almost) line by line:\u00a0\u2018i fight crime online sometimes\u2019 = dan\u2019s desire to be this positive force on the internet.\u00a0\u2018and write rhymes i hide behind\u2019 = oh dan\u2019s diss track hmmm (but more generally, he makes jokes that he hides his fear and <i>other things</i> behind).\u00a0\u2018i\u2019m fine if you are fine\u2019 = oh u cannot tell me that\u2019s not how dan feels? about phil? that he finds happiness in knowing phil\u2019s happy? and then of fucking course\u00a0\u2018looking back on 2009 / when people said that it was raining all the time / i see sunshine cause i know you are mine\u2019 oof that hits hard right in the feels okay dan definitely heard this and smiled his fucking face off cause u know in spite of whatever bullshit he had going on in 2009 he definitely still saw it as a bright spot in his life bc he met phil that\u2019s just the truth. what i\u2019m really interested in is the third verse\u00a0\u2018for some reason i just can\u2019t say\u00a0\u2018i do\u2019\u2019 like. would dan possibly feel that way? i have no idea. but at the very least, it\u2019s definitely something that dan would feel in some way, bc they\u2019re not open abt their relationship and a marriage would obviously make it Very open. ugh sorry this one just hits hard and like. just knowing dnp have each other in whatever sense that actually means it\u2019s like. physically painful in a good way. bless them</p>",

embracing yourself? as a person? as whoever you truly are? and they keep coming back to the idea of authenticity with this whole album, and i think that\u2019s part of why dan would be so\u00a0\u2018attacked\u2019 by this album bc he\u2019s in the throes of his own search for authenticity</p><p>love it if we made it (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzWt3EUsqiw\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this one\u2019s fun bc it\u2019s basically all about how fucked up society is and like. all the things that\u2019ve gone wrong, how society is just so beyond messed up, and it\u2019s like. yes. all of this is so wrong, messed up, but there\u2019s hope? like we can be self-aware, we can make differences, and i would imagine dan listening to this and feeling like. maybe torn? because there are some things where he\u2019s trying to make a difference but some where he would want to but not know how? so y\u2019know personal attack on him in the sense that it\u2019s a personal attack on everyone - we\u2019re all complicit, in a way, and part of it is just because we <i>know</i>\u00a0all this is happening but how much do any of us try to enact change? i imagine that\u2019s something that keeps dan up at night, tbh. i mean the man spent an hour picking up snails off a sidewalk so they wouldn\u2019t get squished</p><p>be my mistake (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-be-my-mistake-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this one is interesting bc the artist explains it\u2019s really just about guilt, on a deeper level, and about not knowing what you want? ultimately even tho it\u2019s about like a hookup with someone you don\u2019t know that you really want, i think dan would take this more at the deep level of like. having no idea what he wants in life (something he\u2019s said before, multiple times) and? perhaps in a sense, going back to things that he knows don\u2019t actually represent what he wants (ie, that don\u2019t feel authentic) but knowing the outcome and maybe just feeling safe or at least feeling <i>something</i>\u00a0significant from them, maybe like he\u2019s fulfilling what other people want of him by doing these things even if they don\u2019t quite feel like <i>him</i></p><p>sincerity is scary (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r3KmwdOWVQ\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>,<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-sincerity-is-scary-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i think this is one of the ones dan would feel calls him out the most - it\u2019s all about a person\u2019s relationship with social media, authenticity, and self-perception over external perception? so like. the entire first verse is all about hiding behind a mask of irony and like. i think for dan that\u2019s a hard-hitting callout? and i don\u2019t just mean his whole brand of how <i>everything</i>\u00a0was done/said\u00a0\u2018ironically\u2019, more that even now he hides his fears behind jokes and such, bc that\u2019s a culturally relevant way to do things (\u2019you try and mask your pain in the most post-modern way\u2019). the whole idea is like. if you\u2019re being ironic, if you\u2019re masking everything behind jokes and insincerity, you can\u2019t <i>actually</i>\u00a0be judged the way you can if you\u2019re authentic and sincere? so like. there\u2019s dan\u2019s fear of judgment plastered all over this song, his fear of people looking at him for who he is and disliking it or perceiving it in a way he doesn\u2019t like (\u2019and why would you believe you could control how you\u2019re perceived when at your best you\u2019re intermediately versed in your own feelings\u2019) it\u2019s like. and he\u2019s said this a couple times now, but he doesn\u2019t always <i>know</i>\u00a0why he does/thinks certain things, there\u2019s not always a reasoning behind it, and i think that for him, that contributes to his struggles with authenticity. i think this is really doubly intriguing when ttlmt is taken into account as well?

about phil? that he finds happiness in knowing phil\u2019s happy? and then of fucking course\u00a0\u2018looking back on 2009 / when people said that it was raining all the time / i see sunshine cause i know you are mine\u2019 oof that hits hard right in the feels okay dan definitely heard this and smiled his fucking face off cause u know in spite of whatever bullshit he had going on in 2009 he definitely still saw it as a bright spot in his life bc he met phil that\u2019s just the truth. what i\u2019m really interested in is the third verse\u00a0\u2018for some reason i just can\u2019t say\u00a0\u2018i do\u2019\u2019 like. would dan possibly feel that way? i have no idea. but at the very least, it\u2019s definitely something that dan would feel in some way, bc they\u2019re not open abt their relationship and a marriage would obviously make it Very open. ugh sorry this one just hits hard and like. just knowing dnp have each other in whatever sense that actually means it\u2019s like. physically painful in a good way. bless them</p>",
                "content": "<p>hi b! for context (<a href=\"https://knlalla.tumblr.com/post/181882326882/dan-posts-about-the-1975s-new-album-and-says-me\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) okay i should clarify, i shouldn&rsquo;t have called them hcs as i think people take that with a lot of connotation to mean&nbsp;&lsquo;i actually think this happened/would happen&rsquo; when really it&rsquo;s more like&hellip;</p><p>okay. if i were to write a fic with dnp as characters who exist exactly as we see them (as in, we know everything abt their personalities, which irl we absolutely do not) then this is how i imagine the character of dan would see most of the songs on&nbsp;&lsquo;a brief inquiry into online relationships&rsquo; and why he would say that he feels&nbsp;&lsquo;personally attacked by literally every song on this album&rsquo; - <b>to be clear, i don&rsquo;t think this is <i>actually</i>&nbsp;what dan thinks!</b>&nbsp;please treat this as fiction!</p><p>bear with me bc i wanna talk abt some of the others first (i also wanted to include the links to the genius interviews where matt talks abt some of the meanings behind the songs, but it doesn&rsquo;t have all of them so check out the lyrics as well)</p><p>give yourself a try (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-give-yourself-a-try-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i mean obviously this is the one dan felt he related to most/felt most safe posting about how he related to it/was personally attacked by it, but the whole thing is like. being yourself, and like? embracing yourself? as a person? as whoever you truly are? and they keep coming back to the idea of authenticity with this whole album, and i think that&rsquo;s part of why dan would be so&nbsp;&lsquo;attacked&rsquo; by this album bc he&rsquo;s in the throes of his own search for authenticity</p><p>love it if we made it (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzWt3EUsqiw\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this one&rsquo;s fun bc it&rsquo;s basically all about how fucked up society is and like. all the things that&rsquo;ve gone wrong, how society is just so beyond messed up, and it&rsquo;s like. yes. all of this is so wrong, messed up, but there&rsquo;s hope? like we can be self-aware, we can make differences, and i would imagine dan listening to this and feeling like. maybe torn? because there are some things where he&rsquo;s trying to make a difference but some where he would want to but not know how? so y&rsquo;know personal attack on him in the sense that it&rsquo;s a personal attack on everyone - we&rsquo;re all complicit, in a way, and part of it is just because we <i>know</i>&nbsp;all this is happening but how much do any of us try to enact change? i imagine that&rsquo;s something that keeps dan up at night, tbh. i mean the man spent an hour picking up snails off a sidewalk so they wouldn&rsquo;t get squished</p><p>be my mistake (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-be-my-mistake-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this one is interesting bc the artist explains it&rsquo;s really just about guilt, on a deeper level, and about not knowing what you want? ultimately even tho it&rsquo;s about like a hookup with someone you don&rsquo;t know that you really want, i think dan would take this more at the deep level of like. having no idea what he wants in life (something he&rsquo;s said before, multiple times) and? perhaps in a sense, going back to things that he knows don&rsquo;t actually represent what he wants (ie, that don&rsquo;t feel authentic) but knowing the outcome and maybe just feeling safe or at least feeling <i>something</i>&nbsp;significant from them, maybe like he&rsquo;s fulfilling what other people want of him by doing these things even if they don&rsquo;t quite feel like <i>him</i></p><p>sincerity is scary (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r3KmwdOWVQ\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>,<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-sincerity-is-scary-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i think this is one of the ones dan would feel calls him out the most - it&rsquo;s all about a person&rsquo;s relationship with social media, authenticity, and self-perception over external perception? so like. the entire first verse is all about hiding behind a mask of irony and like. i think for dan that&rsquo;s a hard-hitting callout? and i don&rsquo;t just mean his whole brand of how <i>everything</i>&nbsp;was done/said&nbsp;&lsquo;ironically&rsquo;, more that even now he hides his fears behind jokes and such, bc that&rsquo;s a culturally relevant way to do things (&rsquo;you try and mask your pain in the most post-modern way&rsquo;). the whole idea is like. if you&rsquo;re being ironic, if you&rsquo;re masking everything behind jokes and insincerity, you can&rsquo;t <i>actually</i>&nbsp;be judged the way you can if you&rsquo;re authentic and sincere? so like. there&rsquo;s dan&rsquo;s fear of judgment plastered all over this song, his fear of people looking at him for who he is and disliking it or perceiving it in a way he doesn&rsquo;t like (&rsquo;and why would you believe you could control how you&rsquo;re perceived when at your best you&rsquo;re intermediately versed in your own feelings&rsquo;) it&rsquo;s like. and he&rsquo;s said this a couple times now, but he doesn&rsquo;t always <i>know</i>&nbsp;why he does/thinks certain things, there&rsquo;s not always a reasoning behind it, and i think that for him, that contributes to his struggles with authenticity. i think this is really doubly intriguing when ttlmt is taken into account as well? bc he specifically says that for &lsquo;some people&rsquo; (aka him i mean this is known at this point) unless they&rsquo;re being honest with themselves, they won&rsquo;t feel free. and i think that&rsquo;s like. dan&rsquo;s internal struggle right now/this past year: how to balance his evident need for authentic and honest self-expression with his deep-rooted fear of judgment of his authentic self. i mean read the damn title of the song, sincerity <i>is</i>&nbsp;scary</p><p>i like america &amp; america likes me (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-i-like-america-and-america-likes-me-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a deeper meaning to how dan would interpret it (aside from the obvious and intentional callout about guns in america) but all i can think about is talking about being on fire, being a liar,&nbsp;&lsquo;is that designer?&rsquo; etc, and the death of dinof. but also y&rsquo;know about calling out things that are Wrong&nbsp;</p><p>the man who married a robot / love theme (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-the-man-who-married-a-robot-love-theme-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - i think this one is maybe one that dan felt absolutely <i>viscerally</i>&nbsp;attacked by, this is a direct callout on his relationship with the internet and his audience. it&rsquo;s presented as a relationship, a friendship, a love, but like if you step back and go&nbsp;&lsquo;this is about a person and an audience&rsquo; it&rsquo;s so so much more heartbreaking. i mean the internet saying&nbsp;&lsquo;i love you very very much&hellip;i never ever want us to be apart ever again ever&rsquo; like that&rsquo;s us that&rsquo;s literally us we want constant content from them? and i think for a time, dan did feel like he would want that. because that&rsquo;s fame, right?&nbsp;&lsquo;and he would always always agree with him. this was the man&rsquo;s favorite&rsquo; i know this is a commentary on like generally the culture of the internet but i have a feeling this is something dan would feel p hard. but i would imagine&nbsp;&lsquo;i feel like i can tell you anything&rsquo; is the part that would be the most gutting, bc he put so so much of himself out here for us. and i would also wonder how hard the abruptness of the ending would hit - the sudden&nbsp;&lsquo;and then he died&rsquo; after&nbsp;&lsquo;man does not live by bread alone&rsquo;, the acknowledgement that dan couldn&rsquo;t just survive on his audience (and, more extensively, the internet), and how 1. he could still die lonely, had that been how he felt (i don&rsquo;t think he does, but diversifying oneself and one&rsquo;s relationships is emphasized here) and 2. the almost insignificance of an online presence, in objective terms, like. all that&rsquo;s left of this lonely person is his facebook. i think that ties in really strongly with dan&rsquo;s desire to leave something physical behind, like tabinof and dapgo and the ii dvd, something as physical evidence they existed and made an impact</p><p>inside your mind (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-inside-your-mind-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - so concept is just&hellip;seeing inside your partner&rsquo;s head? and like i feel like that&rsquo;s something dan would want, or care a lot about, in some sense. a bit violent, lyrically, but i wouldn&rsquo;t doubt that he cares (or, perhaps at a time in his past, cared) about it quite a lot some days. i think he just really cares about what other people think about him, probably especially phil, but also like the deep desire to understand someone? esp someone you love</p><p>it&rsquo;s not living (if it&rsquo;s not with you) (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-its-not-living-if-its-not-with-you-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - okay this one&rsquo;s very straight up about heroin addiction but i would definitely wonder if dan felt it like. in connection to phil in some ways? and i know the easy connection would be that dan wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stop thinking abt <i>phil</i>&nbsp;and uwu it&rsquo;s not living if it&rsquo;s not with phil but the lyrics are actually quite dark? i would actually guess it had more to do with like. he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about phil and wanting to like. be openly <i>with</i>&nbsp;phil (heyyy that authenticity yo) but also like. the repercussions of openly being in a mlm relationship on his life and his career at the time, and even now,&nbsp;&lsquo;if i choose, then i lose&rsquo; like if he picks being open, there may be consequences in his career (although, more and more lately i wonder if he doesn&rsquo;t care so much anymore), but ofc if he picks his career, he&rsquo;s suffering from this lack of authenticity that&rsquo;s haunted him for a while</p><p>i couldn&rsquo;t be more in love (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0DBNzdum7k\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - so the whole song is more about a relationship with an audience/fanbase, and like what would happen if people just stopped caring and how like. putting so much time and effort into their relationship w. an audience and like, what about the creator&rsquo;s feelings? i think dan would take that really seriously, like, we&rsquo;re all really nice most of the time but what if we stopped caring? and like how would that affect him, after having given us nine+ years of himself? the other thing it touches on is the idea of just relying on&nbsp;&lsquo;all the things that i did right&rsquo; ie depending on the things that made him popular, and i could see dan looking at that and wondering if he&rsquo;s relied on that in the past, maybe this past year has been his attempt to move forward, or maybe his year of less activity (in the form of dinof vids) has been him relying on the things that got him where he is in order to keep his fanbase - so then, does that let him expand more, do more of the things he wants instead of, oh, idk, giving the people what they want? or does he feel obligated to do <i>more </i>of what the people want, since that&rsquo;s what got him where he is?</p><p>i always wanna die (sometimes) (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBqgSiYCFHs\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - it&rsquo;s a <i>meme</i>&nbsp;but generally like. existence is exhausting? and that&rsquo;s the whole idea? like god sometimes just doing stuff day to day is so so tiring, and i think that&rsquo;s something that resonates with dan? and there&rsquo;s a lot of other meaning about like death n stuff, and like. some days suck but you have to keep going? bc your life doesn&rsquo;t just affect you it affects everyone and maybe that&rsquo;s motivation for you maybe it isn&rsquo;t but you have to realize that giving up is also something that affects everyone. maybe that&rsquo;s something dan would see in relation to his depression and phil, and how resigning himself can really harm those around him as well</p><p><b>kay now the fun one</b></p><p>mine (<a href=\"https://genius.com/The-1975-mine-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) - this whole fucking thing is a testament to dnp i can&rsquo;t even fucking type correctly rn bc i&rsquo;m so passionate abt this okay. literally the opening and closing lines are&nbsp;&lsquo;there comes a time in a young man&rsquo;s life / he should settle down and find himself a wife / but i&rsquo;m just fine cause i know that you are mine&rsquo; like if you try to tell me for a single fucking second that&rsquo;s not dnp i will come to your house and make you listen to it on repeat until u understand okay. but like. that&rsquo;s their whole thing right?
