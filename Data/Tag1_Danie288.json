He paced across the holding cell back and forth. This was all a big misunderstanding and he needed to get out of here, but so far no one had come to take his statement.</p><p>He groaned in frustration when finally, an officer walked up to the cell.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhilip Lester?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He ran up to the bars. <b><i>\u201cYes! That\u2019s me. You need to listen this is all a big misunderstanding; I don\u2019t deserve to be in here!\u201d</i></b></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Hey, backup, you!\u201d </b></i>the officer barked at him.</p><p>He took a step back. <i><b>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand\u2014I don\u2019t belong in here!\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say.\u201d </b></i>The officer chuckled at him.<i><b> \u201cNow turn around, hands up to the bars.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil did what he was asked and was soon being pushed into a small interrogation room. The cuffs where once again removed and he was being pushed down into the chair on the other side of the table. He was alone for only a moment before Officer Temple and another officer stepped into the room.</p><p><b><i>\u201cLuke, you have to believe me, this is a big mistake.\u201d </i></b>he started.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWho do you think you are, son? You address the officer by his last name.</i></b>\u201d the unnamed officer spat at him.</p><p>Phil looked at Luke, who just gave him a look of pity.</p><p>They interrogated Phil Lester for hours, and through the whole thing, his story never changed. He stated that he had been forced by his captor to carve words into the skin of Mr. Howell. He also was very adamant that he had no involvement in Mr. Howell\u2019s kidnapping. Honestly, Luke had been at this a very long time and he had no doubt of Phil\u2019s innocence, but his partner, on the other hand, seemed dead set that Phil was guilty and needed to be locked away forever.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo, Anthony what do you think of Phil\u2019s statement?\u201d</i></b> \u00a0Luke cautiously questioned him.</p><p>Anthony chuckled. <i><b>\u201cThat fag is guilty as hell. He will fit right along with those other scumbags in prison.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He seemed like he was telling the truth to me.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Anthony glared at him. \u201d<i><b>Well, it really isn\u2019t up to you to decide he is innocent, now is it, Temple?\u201d</b></i> he jeered at him.</p><p>Not wanting to upset his partner any further, he didn\u2019t say anything else merely shook his head.</p><p>He escorted Phil back to the holding cell.<i><b> \u201cListen, Phil, I believe your story, but there isn\u2019t anything I can do. They are officially charging you in Dan\u2019s kidnapping, torture, and rape. They will send someone to come get you soon to transfer you to jail while you await trial.\u201d</b></i></p><p>He noticed tears in Phils eyes.<b><i> \u201cThank\u2019s, Luke, it really means a lot that you believe me. Do you think there is any way I can see Dan?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He shook his head, <i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Since your being charged with the kidnapping there is no way they will let you see him before trial. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</b></i></p><p>He locked Phil back in the cell and headed back to his desk. One the little tv in the corner of the room a news story caught his eye.</p><p><i>\u201cIt has been reported that Youtube star Phil Lester\u2014also known as Amazingphil\u2014has been arrested earlier this afternoon in the connection in his boyfriend&rsquo;s kidnapping. It is unknown exactly what he is saying, but there have been reports that he is claiming to be innocent. But it seems Lester\u2019s alone presence has been missed and is still going strong, as when the news first broke of Mr. Lester\u2019s arrest, the hashtag #SetPhilLesterFree began trending on the social media site, Twitter. It is also being reported that some fans have started a Gofundme page in hopes of raising money for bail, although it has been stated by police that the chances of Mr. Lester receiving the option for bail is unlikely.&ldquo;</i></p><p>Luke shook his head\u2014this was out of control. He had been working on this case since the beginning, and he had never seen anything like it before. Hopefully, when Dan gives his statement for trial this mess can be sorted out. But in the meantime, he was going to try his hardest to prove Phil Lester\u2019s innocence. \u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>It had been a week since Dan had regressed again, and also a week since Lela had been notified Phil had been arrested. She hated that she had to report him, but with the way Dan had been acting at the last visit, begging to be hurt, she had no choice.</p><p>They had been working on trying to get Dan to regress back to his normal state, but so far that hasn\u2019t worked. He\u2019s spending most of his time either crying and begging for Phil, or playing with Eric and Kate. Lela smiled, she wasn\u2019t either of Eric or Kate&rsquo;s doctors, but she was so proud of them for stepping up and helping Dan in every way they could. They talked to him when he was inconsolable, and they generally tried to make him as happy as he could be.</p><p>From what the nurses told her, Dan\u2019s scars were healing up finely, although they did say it might leave some permanent scarring.</p><p>While it wasn\u2019t easy to talk to Dan in this state, she had officially diagnosed him with major depressive disorder, PTSD, and mental regression. From what she knows, Dan started off as a little and went into his headspace every now and again. But after he was taken it must have manifested into full-on mental regression. While he couldn\u2019t control going into his headspace per se, he had more control than he does now.

He paced across the holding cell back and forth. This was all a big misunderstanding and he needed to get out of here, but so far no one had come to take his statement.</p><p>He groaned in frustration when finally, an officer walked up to the cell.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhilip Lester?\u201d</b></i></p><p>He ran up to the bars. <b><i>\u201cYes! That\u2019s me.

The cuffs where once again removed and he was being pushed down into the chair on the other side of the table. He was alone for only a moment before Officer Temple and another officer stepped into the room.</p><p><b><i>\u201cLuke, you have to believe me, this is a big mistake.\u201d </i></b>he started.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWho do you think you are, son? You address the officer by his last name.</i></b>\u201d the unnamed officer spat at him.</p><p>Phil looked at Luke, who just gave him a look of pity.</p><p>They interrogated Phil Lester for hours, and through the whole thing, his story never changed. He stated that he had been forced by his captor to carve words into the skin of Mr. Howell. He also was very adamant that he had no involvement in Mr. Howell\u2019s kidnapping. Honestly, Luke had been at this a very long time and he had no doubt of Phil\u2019s innocence, but his partner, on the other hand, seemed dead set that Phil was guilty and needed to be locked away forever.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSo, Anthony what do you think of Phil\u2019s statement?\u201d</i></b> \u00a0Luke cautiously questioned him.</p><p>Anthony chuckled. <i><b>\u201cThat fag is guilty as hell. He will fit right along with those other scumbags in prison.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know.

They are officially charging you in Dan\u2019s kidnapping, torture, and rape. They will send someone to come get you soon to transfer you to jail while you await trial.\u201d</b></i></p><p>He noticed tears in Phils eyes.<b><i> \u201cThank\u2019s, Luke, it really means a lot that you believe me. Do you think there is any way I can see Dan?\u201d</i></b></p><p>He shook his head, <i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Since your being charged with the kidnapping there is no way they will let you see him before trial. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</b></i></p><p>He locked Phil back in the cell and headed back to his desk. One the little tv in the corner of the room a news story caught his eye.</p><p><i>\u201cIt has been reported that Youtube star Phil Lester\u2014also known as Amazingphil\u2014has been arrested earlier this afternoon in the connection in his boyfriend\u2019s kidnapping. It is unknown exactly what he is saying, but there have been reports that he is claiming to be innocent. But it seems Lester\u2019s alone presence has been missed and is still going strong, as when the news first broke of Mr. Lester\u2019s arrest, the hashtag #SetPhilLesterFree began trending on the social media site, Twitter. It is also being reported that some fans have started a Gofundme page in hopes of raising money for bail, although it has been stated by police that the chances of Mr. Lester receiving the option for bail is unlikely.\u201c</i></p><p>Luke shook his head\u2014this was out of control. He had been working on this case since the beginning, and he had never seen anything like it before. Hopefully, when Dan gives his statement for trial this mess can be sorted out. But in the meantime, he was going to try his hardest to prove Phil Lester\u2019s innocence. \u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>It had been a week since Dan had regressed again, and also a week since Lela had been notified Phil had been arrested. She hated that she had to report him, but with the way Dan had been acting at the last visit, begging to be hurt, she had no choice.</p><p>They had been working on trying to get Dan to regress back to his normal state, but so far that hasn\u2019t worked. He\u2019s spending most of his time either crying and begging for Phil, or playing with Eric and Kate. Lela smiled, she wasn\u2019t either of Eric or Kate\u2019s doctors, but she was so proud of them for stepping up and helping Dan in every way they could. They talked to him when he was inconsolable, and they generally tried to make him as happy as he could be.</p><p>From what the nurses told her, Dan\u2019s scars were healing up finely, although they did say it might leave some permanent scarring.</p><p>While it wasn\u2019t easy to talk to Dan in this state, she had officially diagnosed him with major depressive disorder, PTSD, and mental regression. From what she knows, Dan started off as a little and went into his headspace every now and again. But after he was taken it must have manifested into full-on mental regression. While he couldn\u2019t control going into his headspace per se, he had more control than he does now. The mental regression was brought on by the trauma he suffered, and he now has no control over it whatsoever.</p><p>It broke her heart. Overall this time she had really come to care about him and seeing him like this was distressing.</p><p>Lela sighed. And on top of everything, she had just been informed that Phil\u2019s trial would be starting soon and Dan would have to testify. There was no way of knowing what he would say or how it would affect him.</p><p>Well, I better go check on Dan, she thought.

He paced across the holding cell back and forth. This was all a big misunderstanding and he needed to get out of here, but so far no one had come to take his statement.</p><p>He groaned in frustration when finally, an officer walked up to the cell.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Philip Lester?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He ran up to the bars. <b><i>&ldquo;Yes! That&rsquo;s me. You need to listen this is all a big misunderstanding; I don&rsquo;t deserve to be in here!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Hey, backup, you!&rdquo; </b></i>the officer barked at him.</p><p>He took a step back. <i><b>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;I don&rsquo;t belong in here!&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they all say.&rdquo; </b></i>The officer chuckled at him.<i><b> &ldquo;Now turn around, hands up to the bars.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil did what he was asked and was soon being pushed into a small interrogation room. The cuffs where once again removed and he was being pushed down into the chair on the other side of the table. He was alone for only a moment before Officer Temple and another officer stepped into the room.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Luke, you have to believe me, this is a big mistake.&rdquo; </i></b>he started.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Who do you think you are, son? You address the officer by his last name.</i></b>&rdquo; the unnamed officer spat at him.</p><p>Phil looked at Luke, who just gave him a look of pity.</p><p>They interrogated Phil Lester for hours, and through the whole thing, his story never changed. He stated that he had been forced by his captor to carve words into the skin of Mr. Howell. He also was very adamant that he had no involvement in Mr. Howell&rsquo;s kidnapping. Honestly, Luke had been at this a very long time and he had no doubt of Phil&rsquo;s innocence, but his partner, on the other hand, seemed dead set that Phil was guilty and needed to be locked away forever.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;So, Anthony what do you think of Phil&rsquo;s statement?&rdquo;</i></b> &nbsp;Luke cautiously questioned him.</p><p>Anthony chuckled. <i><b>&ldquo;That fag is guilty as hell. He will fit right along with those other scumbags in prison.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He seemed like he was telling the truth to me.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Anthony glared at him. &rdquo;<i><b>Well, it really isn&rsquo;t up to you to decide he is innocent, now is it, Temple?&rdquo;</b></i> he jeered at him.</p><p>Not wanting to upset his partner any further, he didn&rsquo;t say anything else merely shook his head.</p><p>He escorted Phil back to the holding cell.<i><b> &ldquo;Listen, Phil, I believe your story, but there isn&rsquo;t anything I can do. They are officially charging you in Dan&rsquo;s kidnapping, torture, and rape. They will send someone to come get you soon to transfer you to jail while you await trial.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He noticed tears in Phils eyes.<b><i> &ldquo;Thank&rsquo;s, Luke, it really means a lot that you believe me. Do you think there is any way I can see Dan?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He shook his head, <i><b>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Since your being charged with the kidnapping there is no way they will let you see him before trial. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He locked Phil back in the cell and headed back to his desk. One the little tv in the corner of the room a news story caught his eye.</p><p><i>&ldquo;It has been reported that Youtube star Phil Lester&mdash;also known as Amazingphil&mdash;has been arrested earlier this afternoon in the connection in his boyfriend&rsquo;s kidnapping.
