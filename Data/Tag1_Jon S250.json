She had grown up along side the crown princes Ned and Aemon, and the crown princess Lyanna. Born in the Red Keep, there hadn&rsquo;t been a day that she wasn&rsquo;t involved in the comings and goings of the royal family in one way or another. In truth, they had been as much her family as her mother and father were. Queen Daenerys was like a second mother to her, providing Litse with all of the extravagances that the crown princess Lyanna was accustomed to. Her mother, Missandei, was not only Queen Daenerys\u2019 handmaiden and trusted advisor, but her oldest and dearest friend.\u00a0</p><p>Her conception and birth was thought by most to have been an impossibility, and the result of blood magic. But in truth, it had been due in large part to the medical expertise of Maester Samewell Tarly. When the Unsullied were cut, Sam had come to discover, the masters had taken the pillars but not the stones, thinking that in doing so, they deprived the soldiers of pleasure, while allowing them to maintain their masculinity and drive to fight. At the insistence of Queen Daenerys, Maester Samwell had worked tirelessly on perfecting a procedure that would allow Missandei to conceive and carry a child that was the flesh and blood of both her and Grey Worm. And in the end, he had done just that. The likes of Litse\u2019s conception were unheard of, and would likely never be possible for anyone again.\u00a0</p><p>Litse knew some of what had happened to the Unsullied soldiers. Her mother tried to shield her from most of it, but she had heard mention of the atrocities that her father and the other soldiers had faced before Queen Daenerys had freed them.\u00a0It made her weep to think of it. Her father was a quiet man, and the most gentle man when it came to Litse and Missandei. To think that he had been through such torture caused Litse great sorrow.</p><p>The crown princess Lyanna had never felt the need to beg her mother for a sister, saying that she already had one in Litse. And it was said that Litse was one of the few people who was able to bring a true smile to Prince Ned\u2019s face. Litse\u00a0was close with all of Jon and Daenerys\u2019 children, but most of all with Aemon. Being as close in age as they were, they had been best friends from the time that they were very small. Their mothers had been pregnant together, and Litse was born only a moon after prince Aemon.\u00a0</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t known exactly when her feelings for Aemon began to change, but she knew that they had. She imagined that her growing affections had been the result of many things that occurred over the course of their friendship. Aemons gentle nature and quick sense of humour. His love for his people and his family alike. His beautiful voice that Litse found herself thinking about when Aemon wasn&rsquo;t around. Yes, she imagined that her feelings for Aemon had deepened as a result of all of those things, and many others. He was her very best friend, the person she went to when she had something to share, whether happy or sad. In truth, she loved Aemon. She was <i>in love </i>with Aemon. But she was an unworthy match for him. She had known this for as long as she had known anything. Those words were never said to her, of course, but she saw the pointed glares of the Nobel men and women when she and Aemon would walk the castle gardens together, and she heard the whispers and the sneers when the two of them would frolic on the beaches of Blackwater Bay. So it came as no surprise when it was announced that Prince Aemon would marry Amalie Ashford, a highborn lady whose family hailed from the Reach. She had kept herself composed when she had heard it, though her throat had tightened and her eyes had stung, she did not let on that her heart was breaking. She cried herself to sleep that night, her breath ragged, her cheeks hot and wet with tears. The next morning she composed herself, and chided herself for being so foolish. Aemon was a Prince, and the son of the King and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. As deep as her feelings for Aemon ran, she was certain that he did not feel the same for her. That was until he cornered her as she left her room that morning. His face had been desperate, a mixture of worry and despair.\u00a0\u201cI won&rsquo;t marry the Ashford girl.\u201d He had said. Litse had looked at him, unsure of what to say in response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou must.\u201d She finally said, her eyes boring into Aemons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t. I\u2019m not in love with her.\u201d Aemon had not taken his eyes off of Litse as he poured his heart out to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat should that matter?\u201d She said, not understanding why Aemon didn&rsquo;t seem to grasp the notion of an arranged marriage.\u00a0\u201cLove is not necessary to make such alliances.\u201d<br/></p><p>Aemon stared at her, a look of confusion crossing his face.\u00a0\u201cI don&rsquo;t want to marry for alliances.\u201d He said matter of factly. He was quiet for a moment before he spoke again.\u00a0\u201cI want to marry for love.\u201d Litse looked at him, this man who she had known since he was a boy, and she wanted to wrap her arms around him and never let him go. She wanted to press her lips to his, and tell him how desperately she loved him. She wanted to tell him that she didn&rsquo;t want him to marry the Ashford girl either. But instead of doing all of those things, she remained quiet, her eyes fixed on Aemon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have known love. True love. And I will not settle for anything less than that.\u201d Aemon said, a confident smile spreading across his face. Litse felt her heart jump as she looked into his eyes. Aemon stepped towards her a pace, his hands moving to clasp her smaller ones in his.\u00a0\u201cSurely you must know, Litse. It is you that I love. It has always been you.\u201d Litse looked up at him, her heart pounding, her cheeks burning, and for a moment she was unsure if she had heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cM.. me?\u201d She said, unable to hide the shock that filled her voice.\u00a0\u201cYou love&hellip; me?\u201d Aemon\u2019s smile widened as she spoke, but he did not answer her straight away. Instead he moved to rest his forehead against hers. Litse could feel his warm breath on her face, and she closed her eyes as she breathed him in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere is no one else for me.\u201d Aemon said.\u00a0\u201cOnly you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>There had been a loud discussion between Aemon and his parents after he told them that he did not intend to marry the Ashford girl. He had not minced his words when he told them where and with whom his affections lay. His mother had been the most difficult to convince, although, it had hardly been a battle with her. She was upset to be certain. The most powerful alliances were made through marriage. His mother knew that, his father knew that, and Aemon knew as well. And although Aemon had never been one to shirk his duties, he drew the line when it came to love. He saw the way his parents looked at one another. The way they loved each other. And he wanted that. He knew that he could have that. But he knew that he would only ever have it if he was able to be with Litse.\u00a0</p><p>His parents had relented, of course, knowing that a marriage without love is one of the greatest tragedies a person can endure.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Aemon and Litse wed one another in the Throne Room, with their families looking on. There had been sneers and judgmental glances from the Nobility, but Litse didn&rsquo;t care. She had dealt with it all her life. Aemon leaned close to her during the ceremony to whisper in her ear.\u00a0\u201cFuck them.\u201d He had said, a wicked smile playing on his face, and Litse had to stifle a laugh.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful woman in all of the Seven Kingdoms. Their jealousy is obvious, and their opinions are inconsequential.\u201d Litse watched him as he spoke, and she could tell that the thought of her being hurt in any way pained him. She clasped his hands tighter then, a smile spreading across her face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Aemon.\u201d She said.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled and moved to stand closer to her as he spoke,\u00a0\u201cAnd I, you.\u201d</p>",

She had grown up along side the crown princes Ned and Aemon, and the crown princess Lyanna. Born in the Red Keep, there hadn\u2019t been a day that she wasn\u2019t involved in the comings and goings of the royal family in one way or another. In truth, they had been as much her family as her mother and father were. Queen Daenerys was like a second mother to her, providing Litse with all of the extravagances that the crown princess Lyanna was accustomed to. Her mother, Missandei, was not only Queen Daenerys\u2019 handmaiden and trusted advisor, but her oldest and dearest friend.\u00a0</p><p>Her conception and birth was thought by most to have been an impossibility, and the result of blood magic. But in truth, it had been due in large part to the medical expertise of Maester Samewell Tarly. When the Unsullied were cut, Sam had come to discover, the masters had taken the pillars but not the stones, thinking that in doing so, they deprived the soldiers of pleasure, while allowing them to maintain their masculinity and drive to fight. At the insistence of Queen Daenerys, Maester Samwell had worked tirelessly on perfecting a procedure that would allow Missandei to conceive and carry a child that was the flesh and blood of both her and Grey Worm. And in the end, he had done just that. The likes of Litse\u2019s conception were unheard of, and would likely never be possible for anyone again.\u00a0</p><p>Litse knew some of what had happened to the Unsullied soldiers. Her mother tried to shield her from most of it, but she had heard mention of the atrocities that her father and the other soldiers had faced before Queen Daenerys had freed them.\u00a0It made her weep to think of it. Her father was a quiet man, and the most gentle man when it came to Litse and Missandei. To think that he had been through such torture caused Litse great sorrow.</p><p>The crown princess Lyanna had never felt the need to beg her mother for a sister, saying that she already had one in Litse. And it was said that Litse was one of the few people who was able to bring a true smile to Prince Ned\u2019s face. Litse\u00a0was close with all of Jon and Daenerys\u2019 children, but most of all with Aemon. Being as close in age as they were, they had been best friends from the time that they were very small. Their mothers had been pregnant together, and Litse was born only a moon after prince Aemon.\u00a0</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known exactly when her feelings for Aemon began to change, but she knew that they had. She imagined that her growing affections had been the result of many things that occurred over the course of their friendship. Aemons gentle nature and quick sense of humour. His love for his people and his family alike. His beautiful voice that Litse found herself thinking about when Aemon wasn\u2019t around. Yes, she imagined that her feelings for Aemon had deepened as a result of all of those things, and many others. He was her very best friend, the person she went to when she had something to share, whether happy or sad. In truth, she loved Aemon. She was <i>in love </i>with Aemon. But she was an unworthy match for him. She had known this for as long as she had known anything. Those words were never said to her, of course, but she saw the pointed glares of the Nobel men and women when she and Aemon would walk the castle gardens together, and she heard the whispers and the sneers when the two of them would frolic on the beaches of Blackwater Bay. So it came as no surprise when it was announced that Prince Aemon would marry Amalie Ashford, a highborn lady whose family hailed from the Reach. She had kept herself composed when she had heard it, though her throat had tightened and her eyes had stung, she did not let on that her heart was breaking. She cried herself to sleep that night, her breath ragged, her cheeks hot and wet with tears. The next morning she composed herself, and chided herself for being so foolish. Aemon was a Prince, and the son of the King and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. As deep as her feelings for Aemon ran, she was certain that he did not feel the same for her. That was until he cornered her as she left her room that morning. His face had been desperate, a mixture of worry and despair.\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t marry the Ashford girl.\u201d He had said. Litse had looked at him, unsure of what to say in response.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou must.\u201d She finally said, her eyes boring into Aemons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I\u2019m not in love with her.\u201d Aemon had not taken his eyes off of Litse as he poured his heart out to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat should that matter?\u201d She said, not understanding why Aemon didn\u2019t seem to grasp the notion of an arranged marriage.\u00a0\u201cLove is not necessary to make such alliances.\u201d<br></p><p>Aemon stared at her, a look of confusion crossing his face.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry for alliances.\u201d He said matter of factly. He was quiet for a moment before he spoke again.\u00a0\u201cI want to marry for love.\u201d Litse looked at him, this man who she had known since he was a boy, and she wanted to wrap her arms around him and never let him go. She wanted to press her lips to his, and tell him how desperately she loved him. She wanted to tell him that she didn\u2019t want him to marry the Ashford girl either. But instead of doing all of those things, she remained quiet, her eyes fixed on Aemon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have known love. True love. And I will not settle for anything less than that.\u201d Aemon said, a confident smile spreading across his face. Litse felt her heart jump as she looked into his eyes. Aemon stepped towards her a pace, his hands moving to clasp her smaller ones in his.\u00a0\u201cSurely you must know, Litse. It is you that I love. It has always been you.\u201d Litse looked up at him, her heart pounding, her cheeks burning, and for a moment she was unsure if she had heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cM.. me?\u201d She said, unable to hide the shock that filled her voice.\u00a0\u201cYou love\u2026 me?\u201d Aemon\u2019s smile widened as she spoke, but he did not answer her straight away. Instead he moved to rest his forehead against hers. Litse could feel his warm breath on her face, and she closed her eyes as she breathed him in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere is no one else for me.\u201d Aemon said.\u00a0\u201cOnly you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>There had been a loud discussion between Aemon and his parents after he told them that he did not intend to marry the Ashford girl. He had not minced his words when he told them where and with whom his affections lay. His mother had been the most difficult to convince, although, it had hardly been a battle with her. She was upset to be certain. The most powerful alliances were made through marriage. His mother knew that, his father knew that, and Aemon knew as well. And although Aemon had never been one to shirk his duties, he drew the line when it came to love. He saw the way his parents looked at one another. The way they loved each other. And he wanted that. He knew that he could have that. But he knew that he would only ever have it if he was able to be with Litse.\u00a0</p><p>His parents had relented, of course, knowing that a marriage without love is one of the greatest tragedies a person can endure.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Aemon and Litse wed one another in the Throne Room, with their families looking on. There had been sneers and judgmental glances from the Nobility, but Litse didn\u2019t care. She had dealt with it all her life. Aemon leaned close to her during the ceremony to whisper in her ear.\u00a0\u201cFuck them.\u201d He had said, a wicked smile playing on his face, and Litse had to stifle a laugh.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful woman in all of the Seven Kingdoms. Their jealousy is obvious, and their opinions are inconsequential.\u201d Litse watched him as he spoke, and she could tell that the thought of her being hurt in any way pained him. She clasped his hands tighter then, a smile spreading across her face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you, Aemon.\u201d She said.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled and moved to stand closer to her as he spoke,\u00a0\u201cAnd I, you.\u201d</p>",
