It is hinted at in the books, that he first wanted to recruit Euron and only fell on Bran as a last resort and because Bran was approachable when he was in a coma after his fall. I do think bookwise Bran will have to seperate himself from Bloodraven whose agenda might even be to gain immortality or prolonging of life by warging into Jon. This is not yet a full theory but rather a hunch. Bloodraven in the books makes me uncomfortable and he seems to be a magic-user who uses people for his own purposes, and that is also the characteristic of a tyrant\u2026. I don\u2019t trust him, not at all. <br/></p><p>Apart from that, Bran has come a long way, and I am sure, that he will choose the right side, the sight of the living, and if he has to warg into a White Walker or the Night King I think there will be a good reason behind that. I\u2019m not particularly fond of any of these ideas, but I must admit that I have not yet developped a full fledged theory on Bran\u2019s endgame. My headcanon is that he wargs into the dragons, flys them to all the places of magic of the CotF, destroys the magic of the children, which makes the WW drop down and then ensures that the dragons are dead as well. But that is not really a theory, it is an outcome I would like (which is not the same as a theory, as many people in this fandom seem to forget!)</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p>",
