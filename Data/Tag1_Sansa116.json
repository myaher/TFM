It\u2019s completely ridiculous that he had to mention it this much, but people ignore these interviews and choose to dismiss her because they refused to see her as anything but an unimportant side character who was going to betray her family. She isn\u2019t, not anymore and it\u2019s way past time for people to simply accept that because soon it\u2019s going to be a time for wolves, and that means it will be Sansa\u2019s time as well (where she will make a huge contribution to the future of the continent like the main character she is) and that\u2019s that on that.</p>",
