Sat beside him, was a towering white wolf with crimson eyes, but despite its sheer size, it still looked quite young, like an overgrown puppy. </p><p>\u201cNo bastards allowed,\u201d you said bitterly and solemnly. \u201cQueen Cersei\u2019s orders.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk ill of your aunt,\u201d Jon told you with a slight titter; it was then that he reached behind him, and brought out a small flask. He offered it to you. \u201cHere, drink this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You asked curiously. </p><p>\u201cWine,\u201d he replied, chuckling with surprise when you snatched the flask and took a big gulp. </p><p>\u201cThank the gods\u2026\u201d you huffed out, wiping your lips and passing his flask back. \u201cSorry, I just\u2026 I needed a drink\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he shrugged with a hum. \u201cI take it you\u2019re not a big fan of the Queen, then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely the fuck not!\u201d You scoffed. \u201cMy aunt hates me, and I hate her just as much\u2026 vile woman.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019d never expect to hear from a Lannister,\u201d Jon laughed softly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Lannister,\u201d you growled gently. \u201cJaime Lannister may be my father, but I\u2019ll never wear the lion upon my armour\u2026 you seem decent, Jon, which is why I don\u2019t want to snap, so can we stop talking about how we\u2019re little more than bastards, please?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said sincerely, his hand coming to rest upon your knee sweetly. \u201cSay, how about I give you a tour of Winterfell?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d you agreed, leaning over and kissing his cheek sweetly; when you pulled back, his cheeks were flushed with pink, and you couldn\u2019t help but to bite your lip and smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p></p>",

Arya&rsquo;d&nbsp;been left to guard Cersei and her son for a time, Casterly Rock, the castle that Jon was already within, searching for his baby sister, her screams driving him, as he felled soldiers who stood in his way, ignored Lannister soldiers that moved out of his way. Only Tommen then stood, a boy hardened by the death of his sister, and for what reason Jon could not yet tell, raised his sword to Jon. Jon did not wish to strike the boy, but he would to get to Arya.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out of my way,&rdquo; He near snarled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You won't&nbsp;have the wolf girl,&rdquo; Tommen replied, raising his chin high.&nbsp;&ldquo;I promised her nothing would happen.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;JON!&rdquo; She screeched again, hands fisting in bloodied tunic, crying as wave after wave of pain tore through her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t help you, girl, you know who he&rsquo;s sided with,&rdquo; Cersei Lannister&rsquo;s words are harsh, but Arya fears they may be true, as she lays in her bed of blood. The former queen had been kind enough to help tend her, but Arya could not tell if she truly cared if she died or not, pain ripping through as she sobbed and sweat, dropping as her eyes rolled back into her head.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Breathe! Before you kill the both of you!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><hr /><p>Though Tommen thought he mayhaps had been protecting Jon&rsquo;s sister, he had kept him from her, even as she screamed for him. The boy had made to stop Jon, and though he was wont to do it, the youngest Lannister&rsquo;s blood now stained The White Wolf&rsquo;s sword, barging his way through the halls, hearing the footfalls of The Hound and Tormund behind him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Arya!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; He barrelled his shoulder through the door, greeted with the sight of Arya, sickly pale, in a bed of blood, and he was quick to her side, sword dropped in his haste. He pushed sweat soaked locks from her face, but she was pushing at him, gripping him by clothes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Promise me, Jon, Promise me you will protect him!&rdquo; Jon shakes his head, frowning as he does not understand until the cries of a babe pierce his ears, and he&rsquo;s turning his head, spying Cersei Lannister, holding clothed but bloody babe within her arms, soothing him.
