He wanted to get out of this interaction with at least some of his dignity after all. \u201cSince the time of the Luxon,\u201d he said, gently pushing aside Caleb\u2019s fingers, letting them linger a little more than necessary, so that he could flip back through the book to a set of notes on the history of the school. \u201cThe light imbued us with knowledge far greater than any before. Our god gave us the power to hold fate and future and past in our hands and mold them to our will.\u201d Caleb looked up to meet his eyes and Essik smirked suggestively. \u201cAnd I, for one, am very good with my hands.\u201d</p><p>Caleb blinked and, for a moment, Essik thought maybe he was finally realizing his intentions. Caleb shut the book and sat it down in his chair as he got to his feet. \u201cThat reminds me of something I read the other day, let me get your opinion on this\u2026\u201d</p><p>Essik sighed and sagged back in the chair, letting his arms flop to his sides.

He hadn\u2019t even heard her come in, but there she was, leaning against the wall and smirking at him insufferably, a single pierced eyebrow raised teasingly. He cleared his throat and quickly sat up straight, folding his legs together and sitting his clasped hands in his lap. He could tell from her face that it was too late. Someone, at least, had figured out his intentions and it was the last person he would have wished.</p><p>\u201cCaleb,\u201d the monk, he forgot her name, called.</p><p>The wizard glanced at her briefly before turning back to the shelves. \u201cJa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNott wanted your help with something. Something about some kind of device she found in the courtyard?\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned and started towards the door. \u201cExcuse me, Essik, I should see what this is about.\u201d</p><p>When they were alone, they sat in silence for a few minutes before it got to be too much. He knew that she wanted to say something. \u201cSo, how are you settling in?\u201d he asked kindly, betraying nothing on his face. She didn\u2019t answer, just stared at him. He wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d been trained but he knew an interrogation method when he saw one. She has letting him stew in the awkwardness, letting the silence fester until he revealed something, anything, just to make it stop. He cleared his throat again and shifted in his chair, resolving not to answer anything she asked him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it personally,\u201d she said, surprising him.</p><p>He looked over at her and tilted his head in confusion. \u201cTake\u2026 what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb. He\u2019s bad at social cues.

Can I just give you some general advice, then? It\u2019s nothing to do with seducing him or anything, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Essik hesitated, gritting his teeth painfully. \u201cI\u2026 suppose\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, come bearing books. Doesn\u2019t have to be important books, if you have some old tales from your culture you\u2019re alright with sharing, or, like, something history related? That\u2019ll do it. He doesn\u2019t like touching, you\u2019re gonna wanna work up to that.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look at her, choosing instead to flip through his spell book like he was looking for something particular. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked, his voice bored and detached. </p><p>\u201cYeah, just one question.

Are you, Gods forbid, serious about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when you do, you\u2019re gonna wanna be as clear as possible. Trust me, if there is any ambiguity he will error on the side of caution and assume you\u2019re plotting to kill him.\u201d</p><p>The door opened then and Caleb stepped back inside. He glared at her but she shrugged, unaffected. \u201cNott didn\u2019t ask for me, she wasn\u2019t even in the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and pushed off the wall, slipping through the open door. \u201cOops?\u201d she said, unconvincingly, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>Caleb sighed and moved back over to sit beside Essik, picking up the spell book. \u201cSorry about that. She\u2019s\u2026 Beau,\u201d he said, waving his hand uselessly.</p><p>Beau, right, that was her name. </p><p>Essik gave Caleb a kind smile. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble. We had a lovely conversation.\u201d</p><p>Caleb blinked at him. \u201cYou had a lovely conversation\u2026 with Beau?\u201d He seemed suspicious but turned back to the book. \u201cYou\u2019d be one of the first.\u201d It seemed like a good natured ribbing instead of an actual insult. When he\u2019d first met these people he thought them to be just the run-of-the-mill mercenary types, but they were clearly closer than that. They were similar to a Din in and of themselves, a family they made on their own, with no actual blood relations.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was\u2026 odd but enlightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe usually is. Shall we move on to the second spell?\u201d</p><p>Essik smiled and reclined back leisurely in his chair, one arm across the back behind Caleb. \u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201d</p>",
