And Bren sees a way to a new name, a new life and a chance at happiness.</p><p>-</p><p>An AU based on the story of Kvothe&rsquo;s parents from The Kingkiller Chronicles</p><hr><p>For Bren, life had become all about small acts of rebellion.</p><p>They could never be much, he had to conserve what little bravery he had, sheltering it in cupped hands like an anaemic flame wavering and flickering dangerously at every breeze. But every so often it would flare and skip, a strengthening heartbeat, and Bren would slide the change from an errand run up his sleeve rather than turning it over with the goods he\u2019d been sent to buy or he would borrow a book from the city library he knew wouldn\u2019t be approved of, tucking it in his coat, feeling its edges press against his chest like a stab of thrilling guilt as the rest of his selection were turned over and inspected and approved of when he got home. Sometimes it was even as small as waiting until the last possible second to begin his chores, letting his thoughts wander, letting the day be his for as long as he could before he had to remember that his life wasn\u2019t his own. </p><p>And sometimes, when he was passing the door to Father\u2019s office and heard, for the first time in years, an unfamiliar voice, he would stop in his tracks and listen. </p><p>A small act of rebellion. Never seen, never thought of, never acknowledged by anyone but him, spent sparingly like a last clipped copper penny. But as long as he still had those to give, there was something to live for. </p><p>So Bren stopped and he listened. </p><p>He knew every single person in the small borough of Rexxantrum that Father was in charge of. He knew the bakers and butchers and grocers who would come to plead that they couldn\u2019t pay the taxes and leave more unhappy than they came, he knew the crownsguard and constables who gave him bribes, he knew the other archmagi with their sonorous voices and quivering hands. </p><p>But this voice was new. It was rich and smooth and full of life, it was like music. The more Bren heard of it, the more eagerly he pressed his ear to the crack in the heavy oak door, like a plant aching towards sunlight. </p><p>\u201cWe are a registered troupe, Mr Trent, I can assure you of that,\u201d the voice said, confident and sprightly, like everything was an amusing joke, \u201cNot one ounce of trouble in the five years I\u2019ve been in charge.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cBe that as it may, we are a different people in Rexxantrum,\u201d Father\u2019s voice was low and gravelly, instantly making Bren\u2019s heart kick with fear as he recognised the subtle signs of anger, the signs he\u2019d been trained to hear and respond to, to do whatever he could to make them go away.</p><p>But the voice didn\u2019t know the signs. It bulled on. </p><p>\u201cMy circus is for all people, Mr Ikithon. All people crave a little excitement every now and then, a little break from their hard working lives. In exchange for a pitch in the main square and ninety percent of the show intake, your folk can have a night of magic and frivolity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking and debauchery, you mean,\u201d Father\u2019s voice was a whip, smacking down the other and outside the door, Bren flinched, \u201cAnd please do not call what you do <i>magic</i>. What I do is magic. You are speaking to one of the archmages of the Cerberus Assembly, sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am fully aware of that. And you can call me Mr Tealeaf. Or Mollymauk, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>Bren\u2019s heart crashed to the floor. Couldn\u2019t the man hear the danger in Father\u2019s voice? Didn\u2019t he realise he had to back away and do it quickly, beg forgiveness? </p><p>\u201cBe grateful I am deigning to refer to you as sir at all,\u201d the reply was chilly, the end of every word bitten off, \u201cYour circus may go elsewhere. We have no place for your kind in Rexxantrum.\u201d </p><p>There was a long pause. Bren knew he should turn and walk away as fast as he could, move on and forget what he\u2019d heard, go on with his day. Father would be furious if he saw how little work he\u2019d done that morning and what he\u2019d do if he found him listening at the door didn\u2019t even bear thinking about. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t. So he was there to hear the soft chuckle and scrape of a chair as Mr Tealeaf drew back and replied, still bright as summer grass though there was an edge to his words that hadn\u2019t been there before.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Ikithon. I\u2019ll be sure to write to Baron de Rolo and ask him to take your fair city off the rotation.\u201d</p><p>This new pause was shorter though heavier, weighing like a ton of lead. </p><p>\u201cBaron de Rolo?\u201d Father sounded like he was about to explode. Though Bren was no longer afraid. This mysterious stranger had an unseen shield. </p><p>\u201cOur patron,\u201d the smile was obvious in his voice, \u201cThough its more his lovely wife who funds our pursuits, she\u2019ll be most upset to hear we\u2019ve been barred from the capital of the Empire. The lady Vex\u2019halia, of course you must know her, seeing as you\u2019re an archmage and all. Our writ of performance is right here, affixed with the seal of Whitestone\u2026\u201d a rustle of fabric and paper, \u201c\u2026as you would have known if you\u2019d asked to see it. It\u2019s the law to do that for all travelling performance troupes, just so you know.\u201d </p><p>This pause was all iron, a bitter taste in the mouth. </p><p>\u201cOne night,\u201d Father practically snarled, \u201cThat is all. Then you leave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all we ever asked.\u201d </p><p>Bren started as he heard Father\u2019s chair scrape across the carpet. The spell broken, he he straightened so fast there was a stab of dizziness in the base of his skull and his heart lurched like it was getting left behind, barrelling to the end of the corridor and making himself look very busy pulling some books off of the hall bookcase, hoping it wasn\u2019t visible at this distance that it was a completely random assortment, not some volumes to help him write his latest essay. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t help his eyes sliding to the opening office door. Father was the first to step out, always in his ceremonial robes, face long and lined and hard. The man who followed was so different, so out of place here in the town house that it was like two completely different artists with completely different sensibilities had been forced to share the same canvas. He was fabulously dressed, in a long coat of plush, plum velvet that forked at the end and whose dagged sleeves revealed long arms decorated in ink and gilded metal; high waisted trousers in the same colour scheme with a split pattern, stripes on one side and diamonds on the other and long boots of supple, soft black leather. Under his arm was a hat, tall and proud, a true showman\u2019s hat. Though quite how it was going to fit over horns that size, Bren had no idea. </p><p>A tiefling. An honest to goodness tiefling, here in Rexxantrum.</p><p>No wonder Father had a face the colour of a storm cloud ready to burst. </p><p>With a smile that said he fully understood the affect he was having on the archmage and was enjoying it intensely, the tielfing swished a long purple tail and swept the hat onto his head with a grand gesture, revealing the fact it had two cleverly concealed holes for his horns. </p><p>\u201cYou should come to the show, Mr Ikithon,\u201d he flashed a set of sharply pointed incisors, reaching into a cavernous sleeve to pull out a piece of gold paper, holding it out to Father, \u201cGive yourself a night off. See what the Fletching and Moondrop Travelling Carnival of Curiosities has to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Father said stiffly, pointedly taking the ticket and immediately letting it fall to the carpet, as if it had never been between his long, white fingers. He made no move to retrieve it. Neither did Mr Tealeaf.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, sir,\u201d the tielfing smiled and started down the stairs, \u201cWe\u2019ll cause not a spot of trouble, you\u2019ll see.\u201d </p><p>Though in that moment, as he turned, his eyes- drop cut rubies with no pupils- rested lightly on Bren, there at the end of the corridor. Immediately, he felt his cheeks go red, which Father always snapped at him to control as it looked ridiculous with his auburn hair and made his freckles stand out. But the tielfing didn\u2019t snap or look vaguely disgusted. He just smiled and winked, swift and careless, before disappearing down the stairs in a swirl of velvet. </p><p>Struck silent, Bren watched with his mouth slightly open, stirrings in the pit of his stomach. </p><p>\u201cBren Aldric Ermendrud.\u201d</p><p>Father\u2019s voice was sharp and dangerous and it rushed at Bren with a horrible, sickening certainly that he was about to face the weight of all the built up fury and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. </p><p>\u201cClose your mouth, boy,\u201d Father snapped, striding down the corridor until he was bearing down upon him. Even though Bren was twenty five and had grown taller than Father ever would, he still managed to make him feel an inch off the ground by sheer force of will. </p><p>\u201cYou look like a fool,\u201d he knocked the books from Bren\u2019s arms with a hard, sharp shove, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, standing here gawking when you should be working?\u201d</p><p>Bren stared down at his feet, biting his lip hard, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father.\u201d</p><p>There was a long, horrible moment of silence as Bren looked at the scattered books, lying there like limp, dead birds and prayed Father couldn\u2019t read his thoughts, couldn\u2019t see those stirrings inside him. </p><p>Maybe even if he couldn\u2019t see them, he could sense the shadows of them, for he snarled, \u201cIf I hear of you having anything to do with those deviant circus folk, I will punish you more severely than you have ever known. Am I clear, Bren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he managed to choke out, fear making his voice frail and shaky though he knew that was the desired effect. </p><p>Though his hands seemed aged, they moved faster than lightning, tightening around Bren\u2019s chin like a vice and jerking it upwards so he couldn\u2019t help but stare into those red tinged eyes. </p><p>\u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes <i>Father.\u201d</i></p><p>After Father had turned back into his office and slammed the door shut, leaving only his harsh command to pick up those books ringing in Bren\u2019s ears, he stayed still for a while, eyes closed, , shaky fingers pressed to his neck, counting his heart beats. If he got to ten, he would be okay. He just had to get to ten. </p><p>Ten heartbeats came and went and Bren could breathe once more. He started to gather up the books, straightening any bent pages, brushing dust from the covers. He let the simple task inflate until it took up every ounce of space in his head, focused utterly on it, allowed no other thoughts inside. </p><p>That was the best way to survive. </p><p>But then a glint of gold caught his eye. The ticket Mr Tealeaf left had become caught in the fringes of the hall carpet, looking a little forlorn, like a butterfly who\u2019d forgotten how to fly. A few steps brought Bren close enough to read the embossed printing on its surface.</p><p><i>The Fletching and Moondrop Travelling Carnival of Curiosities. Admit One. All are welcome!</i></p><p>Before he knew what he was really doing, the ticket was in his hand. Then it was in his pocket. </p><p>More thoughts pressed in on him and he fended them off as best he could, drowning them out by reading the titles of each book aloud, carefully ordering them by author then by colour, shifting them around on the shelf. </p><p>All the while the ticket stayed in his pocket, feeling far heavier than a little piece of foiled paper should. </p><p>\u201cStraighten your shoulders, boy. Your feet need to be planted firmly on the ground, how many times do I have to tell you?\u201d</p><p>Bren shifted his stance in accordance with Father\u2019s barked instructions, though he\u2019d always felt more comfortable on the balls of his feet where he could change direction more easily. </p><p>The ground was cold and hard underneath him, the air chilled. But they had to practise in the basement, there were far too many expensive, important things to break in the rest of the manor. </p><p>Magic was dangerous, Father had always drilled that into him before all else. It was only permitted within tight boundaries, under strict rules, compartmentalised and categorised and controlled. Using it carelessly, without understanding, that was for carnival hucksters and hedge wizards, people made to squeeze pennies out of ignorant country folk. </p><p>People like Mr Tealeaf, Bren supposed, thinking guiltily of the ticket still in the pocket of his trousers, neatly folded with the rest of his work clothes up in his room. </p><p>As he\u2019d dressed for practice, into the loose half trousers and shirt that left him free for movement, Bren made a decision. He\u2019d tear up the ticket as soon as he could, throw the pieces out of his window. Already he was working on three different knots of stress, each one a different scenario where Father discovered he had the ticket and none of them ended well. The risk simply wasn\u2019t worth it. Small acts of rebellion were one thing but outright foolishness was another. </p><p>But he\u2019d already been late for practice and hadn\u2019t had the time yet. But he would destroy it. He would. </p><p>\u201cWe will focus on Evocation spells today,\u201d Father announced, pacing at the other end of the cavernous basement, \u201cYour last essay on that particular subject was poor. Let\u2019s see if something a little more direct will help you see sense.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes Father,\u201d Bren nodded, holding his hands ready in front of him, mind already flickering through the motions necessary for the main spells he knew. </p><p>\u201cNow, I want to see some improvement from our last spar,\u201d Father continued, taking no note of how ready his charge was, how he had dropped into the right stance without needing to be asked, \u201cThe last time you were slow to react. It made you clumsy, there was no elegance to it. And-\u201c</p><p>His last words were lost to a roar as a burst of fire erupted from his hands and flew towards Bren, straight and furious as a thrown dagger. Bren yelped, all his readiness evaporating as the fire engulfed him, burning where it touched, scorching his skin an angry red before disappearing as its energy ran out. </p><p>Raw and tingling, nerves frayed and stinging with the injustice of it, Bren lost his composure, \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready! You gave me no warning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither will your enemies, boy,\u201d Father replied simply, letting loose another plume in his direction.</p><p>This time Bren dodged, rolling, skin screaming where the rough stone floor scraped against it. As soon as he could, he countered with a thunderclap, making it reverberate through the floor so even if it hit, it would do no more than throw Father off balance. But he couldn\u2019t even manage that. Father simply stilled the vibrations with a blast of his own, the exact frequency to fizzle it out into nothing. And then it was the horrific screeching energy of an eldritch blast, the one that made Bren\u2019s ears ring. Somehow he managed to throw himself underneath it, cowering until it past. </p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Father\u2019s voice cut through the screeching as it bounced around the space, \u201cClumsy. Sloppy.\u201d </p><p>Bren covered his face, breathing heavy. It was so unfair. Father did everything he could to break him apart, to knock him back. For him, sparring wasn\u2019t about learning, it was about punishment. Bren didn\u2019t feel like a student, he felt like a punching bag. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t <i>fair.</i></p><p>In that instant, all the anger, all the fear, all the emptiness years of it had hollowed out inside him was filled with something Bren couldn\u2019t name. In the crackling, ozone stinking wake of their spells, he stood, held out his hands and let that something fly from him as he spoke a word he couldn\u2019t recall afterwards. Not the simple spheres that had been thrown before, a sheer wall of flame erupted in the space, roaring its fury as soon as it appeared. For a moment, Father was awash in a bright orange glow. </p><p>And he looked terrified. </p><p>Bren wavered, uncertainty flooding back into him as the wall exploded out of existence. While the heat washed over him, not even leaving a lingering heat, it struck Father full in the chest, making him stagger and fall back with a cry of pain. Bren cried out with him. </p><p>The dungeon was filled with a smoke that reeked of sulphur, hanging heavily in the hair like clumps of fine gossamer. When Father stood, his clothes were singed, his hair was in disarray and there was an angry red mark lancing across his face. </p><p>Bren was already at the door, scrabbling at the handle, when Father caught him by the collar and dragged him back. </p><p>Though he knew it would only make it worse, at the unbridled fury in Father\u2019s eyes, he desperately babbled out, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>The backhand hit him harder than any spell, knocking his head against the wall. </p><p>As the pain rang through him, a less sensible part of him cried out, \u201cI don\u2019t understand! You want me to be a powerful wizard, why do you hurt me every time I beat you-\u201c</p><p>A force lifted him and pinned him to the wall, forcing his jaw shut. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Father rasped, still smoking slightly, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare utter those words. You are nothing, do you hear me? You are garbage. You are worthless. I am doing everything I can to nurture the miniscule scrap of talent you have and you should be grateful I am wasting my time on a pathetic boy like you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Bren nodded frantically, wincing as the press continued, achingly slow but relentless, caught between the implacable force and the cold stone wall. </p><p>And then it was gone. He fell to the floor, wheezing and crying, only able to nod over and over and pray it would be enough.</p><p>\u201cClean yourself up. There will be no dinner for you tonight,\u201d Father snapped, turning and marching away. </p><p>Bren was still crying as he staggered to his room, lurching for his bed like it was his last island of safety. He pressed his face to the pillows to muffle the sound, knowing Father would be disgusted to hear it, and gave himself over to the storm inside him. </p><p>He knew he\u2019d just performed a fantastic piece of magic, far above anything he\u2019d done before, but there was no joy in it. Just a bitter ashy taste. </p><p>All he\u2019d ever wanted was to be as strong a wizard as he could be, learn everything, read every book, find a safety and security in magic he\u2019d never found anywhere else. But it was never going to make Father proud of him. It was never going to make the sharp words, the slaps, the strikes hurt any less. </p><p>Bren had never wanted to be somewhere else, someone else so much in his entire life. </p><p>That was when, for the second time in the same day, a glint of gold caught his eye.</p><p>The ticket was jutting out of the pocket of Bren\u2019s abandoned trousers, like it was trying to wriggle to freedom. He could still read half of it, upside down but still, black niello letters etched into the gold. </p><p><i>All are welcome!</i></p><p>Bren tucked the ticket into his latest banned book, slipped it into his ratty old coat, the one Father didn\u2019t let him wear. He swung it around himself, hood up, tucking his distinctive red hair into his scarf. Everyone in the district knew Archmage Ikithon\u2019s red haired ward.</p><p>The night air was cold, reproachful, as he opened his window. But Bren didn\u2019t stop, he didn\u2019t even pause, he had to move before Father stopped stewing in his anger and put up the wards around his room to stop him going to get food. Out there was music and light and colour, out there was the furthest thing from in here that there could possibly be. </p><p>Out there was Mr Tealeaf, who\u2019d looked at him and smiled kindly.</p><p>That\u2019s what he needed right now. So that\u2019s where he went. </p>",

Sometimes it was even as small as waiting until the last possible second to begin his chores, letting his thoughts wander, letting the day be his for as long as he could before he had to remember that his life wasn\u2019t his own. </p><p>And sometimes, when he was passing the door to Father\u2019s office and heard, for the first time in years, an unfamiliar voice, he would stop in his tracks and listen. </p><p>A small act of rebellion. Never seen, never thought of, never acknowledged by anyone but him, spent sparingly like a last clipped copper penny. But as long as he still had those to give, there was something to live for. </p><p>So Bren stopped and he listened. </p><p>He knew every single person in the small borough of Rexxantrum that Father was in charge of. He knew the bakers and butchers and grocers who would come to plead that they couldn\u2019t pay the taxes and leave more unhappy than they came, he knew the crownsguard and constables who gave him bribes, he knew the other archmagi with their sonorous voices and quivering hands. </p><p>But this voice was new. It was rich and smooth and full of life, it was like music. The more Bren heard of it, the more eagerly he pressed his ear to the crack in the heavy oak door, like a plant aching towards sunlight. </p><p>\u201cWe are a registered troupe, Mr Trent, I can assure you of that,\u201d the voice said, confident and sprightly, like everything was an amusing joke, \u201cNot one ounce of trouble in the five years I\u2019ve been in charge.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cBe that as it may, we are a different people in Rexxantrum,\u201d Father\u2019s voice was low and gravelly, instantly making Bren\u2019s heart kick with fear as he recognised the subtle signs of anger, the signs he\u2019d been trained to hear and respond to, to do whatever he could to make them go away.</p><p>But the voice didn\u2019t know the signs. It bulled on. </p><p>\u201cMy circus is for all people, Mr Ikithon. All people crave a little excitement every now and then, a little break from their hard working lives. In exchange for a pitch in the main square and ninety percent of the show intake, your folk can have a night of magic and frivolity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking and debauchery, you mean,\u201d Father\u2019s voice was a whip, smacking down the other and outside the door, Bren flinched, \u201cAnd please do not call what you do <i>magic</i>. What I do is magic. You are speaking to one of the archmages of the Cerberus Assembly, sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am fully aware of that. And you can call me Mr Tealeaf. Or Mollymauk, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>Bren\u2019s heart crashed to the floor. Couldn\u2019t the man hear the danger in Father\u2019s voice? Didn\u2019t he realise he had to back away and do it quickly, beg forgiveness? </p><p>\u201cBe grateful I am deigning to refer to you as sir at all,\u201d the reply was chilly, the end of every word bitten off, \u201cYour circus may go elsewhere. We have no place for your kind in Rexxantrum.\u201d </p><p>There was a long pause. Bren knew he should turn and walk away as fast as he could, move on and forget what he\u2019d heard, go on with his day. Father would be furious if he saw how little work he\u2019d done that morning and what he\u2019d do if he found him listening at the door didn\u2019t even bear thinking about. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t. So he was there to hear the soft chuckle and scrape of a chair as Mr Tealeaf drew back and replied, still bright as summer grass though there was an edge to his words that hadn\u2019t been there before.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Ikithon. I\u2019ll be sure to write to Baron de Rolo and ask him to take your fair city off the rotation.\u201d</p><p>This new pause was shorter though heavier, weighing like a ton of lead. </p><p>\u201cBaron de Rolo?\u201d Father sounded like he was about to explode. Though Bren was no longer afraid. This mysterious stranger had an unseen shield. </p><p>\u201cOur patron,\u201d the smile was obvious in his voice, \u201cThough its more his lovely wife who funds our pursuits, she\u2019ll be most upset to hear we\u2019ve been barred from the capital of the Empire. The lady Vex\u2019halia, of course you must know her, seeing as you\u2019re an archmage and all. Our writ of performance is right here, affixed with the seal of Whitestone\u2026\u201d a rustle of fabric and paper, \u201c\u2026as you would have known if you\u2019d asked to see it. It\u2019s the law to do that for all travelling performance troupes, just so you know.\u201d </p><p>This pause was all iron, a bitter taste in the mouth. </p><p>\u201cOne night,\u201d Father practically snarled, \u201cThat is all. Then you leave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all we ever asked.\u201d </p><p>Bren started as he heard Father\u2019s chair scrape across the carpet. The spell broken, he he straightened so fast there was a stab of dizziness in the base of his skull and his heart lurched like it was getting left behind, barrelling to the end of the corridor and making himself look very busy pulling some books off of the hall bookcase, hoping it wasn\u2019t visible at this distance that it was a completely random assortment, not some volumes to help him write his latest essay. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t help his eyes sliding to the opening office door. Father was the first to step out, always in his ceremonial robes, face long and lined and hard. The man who followed was so different, so out of place here in the town house that it was like two completely different artists with completely different sensibilities had been forced to share the same canvas. He was fabulously dressed, in a long coat of plush, plum velvet that forked at the end and whose dagged sleeves revealed long arms decorated in ink and gilded metal; high waisted trousers in the same colour scheme with a split pattern, stripes on one side and diamonds on the other and long boots of supple, soft black leather. Under his arm was a hat, tall and proud, a true showman\u2019s hat. Though quite how it was going to fit over horns that size, Bren had no idea. </p><p>A tiefling. An honest to goodness tiefling, here in Rexxantrum.</p><p>No wonder Father had a face the colour of a storm cloud ready to burst. </p><p>With a smile that said he fully understood the affect he was having on the archmage and was enjoying it intensely, the tielfing swished a long purple tail and swept the hat onto his head with a grand gesture, revealing the fact it had two cleverly concealed holes for his horns. </p><p>\u201cYou should come to the show, Mr Ikithon,\u201d he flashed a set of sharply pointed incisors, reaching into a cavernous sleeve to pull out a piece of gold paper, holding it out to Father, \u201cGive yourself a night off. See what the Fletching and Moondrop Travelling Carnival of Curiosities has to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Father said stiffly, pointedly taking the ticket and immediately letting it fall to the carpet, as if it had never been between his long, white fingers. He made no move to retrieve it. Neither did Mr Tealeaf.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, sir,\u201d the tielfing smiled and started down the stairs, \u201cWe\u2019ll cause not a spot of trouble, you\u2019ll see.\u201d </p><p>Though in that moment, as he turned, his eyes- drop cut rubies with no pupils- rested lightly on Bren, there at the end of the corridor. Immediately, he felt his cheeks go red, which Father always snapped at him to control as it looked ridiculous with his auburn hair and made his freckles stand out. But the tielfing didn\u2019t snap or look vaguely disgusted. He just smiled and winked, swift and careless, before disappearing down the stairs in a swirl of velvet. </p><p>Struck silent, Bren watched with his mouth slightly open, stirrings in the pit of his stomach. </p><p>\u201cBren Aldric Ermendrud.\u201d</p><p>Father\u2019s voice was sharp and dangerous and it rushed at Bren with a horrible, sickening certainly that he was about to face the weight of all the built up fury and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. </p><p>\u201cClose your mouth, boy,\u201d Father snapped, striding down the corridor until he was bearing down upon him. Even though Bren was twenty five and had grown taller than Father ever would, he still managed to make him feel an inch off the ground by sheer force of will. </p><p>\u201cYou look like a fool,\u201d he knocked the books from Bren\u2019s arms with a hard, sharp shove, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, standing here gawking when you should be working?\u201d</p><p>Bren stared down at his feet, biting his lip hard, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father.\u201d</p><p>There was a long, horrible moment of silence as Bren looked at the scattered books, lying there like limp, dead birds and prayed Father couldn\u2019t read his thoughts, couldn\u2019t see those stirrings inside him. </p><p>Maybe even if he couldn\u2019t see them, he could sense the shadows of them, for he snarled, \u201cIf I hear of you having anything to do with those deviant circus folk, I will punish you more severely than you have ever known. Am I clear, Bren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he managed to choke out, fear making his voice frail and shaky though he knew that was the desired effect. </p><p>Though his hands seemed aged, they moved faster than lightning, tightening around Bren\u2019s chin like a vice and jerking it upwards so he couldn\u2019t help but stare into those red tinged eyes. </p><p>\u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes <i>Father.\u201d</i></p><p>After Father had turned back into his office and slammed the door shut, leaving only his harsh command to pick up those books ringing in Bren\u2019s ears, he stayed still for a while, eyes closed, , shaky fingers pressed to his neck, counting his heart beats. If he got to ten, he would be okay. He just had to get to ten. </p><p>Ten heartbeats came and went and Bren could breathe once more. He started to gather up the books, straightening any bent pages, brushing dust from the covers. He let the simple task inflate until it took up every ounce of space in his head, focused utterly on it, allowed no other thoughts inside. </p><p>That was the best way to survive. </p><p>But then a glint of gold caught his eye. The ticket Mr Tealeaf left had become caught in the fringes of the hall carpet, looking a little forlorn, like a butterfly who\u2019d forgotten how to fly. A few steps brought Bren close enough to read the embossed printing on its surface.</p><p><i>The Fletching and Moondrop Travelling Carnival of Curiosities. Admit One. All are welcome!</i></p><p>Before he knew what he was really doing, the ticket was in his hand. Then it was in his pocket. </p><p>More thoughts pressed in on him and he fended them off as best he could, drowning them out by reading the titles of each book aloud, carefully ordering them by author then by colour, shifting them around on the shelf. </p><p>All the while the ticket stayed in his pocket, feeling far heavier than a little piece of foiled paper should. </p><p>\u201cStraighten your shoulders, boy. Your feet need to be planted firmly on the ground, how many times do I have to tell you?\u201d</p><p>Bren shifted his stance in accordance with Father\u2019s barked instructions, though he\u2019d always felt more comfortable on the balls of his feet where he could change direction more easily. </p><p>The ground was cold and hard underneath him, the air chilled. But they had to practise in the basement, there were far too many expensive, important things to break in the rest of the manor. </p><p>Magic was dangerous, Father had always drilled that into him before all else. It was only permitted within tight boundaries, under strict rules, compartmentalised and categorised and controlled. Using it carelessly, without understanding, that was for carnival hucksters and hedge wizards, people made to squeeze pennies out of ignorant country folk. </p><p>People like Mr Tealeaf, Bren supposed, thinking guiltily of the ticket still in the pocket of his trousers, neatly folded with the rest of his work clothes up in his room. </p><p>As he\u2019d dressed for practice, into the loose half trousers and shirt that left him free for movement, Bren made a decision. He\u2019d tear up the ticket as soon as he could, throw the pieces out of his window. Already he was working on three different knots of stress, each one a different scenario where Father discovered he had the ticket and none of them ended well. The risk simply wasn\u2019t worth it. Small acts of rebellion were one thing but outright foolishness was another. </p><p>But he\u2019d already been late for practice and hadn\u2019t had the time yet. But he would destroy it. He would. </p><p>\u201cWe will focus on Evocation spells today,\u201d Father announced, pacing at the other end of the cavernous basement, \u201cYour last essay on that particular subject was poor. Let\u2019s see if something a little more direct will help you see sense.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes Father,\u201d Bren nodded, holding his hands ready in front of him, mind already flickering through the motions necessary for the main spells he knew. </p><p>\u201cNow, I want to see some improvement from our last spar,\u201d Father continued, taking no note of how ready his charge was, how he had dropped into the right stance without needing to be asked, \u201cThe last time you were slow to react. It made you clumsy, there was no elegance to it. And-\u201c</p><p>His last words were lost to a roar as a burst of fire erupted from his hands and flew towards Bren, straight and furious as a thrown dagger. Bren yelped, all his readiness evaporating as the fire engulfed him, burning where it touched, scorching his skin an angry red before disappearing as its energy ran out. </p><p>Raw and tingling, nerves frayed and stinging with the injustice of it, Bren lost his composure, \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready! You gave me no warning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither will your enemies, boy,\u201d Father replied simply, letting loose another plume in his direction.</p><p>This time Bren dodged, rolling, skin screaming where the rough stone floor scraped against it. As soon as he could, he countered with a thunderclap, making it reverberate through the floor so even if it hit, it would do no more than throw Father off balance. But he couldn\u2019t even manage that. Father simply stilled the vibrations with a blast of his own, the exact frequency to fizzle it out into nothing. And then it was the horrific screeching energy of an eldritch blast, the one that made Bren\u2019s ears ring. Somehow he managed to throw himself underneath it, cowering until it past. </p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Father\u2019s voice cut through the screeching as it bounced around the space, \u201cClumsy. Sloppy.\u201d </p><p>Bren covered his face, breathing heavy. It was so unfair. Father did everything he could to break him apart, to knock him back. For him, sparring wasn\u2019t about learning, it was about punishment. Bren didn\u2019t feel like a student, he felt like a punching bag. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t <i>fair.</i></p><p>In that instant, all the anger, all the fear, all the emptiness years of it had hollowed out inside him was filled with something Bren couldn\u2019t name. In the crackling, ozone stinking wake of their spells, he stood, held out his hands and let that something fly from him as he spoke a word he couldn\u2019t recall afterwards. Not the simple spheres that had been thrown before, a sheer wall of flame erupted in the space, roaring its fury as soon as it appeared. For a moment, Father was awash in a bright orange glow. </p><p>And he looked terrified. </p><p>Bren wavered, uncertainty flooding back into him as the wall exploded out of existence. While the heat washed over him, not even leaving a lingering heat, it struck Father full in the chest, making him stagger and fall back with a cry of pain. Bren cried out with him. </p><p>The dungeon was filled with a smoke that reeked of sulphur, hanging heavily in the hair like clumps of fine gossamer. When Father stood, his clothes were singed, his hair was in disarray and there was an angry red mark lancing across his face. </p><p>Bren was already at the door, scrabbling at the handle, when Father caught him by the collar and dragged him back. </p><p>Though he knew it would only make it worse, at the unbridled fury in Father\u2019s eyes, he desperately babbled out, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>The backhand hit him harder than any spell, knocking his head against the wall. </p><p>As the pain rang through him, a less sensible part of him cried out, \u201cI don\u2019t understand! You want me to be a powerful wizard, why do you hurt me every time I beat you-\u201c</p><p>A force lifted him and pinned him to the wall, forcing his jaw shut. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Father rasped, still smoking slightly, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare utter those words. You are nothing, do you hear me? You are garbage. You are worthless. I am doing everything I can to nurture the miniscule scrap of talent you have and you should be grateful I am wasting my time on a pathetic boy like you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Bren nodded frantically, wincing as the press continued, achingly slow but relentless, caught between the implacable force and the cold stone wall. </p><p>And then it was gone. He fell to the floor, wheezing and crying, only able to nod over and over and pray it would be enough.</p><p>\u201cClean yourself up. There will be no dinner for you tonight,\u201d Father snapped, turning and marching away. </p><p>Bren was still crying as he staggered to his room, lurching for his bed like it was his last island of safety. He pressed his face to the pillows to muffle the sound, knowing Father would be disgusted to hear it, and gave himself over to the storm inside him. </p><p>He knew he\u2019d just performed a fantastic piece of magic, far above anything he\u2019d done before, but there was no joy in it. Just a bitter ashy taste. </p><p>All he\u2019d ever wanted was to be as strong a wizard as he could be, learn everything, read every book, find a safety and security in magic he\u2019d never found anywhere else. But it was never going to make Father proud of him. It was never going to make the sharp words, the slaps, the strikes hurt any less. </p><p>Bren had never wanted to be somewhere else, someone else so much in his entire life. </p><p>That was when, for the second time in the same day, a glint of gold caught his eye.</p><p>The ticket was jutting out of the pocket of Bren\u2019s abandoned trousers, like it was trying to wriggle to freedom. He could still read half of it, upside down but still, black niello letters etched into the gold. </p><p><i>All are welcome!</i></p><p>Bren tucked the ticket into his latest banned book, slipped it into his ratty old coat, the one Father didn\u2019t let him wear. He swung it around himself, hood up, tucking his distinctive red hair into his scarf. Everyone in the district knew Archmage Ikithon\u2019s red haired ward.</p><p>The night air was cold, reproachful, as he opened his window. But Bren didn\u2019t stop, he didn\u2019t even pause, he had to move before Father stopped stewing in his anger and put up the wards around his room to stop him going to get food. Out there was music and light and colour, out there was the furthest thing from in here that there could possibly be. </p><p>Out there was Mr Tealeaf, who\u2019d looked at him and smiled kindly.</p><p>That\u2019s what he needed right now. So that\u2019s where he went. </p>",

And Bren sees a way to a new name, a new life and a chance at happiness.</p><p>-</p><p>An AU based on the story of Kvothe\u2019s parents from The Kingkiller Chronicles</p><hr><p>For Bren, life had become all about small acts of rebellion.</p><p>They could never be much, he had to conserve what little bravery he had, sheltering it in cupped hands like an anaemic flame wavering and flickering dangerously at every breeze. But every so often it would flare and skip, a strengthening heartbeat, and Bren would slide the change from an errand run up his sleeve rather than turning it over with the goods he\u2019d been sent to buy or he would borrow a book from the city library he knew wouldn\u2019t be approved of, tucking it in his coat, feeling its edges press against his chest like a stab of thrilling guilt as the rest of his selection were turned over and inspected and approved of when he got home. Sometimes it was even as small as waiting until the last possible second to begin his chores, letting his thoughts wander, letting the day be his for as long as he could before he had to remember that his life wasn\u2019t his own. </p><p>And sometimes, when he was passing the door to Father\u2019s office and heard, for the first time in years, an unfamiliar voice, he would stop in his tracks and listen. </p><p>A small act of rebellion. Never seen, never thought of, never acknowledged by anyone but him, spent sparingly like a last clipped copper penny. But as long as he still had those to give, there was something to live for. </p><p>So Bren stopped and he listened. </p><p>He knew every single person in the small borough of Rexxantrum that Father was in charge of. He knew the bakers and butchers and grocers who would come to plead that they couldn\u2019t pay the taxes and leave more unhappy than they came, he knew the crownsguard and constables who gave him bribes, he knew the other archmagi with their sonorous voices and quivering hands. </p><p>But this voice was new. It was rich and smooth and full of life, it was like music. The more Bren heard of it, the more eagerly he pressed his ear to the crack in the heavy oak door, like a plant aching towards sunlight. </p><p>\u201cWe are a registered troupe, Mr Trent, I can assure you of that,\u201d the voice said, confident and sprightly, like everything was an amusing joke, \u201cNot one ounce of trouble in the five years I\u2019ve been in charge.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cBe that as it may, we are a different people in Rexxantrum,\u201d Father\u2019s voice was low and gravelly, instantly making Bren\u2019s heart kick with fear as he recognised the subtle signs of anger, the signs he\u2019d been trained to hear and respond to, to do whatever he could to make them go away.</p><p>But the voice didn\u2019t know the signs. It bulled on. </p><p>\u201cMy circus is for all people, Mr Ikithon. All people crave a little excitement every now and then, a little break from their hard working lives. In exchange for a pitch in the main square and ninety percent of the show intake, your folk can have a night of magic and frivolity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinking and debauchery, you mean,\u201d Father\u2019s voice was a whip, smacking down the other and outside the door, Bren flinched, \u201cAnd please do not call what you do <i>magic</i>. What I do is magic. You are speaking to one of the archmages of the Cerberus Assembly, sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am fully aware of that. And you can call me Mr Tealeaf. Or Mollymauk, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d </p><p>Bren\u2019s heart crashed to the floor. Couldn\u2019t the man hear the danger in Father\u2019s voice? Didn\u2019t he realise he had to back away and do it quickly, beg forgiveness? </p><p>\u201cBe grateful I am deigning to refer to you as sir at all,\u201d the reply was chilly, the end of every word bitten off, \u201cYour circus may go elsewhere. We have no place for your kind in Rexxantrum.\u201d </p><p>There was a long pause. Bren knew he should turn and walk away as fast as he could, move on and forget what he\u2019d heard, go on with his day. Father would be furious if he saw how little work he\u2019d done that morning and what he\u2019d do if he found him listening at the door didn\u2019t even bear thinking about. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t. So he was there to hear the soft chuckle and scrape of a chair as Mr Tealeaf drew back and replied, still bright as summer grass though there was an edge to his words that hadn\u2019t been there before.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Ikithon. I\u2019ll be sure to write to Baron de Rolo and ask him to take your fair city off the rotation.\u201d</p><p>This new pause was shorter though heavier, weighing like a ton of lead. </p><p>\u201cBaron de Rolo?\u201d Father sounded like he was about to explode. Though Bren was no longer afraid. This mysterious stranger had an unseen shield. </p><p>\u201cOur patron,\u201d the smile was obvious in his voice, \u201cThough its more his lovely wife who funds our pursuits, she\u2019ll be most upset to hear we\u2019ve been barred from the capital of the Empire. The lady Vex\u2019halia, of course you must know her, seeing as you\u2019re an archmage and all. Our writ of performance is right here, affixed with the seal of Whitestone\u2026\u201d a rustle of fabric and paper, \u201c\u2026as you would have known if you\u2019d asked to see it. It\u2019s the law to do that for all travelling performance troupes, just so you know.\u201d </p><p>This pause was all iron, a bitter taste in the mouth. </p><p>\u201cOne night,\u201d Father practically snarled, \u201cThat is all. Then you leave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all we ever asked.\u201d </p><p>Bren started as he heard Father\u2019s chair scrape across the carpet. The spell broken, he he straightened so fast there was a stab of dizziness in the base of his skull and his heart lurched like it was getting left behind, barrelling to the end of the corridor and making himself look very busy pulling some books off of the hall bookcase, hoping it wasn\u2019t visible at this distance that it was a completely random assortment, not some volumes to help him write his latest essay. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t help his eyes sliding to the opening office door. Father was the first to step out, always in his ceremonial robes, face long and lined and hard. The man who followed was so different, so out of place here in the town house that it was like two completely different artists with completely different sensibilities had been forced to share the same canvas. He was fabulously dressed, in a long coat of plush, plum velvet that forked at the end and whose dagged sleeves revealed long arms decorated in ink and gilded metal; high waisted trousers in the same colour scheme with a split pattern, stripes on one side and diamonds on the other and long boots of supple, soft black leather. Under his arm was a hat, tall and proud, a true showman\u2019s hat. Though quite how it was going to fit over horns that size, Bren had no idea. </p><p>A tiefling. An honest to goodness tiefling, here in Rexxantrum.</p><p>No wonder Father had a face the colour of a storm cloud ready to burst. </p><p>With a smile that said he fully understood the affect he was having on the archmage and was enjoying it intensely, the tielfing swished a long purple tail and swept the hat onto his head with a grand gesture, revealing the fact it had two cleverly concealed holes for his horns. </p><p>\u201cYou should come to the show, Mr Ikithon,\u201d he flashed a set of sharply pointed incisors, reaching into a cavernous sleeve to pull out a piece of gold paper, holding it out to Father, \u201cGive yourself a night off. See what the Fletching and Moondrop Travelling Carnival of Curiosities has to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Father said stiffly, pointedly taking the ticket and immediately letting it fall to the carpet, as if it had never been between his long, white fingers. He made no move to retrieve it. Neither did Mr Tealeaf.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, sir,\u201d the tielfing smiled and started down the stairs, \u201cWe\u2019ll cause not a spot of trouble, you\u2019ll see.\u201d </p><p>Though in that moment, as he turned, his eyes- drop cut rubies with no pupils- rested lightly on Bren, there at the end of the corridor. Immediately, he felt his cheeks go red, which Father always snapped at him to control as it looked ridiculous with his auburn hair and made his freckles stand out. But the tielfing didn\u2019t snap or look vaguely disgusted. He just smiled and winked, swift and careless, before disappearing down the stairs in a swirl of velvet. </p><p>Struck silent, Bren watched with his mouth slightly open, stirrings in the pit of his stomach. </p><p>\u201cBren Aldric Ermendrud.\u201d</p><p>Father\u2019s voice was sharp and dangerous and it rushed at Bren with a horrible, sickening certainly that he was about to face the weight of all the built up fury and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. </p><p>\u201cClose your mouth, boy,\u201d Father snapped, striding down the corridor until he was bearing down upon him. Even though Bren was twenty five and had grown taller than Father ever would, he still managed to make him feel an inch off the ground by sheer force of will. </p><p>\u201cYou look like a fool,\u201d he knocked the books from Bren\u2019s arms with a hard, sharp shove, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, standing here gawking when you should be working?\u201d</p><p>Bren stared down at his feet, biting his lip hard, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father.\u201d</p><p>There was a long, horrible moment of silence as Bren looked at the scattered books, lying there like limp, dead birds and prayed Father couldn\u2019t read his thoughts, couldn\u2019t see those stirrings inside him. </p><p>Maybe even if he couldn\u2019t see them, he could sense the shadows of them, for he snarled, \u201cIf I hear of you having anything to do with those deviant circus folk, I will punish you more severely than you have ever known. Am I clear, Bren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he managed to choke out, fear making his voice frail and shaky though he knew that was the desired effect. </p><p>Though his hands seemed aged, they moved faster than lightning, tightening around Bren\u2019s chin like a vice and jerking it upwards so he couldn\u2019t help but stare into those red tinged eyes. </p><p>\u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes <i>Father.\u201d</i></p><p>After Father had turned back into his office and slammed the door shut, leaving only his harsh command to pick up those books ringing in Bren\u2019s ears, he stayed still for a while, eyes closed, , shaky fingers pressed to his neck, counting his heart beats. If he got to ten, he would be okay. He just had to get to ten. </p><p>Ten heartbeats came and went and Bren could breathe once more. He started to gather up the books, straightening any bent pages, brushing dust from the covers. He let the simple task inflate until it took up every ounce of space in his head, focused utterly on it, allowed no other thoughts inside. </p><p>That was the best way to survive. </p><p>But then a glint of gold caught his eye. The ticket Mr Tealeaf left had become caught in the fringes of the hall carpet, looking a little forlorn, like a butterfly who\u2019d forgotten how to fly. A few steps brought Bren close enough to read the embossed printing on its surface.</p><p><i>The Fletching and Moondrop Travelling Carnival of Curiosities. Admit One. All are welcome!</i></p><p>Before he knew what he was really doing, the ticket was in his hand. Then it was in his pocket. </p><p>More thoughts pressed in on him and he fended them off as best he could, drowning them out by reading the titles of each book aloud, carefully ordering them by author then by colour, shifting them around on the shelf. </p><p>All the while the ticket stayed in his pocket, feeling far heavier than a little piece of foiled paper should. </p><p>\u201cStraighten your shoulders, boy. Your feet need to be planted firmly on the ground, how many times do I have to tell you?\u201d</p><p>Bren shifted his stance in accordance with Father\u2019s barked instructions, though he\u2019d always felt more comfortable on the balls of his feet where he could change direction more easily. </p><p>The ground was cold and hard underneath him, the air chilled. But they had to practise in the basement, there were far too many expensive, important things to break in the rest of the manor. </p><p>Magic was dangerous, Father had always drilled that into him before all else. It was only permitted within tight boundaries, under strict rules, compartmentalised and categorised and controlled. Using it carelessly, without understanding, that was for carnival hucksters and hedge wizards, people made to squeeze pennies out of ignorant country folk. </p><p>People like Mr Tealeaf, Bren supposed, thinking guiltily of the ticket still in the pocket of his trousers, neatly folded with the rest of his work clothes up in his room. </p><p>As he\u2019d dressed for practice, into the loose half trousers and shirt that left him free for movement, Bren made a decision. He\u2019d tear up the ticket as soon as he could, throw the pieces out of his window. Already he was working on three different knots of stress, each one a different scenario where Father discovered he had the ticket and none of them ended well. The risk simply wasn\u2019t worth it. Small acts of rebellion were one thing but outright foolishness was another. </p><p>But he\u2019d already been late for practice and hadn\u2019t had the time yet. But he would destroy it. He would. </p><p>\u201cWe will focus on Evocation spells today,\u201d Father announced, pacing at the other end of the cavernous basement, \u201cYour last essay on that particular subject was poor. Let\u2019s see if something a little more direct will help you see sense.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes Father,\u201d Bren nodded, holding his hands ready in front of him, mind already flickering through the motions necessary for the main spells he knew. </p><p>\u201cNow, I want to see some improvement from our last spar,\u201d Father continued, taking no note of how ready his charge was, how he had dropped into the right stance without needing to be asked, \u201cThe last time you were slow to react. It made you clumsy, there was no elegance to it. And-\u201c</p><p>His last words were lost to a roar as a burst of fire erupted from his hands and flew towards Bren, straight and furious as a thrown dagger. Bren yelped, all his readiness evaporating as the fire engulfed him, burning where it touched, scorching his skin an angry red before disappearing as its energy ran out. </p><p>Raw and tingling, nerves frayed and stinging with the injustice of it, Bren lost his composure, \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready! You gave me no warning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither will your enemies, boy,\u201d Father replied simply, letting loose another plume in his direction.</p><p>This time Bren dodged, rolling, skin screaming where the rough stone floor scraped against it. As soon as he could, he countered with a thunderclap, making it reverberate through the floor so even if it hit, it would do no more than throw Father off balance. But he couldn\u2019t even manage that. Father simply stilled the vibrations with a blast of his own, the exact frequency to fizzle it out into nothing. And then it was the horrific screeching energy of an eldritch blast, the one that made Bren\u2019s ears ring. Somehow he managed to throw himself underneath it, cowering until it past. </p><p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Father\u2019s voice cut through the screeching as it bounced around the space, \u201cClumsy. Sloppy.\u201d </p><p>Bren covered his face, breathing heavy. It was so unfair. Father did everything he could to break him apart, to knock him back. For him, sparring wasn\u2019t about learning, it was about punishment. Bren didn\u2019t feel like a student, he felt like a punching bag. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t <i>fair.</i></p><p>In that instant, all the anger, all the fear, all the emptiness years of it had hollowed out inside him was filled with something Bren couldn\u2019t name. In the crackling, ozone stinking wake of their spells, he stood, held out his hands and let that something fly from him as he spoke a word he couldn\u2019t recall afterwards. Not the simple spheres that had been thrown before, a sheer wall of flame erupted in the space, roaring its fury as soon as it appeared. For a moment, Father was awash in a bright orange glow. </p><p>And he looked terrified. </p><p>Bren wavered, uncertainty flooding back into him as the wall exploded out of existence. While the heat washed over him, not even leaving a lingering heat, it struck Father full in the chest, making him stagger and fall back with a cry of pain. Bren cried out with him. </p><p>The dungeon was filled with a smoke that reeked of sulphur, hanging heavily in the hair like clumps of fine gossamer. When Father stood, his clothes were singed, his hair was in disarray and there was an angry red mark lancing across his face. </p><p>Bren was already at the door, scrabbling at the handle, when Father caught him by the collar and dragged him back. </p><p>Though he knew it would only make it worse, at the unbridled fury in Father\u2019s eyes, he desperately babbled out, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>The backhand hit him harder than any spell, knocking his head against the wall. </p><p>As the pain rang through him, a less sensible part of him cried out, \u201cI don\u2019t understand! You want me to be a powerful wizard, why do you hurt me every time I beat you-\u201c</p><p>A force lifted him and pinned him to the wall, forcing his jaw shut. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Father rasped, still smoking slightly, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare utter those words. You are nothing, do you hear me? You are garbage. You are worthless. I am doing everything I can to nurture the miniscule scrap of talent you have and you should be grateful I am wasting my time on a pathetic boy like you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Bren nodded frantically, wincing as the press continued, achingly slow but relentless, caught between the implacable force and the cold stone wall. </p><p>And then it was gone. He fell to the floor, wheezing and crying, only able to nod over and over and pray it would be enough.</p><p>\u201cClean yourself up. There will be no dinner for you tonight,\u201d Father snapped, turning and marching away. </p><p>Bren was still crying as he staggered to his room, lurching for his bed like it was his last island of safety. He pressed his face to the pillows to muffle the sound, knowing Father would be disgusted to hear it, and gave himself over to the storm inside him. </p><p>He knew he\u2019d just performed a fantastic piece of magic, far above anything he\u2019d done before, but there was no joy in it. Just a bitter ashy taste. </p><p>All he\u2019d ever wanted was to be as strong a wizard as he could be, learn everything, read every book, find a safety and security in magic he\u2019d never found anywhere else. But it was never going to make Father proud of him. It was never going to make the sharp words, the slaps, the strikes hurt any less. </p><p>Bren had never wanted to be somewhere else, someone else so much in his entire life. </p><p>That was when, for the second time in the same day, a glint of gold caught his eye.</p><p>The ticket was jutting out of the pocket of Bren\u2019s abandoned trousers, like it was trying to wriggle to freedom. He could still read half of it, upside down but still, black niello letters etched into the gold. </p><p><i>All are welcome!</i></p><p>Bren tucked the ticket into his latest banned book, slipped it into his ratty old coat, the one Father didn\u2019t let him wear. He swung it around himself, hood up, tucking his distinctive red hair into his scarf. Everyone in the district knew Archmage Ikithon\u2019s red haired ward.</p><p>The night air was cold, reproachful, as he opened his window. But Bren didn\u2019t stop, he didn\u2019t even pause, he had to move before Father stopped stewing in his anger and put up the wards around his room to stop him going to get food. Out there was music and light and colour, out there was the furthest thing from in here that there could possibly be. </p><p>Out there was Mr Tealeaf, who\u2019d looked at him and smiled kindly.</p><p>That\u2019s what he needed right now. So that\u2019s where he went. </p>",

And Bren sees a way to a new name, a new life and a chance at happiness.</p><p>-</p><p>An AU based on the story of Kvothe&rsquo;s parents from The Kingkiller Chronicles</p><hr /><p>For Bren, life had become all about small acts of rebellion.</p><p>They could never be much, he had to conserve what little bravery he had, sheltering it in cupped hands like an anaemic flame wavering and flickering dangerously at every breeze. But every so often it would flare and skip, a strengthening heartbeat, and Bren would slide the change from an errand run up his sleeve rather than turning it over with the goods he&rsquo;d been sent to buy or he would borrow a book from the city library he knew wouldn&rsquo;t be approved of, tucking it in his coat, feeling its edges press against his chest like a stab of thrilling guilt as the rest of his selection were turned over and inspected and approved of when he got home. Sometimes it was even as small as waiting until the last possible second to begin his chores, letting his thoughts wander, letting the day be his for as long as he could before he had to remember that his life wasn&rsquo;t his own. </p><p>And sometimes, when he was passing the door to Father&rsquo;s office and heard, for the first time in years, an unfamiliar voice, he would stop in his tracks and listen. </p><p>A small act of rebellion. Never seen, never thought of, never acknowledged by anyone but him, spent sparingly like a last clipped copper penny. But as long as he still had those to give, there was something to live for. </p><p>So Bren stopped and he listened. </p><p>He knew every single person in the small borough of Rexxantrum that Father was in charge of. He knew the bakers and butchers and grocers who would come to plead that they couldn&rsquo;t pay the taxes and leave more unhappy than they came, he knew the crownsguard and constables who gave him bribes, he knew the other archmagi with their sonorous voices and quivering hands. </p><p>But this voice was new. It was rich and smooth and full of life, it was like music. The more Bren heard of it, the more eagerly he pressed his ear to the crack in the heavy oak door, like a plant aching towards sunlight. </p><p>&ldquo;We are a registered troupe, Mr Trent, I can assure you of that,&rdquo; the voice said, confident and sprightly, like everything was an amusing joke, &ldquo;Not one ounce of trouble in the five years I&rsquo;ve been in charge.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, we are a different people in Rexxantrum,&rdquo; Father&rsquo;s voice was low and gravelly, instantly making Bren&rsquo;s heart kick with fear as he recognised the subtle signs of anger, the signs he&rsquo;d been trained to hear and respond to, to do whatever he could to make them go away.</p><p>But the voice didn&rsquo;t know the signs.

Am I clear, Bren?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he managed to choke out, fear making his voice frail and shaky though he knew that was the desired effect. </p><p>Though his hands seemed aged, they moved faster than lightning, tightening around Bren&rsquo;s chin like a vice and jerking it upwards so he couldn&rsquo;t help but stare into those red tinged eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes <i>Father.&rdquo;</i></p><p>After Father had turned back into his office and slammed the door shut, leaving only his harsh command to pick up those books ringing in Bren&rsquo;s ears, he stayed still for a while, eyes closed, , shaky fingers pressed to his neck, counting his heart beats. If he got to ten, he would be okay. He just had to get to ten. </p><p>Ten heartbeats came and went and Bren could breathe once more. He started to gather up the books, straightening any bent pages, brushing dust from the covers. He let the simple task inflate until it took up every ounce of space in his head, focused utterly on it, allowed no other thoughts inside. </p><p>That was the best way to survive. </p><p>But then a glint of gold caught his eye. The ticket Mr Tealeaf left had become caught in the fringes of the hall carpet, looking a little forlorn, like a butterfly who&rsquo;d forgotten how to fly. A few steps brought Bren close enough to read the embossed printing on its surface.</p><p><i>The Fletching and Moondrop Travelling Carnival of Curiosities. Admit One. All are welcome!</i></p><p>Before he knew what he was really doing, the ticket was in his hand. Then it was in his pocket. </p><p>More thoughts pressed in on him and he fended them off as best he could, drowning them out by reading the titles of each book aloud, carefully ordering them by author then by colour, shifting them around on the shelf. </p><p>All the while the ticket stayed in his pocket, feeling far heavier than a little piece of foiled paper should. </p><p>&ldquo;Straighten your shoulders, boy. Your feet need to be planted firmly on the ground, how many times do I have to tell you?&rdquo;</p><p>Bren shifted his stance in accordance with Father&rsquo;s barked instructions, though he&rsquo;d always felt more comfortable on the balls of his feet where he could change direction more easily. </p><p>The ground was cold and hard underneath him, the air chilled. But they had to practise in the basement, there were far too many expensive, important things to break in the rest of the manor. </p><p>Magic was dangerous, Father had always drilled that into him before all else. It was only permitted within tight boundaries, under strict rules, compartmentalised and categorised and controlled. Using it carelessly, without understanding, that was for carnival hucksters and hedge wizards, people made to squeeze pennies out of ignorant country folk. </p><p>People like Mr Tealeaf, Bren supposed, thinking guiltily of the ticket still in the pocket of his trousers, neatly folded with the rest of his work clothes up in his room. </p><p>As he&rsquo;d dressed for practice, into the loose half trousers and shirt that left him free for movement, Bren made a decision. He&rsquo;d tear up the ticket as soon as he could, throw the pieces out of his window. Already he was working on three different knots of stress, each one a different scenario where Father discovered he had the ticket and none of them ended well. The risk simply wasn&rsquo;t worth it. Small acts of rebellion were one thing but outright foolishness was another. </p><p>But he&rsquo;d already been late for practice and hadn&rsquo;t had the time yet. But he would destroy it. He would. </p><p>&ldquo;We will focus on Evocation spells today,&rdquo; Father announced, pacing at the other end of the cavernous basement, &ldquo;Your last essay on that particular subject was poor. Let&rsquo;s see if something a little more direct will help you see sense.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes Father,&rdquo; Bren nodded, holding his hands ready in front of him, mind already flickering through the motions necessary for the main spells he knew. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, I want to see some improvement from our last spar,&rdquo; Father continued, taking no note of how ready his charge was, how he had dropped into the right stance without needing to be asked, &ldquo;The last time you were slow to react. It made you clumsy, there was no elegance to it. And-&ldquo;</p><p>His last words were lost to a roar as a burst of fire erupted from his hands and flew towards Bren, straight and furious as a thrown dagger. Bren yelped, all his readiness evaporating as the fire engulfed him, burning where it touched, scorching his skin an angry red before disappearing as its energy ran out. </p><p>Raw and tingling, nerves frayed and stinging with the injustice of it, Bren lost his composure, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ready! You gave me no warning!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And neither will your enemies, boy,&rdquo; Father replied simply, letting loose another plume in his direction.</p><p>This time Bren dodged, rolling, skin screaming where the rough stone floor scraped against it. As soon as he could, he countered with a thunderclap, making it reverberate through the floor so even if it hit, it would do no more than throw Father off balance. But he couldn&rsquo;t even manage that. Father simply stilled the vibrations with a blast of his own, the exact frequency to fizzle it out into nothing. And then it was the horrific screeching energy of an eldritch blast, the one that made Bren&rsquo;s ears ring. Somehow he managed to throw himself underneath it, cowering until it past. </p><p>&ldquo;Like I said,&rdquo; Father&rsquo;s voice cut through the screeching as it bounced around the space, &ldquo;Clumsy. Sloppy.&rdquo; </p><p>Bren covered his face, breathing heavy. It was so unfair. Father did everything he could to break him apart, to knock him back. For him, sparring wasn&rsquo;t about learning, it was about punishment. Bren didn&rsquo;t feel like a student, he felt like a punching bag. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t <i>fair.</i></p><p>In that instant, all the anger, all the fear, all the emptiness years of it had hollowed out inside him was filled with something Bren couldn&rsquo;t name. In the crackling, ozone stinking wake of their spells, he stood, held out his hands and let that something fly from him as he spoke a word he couldn&rsquo;t recall afterwards. Not the simple spheres that had been thrown before, a sheer wall of flame erupted in the space, roaring its fury as soon as it appeared. For a moment, Father was awash in a bright orange glow. </p><p>And he looked terrified. </p><p>Bren wavered, uncertainty flooding back into him as the wall exploded out of existence. While the heat washed over him, not even leaving a lingering heat, it struck Father full in the chest, making him stagger and fall back with a cry of pain. Bren cried out with him. </p><p>The dungeon was filled with a smoke that reeked of sulphur, hanging heavily in the hair like clumps of fine gossamer. When Father stood, his clothes were singed, his hair was in disarray and there was an angry red mark lancing across his face. </p><p>Bren was already at the door, scrabbling at the handle, when Father caught him by the collar and dragged him back. </p><p>Though he knew it would only make it worse, at the unbridled fury in Father&rsquo;s eyes, he desperately babbled out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The backhand hit him harder than any spell, knocking his head against the wall. </p><p>As the pain rang through him, a less sensible part of him cried out, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand! You want me to be a powerful wizard, why do you hurt me every time I beat you-&ldquo;</p><p>A force lifted him and pinned him to the wall, forcing his jaw shut. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare,&rdquo; Father rasped, still smoking slightly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare utter those words. You are nothing, do you hear me? You are garbage. You are worthless. I am doing everything I can to nurture the miniscule scrap of talent you have and you should be grateful I am wasting my time on a pathetic boy like you. Understand?&rdquo;</p><p>Bren nodded frantically, wincing as the press continued, achingly slow but relentless, caught between the implacable force and the cold stone wall. </p><p>And then it was gone. He fell to the floor, wheezing and crying, only able to nod over and over and pray it would be enough.</p><p>&ldquo;Clean yourself up. There will be no dinner for you tonight,&rdquo; Father snapped, turning and marching away. </p><p>Bren was still crying as he staggered to his room, lurching for his bed like it was his last island of safety. He pressed his face to the pillows to muffle the sound, knowing Father would be disgusted to hear it, and gave himself over to the storm inside him. </p><p>He knew he&rsquo;d just performed a fantastic piece of magic, far above anything he&rsquo;d done before, but there was no joy in it. Just a bitter ashy taste. </p><p>All he&rsquo;d ever wanted was to be as strong a wizard as he could be, learn everything, read every book, find a safety and security in magic he&rsquo;d never found anywhere else. But it was never going to make Father proud of him. It was never going to make the sharp words, the slaps, the strikes hurt any less. </p><p>Bren had never wanted to be somewhere else, someone else so much in his entire life. </p><p>That was when, for the second time in the same day, a glint of gold caught his eye.</p><p>The ticket was jutting out of the pocket of Bren&rsquo;s abandoned trousers, like it was trying to wriggle to freedom. He could still read half of it, upside down but still, black niello letters etched into the gold. </p><p><i>All are welcome!</i></p><p>Bren tucked the ticket into his latest banned book, slipped it into his ratty old coat, the one Father didn&rsquo;t let him wear. He swung it around himself, hood up, tucking his distinctive red hair into his scarf. Everyone in the district knew Archmage Ikithon&rsquo;s red haired ward.</p><p>The night air was cold, reproachful, as he opened his window. But Bren didn&rsquo;t stop, he didn&rsquo;t even pause, he had to move before Father stopped stewing in his anger and put up the wards around his room to stop him going to get food. Out there was music and light and colour, out there was the furthest thing from in here that there could possibly be. </p><p>Out there was Mr Tealeaf, who&rsquo;d looked at him and smiled kindly.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what he needed right now. So that&rsquo;s where he went. </p>",

And Bren sees a way to a new name, a new life and a chance at happiness.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>An AU based on the story of Kvothe&rsquo;s parents from The Kingkiller Chronicles</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For Bren, life had become all about small acts of rebellion.</p>\n<p>They could never be much, he had to conserve what little bravery he had, sheltering it in cupped hands like an anaemic flame wavering and flickering dangerously at every breeze. But every so often it would flare and skip, a strengthening heartbeat, and Bren would slide the change from an errand run up his sleeve rather than turning it over with the goods he&rsquo;d been sent to buy or he would borrow a book from the city library he knew wouldn&rsquo;t be approved of, tucking it in his coat, feeling its edges press against his chest like a stab of thrilling guilt as the rest of his selection were turned over and inspected and approved of when he got home. Sometimes it was even as small as waiting until the last possible second to begin his chores, letting his thoughts wander, letting the day be his for as long as he could before he had to remember that his life wasn&rsquo;t his own. </p>\n<p>And sometimes, when he was passing the door to Father&rsquo;s office and heard, for the first time in years, an unfamiliar voice, he would stop in his tracks and listen. </p>\n<p>A small act of rebellion. Never seen, never thought of, never acknowledged by anyone but him, spent sparingly like a last clipped copper penny. But as long as he still had those to give, there was something to live for. </p>\n<p>So Bren stopped and he listened. </p>\n<p>He knew every single person in the small borough of Rexxantrum that Father was in charge of. He knew the bakers and butchers and grocers who would come to plead that they couldn&rsquo;t pay the taxes and leave more unhappy than they came, he knew the crownsguard and constables who gave him bribes, he knew the other archmagi with their sonorous voices and quivering hands. </p>\n<p>But this voice was new. It was rich and smooth and full of life, it was like music. The more Bren heard of it, the more eagerly he pressed his ear to the crack in the heavy oak door, like a plant aching towards sunlight. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are a registered troupe, Mr Trent, I can assure you of that,&rdquo; the voice said, confident and sprightly, like everything was an amusing joke, &ldquo;Not one ounce of trouble in the five years I&rsquo;ve been in charge.&rdquo; </p>\n</p>",
