Uk&rsquo;atoa can&rsquo;t possibly be pleased that his most fervent chosen is dead, and can&rsquo;t possibly be pleased that another of his chosen had a hand in her demise.</p><p>So who knows, maybe we will end up seeing a multiclass somewhere down the line for Fjord if he truly does refuse to free Uk&rsquo;atoa from its prison.</p><p>(Unless of course the Avantika we saw was Vera in disguise via seeming of something and Avantika is still alive and well, but i doubt it)<br /></p>",

The lights from the candles lining the wall are warm and dim, and the people are mostly hidden in shadows. I am not comfortable here. The music is loud and the people are talking over each other and I feel large, like there is not enough space for me. I am happier when we sleep outside. I like the quiet and complex sounds animals make when the sun goes down.</p><p>Taverns seemed easier when Molly was here.</p><p>Jester is leaned over the table and her eyes are lit up by flashes of candlelight as she grins at Caleb. I don\u2019t catch what she says, but I see Caleb press his lips together in both a grimace and a smile. One of the rings around Jester\u2019s horn is shining, like she just recently polished it.</p><p>I look away.</p><p>Beau is next to me and she is talking to Fjord. She says, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you anything.\u201d</p><p>Fjord says, \u201cI\u2019m not putting a bet on that, Beau.\u201d I take the clay mug full of warm ale in front of me off of the table and bring it to my lips as I watch Beau. When she speaks, her jaw tightens. Everything about her is lean and taut. I can tell she is almost always tense, her back muscles drawn together and her hand is clenched in a fist. This is Beau\u2019s natural state: defensive. Ready. I swallow some of my drink and it tastes like wheat.</p><p>I look up at her face again and she\u2019s looking at me. Her eyes are really blue. \u201cYasha?\u201d She says.</p><p>\u201cYes, Beau?\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head. \u201cIt\u2019s just&ndash;you just have something&ndash;\u201d I gesture at the side of my mouth in a brushing motion. Beau goes to wipe her face with the back of her hand but she\u2019s missing it, I think it\u2019s a bit of sauce, and I reach for her face without thinking and my thumb touches her lip and then her cheek and I rub it away.</p><p>Her eyes are open wide when she says, \u201cUm. Thanks, Yasha.\u201d She looks at the table.</p><p>Fjord is watching us from across the table. I notice that Caduceus is now looking, too. He makes me uneasy because I\u2019m not sure how to talk to him. I\u2019m afraid that he might say something I won\u2019t have a response for.</p><p>Beau slips away from the table, swinging her legs over the bench we sat on together with an ease I admire.</p><p>Caduceus is leaning forward with his head resting in his palm and his pink hair lies in front of his face, covering one of his eyes. \u201cInteresting.\u201d I meet his eyes for a second and he doesn\u2019t blink.</p><p>I turn and watch Beau as she weaves through the crowd towards the back of the room, where a bartender is pouring drinks from casks.</p><p>\u201cBeau was just tryin\u2019 to get me to bet her she could sleep with the bartender tonight.\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI told her that was a foolish idea, but looks like she\u2019s goin\u2019 for it.\u201d His voice has a little smile in it like he\u2019s amused but I don\u2019t really feel amused.</p><p>I sit up a little straighter and feel my brows furrow. Generally, I find Beau amusing, but I feel annoyance right now. I\u2019m annoyed with her.</p><p>Caduceus leans in closer and says, \u201cDoes that bother you, Yasha?\u201d</p><p>Fjord laughs and says, \u201cWhy would that bother Yasha? She knows how Beau is.\u201d</p><p>I look away from them, down the table at the rest of the group, hoping one of them might change the subject. Nott is laughing with her flask in hand and her mask is resting against her chest. Jester is gesturing wildly and Caleb has a small smile. None of them are paying attention to us.</p><p>I clear my throat and look back at Fjord and Caduceus. \u201cNo, I\u2019m definitely not bothered.\u201d I get up from the bench. \u201cExcuse me, I, um, I have a headache and I need to go to bed.\u201d The music had paused but now it is picking back up and a woman is singing.</p><p><i>In the dark town of Shady Grove on a Monday eve&ndash;</i></p><p>I walk away from the table and move through the crowd. People move aside for me when they see me coming. I try not to look at Beau when I walk past her to the staircase at the back of the tavern, but I see her in my peripheral. She\u2019s leaning against the bar. I keep walking and now I\u2019m going up the stairs and I can\u2019t see her anymore.</p><p><i>I met a fair maid as lovely as you\u2019d believe&ndash;</i></p><p>The hallway at the top of the stairs is well lit by torches and it\u2019s brighter than below. There are numbers painted on the doors. I realize that Jester has the keys for our rooms tonight.</p><p><i>She wore no jewels and her eyes were bright&ndash;</i></p><p>I don\u2019t want to go back downstairs so I keep walking down the hallway. The din of laughter and conversation fades as I walk, though it never quite dies. There is a door at the very end of the hallway and I try the handle, hoping it might lead outside. It opens, and there is a small deck with a staircase beyond it.</p><p><i>Her hair as black as a moonless night&ndash;</i></p><p>I go outside. The air is very cold and there are trees hanging over a path behind the tavern. A light wind blows through and the leaves rustle, sounding a little like the waves on the beach in Nicodranas. I shiver. I start to relax. I lean against the railing. Light escapes from the tavern windows beneath me, giving the plants beneath the trees a warm glow, like they are props on a stage.</p><p>It did bother me that Beau left to go chat with the bartender. I\u2019m sure Caduceus knew that, but Fjord is like me. Clueless.</p><p>I miss Molly. I\u2019m almost never not missing Molly, but right now I wish I could talk to him. \u201cWhat would you say?\u201d I ask the trees.</p><p>I picture him standing next to me, leaning over the railing. He has a wicked grin. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u00a0<i>really\u00a0</i>like that bratty girl, right?\u201d I speak for him, and I can almost remember how his mouth moved when he talked, how his lower lip got stuck behind his fangs on hard syllables.</p><p>I feel my mouth turn down and my eyes get hot for a second. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, Molly. She\u2019s changed. Everything has changed so much since you\u2019ve been gone.\u201d</p><p>His ghost disappears because I can\u2019t picture him here anymore. He could have grown with us. I don\u2019t know what type of person he could have become, and this is what really strikes my heart. He is frozen in time, in the dirt, and he does not get to redeem or create or learn anymore.</p><p>It is unfair.</p><p>I look up at the stars and let the air cool my head. I take a deep breath and let out a stammering exhale.</p><p>There is something specifically about Beauregard that makes me want to be around her. I like when she laughs and I like when she tries to look tough. I like the color of her eyes when we fight together. I don\u2019t know when it was that I started to like those things about her, but it was after Molly. After Darktow.</p><p>I \u00a0hear footsteps behind me and I instinctively place my hand on the hilt of my dagger, the one Caleb gave to me (\u201cFor the next time you give me a shave\u201d).</p><p>I turn and it\u2019s Beau. She\u2019s holding a key in her fingers and holding it out to me. Her face is covered in shadow so I can\u2019t make out her expression. \u201cJester said to take this to you.\u201d</p><p>I reach for it. \u201cWell\u2026 thank you,\u201d I say. \u201cHow&ndash;how\u2019s it going in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNott got up on the table and started shouting, so I\u2019d say business as usual.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI meant with the bartender.\u201d</p><p>She sort of shrugs and looks at the ground. \u201cGood, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I tuck the key away and fold my arms across my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Nothing?\u201d She says, and she\u2019s looking me in the eyes now. I can tell because a little bit of starlight is reflecting off of her brown skin. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m not sure what to say. Something is starting to click into place. \u201cAre you angry with me, Beau?\u201d</p><p>She throws her hands up in an exaggerated motion. \u201cMaybe I am!\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to say something and then I stop. \u201cOh,\u201d is all I can think to reply.</p><p>Beau makes a low, rumbling noise and steps towards me. \u201cI\u2019m tired of this. Look, Yasha, do you want me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I surprise us both when I say it. My words come out in a little white cloud when they hit the cold air. \u201cI want you.\u201d It feels like a little wind has picked up inside my chest. The truth of it is making my skin buzz and I look away from Beau. \u201cBut I can\u2019t&ndash;\u201d</p><p>She places her hand on my cheek and it\u2019s so warm I flinch a little, and then her lips are pressed against mine. It\u2019s too much and not enough all at once and I think about pulling away but then I start to feel like I do when a fight starts.</p><p>I hear a crack of thunder in the distance and the hair on the back of my neck stands on end.</p><p>I put my hand on her face and I\u2019m kissing her back, pulling her towards me. I push her inside and against the wall of the hallway. Beau pulls her face away and says, \u201cI want you, too.\u201d She\u2019s grinning. I\u2019m grinning. Her body feels loose in my arms.</p><p>I lean over her and kiss her. It feels like relief.</p>",

The lights from the candles lining the wall are warm and dim, and the people are mostly hidden in shadows. I am not comfortable here. The music is loud and the people are talking over each other and I feel large, like there is not enough space for me. I am happier when we sleep outside. I like the quiet and complex sounds animals make when the sun goes down.</p><p>Taverns seemed easier when Molly was here.</p><p>Jester is leaned over the table and her eyes are lit up by flashes of candlelight as she grins at Caleb. I don\u2019t catch what she says, but I see Caleb press his lips together in both a grimace and a smile. One of the rings around Jester\u2019s horn is shining, like she just recently polished it.</p><p>I look away.</p><p>Beau is next to me and she is talking to Fjord. She says, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you anything.\u201d</p><p>Fjord says, \u201cI\u2019m not putting a bet on that, Beau.\u201d I take the clay mug full of warm ale in front of me off of the table and bring it to my lips as I watch Beau. When she speaks, her jaw tightens. Everything about her is lean and taut. I can tell she is almost always tense, her back muscles drawn together and her hand is clenched in a fist. This is Beau\u2019s natural state: defensive. Ready. I swallow some of my drink and it tastes like wheat.</p><p>I look up at her face again and she\u2019s looking at me. Her eyes are really blue. \u201cYasha?\u201d She says.</p><p>\u201cYes, Beau?\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2013you just have something\u2013\u201d I gesture at the side of my mouth in a brushing motion. Beau goes to wipe her face with the back of her hand but she\u2019s missing it, I think it\u2019s a bit of sauce, and I reach for her face without thinking and my thumb touches her lip and then her cheek and I rub it away.</p><p>Her eyes are open wide when she says, \u201cUm. Thanks, Yasha.\u201d She looks at the table.</p><p>Fjord is watching us from across the table. I notice that Caduceus is now looking, too. He makes me uneasy because I\u2019m not sure how to talk to him. I\u2019m afraid that he might say something I won\u2019t have a response for.</p><p>Beau slips away from the table, swinging her legs over the bench we sat on together with an ease I admire.</p><p>Caduceus is leaning forward with his head resting in his palm and his pink hair lies in front of his face, covering one of his eyes. \u201cInteresting.\u201d I meet his eyes for a second and he doesn\u2019t blink.</p><p>I turn and watch Beau as she weaves through the crowd towards the back of the room, where a bartender is pouring drinks from casks.</p><p>\u201cBeau was just tryin\u2019 to get me to bet her she could sleep with the bartender tonight.\u201d Fjord says. \u201cI told her that was a foolish idea, but looks like she\u2019s goin\u2019 for it.\u201d His voice has a little smile in it like he\u2019s amused but I don\u2019t really feel amused.</p><p>I sit up a little straighter and feel my brows furrow. Generally, I find Beau amusing, but I feel annoyance right now. I\u2019m annoyed with her.</p><p>Caduceus leans in closer and says, \u201cDoes that bother you, Yasha?\u201d</p><p>Fjord laughs and says, \u201cWhy would that bother Yasha? She knows how Beau is.\u201d</p><p>I look away from them, down the table at the rest of the group, hoping one of them might change the subject. Nott is laughing with her flask in hand and her mask is resting against her chest. Jester is gesturing wildly and Caleb has a small smile. None of them are paying attention to us.</p><p>I clear my throat and look back at Fjord and Caduceus. \u201cNo, I\u2019m definitely not bothered.\u201d I get up from the bench. \u201cExcuse me, I, um, I have a headache and I need to go to bed.\u201d The music had paused but now it is picking back up and a woman is singing.</p><p><i>In the dark town of Shady Grove on a Monday eve\u2013</i></p><p>I walk away from the table and move through the crowd. People move aside for me when they see me coming. I try not to look at Beau when I walk past her to the staircase at the back of the tavern, but I see her in my peripheral. She\u2019s leaning against the bar. I keep walking and now I\u2019m going up the stairs and I can\u2019t see her anymore.</p><p><i>I met a fair maid as lovely as you\u2019d believe\u2013</i></p><p>The hallway at the top of the stairs is well lit by torches and it\u2019s brighter than below. There are numbers painted on the doors. I realize that Jester has the keys for our rooms tonight.</p><p><i>She wore no jewels and her eyes were bright\u2013</i></p><p>I don\u2019t want to go back downstairs so I keep walking down the hallway. The din of laughter and conversation fades as I walk, though it never quite dies. There is a door at the very end of the hallway and I try the handle, hoping it might lead outside. It opens, and there is a small deck with a staircase beyond it.</p><p><i>Her hair as black as a moonless night\u2013</i></p><p>I go outside. The air is very cold and there are trees hanging over a path behind the tavern. A light wind blows through and the leaves rustle, sounding a little like the waves on the beach in Nicodranas. I shiver. I start to relax. I lean against the railing. Light escapes from the tavern windows beneath me, giving the plants beneath the trees a warm glow, like they are props on a stage.</p><p>It did bother me that Beau left to go chat with the bartender. I\u2019m sure Caduceus knew that, but Fjord is like me. Clueless.</p><p>I miss Molly. I\u2019m almost never not missing Molly, but right now I wish I could talk to him. \u201cWhat would you say?\u201d I ask the trees.</p><p>I picture him standing next to me, leaning over the railing. He has a wicked grin. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u00a0<i>really\u00a0</i>like that bratty girl, right?\u201d I speak for him, and I can almost remember how his mouth moved when he talked, how his lower lip got stuck behind his fangs on hard syllables.</p><p>I feel my mouth turn down and my eyes get hot for a second. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, Molly. She\u2019s changed. Everything has changed so much since you\u2019ve been gone.\u201d</p><p>His ghost disappears because I can\u2019t picture him here anymore. He could have grown with us. I don\u2019t know what type of person he could have become, and this is what really strikes my heart. He is frozen in time, in the dirt, and he does not get to redeem or create or learn anymore.</p><p>It is unfair.</p><p>I look up at the stars and let the air cool my head. I take a deep breath and let out a stammering exhale.</p><p>There is something specifically about Beauregard that makes me want to be around her. I like when she laughs and I like when she tries to look tough. I like the color of her eyes when we fight together. I don\u2019t know when it was that I started to like those things about her, but it was after Molly. After Darktow.</p><p>I \u00a0hear footsteps behind me and I instinctively place my hand on the hilt of my dagger, the one Caleb gave to me (\u201cFor the next time you give me a shave\u201d).</p><p>I turn and it\u2019s Beau. She\u2019s holding a key in her fingers and holding it out to me. Her face is covered in shadow so I can\u2019t make out her expression. \u201cJester said to take this to you.\u201d</p><p>I reach for it. \u201cWell\u2026 thank you,\u201d I say. \u201cHow\u2013how\u2019s it going in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNott got up on the table and started shouting, so I\u2019d say business as usual.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI meant with the bartender.\u201d</p><p>She sort of shrugs and looks at the ground. \u201cGood, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I tuck the key away and fold my arms across my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Nothing?\u201d She says, and she\u2019s looking me in the eyes now. I can tell because a little bit of starlight is reflecting off of her brown skin. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m not sure what to say. Something is starting to click into place. \u201cAre you angry with me, Beau?\u201d</p><p>She throws her hands up in an exaggerated motion. \u201cMaybe I am!\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to say something and then I stop. \u201cOh,\u201d is all I can think to reply.</p><p>Beau makes a low, rumbling noise and steps towards me. \u201cI\u2019m tired of this. Look, Yasha, do you want me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I surprise us both when I say it. My words come out in a little white cloud when they hit the cold air. \u201cI want you.\u201d It feels like a little wind has picked up inside my chest. The truth of it is making my skin buzz and I look away from Beau. \u201cBut I can\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>She places her hand on my cheek and it\u2019s so warm I flinch a little, and then her lips are pressed against mine. It\u2019s too much and not enough all at once and I think about pulling away but then I start to feel like I do when a fight starts.</p><p>I hear a crack of thunder in the distance and the hair on the back of my neck stands on end.</p><p>I put my hand on her face and I\u2019m kissing her back, pulling her towards me. I push her inside and against the wall of the hallway. Beau pulls her face away and says, \u201cI want you, too.\u201d She\u2019s grinning. I\u2019m grinning. Her body feels loose in my arms.</p><p>I lean over her and kiss her. It feels like relief.</p></p>",
