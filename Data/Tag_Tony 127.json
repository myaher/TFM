When Tony attempts to console his partner, Stephen (clearly delirious and 100% out of it) begins to beg Tony to kill him to put him out of his misery and pain, (oh, Stephen darling I am so sorry. You too Tony. I\u2019ll go repent in my corner)",
        "answer": "<p>Oh, my beloved monster Corner Anon strikes once again! And you left Stephen alive! You get a reprieve from your corner for that. \ud83e\udd23 You fill my inbox with so much beautiful angst and I don\u2019t think that I have ever given you a proper story in return. Until now. Enjoy a broken Stephen begging for death and Tony crying over him and desperately trying to save him from the horrors that lurk in his mind.</p><p>Warning: This is the ultra-angst version of Stephen\u2019s nightmares. (I\u2019ve already done a <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16296392&amp;t=ZjMyYjU4YmI0MDlkZTQwNDMwZDgwZDZlNzMyMDM0MDA5Y2E0NjM4YSw4MDEzMTgyOGI2NmE2MTQwYTZjNDgzMGUwOTExNWMzMTUzOWQyZWVk\">\u201ckinder\u201d version</a> of Stephen suffering from them and there\u2019ll be one more since I got another beauty of an ask and I just like to write about this scenario. Don\u2019t judge me. Please. Stephen will always end up in Tony\u2019s arms; I don\u2019t care how repetitive it is.) Just look at the prompt up there and the tags on AO3 and decide if you want to read something like this.

The chairs in the waiting area\nof the compound\u2019s med bay weren\u2019t the usual cheap plastic ones he remembered\nfrom the last time he had sat in a hospital waiting for news. </p><p>Shaking his\nhead again he squeezed his eyes shut to make the voices in his head go away.\nThey were too loud, too many and he was too afraid that they were right. </p><p><i>No</i>. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t\nlet himself go there. If he did all the tiny pieces that made up his soul that\nhe had held together for the past three hours would finally break and crumble\nand he <i>couldn\u2019t</i> \u2013 he didn\u2019t have the energy to pick them back up again.\nThere were more important things to focus on, like the heartbeat he could hear\nthrough closed doors ever so faintly. As long as it kept beating Peter would be\nstrong he vowed.</p><p>A heavy\nhand settled on his shoulder making him flinch. </p><p>The motion\nwas familiar but not the person it had come from. The feeling of the hand on\nhis skin was all <i>wrong, </i>the fingers not calloused enough to belong to\nthe person he wanted \u2013 <i>needed</i> \u2013 right now. The wrong man settled down in\none of the cushioned chairs and kept looking at him with a worried frown. It\nwas a wrong sigh he let out and the voice was wrong, too. </p><p><i>Wrongwrongwrong.</i></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nstill in your suit.\u201d </p><p>The\nteenager heard the silent suggestion that swung in the statement but the mere thought\nof leaving left a bitter taste in his mouth and made his heart clench painfully\nin his chest, so he simply nodded and continued fidgeting with the mask in his\nhands and shuffling his upper body until his shoulder was free of the man\u2019s\ntouch. </p><p><i>Wrong.</i></p><p>Rhodey let\nhis hand slid down his arms, leaving goosebumps in its wake that were covered\nby the red and blue suit. He didn\u2019t move it, though, simply let it drop down\ninto his own lap again. \u201cHave you called your aunt?\u201d </p><p>He gave a\nsharp nod. \u201cI told her I\u2019ll be staying here,\u201d he felt compelled to add, his\ntone challenging the other superhero to object, to tell him off. He was\nsurprised when the older man simply cocked his head to the side and continued to\nwatch him intently. \u201cI just \u2013\u201c He crumbled a little under the patient gaze. \u201cI\njust can\u2019t leave him, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d </p><p>Peter met\nhis gaze again and for the first time he realized just how tired Rhodey looked.\nAlmost as tired as Peter felt himself. </p><p>His entire\nbody was tense and the worry seemed permanently etched into the wrinkles on his\nface. He recognized the look, knew exactly what it felt like. Rhodey really did\nunderstand. He figured he must have spent most of his life worrying about Tony\nand the thought made the young vigilante feel nauseous. </p><p>\u201cBut we\ncan\u2019t really do anything for him right now,\u201d Rhodey told him matter-of-factly,\nvoice calm and collected and gentle. \u201cAnd I know for a fact that they won\u2019t let\nyou into his room looking as filthy as you do. Something about open wounds and\ndirt, hygiene they call it, I think.\u201d He cracked a smile but it seemed forced\nat best. Still, Peter appreciated it. </p><p>He just\nreally didn\u2019t want to go. </p><p>Rhodey\nsensed that and with a motion too quickly for his tired brain to keep up with,\nhe pulled something out from \u2013 from where exactly? Behind his back? The chair\nbeside him? Did it matter? </p><p>A pile of\nclothes landed in his arms and instinctively he grabbed to hold them. His\nfavorite pajama pants and one of his science pun t-shirts and a dark red hoodie\nhe had never seen before. It was soft. He frowned but before he could open his\nmouth to ask, Rhodey explained. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nTony\u2019s. Was his favorite back in the day. He\u2019s rarely wearing it outside\nanymore but I\u2019m pretty sure he still wears it at home. I thought you would\nappreciate it.\u201d </p><p>He did. Curling\nhis hand around the soft fabric, he felt gratitude spread in his chest, fuzzy\nand slowly melting the fear that had taken his heart hostage. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna\nbe okay, right?\u201d he croaked. Of course he\u2019d already asked that and the doctor had\nreassured him but he needed to hear it from someone who was just as scared as\nhe was, just as shaken because they knew what was at stake.</p><p>\u201cOf course\nhe is,\u201d Rhodey scoffed fondly, and his wet eyes almost didn\u2019t betray his light\ntone, \u201cYou know how it is, bad weeds grow tall.\u201d </p><p>Something\nsimilar to a laugh slipped passed his dry lips before he conceded with a huff. \u201cFine,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cBut F.R.I.D.A.Y. is gonna call me the second there are any news whatsoever.\u201d\n</p><p>When he\npushed himself up from the chair he felt a lot older than sixteen with all his\njoints creaking and cracking from having been curled up in one position for too\nlong. His heart, too, felt older than it had just this morning.</p><p>As much as he\nhated being away from the action, if you could call the deserted waiting room\nthat, he had to admit that the shower did wonders on his tense shoulders. The dried\ntear tracks on his cheeks were slowly fading when he let the hot water pour\nover his face. He just had to keep his mind busy because the second he didn\u2019t,\nhe was back <i>there </i>and he was holding on to Tony\u2019s lifeless body and he\ncouldn\u2019t stand picturing the man like that. </p><p>Tony was\nvibrant. Always with a sarcastic quip on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes\nwhen they met Peter\u2019s. He was strong and smart and <i>alive</i>. He was a god\ndamn superhero.</p><p>Peter\nblinked the tears away that burned in his eyes and mixed with the water until\nhe couldn\u2019t tell which was which anymore.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><i>\u201cGreat\njob, underoos. One down, one to go,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounded through the comm and\nhe grinned at the praise as he shot out a web at the Ironman suit that was\nflying past him. As soon as the web attached itself to the armor he felt the\nstrain on his shoulder when his self-designed material stretched and then he already\ntook off, tagging along on the flight. </i></p><p><i>He loved\nflying. Loved the exhilarating feeling of his heart dropping to his stomach. He\nknew without the shadow of a doubt that he was safe here. He was with Tony after\nall. </i></p><p><i>\u201cKids\nthese days,\u201d he heard his mentor mutter in mock annoyance, \u201cToo lazy to web\ntheir own way down to the fight.\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u201cGotta keep you on your toes, don\u2019t I?\u201d he\nquipped back before shooting out another web and leaving the billionaire\u2019s side\nto land on the side of a nearby building gracefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Mister\nStark?\u201d he asked, narrowing his eyes at the huge thing (honestly, he wasn\u2019t\nsure as what to classify the weird metallic body that was currently out for their\nblood). </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s\nthe moment War Machine joined them, flying up in to hover next to Iron-Man,\nblasters out and ready to, well, blast. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna kick some ass is what\nwe\u2019re gonna do.\u201d </i></p><p><i>The last\nthing he heard before Rhodey started firing was Tony\u2019s carefree laughter in his\near. </i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><hr><p>He had just\nstepped out of the shower when F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed him that Tony was out of\nsurgery. It didn\u2019t take him more than three minutes until he was back in the\nmed bay, pants on the wrong way around and hoodie barely pulled over his head.</p><p>Looking\nlike the mess he felt, wet curls hanging in his face and almost tripping over\nhis feet, he barreled into the room and \u2013 stopped and stared. </p><p>The sight\nthat greeted him felt like a punch to the stomach and knocked the air out of his\nlungs, making him stumble. </p><p>Tony seemed\nto be swallowed up by the big bed, tubes sticking out of various parts of his\nbody. He took a tentative step closer but not too close, too scared to\naccidentally touch some of the wires and mess something important up. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s \u2013\u201c he\nstammered, \u201cIs he \u2013?\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\nfine.\u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice was gentle but firm, demanding attention that Peter\ndidn\u2019t have to spare. His gaze seemed permanently stuck on the slight rise and\nfall of his mentor\u2019s chest. </p><p><i>Breathing\nmeant alive. They could work with alive. An alive Tony would fight his way back\nto them. </i></p><p>Rhodey\nstood up from the chair next to the bed, slowly approaching Peter until he was\nright beside him. Again, the hand settled on his shoulder, pulling him back from\nthe spiraling thoughts in his mind, grounding him in the moment. </p><p>Peter\nlooked up, Rhodey\u2019s face blurry through the veil of tears that he couldn\u2019t\nforce back. \u201cI should\u2019ve \u2013 I should\u2019ve done <i>something</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know\nas well as I do that there was nothing you could\u2019ve done.\u201d </p><p>Deep down\nhe knew that he should have found a way. </p><p>\u201cHe knew\nwhat he was doing and he knew the consequences but, most importantly, he knew\nwhat would happen if he didn\u2019t act.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><hr><p><i>\u201cWell,\nthis is very not good.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t say, platypus.\u201d Tony\u2019s eye roll was audible over the comms and if Peter\nhadn\u2019t been so focused on the thing they were fighting getting ready to fire a\nblast of </i>something\nvery<i> </i>not good<i> into a nearby skyscraper he might have even cracked a\nsmile. As it was, he was otherwise preoccupied. </i></p><p><i>He was\nso far out of his wheel house right now, he realized, when he swung to another\nbuilding closer to the two other heroes. \u201cWhat are we gonna do, Mister Stark?\u201d\nBecause surely his mentor knew what to do. He always knew what to do. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAbout\nthat \u2013\u201c </i></p><p><i>It all\nhappened so fast that Peter barely had time to process Rhodey\u2019s scream in his\near before Tony had flown in the way of the monster, putting himself between\nthe monster and its target and \u2013</i></p><p><i>When the\ngreen blast hit the arc reactor Peter\u2019s heart plummeted. </i></p><p><i>Hope\nflared in his chest when Iron- Man somehow reversed the fire power, hitting the\nalien being that burst into a million pieces. But then he didn\u2019t reply and\nsimply fell. </i></p><p><i>He fell\nand fell and fell and then he stopped.</i></p><p><br/></p><hr><p>Once Rhodey\nhad left it took him a while until he dared to move closer to the bed.</p><p>Tony looked so fragile, <i>broken</i>, and as\nmuch as he couldn\u2019t bear to see him like that, Peter found that he was\nincapable of averting his eyes. Underneath all the ugly bruises he was still so\nundeniably alive and that was all that mattered, all he let himself focus on to\nkeep his mind from spiraling.</p><p>Eventually he settled into the seat Rhodey had\nvacated and gingerly took hold of his mentor\u2019s hand, careful to avoid any and\nall wires he was attached to but especially the perfusion pump supplying him\nwith a steady stream of pain meds. He seemed to need it. </p><p>The older man\u2019s face was calm, the anesthesia\nworking its magic in relaxing his muscles and keeping the pain at bay. It\nseemed wrong, though, to see the expressive face of Tony Stark so devoid of any\nemotion and tension. Only a few wrinkles remained, especially the frowny ones\nbut Peter could make out the crow\u2019s feet and lines around his mouth, too, that\ntold a story of an easier time with laughter and movie nights instead of bloody\nhands and hospital beds.</p><p>The monitor was showing him the ECG recording\nand he let the steady beeping lull his unsettled thoughts until he was calm\nenough to really take in the injuries of the man that made up half of his small\nmake-shift family. </p><p>The oxygen mask on the billionaire\u2019s face was\nfogged with his breaths (<i>he was breathing</i>) but it seemed to be working\nbecause the pulse oximeter on his left hand recorded an oxygen saturation of\n100 percent. </p><p>Peter let out a small breath. </p><p>His blood pressure was steady, albeit a little\nlow with 110 to 60 but so much better than when \u2013</p><p>The stiff\nneck Tony was wearing looked uncomfortable but he didn\u2019t seem to mind so Peter\ntried to be okay with how weirdly rigid and unmovable it made the man look.</p><p>His eyes\nflickered over the case report on the nightstand. </p><p><b>Fracture\nof both anterior and posterior arch of C1 </b></p><p><b>Type III\nfracture of C2, stable, no indication for surgical treatment. </b></p><p><i>Stable</i>. He held onto that when he skimmed over\nthe rest of the text. </p><p><b>Type II\nspleen rupture</b></p><p><b>Fractured\n4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> left and 2nd right rib; 3rd rib broken\nbilaterally after CPR by first responder \u2013</b></p><p><br/></p><hr><p><i>Peter\nreached him as soon as he could but it was still too late. Tony wasn\u2019t moving,\nwasn\u2019t responding, wasn\u2019t \u2013 </i></p><p><i>\u201cKaren,\u201d\nhe choked out, crawling to the lifeless armor on hands and knees, \u201cCan you get\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. to open the suit?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Not a\nsecond later the pieces of the suit retracted, revealing his mentor\u2019s beaten\nform. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y. detected fractures of the upper cervical spine. It is\nrecommend to move the patient\u2019s neck as little as possible to not risk severing\nthe spinal cord.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThen\nwhy didn\u2019t she just keep the armor on?\u201d he spit out, thoughts racing and suited\nhand pressed against his masked mouth. He couldn\u2019t look at this, he couldn\u2019t\nbreathe through this. He couldn\u2019t \u2013</i></p><p><i>\u201cMister\nStark is in immediate need of CPR.\u201d </i></p><p><i>No. </i></p><p><i>He\ncouldn\u2019t do that. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMister\nRhodes!\u201d he managed to call out to the superhero still flying through the air\nto keep the collateral damage as low as possible, \u201cYou need to \u2013\u201c</i></p><p><i>The\ncommanding voice that replied was tense and not at all reminiscent of the\nplayful teasing just minutes earlier. \u201cI can\u2019t, Pete. You gotta do it. You know\nhow to do CPR, right?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Of\ncourse he knew CPR. He knew the steps, knew the moves but \u2013 </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m \u2013\nI\u2019m too strong,\u201d he whispered even as he pulled up his mask halfway and started\nkneeling at his mentor\u2019s head to get a better angle, \u201cI can\u2019t control my\nstrength \u2013 I\u2019m gonna \u2013 I could kill him!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Still,\nhe started pressing down.</i></p><p><i>When he\nheard the first rib crack, Peter cried out in pain but didn\u2019t stop. He bent\ndown, tilting the man\u2019s head as carefully as he could and breathed for him twice\nbefore continuing to press down on his ribcage. </i></p><p><i>Another\ncrack. A broken rib. And Peter couldn\u2019t see through the tears that were running\ndown his cheeks and he couldn\u2019t breathe but he struggled through the panic\nsealing his lungs because Tony needed him to breathe for him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHeartbeat\ndetected.\u201d </i></p><p><br/></p><hr><p>Beep, beep,\nbeep, beep. </p><p>His heart\nwas still beating. It was still pumping blood into his circulation, was still supplying\nhis cells with oxygen and was still keeping him alive. It was a steady\nheartbeat and it felt strong when it pulsated against Peter\u2019s fingers that were\npressed to his mentor\u2019s wrist. </p><p>Thud, thud,\nthud, thud.</p><p>He could\nhear it, too. If he concentrated hard enough he could make out not only the thud\nbut also the blood streaming through ventricle and atrium. He heard the valves\nopen and close and the soft swoosh when the blood fell back against closed\nvalves. </p><p>Still, he\ncouldn\u2019t forget the utter silence that had greeted him earlier. The memory of\nholding the lifeless man seemed to have been permanently etched into his brain.\nAn image so horribly familiar that it made him feel sick and scared as if he\nwas the small little boy again, begging for help. </p><p><i>Please\ndon\u2019t leave me. </i></p><p>Peter was\nmoving before he had consciously formed the thought and it made him stop in his\ntracks. Was he allowed to? The doctor had said to watch out for the wires and\nto be careful with his ribs and neck. But maybe if he was extra cautious it\nwould be okay? </p><p>Almost in\nslow motion he pushed the cables and tubes aside carefully and moved to sit on\nthe bed. Tony was laying a little more to the left side of the bed and so the\nteenager very deliberately draped himself on his mentor\u2019s right side until he\nwas curled around the man without jostling him too much. </p><p>He wound\nhis arm around his head gingerly and dropped his face to rest in the sweaty mob\nof hair. He breathed in the familiar scent that he could make out beneath all\nthe dust and dirt and blood and sweat. He breathed in Tony and, ever so slowly,\nhe started to relax. </p><p><br/></p><hr><p><i>\u201cETA 3\nminutes.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Three\nmore minutes of Peter holding on to his mentor\u2019s head, too scared to move, too\nscared to do much of anything but let his body shake with silent sobs and keep\nlistening for that heartbeat that was still fluttering in his chest much too\nweakly for his taste. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s\ngonna be okay.\u201d For a lack of better option he started talking to the\nunresponsive man whose head was resting on his thighs and who didn\u2019t look like\nhe was ever going to wake up again. But his heart was beating so he was going\nto wake up. He </i>had<i>\nto wake up. </i></p><p><i>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.\ncould probably fly you home in the suit but we don\u2019t wanna risk \u2013\u201c severing\nyour spinal cord \u201c \u2013 it, so we\u2019re waiting for the ambulance. It should be here\nany minute now. You\u2019re gonna be fine, right? I mean, you always said you\u2019d\nprobably die of something stupid like tripping over Dum-E not on the\nbattlefield. You promised not to die before my wedding.\u201d </i></p><p><i>It was\nstupid and childish yet he couldn\u2019t help but beg. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\ncan\u2019t die. You were gonna teach me how to build an arch reactor and you\npromised to watch the new Star Wars movie with me the second it comes out. We already\nplanned our costumes, remember?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Suddenly\nthe Kylo Ren and Han Solo dress up they had planned seemed so inconsequential\nand trivial. He could\u2019ve spend the time arguing about Kylo\u2019s true feelings\ntelling his mentor how much he appreciated him. He should\u2019ve told him he loved\nhim instead of disagreeing over his breakfast choices. He should\u2019ve held on to\nhim more when he had the chance. He should\u2019ve \u2013 </i></p><p><i>He\nwould, he vowed silently, he would tell him. </i></p><p><br/></p><hr><p>\u201cI love\nyou,\u201d he whispered, the words he had never directed at him before oddly\nfamiliar on his tongue. \u201cJust, please wake up so I can tell you in person.\u201d\nBefore he thought better of it he leaned forward, pressed a gentle kiss to\nTony\u2019s forehead and rested his own against it. </p><p>Now that he\nwas surrounded by the warmth of his \u2013 his <i>person</i> and could feel his\nchest moving with every breath and could hear his heart beating steadily he\nrealized just how tired he was. He could rest for a bit, right? Tony surely\nwouldn\u2019t mind and he would tell the nurse where to shove it should she jostle\nPeter\u2026 yeah\u2026 he\u2019d just rest his eyes a little. Just for a few minutes. </p><p>His eyes\nslowly started to drop close, succumbing to the exhaustion that seemed to have\nsettled deep into his bones.</p><p>Of course\nTony took that moment to blink blearily, almost making Peter jolt in surprise. </p><p>\u201cLove ya,\ntoo, kiddo,\u201d he slurred, not really focusing on anything in particular, \u201cShould\nknow that.\u201d </p><p>And,\nwithout another word, the older man wrapped his right arm more firmly around\nhis prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and fell right back asleep with a soft snore. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Tony spent\nalmost a week in his bed in med bay until the doctors were certain he would be\nable to move his neck without danger of becoming paraplegic and Peter came to\nsee him every day, spending most of his time in the small, barren room. He\nwould bring his homework after school and once he was done with it they would\nwatch another movie or start on another TV show. Sometimes Rhodey or Pepper or\nMay would join them and bring them a home cooked dinner. Sometimes they just\nmunched on the pizzas F.R.I.D.A.Y. ordered. </p><p>Sometimes\nPeter would fall asleep curled around Tony and sometimes May would threaten him\nwith grounding if he didn\u2019t come back home to sleep in his own bed at some point\nbut <i>every time</i>, before he left, Peter would lean down to Tony and press\na kiss to his forehead gently. He would tell him he loved him and his mentor\nwould say it back. </p><p>He never\nwould have to be scared of not having said enough when he still had the time\never again. </p>",

He didn\u2019t move it, though, simply let it drop down\ninto his own lap again. \u201cHave you called your aunt?\u201d </p><p>He gave a\nsharp nod. \u201cI told her I\u2019ll be staying here,\u201d he felt compelled to add, his\ntone challenging the other superhero to object, to tell him off. He was\nsurprised when the older man simply cocked his head to the side and continued to\nwatch him intently. \u201cI just \u2013\u201c He crumbled a little under the patient gaze. \u201cI\njust can\u2019t leave him, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d </p><p>Peter met\nhis gaze again and for the first time he realized just how tired Rhodey looked.\nAlmost as tired as Peter felt himself. </p><p>His entire\nbody was tense and the worry seemed permanently etched into the wrinkles on his\nface. He recognized the look, knew exactly what it felt like. Rhodey really did\nunderstand. He figured he must have spent most of his life worrying about Tony\nand the thought made the young vigilante feel nauseous. </p><p>\u201cBut we\ncan\u2019t really do anything for him right now,\u201d Rhodey told him matter-of-factly,\nvoice calm and collected and gentle. \u201cAnd I know for a fact that they won\u2019t let\nyou into his room looking as filthy as you do. Something about open wounds and\ndirt, hygiene they call it, I think.\u201d He cracked a smile but it seemed forced\nat best. Still, Peter appreciated it. </p><p>He just\nreally didn\u2019t want to go. </p><p>Rhodey\nsensed that and with a motion too quickly for his tired brain to keep up with,\nhe pulled something out from \u2013 from where exactly? Behind his back? The chair\nbeside him? Did it matter? </p><p>A pile of\nclothes landed in his arms and instinctively he grabbed to hold them. His\nfavorite pajama pants and one of his science pun t-shirts and a dark red hoodie\nhe had never seen before. It was soft. He frowned but before he could open his\nmouth to ask, Rhodey explained. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nTony\u2019s. Was his favorite back in the day. He\u2019s rarely wearing it outside\nanymore but I\u2019m pretty sure he still wears it at home. I thought you would\nappreciate it.\u201d </p><p>He did. Curling\nhis hand around the soft fabric, he felt gratitude spread in his chest, fuzzy\nand slowly melting the fear that had taken his heart hostage. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna\nbe okay, right?\u201d he croaked. Of course he\u2019d already asked that and the doctor had\nreassured him but he needed to hear it from someone who was just as scared as\nhe was, just as shaken because they knew what was at stake.</p><p>\u201cOf course\nhe is,\u201d Rhodey scoffed fondly, and his wet eyes almost didn\u2019t betray his light\ntone, \u201cYou know how it is, bad weeds grow tall.\u201d </p><p>Something\nsimilar to a laugh slipped passed his dry lips before he conceded with a huff. \u201cFine,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cBut F.R.I.D.A.Y. is gonna call me the second there are any news whatsoever.\u201d\n</p><p>When he\npushed himself up from the chair he felt a lot older than sixteen with all his\njoints creaking and cracking from having been curled up in one position for too\nlong. His heart, too, felt older than it had just this morning.</p><p>As much as he\nhated being away from the action, if you could call the deserted waiting room\nthat, he had to admit that the shower did wonders on his tense shoulders. The dried\ntear tracks on his cheeks were slowly fading when he let the hot water pour\nover his face. He just had to keep his mind busy because the second he didn\u2019t,\nhe was back <i>there </i>and he was holding on to Tony\u2019s lifeless body and he\ncouldn\u2019t stand picturing the man like that. </p><p>Tony was\nvibrant. Always with a sarcastic quip on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes\nwhen they met Peter\u2019s. He was strong and smart and <i>alive</i>. He was a god\ndamn superhero.</p><p>Peter\nblinked the tears away that burned in his eyes and mixed with the water until\nhe couldn\u2019t tell which was which anymore.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>\u201cGreat\njob, underoos. One down, one to go,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice sounded through the comm and\nhe grinned at the praise as he shot out a web at the Ironman suit that was\nflying past him. As soon as the web attached itself to the armor he felt the\nstrain on his shoulder when his self-designed material stretched and then he already\ntook off, tagging along on the flight. </i></p><p><i>He loved\nflying. Loved the exhilarating feeling of his heart dropping to his stomach. He\nknew without the shadow of a doubt that he was safe here. He was with Tony after\nall. </i></p><p><i>\u201cKids\nthese days,\u201d he heard his mentor mutter in mock annoyance, \u201cToo lazy to web\ntheir own way down to the fight.\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u201cGotta keep you on your toes, don\u2019t I?\u201d he\nquipped back before shooting out another web and leaving the billionaire\u2019s side\nto land on the side of a nearby building gracefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Mister\nStark?\u201d he asked, narrowing his eyes at the huge thing (honestly, he wasn\u2019t\nsure as what to classify the weird metallic body that was currently out for their\nblood). </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s\nthe moment War Machine joined them, flying up in to hover next to Iron-Man,\nblasters out and ready to, well, blast. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna kick some ass is what\nwe\u2019re gonna do.\u201d </i></p><p><i>The last\nthing he heard before Rhodey started firing was Tony\u2019s carefree laughter in his\near. </i></p><p><i><br></i></p><hr><p>He had just\nstepped out of the shower when F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed him that Tony was out of\nsurgery. It didn\u2019t take him more than three minutes until he was back in the\nmed bay, pants on the wrong way around and hoodie barely pulled over his head.</p><p>Looking\nlike the mess he felt, wet curls hanging in his face and almost tripping over\nhis feet, he barreled into the room and \u2013 stopped and stared. </p><p>The sight\nthat greeted him felt like a punch to the stomach and knocked the air out of his\nlungs, making him stumble. </p><p>Tony seemed\nto be swallowed up by the big bed, tubes sticking out of various parts of his\nbody. He took a tentative step closer but not too close, too scared to\naccidentally touch some of the wires and mess something important up. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s \u2013\u201c he\nstammered, \u201cIs he \u2013?\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\nfine.\u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice was gentle but firm, demanding attention that Peter\ndidn\u2019t have to spare. His gaze seemed permanently stuck on the slight rise and\nfall of his mentor\u2019s chest. </p><p><i>Breathing\nmeant alive. They could work with alive. An alive Tony would fight his way back\nto them. </i></p><p>Rhodey\nstood up from the chair next to the bed, slowly approaching Peter until he was\nright beside him. Again, the hand settled on his shoulder, pulling him back from\nthe spiraling thoughts in his mind, grounding him in the moment. </p><p>Peter\nlooked up, Rhodey\u2019s face blurry through the veil of tears that he couldn\u2019t\nforce back. \u201cI should\u2019ve \u2013 I should\u2019ve done <i>something</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know\nas well as I do that there was nothing you could\u2019ve done.\u201d </p><p>Deep down\nhe knew that he should have found a way. </p><p>\u201cHe knew\nwhat he was doing and he knew the consequences but, most importantly, he knew\nwhat would happen if he didn\u2019t act.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>\u201cWell,\nthis is very not good.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t say, platypus.\u201d Tony\u2019s eye roll was audible over the comms and if Peter\nhadn\u2019t been so focused on the thing they were fighting getting ready to fire a\nblast of </i>something\nvery<i> </i>not good<i> into a nearby skyscraper he might have even cracked a\nsmile. As it was, he was otherwise preoccupied. </i></p><p><i>He was\nso far out of his wheel house right now, he realized, when he swung to another\nbuilding closer to the two other heroes. \u201cWhat are we gonna do, Mister Stark?\u201d\nBecause surely his mentor knew what to do. He always knew what to do. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAbout\nthat \u2013\u201c </i></p><p><i>It all\nhappened so fast that Peter barely had time to process Rhodey\u2019s scream in his\near before Tony had flown in the way of the monster, putting himself between\nthe monster and its target and \u2013</i></p><p><i>When the\ngreen blast hit the arc reactor Peter\u2019s heart plummeted. </i></p><p><i>Hope\nflared in his chest when Iron- Man somehow reversed the fire power, hitting the\nalien being that burst into a million pieces. But then he didn\u2019t reply and\nsimply fell. </i></p><p><i>He fell\nand fell and fell and then he stopped.</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p>Once Rhodey\nhad left it took him a while until he dared to move closer to the bed.</p><p>Tony looked so fragile, <i>broken</i>, and as\nmuch as he couldn\u2019t bear to see him like that, Peter found that he was\nincapable of averting his eyes. Underneath all the ugly bruises he was still so\nundeniably alive and that was all that mattered, all he let himself focus on to\nkeep his mind from spiraling.</p><p>Eventually he settled into the seat Rhodey had\nvacated and gingerly took hold of his mentor\u2019s hand, careful to avoid any and\nall wires he was attached to but especially the perfusion pump supplying him\nwith a steady stream of pain meds. He seemed to need it. </p><p>The older man\u2019s face was calm, the anesthesia\nworking its magic in relaxing his muscles and keeping the pain at bay. It\nseemed wrong, though, to see the expressive face of Tony Stark so devoid of any\nemotion and tension. Only a few wrinkles remained, especially the frowny ones\nbut Peter could make out the crow\u2019s feet and lines around his mouth, too, that\ntold a story of an easier time with laughter and movie nights instead of bloody\nhands and hospital beds.</p><p>The monitor was showing him the ECG recording\nand he let the steady beeping lull his unsettled thoughts until he was calm\nenough to really take in the injuries of the man that made up half of his small\nmake-shift family. </p><p>The oxygen mask on the billionaire\u2019s face was\nfogged with his breaths (<i>he was breathing</i>) but it seemed to be working\nbecause the pulse oximeter on his left hand recorded an oxygen saturation of\n100 percent. </p><p>Peter let out a small breath. </p><p>His blood pressure was steady, albeit a little\nlow with 110 to 60 but so much better than when \u2013</p><p>The stiff\nneck Tony was wearing looked uncomfortable but he didn\u2019t seem to mind so Peter\ntried to be okay with how weirdly rigid and unmovable it made the man look.</p><p>His eyes\nflickered over the case report on the nightstand. </p><p><b>Fracture\nof both anterior and posterior arch of C1 </b></p><p><b>Type III\nfracture of C2, stable, no indication for surgical treatment. </b></p><p><i>Stable</i>.

He bent\ndown, tilting the man\u2019s head as carefully as he could and breathed for him twice\nbefore continuing to press down on his ribcage. </i></p><p><i>Another\ncrack. A broken rib. And Peter couldn\u2019t see through the tears that were running\ndown his cheeks and he couldn\u2019t breathe but he struggled through the panic\nsealing his lungs because Tony needed him to breathe for him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHeartbeat\ndetected.\u201d </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p>Beep, beep,\nbeep, beep. </p><p>His heart\nwas still beating. It was still pumping blood into his circulation, was still supplying\nhis cells with oxygen and was still keeping him alive. It was a steady\nheartbeat and it felt strong when it pulsated against Peter\u2019s fingers that were\npressed to his mentor\u2019s wrist. </p><p>Thud, thud,\nthud, thud.</p><p>He could\nhear it, too. If he concentrated hard enough he could make out not only the thud\nbut also the blood streaming through ventricle and atrium. He heard the valves\nopen and close and the soft swoosh when the blood fell back against closed\nvalves. </p><p>Still, he\ncouldn\u2019t forget the utter silence that had greeted him earlier. The memory of\nholding the lifeless man seemed to have been permanently etched into his brain.\nAn image so horribly familiar that it made him feel sick and scared as if he\nwas the small little boy again, begging for help. </p><p><i>Please\ndon\u2019t leave me. </i></p><p>Peter was\nmoving before he had consciously formed the thought and it made him stop in his\ntracks. Was he allowed to? The doctor had said to watch out for the wires and\nto be careful with his ribs and neck. But maybe if he was extra cautious it\nwould be okay? </p><p>Almost in\nslow motion he pushed the cables and tubes aside carefully and moved to sit on\nthe bed. Tony was laying a little more to the left side of the bed and so the\nteenager very deliberately draped himself on his mentor\u2019s right side until he\nwas curled around the man without jostling him too much. </p><p>He wound\nhis arm around his head gingerly and dropped his face to rest in the sweaty mob\nof hair. He breathed in the familiar scent that he could make out beneath all\nthe dust and dirt and blood and sweat. He breathed in Tony and, ever so slowly,\nhe started to relax. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>\u201cETA 3\nminutes.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Three\nmore minutes of Peter holding on to his mentor\u2019s head, too scared to move, too\nscared to do much of anything but let his body shake with silent sobs and keep\nlistening for that heartbeat that was still fluttering in his chest much too\nweakly for his taste. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s\ngonna be okay.\u201d For a lack of better option he started talking to the\nunresponsive man whose head was resting on his thighs and who didn\u2019t look like\nhe was ever going to wake up again. But his heart was beating so he was going\nto wake up. He </i>had<i>\nto wake up. </i></p><p><i>\u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.\ncould probably fly you home in the suit but we don\u2019t wanna risk \u2013\u201c severing\nyour spinal cord \u201c \u2013 it, so we\u2019re waiting for the ambulance. It should be here\nany minute now. You\u2019re gonna be fine, right? I mean, you always said you\u2019d\nprobably die of something stupid like tripping over Dum-E not on the\nbattlefield. You promised not to die before my wedding.\u201d </i></p><p><i>It was\nstupid and childish yet he couldn\u2019t help but beg. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\ncan\u2019t die.

We already\nplanned our costumes, remember?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Suddenly\nthe Kylo Ren and Han Solo dress up they had planned seemed so inconsequential\nand trivial. He could\u2019ve spend the time arguing about Kylo\u2019s true feelings\ntelling his mentor how much he appreciated him. He should\u2019ve told him he loved\nhim instead of disagreeing over his breakfast choices. He should\u2019ve held on to\nhim more when he had the chance. He should\u2019ve \u2013 </i></p><p><i>He\nwould, he vowed silently, he would tell him. </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p>\u201cI love\nyou,\u201d he whispered, the words he had never directed at him before oddly\nfamiliar on his tongue. \u201cJust, please wake up so I can tell you in person.\u201d\nBefore he thought better of it he leaned forward, pressed a gentle kiss to\nTony\u2019s forehead and rested his own against it. </p><p>Now that he\nwas surrounded by the warmth of his \u2013 his <i>person</i> and could feel his\nchest moving with every breath and could hear his heart beating steadily he\nrealized just how tired he was. He could rest for a bit, right? Tony surely\nwouldn\u2019t mind and he would tell the nurse where to shove it should she jostle\nPeter\u2026 yeah\u2026 he\u2019d just rest his eyes a little. Just for a few minutes. </p><p>His eyes\nslowly started to drop close, succumbing to the exhaustion that seemed to have\nsettled deep into his bones.</p><p>Of course\nTony took that moment to blink blearily, almost making Peter jolt in surprise. </p><p>\u201cLove ya,\ntoo, kiddo,\u201d he slurred, not really focusing on anything in particular, \u201cShould\nknow that.\u201d </p><p>And,\nwithout another word, the older man wrapped his right arm more firmly around\nhis prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and fell right back asleep with a soft snore. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Tony spent\nalmost a week in his bed in med bay until the doctors were certain he would be\nable to move his neck without danger of becoming paraplegic and Peter came to\nsee him every day, spending most of his time in the small, barren room. He\nwould bring his homework after school and once he was done with it they would\nwatch another movie or start on another TV show. Sometimes Rhodey or Pepper or\nMay would join them and bring them a home cooked dinner. Sometimes they just\nmunched on the pizzas F.R.I.D.A.Y. ordered. </p><p>Sometimes\nPeter would fall asleep curled around Tony and sometimes May would threaten him\nwith grounding if he didn\u2019t come back home to sleep in his own bed at some point\nbut <i>every time</i>, before he left, Peter would lean down to Tony and press\na kiss to his forehead gently. He would tell him he loved him and his mentor\nwould say it back. </p><p>He never\nwould have to be scared of not having said enough when he still had the time\never again. </p>",

As long as it kept beating Peter would be\nstrong he vowed.</p><p>A heavy\nhand settled on his shoulder making him flinch. </p><p>The motion\nwas familiar but not the person it had come from. The feeling of the hand on\nhis skin was all <i>wrong, </i>the fingers not calloused enough to belong to\nthe person he wanted \u2013 <i>needed</i> \u2013 right now. The wrong man settled down in\none of the cushioned chairs and kept looking at him with a worried frown. It\nwas a wrong sigh he let out and the voice was wrong, too. </p><p><i>Wrongwrongwrong.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nstill in your suit.\u201d </p><p>The\nteenager heard the silent suggestion that swung in the statement but the mere thought\nof leaving left a bitter taste in his mouth and made his heart clench painfully\nin his chest, so he simply nodded and continued fidgeting with the mask in his\nhands and shuffling his upper body until his shoulder was free of the man\u2019s\ntouch. </p><p><i>Wrong.</i></p><p>Rhodey let\nhis hand slid down his arms, leaving goosebumps in its wake that were covered\nby the red and blue suit. He didn\u2019t move it, though, simply let it drop down\ninto his own lap again. \u201cHave you called your aunt?\u201d </p><p>He gave a\nsharp nod. \u201cI told her I\u2019ll be staying here,\u201d he felt compelled to add, his\ntone challenging the other superhero to object, to tell him off. He was\nsurprised when the older man simply cocked his head to the side and continued to\nwatch him intently. \u201cI just \u2013\u201c He crumbled a little under the patient gaze. \u201cI\njust can\u2019t leave him, you know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d </p><p>Peter met\nhis gaze again and for the first time he realized just how tired Rhodey looked.\nAlmost as tired as Peter felt himself. </p><p>His entire\nbody was tense and the worry seemed permanently etched into the wrinkles on his\nface. He recognized the look, knew exactly what it felt like. Rhodey really did\nunderstand. He figured he must have spent most of his life worrying about Tony\nand the thought made the young vigilante feel nauseous. </p><p>\u201cBut we\ncan\u2019t really do anything for him right now,\u201d Rhodey told him matter-of-factly,\nvoice calm and collected and gentle. \u201cAnd I know for a fact that they won\u2019t let\nyou into his room looking as filthy as you do. Something about open wounds and\ndirt, hygiene they call it, I think.\u201d He cracked a smile but it seemed forced\nat best. Still, Peter appreciated it. </p><p>He just\nreally didn\u2019t want to go. </p><p>Rhodey\nsensed that and with a motion too quickly for his tired brain to keep up with,\nhe pulled something out from \u2013 from where exactly? Behind his back? The chair\nbeside him? Did it matter? </p><p>A pile of\nclothes landed in his arms and instinctively he grabbed to hold them. His\nfavorite pajama pants and one of his science pun t-shirts and a dark red hoodie\nhe had never seen before. It was soft. He frowned but before he could open his\nmouth to ask, Rhodey explained. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nTony\u2019s. Was his favorite back in the day.

The dried\ntear tracks on his cheeks were slowly fading when he let the hot water pour\nover his face. He just had to keep his mind busy because the second he didn\u2019t,\nhe was back <i>there </i>and he was holding on to Tony\u2019s lifeless body and he\ncouldn\u2019t stand picturing the man like that. </p><p>Tony was\nvibrant. Always with a sarcastic quip on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes\nwhen they met Peter\u2019s. He was strong and smart and <i>alive</i>.

Underneath all the ugly bruises he was still so\nundeniably alive and that was all that mattered, all he let himself focus on to\nkeep his mind from spiraling.</p><p>Eventually he settled into the seat Rhodey had\nvacated and gingerly took hold of his mentor\u2019s hand, careful to avoid any and\nall wires he was attached to but especially the perfusion pump supplying him\nwith a steady stream of pain meds. He seemed to need it. </p><p>The older man\u2019s face was calm, the anesthesia\nworking its magic in relaxing his muscles and keeping the pain at bay. It\nseemed wrong, though, to see the expressive face of Tony Stark so devoid of any\nemotion and tension. Only a few wrinkles remained, especially the frowny ones\nbut Peter could make out the crow\u2019s feet and lines around his mouth, too, that\ntold a story of an easier time with laughter and movie nights instead of bloody\nhands and hospital beds.</p><p>The monitor was showing him the ECG recording\nand he let the steady beeping lull his unsettled thoughts until he was calm\nenough to really take in the injuries of the man that made up half of his small\nmake-shift family. </p><p>The oxygen mask on the billionaire\u2019s face was\nfogged with his breaths (<i>he was breathing</i>) but it seemed to be working\nbecause the pulse oximeter on his left hand recorded an oxygen saturation of\n100 percent. </p><p>Peter let out a small breath. </p><p>His blood pressure was steady, albeit a little\nlow with 110 to 60 but so much better than when \u2013</p><p>The stiff\nneck Tony was wearing looked uncomfortable but he didn\u2019t seem to mind so Peter\ntried to be okay with how weirdly rigid and unmovable it made the man look.</p><p>His eyes\nflickered over the case report on the nightstand. </p><p><b>Fracture\nof both anterior and posterior arch of C1 </b></p><p><b>Type III\nfracture of C2, stable, no indication for surgical treatment. </b></p><p><i>Stable</i>.

It was still pumping blood into his circulation, was still supplying\nhis cells with oxygen and was still keeping him alive. It was a steady\nheartbeat and it felt strong when it pulsated against Peter\u2019s fingers that were\npressed to his mentor\u2019s wrist. </p><p>Thud, thud,\nthud, thud.</p><p>He could\nhear it, too. If he concentrated hard enough he could make out not only the thud\nbut also the blood streaming through ventricle and atrium. He heard the valves\nopen and close and the soft swoosh when the blood fell back against closed\nvalves. </p><p>Still, he\ncouldn\u2019t forget the utter silence that had greeted him earlier. The memory of\nholding the lifeless man seemed to have been permanently etched into his brain.\nAn image so horribly familiar that it made him feel sick and scared as if he\nwas the small little boy again, begging for help. </p><p><i>Please\ndon\u2019t leave me. </i></p><p>Peter was\nmoving before he had consciously formed the thought and it made him stop in his\ntracks. Was he allowed to? The doctor had said to watch out for the wires and\nto be careful with his ribs and neck. But maybe if he was extra cautious it\nwould be okay? </p><p>Almost in\nslow motion he pushed the cables and tubes aside carefully and moved to sit on\nthe bed. Tony was laying a little more to the left side of the bed and so the\nteenager very deliberately draped himself on his mentor\u2019s right side until he\nwas curled around the man without jostling him too much. </p><p>He wound\nhis arm around his head gingerly and dropped his face to rest in the sweaty mob\nof hair. He breathed in the familiar scent that he could make out beneath all\nthe dust and dirt and blood and sweat. He breathed in Tony and, ever so slowly,\nhe started to relax. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><i>\u201cETA 3\nminutes.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Three\nmore minutes of Peter holding on to his mentor\u2019s head, too scared to move, too\nscared to do much of anything but let his body shake with silent sobs and keep\nlistening for that heartbeat that was still fluttering in his chest much too\nweakly for his taste. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s\ngonna be okay.\u201d For a lack of better option he started talking to the\nunresponsive man whose head was resting on his thighs and who didn\u2019t look like\nhe was ever going to wake up again.

He could rest for a bit, right? Tony surely\nwouldn\u2019t mind and he would tell the nurse where to shove it should she jostle\nPeter\u2026 yeah\u2026 he\u2019d just rest his eyes a little. Just for a few minutes. </p><p>His eyes\nslowly started to drop close, succumbing to the exhaustion that seemed to have\nsettled deep into his bones.</p><p>Of course\nTony took that moment to blink blearily, almost making Peter jolt in surprise. </p><p>\u201cLove ya,\ntoo, kiddo,\u201d he slurred, not really focusing on anything in particular, \u201cShould\nknow that.\u201d </p><p>And,\nwithout another word, the older man wrapped his right arm more firmly around\nhis prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and fell right back asleep with a soft snore. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Tony spent\nalmost a week in his bed in med bay until the doctors were certain he would be\nable to move his neck without danger of becoming paraplegic and Peter came to\nsee him every day, spending most of his time in the small, barren room. He\nwould bring his homework after school and once he was done with it they would\nwatch another movie or start on another TV show. Sometimes Rhodey or Pepper or\nMay would join them and bring them a home cooked dinner. Sometimes they just\nmunched on the pizzas F.R.I.D.A.Y. ordered. </p><p>Sometimes\nPeter would fall asleep curled around Tony and sometimes May would threaten him\nwith grounding if he didn\u2019t come back home to sleep in his own bed at some point\nbut <i>every time</i>, before he left, Peter would lean down to Tony and press\na kiss to his forehead gently. He would tell him he loved him and his mentor\nwould say it back. </p><p>He never\nwould have to be scared of not having said enough when he still had the time\never again. </p>",

He recognized the look, knew exactly what it felt like. Rhodey really did\nunderstand. He figured he must have spent most of his life worrying about Tony\nand the thought made the young vigilante feel nauseous. </p><p>&ldquo;But we\ncan&rsquo;t really do anything for him right now,&rdquo; Rhodey told him matter-of-factly,\nvoice calm and collected and gentle. &ldquo;And I know for a fact that they won&rsquo;t let\nyou into his room looking as filthy as you do.

Still, Peter appreciated it. </p><p>He just\nreally didn&rsquo;t want to go. </p><p>Rhodey\nsensed that and with a motion too quickly for his tired brain to keep up with,\nhe pulled something out from &ndash; from where exactly? Behind his back? The chair\nbeside him? Did it matter? </p><p>A pile of\nclothes landed in his arms and instinctively he grabbed to hold them.

He was with Tony after\nall. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Kids\nthese days,&rdquo; he heard his mentor mutter in mock annoyance, &ldquo;Too lazy to web\ntheir own way down to the fight.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Gotta keep you on your toes, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he\nquipped back before shooting out another web and leaving the billionaire&rsquo;s side\nto land on the side of a nearby building gracefully. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan, Mister\nStark?&rdquo; he asked, narrowing his eyes at the huge thing (honestly, he wasn&rsquo;t\nsure as what to classify the weird metallic body that was currently out for their\nblood). </i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s\nthe moment War Machine joined them, flying up in to hover next to Iron-Man,\nblasters out and ready to, well, blast. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna kick some ass is what\nwe&rsquo;re gonna do.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>The last\nthing he heard before Rhodey started firing was Tony&rsquo;s carefree laughter in his\near. </i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><hr /><p>He had just\nstepped out of the shower when F.R.I.D.A.Y. informed him that Tony was out of\nsurgery. It didn&rsquo;t take him more than three minutes until he was back in the\nmed bay, pants on the wrong way around and hoodie barely pulled over his head.</p><p>Looking\nlike the mess he felt, wet curls hanging in his face and almost tripping over\nhis feet, he barreled into the room and &ndash; stopped and stared. </p><p>The sight\nthat greeted him felt like a punch to the stomach and knocked the air out of his\nlungs, making him stumble. </p><p>Tony seemed\nto be swallowed up by the big bed, tubes sticking out of various parts of his\nbody. He took a tentative step closer but not too close, too scared to\naccidentally touch some of the wires and mess something important up. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s &ndash;&ldquo; he\nstammered, &ldquo;Is he &ndash;?&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s\nfine.&rdquo; Rhodey&rsquo;s voice was gentle but firm, demanding attention that Peter\ndidn&rsquo;t have to spare. His gaze seemed permanently stuck on the slight rise and\nfall of his mentor&rsquo;s chest. </p><p><i>Breathing\nmeant alive. They could work with alive. An alive Tony would fight his way back\nto them. </i></p><p>Rhodey\nstood up from the chair next to the bed, slowly approaching Peter until he was\nright beside him. Again, the hand settled on his shoulder, pulling him back from\nthe spiraling thoughts in his mind, grounding him in the moment. </p><p>Peter\nlooked up, Rhodey&rsquo;s face blurry through the veil of tears that he couldn&rsquo;t\nforce back. &ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve &ndash; I should&rsquo;ve done <i>something</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know\nas well as I do that there was nothing you could&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; </p><p>Deep down\nhe knew that he should have found a way. </p><p>&ldquo;He knew\nwhat he was doing and he knew the consequences but, most importantly, he knew\nwhat would happen if he didn&rsquo;t act.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><i>&ldquo;Well,\nthis is very not good.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t say, platypus.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eye roll was audible over the comms and if Peter\nhadn&rsquo;t been so focused on the thing they were fighting getting ready to fire a\nblast of </i>something\nvery<i> </i>not good<i> into a nearby skyscraper he might have even cracked a\nsmile. As it was, he was otherwise preoccupied. </i></p><p><i>He was\nso far out of his wheel house right now, he realized, when he swung to another\nbuilding closer to the two other heroes. &ldquo;What are we gonna do, Mister Stark?&rdquo;\nBecause surely his mentor knew what to do. He always knew what to do. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;About\nthat &ndash;&ldquo; </i></p><p><i>It all\nhappened so fast that Peter barely had time to process Rhodey&rsquo;s scream in his\near before Tony had flown in the way of the monster, putting himself between\nthe monster and its target and &ndash;</i></p><p><i>When the\ngreen blast hit the arc reactor Peter&rsquo;s heart plummeted. </i></p><p><i>Hope\nflared in his chest when Iron- Man somehow reversed the fire power, hitting the\nalien being that burst into a million pieces. But then he didn&rsquo;t reply and\nsimply fell. </i></p><p><i>He fell\nand fell and fell and then he stopped.</i></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>Once Rhodey\nhad left it took him a while until he dared to move closer to the bed.</p><p>Tony looked so fragile, <i>broken</i>, and as\nmuch as he couldn&rsquo;t bear to see him like that, Peter found that he was\nincapable of averting his eyes. Underneath all the ugly bruises he was still so\nundeniably alive and that was all that mattered, all he let himself focus on to\nkeep his mind from spiraling.</p><p>Eventually he settled into the seat Rhodey had\nvacated and gingerly took hold of his mentor&rsquo;s hand, careful to avoid any and\nall wires he was attached to but especially the perfusion pump supplying him\nwith a steady stream of pain meds. He seemed to need it. </p><p>The older man&rsquo;s face was calm, the anesthesia\nworking its magic in relaxing his muscles and keeping the pain at bay. It\nseemed wrong, though, to see the expressive face of Tony Stark so devoid of any\nemotion and tension. Only a few wrinkles remained, especially the frowny ones\nbut Peter could make out the crow&rsquo;s feet and lines around his mouth, too, that\ntold a story of an easier time with laughter and movie nights instead of bloody\nhands and hospital beds.</p><p>The monitor was showing him the ECG recording\nand he let the steady beeping lull his unsettled thoughts until he was calm\nenough to really take in the injuries of the man that made up half of his small\nmake-shift family. </p><p>The oxygen mask on the billionaire&rsquo;s face was\nfogged with his breaths (<i>he was breathing</i>) but it seemed to be working\nbecause the pulse oximeter on his left hand recorded an oxygen saturation of\n100 percent. </p><p>Peter let out a small breath. </p><p>His blood pressure was steady, albeit a little\nlow with 110 to 60 but so much better than when &ndash;</p><p>The stiff\nneck Tony was wearing looked uncomfortable but he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind so Peter\ntried to be okay with how weirdly rigid and unmovable it made the man look.</p><p>His eyes\nflickered over the case report on the nightstand. </p><p><b>Fracture\nof both anterior and posterior arch of C1 </b></p><p><b>Type III\nfracture of C2, stable, no indication for surgical treatment. </b></p><p><i>Stable</i>. He held onto that when he skimmed over\nthe rest of the text. </p><p><b>Type II\nspleen rupture</b></p><p><b>Fractured\n4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> left and 2nd right rib; 3rd rib broken\nbilaterally after CPR by first responder &ndash;</b></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><i>Peter\nreached him as soon as he could but it was still too late. Tony wasn&rsquo;t moving,\nwasn&rsquo;t responding, wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Karen,&rdquo;\nhe choked out, crawling to the lifeless armor on hands and knees, &ldquo;Can you get\nF.R.I.D.A.Y. to open the suit?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Not a\nsecond later the pieces of the suit retracted, revealing his mentor&rsquo;s beaten\nform. &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y. detected fractures of the upper cervical spine. It is\nrecommend to move the patient&rsquo;s neck as little as possible to not risk severing\nthe spinal cord.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then\nwhy didn&rsquo;t she just keep the armor on?&rdquo; he spit out, thoughts racing and suited\nhand pressed against his masked mouth. He couldn&rsquo;t look at this, he couldn&rsquo;t\nbreathe through this. He couldn&rsquo;t &ndash;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Mister\nStark is in immediate need of CPR.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>No. </i></p><p><i>He\ncouldn&rsquo;t do that. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Mister\nRhodes!&rdquo; he managed to call out to the superhero still flying through the air\nto keep the collateral damage as low as possible, &ldquo;You need to &ndash;&ldquo;</i></p><p><i>The\ncommanding voice that replied was tense and not at all reminiscent of the\nplayful teasing just minutes earlier. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Pete. You gotta do it. You know\nhow to do CPR, right?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Of\ncourse he knew CPR. He knew the steps, knew the moves but &ndash; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m &ndash;\nI&rsquo;m too strong,&rdquo; he whispered even as he pulled up his mask halfway and started\nkneeling at his mentor&rsquo;s head to get a better angle, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t control my\nstrength &ndash; I&rsquo;m gonna &ndash; I could kill him!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Still,\nhe started pressing down.</i></p><p><i>When he\nheard the first rib crack, Peter cried out in pain but didn&rsquo;t stop. He bent\ndown, tilting the man&rsquo;s head as carefully as he could and breathed for him twice\nbefore continuing to press down on his ribcage. </i></p><p><i>Another\ncrack. A broken rib. And Peter couldn&rsquo;t see through the tears that were running\ndown his cheeks and he couldn&rsquo;t breathe but he struggled through the panic\nsealing his lungs because Tony needed him to breathe for him. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Heartbeat\ndetected.&rdquo; </i></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>Beep, beep,\nbeep, beep. </p><p>His heart\nwas still beating. It was still pumping blood into his circulation, was still supplying\nhis cells with oxygen and was still keeping him alive. It was a steady\nheartbeat and it felt strong when it pulsated against Peter&rsquo;s fingers that were\npressed to his mentor&rsquo;s wrist. </p><p>Thud, thud,\nthud, thud.</p><p>He could\nhear it, too. If he concentrated hard enough he could make out not only the thud\nbut also the blood streaming through ventricle and atrium. He heard the valves\nopen and close and the soft swoosh when the blood fell back against closed\nvalves. </p><p>Still, he\ncouldn&rsquo;t forget the utter silence that had greeted him earlier. The memory of\nholding the lifeless man seemed to have been permanently etched into his brain.\nAn image so horribly familiar that it made him feel sick and scared as if he\nwas the small little boy again, begging for help. </p><p><i>Please\ndon&rsquo;t leave me. </i></p><p>Peter was\nmoving before he had consciously formed the thought and it made him stop in his\ntracks. Was he allowed to? The doctor had said to watch out for the wires and\nto be careful with his ribs and neck. But maybe if he was extra cautious it\nwould be okay? </p><p>Almost in\nslow motion he pushed the cables and tubes aside carefully and moved to sit on\nthe bed. Tony was laying a little more to the left side of the bed and so the\nteenager very deliberately draped himself on his mentor&rsquo;s right side until he\nwas curled around the man without jostling him too much. </p><p>He wound\nhis arm around his head gingerly and dropped his face to rest in the sweaty mob\nof hair. He breathed in the familiar scent that he could make out beneath all\nthe dust and dirt and blood and sweat. He breathed in Tony and, ever so slowly,\nhe started to relax. </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><i>&ldquo;ETA 3\nminutes.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Three\nmore minutes of Peter holding on to his mentor&rsquo;s head, too scared to move, too\nscared to do much of anything but let his body shake with silent sobs and keep\nlistening for that heartbeat that was still fluttering in his chest much too\nweakly for his taste. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\ngonna be okay.&rdquo; For a lack of better option he started talking to the\nunresponsive man whose head was resting on his thighs and who didn&rsquo;t look like\nhe was ever going to wake up again. But his heart was beating so he was going\nto wake up. He </i>had<i>\nto wake up. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y.\ncould probably fly you home in the suit but we don&rsquo;t wanna risk &ndash;&ldquo; severing\nyour spinal cord &ldquo; &ndash; it, so we&rsquo;re waiting for the ambulance. It should be here\nany minute now. You&rsquo;re gonna be fine, right? I mean, you always said you&rsquo;d\nprobably die of something stupid like tripping over Dum-E not on the\nbattlefield. You promised not to die before my wedding.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>It was\nstupid and childish yet he couldn&rsquo;t help but beg. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You\ncan&rsquo;t die. You were gonna teach me how to build an arch reactor and you\npromised to watch the new Star Wars movie with me the second it comes out. We already\nplanned our costumes, remember?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Suddenly\nthe Kylo Ren and Han Solo dress up they had planned seemed so inconsequential\nand trivial. He could&rsquo;ve spend the time arguing about Kylo&rsquo;s true feelings\ntelling his mentor how much he appreciated him. He should&rsquo;ve told him he loved\nhim instead of disagreeing over his breakfast choices. He should&rsquo;ve held on to\nhim more when he had the chance. He should&rsquo;ve &ndash; </i></p><p><i>He\nwould, he vowed silently, he would tell him. </i></p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I love\nyou,&rdquo; he whispered, the words he had never directed at him before oddly\nfamiliar on his tongue. &ldquo;Just, please wake up so I can tell you in person.&rdquo;\nBefore he thought better of it he leaned forward, pressed a gentle kiss to\nTony&rsquo;s forehead and rested his own against it. </p><p>Now that he\nwas surrounded by the warmth of his &ndash; his <i>person</i> and could feel his\nchest moving with every breath and could hear his heart beating steadily he\nrealized just how tired he was. He could rest for a bit, right? Tony surely\nwouldn&rsquo;t mind and he would tell the nurse where to shove it should she jostle\nPeter&hellip; yeah&hellip; he&rsquo;d just rest his eyes a little. Just for a few minutes. </p><p>His eyes\nslowly started to drop close, succumbing to the exhaustion that seemed to have\nsettled deep into his bones.</p><p>Of course\nTony took that moment to blink blearily, almost making Peter jolt in surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;Love ya,\ntoo, kiddo,&rdquo; he slurred, not really focusing on anything in particular, &ldquo;Should\nknow that.&rdquo; </p><p>And,\nwithout another word, the older man wrapped his right arm more firmly around\nhis prot&eacute;g&eacute; and fell right back asleep with a soft snore. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Tony spent\nalmost a week in his bed in med bay until the doctors were certain he would be\nable to move his neck without danger of becoming paraplegic and Peter came to\nsee him every day, spending most of his time in the small, barren room. He\nwould bring his homework after school and once he was done with it they would\nwatch another movie or start on another TV show. Sometimes Rhodey or Pepper or\nMay would join them and bring them a home cooked dinner. Sometimes they just\nmunched on the pizzas F.R.I.D.A.Y. ordered. </p><p>Sometimes\nPeter would fall asleep curled around Tony and sometimes May would threaten him\nwith grounding if he didn&rsquo;t come back home to sleep in his own bed at some point\nbut <i>every time</i>, before he left, Peter would lean down to Tony and press\na kiss to his forehead gently. He would tell him he loved him and his mentor\nwould say it back. </p><p>He never\nwould have to be scared of not having said enough when he still had the time\never again. </p>",
