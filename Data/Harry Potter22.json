        "body": "<p>Years have passed and times have changed. We were young, we were careless, we were bold. 4 friends joined together and became inseparable. A stubborn stag, a loyal dog, an innocent werewolf and a slippery rat. Together they wrecked chaos at Hogwarts. Pranks were done, enemies were challenged, love was proclaimed, secrets were sought out and solutions were found. Our friendship went from strength to strength.</p><p>We had our laughs, our pranks and our times. Every happy memory we had together. Sons were disowned, graduation took place, careers began, wars had started but we never left each other sides. Among the darkness, there was happiness and hope. the next line of us began. We had our happiness but only for a\u00a0 moment.</p><p>Prophecies came about, secrets were shared. Friends were betrayed, lives were sacrificed. A friend was lost, a kid was orphaned, grief took place. We were heartbroken, we were broken, we were enraged. Mistakes were repeated, hearts were shattered, a friend was abandoned, rage replaced grief, anger took over us, accusations were made, innocents were blamed, souls were sucked and imprisoned and we were separated. we realized that happiness never lasts forever.</p><p>one was dead, the other a traitor. Only 2 were left. A werewolf grieving, an innocent convict. There was sadness, there was misery, there was darkness. Days felt like months, months felt like years. A soul was left empty, a friend was left broken. Both struggling with the truth. Both wishing for time to stop. 12 years of being heartbroken and still not yet healed. Who knew pain could hurt so much?</p><p>Then things changed. Depression became desperation. Desperation became determination. A new spark. The traitor was back. A new motive. The determination was fuelled by rage, A convict escaped in the search for justice, a friend became a professor. Truths were revealed, friends were reunited, a traitor was captured. A werewolf took form in the light of a full moon, traitors escaped, time was reversed, lives were saved, godson met godfather, promises to meet again were made. We were stubborn and nothing was over yet.</p><p>A professor resigned, the ministry was tricked, a convict in hiding and stuck in grim old places. The past came back to us haunt us, old family feuds and punishments renewed, stuck in hateful places. Dealing with loss, dealing with pain, painful accusations filling our head. No matter how much you want it to end, the past never leaves you; we learnt that the hard way.</p><p>Getting tired of old ways, sitting in the darkness, reminded of past mistakes and regret. Wanting to feel the sunshine, needing to be free. Caged and hopeless. We were lost, we were broken, we were tired. We didn\u2019t know life would get so bad. Then godson got in trouble, ready for an adventure, rules were broken, godson was saved. Cousins met and became rivals and battles took place. Back into the game, the adrenaline pumping through our veins, we felt alive once again, reminded of old times. then that feeling came crashing, struck square in the chest, falling through a veil, greiving godsons and racing friends. Godsons left behind, promises to be a family were broken, lost never to be fulfilled. One\u2019s journy came to an end, engulfed in darkness.</p><p>Another dead. One was left. The last of us. Struggling. Pain. Defeat. Sitting alone with no one left, remembering. Remembering friends, adventures, pranks. Outside he was alright, inside he was broken. A grieving werewolf left alone in this world. Love was proclaimed, love was rejected. The war had begun once again. Missions took place. Attacks were fought. Love was confronted, love was embraced. still coping with the past and present, with no idea for the future.</p><p>The war continued to rage. A leader fell. The world was in darkness. Up to kids to save what was left. History repeats itself. A war, children fighting, loved ones lost. Once again amongst the darkness, a bundle of joy. The next generation of us continued to grow.
