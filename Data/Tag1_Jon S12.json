Daenerys thinks he has defected, though Tyrion does not believe it. <i>(This puts Tyrion on Dany&rsquo;s s**tlist even more.)</i><br /></p><p>Jaime arrives on the day of The Last War, sneaking his way into the Red Keep along with the refugee civilians Cersei is housing as a meat shield. Once inside, he reveals himself to the Kingsguard and is brought directly to Cersei, professing his love for her once more. Cersei has never felt more alone&ndash;and is carrying Jaime&rsquo;s child&ndash;and loses herself for just a moment. And Jaime, wielding Brienne&rsquo;s Oathkeeper, once more upholds his destiny as a Kingslayer and kills Cersei to stop the war. He leaves the blade behind, abandoning his identity as a warrior, and throws the golden hand (a symbol of his family and a gift from Cersei) out the window of the Red Keep.<br />He goes to leave and end the war&ndash;to save the people of King&rsquo;s Landing from Daenerys&ndash;but it is too late. Daenerys decides to rip Cersei out root and stem and slaughters everyone in the Red Keep in dragonfire&ndash;Jaime included. Jaime dies a hero&rsquo;s death, and Daenerys has committed a terrible<i> (but PERFECTLY. JUSTIFIABLE.) </i>atrocity.</p><p>The final episode sees characters debating over Daenerys&rsquo;s ruthlessness&ndash;Jon and Tyrion are not quite convinced that Daenerys is an irredeemable evil queen <i>(because she really isn&rsquo;t)</i>, but also cannot justify her actions any longer and fear a repeat situation should the remaining lords of Westeros rebel. <br /><br />Tyrion investigates the Red Keep to confirm his sister&rsquo;s death for the new Queen of the Seven Kingdoms&ndash;he must prove his allegiance to Daenerys and must stay in her good graces now more than ever. On the way up, he spots a suspiciously familiar golden hand, a foreboding sign that something is amiss. <br />He searches the ruins of the Keep with a handful of Unsullied,. They uncover Cersei, a half-charred, unrecognizably marred corpse in the Map Courtyard ruins which has been stabbed with Jaime&rsquo;s recognizable Valyrian Steel blade. <i>(Valyrian Steel is forged with dragonfire, and here we find out it can also mostly withstand it. This resolves why the importance of Valyrian Steel was never addressed in the show.) </i><br /></p><p>Tyrion deduces that not only has Jaime died a needless death at the hands of Daenerys&ndash;but so did the people of King&rsquo;s Landing. The Unsullied are with him, so what transpired is undeniable. Had Daenerys fought the proper war and not resorted to massacring everyone with dragonfire, she would have known that Cersei died before the battle and all the citizens would have survived entirely unharmed. All the innocents Daenerys killed had died for nothing.</p><p>He tells Daenerys the news, in anger and grief, and to her dismay <i>(and as a result of her increasingly poor PR and Jon&rsquo;s more legitimate claim)</i>, Daenerys orders Tyrion be tried for treason. She is furious that Tyrion appears to distrust her and that his loyalty has faltered, but in truth she is trying to cover up what she&rsquo;d unknowingly done. This new development would unconditionally prevent her from becoming a true queen, as the lords and ladies would never accept her now. She is doubting in herself at this point&ndash;she is not a murderer, but she has nothing left but the Iron Throne she had only just won for herself. We see her weigh her options with what she must do to her last ally, Greyworm.</p><p>Jon Snow sneaks into Tyrion&rsquo;s jail cell and learns the truth&ndash;a truth that by this point sounds too familiar and too honest to be false&ndash;and decides to do what he must to protect the realm and his family. <br /></p><p>Daenerys has her coronation&ndash;a somber affair due to its nature, albeit satisfying in that it actually happens. She is finally queen, though there is no throne to sit upon now. It mirrors Cersei&rsquo;s coronation after the destruction of the Sept of Baelor. <br />Afterward, she decides to wander her way through the ruins of the Red Keep&ndash; she finds the Iron Throne still mostly intact and finally sits upon it, completely alone amidst the ruins of the keep. A queen of the ashes, a dragon in truth with no friends or equals.<br /></p><p>Jon seizes his opportunity and follows her to the ruined throne room to complete his mission, and is met with the monologue of a conflicted Daenerys as she contemplates all she&rsquo;s had to do to get to this point and what she now must do to stay there&ndash;it serves as both a humanizing moment for her, as well as a solidification that Daenerys has always justified committing unspeakable horrors on her enemies. She speaks of crucifixion and burning trusted advisors alive, and Jon resolves himself. Jon falters as he sees Daenerys begin to regret her actions and lament the looming execution of another of her advisors&ndash; but as Daenerys maintains her faith in herself and her destiny, Jon finally understands that there is no such thing as good and evil. Daenerys displays for him how both exist side-by-side. Jon decides to champion the realm and kills Daenerys to prevent any further death or destruction.<br />As a result of his queenslaying, Jon is put to trial by the Unsullied and Dothraki forces. On the ruined steps of the Red Keep, Jon Snow is beheaded for treason. <i>(Thus, we are spared his Night&rsquo;s Watch ending, and his character arc solidifies his role as Ned Stark&rsquo;s true son and completes his various parallels to Jaime Lannister, who also just killed a queen who was once his lover. He defies his Targaryen family and dies an honorable death for the good of the realm.)</i><br />From there, I could really no give a f*&amp;Rk what happens next. I mostly cared about the botched Jaime, Daenerys, Jon, and Tyrion story arcs.<br /><br /><br /></p>",

        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>if you look at the North&rsquo;s succession in the books it is an absolute mess, because many people work under false assumptions and somehow every Stark but Bran has a faction that supports him or her. There is Robb&rsquo;s will (that did not disinherit Sansa as far as we know, but pushed Jon ahead in the line of inheritance) whose whereabouts are currently unknown but that works under the assumption that a) Bran and Rickon are dead and b) that Jon is actually Ned&rsquo;s bastard son. Then there is Sansa whose claim is pushed by Littlefinger who also works under the assumption that Bran and Rickon are dead and that he can count out Jon who is a bastard and in the NW. Then there is Davos who searches for Rickon to make him Lord of Winterfell because Stannis needs one and Jon did deny Stannis. Then there are the Northerners who actually think that fArya is Arya and want to go to war for Ned&rsquo;s little girl. They also assume Bran and Rickon are dead and that Sansa is lost. Nobody has heard from her after all. In light of a possible endgame with Bran as king I think it is quite interesting that there is no faction that backs Bran because apart from Sam nobody knows he is alive.</p><p>It is a recipe for disaster and a succession war that could estrange the Starks forever&hellip;.. And yet I think that the outcome will not be that different from the show. Jon and Sansa will reunite, Rickon will die (sob), fArya will be identified as Jeyne, Bran and Arya will stay out of the picture and Jon and Sansa will come to an understanding. To have Jon as King and military head of House Stark and Sansa as Lady of Winterfell, so that Jon does not oust her from her right to Winterfell is actually quite a sensible and good solution as long as they agree on what to do with eventual children. Jon might agree to let Sansa&rsquo;s children inherit for example. I think such an agreement is quite plausible especially if they defeat the Bolton together. If it includes an agreement of an unmarried Jon and Sansa as his heir, the eventual knee-bend to Dany will lead to tension as well.</p><p>I do think it would be natural for Sansa to feel some resentment over Robb&rsquo;s will, but it is one thing to feel that and another to lash out because of that resentment. I do think that Sansa will know that Jon did not ask for this and if they campaign together and believe that they are the only Starks left Sansa will always choose cooperation over machination. </p><p>Also, although Catelyn voiced her fear of Jon in front of Robb when he prepared the will I don&rsquo;t think she ever did so in Winterfell. There was no need : Ned was alive and loved her, Cat had three sons and two daughters who would all come before Jon&hellip; When Robb wrote his will, he was about to begin a dangerous campaign, had no children of his own, Bran and Rickon were dead as far as Cat knew, Arya lost and Sansa married to a Lannister. It was only then that the prospect of Jon inheriting was suddenly much closer and Cat said something. I doubt she ever said anything in that regard while Ned was alive and they were in Winterfell where Sansa could have heard it.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

There is Robb\u2019s will (that did not disinherit Sansa as far as we know, but pushed Jon ahead in the line of inheritance) whose whereabouts are currently unknown but that works under the assumption that a) Bran and Rickon are dead and b) that Jon is actually Ned\u2019s bastard son. Then there is Sansa whose claim is pushed by Littlefinger who also works under the assumption that Bran and Rickon are dead and that he can count out Jon who is a bastard and in the NW. Then there is Davos who searches for Rickon to make him Lord of Winterfell because Stannis needs one and Jon did deny Stannis. Then there are the Northerners who actually think that fArya is Arya and want to go to war for Ned\u2019s little girl. They also assume Bran and Rickon are dead and that Sansa is lost. Nobody has heard from her after all. In light of a possible endgame with Bran as king I think it is quite interesting that there is no faction that backs Bran because apart from Sam nobody knows he is alive.</p><p>It is a recipe for disaster and a succession war that could estrange the Starks forever\u2026.. And yet I think that the outcome will not be that different from the show. Jon and Sansa will reunite, Rickon will die (sob), fArya will be identified as Jeyne, Bran and Arya will stay out of the picture and Jon and Sansa will come to an understanding. To have Jon as King and military head of House Stark and Sansa as Lady of Winterfell, so that Jon does not oust her from her right to Winterfell is actually quite a sensible and good solution as long as they agree on what to do with eventual children. Jon might agree to let Sansa\u2019s children inherit for example. I think such an agreement is quite plausible especially if they defeat the Bolton together. If it includes an agreement of an unmarried Jon and Sansa as his heir, the eventual knee-bend to Dany will lead to tension as well.</p><p>I do think it would be natural for Sansa to feel some resentment over Robb\u2019s will, but it is one thing to feel that and another to lash out because of that resentment.
