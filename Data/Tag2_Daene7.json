That was back in 2014/15 when GoT had just passed the source material. And at the time, George had no reason to suspect that they\u2019d absolutely fuck his life\u2019s work. I mean, George himself acknowledged that the show had made same changes that he wished he would have done. One of the main ones being Arya meeting Tywin at Harrenhal. Practically everyone agrees that it\u2019s one of the best changes. So, at the time, George had no reason to worry. And then S7 came out. And it was clear that George was distancing himself as much as humanly possibly from the shitshow he foresaw coming. iirc, D&amp;D didn\u2019t even give him a script to read for what was to come for S8 like they did previous seasons. </p><p>But Brandon! What about his interview with 60 minutes? Where George said he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be that different? </p><p>To that I say, \u201cwatch it again\u201d. Look at the reluctance on that man\u2019s face as he answers it. There is goddamn pain there, hidden far better than Emilia Clarke\u2019s displeasure at S8 but still readable. Why is there pain? Because he knows that the ending is SO much different. Because what happened in the show does not line up with his ending in the books. Dorne? Fucked in the show? FAegon? His story is split between Cersei and Jon(who does jack shit in S8). White Walkers? The NK was created for a convenient one hit self destruct button. </p><p>Moreover, George didn\u2019t talk about S8 once. He never tweeted after an episode. He didn\u2019t write about it on his blog, instead rather more interested in the NFL draft. The only time he talked about S8 was after the finale and even then it was simply to tell us he was working on Winds of Winter. He didn\u2019t talk about how brilliant he found the season. Just that the ride was over. Yup. </p><p>Finally, it\u2019s also very clear that D&amp;D went their own way. Lena Headey\u2019s confirmation about filming a miscarriage was the final nail in the coffin that confirmed to me that S8 was no way in hell a direction that Martin was intending. David and Dan\u2019s own words confirm this. Saying that they wanted Arya to kill the NK because it was unexpected! This was a decision they came to in 2016. Years after Martin was done advising them. It became very clear to me that David and Dan abused their exclusive TV rights to the show and told the story how THEY wanted it to end. </p><h1>Now, onto why I think Jon and Dany will live.</h1><p>I believe I should first make it known that I do think Dany will die. Yup, I said it. I think she will die, and I think she will be resurrected. Why? Because Dany has been claimed to have been \u201creborn\u201d after emerging from the flames unscathed. Reborn, which implicated that she died and was born again. But she didn\u2019t die. Not at all. Martin has confirmed that it was a once in a lifetime miracle of blood magic involved. However, I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s using her description of rebirth just for smokes and mirrors. He is, correctly, using foreshadowing. </p><p>Dany will die and then be reborn via a red priestess. And why not? She has the entire fucking temple set to back her in the books, like in the show. And you\u2019re telling me that somebody isn\u2019t going to suggest having them revive her? One of her followers, possibly Jon, won\u2019t go to a red priestess and beg for something to be done? And you know what? I think she WAS meant to be reborn. And that\u2019s what pisses me off. Because I believe D&amp;D decided not to and then just teased us with it for a final slap in the face. Sam mentions that Drogon was seen in Volantis and one of the songs for season 8, \u201cPray\u201d, mentions that \u2018We can bring her back, we can bring her back\u2019. </p><p>So, I think she will die and be resurrected, further bringing Jon and Daenerys closer to one another and paralleling their roads as similar once again. </p><p>And after her resurrection, she\u2019ll find Jon living in a house with a red door and a lemon tree. A house that she told  him about when she was previously alive. And for the final cherry on top? It\u2019s in Dorne. Why in Dorne? Because Martin has hinted to us that Braavos does not grow lemon trees and does not hold the climate that Daenerys remembers so fondly. And Dorne also holds significance to Jon. It is the place of his birth and more significant, somewhere warm. </p><p>During season 6, the last season that D&amp;D followed the story logically with some little semblance, Jon tells Edd that he will look for some place to get warm. Yet, he never does. Not once does he ever go to a warm climate area. The closest he ever comes to warmth are Dragonstone, which is already described as being cold during the winter without experiencing snow, and King\u2019s Landing. And the only time he ever experienced the two are during&hellip;*drum roll*&hellip;winter&hellip; the coldest season. Something else that I\u2019m sure D&amp;D changed from the ending. You mean to tell me that Jon Snow has no intention of visiting where it all started? Where he was born? Where his mother died? Fuck off. </p><p>And lastly, they will have a child. Something else that D&amp;D ignored, I believe. Why? Because we already have evidence of them changing shit for their desires. I believe Jon WAS meant to go further south and end up in Dorne(the warmest place in Westeros). They teased in S6 and ignored it when it didn\u2019t suit their story. Something else that didn\u2019t suit their story? A baby. </p><p>At the end of S6, book readers were left wondering what the hell happened to Daenerys\u2019 fertility, seeing as she suffers a miscarriage at the end of ADWD. Then we said, \u201coh, better to leave it here for impact for boatbaby I guess\u201d when they finally fucking talked about it in S7. Except, no! She is barren after all! No suggestions that she ever got pregnant in S8. Screw you D&amp;D. George gave it clear to us that she can get pregnant once more. </p><p>So there. I think the Walker threat will be resolved (and no, I don\u2019t believe that shitty theory that Jon has to come to an agreement with the WW and live as an ambassador for the living. That\u2019s as worse as the \u201cBran is dreaming it all\u201d Theory), Dany will die and be resurrected and Jon and Dany will live together in Dorne in a House with a Red Door that has a lemon tree.

However, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s using her description of rebirth just for smokes and mirrors. He is, correctly, using foreshadowing. </p><p>Dany will die and then be reborn via a red priestess. And why not? She has the entire fucking temple set to back her in the books, like in the show. And you&rsquo;re telling me that somebody isn&rsquo;t going to suggest having them revive her? One of her followers, possibly Jon, won&rsquo;t go to a red priestess and beg for something to be done? And you know what? I think she WAS meant to be reborn. And that&rsquo;s what pisses me off. Because I believe D&amp;D decided not to and then just teased us with it for a final slap in the face. Sam mentions that Drogon was seen in Volantis and one of the songs for season 8, &ldquo;Pray&rdquo;, mentions that &lsquo;We can bring her back, we can bring her back&rsquo;. </p><p>So, I think she will die and be resurrected, further bringing Jon and Daenerys closer to one another and paralleling their roads as similar once again. </p><p>And after her resurrection, she&rsquo;ll find Jon living in a house with a red door and a lemon tree. A house that she told  him about when she was previously alive. And for the final cherry on top? It&rsquo;s in Dorne. Why in Dorne? Because Martin has hinted to us that Braavos does not grow lemon trees and does not hold the climate that Daenerys remembers so fondly. And Dorne also holds significance to Jon. It is the place of his birth and more significant, somewhere warm. </p><p>During season 6, the last season that D&amp;D followed the story logically with some little semblance, Jon tells Edd that he will look for some place to get warm. Yet, he never does. Not once does he ever go to a warm climate area. The closest he ever comes to warmth are Dragonstone, which is already described as being cold during the winter without experiencing snow, and King&rsquo;s Landing. And the only time he ever experienced the two are during&hellip;*drum roll*&hellip;winter&hellip; the coldest season. Something else that I&rsquo;m sure D&amp;D changed from the ending. You mean to tell me that Jon Snow has no intention of visiting where it all started? Where he was born? Where his mother died? Fuck off. </p><p>And lastly, they will have a child. Something else that D&amp;D ignored, I believe. Why? Because we already have evidence of them changing shit for their desires. I believe Jon WAS meant to go further south and end up in Dorne(the warmest place in Westeros). They teased in S6 and ignored it when it didn&rsquo;t suit their story. Something else that didn&rsquo;t suit their story? A baby. </p><p>At the end of S6, book readers were left wondering what the hell happened to Daenerys&rsquo; fertility, seeing as she suffers a miscarriage at the end of ADWD. Then we said, &ldquo;oh, better to leave it here for impact for boatbaby I guess&rdquo; when they finally fucking talked about it in S7. Except, no! She is barren after all! No suggestions that she ever got pregnant in S8. Screw you D&amp;D. George gave it clear to us that she can get pregnant once more. </p><p>So there. I think the Walker threat will be resolved (and no, I don&rsquo;t believe that shitty theory that Jon has to come to an agreement with the WW and live as an ambassador for the living. That&rsquo;s as worse as the &ldquo;Bran is dreaming it all&rdquo; Theory), Dany will die and be resurrected and Jon and Dany will live together in Dorne in a House with a Red Door that has a lemon tree. And that they will live out their days with their children and grandchildren, away from all the politics and leadership they were forced into.</p></p>",
