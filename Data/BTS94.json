You felt your heart thud in your chest, despite yourself, and took a deep breath as you approached him, tugging down the hem of your plain white camisole and adjusting the strap of the fabric tote bag on your shoulder.<br/></p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d You called from behind him. He turned around at the sound of your voice, away from the crowd. He looked a little dazed for a moment, before he smiled softly. <br/></p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d Without warning, he leaned down and kissed you gently on the lips. He had pulled away before you had time to register what had happened, but you felt your heart thud once more and you had to force yourself to close your mouth. He laughed gently at your reaction as you looked away from him to the floor. It wasn\u2019t like you had never kissed him before. In fact, you had done a little more than kiss in the past. It was just that, until he had texted you yesterday evening asking if you wished to go for a walk in the woods by \nChangdeokgung Palace, you had not spoken for three weeks. If you were honest with yourself, the fault also lied in yourself. You had decided not to text or message him until he did so first and so the stalemate began. You didn\u2019t even know whether or not he was your boyfriend. You had been seeing each other for the past three months, yet he had never said as much, and you had never asked. <br/></p><p>\u201cI like your skirt.\u201d He nodded towards your long, floaty skirt. It was decorated in jewel toned embroidery; greens and purples and oranges. You smiled and thanked him.<br/></p><p>\u201cShall we walk this way?\u201d Taehyung indicated down a narrow, winding path which led towards a cluster of trees. You nodded and had to stop yourself from letting out a mutter of surprise as he reached down and took your hand in his. You walked towards the park in silence, passing several other couples and families before you met the thick line of trees. <br/></p><p>Eventually, he spoke. \u201cI liked your play.\u201d <br/></p><p>You frowned, confused. \u201cWhich one?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cHamlet. At the Jeongdong.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou made a great Ophelia.\u201d <br/></p><p>Your forehead wrinkled even further. \u201cYou saw my play? When?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cLast Thursday.\u201d <br/></p><p>You let out a small laugh, without much humour. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were going? We could have done something afterwards.\u201d</p><p>He looked at you. \u201cI thought you were probably busy.\u201d <br/></p><p>You shook your head as you turned a corner and passed a small, stone carving by the side of the path. \u201cI could have at least seen you&hellip;said hello.\u201d You sighed before deciding to let it drop. \u201cI\u2019m playing Honey in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf next&hellip;at the National. We start practising in two weeks.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You turn another bend in the path and find yourself passing a small fish pond. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the play. I enjoyed the film. Elizabeth Taylor was great.\u201d <br/></p><p>You glance at the small body of water and watch the shimmery gold and piebald yellow carp as they swim just below the surface.\u00a0\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be away again by the time it is on.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cAway?\u201d He turned to glance at you. <br/></p><p>\u201cOn tour. You\u2019re going to America.\u201d <br/></p><p>He paused. \u201cOh yeah. I forgot.\u201d He sounded a little sad. The pond ended and you passed a group of wooden benches, scattered between the trees. There was an elderly couple seated at one, holding hands as they watched the fish in the pond from a distance. Without really thinking, you squeezed Taehyung\u2019s hand tighter. He looked down at you as you smiled. <br/></p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d You made a small gesture to the pair on the bench but kept your voice a whisper. \u201cCute old couple.\u201d <br/></p><p>His expression was incredibly gentle beneath the canopy of green trees. \u201cThey look so content.\u201d He held your hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\n hope I&rsquo;m as happy as they look when I\u2019m their age.\u201d You said quietly, \npassing by them. They dissapeared from view as you turned another \ncorner. The path branched off into three lanes. You chose the left \nstrand. You became aware that the number of people you passed was \ngrowing less and less every minuite as you walked deeper into the \nparkland. <br/></p><p>Taehyung moved your hand to his lips and pressed a \nkiss to your knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be.\u201d You continued walking for\n another five minutes in silence, evetually letting go of his hand and \nwalking side by side, before you finally broke the quiet. <br/></p><p>\u201cI \nwasn\u2019t sure you wanted to see me again.\u201d You admitted as you turned down\n another path. \u201cI thought maybe you didn\u2019t like me that much.\u201d You \nshrugged. <br/></p><p>There was a pause before he spoke. \u201cOf course I like you.\u201d He sounded confused.<br/></p><p>You\n glanced at him. He looked beautiful in the shade. \u201cI just \nthought&hellip;since we haven\u2019t spoken for a while.\u201d You gathered your thoughts. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what I \nmeant to you. Whether we were dating, or&hellip;?\u201d <br/></p><p>He looked puzzled, his gaze dropping to his shoes as you both subconsciously slowed your speed. \u201cI\u2019d have said we were dating.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been intimate.\u201d <br/></p><p>You felt your cheeks redden. \u201cYes.\u201d You agreed, remembering how you had taken him in your mouth and how his fingers had pressed against your opening, sinking into you until you gasped into his open mouth. You didn\u2019t question his reasoning. You thought plenty of people would be happy to be intimate with someone without dating them. You took a quick glance at Taehyung and noted how, unlike yourself, he didn\u2019t seem embarassed. His warm, caramel coloured skin seemed to glow in the sunlight as the trees parted into a clearing. There was another small pond surrounded by a low brick wall. There was no one else in sight. You hadn\u2019t seen another person now for over half an hour.<br/></p><p>He reached over to you and took your hand in his once more, leading you around the edge of the pond and back into the canopy of trees at the far side of the clearing. Another minute passed before you spoke. \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d <br/></p><p>He shook his head softly. \u201cNo.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You briefly looked around you. \u201cDo you think you can get us back?\u201d <br/></p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sure I can.\u201d He turned to look at you. \u201cAre you worried?\u201d <br/></p><p>Your eyes met his. \u201cNo.\u201d He looked incredibly beautiful. You sighed, leaning in to meet his lips. His mouth touched yours gently as you turned your head and pressed yourself closer. In unison, you parted your lips to allow your tongues to meet. His right hand came around the back of your head and brushed through your hair, holding you against him. His other hand left your own and moved to brush your cheekbone as his tongue brushed against yours. You quickly felt your breath increasing as he kissed you like this; it felt incredibly sexy and, had you not been completely confident that you were alone, you would have felt exposed and indecent. As it happened, having him confirm his feelings for you after months of uncertainty had been enough to make you ache for him. You had forgotten, in the three weeks apart, how good he had made you feel the last time you were alone together. You thought that every time his eyes moved across your features, he made you feel like Helen of Troy. You had never felt more desirable with someone before.<br/></p><p>You moaned into his mouth as his palm left your face and brushed the white strap of your camisole down your shoulder, causing the strap of your tote bag to drop to the crook of your elbow. He paused to caress your upper arm gently before repeating the motion with your other strap. You both moved off the loosely marked path without thinking, him leading you backwards until your back pressed against the trunk of a tree. You moved your hands to tug the thin, white material of his shirt from the waistband of his linen trousers. They were tucked in loosely and the shirt came free easily. You ran your hands along his bare stomach, over his bellybutton and delighted in the small sounds he made as your hands came in contact with his skin. Slowly, you moved your palm lower, not really thinking about what you were doing until your hand skimmed along his clothed erection. Like the shirt, the linen pants were very thin and, you fancied, you could feel every vein and groove through his underwear. He groaned loudly into your open mouth before pulling his lips away from yours to look at you. He gazed down through thick eyelashes and you felt your own breath hitch in reply. His desire for you was obvious but he moved his eyes from yours to briefly look around the open space, cautiously. You were no longer in view of the small path but the trees here were still widely spread out. <br/></p><p>Slowly, he reached down for your hand and led you over a small incline in the forest floor. The hill soon levelled out before dropping again. You followed him back down until the ground was level again. You thought that even if somebody did walk past on the main path, they would not be able to see or hear you from their vantage. His hands and mouth were back on you as you allowed yourself to be lowered onto the floor, dropping your canvas bag to the side. The ground was mossy and a little spongy, supporting and cushioning your body surprisingly well. You moved your hands beneath you to push aside a few twigs as he joined you. <br/></p><p>You thought he might protest as you hitched up the hem of your long, loosely fitting skirt and tugged down your plain, pink panties. After all, this was not the most comfortable place to be fucking, even if it wasn\u2019t your first time together. He simply kissed you passionately in return, however, as you ran your hands along his waistband once more. The air was warm and everything felt still and silent; you would have been able to hear a pin drop in that moment. Despite everything, you thought it felt right that you should do it here and now. You didn\u2019t think you would be able to wait to find your way back to the tourist site anyhow, and you certainly didn\u2019t think you would be able to recapture this moment of utter stillness and silence later in his third story apartment in the middle of Gangnam. <br/></p><p>He ran his hand along your right leg, starting at your calf and ending at your upper thigh as he leaned over you. You reached over to the colourful fabric of your bag and unlatched the magnetic button. You felt inside with one hand, the other slowly pulling the white cord of Taehyung\u2019s trousers until the small bow came undone. You found your wallet amongst a few cosmetics and an empty plastic bottle of Coca Cola and pulled it out, quickly snapping open the button which held it closed and reaching inside of the flaps for a condom. Taehyung raised his eyebrow, briefly, a small smile playing on his lips as you pulled out the small square foil and tore the edge. Reaching forward as he balanced himself above you, you pulled down his white linen trousers and plain, cotton underwear to free his erection. As remembered, he was both longer and thicker than you had initially anticipated and you found yourself admiring him through your eyelashes, your mouth lulling open as you pinched the tip of the latex and rolled it onto him slowly. He moaned as your hand grasped him, guiding him to the space between your thighs. <br/></p><p>He sank into you slowly. It felt a little uncomfortable due to his size and the lack of preparation, but he anticipated this as he paused. <br/></p><p>\u201cIs it too much?\u201d He whispered. <br/></p><p>You shook your head and pecked his lips, once. He moved one hand to your face and stroked your cheek a little roughly with his thumb before burying himself fully. You gasped together, pressing your faces close. <br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d You reassured him as he gazed down at you. \u201cYou feel good&hellip;\u201d He hesitated for a moment before moving his hips against you, pulling almost all of the way out before pushing back inside. You felt him stretch you; could feel the tip of his cock pressing and brushing against your sensitive walls as he fucked you slowly, all the while watching your expression with slightly parted lips. You moved your head upwards to meet his lips. His hands trailed to your hips as he pushed his pelvis against the backs of your thighs; thrusting into you as far as he could go. You moaned breathily as he increased his speed. You suddenly heard the flapping of wings somewhere above your head, in the canopy of trees as a bird took flight. You thought Taehyung might have suddenly become aware of his surroundings as he pushed against you, now practically slamming into you in an attempt to reach his high. You held onto his shoulders tightly as he moved his mouth towards your chest and began to kiss along your breasts, above the fringe of your camisole; in wet, open mouthed kisses. <br/></p><p>You felt him shudder against you as his hips snapped against you frantically. His lips met yours once again and he moaned loudly into your open mouth as you held him. His eyelashes fluttered against his cheeks like the delicate wings of a moth as he came. You felt him twitch inside you and he held you still for a moment, savouring the sensation, before slowly pulling out of you. He reached down, between your slightly damp thighs, to grasp the condom as he withdrew. You exhaled in a long, deep breath as he moved away from you, turning away from you to remove the condom. You took a moment to gather yourself, suddenly feeling a little ridiculous as you looked at your surroundings and a little ashamed at your lack of self control. You sighed and reached for your discarded underwear, slipping them back on and rolling your skirt back down over your bare knees. <br/></p><p>Taehyung had knotted the condom and held it in one hand. He reached for your hand with the other and, with a sweet smile, pulled you to your feet. You brushed your cami and skirt down, smoothing out the fabric as you looked at him, your cheeks and chest flushed. He flashed his teeth in a grin as he reached with his spare hand and pulled a few twigs and leaves from your brunette hair. <br/></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d You said, reaching down to pick up your wallet and tote bag. \u201cHere&hellip;\u201d You reached into your bag and produced the empty bottle of Cola. \u201cI don\u2019t want you littering.\u201d You kept a straight face, still feeling a little bashful as Taehyung took it from you and discarded the used condom in the bottle. You hid it back in your bag, promising yourself that you would get rid of it as soon as you passed a litter bin. He took your hand gently in his as he lead you back up the gentle slope and towards the deserted forest path. <br/></p><p>\u201cDoes this mean I can call you my boyfriend?\u201d You asked after a few minutes. You had once more passed the small fish pond and thought you would be able to make it back to the tourist path before it got too late and started to get dark. <br/></p><p>He turned to look at you and grinned. His eyes crinkled at the corners as he flashed his teeth. You felt your chest ache once more at how sweet he looked, in the warm light of the afternoon. \u201cI hope so.\u201d He squeezed your hand tightly. \u201cI hope I get to see your play&hellip;\u201d <br/></p><p>You paused. \u201cHmm?\u201d Questioning.</p><p>\u201cVirginia Woolf. I hope I get to see it before I go to America.\u201d <br/></p><p>You smiled and nodded. \u201cI hope so too.\u201d You stood on your tiptoes and kissed his cheek, inhaling his gentle, vetiver scent as you walked along the quiet path, hand in hand. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>***</p><p><br/></p><p>Thank you so much for reading.

You felt your heart thud in your chest, despite yourself, and took a deep breath as you approached him, tugging down the hem of your plain white camisole and adjusting the strap of the fabric tote bag on your shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d You called from behind him. He turned around at the sound of your voice, away from the crowd. He looked a little dazed for a moment, before he smiled softly. <br></p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d Without warning, he leaned down and kissed you gently on the lips. He had pulled away before you had time to register what had happened, but you felt your heart thud once more and you had to force yourself to close your mouth. He laughed gently at your reaction as you looked away from him to the floor. It wasn\u2019t like you had never kissed him before. In fact, you had done a little more than kiss in the past. It was just that, until he had texted you yesterday evening asking if you wished to go for a walk in the woods by \nChangdeokgung Palace, you had not spoken for three weeks. If you were honest with yourself, the fault also lied in yourself. You had decided not to text or message him until he did so first and so the stalemate began. You didn\u2019t even know whether or not he was your boyfriend. You had been seeing each other for the past three months, yet he had never said as much, and you had never asked. <br></p><p>\u201cI like your skirt.\u201d He nodded towards your long, floaty skirt. It was decorated in jewel toned embroidery; greens and purples and oranges. You smiled and thanked him.<br></p><p>\u201cShall we walk this way?\u201d Taehyung indicated down a narrow, winding path which led towards a cluster of trees. You nodded and had to stop yourself from letting out a mutter of surprise as he reached down and took your hand in his. You walked towards the park in silence, passing several other couples and families before you met the thick line of trees. <br></p><p>Eventually, he spoke. \u201cI liked your play.\u201d <br></p><p>You frowned, confused. \u201cWhich one?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cHamlet. At the Jeongdong.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou made a great Ophelia.\u201d <br></p><p>Your forehead wrinkled even further. \u201cYou saw my play? When?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cLast Thursday.\u201d <br></p><p>You let out a small laugh, without much humour. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were going? We could have done something afterwards.\u201d</p><p>He looked at you. \u201cI thought you were probably busy.\u201d <br></p><p>You shook your head as you turned a corner and passed a small, stone carving by the side of the path. \u201cI could have at least seen you\u2026said hello.\u201d You sighed before deciding to let it drop. \u201cI\u2019m playing Honey in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf next\u2026at the National. We start practising in two weeks.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You turn another bend in the path and find yourself passing a small fish pond. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the play. I enjoyed the film. Elizabeth Taylor was great.\u201d <br></p><p>You glance at the small body of water and watch the shimmery gold and piebald yellow carp as they swim just below the surface.\u00a0\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be away again by the time it is on.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cAway?\u201d He turned to glance at you. <br></p><p>\u201cOn tour. You\u2019re going to America.\u201d <br></p><p>He paused. \u201cOh yeah. I forgot.\u201d He sounded a little sad. The pond ended and you passed a group of wooden benches, scattered between the trees. There was an elderly couple seated at one, holding hands as they watched the fish in the pond from a distance. Without really thinking, you squeezed Taehyung\u2019s hand tighter. He looked down at you as you smiled. <br></p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d You made a small gesture to the pair on the bench but kept your voice a whisper. \u201cCute old couple.\u201d <br></p><p>His expression was incredibly gentle beneath the canopy of green trees. \u201cThey look so content.\u201d He held your hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\n hope I\u2019m as happy as they look when I\u2019m their age.\u201d You said quietly, \npassing by them. They dissapeared from view as you turned another \ncorner. The path branched off into three lanes. You chose the left \nstrand. You became aware that the number of people you passed was \ngrowing less and less every minuite as you walked deeper into the \nparkland. <br></p><p>Taehyung moved your hand to his lips and pressed a \nkiss to your knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be.\u201d You continued walking for\n another five minutes in silence, evetually letting go of his hand and \nwalking side by side, before you finally broke the quiet. <br></p><p>\u201cI \nwasn\u2019t sure you wanted to see me again.\u201d You admitted as you turned down\n another path. \u201cI thought maybe you didn\u2019t like me that much.\u201d You \nshrugged. <br></p><p>There was a pause before he spoke. \u201cOf course I like you.\u201d He sounded confused.<br></p><p>You\n glanced at him. He looked beautiful in the shade. \u201cI just \nthought\u2026since we haven\u2019t spoken for a while.\u201d You gathered your thoughts. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what I \nmeant to you. Whether we were dating, or\u2026?\u201d <br></p><p>He looked puzzled, his gaze dropping to his shoes as you both subconsciously slowed your speed. \u201cI\u2019d have said we were dating.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been intimate.\u201d <br></p><p>You felt your cheeks redden. \u201cYes.\u201d You agreed, remembering how you had taken him in your mouth and how his fingers had pressed against your opening, sinking into you until you gasped into his open mouth. You didn\u2019t question his reasoning. You thought plenty of people would be happy to be intimate with someone without dating them. You took a quick glance at Taehyung and noted how, unlike yourself, he didn\u2019t seem embarassed. His warm, caramel coloured skin seemed to glow in the sunlight as the trees parted into a clearing. There was another small pond surrounded by a low brick wall. There was no one else in sight. You hadn\u2019t seen another person now for over half an hour.<br></p><p>He reached over to you and took your hand in his once more, leading you around the edge of the pond and back into the canopy of trees at the far side of the clearing. Another minute passed before you spoke. \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d <br></p><p>He shook his head softly. \u201cNo.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You briefly looked around you. \u201cDo you think you can get us back?\u201d <br></p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sure I can.\u201d He turned to look at you. \u201cAre you worried?\u201d <br></p><p>Your eyes met his. \u201cNo.\u201d He looked incredibly beautiful. You sighed, leaning in to meet his lips. His mouth touched yours gently as you turned your head and pressed yourself closer. In unison, you parted your lips to allow your tongues to meet. His right hand came around the back of your head and brushed through your hair, holding you against him. His other hand left your own and moved to brush your cheekbone as his tongue brushed against yours.

You felt your heart thud in your chest, despite yourself, and took a deep breath as you approached him, tugging down the hem of your plain white camisole and adjusting the strap of the fabric tote bag on your shoulder.<br></p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d You called from behind him. He turned around at the sound of your voice, away from the crowd. He looked a little dazed for a moment, before he smiled softly. <br></p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d Without warning, he leaned down and kissed you gently on the lips. He had pulled away before you had time to register what had happened, but you felt your heart thud once more and you had to force yourself to close your mouth. He laughed gently at your reaction as you looked away from him to the floor. It wasn\u2019t like you had never kissed him before. In fact, you had done a little more than kiss in the past. It was just that, until he had texted you yesterday evening asking if you wished to go for a walk in the woods by \nChangdeokgung Palace, you had not spoken for three weeks. If you were honest with yourself, the fault also lied in yourself. You had decided not to text or message him until he did so first and so the stalemate began. You didn\u2019t even know whether or not he was your boyfriend. You had been seeing each other for the past three months, yet he had never said as much, and you had never asked. <br></p><p>\u201cI like your skirt.\u201d He nodded towards your long, floaty skirt. It was decorated in jewel toned embroidery; greens and purples and oranges. You smiled and thanked him.<br></p><p>\u201cShall we walk this way?\u201d Taehyung indicated down a narrow, winding path which led towards a cluster of trees. You nodded and had to stop yourself from letting out a mutter of surprise as he reached down and took your hand in his. You walked towards the park in silence, passing several other couples and families before you met the thick line of trees. <br></p><p>Eventually, he spoke. \u201cI liked your play.\u201d <br></p><p>You frowned, confused. \u201cWhich one?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cHamlet. At the Jeongdong.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou made a great Ophelia.\u201d <br></p><p>Your forehead wrinkled even further. \u201cYou saw my play? When?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cLast Thursday.\u201d <br></p><p>You let out a small laugh, without much humour. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were going? We could have done something afterwards.\u201d</p><p>He looked at you. \u201cI thought you were probably busy.\u201d <br></p><p>You shook your head as you turned a corner and passed a small, stone carving by the side of the path. \u201cI could have at least seen you\u2026said hello.\u201d You sighed before deciding to let it drop. \u201cI\u2019m playing Honey in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf next\u2026at the National. We start practising in two weeks.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You turn another bend in the path and find yourself passing a small fish pond. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the play. I enjoyed the film. Elizabeth Taylor was great.\u201d <br></p><p>You glance at the small body of water and watch the shimmery gold and piebald yellow carp as they swim just below the surface.\u00a0\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be away again by the time it is on.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cAway?\u201d He turned to glance at you. <br></p><p>\u201cOn tour. You\u2019re going to America.\u201d <br></p><p>He paused. \u201cOh yeah. I forgot.\u201d He sounded a little sad. The pond ended and you passed a group of wooden benches, scattered between the trees. There was an elderly couple seated at one, holding hands as they watched the fish in the pond from a distance. Without really thinking, you squeezed Taehyung\u2019s hand tighter. He looked down at you as you smiled. <br></p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d You made a small gesture to the pair on the bench but kept your voice a whisper. \u201cCute old couple.\u201d <br></p><p>His expression was incredibly gentle beneath the canopy of green trees. \u201cThey look so content.\u201d He held your hand tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\n hope I\u2019m as happy as they look when I\u2019m their age.\u201d You said quietly, \npassing by them. They dissapeared from view as you turned another \ncorner. The path branched off into three lanes. You chose the left \nstrand. You became aware that the number of people you passed was \ngrowing less and less every minuite as you walked deeper into the \nparkland. <br></p><p>Taehyung moved your hand to his lips and pressed a \nkiss to your knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be.\u201d You continued walking for\n another five minutes in silence, evetually letting go of his hand and \nwalking side by side, before you finally broke the quiet. <br></p><p>\u201cI \nwasn\u2019t sure you wanted to see me again.\u201d You admitted as you turned down\n another path. \u201cI thought maybe you didn\u2019t like me that much.\u201d You \nshrugged. <br></p><p>There was a pause before he spoke. \u201cOf course I like you.\u201d He sounded confused.<br></p><p>You\n glanced at him. He looked beautiful in the shade. \u201cI just \nthought\u2026since we haven\u2019t spoken for a while.\u201d You gathered your thoughts. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what I \nmeant to you. Whether we were dating, or\u2026?\u201d <br></p><p>He looked puzzled, his gaze dropping to his shoes as you both subconsciously slowed your speed. \u201cI\u2019d have said we were dating.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been intimate.\u201d <br></p><p>You felt your cheeks redden. \u201cYes.\u201d You agreed, remembering how you had taken him in your mouth and how his fingers had pressed against your opening, sinking into you until you gasped into his open mouth. You didn\u2019t question his reasoning. You thought plenty of people would be happy to be intimate with someone without dating them. You took a quick glance at Taehyung and noted how, unlike yourself, he didn\u2019t seem embarassed. His warm, caramel coloured skin seemed to glow in the sunlight as the trees parted into a clearing. There was another small pond surrounded by a low brick wall. There was no one else in sight. You hadn\u2019t seen another person now for over half an hour.<br></p><p>He reached over to you and took your hand in his once more, leading you around the edge of the pond and back into the canopy of trees at the far side of the clearing. Another minute passed before you spoke. \u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d <br></p><p>He shook his head softly. \u201cNo.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You briefly looked around you. \u201cDo you think you can get us back?\u201d <br></p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sure I can.\u201d He turned to look at you. \u201cAre you worried?\u201d <br></p><p>Your eyes met his. \u201cNo.\u201d He looked incredibly beautiful. You sighed, leaning in to meet his lips. His mouth touched yours gently as you turned your head and pressed yourself closer. In unison, you parted your lips to allow your tongues to meet. His right hand came around the back of your head and brushed through your hair, holding you against him. His other hand left your own and moved to brush your cheekbone as his tongue brushed against yours. You quickly felt your breath increasing as he kissed you like this; it felt incredibly sexy and, had you not been completely confident that you were alone, you would have felt exposed and indecent. As it happened, having him confirm his feelings for you after months of uncertainty had been enough to make you ache for him. You had forgotten, in the three weeks apart, how good he had made you feel the last time you were alone together. You thought that every time his eyes moved across your features, he made you feel like Helen of Troy. You had never felt more desirable with someone before.<br></p><p>You moaned into his mouth as his palm left your face and brushed the white strap of your camisole down your shoulder, causing the strap of your tote bag to drop to the crook of your elbow. He paused to caress your upper arm gently before repeating the motion with your other strap. You both moved off the loosely marked path without thinking, him leading you backwards until your back pressed against the trunk of a tree. You moved your hands to tug the thin, white material of his shirt from the waistband of his linen trousers. They were tucked in loosely and the shirt came free easily. You ran your hands along his bare stomach, over his bellybutton and delighted in the small sounds he made as your hands came in contact with his skin. Slowly, you moved your palm lower, not really thinking about what you were doing until your hand skimmed along his clothed erection. Like the shirt, the linen pants were very thin and, you fancied, you could feel every vein and groove through his underwear. He groaned loudly into your open mouth before pulling his lips away from yours to look at you. He gazed down through thick eyelashes and you felt your own breath hitch in reply. His desire for you was obvious but he moved his eyes from yours to briefly look around the open space, cautiously. You were no longer in view of the small path but the trees here were still widely spread out. <br></p><p>Slowly, he reached down for your hand and led you over a small incline in the forest floor. The hill soon levelled out before dropping again. You followed him back down until the ground was level again. You thought that even if somebody did walk past on the main path, they would not be able to see or hear you from their vantage. His hands and mouth were back on you as you allowed yourself to be lowered onto the floor, dropping your canvas bag to the side. The ground was mossy and a little spongy, supporting and cushioning your body surprisingly well. You moved your hands beneath you to push aside a few twigs as he joined you. <br></p><p>You thought he might protest as you hitched up the hem of your long, loosely fitting skirt and tugged down your plain, pink panties. After all, this was not the most comfortable place to be fucking, even if it wasn\u2019t your first time together. He simply kissed you passionately in return, however, as you ran your hands along his waistband once more. The air was warm and everything felt still and silent; you would have been able to hear a pin drop in that moment. Despite everything, you thought it felt right that you should do it here and now. You didn\u2019t think you would be able to wait to find your way back to the tourist site anyhow, and you certainly didn\u2019t think you would be able to recapture this moment of utter stillness and silence later in his third story apartment in the middle of Gangnam. <br></p><p>He ran his hand along your right leg, starting at your calf and ending at your upper thigh as he leaned over you. You reached over to the colourful fabric of your bag and unlatched the magnetic button. You felt inside with one hand, the other slowly pulling the white cord of Taehyung\u2019s trousers until the small bow came undone. You found your wallet amongst a few cosmetics and an empty plastic bottle of Coca Cola and pulled it out, quickly snapping open the button which held it closed and reaching inside of the flaps for a condom. Taehyung raised his eyebrow, briefly, a small smile playing on his lips as you pulled out the small square foil and tore the edge. Reaching forward as he balanced himself above you, you pulled down his white linen trousers and plain, cotton underwear to free his erection. As remembered, he was both longer and thicker than you had initially anticipated and you found yourself admiring him through your eyelashes, your mouth lulling open as you pinched the tip of the latex and rolled it onto him slowly. He moaned as your hand grasped him, guiding him to the space between your thighs. <br></p><p>He sank into you slowly. It felt a little uncomfortable due to his size and the lack of preparation, but he anticipated this as he paused. <br></p><p>\u201cIs it too much?\u201d He whispered. <br></p><p>You shook your head and pecked his lips, once. He moved one hand to your face and stroked your cheek a little roughly with his thumb before burying himself fully. You gasped together, pressing your faces close. <br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d You reassured him as he gazed down at you. \u201cYou feel good\u2026\u201d He hesitated for a moment before moving his hips against you, pulling almost all of the way out before pushing back inside. You felt him stretch you; could feel the tip of his cock pressing and brushing against your sensitive walls as he fucked you slowly, all the while watching your expression with slightly parted lips. You moved your head upwards to meet his lips. His hands trailed to your hips as he pushed his pelvis against the backs of your thighs; thrusting into you as far as he could go. You moaned breathily as he increased his speed. You suddenly heard the flapping of wings somewhere above your head, in the canopy of trees as a bird took flight. You thought Taehyung might have suddenly become aware of his surroundings as he pushed against you, now practically slamming into you in an attempt to reach his high. You held onto his shoulders tightly as he moved his mouth towards your chest and began to kiss along your breasts, above the fringe of your camisole; in wet, open mouthed kisses. <br></p><p>You felt him shudder against you as his hips snapped against you frantically. His lips met yours once again and he moaned loudly into your open mouth as you held him. His eyelashes fluttered against his cheeks like the delicate wings of a moth as he came. You felt him twitch inside you and he held you still for a moment, savouring the sensation, before slowly pulling out of you. He reached down, between your slightly damp thighs, to grasp the condom as he withdrew. You exhaled in a long, deep breath as he moved away from you, turning away from you to remove the condom. You took a moment to gather yourself, suddenly feeling a little ridiculous as you looked at your surroundings and a little ashamed at your lack of self control. You sighed and reached for your discarded underwear, slipping them back on and rolling your skirt back down over your bare knees. <br></p><p>Taehyung had knotted the condom and held it in one hand. He reached for your hand with the other and, with a sweet smile, pulled you to your feet. You brushed your cami and skirt down, smoothing out the fabric as you looked at him, your cheeks and chest flushed. He flashed his teeth in a grin as he reached with his spare hand and pulled a few twigs and leaves from your brunette hair. <br></p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d You said, reaching down to pick up your wallet and tote bag. \u201cHere\u2026\u201d You reached into your bag and produced the empty bottle of Cola. \u201cI don\u2019t want you littering.\u201d You kept a straight face, still feeling a little bashful as Taehyung took it from you and discarded the used condom in the bottle. You hid it back in your bag, promising yourself that you would get rid of it as soon as you passed a litter bin. He took your hand gently in his as he lead you back up the gentle slope and towards the deserted forest path. <br></p><p>\u201cDoes this mean I can call you my boyfriend?\u201d You asked after a few minutes. You had once more passed the small fish pond and thought you would be able to make it back to the tourist path before it got too late and started to get dark. <br></p><p>He turned to look at you and grinned. His eyes crinkled at the corners as he flashed his teeth. You felt your chest ache once more at how sweet he looked, in the warm light of the afternoon. \u201cI hope so.\u201d He squeezed your hand tightly. \u201cI hope I get to see your play\u2026\u201d <br></p><p>You paused. \u201cHmm?\u201d Questioning.</p><p>\u201cVirginia Woolf. I hope I get to see it before I go to America.\u201d <br></p><p>You smiled and nodded. \u201cI hope so too.\u201d You stood on your tiptoes and kissed his cheek, inhaling his gentle, vetiver scent as you walked along the quiet path, hand in hand. <br></p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you so much for reading.

He looked beautiful in the shade. &ldquo;I just \nthought&hellip;since we haven&rsquo;t spoken for a while.&rdquo; You gathered your thoughts. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I \nmeant to you. Whether we were dating, or&hellip;?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>He looked puzzled, his gaze dropping to his shoes as you both subconsciously slowed your speed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have said we were dating.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been intimate.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>You felt your cheeks redden. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; You agreed, remembering how you had taken him in your mouth and how his fingers had pressed against your opening, sinking into you until you gasped into his open mouth. You didn&rsquo;t question his reasoning. You thought plenty of people would be happy to be intimate with someone without dating them. You took a quick glance at Taehyung and noted how, unlike yourself, he didn&rsquo;t seem embarassed. His warm, caramel coloured skin seemed to glow in the sunlight as the trees parted into a clearing. There was another small pond surrounded by a low brick wall. There was no one else in sight. You hadn&rsquo;t seen another person now for over half an hour.<br /></p><p>He reached over to you and took your hand in his once more, leading you around the edge of the pond and back into the canopy of trees at the far side of the clearing. Another minute passed before you spoke. &ldquo;Do you know where we are?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>He shook his head softly. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; You briefly looked around you. &ldquo;Do you think you can get us back?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>He thought for a moment. &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m sure I can.&rdquo; He turned to look at you. &ldquo;Are you worried?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>Your eyes met his. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He looked incredibly beautiful. You sighed, leaning in to meet his lips. His mouth touched yours gently as you turned your head and pressed yourself closer. In unison, you parted your lips to allow your tongues to meet. His right hand came around the back of your head and brushed through your hair, holding you against him. His other hand left your own and moved to brush your cheekbone as his tongue brushed against yours. You quickly felt your breath increasing as he kissed you like this; it felt incredibly sexy and, had you not been completely confident that you were alone, you would have felt exposed and indecent. As it happened, having him confirm his feelings for you after months of uncertainty had been enough to make you ache for him. You had forgotten, in the three weeks apart, how good he had made you feel the last time you were alone together. You thought that every time his eyes moved across your features, he made you feel like Helen of Troy. You had never felt more desirable with someone before.<br /></p><p>You moaned into his mouth as his palm left your face and brushed the white strap of your camisole down your shoulder, causing the strap of your tote bag to drop to the crook of your elbow. He paused to caress your upper arm gently before repeating the motion with your other strap. You both moved off the loosely marked path without thinking, him leading you backwards until your back pressed against the trunk of a tree. You moved your hands to tug the thin, white material of his shirt from the waistband of his linen trousers. They were tucked in loosely and the shirt came free easily. You ran your hands along his bare stomach, over his bellybutton and delighted in the small sounds he made as your hands came in contact with his skin. Slowly, you moved your palm lower, not really thinking about what you were doing until your hand skimmed along his clothed erection. Like the shirt, the linen pants were very thin and, you fancied, you could feel every vein and groove through his underwear. He groaned loudly into your open mouth before pulling his lips away from yours to look at you. He gazed down through thick eyelashes and you felt your own breath hitch in reply. His desire for you was obvious but he moved his eyes from yours to briefly look around the open space, cautiously. You were no longer in view of the small path but the trees here were still widely spread out. <br /></p><p>Slowly, he reached down for your hand and led you over a small incline in the forest floor. The hill soon levelled out before dropping again. You followed him back down until the ground was level again. You thought that even if somebody did walk past on the main path, they would not be able to see or hear you from their vantage. His hands and mouth were back on you as you allowed yourself to be lowered onto the floor, dropping your canvas bag to the side. The ground was mossy and a little spongy, supporting and cushioning your body surprisingly well. You moved your hands beneath you to push aside a few twigs as he joined you. <br /></p><p>You thought he might protest as you hitched up the hem of your long, loosely fitting skirt and tugged down your plain, pink panties. After all, this was not the most comfortable place to be fucking, even if it wasn&rsquo;t your first time together. He simply kissed you passionately in return, however, as you ran your hands along his waistband once more. The air was warm and everything felt still and silent; you would have been able to hear a pin drop in that moment. Despite everything, you thought it felt right that you should do it here and now. You didn&rsquo;t think you would be able to wait to find your way back to the tourist site anyhow, and you certainly didn&rsquo;t think you would be able to recapture this moment of utter stillness and silence later in his third story apartment in the middle of Gangnam. <br /></p><p>He ran his hand along your right leg, starting at your calf and ending at your upper thigh as he leaned over you. You reached over to the colourful fabric of your bag and unlatched the magnetic button. You felt inside with one hand, the other slowly pulling the white cord of Taehyung&rsquo;s trousers until the small bow came undone. You found your wallet amongst a few cosmetics and an empty plastic bottle of Coca Cola and pulled it out, quickly snapping open the button which held it closed and reaching inside of the flaps for a condom. Taehyung raised his eyebrow, briefly, a small smile playing on his lips as you pulled out the small square foil and tore the edge. Reaching forward as he balanced himself above you, you pulled down his white linen trousers and plain, cotton underwear to free his erection. As remembered, he was both longer and thicker than you had initially anticipated and you found yourself admiring him through your eyelashes, your mouth lulling open as you pinched the tip of the latex and rolled it onto him slowly. He moaned as your hand grasped him, guiding him to the space between your thighs. <br /></p><p>He sank into you slowly. It felt a little uncomfortable due to his size and the lack of preparation, but he anticipated this as he paused. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is it too much?&rdquo; He whispered. <br /></p><p>You shook your head and pecked his lips, once. He moved one hand to your face and stroked your cheek a little roughly with his thumb before burying himself fully. You gasped together, pressing your faces close. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; You reassured him as he gazed down at you. &ldquo;You feel good&hellip;&rdquo; He hesitated for a moment before moving his hips against you, pulling almost all of the way out before pushing back inside. You felt him stretch you; could feel the tip of his cock pressing and brushing against your sensitive walls as he fucked you slowly, all the while watching your expression with slightly parted lips. You moved your head upwards to meet his lips. His hands trailed to your hips as he pushed his pelvis against the backs of your thighs; thrusting into you as far as he could go. You moaned breathily as he increased his speed. You suddenly heard the flapping of wings somewhere above your head, in the canopy of trees as a bird took flight. You thought Taehyung might have suddenly become aware of his surroundings as he pushed against you, now practically slamming into you in an attempt to reach his high. You held onto his shoulders tightly as he moved his mouth towards your chest and began to kiss along your breasts, above the fringe of your camisole; in wet, open mouthed kisses. <br /></p><p>You felt him shudder against you as his hips snapped against you frantically. His lips met yours once again and he moaned loudly into your open mouth as you held him. His eyelashes fluttered against his cheeks like the delicate wings of a moth as he came. You felt him twitch inside you and he held you still for a moment, savouring the sensation, before slowly pulling out of you. He reached down, between your slightly damp thighs, to grasp the condom as he withdrew. You exhaled in a long, deep breath as he moved away from you, turning away from you to remove the condom. You took a moment to gather yourself, suddenly feeling a little ridiculous as you looked at your surroundings and a little ashamed at your lack of self control. You sighed and reached for your discarded underwear, slipping them back on and rolling your skirt back down over your bare knees. <br /></p><p>Taehyung had knotted the condom and held it in one hand. He reached for your hand with the other and, with a sweet smile, pulled you to your feet. You brushed your cami and skirt down, smoothing out the fabric as you looked at him, your cheeks and chest flushed. He flashed his teeth in a grin as he reached with his spare hand and pulled a few twigs and leaves from your brunette hair. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; You said, reaching down to pick up your wallet and tote bag. &ldquo;Here&hellip;&rdquo; You reached into your bag and produced the empty bottle of Cola. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you littering.&rdquo; You kept a straight face, still feeling a little bashful as Taehyung took it from you and discarded the used condom in the bottle. You hid it back in your bag, promising yourself that you would get rid of it as soon as you passed a litter bin. He took your hand gently in his as he lead you back up the gentle slope and towards the deserted forest path. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Does this mean I can call you my boyfriend?&rdquo; You asked after a few minutes. You had once more passed the small fish pond and thought you would be able to make it back to the tourist path before it got too late and started to get dark. <br /></p><p>He turned to look at you and grinned. His eyes crinkled at the corners as he flashed his teeth. You felt your chest ache once more at how sweet he looked, in the warm light of the afternoon. &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; He squeezed your hand tightly. &ldquo;I hope I get to see your play&hellip;&rdquo; <br /></p><p>You paused. &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; Questioning.</p><p>&ldquo;Virginia Woolf. I hope I get to see it before I go to America.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>You smiled and nodded. &ldquo;I hope so too.&rdquo; You stood on your tiptoes and kissed his cheek, inhaling his gentle, vetiver scent as you walked along the quiet path, hand in hand. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>***</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you so much for reading.

Following what happened last week with you and Jimin, today was the first time you were out and about for a purpose that wasn\u2019t just eating at the dining hall or going to class. You weren\u2019t feeling the best about yourself but once you walked into the dance studio and saw everyone\u2019s face light up at your appearance, you felt at ease.</p><p>\u201cy/n!\u201d Hoseok tackled you in a hug, squeezing you tightly. You laughed, hugging him back with a smile. \u201cHow are you feeling? This week was kind of a toll on you, yeah?\u201d Hoseok\u2019s voice didn\u2019t seem to have an underlying tone of anything else like it usually did, so you felt easier around him today. You nodded, pulling away a bit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a little rough, but I thought I shouldn\u2019t skip rehearsal because I might miss a lot and you guys make me feel better.\u201d Jimin\u2019s face lit up at this comment, a smile that made his eyes disappear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna start off with an old routine, yeah? You can chill with Kev and Tae for now, I think 2Jin are gonna come a little later, maybe with Joon?\u201d Hoseok pursed his lips, guiding you to where Kevin and Taehyung were sitting. Kevin was on his phone, but nonetheless opened his arms up so he could hug you from behind. Kevin\u2019s arms rested around your shoulders, swaying you along as the trio (3J, they called themselves) started running over some bits that were kind of muddy to themselves. You could barely concentrate on Hoseok and Jimin dancing &ndash; your eyes were focused on how your coconut headed stats partner was in the middle for the first song, his usual bunny smile replaced by a brooding look that could make anyone weak to their knees. </p><p>You only snapped out of your trance when you saw a figure open the door and announce she brought some snacks for everyone, but even if your head registered the voice as Jinhee\u2019s, she did not look like Jinhee anymore. </p><p>No, instead of the silver it was yesterday when you saw her in the dining hall, her hair was now a bright pink-purple, making almost everyone in the room confused. </p><p>\u201cDid you like&hellip;give head to a unicorn, what made you dye your hair?\u201d Taehyung asked in awe as you and Kevin gave it a casual lookover and a thumbs up, being used to her random dyeing sprees by now.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019ll give a unicorn head and not me? Boo.\u201d Jimin pouted at Jinhee, who didn\u2019t seem to pay the comment any attention. </p><p>\u201cI was just bored of my hair. After my shift last night I just bleached and dyed my hair because I mean, not like I was gonna sleep or anything.\u201d She shrugged, leaving the snack bag and her backpack next to you and Kevin before toeing off her shoes and shrugging off her coat. \u201cI think Seokjin\u2019s coming soon, Joon can\u2019t because he has a meeting with the dean or something.\u201d She plopped herself down, opening the swirl ice cream and casually eating it. You opted for the hot chips in the bag, sharing with Kevin as the three standing started to get into formation. You didn\u2019t even realize Taehyung had gone to do their music until he was running back, the intro of <i>Don\u2019t Wanna Fall In Love</i> by Kyle started playing on the speaker. </p><p>You found it really surprising how well the three of them worked together despite their differences in dance style. You noticed that even if Jimin\u2019s dance style lagged a little, it was more sensual and very contrasting to how sharp Jungkook\u2019s movement was.</p><p>Speaking of Jungkook, it was hard to make other observations of the others dancing when all you could do was focus on Jungkook. Something about the way he looked really got you in a trance, the way he looked up from his bangs threatening to spill over his eyes, but also the duality when he wasn\u2019t dancing anymore and he gave you the cute little bunny smile that you were used to.</p><p>\u201cJimin! Your dancing was so fluid!\u201d Jinhee seemed to have stars in her eyes when she ran up to Jimin, who only smirked back at her, tilting her chin up maintain eye contact with her. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this Jimin, hm? You should follow y/n\u2019s lead and call me oppa.\u201d He swiped his thumb across her lips with a wink, making her tense up and shiver. </p><p>\u201cW-what are you talking about?? You\u2019re barely 5 days older than me shut up!\u201d Her face was red as she stomped back to the side, you and Kevin laughing your asses off at how quickly Jinhee had deflected the baffled Jimin. While the two of you were laughing incredibly hard, the door opened once more, and everyone\u2019s attention turned to who had just walked in. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with both of the music majors and consistently dyeing their hair?\u201d Jimin furrowed his brows, pointing at Yoongi\u2019s newly dyed mint hair. Once Jinhee and Yoongi met eyes, they almost seemed to have a comedic Spiderman meme moment, pointing at each other confusedly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called the depression, Jimin, get on board with it.\u201d Yoongi pursed his lips, sitting closer to Taehyung and Kevin rather than you and Jinhee. Seokjin made a face at Yoongi, before looking at the other musician before snorting.</p><p>\u201cOh cute, they\u2019re grapes\u201d Seokjin laughed at his own observation, taking off his shoes before walking across the marley to meet the ones sitting out. Hoseok had called the rest of WINGS onto the dance floor, beginning to work on new choreography with them. You began to get back into the flow of dancing again, the rest of the group falling back into the routine. Hoseok was busy teaching the choreography to everyone, and occasionally while you guys danced, Seokjin and Jinhee hyped you guys along, some <i>AYY GO OFF Y/N!</i> or <i>OKAAAAAAAYYYYY TAEHYUNG HIT IT!</i> coming from the two in the corner. Yoongi looked like he was losing brain cells by being around them, but the smile on his face really said otherwise. </p><p>You felt all the stress from the last week dissipate as you danced more, the emotions rolling off of you as well. By the end of rehearsal, you felt way better than how you felt when you walked in. As everyone was getting ready to leave, you gave everyone hugs, thanking them for the hard work.</p><p>\u201cWant to walk back to the dorm together, y/n? It\u2019s kinda late and I wanna just run over what we need to know for our stats quiz tomorrow\u2026\u201d Jungkook smiled sheepishly, scratching his head. You nodded, getting your coat on and waving goodbye to everyone else in the dance room. </p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re up next, yeah?\u201d Hoseok and Seokjin waved to the five left in the room. Seokjin blowing a kiss to Jinhee (who only took it and threw it on the ground, stomping it), and Hoseok just did his signature smile, leaving with his flatmate. Kevin and Taehyung were already talking about their shared Introduction to Neuroscience course, waiting near the door for the other three to be ready so they could do one last check of the room before leaving. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s drop Jinhee off first, you\u2019re along the way, right?\u201d Taehyung inquired, Jinhee nodding as she tied her laces so that they could leave. Kevin helped her back up from her squat, a small thank you escaping as they all went to put on their coats. </p><p>The walk home was relatively quiet for everyone, mainly because they were walking faster than normal through the cold of campus to get to the dorms. Taehyung and Kevin were in a heated discussion about one person in their class who they both just wanted to sock in their class, Jimin and Yoongi were talking about his cat, Killmonger, and Jinhee was trailing behind them, spacing out. </p><p>A block away from Jinhee\u2019s dorm (across the street from the other four), Jimin had noticed that Jinhee had been a lot more quiet than usual, making him stop and let her catch up to him and Yoongi. He tilted his head sideways, making her conscious of him looking of her. Her face turned red, she looked away before peeking back at Jimin to see if he ever broke eye contact with her. Jimin chuckled a little, sliding his hand into hers, the two of them forgetting Yoongi being there.</p><p>\u201cYou okay Jinhee?\u201d Jimin squeezed her hand gently, Jinhee nodding before letting out a yawn. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little tired, is all. I have the night off tonight so hopefully I can sleep tonight.\u201d Jinhee pulled out her ID, since they were stopped in front of her dorm. She squeezed Jimin\u2019s hand back, bidding everyone a goodnight, and additionally, a small apologetic smile to Yoongi, who\u2019s face only flushed at her small gesture. The only person who had caught that besides the two of them was Jimin, and that only made him grin mischievously. Him flirting with Jinhee just got a lot more\u2026 interesting, to say in the least.</p><p><i>2-18-19</i></p>",

You could barely concentrate on Hoseok and Jimin dancing \u2013 your eyes were focused on how your coconut headed stats partner was in the middle for the first song, his usual bunny smile replaced by a brooding look that could make anyone weak to their knees. </p><p>You only snapped out of your trance when you saw a figure open the door and announce she brought some snacks for everyone, but even if your head registered the voice as Jinhee\u2019s, she did not look like Jinhee anymore. </p><p>No, instead of the silver it was yesterday when you saw her in the dining hall, her hair was now a bright pink-purple, making almost everyone in the room confused. </p><p>\u201cDid you like\u2026give head to a unicorn, what made you dye your hair?\u201d Taehyung asked in awe as you and Kevin gave it a casual lookover and a thumbs up, being used to her random dyeing sprees by now.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019ll give a unicorn head and not me? Boo.\u201d Jimin pouted at Jinhee, who didn\u2019t seem to pay the comment any attention. </p><p>\u201cI was just bored of my hair. After my shift last night I just bleached and dyed my hair because I mean, not like I was gonna sleep or anything.\u201d She shrugged, leaving the snack bag and her backpack next to you and Kevin before toeing off her shoes and shrugging off her coat. \u201cI think Seokjin\u2019s coming soon, Joon can\u2019t because he has a meeting with the dean or something.\u201d She plopped herself down, opening the swirl ice cream and casually eating it. You opted for the hot chips in the bag, sharing with Kevin as the three standing started to get into formation. You didn\u2019t even realize Taehyung had gone to do their music until he was running back, the intro of <i>Don\u2019t Wanna Fall In Love</i> by Kyle started playing on the speaker. </p><p>You found it really surprising how well the three of them worked together despite their differences in dance style. You noticed that even if Jimin\u2019s dance style lagged a little, it was more sensual and very contrasting to how sharp Jungkook\u2019s movement was.</p><p>Speaking of Jungkook, it was hard to make other observations of the others dancing when all you could do was focus on Jungkook. Something about the way he looked really got you in a trance, the way he looked up from his bangs threatening to spill over his eyes, but also the duality when he wasn\u2019t dancing anymore and he gave you the cute little bunny smile that you were used to.</p><p>\u201cJimin! Your dancing was so fluid!\u201d Jinhee seemed to have stars in her eyes when she ran up to Jimin, who only smirked back at her, tilting her chin up maintain eye contact with her. </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this Jimin, hm? You should follow y/n\u2019s lead and call me oppa.\u201d He swiped his thumb across her lips with a wink, making her tense up and shiver. </p><p>\u201cW-what are you talking about?? You\u2019re barely 5 days older than me shut up!\u201d Her face was red as she stomped back to the side, you and Kevin laughing your asses off at how quickly Jinhee had deflected the baffled Jimin. While the two of you were laughing incredibly hard, the door opened once more, and everyone\u2019s attention turned to who had just walked in. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with both of the music majors and consistently dyeing their hair?\u201d Jimin furrowed his brows, pointing at Yoongi\u2019s newly dyed mint hair. Once Jinhee and Yoongi met eyes, they almost seemed to have a comedic Spiderman meme moment, pointing at each other confusedly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called the depression, Jimin, get on board with it.\u201d Yoongi pursed his lips, sitting closer to Taehyung and Kevin rather than you and Jinhee. Seokjin made a face at Yoongi, before looking at the other musician before snorting.</p><p>\u201cOh cute, they\u2019re grapes\u201d Seokjin laughed at his own observation, taking off his shoes before walking across the marley to meet the ones sitting out. Hoseok had called the rest of WINGS onto the dance floor, beginning to work on new choreography with them. You began to get back into the flow of dancing again, the rest of the group falling back into the routine. Hoseok was busy teaching the choreography to everyone, and occasionally while you guys danced, Seokjin and Jinhee hyped you guys along, some <i>AYY GO OFF Y/N!</i> or <i>OKAAAAAAAYYYYY TAEHYUNG HIT IT!</i> coming from the two in the corner. Yoongi looked like he was losing brain cells by being around them, but the smile on his face really said otherwise. </p><p>You felt all the stress from the last week dissipate as you danced more, the emotions rolling off of you as well. By the end of rehearsal, you felt way better than how you felt when you walked in. As everyone was getting ready to leave, you gave everyone hugs, thanking them for the hard work.</p><p>\u201cWant to walk back to the dorm together, y/n? It\u2019s kinda late and I wanna just run over what we need to know for our stats quiz tomorrow\u2026\u201d Jungkook smiled sheepishly, scratching his head. You nodded, getting your coat on and waving goodbye to everyone else in the dance room. </p><p>\u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re up next, yeah?\u201d Hoseok and Seokjin waved to the five left in the room. Seokjin blowing a kiss to Jinhee (who only took it and threw it on the ground, stomping it), and Hoseok just did his signature smile, leaving with his flatmate. Kevin and Taehyung were already talking about their shared Introduction to Neuroscience course, waiting near the door for the other three to be ready so they could do one last check of the room before leaving. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s drop Jinhee off first, you\u2019re along the way, right?\u201d Taehyung inquired, Jinhee nodding as she tied her laces so that they could leave. Kevin helped her back up from her squat, a small thank you escaping as they all went to put on their coats. </p><p>The walk home was relatively quiet for everyone, mainly because they were walking faster than normal through the cold of campus to get to the dorms. Taehyung and Kevin were in a heated discussion about one person in their class who they both just wanted to sock in their class, Jimin and Yoongi were talking about his cat, Killmonger, and Jinhee was trailing behind them, spacing out. </p><p>A block away from Jinhee\u2019s dorm (across the street from the other four), Jimin had noticed that Jinhee had been a lot more quiet than usual, making him stop and let her catch up to him and Yoongi. He tilted his head sideways, making her conscious of him looking of her. Her face turned red, she looked away before peeking back at Jimin to see if he ever broke eye contact with her. Jimin chuckled a little, sliding his hand into hers, the two of them forgetting Yoongi being there.</p><p>\u201cYou okay Jinhee?\u201d Jimin squeezed her hand gently, Jinhee nodding before letting out a yawn. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little tired, is all. I have the night off tonight so hopefully I can sleep tonight.\u201d Jinhee pulled out her ID, since they were stopped in front of her dorm. She squeezed Jimin\u2019s hand back, bidding everyone a goodnight, and additionally, a small apologetic smile to Yoongi, who\u2019s face only flushed at her small gesture. The only person who had caught that besides the two of them was Jimin, and that only made him grin mischievously. Him flirting with Jinhee just got a lot more\u2026 interesting, to say in the least.</p><p><i>2-18-19</i></p></p>",

Something about the way he looked really got you in a trance, the way he looked up from his bangs threatening to spill over his eyes, but also the duality when he wasn&rsquo;t dancing anymore and he gave you the cute little bunny smile that you were used to.</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin! Your dancing was so fluid!&rdquo; Jinhee seemed to have stars in her eyes when she ran up to Jimin, who only smirked back at her, tilting her chin up maintain eye contact with her. </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this Jimin, hm? You should follow y/n&rsquo;s lead and call me oppa.&rdquo; He swiped his thumb across her lips with a wink, making her tense up and shiver. </p><p>&ldquo;W-what are you talking about?? You&rsquo;re barely 5 days older than me shut up!&rdquo; Her face was red as she stomped back to the side, you and Kevin laughing your asses off at how quickly Jinhee had deflected the baffled Jimin. While the two of you were laughing incredibly hard, the door opened once more, and everyone&rsquo;s attention turned to who had just walked in. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with both of the music majors and consistently dyeing their hair?&rdquo; Jimin furrowed his brows, pointing at Yoongi&rsquo;s newly dyed mint hair. Once Jinhee and Yoongi met eyes, they almost seemed to have a comedic Spiderman meme moment, pointing at each other confusedly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called the depression, Jimin, get on board with it.&rdquo; Yoongi pursed his lips, sitting closer to Taehyung and Kevin rather than you and Jinhee. Seokjin made a face at Yoongi, before looking at the other musician before snorting.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh cute, they&rsquo;re grapes&rdquo; Seokjin laughed at his own observation, taking off his shoes before walking across the marley to meet the ones sitting out. Hoseok had called the rest of WINGS onto the dance floor, beginning to work on new choreography with them. You began to get back into the flow of dancing again, the rest of the group falling back into the routine. Hoseok was busy teaching the choreography to everyone, and occasionally while you guys danced, Seokjin and Jinhee hyped you guys along, some <i>AYY GO OFF Y/N!</i> or <i>OKAAAAAAAYYYYY TAEHYUNG HIT IT!</i> coming from the two in the corner. Yoongi looked like he was losing brain cells by being around them, but the smile on his face really said otherwise. </p><p>You felt all the stress from the last week dissipate as you danced more, the emotions rolling off of you as well. By the end of rehearsal, you felt way better than how you felt when you walked in. As everyone was getting ready to leave, you gave everyone hugs, thanking them for the hard work.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to walk back to the dorm together, y/n? It&rsquo;s kinda late and I wanna just run over what we need to know for our stats quiz tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook smiled sheepishly, scratching his head. You nodded, getting your coat on and waving goodbye to everyone else in the dance room. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;re up next, yeah?&rdquo; Hoseok and Seokjin waved to the five left in the room. Seokjin blowing a kiss to Jinhee (who only took it and threw it on the ground, stomping it), and Hoseok just did his signature smile, leaving with his flatmate. Kevin and Taehyung were already talking about their shared Introduction to Neuroscience course, waiting near the door for the other three to be ready so they could do one last check of the room before leaving. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop Jinhee off first, you&rsquo;re along the way, right?&rdquo; Taehyung inquired, Jinhee nodding as she tied her laces so that they could leave. Kevin helped her back up from her squat, a small thank you escaping as they all went to put on their coats. </p><p>The walk home was relatively quiet for everyone, mainly because they were walking faster than normal through the cold of campus to get to the dorms. Taehyung and Kevin were in a heated discussion about one person in their class who they both just wanted to sock in their class, Jimin and Yoongi were talking about his cat, Killmonger, and Jinhee was trailing behind them, spacing out. </p><p>A block away from Jinhee&rsquo;s dorm (across the street from the other four), Jimin had noticed that Jinhee had been a lot more quiet than usual, making him stop and let her catch up to him and Yoongi. He tilted his head sideways, making her conscious of him looking of her. Her face turned red, she looked away before peeking back at Jimin to see if he ever broke eye contact with her. Jimin chuckled a little, sliding his hand into hers, the two of them forgetting Yoongi being there.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay Jinhee?&rdquo; Jimin squeezed her hand gently, Jinhee nodding before letting out a yawn. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a little tired, is all. I have the night off tonight so hopefully I can sleep tonight.&rdquo; Jinhee pulled out her ID, since they were stopped in front of her dorm. She squeezed Jimin&rsquo;s hand back, bidding everyone a goodnight, and additionally, a small apologetic smile to Yoongi, who&rsquo;s face only flushed at her small gesture. The only person who had caught that besides the two of them was Jimin, and that only made him grin mischievously. Him flirting with Jinhee just got a lot more&hellip; interesting, to say in the least.</p><p><i>2-18-19</i></p></p>",

Although, Jin just thought he was <i>that</i> funny. Who wouldn\u2019t laugh at his jokes? There\u2019s no <i>way</i> that your laughter was fueled by something else, right? <i>Right</i>? So, he never paid much attention to it, really, naturally reciprocating your \u201cfriendly\u201d nature, not really seeing your intentions, but happy to hold you and surprise you with hugs- much like you did with him. He was just being <i>friendly </i>and he truly thought you were too. The thought that it was something more didn\u2019t even cross his mind- it wasn\u2019t even a possibility, because to Jin, you were in a whole different universe- you were so far above him, <i>him</i>, that he couldn\u2019t possibly see you caring for him in that way. Jin, \u201cworldwide handsome\u201d, only ever felt uncertainty around you. Unsure of himself and his own worth, because he cared so much for you.\u00a0</p><p>So, it never crossed his mind that you cared for him in that way, not even when he found you crying, crying about some guy who didn\u2019t love you back- not even when you refused to tell him who, said it was someone he knew, but you couldn\u2019t say <i>who</i>- not even then did he consider your actions towards him flirtatious. He only cared about making you feel better, but couldn\u2019t understand when you told him to leave you alone- still not understanding when he saw Taehyung holding you and telling you it was okay- and you <i>let </i>him.\u00a0</p><p>Kim Seokjin still didn\u2019t understand why you\u2019d suddenly pulled away from him, why all his attempts to gain your attention and affection back failed miserably. He didn\u2019t understand when he left for his military service and you barely said a word to him- and he didn\u2019t understand the whole time while he was gone, and when he got back, he didn\u2019t understand why you were still in Taehyung\u2019s arms, why the two of you seemed a little <i>too</i> close, and little <i>too</i> friendly, a little too flustered at each other\u2019s touches. He couldn\u2019t understand why your lingering looks and flushed expression- directed at Taehyung- bothered him so much.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand until one of them briefly joked about how you <i>used</i>\u00a0to have a crush on him- and then everything clicked into place. All the lingering touches and longing looks you\u2019d shared with him- all the laughing and blushing, letting him hold you, falling asleep in his arms while watching a movie- that was all you trying to tell him, trying to <i>show</i>\u00a0him, but he\u2019d never understood until now.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Jin would\u2019ve said something about how he never knew, ask you out and hold you close again, try to get back to how things used ot\u00a0be- how he <i>wanted</i>\u00a0it to be, but you cast your gaze towards Taehyung, a wide expression on your face, and shook your head quickly.</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago, though. I don\u2019t anymore.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jin knew he\u2019d lost you when he watched his friend turn to look at you, his expression cracking into a shy smile as he met your gaze and you looked away, a blush creeping down your neck- and there was nothing he could do to fix it.</p><h2><b><br/></b></h2><h2><b><br/><i>Min Yoongi: (620 Words)</i></b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dearbangtansonyeondan:hFc70wy_A-XQ820WtEZRuQ:Z8jejg2fEYhuA\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1417a17de8c3faeffba2eaba4cf5b57/tumblr_pkt1t8z2Bv1vxche8o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"324\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>You thought you\u2019d made it painfully obvious, even going as far as to tell him how you felt- albeit both of you were always drunk when you did so- so he never really held you accountable for that. Yoongi knew he was close with you and that you meant the world to him, but whether he wanted to pursue you romantically or not he didn\u2019t know. He was so <i>unsure</i>. Unsure of dating you- unsure of how ARMYs would react, unsure of how BigHit and his friends would react- his family, everything about it made him a little anxious, so he pushed away any nagging thoughts whenever you\u2019d sit a little too close to him, whenever you\u2019d share a few too many secret looks.\u00a0</p><p>Yoongi convinced himself that you didn\u2019t want him and he didn\u2019t want you- that he was content with friendship and friendship alone and he stuck to that. For years, the two of you only got closer and closer as the longing built up, everyone around the two of you able to see what was going on, but not saying anything about it.\u00a0</p><p>Yoongi was getting more and more stressed- pushing down his own feelings for you for so long he was now <i>convinced</i>\u00a0that he only had platonic love for you and you felt the same towards him, so he never even entertained the idea of being with you. Only in his dreams, he would see you, hold you, kiss you- you would tell him you loved him and he would do the same, yet every morning he woke up, he didn\u2019t remember what had happened to make a gaping hole in his heart, a dull, heavy aching building in the back of his subconscious.\u00a0</p><p>He simply couldn\u2019t <i>remember</i>.</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember any of his dreams, his mind\u2019s deepest desires showing themselves as he slept, only to safely retreat back into his mind in the morning in fear of rejection.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the multiple drunken nights you\u2019d spent together, talking, laughing and holding each other- he couldn\u2019t remember kissing you in drunken bliss, holding you close to him and drowning himself in you.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember because he didn\u2019t <i>want</i>\u00a0to. Yoongi didn\u2019t want to feel the burning love for someone he could never have, didn\u2019t want to let his guard down and get hurt- he didn\u2019t want to face rejection, so he never even let himself <i>feel</i>. He ignored his feelings, passed them off as platonic and called it a day.</p><p>But when he noticed the looks fading and the space between you two growing- his heart ached dully as his spot was replaced with Jimin.\u00a0</p><p>Jimin, who\u2019d laugh with you, smile with you, hold you, sleep and dream with you if you wanted him to.\u00a0</p><p>Jimin who would feel for you- <i>with</i>\u00a0you- who would fully accept and indulge himself in a relationship, showering you with affection.</p><p>Jimin, who would give you everything Yoongi had forced himself not to- in fear of being rejected by the only person he\u2019d cared for in this way, he pushed you away, forcing you to forget what you also considered a silly fantasy.</p><p>He didn\u2019t <i>let</i>\u00a0himself see what was so obvious until Jimin was with you- until it was already too late and until he had already lost his chance, and in that moment, in avoiding rejection, trying <i>so</i>\u00a0hard to avoid being hurt, he would have been left with his heart broken, and a jealous, burning feeling towards Jimin.</p><p>So, to save his friendship-and his own heart- Yoongi went on pretending as if he\u2019d only seen you as a friend.\u00a0</p><p>As if he hadn\u2019t dreamt of you.</p><p>As if he doesn\u2019t <i>still</i>\u00a0dream of you.</p><p><br/></p><h2><i><b>Jung Hoseok: (432 Words)</b></i></h2><p><i></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"344\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"junghosoks:Y25Bgw512kw9YHo37kMlEQ:ZS9bfe2Un2Zs1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c75f6de36f4e61c310f8b9204ecdd225/tumblr_p3lnz3BQtZ1w5oghbo2_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"344\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Hoseok wanted to be happy for you when you first started dating Namjoon. Two of his best friends dating? He should be <i>happy</i>\u00a0for them, happy that they found each other, happy that <i>you</i>\u00a0were happy- but instead every time he saw the two of you together he\u2019d have to turn away, ignore the strange burning in the back of his throat at the sight of you two together. He\u2019d do his best to stay positive, but he\u2019d also throw himself into dancing more, trying to ignore any feelings of jealousy that rose up purely out of guilt and confusion.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt this way about you before, not that he knew of, at least. He knew he was <i>happy</i>\u00a0around you- truly, beautifully happy, and he didn\u2019t understand why it was <i>Namjoon</i>. You were closer with him- <i>Hoseok, him</i>- then you were Namjoon, so <i>why</i>\u00a0were you with Namjoon now?</p><p>Why, when the two of you had spent <i>hours</i>\u00a0laughing together, days, weeks, and months apart made less miserable through hours of calling, texting, and video calling. Why choose Namjoon?</p><p>Hoseok had been your <i>first</i>- first love, first <i>kiss</i>, but the timing was wrong, it was off, and nothing wanted to work out.</p><p>When everything was said and done- when all the cards were laid out on the table- it didn\u2019t <i>work</i>, there was always some excuse.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWe were drunk,\u201d ,\u00a0\u201cit was a dare,\u201d ,\u00a0\u201cwe were alone on valentine\u2019s day,\u201d- </i>Excuse after excuse after excuse- and it <i>worked</i>. The two never persude anything more than friendship- with an occasional slip up here and there- because <i>he</i>\u00a0thought you didn\u2019t want to, and <i>you</i>\u00a0thought he didn\u2019t want to. Because you\u2019d said to each other, after everything happened, <i>we\u2019re still friends, right?</i><br/></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>Because Hoseok <i>knows</i>\u00a0he loves you, but didn\u2019t want to risk mistake platonic love for something else. He didn\u2019t want to see you hurt and have it be <i>his</i>\u00a0fault- and he wasn\u2019t <i>ready.</i>\u00a0He wasn\u2019t ready for a realtionship yet, wasn\u2019t ready to let himself fall completely for you- unknowing it had already happened- and so he\u2019d said, <i>yes, we\u2019re still friends.</i></p><p>Because you were, and you are, and you always <i>will</i>\u00a0be. Nothing would keep Hoseok away from you, in the end, not Namjoon, not his friends, not his parents, not the army or the entire universe, he would <i>force</i>\u00a0his way into your life if he had to- cling to you and never let go, but, it would never matter, and he could never get hurt, right?</p><p>Because in the end, you\u2019re still friends.</p><p><i>Right</i>?</p><p><br/></p><h2><i><b>Kim Namjoon: (641 Words)</b></i></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"177\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"minyoongihoseok:EXWmSNqRVStTfV4USNGm8g:ZFvQ6e2LNFfPU\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cb19a001f95673bd7b56994de8c8ab5/tumblr_opgqlhKEdZ1wngqeuo3_250.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"177\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Namjoon only ever blamed himself for how things had turned out with you. He had actually been the one to introduce you to his friends and Hoseok had immediately asked if he would to date you, how he felt about you, how he saw you, etc. He should\u2019ve <i>seen</i>\u00a0the way Hoseok looked at you, but everything was happening so fast, he lost time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to be with you anymore, always looking after the band, doing interviews, translating and helping the boys learn more English when he could, all while working on new music and learning choreography for concerts (which they were also in the middle of doing).\u00a0So, admittedly, he had reasons. He had reasons for responding less, not calling you as often, and being more on edge and not as friendly all the time.\u00a0</p><p>But still, <i>still</i>, if he should\u2019ve seen one thing, it should\u2019ve been this.</p><p>He should\u2019ve questioned why you were still over all the time when he didn\u2019t invite you- why your laughter would always be followed by Hoseok\u2019s. He should\u2019ve seen that wherever you went, you were never alone. He should\u2019ve seen Hoseok trailing behind you, tugging at your waist to pull you into a hug- he should\u2019ve seen the two of you tripping and laughing, lightly pushing and teasing each other, the buds of flirting and romance starting to sprout between the two of you, but he couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>Anytime he saw you, you were all he saw. He would be overwhelmed with <i>feelings</i>, and <i>inspiration</i>, and he\u2019d <i>have</i>\u00a0to write about you- put you into the lyrics and give his heart to the entire world, tell everyone how he felt, but in doing that, he saw you less, you two grew more distant, and you felt abandoned and rejected.</p><p>And Hoseok always made you laugh, no matter how sad you were. So, you didn\u2019t mind him trailing behind you all the time, following you like a puppy. You didn\u2019t mind when he\u2019d pull you into a crushing hug, because it made you feel better- it made you forget Namjoon a little more, every passing day.</p><p>And every day, Namjoon was writing about you. Pouring his heart out to you, not ready to show you just yet. There was always <i>one</i>\u00a0line that needed changing, one line that could be made better, one line that could be tweaked just a little, and <i>then</i>\u00a0it would be perfect. He didn\u2019t want to share his feelings until they were perfectly written out, but as he was writing his own feelings out, getting lost in his heart, <i>he</i>\u00a0was getting lost from your heart- slowly drifting further and further away the more he wrote, the more he poured his heart out and prepared, the further gone you already were.</p><p>Maybe if he\u2019d have stopped a week earlier- a few <i>days</i>\u00a0even, and you would\u2019ve been his, you would\u2019ve been in <i>his</i>\u00a0arms, <i>his</i>\u00a0bed, you would\u2019ve been Namjoon and y/n, and he <i>knew</i>\u00a0this.</p><p>He knew because he saw the questioning look on your face when he played the song to you. He saw the small twinge of pain and confusion when you heard it, words vaguely sparking old feelings inside of you, but everything had come to a crashing halt when Hoseok had thrown his arm around you, placing a quick kiss to your cheek before asking,\u00a0<i>\u201cwho did Namjoonie write this for, hmm?\u201d</i></p><p>But you didn\u2019t have the answer- Namjoon had lost his, so there was nothing to say. Only a shrug and a simple;\u00a0<i>\u201cfor armys</i>,\u201d before leaving the two of you, cursing himself for ever introducing you to his friends, disappointed in himself for being mad at Hoseok, angry for waiting so <i>long</i>\u00a0to try and tell you- and heartbroken over losing the love of his life, his inspiration.</p>",

Although, Jin just thought he was <i>that</i> funny. Who wouldn\u2019t laugh at his jokes? There\u2019s no <i>way</i> that your laughter was fueled by something else, right? <i>Right</i>? So, he never paid much attention to it, really, naturally reciprocating your \u201cfriendly\u201d nature, not really seeing your intentions, but happy to hold you and surprise you with hugs- much like you did with him. He was just being <i>friendly </i>and he truly thought you were too. The thought that it was something more didn\u2019t even cross his mind- it wasn\u2019t even a possibility, because to Jin, you were in a whole different universe- you were so far above him, <i>him</i>, that he couldn\u2019t possibly see you caring for him in that way. Jin, \u201cworldwide handsome\u201d, only ever felt uncertainty around you. Unsure of himself and his own worth, because he cared so much for you.\u00a0</p><p>So, it never crossed his mind that you cared for him in that way, not even when he found you crying, crying about some guy who didn\u2019t love you back- not even when you refused to tell him who, said it was someone he knew, but you couldn\u2019t say <i>who</i>- not even then did he consider your actions towards him flirtatious. He only cared about making you feel better, but couldn\u2019t understand when you told him to leave you alone- still not understanding when he saw Taehyung holding you and telling you it was okay- and you <i>let </i>him.\u00a0</p><p>Kim Seokjin still didn\u2019t understand why you\u2019d suddenly pulled away from him, why all his attempts to gain your attention and affection back failed miserably. He didn\u2019t understand when he left for his military service and you barely said a word to him- and he didn\u2019t understand the whole time while he was gone, and when he got back, he didn\u2019t understand why you were still in Taehyung\u2019s arms, why the two of you seemed a little <i>too</i> close, and little <i>too</i> friendly, a little too flustered at each other\u2019s touches.

He had actually been the one to introduce you to his friends and Hoseok had immediately asked if he would to date you, how he felt about you, how he saw you, etc. He should\u2019ve <i>seen</i>\u00a0the way Hoseok looked at you, but everything was happening so fast, he lost time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to be with you anymore, always looking after the band, doing interviews, translating and helping the boys learn more English when he could, all while working on new music and learning choreography for concerts (which they were also in the middle of doing).\u00a0So, admittedly, he had reasons. He had reasons for responding less, not calling you as often, and being more on edge and not as friendly all the time.\u00a0</p><p>But still, <i>still</i>, if he should\u2019ve seen one thing, it should\u2019ve been this.</p><p>He should\u2019ve questioned why you were still over all the time when he didn\u2019t invite you- why your laughter would always be followed by Hoseok\u2019s. He should\u2019ve seen that wherever you went, you were never alone. He should\u2019ve seen Hoseok trailing behind you, tugging at your waist to pull you into a hug- he should\u2019ve seen the two of you tripping and laughing, lightly pushing and teasing each other, the buds of flirting and romance starting to sprout between the two of you, but he couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>Anytime he saw you, you were all he saw. He would be overwhelmed with <i>feelings</i>, and <i>inspiration</i>, and he\u2019d <i>have</i>\u00a0to write about you- put you into the lyrics and give his heart to the entire world, tell everyone how he felt, but in doing that, he saw you less, you two grew more distant, and you felt abandoned and rejected.</p><p>And Hoseok always made you laugh, no matter how sad you were. So, you didn\u2019t mind him trailing behind you all the time, following you like a puppy. You didn\u2019t mind when he\u2019d pull you into a crushing hug, because it made you feel better- it made you forget Namjoon a little more, every passing day.</p><p>And every day, Namjoon was writing about you. Pouring his heart out to you, not ready to show you just yet. There was always <i>one</i>\u00a0line that needed changing, one line that could be made better, one line that could be tweaked just a little, and <i>then</i>\u00a0it would be perfect. He didn\u2019t want to share his feelings until they were perfectly written out, but as he was writing his own feelings out, getting lost in his heart, <i>he</i>\u00a0was getting lost from your heart- slowly drifting further and further away the more he wrote, the more he poured his heart out and prepared, the further gone you already were.</p><p>Maybe if he\u2019d have stopped a week earlier- a few <i>days</i>\u00a0even, and you would\u2019ve been his, you would\u2019ve been in <i>his</i>\u00a0arms, <i>his</i>\u00a0bed, you would\u2019ve been Namjoon and y/n, and he <i>knew</i>\u00a0this.</p><p>He knew because he saw the questioning look on your face when he played the song to you. He saw the small twinge of pain and confusion when you heard it, words vaguely sparking old feelings inside of you, but everything had come to a crashing halt when Hoseok had thrown his arm around you, placing a quick kiss to your cheek before asking,\u00a0<i>\u201cwho did Namjoonie write this for, hmm?\u201d</i></p><p>But you didn\u2019t have the answer- Namjoon had lost his, so there was nothing to say. Only a shrug and a simple;\u00a0<i>\u201cfor armys</i>,\u201d before leaving the two of you, cursing himself for ever introducing you to his friends, disappointed in himself for being mad at Hoseok, angry for waiting so <i>long</i>\u00a0to try and tell you- and heartbroken over losing the love of his life, his inspiration.</p>",

He should\u2019ve seen Hoseok trailing behind you, tugging at your waist to pull you into a hug- he should\u2019ve seen the two of you tripping and laughing, lightly pushing and teasing each other, the buds of flirting and romance starting to sprout between the two of you, but he couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>Anytime he saw you, you were all he saw.

Although, Jin just thought he was <i>that</i> funny. Who wouldn&rsquo;t laugh at his jokes? There&rsquo;s no <i>way</i> that your laughter was fueled by something else, right? <i>Right</i>? So, he never paid much attention to it, really, naturally reciprocating your &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; nature, not really seeing your intentions, but happy to hold you and surprise you with hugs- much like you did with him. He was just being <i>friendly </i>and he truly thought you were too. The thought that it was something more didn&rsquo;t even cross his mind- it wasn&rsquo;t even a possibility, because to Jin, you were in a whole different universe- you were so far above him, <i>him</i>, that he couldn&rsquo;t possibly see you caring for him in that way. Jin, &ldquo;worldwide handsome&rdquo;, only ever felt uncertainty around you. Unsure of himself and his own worth, because he cared so much for you.&nbsp;</p><p>So, it never crossed his mind that you cared for him in that way, not even when he found you crying, crying about some guy who didn&rsquo;t love you back- not even when you refused to tell him who, said it was someone he knew, but you couldn&rsquo;t say <i>who</i>- not even then did he consider your actions towards him flirtatious. He only cared about making you feel better, but couldn&rsquo;t understand when you told him to leave you alone- still not understanding when he saw Taehyung holding you and telling you it was okay- and you <i>let </i>him.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim Seokjin still didn&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;d suddenly pulled away from him, why all his attempts to gain your attention and affection back failed miserably. He didn&rsquo;t understand when he left for his military service and you barely said a word to him- and he didn&rsquo;t understand the whole time while he was gone, and when he got back, he didn&rsquo;t understand why you were still in Taehyung&rsquo;s arms, why the two of you seemed a little <i>too</i> close, and little <i>too</i> friendly, a little too flustered at each other&rsquo;s touches. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why your lingering looks and flushed expression- directed at Taehyung- bothered him so much.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t understand until one of them briefly joked about how you <i>used</i>&nbsp;to have a crush on him- and then everything clicked into place. All the lingering touches and longing looks you&rsquo;d shared with him- all the laughing and blushing, letting him hold you, falling asleep in his arms while watching a movie- that was all you trying to tell him, trying to <i>show</i>&nbsp;him, but he&rsquo;d never understood until now.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Jin would&rsquo;ve said something about how he never knew, ask you out and hold you close again, try to get back to how things used ot&nbsp;be- how he <i>wanted</i>&nbsp;it to be, but you cast your gaze towards Taehyung, a wide expression on your face, and shook your head quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;That was a long time ago, though. I don&rsquo;t anymore.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jin knew he&rsquo;d lost you when he watched his friend turn to look at you, his expression cracking into a shy smile as he met your gaze and you looked away, a blush creeping down your neck- and there was nothing he could do to fix it.</p><h2><b><br /></b></h2><h2><b><br /><i>Min Yoongi: (620 Words)</i></b></h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p>You thought you&rsquo;d made it painfully obvious, even going as far as to tell him how you felt- albeit both of you were always drunk when you did so- so he never really held you accountable for that. Yoongi knew he was close with you and that you meant the world to him, but whether he wanted to pursue you romantically or not he didn&rsquo;t know. He was so <i>unsure</i>. Unsure of dating you- unsure of how ARMYs would react, unsure of how BigHit and his friends would react- his family, everything about it made him a little anxious, so he pushed away any nagging thoughts whenever you&rsquo;d sit a little too close to him, whenever you&rsquo;d share a few too many secret looks.&nbsp;</p><p>Yoongi convinced himself that you didn&rsquo;t want him and he didn&rsquo;t want you- that he was content with friendship and friendship alone and he stuck to that. For years, the two of you only got closer and closer as the longing built up, everyone around the two of you able to see what was going on, but not saying anything about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Yoongi was getting more and more stressed- pushing down his own feelings for you for so long he was now <i>convinced</i>&nbsp;that he only had platonic love for you and you felt the same towards him, so he never even entertained the idea of being with you. Only in his dreams, he would see you, hold you, kiss you- you would tell him you loved him and he would do the same, yet every morning he woke up, he didn&rsquo;t remember what had happened to make a gaping hole in his heart, a dull, heavy aching building in the back of his subconscious.&nbsp;</p><p>He simply couldn&rsquo;t <i>remember</i>.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t remember any of his dreams, his mind&rsquo;s deepest desires showing themselves as he slept, only to safely retreat back into his mind in the morning in fear of rejection.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t remember the multiple drunken nights you&rsquo;d spent together, talking, laughing and holding each other- he couldn&rsquo;t remember kissing you in drunken bliss, holding you close to him and drowning himself in you.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t remember because he didn&rsquo;t <i>want</i>&nbsp;to. Yoongi didn&rsquo;t want to feel the burning love for someone he could never have, didn&rsquo;t want to let his guard down and get hurt- he didn&rsquo;t want to face rejection, so he never even let himself <i>feel</i>. He ignored his feelings, passed them off as platonic and called it a day.</p><p>But when he noticed the looks fading and the space between you two growing- his heart ached dully as his spot was replaced with Jimin.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimin, who&rsquo;d laugh with you, smile with you, hold you, sleep and dream with you if you wanted him to.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimin who would feel for you- <i>with</i>&nbsp;you- who would fully accept and indulge himself in a relationship, showering you with affection.</p><p>Jimin, who would give you everything Yoongi had forced himself not to- in fear of being rejected by the only person he&rsquo;d cared for in this way, he pushed you away, forcing you to forget what you also considered a silly fantasy.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t <i>let</i>&nbsp;himself see what was so obvious until Jimin was with you- until it was already too late and until he had already lost his chance, and in that moment, in avoiding rejection, trying <i>so</i>&nbsp;hard to avoid being hurt, he would have been left with his heart broken, and a jealous, burning feeling towards Jimin.</p><p>So, to save his friendship-and his own heart- Yoongi went on pretending as if he&rsquo;d only seen you as a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>As if he hadn&rsquo;t dreamt of you.</p><p>As if he doesn&rsquo;t <i>still</i>&nbsp;dream of you.</p><p><br /></p><h2><i><b>Jung Hoseok: (432 Words)</b></i></h2><p><i></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p>Hoseok wanted to be happy for you when you first started dating Namjoon.
