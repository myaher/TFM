                "content": "<p><b><i>This fucked me! I really hope I did justice to this concept </i></b></p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t the usual scenario, but there he was, laying on the bed; hands above his head tied with a little scarf to the headboard; the&nbsp;whole body glistening with sweat; purple bruises and teeth marks painting his jawlines, neck and his tight nipples.</p><p>He was panting and whimpering as Y/N rode him; one hand pinching his nipple <i>hard</i>. It wasn&rsquo;t a sight Y/N usually saw, but it was a&nbsp;sight she was enjoying very fucking much.</p><p>&ldquo;You like that baby boy?&rdquo; Y/N asked while popping up and down his dick.</p><p>&ldquo;Ye-yes, oh yes,&rdquo; he cried out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please, please let me cum.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N bought him in such a state that he completely submitted himself to her. At first, he&rsquo;d try to threat&nbsp;her, telling her he&rsquo;d punish her later. But now, he couldn&rsquo;t think of anything other than begging for Y/N&rsquo;s mercy.</p><p>It was the third time that she had bought him to his high, and&nbsp;stopped just the second before he came,&nbsp;bringing him to tears. Y/N herself had already cummed twice. First, by her own fingers, as she fingered herself - legs wide in front of his face as he just watched her helplessly. Second, while riding his cock. But, to punish him, she made him wear a cock ring so he won&rsquo;t cum. And the other two times, she gave him the most teasing and the best handjob and blowjob that she could and then stopped, leaving him all breathless and teary. And Harry just wanted to cum, leaving no other choice other than begging.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, please, I&rsquo;ll be a good boy for you, just please,&rdquo; he sobbed.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we decide on five?
