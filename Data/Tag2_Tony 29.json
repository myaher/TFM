But when new evidence comes to light proving foul play, no one in the NYPD will give Peter the time of day.</p><p>No one that is, except genius consulting detective on probation, Tony Stark. But Tony has his own demons to fight. Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br/></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p><p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. \u201cTony Stark.\u201d he drawls, \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see you again.\u201d </p><p>Tony quirks his brows. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d come to this side of the world either.\u201d </p><p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair\u2019s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD\u2019s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p><p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p><p>Fury\u2019s tone says relax, but Tony\u2019s in the lion\u2019s den and he isn\u2019t one to forget it. \u201cYou staying here for the next while?\u201d Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p><p>\u201cPermanently.\u201d Tony says immediately. </p><p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury\u2019s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they\u2019re back on his face just as quickly. \u201cOkay. Anything I need to know about?\u201d he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn\u2019t take the bait. </p><p>His jaw tightens. \u201cNothing you haven\u2019t already snooped out.\u201d Tony\u2019s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. \u201cAre we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what\u2019s actually important?\u201d </p><p>Fury almost looks amused. \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d </p><p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. \u201cThe case.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>\u201cPeter! Have you seen my keys? They\u2019re not on the thing!\u201d </p><p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. \u201cI think\u2026maybe\u2026wait didn\u2019t you put them in your jacket yesterday?\u201d</p><p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, \u201cPeter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.\u201d he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p><p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cWay to kick a girl when she\u2019s down Pete.\u201d </p><p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, \u201cAha!\u201d before rushing back to him.</p><p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. \u201cMay?\u201d his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p><p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she\u2019s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asks again, gentler this time.</p><p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she\u2019s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. \u201cNothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?\u201d </p><p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, \u201cYeah. I love you too May.\u201d </p><p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. \u201cAre you coming back at seven today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier probably.\u201d There\u2019s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can\u2019t put his finger on it. </p><p>\u201cOk great! I\u2019ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.\u201d</p><p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while\u2026she\u2019d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just\u2026keeping. He\u2019d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p><p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they\u2019re the least likely to punch you in the face.\u201d Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he\u2019s doing. Police detectives didn\u2019t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that\u2019s the way the world works isn\u2019t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. \u201cYou must be Stark.\u201d he holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I get that a lot.\u201d Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. \u201cIs this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?\u201d </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. \u201cI like this one.\u201d he glances down, something teasing in his eye, \u201cBit smaller than I thought you\u2019d be. Didn\u2019t you take down a mob in London?\u201d </p><p>Tony makes a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more giant than I thought you\u2019d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?\u201d </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. \u201cIf we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, \u201cSend me the location. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds best.\u201d Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he\u2019d say he didn\u2019t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d he replies, in false cheer, \u201cIt means so much to me that you approve.\u201d </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn\u2019t here to make friends. He doesn\u2019t even need them. Never has. He\u2019s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn\u2019t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony\u2019s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. \u201cFirst respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.\u201d Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut no Ms. Delaney.\u201d </p><p>Tony pauses. \u201cRansom demand?\u201d</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he\u2019s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he\u2019s proven right when moments later he asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. \u201cNot sure.\u201d he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.\u201d Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. \u201cWanna bet captain?\u201d </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, \u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.\u201d </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. \u201cDid you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?\u201d</p><p>A detective Tony hasn\u2019t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany\u2019s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. \u201cAlright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.\u201d Tony clicks the phone shut. \u201cMore likely.\u201d</p><p>Fury squints. \u201cShe looks the exact same in both photos Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. \u201cExactly.\u201d he gestures to the wall. \u201cLook at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.\u201d Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t start believing in coincidences since I\u2019ve been gone have you Captain?\u201d</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>\u201cAlright look.\u201d Tony pulls out her cellphone again, \u201cShe has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.\u201d he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn\u2019t need Fury\u2019s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There\u2019s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn\u2019t belong, but Tony ignores him, \u201cFury! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he\u2019d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He\u2019d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. \u201cGet ready to be blown away kids.\u201d with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. \u201cMs. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.\u201d </p><p>Rogers scoffs, \u201cCaptain are we seriously going to waste our time-\u201d</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn\u2019t said anything at all. \u201cThere are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could\u2019ve deduced that yourself, but,\u201d Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, \u201cobviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.\u201d </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, \u201cRight, yeah, that makes sense. That\u2019s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. \u201cTwo bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.\u201d </p><p>Odinson grins a little. \u201cAlright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. \u201cIf you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it\u2019ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney\u2019s blood. And?\u201d he holds out his arms, \u201cHow could that blood have gotten there?\u201d </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThe blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.\u201d </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, \u201cDon\u2019t worry big guy, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s halfway to the living room before he calls out, \u201cOh. And he took something too. Where\u2019s Mr. Delaney?\u201d </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. \u201cOver there, on that table. Something\u2019s missing. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly know if something was missing?\u201d Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. \u201cIf you could pay attention, you\u2019d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something\u2019s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.\u201d impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, yes. There was\u2026That was where Annabelle kept her mother\u2019s music box.\u201d </p><p>Just like that, Tony\u2019s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. \u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a kidnapping case anymore.\u201d Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark, you\u2019ve been right so far. But there\u2019s no body.\u201d Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can\u2019t stop looking at the lamp and there\u2019s the scent of blood in the room. He can\u2019t see any. But he knows it\u2019s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won\u2019t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>\u201cCaptain-\u201d Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s in the safe room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat safe room?\u201d Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. \u201cThe one behind that wall.\u201d he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. \u201cHer husband didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t know. But look,\u201d he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, \u201call that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.\u201d He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney\u2019s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually hope I\u2019m wrong\u2026but this time, I really wish I was.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p> \u201cAlright so a little bit of salt\u2026\u201d Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>\u201cOk Google, set timer for eight minutes.\u201d His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He\u2019s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. \u201cHey May, what\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. \u201cIs this Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. \u201cMarisa?\u201d </p><p>Marisa\u2019s one of May\u2019s nurse friends. She\u2019d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she\u2019s calling. \u201cPeter, you need to come to the hospital. It\u2019s May.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s entire world dissolves.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in a car accident. And it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. Please- just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best Peter.\u201d Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won\u2019t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He\u2019s the one left behind. \u00a0</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He\u2019s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala\u2019s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery, you know where to go.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he\u2019s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can\u2019t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter\u2019s head falls into his hands.</p><p>\u201cMay Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon\u2019s direction. \u201cYes. Me. That\u2019s me. I\u2019m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?\u201d the surgeon looks like he\u2019s about to frown, give his typical I\u2019m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, \u201cNo-please. Please don\u2019t tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think we should sit down.\u201d </p><p>Peter can\u2019t feel his legs. He can\u2019t feel his own heartbeat. He\u2019s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just\u2026falls. \u201cPeter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.\u201d</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn\u2019t- that wasn\u2019t <i>her</i>. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn\u2019t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn\u2019t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. \u201cPeter\u2026were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.\u201d </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. \u201cOf course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don\u2019t know her. She wasn\u2019t depressed and she wasn\u2019t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling now and he\u2019s making a scene but he can\u2019t help it because this isn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.\u201d the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter I\u2019m not sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala <i>please</i>.\u201d </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. \u201cShe should be attending the fourth floor today.\u201d</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa\u2019s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. \u201cOh Peter.\u201d her voice wobbles and suddenly he\u2019s in her arms. \u201cI wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.\u201d </p><p>He pulls away quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d he says, cavalier, \u201cDid you hear what they\u2019re saying about her? About May?\u201d </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. \u201cPeter honey what are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she taking anti-depressants?\u201d Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know Peter. I don\u2019t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May\u2019s been-\u201d pain paints a shadow across her face, \u201cMay had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn\u2019t be the most surprising thing.\u201d</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn\u2019t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn\u2019t she have said anything? Why wouldn\u2019t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must\u2019ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she\u2019s patting his head. \u201cOh Peter. She probably just didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d </p><p>But that\u2019s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t right!\u201d and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can\u2019t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May\u2019s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May\u2019s crash wasn\u2019t an accident, then that meant it was a\u2026Peter shakes. He doesn\u2019t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn\u2019t be possible\u2026</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It\u2019s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It\u2019s May\u2019s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn\u2019t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May\u2019s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn\u2019t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart\u2019s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May\u2019s notes, where she\u2019s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia\u2026and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you it wasn\u2019t an accident!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can\u2019t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. \u201cSon. I know it\u2019s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou evidently didn\u2019t- if you had, you would have seen this!\u201d Peter waves the file in Rogers\u2019 face but the man doesn\u2019t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain\u2019s office open and close shut and hopes he isn\u2019t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!\u201d </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he\u2019s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. \u201cYour aunt. How did she die?\u201d the man says and Peter\u2019s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn\u2019t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>\u201cA car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think someone tampered with the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-\u201d he frowns.</p><p>\u201cBupropion.\u201d The man supplies.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-\u201d Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. \u201cThe man, Miller, he was murdered.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stands up, \u201cStark you really think it\u2019s a good idea to say that to him right now?\u201d </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, \u201cSay what? The truth?\u201d he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, \u201cI\u2019ll take your case. I\u2019m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.\u201d</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. \u201cWait. Are you a detective here?\u201d</p><p>The man curls his nose. \u201cGod no. I\u2019m a consultant.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression scrunches. \u201cSo like\u2026you consult on crime?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cI\u2019m what they call the department\u2019s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.\u201d he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I\u2019m Tony Stark. And I\u2019m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.\u201d</p>",

He has all the time in the world. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they\u2019re the least likely to punch you in the face.\u201d Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he\u2019s doing. Police detectives didn\u2019t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that\u2019s the way the world works isn\u2019t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. \u201cYou must be Stark.\u201d he holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I get that a lot.\u201d Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. \u201cIs this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?\u201d </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. \u201cI like this one.\u201d he glances down, something teasing in his eye, \u201cBit smaller than I thought you\u2019d be. Didn\u2019t you take down a mob in London?\u201d </p><p>Tony makes a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more giant than I thought you\u2019d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?\u201d </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. \u201cIf we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, \u201cSend me the location. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds best.\u201d Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he\u2019d say he didn\u2019t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d he replies, in false cheer, \u201cIt means so much to me that you approve.\u201d </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn\u2019t here to make friends. He doesn\u2019t even need them. Never has. He\u2019s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn\u2019t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony\u2019s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. \u201cFirst respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.\u201d Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut no Ms. Delaney.\u201d </p><p>Tony pauses. \u201cRansom demand?\u201d</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he\u2019s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he\u2019s proven right when moments later he asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. \u201cNot sure.\u201d he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.\u201d Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. \u201cWanna bet captain?\u201d </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, \u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.\u201d </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. \u201cDid you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?\u201d</p><p>A detective Tony hasn\u2019t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany\u2019s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. \u201cAlright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.\u201d Tony clicks the phone shut. \u201cMore likely.\u201d</p><p>Fury squints. \u201cShe looks the exact same in both photos Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. \u201cExactly.\u201d he gestures to the wall. \u201cLook at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.\u201d Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t start believing in coincidences since I\u2019ve been gone have you Captain?\u201d</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>\u201cAlright look.\u201d Tony pulls out her cellphone again, \u201cShe has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.\u201d he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn\u2019t need Fury\u2019s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There\u2019s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn\u2019t belong, but Tony ignores him, \u201cFury! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he\u2019d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He\u2019d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. \u201cGet ready to be blown away kids.\u201d with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. \u201cMs. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.\u201d </p><p>Rogers scoffs, \u201cCaptain are we seriously going to waste our time-\u201d</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn\u2019t said anything at all. \u201cThere are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could\u2019ve deduced that yourself, but,\u201d Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, \u201cobviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.\u201d </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, \u201cRight, yeah, that makes sense. That\u2019s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. \u201cTwo bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.\u201d </p><p>Odinson grins a little. \u201cAlright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. \u201cIf you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it\u2019ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney\u2019s blood. And?\u201d he holds out his arms, \u201cHow could that blood have gotten there?\u201d </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThe blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.\u201d </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, \u201cDon\u2019t worry big guy, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s halfway to the living room before he calls out, \u201cOh. And he took something too. Where\u2019s Mr. Delaney?\u201d </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. \u201cOver there, on that table. Something\u2019s missing. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly know if something was missing?\u201d Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. \u201cIf you could pay attention, you\u2019d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something\u2019s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.\u201d impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, yes. There was\u2026That was where Annabelle kept her mother\u2019s music box.\u201d </p><p>Just like that, Tony\u2019s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. \u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a kidnapping case anymore.\u201d Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark, you\u2019ve been right so far. But there\u2019s no body.\u201d Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can\u2019t stop looking at the lamp and there\u2019s the scent of blood in the room. He can\u2019t see any. But he knows it\u2019s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won\u2019t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>\u201cCaptain-\u201d Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s in the safe room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat safe room?\u201d Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. \u201cThe one behind that wall.\u201d he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. \u201cHer husband didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t know. But look,\u201d he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, \u201call that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.\u201d He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney\u2019s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually hope I\u2019m wrong\u2026but this time, I really wish I was.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p> \u201cAlright so a little bit of salt\u2026\u201d Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>\u201cOk Google, set timer for eight minutes.\u201d His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He\u2019s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. \u201cHey May, what\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. \u201cIs this Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. \u201cMarisa?\u201d </p><p>Marisa\u2019s one of May\u2019s nurse friends. She\u2019d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she\u2019s calling. \u201cPeter, you need to come to the hospital. It\u2019s May.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s entire world dissolves.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in a car accident. And it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. Please- just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best Peter.\u201d Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won\u2019t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He\u2019s the one left behind. \u00a0</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He\u2019s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala\u2019s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery, you know where to go.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he\u2019s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can\u2019t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter\u2019s head falls into his hands.</p><p>\u201cMay Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon\u2019s direction. \u201cYes. Me. That\u2019s me. I\u2019m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?\u201d the surgeon looks like he\u2019s about to frown, give his typical I\u2019m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, \u201cNo-please. Please don\u2019t tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think we should sit down.\u201d </p><p>Peter can\u2019t feel his legs. He can\u2019t feel his own heartbeat. He\u2019s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just\u2026falls. \u201cPeter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.\u201d</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn\u2019t- that wasn\u2019t <i>her</i>. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn\u2019t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn\u2019t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. \u201cPeter\u2026were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.\u201d </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. \u201cOf course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don\u2019t know her. She wasn\u2019t depressed and she wasn\u2019t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling now and he\u2019s making a scene but he can\u2019t help it because this isn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.\u201d the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter I\u2019m not sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala <i>please</i>.\u201d </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. \u201cShe should be attending the fourth floor today.\u201d</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa\u2019s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. \u201cOh Peter.\u201d her voice wobbles and suddenly he\u2019s in her arms. \u201cI wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.\u201d </p><p>He pulls away quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d he says, cavalier, \u201cDid you hear what they\u2019re saying about her? About May?\u201d </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. \u201cPeter honey what are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she taking anti-depressants?\u201d Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know Peter. I don\u2019t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May\u2019s been-\u201d pain paints a shadow across her face, \u201cMay had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn\u2019t be the most surprising thing.\u201d</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn\u2019t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn\u2019t she have said anything? Why wouldn\u2019t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must\u2019ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she\u2019s patting his head. \u201cOh Peter. She probably just didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d </p><p>But that\u2019s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t right!\u201d and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can\u2019t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May\u2019s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May\u2019s crash wasn\u2019t an accident, then that meant it was a\u2026Peter shakes. He doesn\u2019t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn\u2019t be possible\u2026</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It\u2019s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It\u2019s May\u2019s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn\u2019t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May\u2019s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn\u2019t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart\u2019s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May\u2019s notes, where she\u2019s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia\u2026and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you it wasn\u2019t an accident!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can\u2019t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. \u201cSon. I know it\u2019s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou evidently didn\u2019t- if you had, you would have seen this!\u201d Peter waves the file in Rogers\u2019 face but the man doesn\u2019t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain\u2019s office open and close shut and hopes he isn\u2019t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!\u201d </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he\u2019s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. \u201cYour aunt. How did she die?\u201d the man says and Peter\u2019s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn\u2019t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>\u201cA car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think someone tampered with the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-\u201d he frowns.</p><p>\u201cBupropion.\u201d The man supplies.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-\u201d Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. \u201cThe man, Miller, he was murdered.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stands up, \u201cStark you really think it\u2019s a good idea to say that to him right now?\u201d </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, \u201cSay what? The truth?\u201d he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, \u201cI\u2019ll take your case. I\u2019m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.\u201d</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. \u201cWait. Are you a detective here?\u201d</p><p>The man curls his nose. \u201cGod no. I\u2019m a consultant.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression scrunches. \u201cSo like\u2026you consult on crime?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cI\u2019m what they call the department\u2019s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.\u201d he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I\u2019m Tony Stark. And I\u2019m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.\u201d</p></p>",

But when new evidence comes to light proving foul play, no one in the NYPD will give Peter the time of day.</p><p>No one that is, except genius consulting detective on probation, Tony Stark. But Tony has his own demons to fight. Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p><p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. \u201cTony Stark.\u201d he drawls, \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see you again.\u201d </p><p>Tony quirks his brows. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d come to this side of the world either.\u201d </p><p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair\u2019s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD\u2019s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p><p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p><p>Fury\u2019s tone says relax, but Tony\u2019s in the lion\u2019s den and he isn\u2019t one to forget it. \u201cYou staying here for the next while?\u201d Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p><p>\u201cPermanently.\u201d Tony says immediately. </p><p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury\u2019s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they\u2019re back on his face just as quickly. \u201cOkay. Anything I need to know about?\u201d he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn\u2019t take the bait. </p><p>His jaw tightens. \u201cNothing you haven\u2019t already snooped out.\u201d Tony\u2019s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. \u201cAre we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what\u2019s actually important?\u201d </p><p>Fury almost looks amused. \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d </p><p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. \u201cThe case.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cPeter! Have you seen my keys? They\u2019re not on the thing!\u201d </p><p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. \u201cI think\u2026maybe\u2026wait didn\u2019t you put them in your jacket yesterday?\u201d</p><p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, \u201cPeter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.\u201d he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p><p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cWay to kick a girl when she\u2019s down Pete.\u201d </p><p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, \u201cAha!\u201d before rushing back to him.</p><p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. \u201cMay?\u201d his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p><p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she\u2019s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d he asks again, gentler this time.</p><p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she\u2019s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. \u201cNothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?\u201d </p><p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, \u201cYeah. I love you too May.\u201d </p><p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. \u201cAre you coming back at seven today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarlier probably.\u201d There\u2019s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can\u2019t put his finger on it. </p><p>\u201cOk great! I\u2019ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.\u201d</p><p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while\u2026she\u2019d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just\u2026keeping. He\u2019d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p><p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they\u2019re the least likely to punch you in the face.\u201d Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he\u2019s doing. Police detectives didn\u2019t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that\u2019s the way the world works isn\u2019t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. \u201cYou must be Stark.\u201d he holds out his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I get that a lot.\u201d Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. \u201cIs this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?\u201d </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. \u201cI like this one.\u201d he glances down, something teasing in his eye, \u201cBit smaller than I thought you\u2019d be. Didn\u2019t you take down a mob in London?\u201d </p><p>Tony makes a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more giant than I thought you\u2019d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?\u201d </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. \u201cIf we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, \u201cSend me the location. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds best.\u201d Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he\u2019d say he didn\u2019t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d he replies, in false cheer, \u201cIt means so much to me that you approve.\u201d </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn\u2019t here to make friends. He doesn\u2019t even need them. Never has. He\u2019s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn\u2019t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony\u2019s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. \u201cFirst respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.\u201d Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut no Ms. Delaney.\u201d </p><p>Tony pauses. \u201cRansom demand?\u201d</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he\u2019s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he\u2019s proven right when moments later he asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. \u201cNot sure.\u201d he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s a first.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.\u201d Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. \u201cWanna bet captain?\u201d </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, \u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.\u201d </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. \u201cDid you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?\u201d</p><p>A detective Tony hasn\u2019t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany\u2019s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. \u201cAlright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.\u201d Tony clicks the phone shut. \u201cMore likely.\u201d</p><p>Fury squints. \u201cShe looks the exact same in both photos Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. \u201cExactly.\u201d he gestures to the wall. \u201cLook at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.\u201d Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, \u201cYou didn\u2019t start believing in coincidences since I\u2019ve been gone have you Captain?\u201d</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>\u201cAlright look.\u201d Tony pulls out her cellphone again, \u201cShe has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.\u201d he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn\u2019t need Fury\u2019s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There\u2019s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn\u2019t belong, but Tony ignores him, \u201cFury! Get in here!\u201d</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he\u2019d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He\u2019d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. \u201cGet ready to be blown away kids.\u201d with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. \u201cMs. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.\u201d </p><p>Rogers scoffs, \u201cCaptain are we seriously going to waste our time-\u201d</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn\u2019t said anything at all. \u201cThere are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could\u2019ve deduced that yourself, but,\u201d Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, \u201cobviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.\u201d </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, \u201cRight, yeah, that makes sense. That\u2019s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. \u201cTwo bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.\u201d </p><p>Odinson grins a little. \u201cAlright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. \u201cIf you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it\u2019ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney\u2019s blood. And?\u201d he holds out his arms, \u201cHow could that blood have gotten there?\u201d </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThe blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.\u201d </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, \u201cDon\u2019t worry big guy, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s halfway to the living room before he calls out, \u201cOh. And he took something too. Where\u2019s Mr. Delaney?\u201d </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. \u201cOver there, on that table. Something\u2019s missing. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly know if something was missing?\u201d Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. \u201cIf you could pay attention, you\u2019d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something\u2019s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.\u201d impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I, yes. There was\u2026That was where Annabelle kept her mother\u2019s music box.\u201d </p><p>Just like that, Tony\u2019s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. \u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a kidnapping case anymore.\u201d Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. \u201cIt\u2019s a murder.\u201d </p><p>\u201cStark, you\u2019ve been right so far. But there\u2019s no body.\u201d Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can\u2019t stop looking at the lamp and there\u2019s the scent of blood in the room. He can\u2019t see any. But he knows it\u2019s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won\u2019t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>\u201cCaptain-\u201d Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s in the safe room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat safe room?\u201d Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. \u201cThe one behind that wall.\u201d he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. \u201cHer husband didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugs. \u201cHe probably didn\u2019t know. But look,\u201d he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, \u201call that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.\u201d He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney\u2019s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually hope I\u2019m wrong\u2026but this time, I really wish I was.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p> \u201cAlright so a little bit of salt\u2026\u201d Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>\u201cOk Google, set timer for eight minutes.\u201d His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He\u2019s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. \u201cHey May, what\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. \u201cIs this Peter?\u201d</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. \u201cMarisa?\u201d </p><p>Marisa\u2019s one of May\u2019s nurse friends. She\u2019d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she\u2019s calling. \u201cPeter, you need to come to the hospital. It\u2019s May.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s entire world dissolves.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in a car accident. And it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. Please- just- just-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best Peter.\u201d Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won\u2019t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He\u2019s the one left behind. \u00a0</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He\u2019s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala\u2019s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s in surgery, you know where to go.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he\u2019s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can\u2019t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter\u2019s head falls into his hands.</p><p>\u201cMay Parker?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon\u2019s direction. \u201cYes. Me. That\u2019s me. I\u2019m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?\u201d the surgeon looks like he\u2019s about to frown, give his typical I\u2019m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, \u201cNo-please. Please don\u2019t tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think we should sit down.\u201d </p><p>Peter can\u2019t feel his legs. He can\u2019t feel his own heartbeat. He\u2019s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just\u2026falls. \u201cPeter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.\u201d</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn\u2019t- that wasn\u2019t <i>her</i>. </p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn\u2019t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn\u2019t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. \u201cPeter\u2026were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.\u201d </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. \u201cOf course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don\u2019t know her. She wasn\u2019t depressed and she wasn\u2019t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling now and he\u2019s making a scene but he can\u2019t help it because this isn\u2019t right, it isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.\u201d the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter I\u2019m not sure-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Hala <i>please</i>.\u201d </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. \u201cShe should be attending the fourth floor today.\u201d</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa\u2019s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. \u201cOh Peter.\u201d her voice wobbles and suddenly he\u2019s in her arms. \u201cI wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.\u201d </p><p>He pulls away quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d he says, cavalier, \u201cDid you hear what they\u2019re saying about her? About May?\u201d </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. \u201cPeter honey what are you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she taking anti-depressants?\u201d Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know Peter. I don\u2019t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May\u2019s been-\u201d pain paints a shadow across her face, \u201cMay had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn\u2019t be the most surprising thing.\u201d</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn\u2019t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn\u2019t she have said anything? Why wouldn\u2019t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must\u2019ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she\u2019s patting his head. \u201cOh Peter. She probably just didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d </p><p>But that\u2019s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t right. It isn\u2019t right!\u201d and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can\u2019t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May\u2019s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May\u2019s crash wasn\u2019t an accident, then that meant it was a\u2026Peter shakes. He doesn\u2019t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn\u2019t be possible\u2026</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It\u2019s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It\u2019s May\u2019s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn\u2019t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May\u2019s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn\u2019t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart\u2019s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May\u2019s notes, where she\u2019s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia\u2026and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2013o00o\u2013</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you it wasn\u2019t an accident!\u201d Peter\u2019s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can\u2019t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. \u201cSon. I know it\u2019s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou evidently didn\u2019t- if you had, you would have seen this!\u201d Peter waves the file in Rogers\u2019 face but the man doesn\u2019t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain\u2019s office open and close shut and hopes he isn\u2019t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. \u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!\u201d </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he\u2019s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. \u201cYour aunt. How did she die?\u201d the man says and Peter\u2019s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn\u2019t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>\u201cA car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think someone tampered with the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-\u201d he frowns.</p><p>\u201cBupropion.\u201d The man supplies.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-\u201d Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. \u201cThe man, Miller, he was murdered.\u201d </p><p>Rogers stands up, \u201cStark you really think it\u2019s a good idea to say that to him right now?\u201d </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, \u201cSay what? The truth?\u201d he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, \u201cI\u2019ll take your case. I\u2019m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no sir.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGreat. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.\u201d</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. \u201cWait. Are you a detective here?\u201d</p><p>The man curls his nose. \u201cGod no. I\u2019m a consultant.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression scrunches. \u201cSo like\u2026you consult on crime?\u201d</p><p>The man sighs. \u201cI\u2019m what they call the department\u2019s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.\u201d he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I\u2019m Tony Stark. And I\u2019m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.\u201d</p></p>",

But Tony has his own demons to fight. Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br /></p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p><p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. &ldquo;Tony Stark.&rdquo; he drawls, &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d see you again.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony quirks his brows. &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d come to this side of the world either.&rdquo; </p><p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair&rsquo;s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD&rsquo;s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p><p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p><p>Fury&rsquo;s tone says relax, but Tony&rsquo;s in the lion&rsquo;s den and he isn&rsquo;t one to forget it. &ldquo;You staying here for the next while?&rdquo; Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p><p>&ldquo;Permanently.&rdquo; Tony says immediately. </p><p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury&rsquo;s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they&rsquo;re back on his face just as quickly. &ldquo;Okay. Anything I need to know about?&rdquo; he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn&rsquo;t take the bait. </p><p>His jaw tightens. &ldquo;Nothing you haven&rsquo;t already snooped out.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. &ldquo;Are we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what&rsquo;s actually important?&rdquo; </p><p>Fury almost looks amused. &ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. &ldquo;The case.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter! Have you seen my keys? They&rsquo;re not on the thing!&rdquo; </p><p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. &ldquo;I think&hellip;maybe&hellip;wait didn&rsquo;t you put them in your jacket yesterday?&rdquo;</p><p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, &ldquo;Peter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.&rdquo; he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p><p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can&rsquo;t help but laugh, &ldquo;Way to kick a girl when she&rsquo;s down Pete.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; before rushing back to him.</p><p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. &ldquo;May?&rdquo; his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p><p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she&rsquo;s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; he asks again, gentler this time.</p><p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she&rsquo;s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. &ldquo;Nothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, &ldquo;Yeah. I love you too May.&rdquo; </p><p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. &ldquo;Are you coming back at seven today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Earlier probably.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can&rsquo;t put his finger on it. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok great! I&rsquo;ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.&rdquo;</p><p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while&hellip;she&rsquo;d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just&hellip;keeping. He&rsquo;d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p><p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be working with Detectives Rogers and Odinson. I figure out of everyone here, they&rsquo;re the least likely to punch you in the face.&rdquo; Fury says with a wry note.</p><p>Tony looks unaffected, used to that kind of reaction ever since he started doing what he&rsquo;s doing. Police detectives didn&rsquo;t tend to take kindly to snarky consultants with three times their IQ. But that&rsquo;s the way the world works isn&rsquo;t it? </p><p>Rogers is tall, stern, the perfect all-American boy. Odinson, in contrast, is broad, buoyant, and smiles so wide Tony thinks he has a condition. He can already picture it now. Rogers, the no-nonsense, by the book cop who gets worn down by the puppy-like excitement of his partner who teaches him to soften up. Resisting the urge to grimace, Tony tries to present a somewhat neutral image of himself when Rogers glances up at him, eyes judgy and ascertaining. &ldquo;You must be Stark.&rdquo; he holds out his hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I get that a lot.&rdquo; Tony replies, grasping his hand and hiding his wince when Rogers squeezes hard. </p><p>Odinson surges forward, a hard look in his eyes and Tony gets a flash of a storm. The man looms over him, close enough that Tony can see the tiny scars on his collar. Odinson stares at him. Tony stares right back. &ldquo;Is this the part where you ask me out or am I just that out of your league?&rdquo; </p><p>Odinson blinks before he booms in laughter. Clapping Tony on the chest, the detective looks oddly pleased. &ldquo;I like this one.&rdquo; he glances down, something teasing in his eye, &ldquo;Bit smaller than I thought you&rsquo;d be. Didn&rsquo;t you take down a mob in London?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony makes a face. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a lot more giant than I thought you&rsquo;d be. NYPD hiring Harry Potter characters?&rdquo; </p><p>Fury makes a rumbling sound in his throat. &ldquo;If we could all get off the testosterone train for a second, we have a crime to get to.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods, at full attention, &ldquo;Send me the location. I&rsquo;ll meet you there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sounds best.&rdquo; Rogers nods and if Tony cared more about what people thought about him, he&rsquo;d say he didn&rsquo;t like that hard stance, arms crossed and eyes narrowed like Tony was a criminal who ran out on bail.</p><p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo; he replies, in false cheer, &ldquo;It means so much to me that you approve.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony strides out the door, calling a taxi and flashing him the address on his phone. He isn&rsquo;t here to make friends. He doesn&rsquo;t even need them. Never has. He&rsquo;s just here to solve crimes. One more distraction so he doesn&rsquo;t think of her-</p><p>No. </p><p>No more of that. </p><p>He has bigger fish to fry anyway. </p><p>He arrives at a cul-de-sac in a nicer end of town. The house is large, a well-maintained front lawn hosting an array of shrubbery and flowers meticulously groomed. Tony&rsquo;s senses go into hyperdrive. The smell of the gardenias, the number of windows, no marks on the ground. He catches sight of a muddy footprint, slammed into the front door as though to break it open. He can see the wear on the hinges, the streak of the mud as the man slid his foot off. Size eleven. Boot style. </p><p>Fury steps in front of him. &ldquo;First respondents found signs of a struggle in the kitchen and in the master bedroom.&rdquo; Tony makes no sign of listening, pulling out his phone and typing quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;But no Ms. Delaney.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony pauses. &ldquo;Ransom demand?&rdquo;</p><p>Fury shakes his head and Tony frowns like he&rsquo;s in thought before walking past him and the other detectives crowding around the kitchen. The detectives are already inside, but Tony heeds them no mind. He traces his way through the house imagining dozens of scenarios all at once, eliminating each one the evidence disproves it. He heads straight to the living room, examining the bland art all rich people had on their walls, but pausing at a set of photographs hanging neatly in a 3x3 grid on the wall. The first column has two rectangular frames of couple photos, the middle column two oval frames with just who he assumes is Mr. Delany, and the final column another set of rectangular couple photos. </p><p>He can sense Fury watching him and he&rsquo;s proven right when moments later he asks, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t look back at him, peering at the photos, something odd tickling him but nothing specific. &ldquo;Not sure.&rdquo; he admits.</p><p>Fury scoffs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a first.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I guarantee I still know more than the rest of your detectives combined though.&rdquo; Tony turns around, a challenge in his raised brows. &ldquo;Wanna bet captain?&rdquo; </p><p>Fury raises his hands in the hair, &ldquo;Hey, hey, I&rsquo;m just here to facilitate your re-entry. No need to go all feral.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony gives him a look before staring at the pictures again. &ldquo;Did you find her phone yet or is that still gone too?&rdquo;</p><p>A detective Tony hasn&rsquo;t met yet- nor does he want to- rushes over to hand it to Fury when he asks and Tony wastes no time going through it to find what he needs. He slides through Ms. Delany&rsquo;s photos, an attractive women in her thirties with dyed red hair and compares them to the ones on the wall. &ldquo;Alright so she either lost a crazy amount of weight in what has to be two weeks, which is ridiculously unlikely, or she had a crazy amount of plastic surgery in the past two years.&rdquo; Tony clicks the phone shut. &ldquo;More likely.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury squints. &ldquo;She looks the exact same in both photos Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony whirls around, holding a finger in the air. &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; he gestures to the wall. &ldquo;Look at the frames. The oval ones are older, been here longer, but the square frames are newer. And which ones feature Ms. Delaney.&rdquo; Fury flattens his expression. Tony raises a brow, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t start believing in coincidences since I&rsquo;ve been gone have you Captain?&rdquo;</p><p>Fury gives him half a scoff. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright look.&rdquo; Tony pulls out her cellphone again, &ldquo;She has tons of pics of herself all pretty and glamorous, but after two years? Poof. Not a single photo. But there are tons of everyone else. Surgery.&rdquo; he singsongs. </p><p>Fury still looks unconvinced, but Tony really doesn&rsquo;t need Fury&rsquo;s approval and stalks off, bending at the carpet to sniff at it, waving his hand to waft up any lingering scent. Everything is a clue and yet no one ever seemed to look. </p><p>Standing up abruptly, Tony decides to join the party in the kitchen, walking in on Rogers scribbling in his notebook while Odinson stares at the glass shards on the floor. There&rsquo;s a smear of blood next to the pieces and the glass appears to be the remains of a cup. Rogers looks up from his notepad, looking at him like he doesn&rsquo;t belong, but Tony ignores him, &ldquo;Fury! Get in here!&rdquo;</p><p>Rogers snaps his notepad shut, crossing his arms and shifting his stance to express his disapproval. Tony rolls his eyes. Odinson steps back, cocking his head like Tony is a circus trick he&rsquo;d been wanting to see all day. All right. They wanted a show? He&rsquo;d give them a show.</p><p>Tony steps back, planting his feet apart, hands clasped in front of him. &ldquo;Get ready to be blown away kids.&rdquo; with a dramatic flourish, Tony points to the glass. &ldquo;Ms. Delaney knew her attacker. She let him right in actually.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers scoffs, &ldquo;Captain are we seriously going to waste our time-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony carries on like Rogers hadn&rsquo;t said anything at all. &ldquo;There are <i>two</i> broken glasses on the floor, if you had bothered to count the number of shards you probably could&rsquo;ve deduced that yourself, but,&rdquo; Tony shrugs, his expression unreadable, &ldquo;obviously, she was pouring a glass of water for her guest before he assaulted her.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers nods condescendingly, &ldquo;Right, yeah, that makes sense. That&rsquo;s exactly what I would do after some guy busts down my door.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers stares him down until Tony sighs, crouching to the floor to dig around under the fridge before pulling out a solid piece of the cup; the perfectly intact base that matched another base in the pile on the floor. &ldquo;Two bases. Two cups Mr. Skeptic.&rdquo; </p><p>Odinson grins a little. &ldquo;Alright Stark. Two glasses. But how do you explain the footprint?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never ask.&rdquo; Pulling out his phone, Tony holds out the snapshot he took of the footprint. &ldquo;If you look closer, you can see a drop of blood near the sole. I guarantee if you run it through the lab it&rsquo;ll turn up a positive for Ms. Delaney&rsquo;s blood. And?&rdquo; he holds out his arms, &ldquo;How could that blood have gotten there?&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers scowls. </p><p>Tony grins. &ldquo;The blood on his shoe is proof that he made that print <i>after</i> getting to our victim. Not before. That means she knew her attacker and he tried to hide it.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony steps out the kitchen, patting Rogers on the chest, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry big guy, you&rsquo;ll catch up.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s halfway to the living room before he calls out, &ldquo;Oh. And he took something too. Where&rsquo;s Mr. Delaney?&rdquo; </p><p>A sheepish man with round-rimmed glasses and a tweed coat is brought into the room. Tony wastes no time. &ldquo;Over there, on that table. Something&rsquo;s missing. What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could you possibly know if something was missing?&rdquo; Rogers bites.</p><p>Tony makes a frustrated noise in the back of his throat, his antsy energy giving him a spazzy quality as he walks to the centre of the room. &ldquo;If you could pay attention, you&rsquo;d see that everything in this room is perfectly symmetrical. Two side tables, six picture frames, three decorative objects, only two there. Something&rsquo;s missing. You can even tell from the slight discolouration of the wood.&rdquo; impatiently, Tony turns back to Mr. Delaney, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I, yes. There was&hellip;That was where Annabelle kept her mother&rsquo;s music box.&rdquo; </p><p>Just like that, Tony&rsquo;s lively demeanor disappears. He looks almost deflated, like he had heard something he expected but still wished were unreal. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; </p><p>Ignoring everyone, Tony turns immediately for the stairs. He finds the bedroom with no trouble. Predictably, the rest followed. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a kidnapping case anymore.&rdquo; Tony looks at the bed sheets in disarray and the lamp pushed from its place on the bedside table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a murder.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stark, you&rsquo;ve been right so far. But there&rsquo;s no body.&rdquo; Odinson says, scrutinizing the rest of the room. </p><p>But Tony can&rsquo;t stop looking at the lamp and there&rsquo;s the scent of blood in the room. He can&rsquo;t see any. But he knows it&rsquo;s there. The hypersensitivity of his nose won&rsquo;t let him be until he finds it. His eyes draw back to the lamp. He jolts, swivelling around to face the detectives. He holds his arms out like a child trying to fly and skids down the room before shaking his head and trying again. </p><p>&ldquo;Captain-&rdquo; Rogers says, no doubt trying to complain more, but Fury just raises a hand, watching Tony silently.</p><p>Tony slides down again before stopping, an eerie expression on his face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the safe room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What safe room?&rdquo; Fury asks, voice low. </p><p>Tony points behind him. &ldquo;The one behind that wall.&rdquo; he says, nonchalant. </p><p>Rogers uncrosses his arms, stepping forward. &ldquo;Her husband didn&rsquo;t say anything about that.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony shrugs. &ldquo;He probably didn&rsquo;t know. But look,&rdquo; he plucks a marble out of the decorative bowl across them, &ldquo;all that reinforced steel makes the floor just the slightest bit uneven because of all that extra weight.&rdquo; He drops the marble, eyes locked on it as it rolls slowly but steadily down towards the wall. </p><p>Eyes drawn again to the lamp, Tony shoves his fingers behind the night stand, fiddling around until he found what he was looking for. He presses the switch and the wall behind him moves to reveal a small steel room. The marble rolls inside before coming to a complete stop as it gets trapped in a pool of blood.</p><p>Annabelle Delaney&rsquo;s eyes are vacant. </p><p>Tony looks away. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t usually hope I&rsquo;m wrong&hellip;but this time, I really wish I was.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p> &ldquo;Alright so a little bit of salt&hellip;&rdquo; Peter mutters to himself, tossing in a dash or two into the boiling water before stirring in the pasta. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok Google, set timer for eight minutes.&rdquo; His old Galaxy 4 vibrates as the command goes through and Peter leaves to go sit at the kitchen table, filling out math homework sheets while he waits for the food to cook.</p><p>He&rsquo;s lost in thought solving quadratic equations when his phone blares violently. Jolted from his focus, Peter grabs the phone, relaxing when he sees General Heart Hospital as the caller ID. Oh. Just May then. He doesn&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;d call from her work rather than use her cell, but Peter answers the call, a smile on his lips. &ldquo;Hey May, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p>The person on the other line takes a breath. It sounds almost sad. &ldquo;Is this Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter furrows his brows. &ldquo;Marisa?&rdquo; </p><p>Marisa&rsquo;s one of May&rsquo;s nurse friends. She&rsquo;d been over a few times, enough for Peter to vaguely remember the way she speaks, but he has no clue why she&rsquo;s calling. &ldquo;Peter, you need to come to the hospital. It&rsquo;s May.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s entire world dissolves.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been in a car accident. And it&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; Peter doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it. </p><p>Absolutely cannot hear it. Not May. Not to him. Not to them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming. I&rsquo;m coming. Please- just- just-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do our best Peter.&rdquo; Marisa promises softly.</p><p>But Peter already knows it won&rsquo;t be good enough. It never is with the Parkers. And always, always. He&rsquo;s the one left behind. &nbsp;</p><p>Peter sprints the entire way. He&rsquo;s restless on the subway, jumpy and frantic. When he races into the hospital, he navigates the familiar halls until he gets to reception. Hala&rsquo;s expression saddens, a weathered strength of constantly losing and saving souls in her eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in surgery, you know where to go.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity to remember to be polite before he&rsquo;s running down the hall. He turns the corner, bumping into a doctor, a built guy twice his size with a forester type beard and unexpressive eyes. Peter mumbles an apology, not really caring much about anything until he gets to the surgery wing. He collapses on the waiting chair. Someone comes to talk to him. The clock is ticking in the background. The tears blur the ugly table and magazines and other crying people. </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t know how long he waits. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t feel much of anything anymore. He replays their final moments together. Not bad. Sweet. Tender. Not enough though. Should have been more. They deserve more. May. May. May. He just wants his aunt. He just wants May. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s head falls into his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;May Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chokes. Launching upwards, all but running in the surgeon&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Yes. Me. That&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;m Peter. Her nephew. Is she-is she okay?&rdquo; the surgeon looks like he&rsquo;s about to frown, give his typical I&rsquo;m so sorry we did everything we could speech and Peter shakes his head, &ldquo;No-please. Please don&rsquo;t tell me-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I think we should sit down.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter can&rsquo;t feel his legs. He can&rsquo;t feel his own heartbeat. He&rsquo;s led back to the waiting room chairs and he falls into the seat. Just&hellip;falls. &ldquo;Peter, your aunt was involved in a car accident. On-lookers say she was acting erratically in the car right before it happened. She lost control of the wheel and crashed into the side of a building.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gapes. What the- what the <i>hell</i> is this guy saying to him right now? May is-was? No, she- she drove more safely than anyone Peter knew. And she would never- she would never <i>do </i>that- that wasn&rsquo;t- that wasn&rsquo;t <i>her</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;What does that even mean? That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo; he insists, trying to show the universe it was wrong- it was wrong to take May Parker because this wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be how it ended. It <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>.</p><p>The surgeon softens again. &ldquo;Peter&hellip;were you aware that your aunt was on anti-depressants?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s face slackens. Incredulity written in every sharp edge. &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;First responders found a prescription bottle for bupropion in her purse and judging from the medication label and the quantity, it seems she was taking more than the recommended dose. We tested her blood and it confirmed our hypothesis. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of the medication is inducing first-time seizures in individuals not typically pre-disposed to them and based on witness statements, we believe this was all a tragic mistake.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter stands up, legs quivering. &ldquo;Of course this is a tragic mistake. You- you don&rsquo;t know her. She wasn&rsquo;t depressed and she wasn&rsquo;t taking medicine and she- this makes no sense! This makes no goddamn sense!!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s yelling now and he&rsquo;s making a scene but he can&rsquo;t help it because this isn&rsquo;t right, it isn&rsquo;t right.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter rips his arm away, running back down the hall intent on finding Marisa.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Hala. Ms. Hala, I need Marisa, where is she? I need to talk to her. Please.&rdquo; the receptionist frowns, glancing at him and then the screen, conflict in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter I&rsquo;m not sure-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Hala <i>please</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>She stares at him a bit longer before acquiescing, looking through the schedules. &ldquo;She should be attending the fourth floor today.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter runs two steps a time yelling Marisa&rsquo;s name. He finds her when she pokes her head out, tears filling her eyes the second she sees him. &ldquo;Oh Peter.&rdquo; her voice wobbles and suddenly he&rsquo;s in her arms. &ldquo;I wanted to find you after I heard but I needed to stay here.&rdquo; </p><p>He pulls away quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; he says, cavalier, &ldquo;Did you hear what they&rsquo;re saying about her? About May?&rdquo; </p><p>She stares at him wide eyed. &ldquo;Peter honey what are you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was she taking anti-depressants?&rdquo; Peter pushes, every part of him pleading.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t- I don&rsquo;t know Peter. I don&rsquo;t know. But they found the bottle in her purse and May&rsquo;s been-&rdquo; pain paints a shadow across her face, &ldquo;May had been acting weird for weeks now. It wouldn&rsquo;t be the most surprising thing.&rdquo;</p><p>The world freezes around him. May <i>had</i> been weird. Evasive, paranoid, scared. She said she had to take care of something. Something important that she couldn&rsquo;t tell Peter. Did she mean this? Her mental health? Depression?? Why wouldn&rsquo;t she have said anything? Why wouldn&rsquo;t she tell <i>him</i>?</p><p>He must&rsquo;ve said it out loud because suddenly Marisa has him in her arms again and she&rsquo;s patting his head. &ldquo;Oh Peter. She probably just didn&rsquo;t want you to worry.&rdquo; </p><p>But that&rsquo;s <i>bullshit</i> and Peter pulls away. &ldquo;No. This isn&rsquo;t right. It isn&rsquo;t right!&rdquo; and he turns in the other direction and runs as fast as he can go. </p><p>He squints as the sunlight pierces through his eyes as he surges out the hospital, fumbling to pull his phone out of his pocket. He calls an Uber and feels clenched right down to his atoms as they drive down the crowded New York city streets. They pull up at his apartment and he storms into it, throwing open his door as though he can find answers where there were none before. He stumbles inside, everything in the apartment hurts him now. Taunts him. Every surface is a memory of May and he can&rsquo;t deal with that right now. </p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>How was he supposed to move on when everything was wrong?? </p><p>He bursts into May&rsquo;s room, determined to find something to prove- to prove what? Peter stops, his breathing heavy. If May&rsquo;s crash wasn&rsquo;t an accident, then that meant it was a&hellip;Peter shakes. He doesn&rsquo;t know which one is worse. May was a nurse. She saved people for a living. She was kind and funny and witty and down-to-earth and it couldn&rsquo;t be possible&hellip;</p><p>Peter tears apart her room anyway. </p><p>He throws open drawers and rifles through her things and ransacks anything that could hide a secret worth killing over. Finally, he finds it. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a medical file, swiped from the hospital. George Miller. Age seventy-three. Died from heart failure. Ruled: natural causes. It&rsquo;s May&rsquo;s handwriting. Peter knows it. He flips through to the bottom where the previous notes are and finds his brows furrowing. May had combed through her notes, highlighting as she went. George was fine, feeling good that morning. And then died of a heart attack two hours later. </p><p>And that isn&rsquo;t suspicious. People die all of the sudden every day. But May&rsquo;s hand-writing is frantic in the margins <i>WHAT ABOUT THE ISCHEMIA?? WHAT ABOUT THE MARK?? </i>It was underlined four times. </p><p>Peter drops the file, pulling out his phone and googling everything he didn&rsquo;t know. Ischemia: reduced blood flow preventing the heart from receiving oxygen. A severe blockage of one of the heart&rsquo;s arteries that can lead to a heart attack. Peter squints, so then it <i>was </i>natural. </p><p>Peter flips back in May&rsquo;s notes, where she&rsquo;s highlighted the epinephrine dose over and over. Something connecting in the back of his mind, he googles ischemia ephinephrine and is bombarded by academic journal after academic journal detailing the link in adrenaline causing ischemia&hellip;and leaving that distinctive mark. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for the epinephrine given <i>after</i> the heart attack to save the man to cause the ischemia. There would have had to be more of the drug in his blood for to it have that lethal effect. That means-</p><p>Peter falls to the floor. </p><p>George Miller was murdered. And May had figured it out. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you it wasn&rsquo;t an accident!&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s yelling in the middle of the NYPD seventh precinct and twelve hours ago he would have died at the thought, but he can&rsquo;t be stopped now.</p><p>The detective, Rogers, he thinks, tries to drop a comforting hand on his shoulder but Peter shirks back, glaring. &ldquo;Son. I know it&rsquo;s hard when a loved one dies but we did all the checks-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You evidently didn&rsquo;t- if you had, you would have seen this!&rdquo; Peter waves the file in Rogers&rsquo; face but the man doesn&rsquo;t lose his cool, just keeps giving him that same placating face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter can hear the door to the captain&rsquo;s office open and close shut and hopes he isn&rsquo;t going to kick him out. But Peter has to keep trying. He has to. The only thing keeping the grief that threatens to consume him whole and leave nothing at all is his mission to bring his aunt justice. &ldquo;What do you mean there&rsquo;s nothing you can do? It says so right in the file! George Miller was murdered and it looked like an accident because the epinephrine that killed him got disguised by the epinephrine the doctors used to resuscitate him!&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers narrows his eyes, his arms unclenching from where they were crossed at his chest and Peter thinks finally he&rsquo;s gotten through to him when the file is snatched from his hand by someone behind him. Peter whirls around, gaping at a man with the most chiseled goatee, skimming over the file, lips pursed. &ldquo;Your aunt. How did she die?&rdquo; the man says and Peter&rsquo;s too taken aback to tell him he really doesn&rsquo;t have any authority to go asking questions.</p><p>&ldquo;A car accident.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you think someone tampered with the car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Someone put a bottle of anti-depressants in her purse- um, bu-&rdquo; he frowns.</p><p>&ldquo;Bupropion.&rdquo; The man supplies.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;that. They said she took too many of the pills and she had a seizure in the car so she lost control. And then she-&rdquo; Peter trails off, just looking at the man, expression saying it all. </p><p>The man frowns, lip tugging in sympathy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry kid. But if it makes you feel any better, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widen. His heart hammers in his throat. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p>The goatee guy snaps the file shut, staring him right in the eye. &ldquo;The man, Miller, he was murdered.&rdquo; </p><p>Rogers stands up, &ldquo;Stark you really think it&rsquo;s a good idea to say that to him right now?&rdquo; </p><p>The man- Stark- tilts his head like a challenge, &ldquo;Say what? The truth?&rdquo; he looks back at Peter, completely ignoring the detective, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your case. I&rsquo;m waiting for some DNA evidence anyway. You have school or something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-no sir.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Great. Then you can come with me to the hospital. Fill me in on absolutely everything you know. Even the smallest detail could be important.&rdquo;</p><p>The man turns abruptly, speed-walking out of the bullpen and Peter jumps to match his pace. &ldquo;Wait. Are you a detective here?&rdquo;</p><p>The man curls his nose. &ldquo;God no. I&rsquo;m a consultant.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s expression scrunches. &ldquo;So like&hellip;you consult on crime?&rdquo;</p><p>The man sighs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m what they call the department&rsquo;s last resort. A tricky case no one has the handle on? They call me.&rdquo; he glances at Peter from the corner of his eye. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;ll see the show soon enough. But for now, all you need to know is that I&rsquo;m Tony Stark. And I&rsquo;m going to catch whoever did this to your aunt.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Struggling to maintain his sobriety after a tragedy in London forced him overseas, Tony learns that what mends hearts might not be at the bottom of a bottle but something like a string of unsolved murders and perhaps even love. <br /></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19031392/chapters/45200047#main\" target=\"_blank\">AO3 Link</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ndash;o00o&ndash;</p>\n<p>Fury stares him down, his one eye tunneling through his words to grasp at his intentions. Tony sits very still. Back straight. Attentive. Not shirking away from the intensity that threatens to reveal him whole. </p>\n<p>Fury stares some more, then cracks a grin and leans back into his chair. &ldquo;Tony Stark.&rdquo; he drawls, &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d see you again.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tony quirks his brows. &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d come to this side of the world either.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>The blare of honking drivers and the faint thrum of the subway reverberate in the New York City air. Tony breathes through it, his hyper-sensitivity forces the scratching of Officer Blair&rsquo;s Lotto card from the next room into his ear-drums, he hears the sound of two copiers churning out the contents of police files, a woman laughing into the phone. The NYPD&rsquo;s seventh precinct has never once been quiet, but the cacophony of it all suits Captain Nick Fury just fine. </p>\n<p>Tony thinks he could get used to it. </p>\n<p>Fury&rsquo;s tone says relax, but Tony&rsquo;s in the lion&rsquo;s den and he isn&rsquo;t one to forget it. &ldquo;You staying here for the next while?&rdquo; Fury asks, hands clasped over the desk. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Permanently.&rdquo; Tony says immediately. </p>\n<p>Unconsciously, his fingers grip into the handles of his chair. Fury&rsquo;s eyes dart to his tense knuckles but they&rsquo;re back on his face just as quickly. &ldquo;Okay. Anything I need to know about?&rdquo; he stares at him meaningfully but Tony doesn&rsquo;t take the bait. </p>\n<p>His jaw tightens. &ldquo;Nothing you haven&rsquo;t already snooped out.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s foot starts shaking, something antsy crawling all over him. &ldquo;Are we done yet? With all this have my daughter home my eight stuff or can we get to what&rsquo;s actually important?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Fury almost looks amused. &ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tony stands up, plants both hands on his desk. &ldquo;The case.&rdquo; </p>\n<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;o00o&ndash;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Peter! Have you seen my keys? They&rsquo;re not on the thing!&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Twisting his lip, Peter pauses mid-bite. &ldquo;I think&hellip;maybe&hellip;wait didn&rsquo;t you put them in your jacket yesterday?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>May smacks a hand to her forehead groaning. Peter snickers into his cereal, &ldquo;Peter make sure you always put your stuff back in the same place.&rdquo; he mimics, laughing at her half-hearted glare.</p>\n<p>Hands on her hips, May tries to look stern but she can&rsquo;t help but laugh, &ldquo;Way to kick a girl when she&rsquo;s down Pete.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Peter flashes a cheeky grin before May runs back into her bedroom, pulling out her spring jacket and digging into the pockets with a quick, &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; before rushing back to him.</p>\n<p>All at once, the light-heartedness in her eyes fades and something haunted clouds the brown of her eyes. May looks at him for a moment, imperceptibly biting her lip before taking three steps towards him and pulling him in for a tight hug. &ldquo;May?&rdquo; his fingers grip the back of her shirt.</p>\n<p>He feels her take a deep breath from where she&rsquo;s pressed against his shoulder before she pulls away slowly. &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; he asks again, gentler this time.</p>\n<p>Her smile is small, but she brushes the hair from his eyes like she&rsquo;s done a thousand times before and Peter has the strangest feeling that he should be trying to memorize this moment. &ldquo;Nothing sweetie. I just really love you, you know that?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Peter smiles, a little wary, a little touched, &ldquo;Yeah. I love you too May.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>She smiles at him again and he watches her leave to work with questions in his eyes. &ldquo;Are you coming back at seven today?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Earlier probably.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something weird in how she says it, but Peter can&rsquo;t put his finger on it. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ok great! I&rsquo;ll make some pasta or something and we can eat together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>May shoots him a grateful smile before waving her goodbyes. The door clicks shut behind her and Peter finds himself faltering in the silence. May was usually an open book, but today- not just today- the past while&hellip;she&rsquo;d been keeping something back. Not hiding, just&hellip;keeping. He&rsquo;d ask her about it tonight. Whatever it was, maybe he could help her. Or at least try. </p>\n<p>Resolved, Peter quickly washes his dishes and grabs his backpack. School first, then Decathalon practice, and then May. Yeah, that sounds good. He has all the time in the world. </p>\n</p>",

You now have the job of collecting intel before missions on your own now, a task you have done four times now. Along with this lengthening of your leash, you have been thrillingly sneaking around with Tony. Anywhere you guys would pass each other a kiss would be shared, the occasional make-out session would also occur, time permitting. When you would attend Avengers meetings, sultry looks would be shared between you two across the room, but dispelling any suspicion by sharing snarky remarks. Even though the familiarity of your relationship was comfortable, today seemed like a day where things would take a turn. Your heels rhythmically tap along the floor as you walk to the board room where your presence was requested. You enter the door but stay in the door frame, holding your hands in front of you. Your greeted by the eyes of Nat, Wanda, and Vision. Steve was also in the room but his focus stayed on whatever was in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou summoned me?\u201d You smirk at Steve and slowly head towards where he is seated.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI need you to bring this to Tony.\u201d Steve hands you a file then looks up, shock in his eyes for a brief moment. He quickly scanned your outfit, the sheer pink top with material that wasn\u2019t see-through but thin enough that flowed with the slightest of movement, the black pencil skirt the hits just above your knee and hugs your curves beautifully, and how your new bobbed twists frame your face perfectly. \u201cYou look\u2026different.\u201d You grab the file from his hand and hug it close to your chest.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d You grin and turn to walk out of the room. \u201cI\u2019ll get this to Tony right away.\u201d You wave the file in the air as you exit the still silent room, stunned by your new display of confidence. You continue through the compound, head to the elevator and press the button for the lower level. It makes its way down and as it moves, you mess with your hair and fix the way your shirt was tucked into your skirt. The elevator stops and opens and you take a deep breath before exiting and making your way down the stairs. Once you get to the door you knock on the glass and wave when you see Tony lookup. A second later the door opens up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWelcome, Ms. Fury.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y greets you as you walk in. You smile at her soothing voice as you make your way over to Tony who was focusing on something at his workbench. You peck his cheek but garner no attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve wanted me to give you these.\u201d You toss the file on the workbench and work your arms around Tony\u2019s torso, setting your chin on his shoulder. You move your hands up to feel his chest through his shirt. \u201cYou know, all work and no play makes Tony a dull boy.\u201d You trace your finger over his collarbone and kiss his earlobe, lips tracing down his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been working on this for three days now. I\u2019m on the verge of figuring it out and I hit a wall.\u201d Tony reaches back to your head and gently runs his hand over your twists then lean his head on yours. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can distract you for a moment. Maybe relieve your mental block.\u201d You begin to slowly move your hands down but Tony lightly grasps your wrists and turns so he\u2019s facing you. He still held his grip on your wrists as he drapes your arms over his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would like that a lot, Ms. Fury.\u201d Tony wraps his arms around your waist to pull you into a passionate heated kiss. The level of passion that was so quickly achieved seemed almost automatic due to the number of make-out sessions that proceeded this. But this was different, this felt different. Tony\u2019s hands began to roam your back, one had docking on your butt and the other pulling you closer via your upper back. You two turn around so your back was now toward the workbench. Tony walks you backwards until your butt hits the workbench and, in what seemed to be unison, you jumped onto the workbench just as Tony went to lift you onto it. He separates your legs and steps forward, bringing himself closer to you, causing your skirt to move up. You two pull away for a moment to catch your breath, and you watch Tony\u2019s face as his eyes wander down your body. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d Tony points at your light pink thong then places his hand on your now exposed thigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot exactly. I wanted every part of my fit to be poppin\u2019 today and these just so happened to be included. Your love for it is just a bonus.\u201d You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won\u2019t be affected if you lost these\u2026\u201d He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.\u201d You tug at the hem of his shirt. \u201cTake it off.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can make this pretty sexy, you know?\u201d He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn\u2019t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back. Your hands absentmindedly move up the back of his head, simultaneously pulling his head closer. Once he reaches your collarbone, he pulls back and begins to unbutton your blouse but not having enough patience to untuck it from your skirt. He then reaches around and unhooks your light pink bra that purposefully matched your underwear, letting the bra fall but not come completely off. He leans back and looked at you, making his mildly satisfied head shake that he does when he creates something extraordinary and tries to downplay it for his own ego. You smack his arm and laugh as he came back in, kissing your collarbone and continuing to move down until he catches your nipple. He takes the nub in his mouth, sucking it and swirling his tongue around it, then moves to the other one. While he worked on your breast, one of his hands roamed down to your pussy, running his index finger up your wet slit to your clit, rubbing circles and then removing his finger. He leaves your breast and looks into your eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I made you feel this way.\u201d He smirks then places his index finger in his mouth, tasting your juices. He kisses you hard, making you taste yourself on his tongue.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPolicy.\u201d You sing, reminding him when he pulls away. He lowers his hand to you slit again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow about you remove it, but you have to do it while I make you squirm.\u201d He rubs your clit, then inserts a finger inside you. You gasp, but accept his challenge, running your hands down his abdomen to his belt buckle. He begins to move his finger in and out, getting enough lubrication then adding another finger. You moan as he moves his fingers but continue with his buckle, unlatching it and pulling it apart. He begins to circle your clit with his thumb as he continues to pump his fingers in and out of you. You stop at the sudden flow of pleasure, grabbing onto him and clawing into his back. After taking a few deep breaths, you continue with his pants, unbuttoning them and undoing the zipper. He shifts the motion of his fingers to long and slow, making you involuntarily grind your hips for a moment, but you gain enough sanity back to push down his pants and underwear enough for his dick to spring out. You look up into his eyes and give him a sultry smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI win.\u201d You wrap your hand around him begin to move your hand up and down, slowly. \u201cIn more ways than one. Very well endowed, I see\u2026\u201d You move your hand a bit faster for a moment then stop, still holding on. He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers. He then reaches to a drawer in the workbench that you didn\u2019t seem to notice, pulling out a condom.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have a condom in there.\u201d You laugh, stroking his facial hair. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou never know what fun you\u2019ll catch yourself in.\u201d He opens it and slips it onto himself. \u201cThere are at least three in every drawer in here, and I change them regularly.\u201d He slips your shirt off your shoulder a bit more and pepper kisses along it. You copy his mildly satisfied face making Tony laugh and beam at you. His smile makes his eyes crinkle, and you match his loving smile with your own. He runs his hand up your thigh taking your skirt with it, lifting it to the point where your butt really touched the cold metal of the workbench. His hand finally makes its way to your lower back, pulling you closer to him. He slowly leans in and kisses you, soft but filled with passion. He pulls away and looks down to line himself up with your slit, pushing in slowly, making you whimper. He places his forehead on yours and once all the way in, he slowly pulls out, this action making you lowly gasp. He continues this motion, speeding up with each thrust, and subsequently filling the lab with louder sultry moans and groans. You reach down and rub your clit for a minute, enhancing your pleasure ten fold, but Tony reaches down and removes it, placing it back on the table. You look up at him, ecstasy and betrayal on your face and not even a second later, Tony replaces your hand with his own, rubbing your clit at varying speeds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAhhh, yes! Fuck, Mr. Stark!\u201d You throw your head back and grasp on two him, scratching his back with full knowledge and anticipation for the scars that will be left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou like that? Well, I like it when you call me Mr. Stark.\u201d He whisper and bites your shoulder, continuing to thrust and rub, the sound of his belt buckle rattling fading in with the whimpers dripping from your mouth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The room continued to be filled with moans, groans, cursing, and the occasional \u201cMr. Stark\u201d which would then be followed by another hearty groan as you two headed to your climaxes. His thrusts got faster and wilder as your grip on his back intensified. The rubbing he was doing on your clit increased in speed in reaction to him getting closer and losing all control of his body movements. In no time your reached your screaming point, grateful that you were far away from anyone that could hear you two. Tony continued to rub and thrust, reassuring you that he was close as you shook into your orgasm. Soon after he thrusted one final thrust, groaning as he came in the condom, he gradually slows his hand to stop on your clit but leaves it there for a moment longer. He lays his head on your shoulder as both of your breath heavily, trying to catch your breath, and then removes himself from you, taking the condom off and throwing it away. You can feel him smiling into your shoulder, making you smile as you lean your head on his. Suddenly there was a knock on the glass door, making you both jump. Tony quickly looks up then pulls you down to the floor from the workbench.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOw! What the fuck?!\u201d You curse, then follow Tony\u2019s gaze to the door, only peeking your head above the table. Out the door you see Steve, who was turned around and seemed to be blushing down his arms, and Nat, who simply smirked and waved at you two. You slowly turn your head to Tony to look at him with concern.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, at least we had fun.\u201d He grins, making you laugh and hit his arm.</p><p>_____</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You guys make your way up to the open living room/kitchen area where everyone seemed to be gathered, following Tony to the couch where he sat in the last available spot then pats his lap to prompt you to sit, and you do so. You wrap your arms around his neck and watch as everyone except for Clint seems to hand Nat a twenty dollar bill, which she hands half of the collection to Clint. You tilt your head at her and what for an answer for your seemingly obvious, unspoken question.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou seemed like his type.\u201d She shrugs and smiles at you, then hands you one of her twenties. You accept it with a straight face and stuff it your bra, then grin at the somber mood that fell over the room for a moment. Everyone begins to chat again and you turn your head to look at Tony, giving him one last small kiss before engaging in the conversation.</p>",

You now have the job of collecting intel before missions on your own now, a task you have done four times now. Along with this lengthening of your leash, you have been thrillingly sneaking around with Tony. Anywhere you guys would pass each other a kiss would be shared, the occasional make-out session would also occur, time permitting. When you would attend Avengers meetings, sultry looks would be shared between you two across the room, but dispelling any suspicion by sharing snarky remarks. Even though the familiarity of your relationship was comfortable, today seemed like a day where things would take a turn. Your heels rhythmically tap along the floor as you walk to the board room where your presence was requested. You enter the door but stay in the door frame, holding your hands in front of you. Your greeted by the eyes of Nat, Wanda, and Vision. Steve was also in the room but his focus stayed on whatever was in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou summoned me?\u201d You smirk at Steve and slowly head towards where he is seated.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI need you to bring this to Tony.\u201d Steve hands you a file then looks up, shock in his eyes for a brief moment. He quickly scanned your outfit, the sheer pink top with material that wasn\u2019t see-through but thin enough that flowed with the slightest of movement, the black pencil skirt the hits just above your knee and hugs your curves beautifully, and how your new bobbed twists frame your face perfectly. \u201cYou look\u2026different.\u201d You grab the file from his hand and hug it close to your chest.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d You grin and turn to walk out of the room. \u201cI\u2019ll get this to Tony right away.\u201d You wave the file in the air as you exit the still silent room, stunned by your new display of confidence. You continue through the compound, head to the elevator and press the button for the lower level. It makes its way down and as it moves, you mess with your hair and fix the way your shirt was tucked into your skirt. The elevator stops and opens and you take a deep breath before exiting and making your way down the stairs. Once you get to the door you knock on the glass and wave when you see Tony lookup. A second later the door opens up.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWelcome, Ms. Fury.\u201d F.R.I.D.A.Y greets you as you walk in. You smile at her soothing voice as you make your way over to Tony who was focusing on something at his workbench. You peck his cheek but garner no attention.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSteve wanted me to give you these.\u201d You toss the file on the workbench and work your arms around Tony\u2019s torso, setting your chin on his shoulder. You move your hands up to feel his chest through his shirt. \u201cYou know, all work and no play makes Tony a dull boy.\u201d You trace your finger over his collarbone and kiss his earlobe, lips tracing down his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been working on this for three days now. I\u2019m on the verge of figuring it out and I hit a wall.\u201d Tony reaches back to your head and gently runs his hand over your twists then lean his head on yours. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can distract you for a moment. Maybe relieve your mental block.\u201d You begin to slowly move your hands down but Tony lightly grasps your wrists and turns so he\u2019s facing you. He still held his grip on your wrists as he drapes your arms over his neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would like that a lot, Ms. Fury.\u201d Tony wraps his arms around your waist to pull you into a passionate heated kiss. The level of passion that was so quickly achieved seemed almost automatic due to the number of make-out sessions that proceeded this. But this was different, this felt different. Tony\u2019s hands began to roam your back, one had docking on your butt and the other pulling you closer via your upper back. You two turn around so your back was now toward the workbench. Tony walks you backwards until your butt hits the workbench and, in what seemed to be unison, you jumped onto the workbench just as Tony went to lift you onto it. He separates your legs and steps forward, bringing himself closer to you, causing your skirt to move up. You two pull away for a moment to catch your breath, and you watch Tony\u2019s face as his eyes wander down your body. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d Tony points at your light pink thong then places his hand on your now exposed thigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot exactly. I wanted every part of my fit to be poppin\u2019 today and these just so happened to be included. Your love for it is just a bonus.\u201d You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won\u2019t be affected if you lost these\u2026\u201d He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.\u201d You tug at the hem of his shirt. \u201cTake it off.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can make this pretty sexy, you know?\u201d He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn\u2019t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back. Your hands absentmindedly move up the back of his head, simultaneously pulling his head closer. Once he reaches your collarbone, he pulls back and begins to unbutton your blouse but not having enough patience to untuck it from your skirt. He then reaches around and unhooks your light pink bra that purposefully matched your underwear, letting the bra fall but not come completely off. He leans back and looked at you, making his mildly satisfied head shake that he does when he creates something extraordinary and tries to downplay it for his own ego. You smack his arm and laugh as he came back in, kissing your collarbone and continuing to move down until he catches your nipple. He takes the nub in his mouth, sucking it and swirling his tongue around it, then moves to the other one. While he worked on your breast, one of his hands roamed down to your pussy, running his index finger up your wet slit to your clit, rubbing circles and then removing his finger. He leaves your breast and looks into your eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I made you feel this way.\u201d He smirks then places his index finger in his mouth, tasting your juices. He kisses you hard, making you taste yourself on his tongue.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPolicy.\u201d You sing, reminding him when he pulls away. He lowers his hand to you slit again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow about you remove it, but you have to do it while I make you squirm.\u201d He rubs your clit, then inserts a finger inside you. You gasp, but accept his challenge, running your hands down his abdomen to his belt buckle. He begins to move his finger in and out, getting enough lubrication then adding another finger. You moan as he moves his fingers but continue with his buckle, unlatching it and pulling it apart. He begins to circle your clit with his thumb as he continues to pump his fingers in and out of you. You stop at the sudden flow of pleasure, grabbing onto him and clawing into his back. After taking a few deep breaths, you continue with his pants, unbuttoning them and undoing the zipper. He shifts the motion of his fingers to long and slow, making you involuntarily grind your hips for a moment, but you gain enough sanity back to push down his pants and underwear enough for his dick to spring out. You look up into his eyes and give him a sultry smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI win.\u201d You wrap your hand around him begin to move your hand up and down, slowly. \u201cIn more ways than one. Very well endowed, I see\u2026\u201d You move your hand a bit faster for a moment then stop, still holding on. He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers. He then reaches to a drawer in the workbench that you didn\u2019t seem to notice, pulling out a condom.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have a condom in there.\u201d You laugh, stroking his facial hair. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou never know what fun you\u2019ll catch yourself in.\u201d He opens it and slips it onto himself. \u201cThere are at least three in every drawer in here, and I change them regularly.\u201d He slips your shirt off your shoulder a bit more and pepper kisses along it. You copy his mildly satisfied face making Tony laugh and beam at you. His smile makes his eyes crinkle, and you match his loving smile with your own. He runs his hand up your thigh taking your skirt with it, lifting it to the point where your butt really touched the cold metal of the workbench. His hand finally makes its way to your lower back, pulling you closer to him. He slowly leans in and kisses you, soft but filled with passion. He pulls away and looks down to line himself up with your slit, pushing in slowly, making you whimper. He places his forehead on yours and once all the way in, he slowly pulls out, this action making you lowly gasp. He continues this motion, speeding up with each thrust, and subsequently filling the lab with louder sultry moans and groans. You reach down and rub your clit for a minute, enhancing your pleasure ten fold, but Tony reaches down and removes it, placing it back on the table. You look up at him, ecstasy and betrayal on your face and not even a second later, Tony replaces your hand with his own, rubbing your clit at varying speeds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAhhh, yes! Fuck, Mr. Stark!\u201d You throw your head back and grasp on two him, scratching his back with full knowledge and anticipation for the scars that will be left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou like that? Well, I like it when you call me Mr. Stark.\u201d He whisper and bites your shoulder, continuing to thrust and rub, the sound of his belt buckle rattling fading in with the whimpers dripping from your mouth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The room continued to be filled with moans, groans, cursing, and the occasional \u201cMr. Stark\u201d which would then be followed by another hearty groan as you two headed to your climaxes. His thrusts got faster and wilder as your grip on his back intensified. The rubbing he was doing on your clit increased in speed in reaction to him getting closer and losing all control of his body movements. In no time your reached your screaming point, grateful that you were far away from anyone that could hear you two. Tony continued to rub and thrust, reassuring you that he was close as you shook into your orgasm. Soon after he thrusted one final thrust, groaning as he came in the condom, he gradually slows his hand to stop on your clit but leaves it there for a moment longer. He lays his head on your shoulder as both of your breath heavily, trying to catch your breath, and then removes himself from you, taking the condom off and throwing it away. You can feel him smiling into your shoulder, making you smile as you lean your head on his. Suddenly there was a knock on the glass door, making you both jump. Tony quickly looks up then pulls you down to the floor from the workbench.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOw! What the fuck?!\u201d You curse, then follow Tony\u2019s gaze to the door, only peeking your head above the table. Out the door you see Steve, who was turned around and seemed to be blushing down his arms, and Nat, who simply smirked and waved at you two. You slowly turn your head to Tony to look at him with concern.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, at least we had fun.\u201d He grins, making you laugh and hit his arm.</p><p>_____</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You guys make your way up to the open living room/kitchen area where everyone seemed to be gathered, following Tony to the couch where he sat in the last available spot then pats his lap to prompt you to sit, and you do so. You wrap your arms around his neck and watch as everyone except for Clint seems to hand Nat a twenty dollar bill, which she hands half of the collection to Clint. You tilt your head at her and what for an answer for your seemingly obvious, unspoken question.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou seemed like his type.\u201d She shrugs and smiles at you, then hands you one of her twenties. You accept it with a straight face and stuff it your bra, then grin at the somber mood that fell over the room for a moment. Everyone begins to chat again and you turn your head to look at Tony, giving him one last small kiss before engaging in the conversation.</p></p>",

Your love for it is just a bonus.\u201d You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won\u2019t be affected if you lost these\u2026\u201d He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.\u201d You tug at the hem of his shirt. \u201cTake it off.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can make this pretty sexy, you know?\u201d He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn\u2019t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back. Your hands absentmindedly move up the back of his head, simultaneously pulling his head closer. Once he reaches your collarbone, he pulls back and begins to unbutton your blouse but not having enough patience to untuck it from your skirt. He then reaches around and unhooks your light pink bra that purposefully matched your underwear, letting the bra fall but not come completely off. He leans back and looked at you, making his mildly satisfied head shake that he does when he creates something extraordinary and tries to downplay it for his own ego. You smack his arm and laugh as he came back in, kissing your collarbone and continuing to move down until he catches your nipple. He takes the nub in his mouth, sucking it and swirling his tongue around it, then moves to the other one. While he worked on your breast, one of his hands roamed down to your pussy, running his index finger up your wet slit to your clit, rubbing circles and then removing his finger. He leaves your breast and looks into your eyes.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know I made you feel this way.\u201d He smirks then places his index finger in his mouth, tasting your juices. He kisses you hard, making you taste yourself on his tongue.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPolicy.\u201d You sing, reminding him when he pulls away. He lowers his hand to you slit again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow about you remove it, but you have to do it while I make you squirm.\u201d He rubs your clit, then inserts a finger inside you. You gasp, but accept his challenge, running your hands down his abdomen to his belt buckle. He begins to move his finger in and out, getting enough lubrication then adding another finger. You moan as he moves his fingers but continue with his buckle, unlatching it and pulling it apart. He begins to circle your clit with his thumb as he continues to pump his fingers in and out of you. You stop at the sudden flow of pleasure, grabbing onto him and clawing into his back. After taking a few deep breaths, you continue with his pants, unbuttoning them and undoing the zipper. He shifts the motion of his fingers to long and slow, making you involuntarily grind your hips for a moment, but you gain enough sanity back to push down his pants and underwear enough for his dick to spring out. You look up into his eyes and give him a sultry smirk.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI win.\u201d You wrap your hand around him begin to move your hand up and down, slowly. \u201cIn more ways than one. Very well endowed, I see\u2026\u201d You move your hand a bit faster for a moment then stop, still holding on. He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers. He then reaches to a drawer in the workbench that you didn\u2019t seem to notice, pulling out a condom.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy do you have a condom in there.\u201d You laugh, stroking his facial hair. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou never know what fun you\u2019ll catch yourself in.\u201d He opens it and slips it onto himself. \u201cThere are at least three in every drawer in here, and I change them regularly.\u201d He slips your shirt off your shoulder a bit more and pepper kisses along it. You copy his mildly satisfied face making Tony laugh and beam at you. His smile makes his eyes crinkle, and you match his loving smile with your own. He runs his hand up your thigh taking your skirt with it, lifting it to the point where your butt really touched the cold metal of the workbench. His hand finally makes its way to your lower back, pulling you closer to him. He slowly leans in and kisses you, soft but filled with passion. He pulls away and looks down to line himself up with your slit, pushing in slowly, making you whimper. He places his forehead on yours and once all the way in, he slowly pulls out, this action making you lowly gasp. He continues this motion, speeding up with each thrust, and subsequently filling the lab with louder sultry moans and groans. You reach down and rub your clit for a minute, enhancing your pleasure ten fold, but Tony reaches down and removes it, placing it back on the table. You look up at him, ecstasy and betrayal on your face and not even a second later, Tony replaces your hand with his own, rubbing your clit at varying speeds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAhhh, yes! Fuck, Mr. Stark!\u201d You throw your head back and grasp on two him, scratching his back with full knowledge and anticipation for the scars that will be left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou like that? Well, I like it when you call me Mr. Stark.\u201d He whisper and bites your shoulder, continuing to thrust and rub, the sound of his belt buckle rattling fading in with the whimpers dripping from your mouth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The room continued to be filled with moans, groans, cursing, and the occasional \u201cMr. Stark\u201d which would then be followed by another hearty groan as you two headed to your climaxes. His thrusts got faster and wilder as your grip on his back intensified. The rubbing he was doing on your clit increased in speed in reaction to him getting closer and losing all control of his body movements. In no time your reached your screaming point, grateful that you were far away from anyone that could hear you two. Tony continued to rub and thrust, reassuring you that he was close as you shook into your orgasm. Soon after he thrusted one final thrust, groaning as he came in the condom, he gradually slows his hand to stop on your clit but leaves it there for a moment longer. He lays his head on your shoulder as both of your breath heavily, trying to catch your breath, and then removes himself from you, taking the condom off and throwing it away. You can feel him smiling into your shoulder, making you smile as you lean your head on his. Suddenly there was a knock on the glass door, making you both jump. Tony quickly looks up then pulls you down to the floor from the workbench.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOw! What the fuck?!\u201d You curse, then follow Tony\u2019s gaze to the door, only peeking your head above the table. Out the door you see Steve, who was turned around and seemed to be blushing down his arms, and Nat, who simply smirked and waved at you two. You slowly turn your head to Tony to look at him with concern.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, at least we had fun.\u201d He grins, making you laugh and hit his arm.</p><p>_____</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You guys make your way up to the open living room/kitchen area where everyone seemed to be gathered, following Tony to the couch where he sat in the last available spot then pats his lap to prompt you to sit, and you do so. You wrap your arms around his neck and watch as everyone except for Clint seems to hand Nat a twenty dollar bill, which she hands half of the collection to Clint. You tilt your head at her and what for an answer for your seemingly obvious, unspoken question.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou seemed like his type.\u201d She shrugs and smiles at you, then hands you one of her twenties. You accept it with a straight face and stuff it your bra, then grin at the somber mood that fell over the room for a moment. Everyone begins to chat again and you turn your head to look at Tony, giving him one last small kiss before engaging in the conversation.</p></p>",

You now have the job of collecting intel before missions on your own now, a task you have done four times now. Along with this lengthening of your leash, you have been thrillingly sneaking around with Tony. Anywhere you guys would pass each other a kiss would be shared, the occasional make-out session would also occur, time permitting. When you would attend Avengers meetings, sultry looks would be shared between you two across the room, but dispelling any suspicion by sharing snarky remarks. Even though the familiarity of your relationship was comfortable, today seemed like a day where things would take a turn. Your heels rhythmically tap along the floor as you walk to the board room where your presence was requested. You enter the door but stay in the door frame, holding your hands in front of you. Your greeted by the eyes of Nat, Wanda, and Vision. Steve was also in the room but his focus stayed on whatever was in front of him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You summoned me?&rdquo; You smirk at Steve and slowly head towards where he is seated.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to bring this to Tony.&rdquo; Steve hands you a file then looks up, shock in his eyes for a brief moment. He quickly scanned your outfit, the sheer pink top with material that wasn&rsquo;t see-through but thin enough that flowed with the slightest of movement, the black pencil skirt the hits just above your knee and hugs your curves beautifully, and how your new bobbed twists frame your face perfectly. &ldquo;You look&hellip;different.&rdquo; You grab the file from his hand and hug it close to your chest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; You grin and turn to walk out of the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get this to Tony right away.&rdquo; You wave the file in the air as you exit the still silent room, stunned by your new display of confidence. You continue through the compound, head to the elevator and press the button for the lower level. It makes its way down and as it moves, you mess with your hair and fix the way your shirt was tucked into your skirt. The elevator stops and opens and you take a deep breath before exiting and making your way down the stairs. Once you get to the door you knock on the glass and wave when you see Tony lookup. A second later the door opens up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome, Ms. Fury.&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y greets you as you walk in. You smile at her soothing voice as you make your way over to Tony who was focusing on something at his workbench. You peck his cheek but garner no attention.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve wanted me to give you these.&rdquo; You toss the file on the workbench and work your arms around Tony&rsquo;s torso, setting your chin on his shoulder. You move your hands up to feel his chest through his shirt. &ldquo;You know, all work and no play makes Tony a dull boy.&rdquo; You trace your finger over his collarbone and kiss his earlobe, lips tracing down his neck.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working on this for three days now. I&rsquo;m on the verge of figuring it out and I hit a wall.&rdquo; Tony reaches back to your head and gently runs his hand over your twists then lean his head on yours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can distract you for a moment. Maybe relieve your mental block.&rdquo; You begin to slowly move your hands down but Tony lightly grasps your wrists and turns so he&rsquo;s facing you. He still held his grip on your wrists as he drapes your arms over his neck.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I would like that a lot, Ms. Fury.&rdquo; Tony wraps his arms around your waist to pull you into a passionate heated kiss. The level of passion that was so quickly achieved seemed almost automatic due to the number of make-out sessions that proceeded this. But this was different, this felt different. Tony&rsquo;s hands began to roam your back, one had docking on your butt and the other pulling you closer via your upper back. You two turn around so your back was now toward the workbench. Tony walks you backwards until your butt hits the workbench and, in what seemed to be unison, you jumped onto the workbench just as Tony went to lift you onto it. He separates your legs and steps forward, bringing himself closer to you, causing your skirt to move up. You two pull away for a moment to catch your breath, and you watch Tony&rsquo;s face as his eyes wander down your body. &ldquo;Are those for me?&rdquo; Tony points at your light pink thong then places his hand on your now exposed thigh.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not exactly. I wanted every part of my fit to be poppin&rsquo; today and these just so happened to be included. Your love for it is just a bonus.&rdquo; You smile and bite your lip as you run your fingers through his hair.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure that the pop factor of your outfit won&rsquo;t be affected if you lost these&hellip;&rdquo; He walks his fingers up your thigh, hooks his index finger on the waistband of your thong and pulls it down. You shift slightly in assistance then settle onto the cold workbench, the cool air of the lab hitting your pussy. He steps forward again and begins to kiss you again but push him away and smirk at him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You see, I have a policy. Piece of clothing for a piece of clothing.&rdquo; You tug at the hem of his shirt. &ldquo;Take it off.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can make this pretty sexy, you know?&rdquo; He jirates his body as he slowly pulls off his shirt, making you belly laugh. He finally pulls it off and attempts to get close to you again, but you hold your arms out so you can admire his shirtless form. He didn&rsquo;t have the typical hard chiseled abs, but the tone that graced his abdomen was just as sexy. You ran your hands over his chest hair then place your arms around his neck again, allowing him to get close to you. His steps bring him closer this time, closer than the last two moments of kissing, and begins to devour your neck, making you moan and throw your head back.

He gives you a devilish smirk and begins to move his fingers faster, realizing that he fingers were stopped the moment before that. His thumb seems to rub circles on your clit at a similar speed, earning a loud moan, but you quickly respond by jerking Tony faster. His groan is deep, almost growl like, but the way it came out showed that he was surprised at the sudden feeling of pleasure. This competition to bring each other closer to their climax continued until Tony pulls his fingers from you, making you moan from the change of feeling. He grabs your wrist and removes your hand from his dick. You look up into his eyes, biting your lip as you watch him slowly lick your taste from his fingers.

You turn around to the mirror behind you and fix your braids, defining the part by flipping braids to their corresponding sides and fixing the gold braid cuffs latched around a select few.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve should be there to greet you.

I&rsquo;m at the floor. Everything will be fine. I&rsquo;ll call you after my first day. Thank you again, by the way.&rdquo; You smile into the phone and step out the elevator then turn right towards what seems to be an opening.</p><p>&ldquo;No problem, ladybug. I know you&rsquo;ll do me proud. Love you.&rdquo; You can hear the sentiment of his words through the phone, making you smile one last time as you respond.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, too.&rdquo; You hang up your phone and place it in your purse as you continue down the hall into a lounge area that also contained a small dining table. You look around for some sign of life that was supposed to greet you, jumping and turning around when you hear a firm voice behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, if we startled you. You must be Ms. Fury.&rdquo; The blonde man smiles and sticks his hand out and you promptly shake it, then shift your gaze to the redhead that was standing to his left and holding out her hand, which you also shake. You step back and nod, giving them both polite smiles. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but you can call me Y/N. You must be Captain Rogers and Agent Romanoff. Nice to meet both of you. &rdquo; You adjust your purse on your shoulder and clasp your hands in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you too, Y/N.&rdquo; Agent Romanoff grins at you. This action seems to be to most joy she could muster up at the moment. &ldquo;I guess we should show you around.&rdquo; She chuckles then leads you to where you assume they came into the room from.</p><p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll debrief you on your duties as we walk. Welcome to the team.&rdquo; Captain Rogers pats you on the should and also gives you a warm grin.</p><p>As you walked up and down halls and take a number of elevator rides, Steve and Natasha, as they have ask you to call them, explained what you will do as an intern as well as where certain rooms are and explaining to me members that I will regularly be seeing. At this point you guys were in the elevator headed to the lower level which was where the lab was located for none other that Tony Stark. Growing up, your uncle decided that it would be best for you to not know what was going on at his job, but when he began dealing with Tony he couldn&rsquo;t help but vent about this reckless Avengers recruit. Once the elevator comes to a halt, you follow Steve and Nat out the elevator and down the flight of steps to what you can only assume to be the lab. The entrance had a window and a glass door, allowing you to see Tony pointing at machines that then promptly perform tasks. As you watch him work, Steve types in a code that open the door, letting you and Nat enter first then closely following suit. He coughs subtly to get Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cAh, Star Spangled Spandex. Who do we have here?\u201d Tony meets eyes with you and gives you a snide grin. His eyes seem to roam down your body for a moment before making eye contact again. </p><p>\u201cThis is Y/N. She\u2019s the new intern.\u201d Steve rolls his eyes then places his hand on your shoulder, shaking you a bit.</p><p>\u201cFury has good taste.\u201d Tony now blatantly leans back slightly and looking you up and down again, bring in his bottom lip slightly while smiling. Typically this behavior would have ticked you off, and sure there was a part of you right now that wanted to smack that smug grin right off his face, but the main part of you enjoyed the fact that this genius billionaire fuckboy that your Uncle despises was attracted to you. \u201cI remember when he brought me you, Natalie\u2026\u201d He stands up straight again and tilts his head toward Natasha. You look between the two as you question for a moment whether Nat\u2019s name is Natasha or Natalie.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;s not always an ass. Sometimes he&rsquo;s asleep.\u201d Steve comments, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cTony, Y/N is Fury\u2019s niece.\u201d Nat says with an even more smug grin. Tony looks back at you, shock in his eyes as a large sinister smirk grew on his face.</p><p>&quot;Hmm\u2026 Well, welcome to the team. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll enjoy every moment.&rdquo; He sticks out his hand which you lightly grab and shake. The firmness of your grasp would typically be unacceptable, but somehow it seemed fitting. You give Tony a small smile, observing his peppered facial hair and kind eyes. Your breath hitches for a moment and your heartbeat speeds up when he flashes a larger smile at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have a bit more to see so we should get going.\u201d Steve says then turns to leave, Nat following his motions. You begin to follow but stop and turn your head back to Tony.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.\u201d You give him a sweet grin. If you were able to read his mind you would\u2019ve known the shock that he felt when he heard you speak for what he realized to be the first time. The way your voice moved to his ears and how its naturally sultry sound did something to him that he wasn\u2019t used to.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, too. And please, call me Tony.\u201d He responds, crossing his arms by placing one arm over the other across his body instead of through each other.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Tony.\u201d You nod and follow behind Nat.</p><p>_____</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since you started your internship and already the work was piling up. Along with the occasional coffee and lunch runs, your main work has been to look over mission briefings and taking and analyzing data from meetings, so you\u2019ve already gotten accustomed to staying late at the compound. So much so that you have a couple of comfy shirts and pants tucked away in Nat\u2019s dresser. So there you were, cuddled up on the couch in the open living room/kitchen area underneath the fluffy blanket that you secretly kept in Steve\u2019s room, thumbing through pages of data three hours past the time you were supposed to go home for the second time this week. You were so engrossed in your work that you didn&rsquo;t hear someone enter the kitchen and open the fridge, but you did jump when you heard the fridge close. You turn to your left to see Tony smirking at you with a large pizza box on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Working late again?&rdquo; He opens the box and takes out a slice. &ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; He lift his slice towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and\u2026 sure.&rdquo; You close the file that you had and put it on the coffee table, then move a braid that didn&rsquo;t make it in your quick bun behind your ear. You stand, still wrapped in your blanket, and head to the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, there is such thing as working too hard. And I think your five steps past that. &rdquo; Tony says as you grab a plate. He places a slice on it then turns to the microwave to take his piece out, turning back to you to grab your plate and place it in the microwave.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. But it just feels natural, like I&rsquo;m supposed to do all of this.&rdquo; The microwave beeps and you take out your piece, closing the door with your head. You walk over to the fridge and grab the ranch, pouring some on your plate then putting it back. \u201cWith my uncle as the executive head of S.H.I.E.L.D, it feels like everyone expects me to be great and it gets to me. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been my entire life, trying to hard to live up to the expectations that people set for me, sometimes burning myself out\u2026\u201d You shake your head and dip your pizza in ranch then take a bite.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you doing all of this?\u201d Tony motions around you then around the couch. He picks up his pizza and takes a bite, lifting an eyebrow in anticipation for your answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working my way up. I want to make my uncle proud. Trust me, Imma be runnin this place in no time.\u201d You smirk and do an exaggerated head flip, making Tony laugh and soon after you join him.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I better stay in your good graces if your gonna be my boss one day.\u201d Tony leans on the counter and grins at you. As you look into his eyes you realize that they\u2019re the reason you didn\u2019t smack him into last week down in his lab. No matter how he acted, his eyes gave his real emotions away everytime. The way he looked at you was filled with such admiration, such wonder for how someone as wonderful as you could stroll into his life. He may act like an ass but you could tell through the way he looked at you that he would do anything for you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don&rsquo;t think you\u2019ll ever fall from my good graces.\u201d You copy his position and lean against the counter, letting a small smile grow on your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d He asks, taking a step toward you and stooping his head slightly to compensate for the two inches he has on you.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you, Tony. You\u2019re a likeable man. It\u2019s hard not to like you.\u201d You shrug and smile at him. He takes another step toward you and your chest raises as an involuntary response to his movements.</p><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t think your uncle would agree.\u201d Tony wraps his arm around you and pulls you flush against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I care.\u201d As you finish your remark, Tony brings his face towards your and you bring your face towards his in response.You raise your hands to his chest as your lips finally connect with his and begin to move in time. It started off with just your lips fighting for dominance but once the time was right Tony slips in his tongue and that fight begins. You wrap your arms around his neck as one of your hands start to run up his black and grey peppered hair. The blanket that was previously hanging on your shoulders was now on the the floor as Tony\u2019s hands roamed slowly up and down your back, every once in a while touching your butt and giving it a small squeeze, making you smile into the kiss. Eventually you both have a need to take a breath and pull away, heaving deeply for a moment then both airily laughing. Tony looks over your face for a moment longer then, lifting his hand to move your rouge braid back behind your ear.</p><p>\u201cYou should get home. Sleep in your own bed. I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.\u201d He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn\u2019t touching the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I would want to do as the greats did.\u201d You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.\u201d You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.\u201d You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning. The elevator beeps and you walk in, waving at Tony as the door closes.</p><p><a href=\"https://non-stop-imagines.tumblr.com/post/185257658676/heres-part-1-pairing-tony-stark-x\">Part 2</a></p>",

I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.\u201d He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn\u2019t touching the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I would want to do as the greats did.\u201d You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.\u201d You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.\u201d You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning. The elevator beeps and you walk in, waving at Tony as the door closes.</p><p><a href=\"https://non-stop-imagines.tumblr.com/post/185257658676/heres-part-1-pairing-tony-stark-x\">Part 2</a></p></p>",

You turn around to the mirror behind you and fix your braids, defining the part by flipping braids to their corresponding sides and fixing the gold braid cuffs latched around a select few.</p><p>\u201cSteve should be there to greet you.

I\u2019m at the floor. Everything will be fine. I\u2019ll call you after my first day. Thank you again, by the way.\u201d You smile into the phone and step out the elevator then turn right towards what seems to be an opening.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, ladybug. I know you\u2019ll do me proud. Love you.\u201d You can hear the sentiment of his words through the phone, making you smile one last time as you respond.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d You hang up your phone and place it in your purse as you continue down the hall into a lounge area that also contained a small dining table. You look around for some sign of life that was supposed to greet you, jumping and turning around when you hear a firm voice behind you.</p><p>\u201cSorry, if we startled you. You must be Ms. Fury.\u201d The blonde man smiles and sticks his hand out and you promptly shake it, then shift your gaze to the redhead that was standing to his left and holding out her hand, which you also shake. You step back and nod, giving them both polite smiles. </p><p>\u201cYes, but you can call me Y/N. You must be Captain Rogers and Agent Romanoff. Nice to meet both of you. \u201d You adjust your purse on your shoulder and clasp your hands in front of you.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too, Y/N.\u201d Agent Romanoff grins at you. This action seems to be to most joy she could muster up at the moment. \u201cI guess we should show you around.\u201d She chuckles then leads you to where you assume they came into the room from.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll debrief you on your duties as we walk. Welcome to the team.\u201d Captain Rogers pats you on the should and also gives you a warm grin.</p><p>As you walked up and down halls and take a number of elevator rides, Steve and Natasha, as they have ask you to call them, explained what you will do as an intern as well as where certain rooms are and explaining to me members that I will regularly be seeing. At this point you guys were in the elevator headed to the lower level which was where the lab was located for none other that Tony Stark. Growing up, your uncle decided that it would be best for you to not know what was going on at his job, but when he began dealing with Tony he couldn\u2019t help but vent about this reckless Avengers recruit. Once the elevator comes to a halt, you follow Steve and Nat out the elevator and down the flight of steps to what you can only assume to be the lab. The entrance had a window and a glass door, allowing you to see Tony pointing at machines that then promptly perform tasks. As you watch him work, Steve types in a code that open the door, letting you and Nat enter first then closely following suit. He coughs subtly to get Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cAh, Star Spangled Spandex. Who do we have here?\u201d Tony meets eyes with you and gives you a snide grin. His eyes seem to roam down your body for a moment before making eye contact again. </p><p>\u201cThis is Y/N. She\u2019s the new intern.\u201d Steve rolls his eyes then places his hand on your shoulder, shaking you a bit.</p><p>\u201cFury has good taste.\u201d Tony now blatantly leans back slightly and looking you up and down again, bring in his bottom lip slightly while smiling. Typically this behavior would have ticked you off, and sure there was a part of you right now that wanted to smack that smug grin right off his face, but the main part of you enjoyed the fact that this genius billionaire fuckboy that your Uncle despises was attracted to you. \u201cI remember when he brought me you, Natalie\u2026\u201d He stands up straight again and tilts his head toward Natasha. You look between the two as you question for a moment whether Nat\u2019s name is Natasha or Natalie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not always an ass. Sometimes he\u2019s asleep.\u201d Steve comments, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms.</p><p>\u201cTony, Y/N is Fury\u2019s niece.\u201d Nat says with an even more smug grin. Tony looks back at you, shock in his eyes as a large sinister smirk grew on his face.</p><p>\"Hmm\u2026 Well, welcome to the team. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy every moment.\u201d He sticks out his hand which you lightly grab and shake. The firmness of your grasp would typically be unacceptable, but somehow it seemed fitting. You give Tony a small smile, observing his peppered facial hair and kind eyes. Your breath hitches for a moment and your heartbeat speeds up when he flashes a larger smile at you.</p><p>\u201cWell, we have a bit more to see so we should get going.\u201d Steve says then turns to leave, Nat following his motions. You begin to follow but stop and turn your head back to Tony.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.\u201d You give him a sweet grin. If you were able to read his mind you would\u2019ve known the shock that he felt when he heard you speak for what he realized to be the first time. The way your voice moved to his ears and how its naturally sultry sound did something to him that he wasn\u2019t used to.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, too. And please, call me Tony.\u201d He responds, crossing his arms by placing one arm over the other across his body instead of through each other.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Tony.\u201d You nod and follow behind Nat.</p><p>_____</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since you started your internship and already the work was piling up. Along with the occasional coffee and lunch runs, your main work has been to look over mission briefings and taking and analyzing data from meetings, so you\u2019ve already gotten accustomed to staying late at the compound. So much so that you have a couple of comfy shirts and pants tucked away in Nat\u2019s dresser. So there you were, cuddled up on the couch in the open living room/kitchen area underneath the fluffy blanket that you secretly kept in Steve\u2019s room, thumbing through pages of data three hours past the time you were supposed to go home for the second time this week. You were so engrossed in your work that you didn\u2019t hear someone enter the kitchen and open the fridge, but you did jump when you heard the fridge close. You turn to your left to see Tony smirking at you with a large pizza box on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWorking late again?\u201d He opens the box and takes out a slice. \u201cPizza?\u201d He lift his slice towards you.</p><p>\u201cYes and\u2026 sure.\u201d You close the file that you had and put it on the coffee table, then move a braid that didn\u2019t make it in your quick bun behind your ear. You stand, still wrapped in your blanket, and head to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there is such thing as working too hard. And I think your five steps past that. \u201d Tony says as you grab a plate. He places a slice on it then turns to the microwave to take his piece out, turning back to you to grab your plate and place it in the microwave.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. But it just feels natural, like I\u2019m supposed to do all of this.\u201d The microwave beeps and you take out your piece, closing the door with your head. You walk over to the fridge and grab the ranch, pouring some on your plate then putting it back. \u201cWith my uncle as the executive head of S.H.I.E.L.D, it feels like everyone expects me to be great and it gets to me. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been my entire life, trying to hard to live up to the expectations that people set for me, sometimes burning myself out\u2026\u201d You shake your head and dip your pizza in ranch then take a bite.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you doing all of this?\u201d Tony motions around you then around the couch. He picks up his pizza and takes a bite, lifting an eyebrow in anticipation for your answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working my way up. I want to make my uncle proud. Trust me, Imma be runnin this place in no time.\u201d You smirk and do an exaggerated head flip, making Tony laugh and soon after you join him.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I better stay in your good graces if your gonna be my boss one day.\u201d Tony leans on the counter and grins at you. As you look into his eyes you realize that they\u2019re the reason you didn\u2019t smack him into last week down in his lab. No matter how he acted, his eyes gave his real emotions away everytime. The way he looked at you was filled with such admiration, such wonder for how someone as wonderful as you could stroll into his life. He may act like an ass but you could tell through the way he looked at you that he would do anything for you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever fall from my good graces.\u201d You copy his position and lean against the counter, letting a small smile grow on your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d He asks, taking a step toward you and stooping his head slightly to compensate for the two inches he has on you.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you, Tony. You\u2019re a likeable man. It\u2019s hard not to like you.\u201d You shrug and smile at him. He takes another step toward you and your chest raises as an involuntary response to his movements.</p><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t think your uncle would agree.\u201d Tony wraps his arm around you and pulls you flush against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I care.\u201d As you finish your remark, Tony brings his face towards your and you bring your face towards his in response.You raise your hands to his chest as your lips finally connect with his and begin to move in time. It started off with just your lips fighting for dominance but once the time was right Tony slips in his tongue and that fight begins. You wrap your arms around his neck as one of your hands start to run up his black and grey peppered hair. The blanket that was previously hanging on your shoulders was now on the the floor as Tony\u2019s hands roamed slowly up and down your back, every once in a while touching your butt and giving it a small squeeze, making you smile into the kiss. Eventually you both have a need to take a breath and pull away, heaving deeply for a moment then both airily laughing. Tony looks over your face for a moment longer then, lifting his hand to move your rouge braid back behind your ear.</p><p>\u201cYou should get home. Sleep in your own bed. I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.\u201d He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn\u2019t touching the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess I would want to do as the greats did.\u201d You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.\u201d You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.\u201d You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning.

Along with the occasional coffee and lunch runs, your main work has been to look over mission briefings and taking and analyzing data from meetings, so you&rsquo;ve already gotten accustomed to staying late at the compound. So much so that you have a couple of comfy shirts and pants tucked away in Nat&rsquo;s dresser. So there you were, cuddled up on the couch in the open living room/kitchen area underneath the fluffy blanket that you secretly kept in Steve&rsquo;s room, thumbing through pages of data three hours past the time you were supposed to go home for the second time this week. You were so engrossed in your work that you didn&rsquo;t hear someone enter the kitchen and open the fridge, but you did jump when you heard the fridge close. You turn to your left to see Tony smirking at you with a large pizza box on the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;Working late again?&rdquo; He opens the box and takes out a slice. &ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; He lift his slice towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes and&hellip; sure.&rdquo; You close the file that you had and put it on the coffee table, then move a braid that didn&rsquo;t make it in your quick bun behind your ear. You stand, still wrapped in your blanket, and head to the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, there is such thing as working too hard. And I think your five steps past that. &rdquo; Tony says as you grab a plate. He places a slice on it then turns to the microwave to take his piece out, turning back to you to grab your plate and place it in the microwave.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. But it just feels natural, like I&rsquo;m supposed to do all of this.&rdquo; The microwave beeps and you take out your piece, closing the door with your head. You walk over to the fridge and grab the ranch, pouring some on your plate then putting it back. &ldquo;With my uncle as the executive head of S.H.I.E.L.D, it feels like everyone expects me to be great and it gets to me. That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve been my entire life, trying to hard to live up to the expectations that people set for me, sometimes burning myself out&hellip;&rdquo; You shake your head and dip your pizza in ranch then take a bite.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you doing all of this?&rdquo; Tony motions around you then around the couch. He picks up his pizza and takes a bite, lifting an eyebrow in anticipation for your answer.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working my way up. I want to make my uncle proud. Trust me, Imma be runnin this place in no time.&rdquo; You smirk and do an exaggerated head flip, making Tony laugh and soon after you join him.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I guess I better stay in your good graces if your gonna be my boss one day.&rdquo; Tony leans on the counter and grins at you. As you look into his eyes you realize that they&rsquo;re the reason you didn&rsquo;t smack him into last week down in his lab. No matter how he acted, his eyes gave his real emotions away everytime. The way he looked at you was filled with such admiration, such wonder for how someone as wonderful as you could stroll into his life. He may act like an ass but you could tell through the way he looked at you that he would do anything for you.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever fall from my good graces.&rdquo; You copy his position and lean against the counter, letting a small smile grow on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo; He asks, taking a step toward you and stooping his head slightly to compensate for the two inches he has on you.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I like you, Tony. You&rsquo;re a likeable man. It&rsquo;s hard not to like you.&rdquo; You shrug and smile at him. He takes another step toward you and your chest raises as an involuntary response to his movements.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think your uncle would agree.&rdquo; Tony wraps his arm around you and pulls you flush against him.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care.&rdquo; As you finish your remark, Tony brings his face towards your and you bring your face towards his in response.You raise your hands to his chest as your lips finally connect with his and begin to move in time. It started off with just your lips fighting for dominance but once the time was right Tony slips in his tongue and that fight begins. You wrap your arms around his neck as one of your hands start to run up his black and grey peppered hair. The blanket that was previously hanging on your shoulders was now on the the floor as Tony&rsquo;s hands roamed slowly up and down your back, every once in a while touching your butt and giving it a small squeeze, making you smile into the kiss. Eventually you both have a need to take a breath and pull away, heaving deeply for a moment then both airily laughing. Tony looks over your face for a moment longer then, lifting his hand to move your rouge braid back behind your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;You should get home. Sleep in your own bed. I heard that such practices are done by all aspiring heads of superhero organizations.&rdquo; He caresses your cheek then pulls away from you, running his fingers along your sides then fully pulling away to, first, hand you your blanket, then, moving around you, to put the pizza box back into the fridge. The loss of contact saddens your mood slightly but you soon begin to clean too, throwing away the plates that you two used then rolling up your blanket so it wasn&rsquo;t touching the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I guess I would want to do as the greats did.&rdquo; You head over to the coffee table and gather up the file that was thrown on top.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need a ride home? I can get Happy to drive you.&rdquo; You hug your items tight to your chest as Tony struts to you then runs his fingers along your hip.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Happy would be very happy with me if you called him at midnight. I can get a cab.&rdquo; You step closer to him, craving the touch of his lips on yours one last time. You partially get your wish, receiving a quick, parting kiss from Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow.&rdquo; He backs his upper body away so he can get a better look at your face.</p><p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow.&rdquo; You respond then leave his grip. You turn and move toward the elevator, pressing the button then turning your head back to him and grinning. The elevator beeps and you walk in, waving at Tony as the door closes.</p><p><a href=\"https://non-stop-imagines.tumblr.com/post/185257658676/heres-part-1-pairing-tony-stark-x\">Part 2</a></p></p>",
