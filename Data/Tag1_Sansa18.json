Normally Theon likes being in her company, but this time he just wants this visit to be over. Because the sooner prince Joffrey is gone again, the sooner Sansa will realise that her true love and handsome knight has always be there.</small></p><p><small><i>*This will probably be Theon dreaming about marrying Sansa for a long time, but I promise, he will get noticed at some point!*</i></small></p></blockquote><p>\u201cWho plans a hunting trip the day after a feast?\u201d Theon tightly held onto the reigns of his horse. He still felt slightly unbalanced and a piercing headache was splitting his skull into two, but when his Lord and the King had asked him to accompany them, Robb and most of their men on this trip he had not really known how to say no. \u201cIt\u2019s a day to spend in bed in the company of a pretty lady!\u201d He raised his voice. </p><p>Robb shook his head and chuckled. \u201cAs if the lady you\u2019ve set your eyes on would have joined you in that bed of yours.\u201d </p><p>Theon felt his cheeks heating up and he licked his dry lips. \u201cA guy can dream, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019ve been doing all those times you\u2019ve been telling me about those great adventures and nights you\u2019ve had?\u201d Robb raised his eyebrows. \u201cOr are you the kinda guy who\u2019s in love with one girl, but doesn\u2019t mind satisfying his needs with the body of another?\u201d</p><p>Theon took a deep breath. \u201cIs this the part where you\u2019re gonna tell me that I\u2019m not good enough for your sister?\u201d Theon turned his face towards his best friend. \u201cYou already made that clear. She will marry a King. I can\u2019t compete with a King.\u201d He dropped his shoulders and his horse slowed down. \u201cDoes it change anything if I say that every time I\u2019ve been with another girl I dreamed she was your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Robb furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cI think it only makes it worse.\u201d He had a playful smile around his lips though and slowly the caravan of hunters, on their way home already now the sun was setting, rode away from them. \u201cAnd yet\u2026\u201d Robb paused for a long and agonising moment.</p><!-- more --><p>Technically Theon was their hostage, a price his father had to pay for his role in the rebellion and the side he chose at the time. But the Starks had never made Theon feel like a hostage. But sometimes, in the middle of the night or when one of the Starks started a sentence and took a very long time to finish, Theon feared they all of a sudden remembered again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be good to her, I just know that.\u201d Robb continued and Theon let out the breath he was holding, all of a sudden feeling a few pounds lighter once more. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about prince Joffrey.\u201d Robb forced his horse to stop and carefully he checked if none of the King\u2019s soldiers had stayed behind to overhear their conversation. \u201cAnd you know my sister just as well as I do. She is naive and in her mind all princes are charming and brave and perfect.\u201d </p><p>It was one of Sansa\u2019s most beautiful flaws. Even in this world, consumed by greed and a hunger for power, where every time someone ended up on the throne others already plotted to bring them down again, she only saw goodness. When she thought about war, she didn\u2019t think about the killing and the screaming and the smell of burning fires. She thought about all the heroes saving the poor damsels in distress before anything bad could happen to them. </p><p>\u201cFather wants to take her, Bran and Arya to King\u2019s Landing.\u201d Robb continued talking as if he hadn\u2019t noticed that Theon\u2019s mind had drifted off.</p><p>\u201cKing\u2019s Landing?\u201d Theon widened his eyes. \u201cWere you just saying that your father is really planning on taking them South?\u201d He shook his head in disbelief. </p><p>Ned couldn\u2019t do that. He wasn\u2019t allowed to do that. </p><p>Theon had it all figured out last night. Joffrey would leave Winterfell again, his hand promised to Sansa once she was of age and old enough to get married. After a while Sansa would stop dreaming about the prince, who would by then be nothing but a fading memory. And prince Joffrey would meet another maiden, not as pretty as Sansa, but just pretty enough and maybe from a more important family. King Robbert would forget about the engagement, a plan he had made hastily just so he could convince Ned to become his hand. And when Sansa would hear about the wedding, Theon would be there to comfort her and she would notice that she had actually stopped caring about the crown prince and that the prince of the Iron Islands was who she really wanted.</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d </p><p>Theon\u2019s daydream shattered and the million pieces exploded before he could gather them again to glue them together. \u201cHe can\u2019t do that. They should stay with their mother, here in Winterfell. The South is no place for a Stark.\u201d Everyone knew that. Even Theon knew that and he wasn\u2019t even a Stark.</p><p>Robb\u2019s lips were forming a straight line and he narrowed his eyes. \u201cFather thinks Sansa might actually like it. She has always loved music and stories and feasts. Winterfell is not quite as alive as King\u2019s Landing. She might not even want to come back home once she has tasted what the capital has to offer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have to stop him from taking her.\u201d Theon\u2019s voice sounded slightly higher than usual and every word trembled. \u201cWhat if she gets hurt or even worse, what if something happens to her father and she\u2019s all alone, far away from home?\u201d</p><p>Robb\u2019s glance met his and then Robb curled his lips up into a smile. \u201cYou really love her, do you?\u201d He cocked his head and stared at his best friend. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d He planted his heels in his horse\u2019s flanks and Theon did the same.</p><p>Quickly they caught up with the hunting party, but when they rode through the gates of Winterfell they found the courtyard completely empty and the deafening howling of the dire wolves sang in their ears.</p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d Sansa rushed out of the castle. Loose strands of red hair were dangling from her braids. Her eyes were red and swollen and traces of her tears were visible on her cheeks. \u201cFather, you have to come quickly. Bran fell off of the old tower while climbing and the Maester isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019ll ever wake up again.\u201d </p><p>Not only Ned jumped off of his horse as quickly as possible.

He still felt slightly unbalanced and a piercing headache was splitting his skull into two, but when his Lord and the King had asked him to accompany them, Robb and most of their men on this trip he had not really known how to say no. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a day to spend in bed in the company of a pretty lady!&rdquo; He raised his voice. </p><p>Robb shook his head and chuckled. &ldquo;As if the lady you&rsquo;ve set your eyes on would have joined you in that bed of yours.&rdquo; </p><p>Theon felt his cheeks heating up and he licked his dry lips. &ldquo;A guy can dream, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what you&rsquo;ve been doing all those times you&rsquo;ve been telling me about those great adventures and nights you&rsquo;ve had?&rdquo; Robb raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Or are you the kinda guy who&rsquo;s in love with one girl, but doesn&rsquo;t mind satisfying his needs with the body of another?&rdquo;</p><p>Theon took a deep breath. &ldquo;Is this the part where you&rsquo;re gonna tell me that I&rsquo;m not good enough for your sister?&rdquo; Theon turned his face towards his best friend. &ldquo;You already made that clear. She will marry a King. I can&rsquo;t compete with a King.&rdquo; He dropped his shoulders and his horse slowed down. &ldquo;Does it change anything if I say that every time I&rsquo;ve been with another girl I dreamed she was your sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo; Robb furrowed his eyebrows. &ldquo;I think it only makes it worse.&rdquo; He had a playful smile around his lips though and slowly the caravan of hunters, on their way home already now the sun was setting, rode away from them. &ldquo;And yet&hellip;&rdquo; Robb paused for a long and agonising moment.</p><p>Technically Theon was their hostage, a price his father had to pay for his role in the rebellion and the side he chose at the time. But the Starks had never made Theon feel like a hostage. But sometimes, in the middle of the night or when one of the Starks started a sentence and took a very long time to finish, Theon feared they all of a sudden remembered again.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be good to her, I just know that.&rdquo; Robb continued and Theon let out the breath he was holding, all of a sudden feeling a few pounds lighter once more. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about prince Joffrey.&rdquo; Robb forced his horse to stop and carefully he checked if none of the King&rsquo;s soldiers had stayed behind to overhear their conversation. &ldquo;And you know my sister just as well as I do. She is naive and in her mind all princes are charming and brave and perfect.&rdquo; </p><p>It was one of Sansa&rsquo;s most beautiful flaws. Even in this world, consumed by greed and a hunger for power, where every time someone ended up on the throne others already plotted to bring them down again, she only saw goodness. When she thought about war, she didn&rsquo;t think about the killing and the screaming and the smell of burning fires. She thought about all the heroes saving the poor damsels in distress before anything bad could happen to them. </p><p>&ldquo;Father wants to take her, Bran and Arya to King&rsquo;s Landing.&rdquo; Robb continued talking as if he hadn&rsquo;t noticed that Theon&rsquo;s mind had drifted off.</p><p>&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Landing?&rdquo; Theon widened his eyes. &ldquo;Were you just saying that your father is really planning on taking them South?&rdquo; He shook his head in disbelief. </p><p>Ned couldn&rsquo;t do that. He wasn&rsquo;t allowed to do that. </p><p>Theon had it all figured out last night. Joffrey would leave Winterfell again, his hand promised to Sansa once she was of age and old enough to get married. After a while Sansa would stop dreaming about the prince, who would by then be nothing but a fading memory. And prince Joffrey would meet another maiden, not as pretty as Sansa, but just pretty enough and maybe from a more important family. King Robbert would forget about the engagement, a plan he had made hastily just so he could convince Ned to become his hand. And when Sansa would hear about the wedding, Theon would be there to comfort her and she would notice that she had actually stopped caring about the crown prince and that the prince of the Iron Islands was who she really wanted.</p><p>&ldquo;He is.&rdquo; </p><p>Theon&rsquo;s daydream shattered and the million pieces exploded before he could gather them again to glue them together. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do that. They should stay with their mother, here in Winterfell. The South is no place for a Stark.&rdquo; Everyone knew that. Even Theon knew that and he wasn&rsquo;t even a Stark.</p><p>Robb&rsquo;s lips were forming a straight line and he narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;Father thinks Sansa might actually like it. She has always loved music and stories and feasts. Winterfell is not quite as alive as King&rsquo;s Landing. She might not even want to come back home once she has tasted what the capital has to offer.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You have to stop him from taking her.&rdquo; Theon&rsquo;s voice sounded slightly higher than usual and every word trembled. &ldquo;What if she gets hurt or even worse, what if something happens to her father and she&rsquo;s all alone, far away from home?&rdquo;</p><p>Robb&rsquo;s glance met his and then Robb curled his lips up into a smile. &ldquo;You really love her, do you?&rdquo; He cocked his head and stared at his best friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo; He planted his heels in his horse&rsquo;s flanks and Theon did the same.</p><p>Quickly they caught up with the hunting party, but when they rode through the gates of Winterfell they found the courtyard completely empty and the deafening howling of the dire wolves sang in their ears.</p><p>&ldquo;Father?&rdquo; Sansa rushed out of the castle. Loose strands of red hair were dangling from her braids. Her eyes were red and swollen and traces of her tears were visible on her cheeks. &ldquo;Father, you have to come quickly. Bran fell off of the old tower while climbing and the Maester isn&rsquo;t sure if he&rsquo;ll ever wake up again.&rdquo; </p><p>Not only Ned jumped off of his horse as quickly as possible. Theon and Robb did so too.</p><p>&ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo; While Robb and Ned rushed past Sansa, Theon stood still next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Sansa sniffed and then she turned around to follow her father and brother. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want him to die!&rdquo;</p><p>Theon hesitantly wrapped an arm around her shaking shoulders. &ldquo;Your brother is a Stark.
