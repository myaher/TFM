I\u2019m studying it for school and it\u2019s got lots of angst potential - it causes severe, seizure like muscle spasms which can break the patient\u2019s bones, but they\u2019re conscious and fully aware of what\u2019s happening. It also causes fever and lockjaw, and difficulty breathing. Patients often develop pneumonia afterwards too. I\u2019d love to see an angst fic where Peter has bad tetanus and Tony and co are looking after him whilst his symptoms get worse and worse",
        "answer": "<p>THIS PROMPT TOOK OVER MY LIFE BUT I LOVE YOU FOR IT!!!! Thank you sm!!!</p><p>(I am sO very much not a doctor in any way so please pretend I know what I\u2019m talking about and that this is actually convincing!)</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15674718\">this fic on ao3</a></p><hr><p>Driving long distances wasn\u2019t really Tony\u2019s thing. </p><p>Being a man of ample wealth \u2013 not to mention a distinct lack of affinity with \u2018scenic routes\u2019 comprised entirely of cornfields \u2013 \u00a0made it a pretty basic principal: when a private jet is an option, you don\u2019t say no.</p><p>That, and the fact that he\u2019s pretty sure he has some nice internalised trauma in the back somewhere from his parents dying in a car, or something. Shut up. Whatever. Road trips weren\u2019t his thing.</p><p>Go figure. <br/><br/>So to say he was surprised to find himself openly offering to cart one Peter Parker to <i>California </i>and back? That would be an understatement. </p><p>45 hours of driving. Both ways. 90 hours.</p><p>Oh, what the hell. Was he really that surprised? He loves the kid. </p><!-- more --><p>Peter wasn\u2019t going to college for another couple years, but the kid could\u2019ve been there a long time ago. It was only natural that he was interested in the top universities the country had to offer; Stanford and Berkeley being right up there, and easily within his academic sights.</p><p>Tony had somehow managed to get May\u2019s pride complex to share a room with his desire to sponsor Peter a full ride. She\u2019d heard him out, and the whole time he was speaking, he could see the conflict on her face.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want charity. Even the implication of it made her squirm.</p><p>But she loved Peter, and she wanted him to achieve his full potential. Though her and Ben had accepted the fact a long time ago, it was still awful that they had to mortgage what felt like everything, from the roof over their head to the air in their lungs, to nurture Peter\u2019s gifts. </p><p>And here was Tony, offering him everything he deserved and more. It wouldn\u2019t make even a dent in Tony\u2019s bank balance, and it was clear he was offering out of love and care for her nephew, and nothing else. No ulterior motive, no sleazy need to sedate a guilty conscience.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t seen Peter trying to hide the Stanford prospectus under his hamper, the Yale webpage that was hastily closed when she walked past.</p><p>So she said yes. </p><p>And Peter was really grateful, and<i> really</i> happy. </p><p>They\u2019d been in the lab, working on something or other \u2013 web fluid and shooters, maybe \u2013 and Peter had been talking about California. Stanford, specifically. And how May was stressing about booking time off for an open day. </p><p>\u201cI could take you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t worry about it Mr Stark, it\u2019s cool! She\u2019ll just have to do some make-up graveyard shifts, and I was gonna help out by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFRI, compare the open day dates. Am I free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Ms Potts are in Stockholm between the 5th July and 17th August. The visitor centre isn\u2019t open outside of those dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no dice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dice, Boss.\u201d</p><p>Though Peter had politely rejected the idea, Tony could\u2019ve sworn his face fell just a little. He cleared his throat and threw a grape into his mouth, leaning back in his chair and considering. </p><p>After a minute or so of the kid side-eyeing him from his bubbling formula, he threw a grape at Peter\u2019s head to get his attention, then stared off into space innocently, pretending he hadn\u2019t thrown it. </p><p>\u201cThey know me at Stanford. I\u2019ve got sway. <i>And</i> Berkeley, I think.\u201d He shrugged, pointing at the ceiling. \u201cHit me with it, FRIDAY.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got honorary alumni status at both, Boss.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned at Peter like all his problems were solved. \u201cReally! <i>Aces</i>.\u201d </p><p>Peter narrowed his eyes. \u201cMr Stark, I\u2026 you know how thankful I am to you for funding me this scholarship, and all, and I am! Really. It\u2019s\u2026 it means so much to me. And May. But I can\u2019t just ask you to fly me out there on top of everything else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about flying? Are you putting words in my mouth again, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019ve never put\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a pain in the neck! We could make it a fun little road trip - take the Audi. I know it\u2019s your favourite. Stop at a hotel, do some sightseeing. You\u2019ve never been to San Francisco, you can be a disgusting tourist!\u201d Peter crossed his arms and rolled his eyes, not even trying to conceal his smile. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be fun! It\u2019d be a week, tops. And I can make up for being in Sweden for most of your summer.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled at him softly. \u201c<i>Usually</i> it\u2019s the kid begging the adult to let them do something crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, whoa there. Foolish, perhaps. Eccentric, possibly. But crazy? You\u2019re toeing the line, there, kid.\u201d He stood and moved to Peter\u2019s workstation, flopping into his chair and pouting dramatically. \u201cCome oooon. You never do anything fun with me.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cMr <i>Stark</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony stuck his bottom lip out further and stirred the web fluid concoction sadly. \u201cNever wants to spend time with me.\u201d He muttered. \u201cAlways with Ned. Never with Mr Stark.\u201d He sighed, slumping his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Peter laughed. \u201cFine! We can go.\u201d </p><p>They both knew he\u2019d been in from the second Tony had suggested it.</p><hr><p><i>whoa dude im so jealous!!!! Facetime me when youre at the hotel and tell me about it!!</i><br/></p><p>Tony smirks to himself as he brings his eyes back to the road. That was Ned\u2019s reply to Peter\u2019s earlier text of, \u2018<i>best trip ever!!!!\u2019</i>, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel just a little bit smug about it.</p><p>He\u2019s feeling more sad than smug, though. He and Peter\u2019d had a really fun time, and he\u2019s a little disappointed it\u2019s over so soon. They\u2019d had pretty much unprecedented tours of Berkeley and Stanford, which Peter had loved (though he didn\u2019t envy Peter of the future, having to pick one of all these colleges that\u2019d have him at the drop of a hat). </p><p>Then they\u2019d had a couple days just here and there, sightseeing and relaxing and eating good food, staying in a nice hotel in San Francisco that made Peter bounce on the balls of his feet in excitement at the luxury.\u00a0</p><p>Tony received a selfie off him in his bath tub, up to the eyeballs in bubbles and a champagne flute of orange juice in his hand.</p><p>A squirrel had tried to basically mug Peter of his pretzels in Golden Gate Park. Tony couldn\u2019t with 100% certainty guarantee that May hadn\u2019t been immediately sent a perfectly timed photo of the attack, or that she wasn\u2019t framing multiple copies at that very moment. God, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d laughed so hard.</p><p>Chuckling under his breath at the memory, he looks over at the kid, who\u2019s fast asleep beside him. His smile turns at the corners into a grimace when he sees the position Peter\u2019s in \u2013 slumped forward, his neck at a weird angle. </p><p>Peter had mentioned yesterday that his neck and jaw had been a bit stiff and sore. Tony had joked that he was probably sleeping on the ceiling <i>just because he could</i>, and that was why his neck was playing up.\u00a0</p><p>Peter had laughed, said something about taking a hit on patrol. From then on, Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice every time Peter rubbed his mouth or winced slightly at a movement, and had resolved to take the suit in for upgrades; starting with more head and neck support.<br/></p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been bothering him too much, if the vigour with which he took up the role of slack-jawed tourist was anything to go by.</p><p>Well, at least he didn\u2019t have to worry about <i>why</i> the kid\u2019s healing factor wasn\u2019t fixing up the injury \u2013 sleep like <i>that</i> and it was no wonder his neck was all strained.\u00a0</p><p>He looks like some kind of creepy contortionist, head flopped forward and twisted towards the window. He\u2019s only restrained by the seatbelt \u2013 otherwise he\u2019d be faceplanting the dash for sure. </p><p>Boy, was he out of it. Had he maybe overdone it with the touristy things?</p><p><i>Nah. </i></p><p>Kid loved it. </p><p>\u201cSomeone gets you in one spot for longer than 30 seconds one time and you pull a Sleeping Beauty.\u201d He softly grouses. Peter\u2019s knowledge of good health habits \u2013 namely that you <i>actually have to sleep every once in a blue moon</i> \u2013 is shockingly poor for a kid genius. He focuses back on the road for a split second before his head whips back. \u201cI only called you Beauty to get the reference right. It\u2019s not a compliment. Don\u2019t get cocky.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t stir. Tony sighs, leaning over to push him back against the seat with one hand against his chest. Once he\u2019s there and the seatbelt is more lax, he tries to ease his head back a little, withdrawing suddenly, fingers curling at the surprise heat he finds on Peter\u2019s brow. </p><p>He coughs under his breath, confusion spreading under his features. He corrects the car\u2019s course an inch to the left, thankful they\u2019re on a straight, almost empty highway, and presses his entire hand to Peter\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201c<i>El scorchio.</i> Peter? Hey, Parker, rise and shine.\u201d He shakes Peter\u2019s shoulder whilst staring at the road, awkwardness now for some reason filling up inside him. </p><p>Peter grunts. \u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up.\u201d He exhales long and slow out of his nose and rubs his eyes and neck, hissing at the latter like Tony had expected him to.</p><p>He squeezes one eye shut and twists his features to the left as he pointlessly tries to inspect his neck. He must agitate his sore jaw doing this, because he hisses again. Tony stares ahead at the road. </p><p>\u201cAw man. I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep. Sorry, Mr Stark.\u201d He says. \u201cAre we stopping or didja just miss me?\u201d He taunts.</p><p>Tony plays with words in his mouth. Peter sounds okay, has enough in him to make fun\u2026</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d do a number on your neck if I let you sleep like that any longer. I\u2019m sure your aunt would have a thing or two to say about that. You alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad.\u201d</p><p><i>Sure. And since we\u2019re playing make-believe, I\u2019m late for my date with the Tooth Fairy, so if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026</i></p><p>Peter pulls his hoodie off. He balls it up and hugs it to him, his socked feet up on the seat. Tony makes a cursory glance at him, and catches his eye. He smiles. Peter smiles back \u2013 his eyes are tired. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop in about half an hour. You can go back to sleep if you want, I\u2019m fine with the radio.\u201d</p><p>Peter turns on the radio. \u201cNah. I\u2019ve left you on your own \u2013 which, by the way, Ms Potts told me <i>never</i> to do \u2013 for like, half an hour already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I know y\u2014<i>two hours</i>?\u201d</p><p>Tony snorts and nods. \u201cAaa<i>yup</i>. Did an excellent corpse impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr <i>Stark</i>!\u201d Peter whines, cracking his window open and sticking his fingers out. \u201cYou shoulda woke me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, think you\u2019ll find I <i>did</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m nothing if not a generous man.\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t rebut the statement, and Tony promptly files it away under <i>Jokes That Fall Flat Because The Kid Still Thinks I\u2019m a Good Person</i>. \u201cAnd I thought I\u2019d better leave you to your fever-\u201c he shoots him a wilting look, \u201cand all. But yeah, you know, it\u2019s chill. It\u2019s cool. Well, you\u2019re not chill or cool. Because of the fever. Hey, look at that! I made a funny.\u201d</p><p>Peter is glaring at him, but with no heat behind it. \u201cI get warm when I sleep, and I had this on.\u201d He gestures to the hoodie. Tony sighs.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Mr Stark, I feel fine.\u201d</p><p>Tony relents. \u201cYou wanna put one of your playlists on?\u201d</p><p>Peter grins. </p><hr><p>They stop for food. Peter gets a grilled cheese and strawberry milkshake. Tony watches him with reserved concern whenever he\u2019s not looking. </p><p>The kid\u2019s still bubbly and happy and warm - still <i>warm</i> warm, too. Tony sneakily checked by messing up Peter\u2019s hair like he hates him doing \u2013 but he is a little quieter.</p><p>He definitely doesn\u2019t inhale his food like he normally does, or order seconds like he normally does, and when Tony orders <i>himself</i> seconds, he excuses himself to the bathroom.</p><p>Tony eats the onion rings first in the couple minutes he\u2019s gone. He has his suspicions that the strong smell wasn\u2019t agreeing with the kid.</p><p>And, as always, his jaw\u2019s bothering him. Neck, too. </p><p>Watching him eat with exaggerated care and obvious pain is driving Tony\u2019s blood pressure through the damn roof.</p><p>They\u2019re back on the road now, have been for about 4 hours. </p><p>Tony listens to the classical station on low volume, the local news on medium, the rock station on almost mute. He ends up shutting it all off.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t plan on stopping till 2 or 3am; however long it takes to get to their hotel checkpoint. It just makes sense to drive till late, when it\u2019s quiet, then sleep in to miss the early morning traffic, have a late breakfast and do the same again. </p><p>He\u2019ll stop if Peter asks, but otherwise, he\u2019s good. </p><p>The quiet \u2013 Peter\u2019s obviously out cold once again \u2013 is actually nice. It\u2019s not heavy and oppressive, like he can find quiet to be. It\u2019s just steady. He\u2019s thinking about things without feeling overwhelmed. He can just drive and think and think and drive.</p><p>And keep an eye on the kid. </p><p>He shifts in his sleep, head now pillowed against the window with Tony\u2019s jacket, and hoodie still bunched up in his arms, hugged to his waist.</p><p>It\u2019s only 9pm right now, and he\u2019s wondering whether to push it till 10:30 or maybe 11. Six hours is a long time to drive non-stop, but he\u2019s not really hungry from his huge lunch, and he doesn\u2019t need the bathroom. </p><p>It all depends on Peter. If he stays asleep, he guesses he could just keep driving. </p><p>He\u2019s only a couple minutes into that resolution when Peter does wake. </p><p>\u201cEvening.\u201d He says softly. \u201cHow d\u2019you feel?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flutter shut again and he offers only a small smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d He doesn\u2019t move. Tony\u2019s too smart to know it\u2019s not because the position is too comfortable to relinquish. </p><p>He knows it\u2019s because any movement will jar and pain him. </p><p>He\u2019d offer him painkillers, but the kid\u2019s already refused them twice today. God, what can he do? Maybe he should take him on a spa day or something.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Pete. I wasn\u2019t gonna stop for a little while, but we can if you need to.\u201d </p><p>Peter flaps a hand at him. \u201cI\u2019m good. Maybe in, like, an hour?\u201d </p><p>Tony nods. \u201cSure thing. Hey, I was thinking. D\u2019you think you\u2019ve got a bad case of whiplash or something? Because you\u2019re flipping around Queens all day and I haven\u2019t put all that much reinforcement in the neck of the suit.\u201d</p><p>Peter eyes him and what looks like relief floods his features. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah? Gimme the suit when we\u2019re back. I\u2019ll work on that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf <i>course.</i> You think I\u2019m gonna let you let me do all the work for you?\u201d </p><p>Peter breathes out a laugh that turns into a more forced exhale when he moves to sit up straight. He leans forward tentatively, head in his hands. Tony\u2019s jacket slips down from the window into his lap and he digs a hand into it.</p><p>Tony balks. He can\u2019t reach for him, the road around them is busy. \u201cHey, hey, hey. Easy. What\u2019s wrong, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019okay. Just got sorta dizzy.\u201d Peter says, not moving from his position. \u201cI thought\u2014it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d Tony pulls up into gravel of the shoulder as gently as possible. He undoes both his and Peter\u2019s seatbelts. </p><p>He hesitates over what to do now he has his hands free and settles on rubbing a hand up and down Peter\u2019s lower back. \u201cStay like that if it helps, Peter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThought I might pass out.\u201d </p><p>Tony feels Peter\u2019s cheek with the back of his hand. It\u2019s clammy. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Mr Stark. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He murmurs. \u201cJust a headache. Not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I was asleep for too long?\u201d Tony doesn\u2019t fail to notice that Peter\u2019s voice is a little bit croaky. \u201cIn one position.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s insides twist. That isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>Peter breathes. Tony looks up the nearest hotel, motel, truck stop, anything, and finds a motel a couple miles down the road. Peter tries to argue against it, so Tony just lies and says he\u2019s tired too.</p><p>The guy at the desk is nice. He\u2019s a huge, broad guy, with an impressive dark beard that Tony compliments the second he enters the reception. </p><p>He apologises profusely that they only have one room free, and it\u2019s a king. Tony insists it\u2019s fine. He wouldn\u2019t care if it were a shack that was $1,000,000/h: as long as it was clean and Peter got to lie down, he couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Peter, poor kid, must have held a similar kind of ethics for the situation, since he only argued with Tony for 5 minutes about who got the bed (\u201c<i>But Mr Stark, you\u2019re driving. And paying. You\u2019re already stopping for me. I like sleeping on couches.</i>\u201d \u201c<i>Not a chance in absolute hell, kid. Here\u2019s your pyjamas.\u201d</i>) before he fell into it face first and dead to the world.</p><p>The motel wasn\u2019t bad. It wasn\u2019t anything like the place Tony had originally booked for tonight, but it wasn\u2019t grimy or falling apart at the seams either. </p><p>It has clean sheets, a hot shower, a decent coffee machine, and a separate light for the kitchenette that means Tony can keep the room dim but still get some work done at the table. </p><p>He sits back and stares at the papers. This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d expected to spend his evening. To be fair to Pepper \u2013 and he rarely was \u2013 she\u2019d be ecstatic that he was finally getting down to some business.</p><p>But, if he was <i>totally</i> honest, he\u2019d been looking forward to a repeat of the journey here: he and Peter\u2019d had a fun time. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fault. The kid probably already felt guilty for the fact that he\u2019d altered their plans \u2013 even if he couldn\u2019t help it. </p><p>He resolves to make<i> sure </i>Peter knew he wasn\u2019t mad at him when he was feeling better. He hopes that\u2019d be tomorrow morning, what with Peter\u2019s healing factor. He had to admit that although they didn\u2019t spend every waking moment together, he\u2019d never seen Peter sick. It made him more than a little uncomfortable.</p><p><i>Oh well</i>. He picks up his pen and sighs. <i>No time like the present.</i></p><hr><p>He eventually goes to the couch and gets a few hours shuteye. He sleeps till 3:45am, which isn\u2019t too bad, all things considered. It\u2019s about the limit of what he can get right now, what with the nightmares and the insomnia. </p><p>And a distinct lack of Pepper by his side.</p><p>Heaving himself up, he flips on the small lamp by the couch. Peter\u2019s still out of it, but his face has less lines than before. </p><p>Tony smiles. The kid\u2019s face has definitely regained more colour. </p><p>He picks up discarded items of clothing as he heads for the coffeemaker, folding them and placing them back on top of Peter\u2019s bag. As he drops them down, he notices the kid\u2019s phone screen light up at him. It\u2019s on 12%, and Tony\u2019s has a pet peeve for low batteries. He plugs it in on the nightstand and flips it onto silent.</p><p>Sitting back at the table, he mulls over the situation. </p><p>For starters, he\u2019s never seen Peter willingly sleep so much. He must be feeling really crappy to have slept for\u2026 what? It\u2019s gotta be <i>well </i>over 12 hours now. </p><p>For what Tony liked to call \u201cseconders\u201d (to piss Rhodey off), he had to admit to his paranoid, panicking brain that \u201cwillingly\u201d was the operative word when he\u2019d said he\u2019d never seen Peter sleep that much. He <i>had </i>seen Peter sleep that much.</p><p>It just\u2026 wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 with his consent? </p><p>The handful of times he\u2019d been injured as Spider-Man, his healing factor had forced him to sort of\u2026 hibernate so it could focus on repairing his body. Tony hoped to god that it was what was happening here.</p><p>For nexters, although the seconders answered one question, it raised another: if it was his enhanced healing, why wasn\u2019t it patching up his neck?</p><p>He would\u2019ve gone for a home run with <i>for lasters</i>, but he\u2019d been sitting and staring at the kid for so long, and the kid had been dead still the entire time. Which, for Peter Parker, sleeptalker extraordinaire, was weird. <i>Weird.</i></p><p>Peter was an active sleeper, to say the least. He was almost as hyper in sleep as he was awake (which embarrassed him to no end). He was always talking, laughing \u2013 which was <i>super</i> creepy, can he just say for the record \u2013 tossing and turning and ending up at the other end of the bed, or even slipping off the couch if there wasn\u2019t someone there to nudge him back on. Kid could sleep through a hurricane if it weren\u2019t for his Spidey sense.</p><p>But now\u2026 now Peter\u2019s in the centre of the bed, the <i>hogger,</i> comforter wrapped tight around his neck, and silent. When Tony comes closer, he sees that the kid\u2019s sweating. </p><p>He groans under his breath. </p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d he says, only half-hoping he\u2019d wake until he feels the same warmth amidst Peter\u2019s curls. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>Peter stirs lethargically. He goes to turn his head towards Tony, eyes closed, but they squint further shut in pain when his neck protests. \u201cHey, time s\u2019it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLate.\u201d Tony answers honestly, softly. </p><p>He feels awkward standing by the kid\u2019s bedside, but now he\u2019s up close, he\u2019s bordering dangerously on concern for Peter\u2019s wax-candle paleness and body temperature. \u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter is a terrible liar - <i>especially</i> when bleary from sleep. Tony knows this before he even speaks, from the convulsive swallow and the soft, surprised gasp of pain that follows it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, man, I\u2019m good. We leaving? I can just\u2014\u201d he swallows again and <i>does this kid really think I\u2019m not seeing this?</i> and rubs at his neck, \u201c\u2014can just grab a quick shower and I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He begins coordinating his limbs into movement. Tony holds him down by his shoulder, and Peter squeaks a protesting <i>hey!</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. You\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d Peter croaks, eyes already starting to slip shut again. \u201cI jus\u2019 woke up. Gimme a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-<i>huh</i>.\u201d He turns towards the kitchen and fills a glass of water, making sure it\u2019s cool but not ice-cold.</p><p>Peter watches him with an adorable suspicion that Tony pretends not to notice, and one eye cracked open.</p><p>\u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete.\u201d He cuts in, although gently. \u201cI\u2019m a hair\u2019s width from asking Hagrid at reception for a thermometer.\u201d Peter smiles slightly at the reference. He accepts the glass. \u201cGood call, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Whilst he drinks, Tony turns away again and heads to the couch, where he flips open his duffel and unzips the back pocket. </p><p>He rummages around, humming an <i>ah-ha!</i> as he pulls out some painkillers and shakes the pot by his ear. He grimaces when he hears what could only be a couple pills rattling around inside.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t be enough for him.</p><p>He went back to Peter, who was struggling back the water. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d He takes the glass off him and sets it aside. Peter looks relieved. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough meds for a superkid right now. D\u2019you want me to run to the store,\u201d<i> which is probably 20 miles away,</i> \u201cand grab some? And you\u2019ve got to be honest with me here. Seriously. I know your neck\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, it\u2019s fine, Mr Stark, honestly! I\u2019m fine. Store\u2019s probably like thirty miles away anyway. I\u2019ve had worse. Just needs sleeping off.\u201d Peter rushes to reassure, his voice thin and wispy.</p><p>Tony hesitates. \u201cOkay.\u201d He murmurs. \u201cYou know, you look like shit, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what all the girls say.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t quite believe that, somehow.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiles back. \u201cWe\u2019re not all womanizers like you, Mr Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow very dare you. I\u2019ll tell Miss Potts that when I see her, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Peter smirks. Long gone were the days when he was nervous of Pepper, and anxious to please - the days when Tony\u2019s joking threats like that were taken as gospel. </p><p>He inhales deeply, as though about to yawn, and Tony takes that as his cue to move away back to his makeshift office, when Peter yelps in shock. He shifts back around to see the kid with his mouth hanging half open, hands probing his jaw desperately.</p><p>He\u2019d have made a joke about the wind changing if he had a little less tact.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d He comes to sit on the bed, taking his hands calmly and moving them away. Peter barely allows his ministrations, his groan coming out more guttural and unsettling since his mouth was open. He rolls onto his back so Tony can see better. He winces when Tony\u2019s fingers brush against his face. \u201cHey, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019m just taking a quick look. No surprises.\u201d</p><p>Tony takes his chin in his right hand as carefully as he can. Peter\u2019s mouth is almost shut, his teeth bared like they usually would be mid-yawn. They couldn\u2019t have been more than an inch apart, his mouth more a rectangle than an <i>O.</i></p><p>He was gasping at the back of his throat, eyes roaming over Tony in question. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, easy. You\u2019ve probably just clenched it too hard in your sleep and it\u2019s locked. It\u2019s happened to me before.\u201d Peter tries to nod in Tony\u2019s hold. </p><p>Tony takes his hot face more firmly in his hands and runs his thumbs in circles along the highest point of his jaw bone, the bases of his palms just above the wrist cushioning his chin. \u201cStop me if this hurts too much, alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a <i>nuh-uh</i> sound in response. Tony takes it as reassurance that what he\u2019s doing is actually helping. </p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He says again and again, his brow furrowed and face calculating as he searches Peter\u2019s face for any signs of new pain or discomfort. \u201cI know it hurts, but it\u2019s helping. Promise. I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d He jokes. Peter\u2019s eyes shine for a moment, then dull back into his <i>This Hurts But I\u2019m Not One to Complain</i> calibre of Brave Face.</p><p>Slowly, <i>slowly,</i> the pain implicit in the kid\u2019s features recedes, and his jaw eases back to being closed. Tony smoothes over the grooves of his bone structure in inspection. He isn\u2019t sure whether it was fully better or not.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna try opening?\u201d</p><p>Peter twitches it from side to side like he\u2019s swishing mouthwash.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he tries, in a croak. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot better. Thanks, Mr Stark. Really. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles softly. He hopes that the disquiet in his head wasn\u2019t showing on his face. <i>What the hell is wrong with this kid?</i></p><p>\u201cJeez, that was actually kind of embarrassing.\u201d Peter says slowly, working his jaw out with each word. He rubs his cheek, which was blushing beneath his touch. \u201cThat\u2019s some pretty good ammo to use against me, me sitting here like a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a fish?\u201d Tony chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like a\u2014\u201d Peter makes a stupid face, puffing his cheeks and lazily circling his lips. \u201c\u2014a\u2014a fish.\u201d </p><p>His eyes narrow in affection. \u201cSure.\u201d He huffs a quick laugh out of his nose.</p><p>Peter was covering for how the pain he was feeling right now \u2013 he knows that \u2013 and Tony doesn\u2019t want to break the light atmosphere between them by pointing it out.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, that hurt, but\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s feeling better now though.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Better\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018It doesn\u2019t hurt at all\u2019. </i>\u201cAnything else hurt?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t reply. His forced swallow answers for him. Face a picture of exasperation, Tony\u2019s eyes widen as his eyebrows practically hit his hairline, head cocking to the side in an entirely too paternal show of anticipation of <i>the truth.</i></p><p>Peter reads his expression. He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>Tony purses his lips, eyes blinking slowly and chin retracting into his neck as he stares into space. Sarcasm laces his every movement. <i>Say that one more time, and I swear to god\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you think that <i>\u2018I\u2019ve had worse\u2019</i> somehow placates me. At all. Ha ha. You\u2019re actually very amusing, Peter, has anyone ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes slide shut, deflating. \u201cI\u2019m only telling you the truth. Truth hurts sometimes.\u201d His voice held the quality of someone trying not to fall asleep in a second flat. When he speaks again, he\u2019s somehow mustered a sombre tone that provokes Tony into almost believing him. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m okay. Just my neck and my throat hurt. And my jaw. And just a little headache. But, it\u2019s like\u2014localised? So it\u2019s okay. I took a hard hit round there on patrol, the other night. And the whiplash thing that you said. Think that. It\u2019s not that bad. Really, s\u2019all good.\u201d </p><p> \u201cSure. And what about the fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI run hot, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve got the flu, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>He almost hits the roof in surprise when that doesn\u2019t make Peter \u00a0immediately rise up in debate. \u201cMaybe. Be gone tomorrow. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sorries. Only getting betters.\u201d Tony places a cool hand over Peter\u2019s jaw again, presses lightly.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019okay.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, he nods slowly. It\u2019s clear Peter has a high tolerance for pain, and a low tolerance for being worried about. If the kid said he was okay, he had to believe him and leave him, he guessed. </p><p>He makes Peter finish the water, even though it seems to really hurt his throat, and refills it. He puts it within arms reach and opens all the windows. </p><p>Then he gets one of the washcloths from the bathroom and soaks it through. He puts it on Peter\u2019s forehead and leaves it there. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if it gets worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019f course, M\u2019st\u2019r Stark.\u201d Peter curls back onto his side, washcloth sliding down so it\u2019s propped up between his bangs and the quickly soaking pillow. Tony counts it as a win if it\u2019s still touching his skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay, kid.\u201d He pats Peter\u2019s leg \u2013 who he was sure had already passed right out - and goes back to his sketchpads and plans.</p><p>He\u2019s shifted some papers aside and is just opening his laptop to try Googling the kid\u2019s symptoms for some semblance of understanding \u2013 of what the hell might be going on, of how to help the kid (<i>of why his super healing hadn\u2019t kicked in to fix a simple knock to the larynx, and then he gets the flu, for god\u2019s sake, it\u2019s stressing me out</i>) when a quiet but indignant, croaking question rises up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be sleeping? It\u2019s <i>late</i>.\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts. \u201cToo many questions from an inquisitive Spiderling for one day. Go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked <i>one</i> question.\u201d Peter mumbles into his pillow. </p><p>Tony tastes the <i>I\u2019m fine</i> on his tongue and almost laughs at his hypocrisy. He sighs, shutting his laptop. \u201cFinding the concept of sleep a little difficult to grasp at present, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried list\u2019ning to\u2026 like\u2026 rain?\u201d </p><p>Tony smirks at the &gt;90% unconscious teen on the bed. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He watches the kid, who, with his eyes closed, runs his fingers along the charger till they meet his phone, fumbles a couple times to unlock it, and swipes to a white noise app. \u201cS\u2019\u2026good. Helps me sleep, y\u2019know?\u201d </p><p>Heavy rain and the gush of ocean surf fill the room. Peter tucks his phone beneath his pillow, giving the sound a round, enclosed property that makes it all the more calming. </p><p><i>It helps him block everything else out. </i></p><p><i>Everything\u2019s dialled to 11. </i></p><p>\u201cY\u2019should sleep, you know, Mis\u2019r Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete. Fine. I\u2019m gonna.\u201d</p><p>He mostly lies down on the couch to appease the kid.</p><p>He mostly falls <i>asleep</i> because of the rainy lull that envelopes the room and the echo of <i>it\u2019s not that bad</i> that\u2019s running around his head.</p><p>He wakes to Peter calling his name.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark? I\u2014 <i>ah</i>\u2014\u201d A gasp.</p><p>He pauses for a split second, checking to make sure he didn\u2019t imagine it, then sits bolt upright. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark,\u201d he sounds breathless. Tony reaches for the lamp. </p><p>Illumination billows into the room like smoke and he feels his pupils constrict. His eyes go straight to the kid sitting on the floor, knees drawn up. \u201c<i>Peter?</i>\u201d</p><p>Well, whaddya know?<i> It </i>is<i> that bad.</i></p><p>He crouches before him and wraps a hand around a trembling bicep. That arm is cradling his stomach.</p><p>The other is held awkwardly aloft \u2013 it\u2019s bent so that his elbow is pointing to the ceiling. His face is pressed into the crook of it, and his hand pushes into his neck like he\u2019s desperately trying to alleviate pressure, clawing at it like he\u2019s in agony.</p><p>His face is scrunched up, and he\u2019s breathing harsh and heavy.</p><p>Tony pushes a hand up onto his cheek. \u201cHey. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter just gasps. </p><p>\u201cPete? You\u2019re scaring me here, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 move. I can\u2019t move.\u201d Is forced out through ground teeth.</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach pits. <i>What is this?</i></p><p>Some kind of parasite? Is he going through <i>paralysis? </i></p><p><i>Oh, god. He hoped not.</i></p><p>He schools his features and grabs<i> Initiative</i> firmly by the throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Alright, Peter, where does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes on his breath. \u201c<i>Everywhere</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods, shifts the leg that held his weight. \u201cYeah, I figured. Okay, bud, I\u2019m going to move you real slow, okay? I need you lying down, because I\u2019m very conscious of you passing out right about now. I\u2019ll do the work, okay? Don\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d </p><p>It was like untangling a fierce knot. Tony knew he couldn\u2019t help it. Peter\u2019s super-strength fights against every small touch, and he\u2019s very close to crying - and not stopping. Tony could sense it in his breathing, in his face, in his jarred swallowing. He could literally sense it like a balmy air threatening rain. It was the worst feeling.</p><p>He starts by straightening one of his legs, wanting to put off moving his arms for as long as possible. Now with room in front of him, Peter slowly leans forward to be against Tony. Tony swallows hard and rubs his back. </p><p><i>Do I move him or not? God, do I </i>move him or not?!</p><p>Peter decides for him.</p><p>\u201cI can stand.\u201d He grinds out. Tony doesn\u2019t argue with him. His hands hover over his back as he heaves himself up and sits back on the bed. </p><p>Once he\u2019s down, and his arms are no longer raised, Tony crouches by his head. He squints at him till they have eye contact. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look good, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives him the saddest of small smiles. Tears are pricking at his tear ducts, and the smile drops. He looks like a little kid. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know. But we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d </p><p>Up close, Peter smells of sweat and the same floral detergent that their entire apartment smells like. Tony thinks of May, and what she\u2019d do. </p><p>Peter\u2019s trembling. He\u2019s paler than a sheet and his voice is little more than a crackle. He\u2019s burning up, and Tony knows that everything above his shoulders is pure agony. </p><p>Something flashes through his mind, a possible diagnosis that rings a bell when the words<i> lockjaw</i> and <i>stiff neck</i> and <i>fever</i> go together, but he shakes his head. Peter\u2019s been vaccinated. May <i>is</i> not,<i> was</i> not, never was and never will be, an anti-vaxxer. He knows that for certain. </p><p><i>But it looks so much like\u2026</i></p><p>Peter groans, eyes glassy. He shuts them and Tony tangles his fingers in his hair and massages his scalp. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, bud.\u201d</p><p>He knows what he has to do. </p><p>Happy picks up on the 11th ring. His disgruntled nature is thrown off when Tony tells him he needs a private jet or chopper or something as soon as possible, as close as possible to his current location. He texts him his co-ordinates and waits for a text back with his ETA.</p><p>3 hours. And he\u2019s bringing Bruce.</p><p>3 hours till medical attention. Around 6 hours till they\u2019re back at the compound. He looks at Peter desperately. He\u2019s tingling all over with adrenaline and fear. He could literally see the kid going downhill.</p><p>The nearest hospital\u2019s much farther than 3 fucking hours. He\u2019d made FRIDAY look into getting something directly to the hospital \u2013 a medical chopper, or something, he didn\u2019t know. Turned out to be 5 hour round trip so he sticks with Bruce and Happy, and a jet with a full medsuite available.</p><p>So they\u2019re stranded till then. </p><p>Things just always seemed to work out that way, didn\u2019t they?</p><p>He sits on the bed beside Peter and holds his hand. Peter squeezes it in what Tony can\u2019t decide is a coping mechanism for the pain, or meant to calm him down until he numbly realises it\u2019s probably both.</p><p>\u201cPeter? I need you to hold on, okay? I\u2019m getting you help. I think\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m really sorry. But you\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Peter gasps. He\u2019s speaking slowly, from the pain in his jaw, and Tony can\u2019t help but let the scary diagnosis word hurl itself against the padded walls of his Crazy House mind over and over.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet.</p><p>They both have their self-prescribed tasks: Tony rubs his thumb over Peter\u2019s knuckles and watches his phone like a hawk. Peter tries to suck it up and swallows back groans and whimpers like there\u2019s no tomorrow. He doesn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Well. </p><p>It <i>is</i> quiet, till Peter speaks.</p><p>He speaks calmly. Matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cMy stomach hurts.\u201d </p><p>Tony straightens, all unsure and nervous. \u201cOkay. Alright. Can I\u2014can I take a look?\u201d </p><p>He raises his pyjama top and rubs his hands together till they\u2019re warm. Peter still sucks in a breath when they make contact.</p><p>He gently \u2013 god, he could not be more gentle if he tried, and it\u2019s still hurting him, <i>he\u2019s</i> still hurting him \u2013 palpates his stomach, and both of them gasp at the same time.</p><p>It\u2019s hard as rock. </p><p>He looks at Peter, fear and definite realisation dawning on him. His heart sinks, thudding in fear for the kid. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Peter rasps. Now his hand\u2019s free from Tony\u2019s hold, it joins his other limbs in sliding sluggishly against the comforter in pain and discomfort as he rides out another wave of flashing cramps. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p>Tony shakes his head and lowers his shirt. He takes back Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cNothing. You\u2019re okay. It\u2019s alright.\u201d He says fruitlessly. He feels so stupid. He doesn\u2019t know what to do!</p><p>\u201cMr Stark?\u201d</p><p>Tony turns and palms Peter\u2019s face, hoping Peter\u2019s going to ask him to do something for him, to give him <i>something</i> to do to help. \u201cKid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna throw up.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s sitting up and heaving and crying before Tony can grab the trash can, and suddenly he has a sobbing kid covered in vomit and their only bed faring not much better. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s <i>really</i> crying now. He\u2019s holding his stomach and bent over it as much as his neck will allow. </p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNot your fault, Underoos. Not at all. Don\u2019t you worry about it. My job.\u201d He reassures, as warmly as he can. \u201cYou got more?\u201d </p><p>Peter says no. He laughs once. Tony isn\u2019t sure why he laughs, but it\u2019s completely devoid of humour anyway and then rapidly followed by a breathy groan when his jaw disagrees with the action. </p><p>\u201cMaybe talking isn\u2019t a good idea right now, huh, buddy?\u201d Tony suggests, not unkindly. \u201cI would tell you to nod, but uh\u2026\u201d </p><p>Peter settles for the thumbs up/down approach.</p><p>Tony helps him shift so his back\u2019s against the headboard, wedging a pillow between his neck and shoulders so he feels as little pain as possible. </p><p>He strips the comforter from beneath him \u2013 it hasn\u2019t soaked through, thankfully \u00a0- and throws it into the corner. He replaces it with his blanket from the couch. </p><p>Then he finds the washcloth and fills up a bowl of warm water. He cleans up Peter\u2019s face, wiping at the sick and tears and sweat with no sarcastic comment, only soft reassurances.</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression is a mixture of mortified and miserable. He\u2019s still shaking, and once Tony\u2019s eased off his shirt \u2013 something that makes Peter cry out despite his best efforts not to \u2013 he replaces it with one of his own sleep shirts and Peter\u2019s hoodie. </p><p>The pants are a different matter. Peter\u2019s eyes are closed, and he\u2019s breathing deeply like Tony\u2019s told him to. He can\u2019t leave the kid in them, but he doesn\u2019t want to undress him when changing his shirt was the <i>Worst Moment of his Life So Far,</i> according to the kid\u2019s expression. </p><p>He\u2019s giving him a breather from the movement when he notices Peter\u2019s jaw is locked again, and it\u2019s stuck in this sinister sort-of grin that Tony can hardly look at. He does the massaging like he did before until Peter\u2019s mouth is shut. As it closes, he groans loudly and it dissolves into a grimaced set of sobs. </p><p>His eyes are squeezed shut and he knows the kid wants nothing more than to arch his back and neck like he does when he\u2019s hurting, but he can\u2019t. It damn near breaks Tony\u2019s heart.</p><p>He waits for him to open his eyes again, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cUm. Pete?\u201d Peter opens his eyes slowly. \u201cHi. Only me. Uh\u2026 hate to say this, but we\u2019re gonna have to change your pants, kiddo.\u201d He groans. \u201c\u2014I know, I know, Pete. I\u2019m sorry. But I can\u2019t let you sit in it. Your aunt would kill me.\u201d</p><p>Peter uses the hand that isn\u2019t clutching his stomach to give a shaky and reluctant thumbs-up.</p><p>He finds a fresh pair of underwear and a pair of sweats in Peter\u2019s bag and brings them over. Peter swallows forcefully.</p><p>\u201cAaaalrighty. How d\u2019you wanna do this?\u201d </p><p>Peter edges to the edge of the bed, Tony catching on quickly. He wavers, but does manage stay up of his own steam. Tony knows it\u2019s agony for him. \u201cShut your eyes.\u201d He croaks from behind his teeth. </p><p>Tony rolls them, instead. He has one grounding hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPeter, it\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cShut.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know whether that meant <i>shut up</i> or <i>shut your eyes so help me god</i>, but he decides he may as well do both. He\u2019s desperate for Peter to lay down again and though it may not seem like it with some of the pranks he pulls on the kid sometimes, he does give at least <i>half</i> a damn about his dignity. He still has his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder, he figures, so it can\u2019t go too badly wrong.</p><p>Well.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019s S\u2019ark.\u201d </p><p>Tony opens his eyes. Peter\u2019s in his new boxers, but the sweats are on the carpet. He\u2019s looking decidedly <i>worse</i> than ever, and Tony has to stoop and wrap his arms round him for fear of him fainting.</p><p>Peter\u2019s drooling. Tony idly hopes it\u2019s from the lack of movement in his jaw and not because he\u2019s about to toss his cookies again. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 look.\u201d He whispers.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNot looking.\u201d</p><p>Peter whines softly into his shoulder. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>Tony hushes him, at a complete loss of what to do or say or be. It\u2019s hurting him, too. \u201cWhat can I do, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>His stomach pitches in affection and raw concern. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere, buddy. I\u2019ve invested too much money in you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t laugh. In fact, he doesn\u2019t react at all. His breathing\u2019s calmed, he\u2019s leaning all the more heavier into Tony, and it doesn\u2019t take a genius to knows he\u2019s passed out. </p><p>So he panics.</p><p>He panics, laying him back down and checking his pulse on his neck - \u00a0and then his wrist for good measure. It\u2019s there, strong and maybe a little fast, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s okay. </p><p>He\u2019s still breathing. He double checks that, too, and allows himself to relax. He\u2019s passed out from exertion. From pain, maybe, though he doubts it. Peter\u2019s taken a hell of a lot of pain before and been okay. This is a whole new level. </p><p>Something different.</p><p>Tetanus.</p><p>He\u2019s pretty sure. </p><p>He graciously as possible pulls Peter\u2019s sweats on and some socks after it. It feels a little too much like dressing a dead body for his liking, but he\u2019s checked Peter\u2019s breathing about five times now, and he is. </p><p>He texts Happy to go<i> faster</i> and brings his computer over. He looks up tetanus and frowns. </p><p>He spares the sleeping teen a look. \u201cYou had to go whole-hog, didn\u2019t you. Couldn\u2019t get a head cold like everyone else.\u201d</p><p><i>Fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate\u2026 \u00a0</i></p><p>His fingers rest on Peter\u2019s jumpy pulse point as he reads.</p><p><i>Facial spasms. Difficulty swallowing. Abdominal tenseness.</i></p><p><i>\u2026 can be fatal if not treated quickly.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>O</i>-kay. Yep. Uh-huh. That\u2019s enough of the scary stories.\u201d He slams the laptop shut and sits waiting for the silence to reply to him.</p><p>He checks his watch. Another hour and a half.</p><p>He wipes Peter\u2019s brow, makes sure the hoodie isn\u2019t too thick.</p><p>Paces a little, moves the trash can closer to the bed, carries on pacing. </p><p>All but runs to <i>actually</i> ask Hagrid for a thermometer. He doesn\u2019t have one, so he just grabs some ice from the machine and puts the bucket in the bathtub just in case. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll know when to use it but he feels better knowing it\u2019s there.</p><p>He paces again. Then he stands by the door and holds it open, looking for headlights. Then he paces again. </p><p>He stands with his hands in his pockets and stares at the kid, who\u2019s now stirred enough to reassure him he\u2019s not out cold anymore; though still not getting any kind of <i>peaceful</i> sleep. Bodily sighing, his swipes his foot over the carpet. The fibres flip over and he makes an infinity symbol pattern over and over with the midsole of his shoe. He\u2019s pleased that it took up 2 whole minutes \u2013 only 51 to go.</p><p>He wonders if he should wake him and make him drink some water.</p><p>He packs both their things up and puts the bags by the door. He paces just a little more because his feet are buzzing from inactivity.</p><p>He decides he <i>should</i> wake the kid. He decides against it. He decides against the deciding against it. He makes some coffee and doesn\u2019t drink any of it. </p><p>He wishes, and wishes, and wishes again he hadn\u2019t taken the kid on this trip.</p><p>He hopes to god he\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>Peter lets out a hushed, crackly, <i>heartbreaking </i>whine from the back of his throat. Tony re-wets the washcloth and moves the trash can a little closer. He sits and cups his cheek. It feels like a placebo method of willing his temperature down, but he\u2019ll take anything over feeling completely useless.</p><p>When his phone starts to ring with 32 minutes left, he almost jumps out of his skin. He drops Peter\u2019s hand and moves to the kitchenette to answer. \u201cGimme good news, Hogan.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cDriving to you now. How\u2019s he doing?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThank God. He\u2019s asleep. How long till you\u2019re here? Bruce there? Tell him it\u2019s tetanus. I mean\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s tetanus now. Though I\u2019m open alternative diagnoses. My pride can take the hit.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cJesus, Tony\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNavigation thing says 12 minutes. See you in 8. Yes, Bruce is here.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHolding you to 8. Drive safe. Drive fast.\u201d</p><p>7 minutes later, a dishevelled Bruce is jumping out of a blue Audi, dragging his medcase with him. Tony waves, and he jogs over. </p><p>\u201cHi, Tony.\u201d He says. Tony doesn\u2019t know how Bruce manages to sound apologetic in everything he says, but he can and does.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for coming.\u201d He ushers him in and Bruce heads straight for the bed. He gasps when he feels Peter\u2019s forehead, and he looks at Tony, an appalled look on his face. </p><p>\u201cPlease. Help him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Tony regales the entire story to Bruce as he inflates a blood pressure cuff and waits for his temperature to take. He doesn\u2019t look impressed when the readings come through onto a device he\u2019s holding.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Tetanus? Or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, tetanus or <i>not</i>, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s taking advantage of his enhanced state. I\u2019ve never seen something this serious advance so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what does that mean? Is he gonna recover quicker? Is he dying?\u201d Tony babbles. Bruce just shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Tony doesn\u2019t have the gall to ask which question he\u2019s answering. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re right. I\u2019m gonna give him the tetanus antitoxin and set up an IV now. He needs to be back on the jet.\u201d</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look away when the huge needle pierces his arm, or when the IV goes into his hand. He stands there, helpless and hapless and a complete fucking idiot who\u2019s going to let his kid die because he couldn\u2019t recognise tetanus if it slapped him in the face.</p><p>He <i>feels</i> like he\u2019s been slapped in the face.</p><p>\u201cCan you carry him?\u201d Bruce is looking at him like he\u2019s said this question already. Tony nods, gormless. Bruce nods back. \u201cI\u2019ve given him a short-acting barbiturate sedation to keep him out till the jet at least. This is going to hurt his neck, so be gentle, Tony, be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Tony is gentle. He hugs the kid to him for the entire tense car ride \u2013 Happy breaking the speed limit what feels like twice over, Bruce taking readings and feeling Peter\u2019s neck and jaw and stomach whilst holding an IV up in the air.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d have been able to breathe a sigh of relief when he got Peter onto the medbay bed, but he just\u2026 can\u2019t.</p><p>Can\u2019t breathe. </p><p>He watches wires and nurses swamp his kid from his freakout corner. They take his blood to look for anything else \u2013 though Bruce is almost adamant it\u2019s tetanus by now, and he\u2019s injecting Peter with needle after needle of antibiotics. They get to work on his jaw and neck, doing stuff that Tony has no idea how to explain.</p><p>They cut through his hoodie and place cooling gel packs on him. Tony shifts on his feet, because Peter really liked that old hoodie, and he knows his guilt will force him to trawl <i>eBay</i> for another lookalike till he finds another one for the poor kid.</p><p>It won\u2019t be the same. The lettering won\u2019t be faded and the drawstring won\u2019t be missing and it won\u2019t smell like the rest of May\u2019s laundry\u2014</p><p>May.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to call the kid\u2019s aunt.\u201d He murmurs to nobody in particular. He slips out of the room.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. Again, he\u2019s surprised to not be relieved at all. The <i>leave a message after the beep</i> beep beeps and he stares at the wall. </p><p>\u201cMay. It\u2019s me. I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could give me a call back as soon as you can. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>His screen lights up with her name a second later. </p><p><i>\u201cTony?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMay.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTony, what\u2019s happened? Are you okay? Is Peter?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAre you sitting down?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me. Tell me right now.\u201d</i></p><p>He gulps. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s not okay. He\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick? <i>Oh, my god. What\u2019s wrong with him? Can I speak to him?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 well, we\u2019re not 100% yet. Tests are coming back in soon. But we think\u2026 May, we think it\u2019s tetanus.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTetanus? Oh, my god. My poor baby. Tetanus? Tony, it can\u2019t be tetanus. I got him immunised. I\u2014I made sure he got all his boosters! He hasn\u2019t been bit by any feral animals or\u2014how do you even get it? What\u2019s happening to him? Where are you? I need to see my baby.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI believe you got him vaccinated. And it doesn\u2019t have to be through an animal bite. I don\u2019t really know how else, I only Googled it for a second. Dirt? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThe mud run\u2026\u201d</i> May breathes. Tony straightens. She\u2019s right.</p><p>Peter ran a charity mud run <i>twice</i> a few days ago. Once as Peter Parker, once as Spider-Man. The kid only needed one small cut, or to have accidentally ingested some of the dirt, and it\u2019d be straight to Tetanus Town. Especially with a healing factor like his \u2013 anything that got into a cut Peter had would be sealed in within the hour. </p><p>\u201cGod, I think you\u2019re right. FRIDAY, let Bruce know.\u201d He sits down on the edge of a plush seat. \u201cAnd he\u2019s asleep right now. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in any pain, at least.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s been in a lot of pain?\u201d</i> May asks quietly.</p><p>Tony steadies his hand by shoving it between his knees. \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t realise soon enough what was going on. It\u2019s my fault. His neck was hurting, and his jaw seized up at one point. He threw up on himself, and I\u2026 he had a dizzy spell, for god\u2019s sake, and I didn\u2019t <i>realise.</i>\u201d He only just holds back from saying <i>and now it might be too late.</i></p><p>May is silent. <i>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOn a jet back to the compound. I can send a car to pick you up when we\u2019re an hour out.\u201d He says. He can sense her anger at him, and he actually wants to see her so he can be chewed out.</p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can drive myself.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, May.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019m going to be getting any more <i>in loco parentis</i> opportunities anytime soon.\u201d He can\u2019t quite keep the self-reproach out of his deadpan tone.</p><p><i>\u201cTony. I know my nephew. I know what he\u2019s like. I know you look after him. You\u2019re on a private jet, are you not? I\u2019m assuming you cleaned up vomit from him, did you not? Tony, this wasn\u2019t your fault. Trust me. I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m just scared. I\u2019m\u2026 really in the dark here.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when Bruce knows more. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOkay. If he wakes up, tell him I love him and I\u2019ll be waiting for him when you land, okay?\u201d</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s heart twists. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t even hung up before Happy comes in, foregoing knocking. \u201cHe\u2019s coming round.\u201d</p><hr><p>Peter comes round all at once. He shouts out in agony, and Bruce leaps to dole out the analgesia. Tony cups his cheek instantly, blocking his eyes from roaming around the darkened room. \u201cHey. Look at me, kiddo. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re alright. Bruce is gonna help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s lip is trembling. A tear\u2019s path gets cut off by Tony\u2019s hand, and he uses his middle finger to wipe them away. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here, okay? Where you can see me.\u201d</p><p>Bruce nods at him. </p><p>\u201cNow, listen, Pete. We don\u2019t know how yet, but you\u2019ve contracted tetanus. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it in biology class. It\u2019s not fun, and I\u2019m really so sorry it\u2019s happened like this. But I <i>promise</i> you we\u2019re gonna get you better.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stands behind Peter\u2019s head, shaking a vial of something. He pauses when Tony doesn\u2019t continue and meets his eyes. <i>Tell him what I told you.</i></p><p>Tony looks down sadly. Peter\u2019s eyes are wide and bright from the tears and pain, watching him steadily.</p><p>\u201cI do promise you we\u2019ll fix this. But I also\u2026 I can\u2019t lie to you. It\u2019s not gonna be easy, Pete. You got the facial spasms, right? And your stomach hurt?\u201d He placed a gentle hand on Peter\u2019s stomach and rubbed as gently as possible. Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered shut. \u201cWell, now your jaw\u2019s locked into place. And it\u2019ll keep advancing till you\u2019re having these sort-of\u2026 god, Peter I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re gonna have these\u2026 Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Peter.\u201d Bruce moves into the frame of Peter\u2019s eyeline. \u201cWhat Tony\u2019s trying to say is that your muscles are going to go into spasm all over your body. It\u2019ll be like having a seizure. I\u2019m giving you as much pain relief as I can. It\u2019s\u2026 really not fun. Sorry, kid.\u201d</p><p>Tony takes his hand. \u201cPeter, how bad is the pain out of ten? Squeeze.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes ten times.</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart breaks into another million pieces with each weak clasp.</p><p>Bruce stares at him, waiting for a number. </p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, I\u2019m sorry Peter.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s somehow horrible to not hear Peter say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d </p><p>If he\u2019s honest, it\u2019s horrible not to hear anything at all. The balance is all off. He\u2019s never craved one of Peter\u2019s nerdy, trip-over-your-words rants more than right now.</p><p>Bruce ups the morphine dosage a little higher and goes about prepping the most effective diazepam formula for Peter\u2019s oncoming seizures. Tony carries on trying to calm him.</p><p>\u201cOh. And I talked to your aunt.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes fly open at that \u2013 Tony can see in them that if he could have, he\u2019d have asked about May. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there when we land. She told me to say \u2018I love you\u2019. Not me. Her. I don\u2019t love you. You know I\u2019ve always found you to be a chronic menace.\u201d Tony huffs a tired laugh and runs his hand through Peter\u2019s hair, leaving it there as a comforting gesture. Peter eyelids slide shut again.</p><p>The next three hours go about as smoothly as Tony had expected. </p><p>Peter graduates from a nasal cannula to a loud, invasive oxygen mask that he very clearly doesn\u2019t like. The second it\u2019s on, his hands are balling up and he\u2019s crying. One of them eventually fumbles for Tony\u2019s.</p><p>He ends up knowing every line and hair on them intimately, as it stays firmly grasped in his for the rest of the flight. If he loosens his grip, Peter\u2019s fingers flounder and the guilt swallows him whole.</p><p>The diazepam works well to slow down the body tremors for a while, but they really set off just as they\u2019re banking to land. </p><p>It\u2019s horrific. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes are open, darting around and terrified. His entire body seizes at once, his torso, arms and legs aggressively jerking inwards every second or so. It looks like some kind of demonic possession in a horror movie, and Tony wants nothing more than to look away. To just let it pass. He\u2019s <i>never </i>wanted something to end so much in his entire life. And he\u2019s been captured and tortured by terrorists. </p><p>But he\u2019s seen awful things before, and he likes to think he can handle anything like a mature adult. He\u2019s a superhero, for god\u2019s sake. He can do this.</p><p>Especially for Peter.</p><p>Peter\u2019s strong. He\u2019s stronger than Tony could ever be. </p><p>But\u2026 he\u2019s still a kid. And he\u2019s terrified, and he\u2019s in agony.</p><p>So he whispers to the kid, whether he can hear him or not, strokes his cheek, hums to him, cards his hand through his sweaty hair. </p><p>Bruce squeezes his shoulder as he rushes past. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Tony. Keep doing that, okay?\u201d</p><p>He cannot imagine the pain Peter\u2019s in. He asks for him to be sedated, but Bruce sadly explains that with Peter\u2019s enhanced state, they need him awake. They don\u2019t know how fast this thing is gonna progress, and they need to monitor his alertness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re landing now, buddy. Not too long. Get you down to the compound and get you fixed right up. Be back to doing backflips off the Empire State and scaring the hell out of me in no time.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes his hand hard in between jolts. \u201cI know, Pete. I know.\u201d</p><hr><p>May goes almost\u2026 <i>green</i> when she sees Peter. They\u2019re pushing him on the stretcher into the med bay, which she\u2019s sat outside of, ripping up an old receipt into little pieces that fall into her purse.</p><p>Peter\u2019s whole body is jolting again and again and again like he\u2019s being electrocuted and there are wires going everywhere, and the big scary oxygen mask dwarfs his face. He\u2019s making a broken keening sound in the back of his throat, which heightens when Tony reluctantly lets go of his hand to give the team room to work around him. They disappear through the medbay doors, one of them requesting they give them some time to stabilise him.</p><p>May is frozen, standing there with her purse on the ground. Pieces of receipt are scattered everywhere.</p><p>Her head turns and she stares at him with big eyes. </p><p>She looks worn ragged with worry. </p><p>Tony guesses he doesn\u2019t look much different.</p><p>\u201cHe just started going downhill\u2026\u201d he supplies uselessly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him?\u201d </p><p>Tony just looks back at her. May is the kind of woman whose entire composure begs you not to fuck with her. Or lie to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Hopefully get better.\u201d He feels the last word come out as an empty laugh, and he drops down into one of the chairs, head in hands. His neck twinges, and he automatically imagines how Peter\u2019s must feel. \u201cSorry, May. Just gimme a sec.\u201d</p><p>He feels the seat next to him dip down. \u201cIf anyone can get through this, it\u2019s him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t <i>have</i> to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is. And there\u2019s nothing we can do to reverse that.\u201d May says sternly. Then her voice softens. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Tony. And you know if he could, he\u2019d tell you that. He\u2019d hate to think you were upset over him. You know what he\u2019s like, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony tilts his head to look up at her. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult not to feel accountable. That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d He shrugs and claps his hands together.</p><p>May\u2019s expression is empathetic and warm. It\u2019s never been more clear to him where Peter gets it from. </p><p>\u201cYou look like you could use a shower and one hell of a coffee IV. Go. Your FRIDAY voice thing can tell you if we\u2019re allowed in to see him, right?\u201d </p><p>Tony nods. Although it was a suggestion, he can\u2019t help but feel that May has ordered it. \u201cYeah. Alright.\u201d</p><p>He stands to leave, but so does May. She puts a hand on his shoulder. He turns, surprised. </p><p>She kisses his cheek. \u201cThank you. For looking after him. He\u2019d be lost without you.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes fill a little \u2013 his eyes flit up and down her face and he swallows. She nods at him, squeezes his shoulder and heads towards the coffee machine. He watches her go and marvels at how amazing women are. </p><p>He holds that thought the whole time he showers, as he shaves and as he gets dressed. </p><p>The sentiment grows and blooms in his chest, warm, as Pepper comes in and straightens the wrinkles from his t-shirt. She evaluates his face, hands either side of it, and presses a soft kiss to his lips. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that question with a fiery burning passion.\u201d He kisses her again and they wrap around each other. </p><p>Pepper gives him a look and goes to sit with May when they\u2019re leaving his room to find Steve, Nat, Clint and Wanda waiting in the living area for news. They all look expectantly up as he enters, and Tony tenses up till he reads the sympathy in their stances.</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s sent me 4 texts about him.\u201d Steve huffs a laugh. Tony smiles.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be ecstatic to hear that.\u201d Tony knows Peter thinks Sam Wilson is about the coolest guy on the planet. He\u2019s pretty sure the feeling is mutual, especially ever since Sam found out that Peter had chosen to write an essay on him, specifically on his work as a PTSD counsellor. </p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s okay?\u201d Wanda asks.</p><p>Tony sighs. Their faces fall. \u201cNo. He\u2019s not good right now. Bruce says it is tetanus, and he\u2019s given him the antitoxin, and the antibiotics, and the anticonvulsants\u2026 he\u2019s had about every anti under the sun at this point, but\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHis enhanced healing isn\u2019t working?\u201d Nat asks.</p><p>Tony shakes his head, holding up his hand to lazily point at her in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the kid get so much as a runny nose before, let alone tetanus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez. Tetanus. It\u2019s rough.\u201d Clint mutters, looking angry. Clint\u2019s the kinda guy to issue a death threat against tetanus itself. Tony wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he succeeded, either.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything we can do?\u201d Steve asks tentatively.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know what <i>I</i> can do, Rogers.\u201d Tony murmurs. \u201cJust\u2026 <i>when</i> he gets better,\u201d they all nod enthusiastically at his wishful wording, \u201ccome visit him? Kid loves hanging out with you losers, for some reason.\u201d He smiles at them, knowing that exhaustion and anxiety are blatant on his face. </p><p>They all smile softly and nod, agreeing unequivocally. Tony jerks his head back at them. \u201cThanks, folks. Does, uh, anyone else want coffee? I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss, Dr Banner\u2019s about to speak to May Parker.\u201d </p><p>\u201cScratch that. Make your own coffee, I guess, you lazy schmucks.\u201d</p><p>Tony Stark doesn\u2019t run anywhere unless there\u2019s a fire behind him or a single-malt scotch ahead of him, but he can\u2019t really in good faith deny that he didn\u2019t jog down to medical.</p><p>Bruce is waiting for him, May no longer there. </p><p>Bruce always looks tired so he has to take a second to digest the dark bags under the man\u2019s eyes as he approaches him. \u201cHi, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Tony puts his hand on his shoulder. \u201cD\u2019you wanna sit?\u201d</p><p>Bruce hesitates. He says, \u201cYeah. I could sit.\u201d like Tony\u2019s offering to take him for dinner.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me straight, doc.\u201d </p><p>He squeezes his palms together till his fingers go white waiting for the bad news. The room seems to go silent as the world-ending fear he\u2019s been fighting off since May relegated him to the shower crashes down onto his chest. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gonna die. And his last word\u2019s gonna be \u201cStay.\u201d </p><p>And it\u2019s gonna play over in Tony\u2019s mind forever. The way he said it, so desperate and agonised and terrified. </p><p>He thinks he\u2019s gonna throw up till Bruce goes, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d, and he exhales like a storm wind.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank god. Bruce. Thank you. Thank you so much. I don\u2019t\u2014if you hadn\u2019t\u2014oh, thank <i>god.\u201d</i></p><p>Bruce chuckles. \u201cI gave him both chlorpromazine and the diazepam and it stopped the convulsions. He\u2019s got everything he needs now. Scans are showing that his body \u2013 you know, his enhanced metabolism and the healing factor \u2013 they\u2019re reacting well to it \u2013 I didn\u2019t have enough antibiotics or antitoxins on the plane to combat it properly but now I do, and it\u2019s turning itself around.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s shaking his head at him, grinning. \u201cI could kiss you. You know what?\u201d He takes Bruce\u2019s head in both hands and smacks his forehead with a big kiss. \u201cI can and did. You beautiful man. Thank you, Brucie. You\u2019re a myth and a legend.\u201d</p><p>Bruce blushes and smiles. He was never good at being complimented. \u201cYou can see him if you like. I didn\u2019t sedate him, but he\u2019s asleep anyway. I can still keep an eye on his brain activity that way. He isn\u2019t in nearly as much pain, either. That\u2014that was a priority.\u201d</p><p>For a second, Tony considers the fact that there in fact very well may be a god.</p><hr><p>Peter doesn\u2019t sleep for long. He\u2019s slept more in the past couple days than he probably has in the last month, and although the pain is lessened, it still can\u2019t be pleasant enough to let him stay out for long.</p><p>Tony just sends up his thanks that he\u2019s not seizing anymore. </p><p>Bruce does some simple tests on him and seems satisfied. </p><p>May is there, and she sits beside his head as he groggily turns into her thigh. She whispers to him, and he squeezes her hand to let her know he\u2019s alright. She cries a little at first, murmuring, \u201cHey, baby. Hello, Petey. Does it hurt? I know you\u2019re hurting, baby.\u201d to him and this makes him move even closer into her. He rubs her hand clumsily.</p><p>It\u2019s a reflection of exactly what she\u2019s been doing whilst he slept, and Tony once again can\u2019t help but think on how much they\u2019ve rubbed off on each other.</p><p>But then she mentions that he\u2019s in a hospital, and the realisation that he\u2019s not at home must break through the fog of his sleepy mind, because he sort-of comes to himself. </p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t you move that neck of yours, Peter Parker.\u201d May warns. Unsettled, Peter tries to swallow and gags on it, and she gingerly strokes his throat to calm him down. \u201cI\u2019m here. Tony\u2019s here. Okay? You\u2019re safe and you\u2019re getting looked after, and,\u201d she lowers her tone and catches his cheek to get his full attention, \u201cthe more you stress out, the longer it\u2019ll take for you to get better. You\u2019ve been really sick, baby. I was scared.\u201d</p><p>He gasps twice, convulsively, then settles. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, honey. You\u2019ll set Tony off too. You know what he\u2019s like.\u201d She looks up at him and winks. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t really know what Peter\u2019s doing when he eases his right hand out of May\u2019s hold and replaces it with his left, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to grab it when it\u2019s held out behind him expectantly. \u201cYep, I\u2019m here, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes it for a long while. Tony does it back, two quick squeezes like his mom used to do to his knee when he needed reassurance. </p><p>His skin is pale and cold. \u201cDamn, kid! Cold heart, cold hands, huh? Hold on, Ice Queen Elsa.\u201d Tony blows warm air onto it and he swears he sees the corner of Peter\u2019s mouth twitch up beneath the new, smaller, <i>quieter </i>oxygen mask. </p><p>\u201cBruce says he thinks he\u2019ll have his voice back by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour healing factor just needed a nudge in the right direction, huh?\u201d Tony asks Peter, who had been looking up at both at them as they chatted quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s basically what he said, yeah.\u201d May smiles. \u201cWell, at least now he\u2019s been humbled to the trials and tribulations of us <i>normies</i> without our super duper fancy healing powers.\u201d She teases. </p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have gotten something a little less dramatic, next time, could he? I already have a heart condition.\u201d Peter crushes his hand fiercely. Tony pats it with his other hand, laughing. \u201cKidding, kid. But, seriously, please don\u2019t do that again. I know you\u2019ll be desperate to repeat this fun experience, but I can\u2019t take it.\u201d May nods meaningfully at Peter, eyebrows raised. Tony sighs. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d better go and get all that stuff done that Pepper\u2019s been hounding me about. You\u2019re staying here?\u201d He asks May.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Got my four poster.\u201d She jerks her head to the cot behind her. \u201c5 stars, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s a room here for you when he\u2019s better. <i>Real</i> four poster.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI expect nothing less, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony presses his knuckles to Peter\u2019s temple and murmurs his goodbyes, then heads out. He doesn\u2019t want to go, but May\u2019s there, and he\u2019s sure they can do with some privacy.</p><p>Turns out that Pepper\u2019s first and only Big Task for him is to get some shuteye. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t even try to fight her on it.</p><hr><p>Very early the next morning, FRIDAY tells him May is heading to shower, so he heads down. </p><p>Bruce is intercepting a nurse who\u2019s carrying a fresh catheter drainage bag. He takes it from her and smiles, then sees Tony and waves. He\u2019s wearing the white coat he normally wears in the lab, with the addition of a stethoscope and the fact that it\u2019s<i> clean</i> for once.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, all rested and professional. Look at this!\u201d He flicks the drum of the stethoscope. \u201cDashing. God, you better watch out you don\u2019t get done for fraud. Anyone would think those PhDs were actually in medicine.\u201d</p><p>Bruce laughs at that. \u201cWell\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing? He speaking yet?\u201d</p><p>Bruce shakes his head. \u201cNot yet. He\u2019s responding well to everything we\u2019re giving him. Basically everything bothering him now is from the neck upwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going in the right direction? Sounds like it\u2019s basically put itself into rewind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s it. The only thing is that his blood pressure\u2019s kind of unstable. It\u2019s giving him some vertigo and a bad headache, so I\u2019m not going to reduce the analgesia yet. I get the feeling his pain tolerance is\u2026 one to be matched. His heart rate\u2019s still high and he seems a bit\u2014\u201d he mimes moving a stiff neck, \u201creluctant to move it, you know? But I don\u2019t really have a reason to believe that won\u2019t right itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Cool. That\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go in - and take this. I\u2019ll be with you soon.\u201d Tony takes the catheter bag and pushes through the doors. </p><p>Peter still looks sick as a dog, but he\u2019s on the nasal cannula now, and he seems to be in a more comfortable position. </p><p>The head of the bed has been raised somewhat, so he sees Tony when he enters. He waves at him dopily, and it makes Tony grin.</p><p>\u201cHey! Kid! The Ban-man says you\u2019re feeling a little better. That\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>Peter can manage more of a smile now. It\u2019s all lopsided, and it looks funny and heart-warming all at once. </p><p>Once Tony\u2019s sat beside him, cross-legged and beaming back, he seems satisfied enough to close his eyes. </p><p>\u201cBruce says you\u2019ve been getting some vertigo. Dizzy, huh?\u201d Peter quirks another half-smile in confirmation.</p><p>He suddenly remembers being back on the highway, Peter hunched over himself as he tries not to pass out. His chest tightens and he looks long and hard at the kid.</p><p>Peter opens an eye and looks at him. They share a look for a while before Tony speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re sick, kiddo.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes narrow. They practically <i>scream</i> at him not to apologise. Tony snickers. He can\u2019t wait to be berated by the kid when he finally gets his voice back. </p><p>In all honesty, he can\u2019t wait.</p><p>He chuckles again when Peter doesn\u2019t stop glaring. \u201cOkay, alright! No more self-pitying. God, you\u2019re mean. That\u2019s my favourite pastime.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes roll up into his eyelids as they close. \u201cI can<i> taste</i> the sarcasm on your tongue, kiddo. How can you do that when you can\u2019t even speak? Kids are so weird and moody these days.\u201d</p><p>Peter quirks an eyebrow without opening his eyes. Tony sighs and ruffles his hair. \u201cGet some more sleep, Pete.\u201d He earns a thumbs-up for that.</p><p>The room is quiet for a while. It\u2019s not an awkward one, but comfortable \u2013 like when they\u2019d been driving only a week ago and they\u2019d both fallen into companionable silence. Tony relishes it.</p><p>He decides he may as well relax too. He leans back in his chair, arms crossed, and shuts his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGotta admit, s\u2019a bit weird that <i>you</i> brought in th\u2019bag th\u2019s gunna hold my pee. Think unnerving is th\u2019word.\u201d</p><p>The next second, Tony\u2019s jumping out of his skin so high he thinks he\u2019ll be a naked skeleton for the rest of his life, and Peter\u2019s laughing his whispery, croaking laugh that is nothing but music to his ears.</p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Mis\u2019r</i> <i>S\u2019ark</i>!\u201d Peter mimics back. He\u2019s sick, and he\u2019s shaky, and his voice is weak and quiet, but he\u2019s <i>smiling</i>. Really <i>smiling.</i> Tony is grinning like a fool back at him.</p><p>He leans forward and gathers the kid in his arms for a cautious hug. \u201cYou little scoundrel!\u201d</p><p>Peter hugs him back harder than Tony\u2019s hugging him, and he pushes his nose into his neck. \u201cS\u2019rry, man. C\u2019d\u2019nt resist.\u201d</p><p>When they lean back, Peter\u2019s smile has changed. It\u2019s a quiet kind of smile. \u201cThanks f\u2019r lookin\u2019 out f\u2019r me, Mis\u2019r S\u2019ark. And\u2026 s\u2019rry f\u2019r scarin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome kid. Just\u2026 no repeats, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and then winces. He laughs at himself whilst Tony scowls at his pain. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. M\u2019okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout as okay as you can be, all things considered, I guess. How\u2019s the headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll move you down.\u201d He grabs the control and lowers the head of the bed. \u201cBit better?\u201d Peter sends him another thumbs up. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>The same calm quiet comes back, but Tony doesn\u2019t settle down again. He watches Peter\u2019s vitals for a while, then the kid himself. He\u2019s not sleeping, he knows he\u2019s feeling a little too unwell to settle down completely. But he doesn\u2019t feel that same sinking hopelessness in his stomach anymore. </p><p>\u201cHey. M\u2019s\u2019r S\u2019rk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Say, \u2018yes, P\u2019t\u2019r?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, P\u2019t\u2019r?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Shh</i>. Properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2019D\u2019n\u2019t be a pain \u2018n th\u2019neck.\u2019</i> Remember? <i>Foreshad\u2019wing.</i>\u201d He says reverently. The giddiness is evident in his voice.</p><p>Tony practically rolls his eyes into his skull. \u201cHow long have you been sitting on that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince th\u2019plane.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are the absolute worst, Parker.\u201d Tony laughs. He puts a hand through Peter\u2019s hair and smiles at him. Peter smiles back, till Tony\u2019s face falls. \u201cWait a damn second. \u2018Foreshadowing\u2019? Are you saying<i> I\u2019m</i> to blame for this?\u201d</p><p>Peter grins and shuts his eyes. </p><p>\u201cHey! Nuh-uh, no pulling the sleep card. Are you saying I injected you with tetanus, Mr Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, M\u2019s\u2019r S\u2019rk.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am so leaving you in California next time.\u201d</p>",

That would be an understatement. </p><p>45 hours of driving. Both ways. 90 hours.</p><p>Oh, what the hell. Was he really that surprised? He loves the kid. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Peter wasn\u2019t going to college for another couple years, but the kid could\u2019ve been there a long time ago. It was only natural that he was interested in the top universities the country had to offer; Stanford and Berkeley being right up there, and easily within his academic sights.</p><p>Tony had somehow managed to get May\u2019s pride complex to share a room with his desire to sponsor Peter a full ride. She\u2019d heard him out, and the whole time he was speaking, he could see the conflict on her face.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want charity. Even the implication of it made her squirm.</p><p>But she loved Peter, and she wanted him to achieve his full potential. Though her and Ben had accepted the fact a long time ago, it was still awful that they had to mortgage what felt like everything, from the roof over their head to the air in their lungs, to nurture Peter\u2019s gifts. </p><p>And here was Tony, offering him everything he deserved and more. It wouldn\u2019t make even a dent in Tony\u2019s bank balance, and it was clear he was offering out of love and care for her nephew, and nothing else. No ulterior motive, no sleazy need to sedate a guilty conscience.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t seen Peter trying to hide the Stanford prospectus under his hamper, the Yale webpage that was hastily closed when she walked past.</p><p>So she said yes. </p><p>And Peter was really grateful, and<i> really</i> happy. </p><p>They\u2019d been in the lab, working on something or other \u2013 web fluid and shooters, maybe \u2013 and Peter had been talking about California. Stanford, specifically. And how May was stressing about booking time off for an open day. </p><p>\u201cI could take you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t worry about it Mr Stark, it\u2019s cool! She\u2019ll just have to do some make-up graveyard shifts, and I was gonna help out by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFRI, compare the open day dates. Am I free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Ms Potts are in Stockholm between the 5th July and 17th August. The visitor centre isn\u2019t open outside of those dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no dice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dice, Boss.\u201d</p><p>Though Peter had politely rejected the idea, Tony could\u2019ve sworn his face fell just a little. He cleared his throat and threw a grape into his mouth, leaning back in his chair and considering. </p><p>After a minute or so of the kid side-eyeing him from his bubbling formula, he threw a grape at Peter\u2019s head to get his attention, then stared off into space innocently, pretending he hadn\u2019t thrown it. </p><p>\u201cThey know me at Stanford. I\u2019ve got sway. <i>And</i> Berkeley, I think.\u201d He shrugged, pointing at the ceiling. \u201cHit me with it, FRIDAY.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got honorary alumni status at both, Boss.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned at Peter like all his problems were solved. \u201cReally! <i>Aces</i>.\u201d </p><p>Peter narrowed his eyes. \u201cMr Stark, I\u2026 you know how thankful I am to you for funding me this scholarship, and all, and I am! Really. It\u2019s\u2026 it means so much to me. And May. But I can\u2019t just ask you to fly me out there on top of everything else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about flying? Are you putting words in my mouth again, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019ve never put\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a pain in the neck! We could make it a fun little road trip - take the Audi. I know it\u2019s your favourite. Stop at a hotel, do some sightseeing. You\u2019ve never been to San Francisco, you can be a disgusting tourist!\u201d Peter crossed his arms and rolled his eyes, not even trying to conceal his smile. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be fun! It\u2019d be a week, tops. And I can make up for being in Sweden for most of your summer.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled at him softly. \u201c<i>Usually</i> it\u2019s the kid begging the adult to let them do something crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, whoa there. Foolish, perhaps. Eccentric, possibly. But crazy? You\u2019re toeing the line, there, kid.\u201d He stood and moved to Peter\u2019s workstation, flopping into his chair and pouting dramatically. \u201cCome oooon. You never do anything fun with me.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cMr <i>Stark</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony stuck his bottom lip out further and stirred the web fluid concoction sadly. \u201cNever wants to spend time with me.\u201d He muttered. \u201cAlways with Ned. Never with Mr Stark.\u201d He sighed, slumping his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Peter laughed. \u201cFine! We can go.\u201d </p><p>They both knew he\u2019d been in from the second Tony had suggested it.</p><hr><p><i>whoa dude im so jealous!!!! Facetime me when youre at the hotel and tell me about it!!</i><br></p><p>Tony smirks to himself as he brings his eyes back to the road. That was Ned\u2019s reply to Peter\u2019s earlier text of, \u2018<i>best trip ever!!!!\u2019</i>, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel just a little bit smug about it.</p><p>He\u2019s feeling more sad than smug, though. He and Peter\u2019d had a really fun time, and he\u2019s a little disappointed it\u2019s over so soon. They\u2019d had pretty much unprecedented tours of Berkeley and Stanford, which Peter had loved (though he didn\u2019t envy Peter of the future, having to pick one of all these colleges that\u2019d have him at the drop of a hat). </p><p>Then they\u2019d had a couple days just here and there, sightseeing and relaxing and eating good food, staying in a nice hotel in San Francisco that made Peter bounce on the balls of his feet in excitement at the luxury.\u00a0</p><p>Tony received a selfie off him in his bath tub, up to the eyeballs in bubbles and a champagne flute of orange juice in his hand.</p><p>A squirrel had tried to basically mug Peter of his pretzels in Golden Gate Park. Tony couldn\u2019t with 100% certainty guarantee that May hadn\u2019t been immediately sent a perfectly timed photo of the attack, or that she wasn\u2019t framing multiple copies at that very moment. God, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d laughed so hard.</p><p>Chuckling under his breath at the memory, he looks over at the kid, who\u2019s fast asleep beside him. His smile turns at the corners into a grimace when he sees the position Peter\u2019s in \u2013 slumped forward, his neck at a weird angle. </p><p>Peter had mentioned yesterday that his neck and jaw had been a bit stiff and sore. Tony had joked that he was probably sleeping on the ceiling <i>just because he could</i>, and that was why his neck was playing up.\u00a0</p><p>Peter had laughed, said something about taking a hit on patrol. From then on, Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice every time Peter rubbed his mouth or winced slightly at a movement, and had resolved to take the suit in for upgrades; starting with more head and neck support.<br></p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been bothering him too much, if the vigour with which he took up the role of slack-jawed tourist was anything to go by.</p><p>Well, at least he didn\u2019t have to worry about <i>why</i> the kid\u2019s healing factor wasn\u2019t fixing up the injury \u2013 sleep like <i>that</i> and it was no wonder his neck was all strained.\u00a0</p><p>He looks like some kind of creepy contortionist, head flopped forward and twisted towards the window. He\u2019s only restrained by the seatbelt \u2013 otherwise he\u2019d be faceplanting the dash for sure. </p><p>Boy, was he out of it. Had he maybe overdone it with the touristy things?</p><p><i>Nah. </i></p><p>Kid loved it. </p><p>\u201cSomeone gets you in one spot for longer than 30 seconds one time and you pull a Sleeping Beauty.\u201d He softly grouses. Peter\u2019s knowledge of good health habits \u2013 namely that you <i>actually have to sleep every once in a blue moon</i> \u2013 is shockingly poor for a kid genius. He focuses back on the road for a split second before his head whips back. \u201cI only called you Beauty to get the reference right. It\u2019s not a compliment. Don\u2019t get cocky.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t stir. Tony sighs, leaning over to push him back against the seat with one hand against his chest. Once he\u2019s there and the seatbelt is more lax, he tries to ease his head back a little, withdrawing suddenly, fingers curling at the surprise heat he finds on Peter\u2019s brow. </p><p>He coughs under his breath, confusion spreading under his features. He corrects the car\u2019s course an inch to the left, thankful they\u2019re on a straight, almost empty highway, and presses his entire hand to Peter\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201c<i>El scorchio.</i> Peter? Hey, Parker, rise and shine.\u201d He shakes Peter\u2019s shoulder whilst staring at the road, awkwardness now for some reason filling up inside him. </p><p>Peter grunts. \u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up.\u201d He exhales long and slow out of his nose and rubs his eyes and neck, hissing at the latter like Tony had expected him to.</p><p>He squeezes one eye shut and twists his features to the left as he pointlessly tries to inspect his neck. He must agitate his sore jaw doing this, because he hisses again. Tony stares ahead at the road. </p><p>\u201cAw man. I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep. Sorry, Mr Stark.\u201d He says. \u201cAre we stopping or didja just miss me?\u201d He taunts.</p><p>Tony plays with words in his mouth. Peter sounds okay, has enough in him to make fun\u2026</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d do a number on your neck if I let you sleep like that any longer. I\u2019m sure your aunt would have a thing or two to say about that. You alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad.\u201d</p><p><i>Sure. And since we\u2019re playing make-believe, I\u2019m late for my date with the Tooth Fairy, so if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026</i></p><p>Peter pulls his hoodie off. He balls it up and hugs it to him, his socked feet up on the seat. Tony makes a cursory glance at him, and catches his eye. He smiles. Peter smiles back \u2013 his eyes are tired. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop in about half an hour. You can go back to sleep if you want, I\u2019m fine with the radio.\u201d</p><p>Peter turns on the radio. \u201cNah. I\u2019ve left you on your own \u2013 which, by the way, Ms Potts told me <i>never</i> to do \u2013 for like, half an hour already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I know y\u2014<i>two hours</i>?\u201d</p><p>Tony snorts and nods. \u201cAaa<i>yup</i>. Did an excellent corpse impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr <i>Stark</i>!\u201d Peter whines, cracking his window open and sticking his fingers out. \u201cYou shoulda woke me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, think you\u2019ll find I <i>did</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m nothing if not a generous man.\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t rebut the statement, and Tony promptly files it away under <i>Jokes That Fall Flat Because The Kid Still Thinks I\u2019m a Good Person</i>. \u201cAnd I thought I\u2019d better leave you to your fever-\u201c he shoots him a wilting look, \u201cand all. But yeah, you know, it\u2019s chill. It\u2019s cool. Well, you\u2019re not chill or cool. Because of the fever. Hey, look at that! I made a funny.\u201d</p><p>Peter is glaring at him, but with no heat behind it. \u201cI get warm when I sleep, and I had this on.\u201d He gestures to the hoodie. Tony sighs.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Mr Stark, I feel fine.\u201d</p><p>Tony relents. \u201cYou wanna put one of your playlists on?\u201d</p><p>Peter grins. </p><hr><p>They stop for food. Peter gets a grilled cheese and strawberry milkshake. Tony watches him with reserved concern whenever he\u2019s not looking. </p><p>The kid\u2019s still bubbly and happy and warm - still <i>warm</i> warm, too. Tony sneakily checked by messing up Peter\u2019s hair like he hates him doing \u2013 but he is a little quieter.</p><p>He definitely doesn\u2019t inhale his food like he normally does, or order seconds like he normally does, and when Tony orders <i>himself</i> seconds, he excuses himself to the bathroom.</p><p>Tony eats the onion rings first in the couple minutes he\u2019s gone. He has his suspicions that the strong smell wasn\u2019t agreeing with the kid.</p><p>And, as always, his jaw\u2019s bothering him. Neck, too. </p><p>Watching him eat with exaggerated care and obvious pain is driving Tony\u2019s blood pressure through the damn roof.</p><p>They\u2019re back on the road now, have been for about 4 hours. </p><p>Tony listens to the classical station on low volume, the local news on medium, the rock station on almost mute. He ends up shutting it all off.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t plan on stopping till 2 or 3am; however long it takes to get to their hotel checkpoint. It just makes sense to drive till late, when it\u2019s quiet, then sleep in to miss the early morning traffic, have a late breakfast and do the same again. </p><p>He\u2019ll stop if Peter asks, but otherwise, he\u2019s good. </p><p>The quiet \u2013 Peter\u2019s obviously out cold once again \u2013 is actually nice. It\u2019s not heavy and oppressive, like he can find quiet to be. It\u2019s just steady. He\u2019s thinking about things without feeling overwhelmed. He can just drive and think and think and drive.</p><p>And keep an eye on the kid. </p><p>He shifts in his sleep, head now pillowed against the window with Tony\u2019s jacket, and hoodie still bunched up in his arms, hugged to his waist.</p><p>It\u2019s only 9pm right now, and he\u2019s wondering whether to push it till 10:30 or maybe 11. Six hours is a long time to drive non-stop, but he\u2019s not really hungry from his huge lunch, and he doesn\u2019t need the bathroom. </p><p>It all depends on Peter. If he stays asleep, he guesses he could just keep driving. </p><p>He\u2019s only a couple minutes into that resolution when Peter does wake. </p><p>\u201cEvening.\u201d He says softly. \u201cHow d\u2019you feel?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flutter shut again and he offers only a small smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d He doesn\u2019t move. Tony\u2019s too smart to know it\u2019s not because the position is too comfortable to relinquish. </p><p>He knows it\u2019s because any movement will jar and pain him. </p><p>He\u2019d offer him painkillers, but the kid\u2019s already refused them twice today. God, what can he do? Maybe he should take him on a spa day or something.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Pete. I wasn\u2019t gonna stop for a little while, but we can if you need to.\u201d </p><p>Peter flaps a hand at him. \u201cI\u2019m good. Maybe in, like, an hour?\u201d </p><p>Tony nods. \u201cSure thing. Hey, I was thinking. D\u2019you think you\u2019ve got a bad case of whiplash or something? Because you\u2019re flipping around Queens all day and I haven\u2019t put all that much reinforcement in the neck of the suit.\u201d</p><p>Peter eyes him and what looks like relief floods his features. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah? Gimme the suit when we\u2019re back. I\u2019ll work on that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf <i>course.</i> You think I\u2019m gonna let you let me do all the work for you?\u201d </p><p>Peter breathes out a laugh that turns into a more forced exhale when he moves to sit up straight. He leans forward tentatively, head in his hands. Tony\u2019s jacket slips down from the window into his lap and he digs a hand into it.</p><p>Tony balks. He can\u2019t reach for him, the road around them is busy. \u201cHey, hey, hey. Easy. What\u2019s wrong, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019okay. Just got sorta dizzy.\u201d Peter says, not moving from his position. \u201cI thought\u2014it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d Tony pulls up into gravel of the shoulder as gently as possible. He undoes both his and Peter\u2019s seatbelts. </p><p>He hesitates over what to do now he has his hands free and settles on rubbing a hand up and down Peter\u2019s lower back. \u201cStay like that if it helps, Peter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThought I might pass out.\u201d </p><p>Tony feels Peter\u2019s cheek with the back of his hand. It\u2019s clammy. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Mr Stark. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He murmurs. \u201cJust a headache. Not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I was asleep for too long?\u201d Tony doesn\u2019t fail to notice that Peter\u2019s voice is a little bit croaky. \u201cIn one position.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s insides twist. That isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>Peter breathes. Tony looks up the nearest hotel, motel, truck stop, anything, and finds a motel a couple miles down the road. Peter tries to argue against it, so Tony just lies and says he\u2019s tired too.</p><p>The guy at the desk is nice. He\u2019s a huge, broad guy, with an impressive dark beard that Tony compliments the second he enters the reception. </p><p>He apologises profusely that they only have one room free, and it\u2019s a king. Tony insists it\u2019s fine. He wouldn\u2019t care if it were a shack that was $1,000,000/h: as long as it was clean and Peter got to lie down, he couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Peter, poor kid, must have held a similar kind of ethics for the situation, since he only argued with Tony for 5 minutes about who got the bed (\u201c<i>But Mr Stark, you\u2019re driving. And paying. You\u2019re already stopping for me. I like sleeping on couches.</i>\u201d \u201c<i>Not a chance in absolute hell, kid. Here\u2019s your pyjamas.\u201d</i>) before he fell into it face first and dead to the world.</p><p>The motel wasn\u2019t bad. It wasn\u2019t anything like the place Tony had originally booked for tonight, but it wasn\u2019t grimy or falling apart at the seams either. </p><p>It has clean sheets, a hot shower, a decent coffee machine, and a separate light for the kitchenette that means Tony can keep the room dim but still get some work done at the table. </p><p>He sits back and stares at the papers. This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d expected to spend his evening. To be fair to Pepper \u2013 and he rarely was \u2013 she\u2019d be ecstatic that he was finally getting down to some business.</p><p>But, if he was <i>totally</i> honest, he\u2019d been looking forward to a repeat of the journey here: he and Peter\u2019d had a fun time. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fault. The kid probably already felt guilty for the fact that he\u2019d altered their plans \u2013 even if he couldn\u2019t help it. </p><p>He resolves to make<i> sure </i>Peter knew he wasn\u2019t mad at him when he was feeling better. He hopes that\u2019d be tomorrow morning, what with Peter\u2019s healing factor. He had to admit that although they didn\u2019t spend every waking moment together, he\u2019d never seen Peter sick. It made him more than a little uncomfortable.</p><p><i>Oh well</i>. He picks up his pen and sighs. <i>No time like the present.</i></p><hr><p>He eventually goes to the couch and gets a few hours shuteye. He sleeps till 3:45am, which isn\u2019t too bad, all things considered. It\u2019s about the limit of what he can get right now, what with the nightmares and the insomnia. </p><p>And a distinct lack of Pepper by his side.</p><p>Heaving himself up, he flips on the small lamp by the couch. Peter\u2019s still out of it, but his face has less lines than before. </p><p>Tony smiles. The kid\u2019s face has definitely regained more colour. </p><p>He picks up discarded items of clothing as he heads for the coffeemaker, folding them and placing them back on top of Peter\u2019s bag. As he drops them down, he notices the kid\u2019s phone screen light up at him. It\u2019s on 12%, and Tony\u2019s has a pet peeve for low batteries. He plugs it in on the nightstand and flips it onto silent.</p><p>Sitting back at the table, he mulls over the situation. </p><p>For starters, he\u2019s never seen Peter willingly sleep so much. He must be feeling really crappy to have slept for\u2026 what? It\u2019s gotta be <i>well </i>over 12 hours now. </p><p>For what Tony liked to call \u201cseconders\u201d (to piss Rhodey off), he had to admit to his paranoid, panicking brain that \u201cwillingly\u201d was the operative word when he\u2019d said he\u2019d never seen Peter sleep that much. He <i>had </i>seen Peter sleep that much.</p><p>It just\u2026 wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 with his consent? </p><p>The handful of times he\u2019d been injured as Spider-Man, his healing factor had forced him to sort of\u2026 hibernate so it could focus on repairing his body. Tony hoped to god that it was what was happening here.</p><p>For nexters, although the seconders answered one question, it raised another: if it was his enhanced healing, why wasn\u2019t it patching up his neck?</p><p>He would\u2019ve gone for a home run with <i>for lasters</i>, but he\u2019d been sitting and staring at the kid for so long, and the kid had been dead still the entire time. Which, for Peter Parker, sleeptalker extraordinaire, was weird. <i>Weird.</i></p><p>Peter was an active sleeper, to say the least. He was almost as hyper in sleep as he was awake (which embarrassed him to no end). He was always talking, laughing \u2013 which was <i>super</i> creepy, can he just say for the record \u2013 tossing and turning and ending up at the other end of the bed, or even slipping off the couch if there wasn\u2019t someone there to nudge him back on. Kid could sleep through a hurricane if it weren\u2019t for his Spidey sense.</p><p>But now\u2026 now Peter\u2019s in the centre of the bed, the <i>hogger,</i> comforter wrapped tight around his neck, and silent. When Tony comes closer, he sees that the kid\u2019s sweating. </p><p>He groans under his breath. </p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d he says, only half-hoping he\u2019d wake until he feels the same warmth amidst Peter\u2019s curls. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>Peter stirs lethargically. He goes to turn his head towards Tony, eyes closed, but they squint further shut in pain when his neck protests. \u201cHey, time s\u2019it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLate.\u201d Tony answers honestly, softly. </p><p>He feels awkward standing by the kid\u2019s bedside, but now he\u2019s up close, he\u2019s bordering dangerously on concern for Peter\u2019s wax-candle paleness and body temperature. \u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter is a terrible liar - <i>especially</i> when bleary from sleep. Tony knows this before he even speaks, from the convulsive swallow and the soft, surprised gasp of pain that follows it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, man, I\u2019m good. We leaving? I can just\u2014\u201d he swallows again and <i>does this kid really think I\u2019m not seeing this?</i> and rubs at his neck, \u201c\u2014can just grab a quick shower and I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He begins coordinating his limbs into movement. Tony holds him down by his shoulder, and Peter squeaks a protesting <i>hey!</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. You\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d Peter croaks, eyes already starting to slip shut again. \u201cI jus\u2019 woke up. Gimme a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-<i>huh</i>.\u201d He turns towards the kitchen and fills a glass of water, making sure it\u2019s cool but not ice-cold.</p><p>Peter watches him with an adorable suspicion that Tony pretends not to notice, and one eye cracked open.</p><p>\u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete.\u201d He cuts in, although gently. \u201cI\u2019m a hair\u2019s width from asking Hagrid at reception for a thermometer.\u201d Peter smiles slightly at the reference. He accepts the glass. \u201cGood call, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Whilst he drinks, Tony turns away again and heads to the couch, where he flips open his duffel and unzips the back pocket. </p><p>He rummages around, humming an <i>ah-ha!</i> as he pulls out some painkillers and shakes the pot by his ear. He grimaces when he hears what could only be a couple pills rattling around inside.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t be enough for him.</p><p>He went back to Peter, who was struggling back the water. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d He takes the glass off him and sets it aside. Peter looks relieved. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough meds for a superkid right now. D\u2019you want me to run to the store,\u201d<i> which is probably 20 miles away,</i> \u201cand grab some? And you\u2019ve got to be honest with me here. Seriously. I know your neck\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, it\u2019s fine, Mr Stark, honestly! I\u2019m fine. Store\u2019s probably like thirty miles away anyway. I\u2019ve had worse. Just needs sleeping off.\u201d Peter rushes to reassure, his voice thin and wispy.</p><p>Tony hesitates. \u201cOkay.\u201d He murmurs. \u201cYou know, you look like shit, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what all the girls say.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t quite believe that, somehow.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiles back. \u201cWe\u2019re not all womanizers like you, Mr Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow very dare you. I\u2019ll tell Miss Potts that when I see her, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Peter smirks. Long gone were the days when he was nervous of Pepper, and anxious to please - the days when Tony\u2019s joking threats like that were taken as gospel. </p><p>He inhales deeply, as though about to yawn, and Tony takes that as his cue to move away back to his makeshift office, when Peter yelps in shock. He shifts back around to see the kid with his mouth hanging half open, hands probing his jaw desperately.</p><p>He\u2019d have made a joke about the wind changing if he had a little less tact.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d He comes to sit on the bed, taking his hands calmly and moving them away. Peter barely allows his ministrations, his groan coming out more guttural and unsettling since his mouth was open. He rolls onto his back so Tony can see better. He winces when Tony\u2019s fingers brush against his face. \u201cHey, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019m just taking a quick look. No surprises.\u201d</p><p>Tony takes his chin in his right hand as carefully as he can. Peter\u2019s mouth is almost shut, his teeth bared like they usually would be mid-yawn. They couldn\u2019t have been more than an inch apart, his mouth more a rectangle than an <i>O.</i></p><p>He was gasping at the back of his throat, eyes roaming over Tony in question. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, easy. You\u2019ve probably just clenched it too hard in your sleep and it\u2019s locked. It\u2019s happened to me before.\u201d Peter tries to nod in Tony\u2019s hold. </p><p>Tony takes his hot face more firmly in his hands and runs his thumbs in circles along the highest point of his jaw bone, the bases of his palms just above the wrist cushioning his chin. \u201cStop me if this hurts too much, alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a <i>nuh-uh</i> sound in response. Tony takes it as reassurance that what he\u2019s doing is actually helping. </p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He says again and again, his brow furrowed and face calculating as he searches Peter\u2019s face for any signs of new pain or discomfort. \u201cI know it hurts, but it\u2019s helping. Promise. I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d He jokes. Peter\u2019s eyes shine for a moment, then dull back into his <i>This Hurts But I\u2019m Not One to Complain</i> calibre of Brave Face.</p><p>Slowly, <i>slowly,</i> the pain implicit in the kid\u2019s features recedes, and his jaw eases back to being closed. Tony smoothes over the grooves of his bone structure in inspection. He isn\u2019t sure whether it was fully better or not.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna try opening?\u201d</p><p>Peter twitches it from side to side like he\u2019s swishing mouthwash.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he tries, in a croak. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot better. Thanks, Mr Stark. Really. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles softly. He hopes that the disquiet in his head wasn\u2019t showing on his face. <i>What the hell is wrong with this kid?</i></p><p>\u201cJeez, that was actually kind of embarrassing.\u201d Peter says slowly, working his jaw out with each word. He rubs his cheek, which was blushing beneath his touch. \u201cThat\u2019s some pretty good ammo to use against me, me sitting here like a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a fish?\u201d Tony chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like a\u2014\u201d Peter makes a stupid face, puffing his cheeks and lazily circling his lips. \u201c\u2014a\u2014a fish.\u201d </p><p>His eyes narrow in affection. \u201cSure.\u201d He huffs a quick laugh out of his nose.</p><p>Peter was covering for how the pain he was feeling right now \u2013 he knows that \u2013 and Tony doesn\u2019t want to break the light atmosphere between them by pointing it out.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, that hurt, but\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s feeling better now though.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Better\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018It doesn\u2019t hurt at all\u2019. </i>\u201cAnything else hurt?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t reply. His forced swallow answers for him. Face a picture of exasperation, Tony\u2019s eyes widen as his eyebrows practically hit his hairline, head cocking to the side in an entirely too paternal show of anticipation of <i>the truth.</i></p><p>Peter reads his expression. He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>Tony purses his lips, eyes blinking slowly and chin retracting into his neck as he stares into space. Sarcasm laces his every movement. <i>Say that one more time, and I swear to god\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you think that <i>\u2018I\u2019ve had worse\u2019</i> somehow placates me. At all. Ha ha. You\u2019re actually very amusing, Peter, has anyone ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes slide shut, deflating. \u201cI\u2019m only telling you the truth. Truth hurts sometimes.\u201d His voice held the quality of someone trying not to fall asleep in a second flat. When he speaks again, he\u2019s somehow mustered a sombre tone that provokes Tony into almost believing him. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m okay. Just my neck and my throat hurt. And my jaw. And just a little headache. But, it\u2019s like\u2014localised? So it\u2019s okay. I took a hard hit round there on patrol, the other night. And the whiplash thing that you said. Think that. It\u2019s not that bad. Really, s\u2019all good.\u201d </p><p> \u201cSure. And what about the fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI run hot, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve got the flu, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>He almost hits the roof in surprise when that doesn\u2019t make Peter \u00a0immediately rise up in debate. \u201cMaybe. Be gone tomorrow. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sorries. Only getting betters.\u201d Tony places a cool hand over Peter\u2019s jaw again, presses lightly.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019okay.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, he nods slowly. It\u2019s clear Peter has a high tolerance for pain, and a low tolerance for being worried about. If the kid said he was okay, he had to believe him and leave him, he guessed. </p><p>He makes Peter finish the water, even though it seems to really hurt his throat, and refills it. He puts it within arms reach and opens all the windows. </p><p>Then he gets one of the washcloths from the bathroom and soaks it through. He puts it on Peter\u2019s forehead and leaves it there. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if it gets worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019f course, M\u2019st\u2019r Stark.\u201d Peter curls back onto his side, washcloth sliding down so it\u2019s propped up between his bangs and the quickly soaking pillow. Tony counts it as a win if it\u2019s still touching his skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay, kid.\u201d He pats Peter\u2019s leg \u2013 who he was sure had already passed right out - and goes back to his sketchpads and plans.</p><p>He\u2019s shifted some papers aside and is just opening his laptop to try Googling the kid\u2019s symptoms for some semblance of understanding \u2013 of what the hell might be going on, of how to help the kid (<i>of why his super healing hadn\u2019t kicked in to fix a simple knock to the larynx, and then he gets the flu, for god\u2019s sake, it\u2019s stressing me out</i>) when a quiet but indignant, croaking question rises up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be sleeping? It\u2019s <i>late</i>.\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts. \u201cToo many questions from an inquisitive Spiderling for one day. Go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked <i>one</i> question.\u201d Peter mumbles into his pillow. </p><p>Tony tastes the <i>I\u2019m fine</i> on his tongue and almost laughs at his hypocrisy. He sighs, shutting his laptop. \u201cFinding the concept of sleep a little difficult to grasp at present, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried list\u2019ning to\u2026 like\u2026 rain?\u201d </p><p>Tony smirks at the &gt;90% unconscious teen on the bed. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He watches the kid, who, with his eyes closed, runs his fingers along the charger till they meet his phone, fumbles a couple times to unlock it, and swipes to a white noise app. \u201cS\u2019\u2026good. Helps me sleep, y\u2019know?\u201d </p><p>Heavy rain and the gush of ocean surf fill the room. Peter tucks his phone beneath his pillow, giving the sound a round, enclosed property that makes it all the more calming. </p><p><i>It helps him block everything else out. </i></p><p><i>Everything\u2019s dialled to 11. </i></p><p>\u201cY\u2019should sleep, you know, Mis\u2019r Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete. Fine. I\u2019m gonna.\u201d</p><p>He mostly lies down on the couch to appease the kid.</p><p>He mostly falls <i>asleep</i> because of the rainy lull that envelopes the room and the echo of <i>it\u2019s not that bad</i> that\u2019s running around his head.</p><p>He wakes to Peter calling his name.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark? I\u2014 <i>ah</i>\u2014\u201d A gasp.</p><p>He pauses for a split second, checking to make sure he didn\u2019t imagine it, then sits bolt upright. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark,\u201d he sounds breathless. Tony reaches for the lamp. </p><p>Illumination billows into the room like smoke and he feels his pupils constrict. His eyes go straight to the kid sitting on the floor, knees drawn up. \u201c<i>Peter?</i>\u201d</p><p>Well, whaddya know?<i> It </i>is<i> that bad.</i></p><p>He crouches before him and wraps a hand around a trembling bicep. That arm is cradling his stomach.</p><p>The other is held awkwardly aloft \u2013 it\u2019s bent so that his elbow is pointing to the ceiling. His face is pressed into the crook of it, and his hand pushes into his neck like he\u2019s desperately trying to alleviate pressure, clawing at it like he\u2019s in agony.</p><p>His face is scrunched up, and he\u2019s breathing harsh and heavy.</p><p>Tony pushes a hand up onto his cheek. \u201cHey. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter just gasps. </p><p>\u201cPete? You\u2019re scaring me here, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 move. I can\u2019t move.\u201d Is forced out through ground teeth.</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach pits. <i>What is this?</i></p><p>Some kind of parasite? Is he going through <i>paralysis? </i></p><p><i>Oh, god. He hoped not.</i></p><p>He schools his features and grabs<i> Initiative</i> firmly by the throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Alright, Peter, where does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes on his breath. \u201c<i>Everywhere</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods, shifts the leg that held his weight. \u201cYeah, I figured. Okay, bud, I\u2019m going to move you real slow, okay? I need you lying down, because I\u2019m very conscious of you passing out right about now. I\u2019ll do the work, okay? Don\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d </p><p>It was like untangling a fierce knot. Tony knew he couldn\u2019t help it. Peter\u2019s super-strength fights against every small touch, and he\u2019s very close to crying - and not stopping. Tony could sense it in his breathing, in his face, in his jarred swallowing. He could literally sense it like a balmy air threatening rain. It was the worst feeling.</p><p>He starts by straightening one of his legs, wanting to put off moving his arms for as long as possible. Now with room in front of him, Peter slowly leans forward to be against Tony. Tony swallows hard and rubs his back. </p><p><i>Do I move him or not? God, do I </i>move him or not?!</p><p>Peter decides for him.</p><p>\u201cI can stand.\u201d He grinds out. Tony doesn\u2019t argue with him. His hands hover over his back as he heaves himself up and sits back on the bed. </p><p>Once he\u2019s down, and his arms are no longer raised, Tony crouches by his head. He squints at him till they have eye contact. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look good, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives him the saddest of small smiles. Tears are pricking at his tear ducts, and the smile drops. He looks like a little kid. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know. But we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d </p><p>Up close, Peter smells of sweat and the same floral detergent that their entire apartment smells like. Tony thinks of May, and what she\u2019d do. </p><p>Peter\u2019s trembling. He\u2019s paler than a sheet and his voice is little more than a crackle. He\u2019s burning up, and Tony knows that everything above his shoulders is pure agony. </p><p>Something flashes through his mind, a possible diagnosis that rings a bell when the words<i> lockjaw</i> and <i>stiff neck</i> and <i>fever</i> go together, but he shakes his head. Peter\u2019s been vaccinated. May <i>is</i> not,<i> was</i> not, never was and never will be, an anti-vaxxer. He knows that for certain. </p><p><i>But it looks so much like\u2026</i></p><p>Peter groans, eyes glassy. He shuts them and Tony tangles his fingers in his hair and massages his scalp. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, bud.\u201d</p><p>He knows what he has to do. </p><p>Happy picks up on the 11th ring. His disgruntled nature is thrown off when Tony tells him he needs a private jet or chopper or something as soon as possible, as close as possible to his current location. He texts him his co-ordinates and waits for a text back with his ETA.</p><p>3 hours. And he\u2019s bringing Bruce.</p><p>3 hours till medical attention. Around 6 hours till they\u2019re back at the compound. He looks at Peter desperately. He\u2019s tingling all over with adrenaline and fear. He could literally see the kid going downhill.</p><p>The nearest hospital\u2019s much farther than 3 fucking hours. He\u2019d made FRIDAY look into getting something directly to the hospital \u2013 a medical chopper, or something, he didn\u2019t know. Turned out to be 5 hour round trip so he sticks with Bruce and Happy, and a jet with a full medsuite available.</p><p>So they\u2019re stranded till then. </p><p>Things just always seemed to work out that way, didn\u2019t they?</p><p>He sits on the bed beside Peter and holds his hand. Peter squeezes it in what Tony can\u2019t decide is a coping mechanism for the pain, or meant to calm him down until he numbly realises it\u2019s probably both.</p><p>\u201cPeter? I need you to hold on, okay? I\u2019m getting you help. I think\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m really sorry. But you\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Peter gasps. He\u2019s speaking slowly, from the pain in his jaw, and Tony can\u2019t help but let the scary diagnosis word hurl itself against the padded walls of his Crazy House mind over and over.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet.</p><p>They both have their self-prescribed tasks: Tony rubs his thumb over Peter\u2019s knuckles and watches his phone like a hawk. Peter tries to suck it up and swallows back groans and whimpers like there\u2019s no tomorrow. He doesn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Well. </p><p>It <i>is</i> quiet, till Peter speaks.</p><p>He speaks calmly. Matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cMy stomach hurts.\u201d </p><p>Tony straightens, all unsure and nervous. \u201cOkay. Alright. Can I\u2014can I take a look?\u201d </p><p>He raises his pyjama top and rubs his hands together till they\u2019re warm. Peter still sucks in a breath when they make contact.</p><p>He gently \u2013 god, he could not be more gentle if he tried, and it\u2019s still hurting him, <i>he\u2019s</i> still hurting him \u2013 palpates his stomach, and both of them gasp at the same time.</p><p>It\u2019s hard as rock. </p><p>He looks at Peter, fear and definite realisation dawning on him. His heart sinks, thudding in fear for the kid. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Peter rasps. Now his hand\u2019s free from Tony\u2019s hold, it joins his other limbs in sliding sluggishly against the comforter in pain and discomfort as he rides out another wave of flashing cramps. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p>Tony shakes his head and lowers his shirt. He takes back Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cNothing. You\u2019re okay. It\u2019s alright.\u201d He says fruitlessly. He feels so stupid. He doesn\u2019t know what to do!</p><p>\u201cMr Stark?\u201d</p><p>Tony turns and palms Peter\u2019s face, hoping Peter\u2019s going to ask him to do something for him, to give him <i>something</i> to do to help. \u201cKid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna throw up.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s sitting up and heaving and crying before Tony can grab the trash can, and suddenly he has a sobbing kid covered in vomit and their only bed faring not much better. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s <i>really</i> crying now. He\u2019s holding his stomach and bent over it as much as his neck will allow. </p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNot your fault, Underoos. Not at all. Don\u2019t you worry about it. My job.\u201d He reassures, as warmly as he can. \u201cYou got more?\u201d </p><p>Peter says no. He laughs once. Tony isn\u2019t sure why he laughs, but it\u2019s completely devoid of humour anyway and then rapidly followed by a breathy groan when his jaw disagrees with the action. </p><p>\u201cMaybe talking isn\u2019t a good idea right now, huh, buddy?\u201d Tony suggests, not unkindly. \u201cI would tell you to nod, but uh\u2026\u201d </p><p>Peter settles for the thumbs up/down approach.</p><p>Tony helps him shift so his back\u2019s against the headboard, wedging a pillow between his neck and shoulders so he feels as little pain as possible. </p><p>He strips the comforter from beneath him \u2013 it hasn\u2019t soaked through, thankfully \u00a0- and throws it into the corner. He replaces it with his blanket from the couch. </p><p>Then he finds the washcloth and fills up a bowl of warm water. He cleans up Peter\u2019s face, wiping at the sick and tears and sweat with no sarcastic comment, only soft reassurances.</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression is a mixture of mortified and miserable. He\u2019s still shaking, and once Tony\u2019s eased off his shirt \u2013 something that makes Peter cry out despite his best efforts not to \u2013 he replaces it with one of his own sleep shirts and Peter\u2019s hoodie. </p><p>The pants are a different matter. Peter\u2019s eyes are closed, and he\u2019s breathing deeply like Tony\u2019s told him to. He can\u2019t leave the kid in them, but he doesn\u2019t want to undress him when changing his shirt was the <i>Worst Moment of his Life So Far,</i> according to the kid\u2019s expression. </p><p>He\u2019s giving him a breather from the movement when he notices Peter\u2019s jaw is locked again, and it\u2019s stuck in this sinister sort-of grin that Tony can hardly look at. He does the massaging like he did before until Peter\u2019s mouth is shut. As it closes, he groans loudly and it dissolves into a grimaced set of sobs. </p><p>His eyes are squeezed shut and he knows the kid wants nothing more than to arch his back and neck like he does when he\u2019s hurting, but he can\u2019t. It damn near breaks Tony\u2019s heart.</p><p>He waits for him to open his eyes again, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cUm. Pete?\u201d Peter opens his eyes slowly. \u201cHi. Only me. Uh\u2026 hate to say this, but we\u2019re gonna have to change your pants, kiddo.\u201d He groans. \u201c\u2014I know, I know, Pete. I\u2019m sorry. But I can\u2019t let you sit in it. Your aunt would kill me.\u201d</p><p>Peter uses the hand that isn\u2019t clutching his stomach to give a shaky and reluctant thumbs-up.</p><p>He finds a fresh pair of underwear and a pair of sweats in Peter\u2019s bag and brings them over. Peter swallows forcefully.</p><p>\u201cAaaalrighty. How d\u2019you wanna do this?\u201d </p><p>Peter edges to the edge of the bed, Tony catching on quickly. He wavers, but does manage stay up of his own steam. Tony knows it\u2019s agony for him. \u201cShut your eyes.\u201d He croaks from behind his teeth. </p><p>Tony rolls them, instead. He has one grounding hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPeter, it\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cShut.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know whether that meant <i>shut up</i> or <i>shut your eyes so help me god</i>, but he decides he may as well do both. He\u2019s desperate for Peter to lay down again and though it may not seem like it with some of the pranks he pulls on the kid sometimes, he does give at least <i>half</i> a damn about his dignity. He still has his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder, he figures, so it can\u2019t go too badly wrong.</p><p>Well.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019s S\u2019ark.\u201d </p><p>Tony opens his eyes. Peter\u2019s in his new boxers, but the sweats are on the carpet. He\u2019s looking decidedly <i>worse</i> than ever, and Tony has to stoop and wrap his arms round him for fear of him fainting.</p><p>Peter\u2019s drooling. Tony idly hopes it\u2019s from the lack of movement in his jaw and not because he\u2019s about to toss his cookies again. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 look.\u201d He whispers.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNot looking.\u201d</p><p>Peter whines softly into his shoulder. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>Tony hushes him, at a complete loss of what to do or say or be. It\u2019s hurting him, too. \u201cWhat can I do, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>His stomach pitches in affection and raw concern. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere, buddy. I\u2019ve invested too much money in you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t laugh. In fact, he doesn\u2019t react at all. His breathing\u2019s calmed, he\u2019s leaning all the more heavier into Tony, and it doesn\u2019t take a genius to knows he\u2019s passed out. </p><p>So he panics.</p><p>He panics, laying him back down and checking his pulse on his neck - \u00a0and then his wrist for good measure. It\u2019s there, strong and maybe a little fast, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s okay. </p><p>He\u2019s still breathing. He double checks that, too, and allows himself to relax. He\u2019s passed out from exertion. From pain, maybe, though he doubts it. Peter\u2019s taken a hell of a lot of pain before and been okay. This is a whole new level. </p><p>Something different.</p><p>Tetanus.</p><p>He\u2019s pretty sure. </p><p>He graciously as possible pulls Peter\u2019s sweats on and some socks after it. It feels a little too much like dressing a dead body for his liking, but he\u2019s checked Peter\u2019s breathing about five times now, and he is. </p><p>He texts Happy to go<i> faster</i> and brings his computer over. He looks up tetanus and frowns. </p><p>He spares the sleeping teen a look. \u201cYou had to go whole-hog, didn\u2019t you. Couldn\u2019t get a head cold like everyone else.\u201d</p><p><i>Fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate\u2026 \u00a0</i></p><p>His fingers rest on Peter\u2019s jumpy pulse point as he reads.</p><p><i>Facial spasms. Difficulty swallowing. Abdominal tenseness.</i></p><p><i>\u2026 can be fatal if not treated quickly.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>O</i>-kay. Yep. Uh-huh. That\u2019s enough of the scary stories.\u201d He slams the laptop shut and sits waiting for the silence to reply to him.</p><p>He checks his watch. Another hour and a half.</p><p>He wipes Peter\u2019s brow, makes sure the hoodie isn\u2019t too thick.</p><p>Paces a little, moves the trash can closer to the bed, carries on pacing. </p><p>All but runs to <i>actually</i> ask Hagrid for a thermometer. He doesn\u2019t have one, so he just grabs some ice from the machine and puts the bucket in the bathtub just in case. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll know when to use it but he feels better knowing it\u2019s there.</p><p>He paces again. Then he stands by the door and holds it open, looking for headlights. Then he paces again. </p><p>He stands with his hands in his pockets and stares at the kid, who\u2019s now stirred enough to reassure him he\u2019s not out cold anymore; though still not getting any kind of <i>peaceful</i> sleep. Bodily sighing, his swipes his foot over the carpet. The fibres flip over and he makes an infinity symbol pattern over and over with the midsole of his shoe. He\u2019s pleased that it took up 2 whole minutes \u2013 only 51 to go.</p><p>He wonders if he should wake him and make him drink some water.</p><p>He packs both their things up and puts the bags by the door. He paces just a little more because his feet are buzzing from inactivity.</p><p>He decides he <i>should</i> wake the kid. He decides against it. He decides against the deciding against it. He makes some coffee and doesn\u2019t drink any of it. </p><p>He wishes, and wishes, and wishes again he hadn\u2019t taken the kid on this trip.</p><p>He hopes to god he\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>Peter lets out a hushed, crackly, <i>heartbreaking </i>whine from the back of his throat. Tony re-wets the washcloth and moves the trash can a little closer. He sits and cups his cheek. It feels like a placebo method of willing his temperature down, but he\u2019ll take anything over feeling completely useless.</p><p>When his phone starts to ring with 32 minutes left, he almost jumps out of his skin. He drops Peter\u2019s hand and moves to the kitchenette to answer. \u201cGimme good news, Hogan.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cDriving to you now. How\u2019s he doing?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThank God. He\u2019s asleep. How long till you\u2019re here? Bruce there? Tell him it\u2019s tetanus. I mean\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s tetanus now. Though I\u2019m open alternative diagnoses. My pride can take the hit.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cJesus, Tony\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNavigation thing says 12 minutes. See you in 8. Yes, Bruce is here.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHolding you to 8. Drive safe. Drive fast.\u201d</p><p>7 minutes later, a dishevelled Bruce is jumping out of a blue Audi, dragging his medcase with him. Tony waves, and he jogs over. </p><p>\u201cHi, Tony.\u201d He says. Tony doesn\u2019t know how Bruce manages to sound apologetic in everything he says, but he can and does.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for coming.\u201d He ushers him in and Bruce heads straight for the bed. He gasps when he feels Peter\u2019s forehead, and he looks at Tony, an appalled look on his face. </p><p>\u201cPlease. Help him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Tony regales the entire story to Bruce as he inflates a blood pressure cuff and waits for his temperature to take. He doesn\u2019t look impressed when the readings come through onto a device he\u2019s holding.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Tetanus? Or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, tetanus or <i>not</i>, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s taking advantage of his enhanced state. I\u2019ve never seen something this serious advance so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what does that mean? Is he gonna recover quicker? Is he dying?\u201d Tony babbles. Bruce just shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Tony doesn\u2019t have the gall to ask which question he\u2019s answering. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re right. I\u2019m gonna give him the tetanus antitoxin and set up an IV now. He needs to be back on the jet.\u201d</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look away when the huge needle pierces his arm, or when the IV goes into his hand. He stands there, helpless and hapless and a complete fucking idiot who\u2019s going to let his kid die because he couldn\u2019t recognise tetanus if it slapped him in the face.</p><p>He <i>feels</i> like he\u2019s been slapped in the face.</p><p>\u201cCan you carry him?\u201d Bruce is looking at him like he\u2019s said this question already. Tony nods, gormless. Bruce nods back. \u201cI\u2019ve given him a short-acting barbiturate sedation to keep him out till the jet at least. This is going to hurt his neck, so be gentle, Tony, be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Tony is gentle. He hugs the kid to him for the entire tense car ride \u2013 Happy breaking the speed limit what feels like twice over, Bruce taking readings and feeling Peter\u2019s neck and jaw and stomach whilst holding an IV up in the air.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d have been able to breathe a sigh of relief when he got Peter onto the medbay bed, but he just\u2026 can\u2019t.</p><p>Can\u2019t breathe. </p><p>He watches wires and nurses swamp his kid from his freakout corner. They take his blood to look for anything else \u2013 though Bruce is almost adamant it\u2019s tetanus by now, and he\u2019s injecting Peter with needle after needle of antibiotics. They get to work on his jaw and neck, doing stuff that Tony has no idea how to explain.</p><p>They cut through his hoodie and place cooling gel packs on him. Tony shifts on his feet, because Peter really liked that old hoodie, and he knows his guilt will force him to trawl <i>eBay</i> for another lookalike till he finds another one for the poor kid.</p><p>It won\u2019t be the same. The lettering won\u2019t be faded and the drawstring won\u2019t be missing and it won\u2019t smell like the rest of May\u2019s laundry\u2014</p><p>May.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to call the kid\u2019s aunt.\u201d He murmurs to nobody in particular. He slips out of the room.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. Again, he\u2019s surprised to not be relieved at all. The <i>leave a message after the beep</i> beep beeps and he stares at the wall. </p><p>\u201cMay. It\u2019s me. I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could give me a call back as soon as you can. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>His screen lights up with her name a second later. </p><p><i>\u201cTony?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMay.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTony, what\u2019s happened? Are you okay? Is Peter?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAre you sitting down?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me. Tell me right now.\u201d</i></p><p>He gulps. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s not okay. He\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick? <i>Oh, my god. What\u2019s wrong with him? Can I speak to him?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 well, we\u2019re not 100% yet. Tests are coming back in soon. But we think\u2026 May, we think it\u2019s tetanus.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTetanus? Oh, my god. My poor baby. Tetanus? Tony, it can\u2019t be tetanus. I got him immunised. I\u2014I made sure he got all his boosters! He hasn\u2019t been bit by any feral animals or\u2014how do you even get it? What\u2019s happening to him? Where are you? I need to see my baby.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI believe you got him vaccinated. And it doesn\u2019t have to be through an animal bite. I don\u2019t really know how else, I only Googled it for a second. Dirt? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThe mud run\u2026\u201d</i> May breathes. Tony straightens. She\u2019s right.</p><p>Peter ran a charity mud run <i>twice</i> a few days ago. Once as Peter Parker, once as Spider-Man. The kid only needed one small cut, or to have accidentally ingested some of the dirt, and it\u2019d be straight to Tetanus Town. Especially with a healing factor like his \u2013 anything that got into a cut Peter had would be sealed in within the hour. </p><p>\u201cGod, I think you\u2019re right. FRIDAY, let Bruce know.\u201d He sits down on the edge of a plush seat. \u201cAnd he\u2019s asleep right now. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in any pain, at least.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s been in a lot of pain?\u201d</i> May asks quietly.</p><p>Tony steadies his hand by shoving it between his knees. \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t realise soon enough what was going on. It\u2019s my fault. His neck was hurting, and his jaw seized up at one point. He threw up on himself, and I\u2026 he had a dizzy spell, for god\u2019s sake, and I didn\u2019t <i>realise.</i>\u201d He only just holds back from saying <i>and now it might be too late.</i></p><p>May is silent. <i>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOn a jet back to the compound. I can send a car to pick you up when we\u2019re an hour out.\u201d He says. He can sense her anger at him, and he actually wants to see her so he can be chewed out.</p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can drive myself.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, May.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019m going to be getting any more <i>in loco parentis</i> opportunities anytime soon.\u201d He can\u2019t quite keep the self-reproach out of his deadpan tone.</p><p><i>\u201cTony. I know my nephew. I know what he\u2019s like. I know you look after him. You\u2019re on a private jet, are you not? I\u2019m assuming you cleaned up vomit from him, did you not? Tony, this wasn\u2019t your fault. Trust me. I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m just scared. I\u2019m\u2026 really in the dark here.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when Bruce knows more. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOkay. If he wakes up, tell him I love him and I\u2019ll be waiting for him when you land, okay?\u201d</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s heart twists. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t even hung up before Happy comes in, foregoing knocking. \u201cHe\u2019s coming round.\u201d</p><hr><p>Peter comes round all at once. He shouts out in agony, and Bruce leaps to dole out the analgesia. Tony cups his cheek instantly, blocking his eyes from roaming around the darkened room. \u201cHey. Look at me, kiddo. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re alright. Bruce is gonna help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s lip is trembling. A tear\u2019s path gets cut off by Tony\u2019s hand, and he uses his middle finger to wipe them away. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here, okay? Where you can see me.\u201d</p><p>Bruce nods at him. </p><p>\u201cNow, listen, Pete. We don\u2019t know how yet, but you\u2019ve contracted tetanus. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it in biology class. It\u2019s not fun, and I\u2019m really so sorry it\u2019s happened like this. But I <i>promise</i> you we\u2019re gonna get you better.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stands behind Peter\u2019s head, shaking a vial of something. He pauses when Tony doesn\u2019t continue and meets his eyes. <i>Tell him what I told you.</i></p><p>Tony looks down sadly. Peter\u2019s eyes are wide and bright from the tears and pain, watching him steadily.</p><p>\u201cI do promise you we\u2019ll fix this. But I also\u2026 I can\u2019t lie to you. It\u2019s not gonna be easy, Pete. You got the facial spasms, right? And your stomach hurt?\u201d He placed a gentle hand on Peter\u2019s stomach and rubbed as gently as possible. Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered shut. \u201cWell, now your jaw\u2019s locked into place. And it\u2019ll keep advancing till you\u2019re having these sort-of\u2026 god, Peter I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re gonna have these\u2026 Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Peter.\u201d Bruce moves into the frame of Peter\u2019s eyeline. \u201cWhat Tony\u2019s trying to say is that your muscles are going to go into spasm all over your body. It\u2019ll be like having a seizure. I\u2019m giving you as much pain relief as I can. It\u2019s\u2026 really not fun. Sorry, kid.\u201d</p><p>Tony takes his hand. \u201cPeter, how bad is the pain out of ten? Squeeze.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes ten times.</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart breaks into another million pieces with each weak clasp.</p><p>Bruce stares at him, waiting for a number. </p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, I\u2019m sorry Peter.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s somehow horrible to not hear Peter say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d </p><p>If he\u2019s honest, it\u2019s horrible not to hear anything at all. The balance is all off. He\u2019s never craved one of Peter\u2019s nerdy, trip-over-your-words rants more than right now.</p><p>Bruce ups the morphine dosage a little higher and goes about prepping the most effective diazepam formula for Peter\u2019s oncoming seizures. Tony carries on trying to calm him.</p><p>\u201cOh. And I talked to your aunt.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes fly open at that \u2013 Tony can see in them that if he could have, he\u2019d have asked about May. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there when we land. She told me to say \u2018I love you\u2019. Not me. Her. I don\u2019t love you. You know I\u2019ve always found you to be a chronic menace.\u201d Tony huffs a tired laugh and runs his hand through Peter\u2019s hair, leaving it there as a comforting gesture. Peter eyelids slide shut again.</p><p>The next three hours go about as smoothly as Tony had expected. </p><p>Peter graduates from a nasal cannula to a loud, invasive oxygen mask that he very clearly doesn\u2019t like. The second it\u2019s on, his hands are balling up and he\u2019s crying. One of them eventually fumbles for Tony\u2019s.</p><p>He ends up knowing every line and hair on them intimately, as it stays firmly grasped in his for the rest of the flight. If he loosens his grip, Peter\u2019s fingers flounder and the guilt swallows him whole.</p><p>The diazepam works well to slow down the body tremors for a while, but they really set off just as they\u2019re banking to land. </p><p>It\u2019s horrific. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes are open, darting around and terrified. His entire body seizes at once, his torso, arms and legs aggressively jerking inwards every second or so. It looks like some kind of demonic possession in a horror movie, and Tony wants nothing more than to look away. To just let it pass. He\u2019s <i>never </i>wanted something to end so much in his entire life. And he\u2019s been captured and tortured by terrorists. </p><p>But he\u2019s seen awful things before, and he likes to think he can handle anything like a mature adult. He\u2019s a superhero, for god\u2019s sake. He can do this.</p><p>Especially for Peter.</p><p>Peter\u2019s strong. He\u2019s stronger than Tony could ever be. </p><p>But\u2026 he\u2019s still a kid. And he\u2019s terrified, and he\u2019s in agony.</p><p>So he whispers to the kid, whether he can hear him or not, strokes his cheek, hums to him, cards his hand through his sweaty hair. </p><p>Bruce squeezes his shoulder as he rushes past. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Tony. Keep doing that, okay?\u201d</p><p>He cannot imagine the pain Peter\u2019s in. He asks for him to be sedated, but Bruce sadly explains that with Peter\u2019s enhanced state, they need him awake. They don\u2019t know how fast this thing is gonna progress, and they need to monitor his alertness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re landing now, buddy. Not too long. Get you down to the compound and get you fixed right up. Be back to doing backflips off the Empire State and scaring the hell out of me in no time.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes his hand hard in between jolts. \u201cI know, Pete. I know.\u201d</p><hr><p>May goes almost\u2026 <i>green</i> when she sees Peter. They\u2019re pushing him on the stretcher into the med bay, which she\u2019s sat outside of, ripping up an old receipt into little pieces that fall into her purse.</p><p>Peter\u2019s whole body is jolting again and again and again like he\u2019s being electrocuted and there are wires going everywhere, and the big scary oxygen mask dwarfs his face. He\u2019s making a broken keening sound in the back of his throat, which heightens when Tony reluctantly lets go of his hand to give the team room to work around him. They disappear through the medbay doors, one of them requesting they give them some time to stabilise him.</p><p>May is frozen, standing there with her purse on the ground. Pieces of receipt are scattered everywhere.</p><p>Her head turns and she stares at him with big eyes. </p><p>She looks worn ragged with worry. </p><p>Tony guesses he doesn\u2019t look much different.</p><p>\u201cHe just started going downhill\u2026\u201d he supplies uselessly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him?\u201d </p><p>Tony just looks back at her. May is the kind of woman whose entire composure begs you not to fuck with her. Or lie to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Hopefully get better.\u201d He feels the last word come out as an empty laugh, and he drops down into one of the chairs, head in hands. His neck twinges, and he automatically imagines how Peter\u2019s must feel. \u201cSorry, May. Just gimme a sec.\u201d</p><p>He feels the seat next to him dip down. \u201cIf anyone can get through this, it\u2019s him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t <i>have</i> to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is. And there\u2019s nothing we can do to reverse that.\u201d May says sternly. Then her voice softens. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Tony. And you know if he could, he\u2019d tell you that. He\u2019d hate to think you were upset over him. You know what he\u2019s like, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony tilts his head to look up at her. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult not to feel accountable. That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d He shrugs and claps his hands together.</p><p>May\u2019s expression is empathetic and warm. It\u2019s never been more clear to him where Peter gets it from. </p><p>\u201cYou look like you could use a shower and one hell of a coffee IV. Go. Your FRIDAY voice thing can tell you if we\u2019re allowed in to see him, right?\u201d </p><p>Tony nods. Although it was a suggestion, he can\u2019t help but feel that May has ordered it. \u201cYeah. Alright.\u201d</p><p>He stands to leave, but so does May. She puts a hand on his shoulder. He turns, surprised. </p><p>She kisses his cheek. \u201cThank you. For looking after him. He\u2019d be lost without you.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes fill a little \u2013 his eyes flit up and down her face and he swallows. She nods at him, squeezes his shoulder and heads towards the coffee machine. He watches her go and marvels at how amazing women are. </p><p>He holds that thought the whole time he showers, as he shaves and as he gets dressed. </p><p>The sentiment grows and blooms in his chest, warm, as Pepper comes in and straightens the wrinkles from his t-shirt. She evaluates his face, hands either side of it, and presses a soft kiss to his lips. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that question with a fiery burning passion.\u201d He kisses her again and they wrap around each other. </p><p>Pepper gives him a look and goes to sit with May when they\u2019re leaving his room to find Steve, Nat, Clint and Wanda waiting in the living area for news. They all look expectantly up as he enters, and Tony tenses up till he reads the sympathy in their stances.</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s sent me 4 texts about him.\u201d Steve huffs a laugh. Tony smiles.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be ecstatic to hear that.\u201d Tony knows Peter thinks Sam Wilson is about the coolest guy on the planet. He\u2019s pretty sure the feeling is mutual, especially ever since Sam found out that Peter had chosen to write an essay on him, specifically on his work as a PTSD counsellor. </p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s okay?\u201d Wanda asks.</p><p>Tony sighs. Their faces fall. \u201cNo. He\u2019s not good right now. Bruce says it is tetanus, and he\u2019s given him the antitoxin, and the antibiotics, and the anticonvulsants\u2026 he\u2019s had about every anti under the sun at this point, but\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHis enhanced healing isn\u2019t working?\u201d Nat asks.</p><p>Tony shakes his head, holding up his hand to lazily point at her in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the kid get so much as a runny nose before, let alone tetanus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez. Tetanus. It\u2019s rough.\u201d Clint mutters, looking angry. Clint\u2019s the kinda guy to issue a death threat against tetanus itself. Tony wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he succeeded, either.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything we can do?\u201d Steve asks tentatively.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know what <i>I</i> can do, Rogers.\u201d Tony murmurs. \u201cJust\u2026 <i>when</i> he gets better,\u201d they all nod enthusiastically at his wishful wording, \u201ccome visit him? Kid loves hanging out with you losers, for some reason.\u201d He smiles at them, knowing that exhaustion and anxiety are blatant on his face. </p><p>They all smile softly and nod, agreeing unequivocally. Tony jerks his head back at them. \u201cThanks, folks. Does, uh, anyone else want coffee? I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss, Dr Banner\u2019s about to speak to May Parker.\u201d </p><p>\u201cScratch that. Make your own coffee, I guess, you lazy schmucks.\u201d</p><p>Tony Stark doesn\u2019t run anywhere unless there\u2019s a fire behind him or a single-malt scotch ahead of him, but he can\u2019t really in good faith deny that he didn\u2019t jog down to medical.</p><p>Bruce is waiting for him, May no longer there. </p><p>Bruce always looks tired so he has to take a second to digest the dark bags under the man\u2019s eyes as he approaches him. \u201cHi, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Tony puts his hand on his shoulder. \u201cD\u2019you wanna sit?\u201d</p><p>Bruce hesitates. He says, \u201cYeah. I could sit.\u201d like Tony\u2019s offering to take him for dinner.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me straight, doc.\u201d </p><p>He squeezes his palms together till his fingers go white waiting for the bad news. The room seems to go silent as the world-ending fear he\u2019s been fighting off since May relegated him to the shower crashes down onto his chest. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gonna die. And his last word\u2019s gonna be \u201cStay.\u201d </p><p>And it\u2019s gonna play over in Tony\u2019s mind forever. The way he said it, so desperate and agonised and terrified. </p><p>He thinks he\u2019s gonna throw up till Bruce goes, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d, and he exhales like a storm wind.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank god. Bruce. Thank you. Thank you so much. I don\u2019t\u2014if you hadn\u2019t\u2014oh, thank <i>god.\u201d</i></p><p>Bruce chuckles. \u201cI gave him both chlorpromazine and the diazepam and it stopped the convulsions. He\u2019s got everything he needs now. Scans are showing that his body \u2013 you know, his enhanced metabolism and the healing factor \u2013 they\u2019re reacting well to it \u2013 I didn\u2019t have enough antibiotics or antitoxins on the plane to combat it properly but now I do, and it\u2019s turning itself around.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s shaking his head at him, grinning. \u201cI could kiss you. You know what?\u201d He takes Bruce\u2019s head in both hands and smacks his forehead with a big kiss. \u201cI can and did. You beautiful man. Thank you, Brucie. You\u2019re a myth and a legend.\u201d</p><p>Bruce blushes and smiles. He was never good at being complimented. \u201cYou can see him if you like. I didn\u2019t sedate him, but he\u2019s asleep anyway. I can still keep an eye on his brain activity that way. He isn\u2019t in nearly as much pain, either. That\u2014that was a priority.\u201d</p><p>For a second, Tony considers the fact that there in fact very well may be a god.</p><hr><p>Peter doesn\u2019t sleep for long. He\u2019s slept more in the past couple days than he probably has in the last month, and although the pain is lessened, it still can\u2019t be pleasant enough to let him stay out for long.</p><p>Tony just sends up his thanks that he\u2019s not seizing anymore. </p><p>Bruce does some simple tests on him and seems satisfied. </p><p>May is there, and she sits beside his head as he groggily turns into her thigh. She whispers to him, and he squeezes her hand to let her know he\u2019s alright. She cries a little at first, murmuring, \u201cHey, baby. Hello, Petey. Does it hurt? I know you\u2019re hurting, baby.\u201d to him and this makes him move even closer into her. He rubs her hand clumsily.</p><p>It\u2019s a reflection of exactly what she\u2019s been doing whilst he slept, and Tony once again can\u2019t help but think on how much they\u2019ve rubbed off on each other.</p><p>But then she mentions that he\u2019s in a hospital, and the realisation that he\u2019s not at home must break through the fog of his sleepy mind, because he sort-of comes to himself. </p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t you move that neck of yours, Peter Parker.\u201d May warns. Unsettled, Peter tries to swallow and gags on it, and she gingerly strokes his throat to calm him down. \u201cI\u2019m here. Tony\u2019s here. Okay? You\u2019re safe and you\u2019re getting looked after, and,\u201d she lowers her tone and catches his cheek to get his full attention, \u201cthe more you stress out, the longer it\u2019ll take for you to get better. You\u2019ve been really sick, baby. I was scared.\u201d</p><p>He gasps twice, convulsively, then settles. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, honey. You\u2019ll set Tony off too. You know what he\u2019s like.\u201d She looks up at him and winks. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t really know what Peter\u2019s doing when he eases his right hand out of May\u2019s hold and replaces it with his left, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to grab it when it\u2019s held out behind him expectantly. \u201cYep, I\u2019m here, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes it for a long while. Tony does it back, two quick squeezes like his mom used to do to his knee when he needed reassurance. </p><p>His skin is pale and cold. \u201cDamn, kid! Cold heart, cold hands, huh? Hold on, Ice Queen Elsa.\u201d Tony blows warm air onto it and he swears he sees the corner of Peter\u2019s mouth twitch up beneath the new, smaller, <i>quieter </i>oxygen mask. </p><p>\u201cBruce says he thinks he\u2019ll have his voice back by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour healing factor just needed a nudge in the right direction, huh?\u201d Tony asks Peter, who had been looking up at both at them as they chatted quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s basically what he said, yeah.\u201d May smiles. \u201cWell, at least now he\u2019s been humbled to the trials and tribulations of us <i>normies</i> without our super duper fancy healing powers.\u201d She teases. </p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have gotten something a little less dramatic, next time, could he? I already have a heart condition.\u201d Peter crushes his hand fiercely. Tony pats it with his other hand, laughing. \u201cKidding, kid. But, seriously, please don\u2019t do that again. I know you\u2019ll be desperate to repeat this fun experience, but I can\u2019t take it.\u201d May nods meaningfully at Peter, eyebrows raised. Tony sighs. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d better go and get all that stuff done that Pepper\u2019s been hounding me about. You\u2019re staying here?\u201d He asks May.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Got my four poster.\u201d She jerks her head to the cot behind her. \u201c5 stars, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s a room here for you when he\u2019s better. <i>Real</i> four poster.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI expect nothing less, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony presses his knuckles to Peter\u2019s temple and murmurs his goodbyes, then heads out. He doesn\u2019t want to go, but May\u2019s there, and he\u2019s sure they can do with some privacy.</p><p>Turns out that Pepper\u2019s first and only Big Task for him is to get some shuteye. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t even try to fight her on it.</p><hr><p>Very early the next morning, FRIDAY tells him May is heading to shower, so he heads down. </p><p>Bruce is intercepting a nurse who\u2019s carrying a fresh catheter drainage bag. He takes it from her and smiles, then sees Tony and waves. He\u2019s wearing the white coat he normally wears in the lab, with the addition of a stethoscope and the fact that it\u2019s<i> clean</i> for once.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, all rested and professional. Look at this!\u201d He flicks the drum of the stethoscope. \u201cDashing. God, you better watch out you don\u2019t get done for fraud. Anyone would think those PhDs were actually in medicine.\u201d</p><p>Bruce laughs at that. \u201cWell\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing? He speaking yet?\u201d</p><p>Bruce shakes his head. \u201cNot yet. He\u2019s responding well to everything we\u2019re giving him. Basically everything bothering him now is from the neck upwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going in the right direction? Sounds like it\u2019s basically put itself into rewind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s it. The only thing is that his blood pressure\u2019s kind of unstable. It\u2019s giving him some vertigo and a bad headache, so I\u2019m not going to reduce the analgesia yet. I get the feeling his pain tolerance is\u2026 one to be matched. His heart rate\u2019s still high and he seems a bit\u2014\u201d he mimes moving a stiff neck, \u201creluctant to move it, you know? But I don\u2019t really have a reason to believe that won\u2019t right itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Cool. That\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go in - and take this. I\u2019ll be with you soon.\u201d Tony takes the catheter bag and pushes through the doors. </p><p>Peter still looks sick as a dog, but he\u2019s on the nasal cannula now, and he seems to be in a more comfortable position. </p><p>The head of the bed has been raised somewhat, so he sees Tony when he enters. He waves at him dopily, and it makes Tony grin.</p><p>\u201cHey! Kid! The Ban-man says you\u2019re feeling a little better. That\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>Peter can manage more of a smile now. It\u2019s all lopsided, and it looks funny and heart-warming all at once. </p><p>Once Tony\u2019s sat beside him, cross-legged and beaming back, he seems satisfied enough to close his eyes. </p><p>\u201cBruce says you\u2019ve been getting some vertigo. Dizzy, huh?\u201d Peter quirks another half-smile in confirmation.</p><p>He suddenly remembers being back on the highway, Peter hunched over himself as he tries not to pass out. His chest tightens and he looks long and hard at the kid.</p><p>Peter opens an eye and looks at him. They share a look for a while before Tony speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re sick, kiddo.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes narrow. They practically <i>scream</i> at him not to apologise. Tony snickers. He can\u2019t wait to be berated by the kid when he finally gets his voice back. </p><p>In all honesty, he can\u2019t wait.</p><p>He chuckles again when Peter doesn\u2019t stop glaring. \u201cOkay, alright! No more self-pitying. God, you\u2019re mean. That\u2019s my favourite pastime.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes roll up into his eyelids as they close. \u201cI can<i> taste</i> the sarcasm on your tongue, kiddo. How can you do that when you can\u2019t even speak? Kids are so weird and moody these days.\u201d</p><p>Peter quirks an eyebrow without opening his eyes. Tony sighs and ruffles his hair. \u201cGet some more sleep, Pete.\u201d He earns a thumbs-up for that.</p><p>The room is quiet for a while. It\u2019s not an awkward one, but comfortable \u2013 like when they\u2019d been driving only a week ago and they\u2019d both fallen into companionable silence. Tony relishes it.</p><p>He decides he may as well relax too. He leans back in his chair, arms crossed, and shuts his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGotta admit, s\u2019a bit weird that <i>you</i> brought in th\u2019bag th\u2019s gunna hold my pee. Think unnerving is th\u2019word.\u201d</p><p>The next second, Tony\u2019s jumping out of his skin so high he thinks he\u2019ll be a naked skeleton for the rest of his life, and Peter\u2019s laughing his whispery, croaking laugh that is nothing but music to his ears.</p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Mis\u2019r</i> <i>S\u2019ark</i>!\u201d Peter mimics back. He\u2019s sick, and he\u2019s shaky, and his voice is weak and quiet, but he\u2019s <i>smiling</i>. Really <i>smiling.</i> Tony is grinning like a fool back at him.</p><p>He leans forward and gathers the kid in his arms for a cautious hug. \u201cYou little scoundrel!\u201d</p><p>Peter hugs him back harder than Tony\u2019s hugging him, and he pushes his nose into his neck. \u201cS\u2019rry, man. C\u2019d\u2019nt resist.\u201d</p><p>When they lean back, Peter\u2019s smile has changed. It\u2019s a quiet kind of smile. \u201cThanks f\u2019r lookin\u2019 out f\u2019r me, Mis\u2019r S\u2019ark. And\u2026 s\u2019rry f\u2019r scarin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome kid. Just\u2026 no repeats, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and then winces. He laughs at himself whilst Tony scowls at his pain. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. M\u2019okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout as okay as you can be, all things considered, I guess. How\u2019s the headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll move you down.\u201d He grabs the control and lowers the head of the bed. \u201cBit better?\u201d Peter sends him another thumbs up. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>The same calm quiet comes back, but Tony doesn\u2019t settle down again. He watches Peter\u2019s vitals for a while, then the kid himself. He\u2019s not sleeping, he knows he\u2019s feeling a little too unwell to settle down completely. But he doesn\u2019t feel that same sinking hopelessness in his stomach anymore. </p><p>\u201cHey. M\u2019s\u2019r S\u2019rk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Say, \u2018yes, P\u2019t\u2019r?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, P\u2019t\u2019r?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Shh</i>. Properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2019D\u2019n\u2019t be a pain \u2018n th\u2019neck.\u2019</i> Remember? <i>Foreshad\u2019wing.</i>\u201d He says reverently. The giddiness is evident in his voice.</p><p>Tony practically rolls his eyes into his skull. \u201cHow long have you been sitting on that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince th\u2019plane.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are the absolute worst, Parker.\u201d Tony laughs. He puts a hand through Peter\u2019s hair and smiles at him. Peter smiles back, till Tony\u2019s face falls. \u201cWait a damn second. \u2018Foreshadowing\u2019? Are you saying<i> I\u2019m</i> to blame for this?\u201d</p><p>Peter grins and shuts his eyes. </p><p>\u201cHey! Nuh-uh, no pulling the sleep card. Are you saying I injected you with tetanus, Mr Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, M\u2019s\u2019r S\u2019rk.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am so leaving you in California next time.\u201d</p>",

Thank you sm!!!</p><p>(I am sO very much not a doctor in any way so please pretend I know what I\u2019m talking about and that this is actually convincing!)</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15674718\">this fic on ao3</a></p><hr><p>Driving long distances wasn\u2019t really Tony\u2019s thing. </p><p>Being a man of ample wealth \u2013 not to mention a distinct lack of affinity with \u2018scenic routes\u2019 comprised entirely of cornfields \u2013 \u00a0made it a pretty basic principal: when a private jet is an option, you don\u2019t say no.</p><p>That, and the fact that he\u2019s pretty sure he has some nice internalised trauma in the back somewhere from his parents dying in a car, or something. Shut up. Whatever. Road trips weren\u2019t his thing.</p><p>Go figure. <br><br>So to say he was surprised to find himself openly offering to cart one Peter Parker to <i>California </i>and back? That would be an understatement. </p><p>45 hours of driving. Both ways. 90 hours.</p><p>Oh, what the hell. Was he really that surprised? He loves the kid. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Peter wasn\u2019t going to college for another couple years, but the kid could\u2019ve been there a long time ago. It was only natural that he was interested in the top universities the country had to offer; Stanford and Berkeley being right up there, and easily within his academic sights.</p><p>Tony had somehow managed to get May\u2019s pride complex to share a room with his desire to sponsor Peter a full ride. She\u2019d heard him out, and the whole time he was speaking, he could see the conflict on her face.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want charity. Even the implication of it made her squirm.</p><p>But she loved Peter, and she wanted him to achieve his full potential. Though her and Ben had accepted the fact a long time ago, it was still awful that they had to mortgage what felt like everything, from the roof over their head to the air in their lungs, to nurture Peter\u2019s gifts. </p><p>And here was Tony, offering him everything he deserved and more. It wouldn\u2019t make even a dent in Tony\u2019s bank balance, and it was clear he was offering out of love and care for her nephew, and nothing else. No ulterior motive, no sleazy need to sedate a guilty conscience.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t seen Peter trying to hide the Stanford prospectus under his hamper, the Yale webpage that was hastily closed when she walked past.</p><p>So she said yes. </p><p>And Peter was really grateful, and<i> really</i> happy. </p><p>They\u2019d been in the lab, working on something or other \u2013 web fluid and shooters, maybe \u2013 and Peter had been talking about California. Stanford, specifically. And how May was stressing about booking time off for an open day. </p><p>\u201cI could take you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t worry about it Mr Stark, it\u2019s cool! She\u2019ll just have to do some make-up graveyard shifts, and I was gonna help out by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFRI, compare the open day dates. Am I free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Ms Potts are in Stockholm between the 5th July and 17th August. The visitor centre isn\u2019t open outside of those dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no dice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dice, Boss.\u201d</p><p>Though Peter had politely rejected the idea, Tony could\u2019ve sworn his face fell just a little. He cleared his throat and threw a grape into his mouth, leaning back in his chair and considering. </p><p>After a minute or so of the kid side-eyeing him from his bubbling formula, he threw a grape at Peter\u2019s head to get his attention, then stared off into space innocently, pretending he hadn\u2019t thrown it. </p><p>\u201cThey know me at Stanford. I\u2019ve got sway. <i>And</i> Berkeley, I think.\u201d He shrugged, pointing at the ceiling. \u201cHit me with it, FRIDAY.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got honorary alumni status at both, Boss.\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned at Peter like all his problems were solved. \u201cReally! <i>Aces</i>.\u201d </p><p>Peter narrowed his eyes. \u201cMr Stark, I\u2026 you know how thankful I am to you for funding me this scholarship, and all, and I am! Really. It\u2019s\u2026 it means so much to me. And May. But I can\u2019t just ask you to fly me out there on top of everything else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about flying? Are you putting words in my mouth again, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I\u2019ve never put\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a pain in the neck! We could make it a fun little road trip - take the Audi. I know it\u2019s your favourite. Stop at a hotel, do some sightseeing. You\u2019ve never been to San Francisco, you can be a disgusting tourist!\u201d Peter crossed his arms and rolled his eyes, not even trying to conceal his smile. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be fun! It\u2019d be a week, tops. And I can make up for being in Sweden for most of your summer.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled at him softly. \u201c<i>Usually</i> it\u2019s the kid begging the adult to let them do something crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, whoa there. Foolish, perhaps. Eccentric, possibly. But crazy? You\u2019re toeing the line, there, kid.\u201d He stood and moved to Peter\u2019s workstation, flopping into his chair and pouting dramatically. \u201cCome oooon. You never do anything fun with me.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed. \u201cMr <i>Stark</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony stuck his bottom lip out further and stirred the web fluid concoction sadly. \u201cNever wants to spend time with me.\u201d He muttered. \u201cAlways with Ned. Never with Mr Stark.\u201d He sighed, slumping his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Peter laughed. \u201cFine! We can go.\u201d </p><p>They both knew he\u2019d been in from the second Tony had suggested it.</p><hr><p><i>whoa dude im so jealous!!!! Facetime me when youre at the hotel and tell me about it!!</i><br></p><p>Tony smirks to himself as he brings his eyes back to the road. That was Ned\u2019s reply to Peter\u2019s earlier text of, \u2018<i>best trip ever!!!!\u2019</i>, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel just a little bit smug about it.</p><p>He\u2019s feeling more sad than smug, though. He and Peter\u2019d had a really fun time, and he\u2019s a little disappointed it\u2019s over so soon. They\u2019d had pretty much unprecedented tours of Berkeley and Stanford, which Peter had loved (though he didn\u2019t envy Peter of the future, having to pick one of all these colleges that\u2019d have him at the drop of a hat). </p><p>Then they\u2019d had a couple days just here and there, sightseeing and relaxing and eating good food, staying in a nice hotel in San Francisco that made Peter bounce on the balls of his feet in excitement at the luxury.\u00a0</p><p>Tony received a selfie off him in his bath tub, up to the eyeballs in bubbles and a champagne flute of orange juice in his hand.</p><p>A squirrel had tried to basically mug Peter of his pretzels in Golden Gate Park. Tony couldn\u2019t with 100% certainty guarantee that May hadn\u2019t been immediately sent a perfectly timed photo of the attack, or that she wasn\u2019t framing multiple copies at that very moment. God, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d laughed so hard.</p><p>Chuckling under his breath at the memory, he looks over at the kid, who\u2019s fast asleep beside him. His smile turns at the corners into a grimace when he sees the position Peter\u2019s in \u2013 slumped forward, his neck at a weird angle. </p><p>Peter had mentioned yesterday that his neck and jaw had been a bit stiff and sore. Tony had joked that he was probably sleeping on the ceiling <i>just because he could</i>, and that was why his neck was playing up.\u00a0</p><p>Peter had laughed, said something about taking a hit on patrol. From then on, Tony couldn\u2019t help but notice every time Peter rubbed his mouth or winced slightly at a movement, and had resolved to take the suit in for upgrades; starting with more head and neck support.<br></p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been bothering him too much, if the vigour with which he took up the role of slack-jawed tourist was anything to go by.</p><p>Well, at least he didn\u2019t have to worry about <i>why</i> the kid\u2019s healing factor wasn\u2019t fixing up the injury \u2013 sleep like <i>that</i> and it was no wonder his neck was all strained.\u00a0</p><p>He looks like some kind of creepy contortionist, head flopped forward and twisted towards the window. He\u2019s only restrained by the seatbelt \u2013 otherwise he\u2019d be faceplanting the dash for sure. </p><p>Boy, was he out of it. Had he maybe overdone it with the touristy things?</p><p><i>Nah. </i></p><p>Kid loved it. </p><p>\u201cSomeone gets you in one spot for longer than 30 seconds one time and you pull a Sleeping Beauty.\u201d He softly grouses. Peter\u2019s knowledge of good health habits \u2013 namely that you <i>actually have to sleep every once in a blue moon</i> \u2013 is shockingly poor for a kid genius. He focuses back on the road for a split second before his head whips back. \u201cI only called you Beauty to get the reference right. It\u2019s not a compliment. Don\u2019t get cocky.\u201d </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t stir. Tony sighs, leaning over to push him back against the seat with one hand against his chest. Once he\u2019s there and the seatbelt is more lax, he tries to ease his head back a little, withdrawing suddenly, fingers curling at the surprise heat he finds on Peter\u2019s brow. </p><p>He coughs under his breath, confusion spreading under his features. He corrects the car\u2019s course an inch to the left, thankful they\u2019re on a straight, almost empty highway, and presses his entire hand to Peter\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201c<i>El scorchio.</i> Peter? Hey, Parker, rise and shine.\u201d He shakes Peter\u2019s shoulder whilst staring at the road, awkwardness now for some reason filling up inside him. </p><p>Peter grunts. \u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up.\u201d He exhales long and slow out of his nose and rubs his eyes and neck, hissing at the latter like Tony had expected him to.</p><p>He squeezes one eye shut and twists his features to the left as he pointlessly tries to inspect his neck. He must agitate his sore jaw doing this, because he hisses again. Tony stares ahead at the road. </p><p>\u201cAw man. I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep. Sorry, Mr Stark.\u201d He says. \u201cAre we stopping or didja just miss me?\u201d He taunts.</p><p>Tony plays with words in his mouth. Peter sounds okay, has enough in him to make fun\u2026</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d do a number on your neck if I let you sleep like that any longer. I\u2019m sure your aunt would have a thing or two to say about that. You alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad.\u201d</p><p><i>Sure. And since we\u2019re playing make-believe, I\u2019m late for my date with the Tooth Fairy, so if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026</i></p><p>Peter pulls his hoodie off. He balls it up and hugs it to him, his socked feet up on the seat. Tony makes a cursory glance at him, and catches his eye. He smiles. Peter smiles back \u2013 his eyes are tired. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop in about half an hour. You can go back to sleep if you want, I\u2019m fine with the radio.\u201d</p><p>Peter turns on the radio. \u201cNah. I\u2019ve left you on your own \u2013 which, by the way, Ms Potts told me <i>never</i> to do \u2013 for like, half an hour already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I know y\u2014<i>two hours</i>?\u201d</p><p>Tony snorts and nods. \u201cAaa<i>yup</i>. Did an excellent corpse impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr <i>Stark</i>!\u201d Peter whines, cracking his window open and sticking his fingers out. \u201cYou shoulda woke me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, think you\u2019ll find I <i>did</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSooner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m nothing if not a generous man.\u201d Peter doesn\u2019t rebut the statement, and Tony promptly files it away under <i>Jokes That Fall Flat Because The Kid Still Thinks I\u2019m a Good Person</i>. \u201cAnd I thought I\u2019d better leave you to your fever-\u201c he shoots him a wilting look, \u201cand all. But yeah, you know, it\u2019s chill. It\u2019s cool. Well, you\u2019re not chill or cool. Because of the fever. Hey, look at that! I made a funny.\u201d</p><p>Peter is glaring at him, but with no heat behind it. \u201cI get warm when I sleep, and I had this on.\u201d He gestures to the hoodie. Tony sighs.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Mr Stark, I feel fine.\u201d</p><p>Tony relents. \u201cYou wanna put one of your playlists on?\u201d</p><p>Peter grins. </p><hr><p>They stop for food. Peter gets a grilled cheese and strawberry milkshake. Tony watches him with reserved concern whenever he\u2019s not looking. </p><p>The kid\u2019s still bubbly and happy and warm - still <i>warm</i> warm, too. Tony sneakily checked by messing up Peter\u2019s hair like he hates him doing \u2013 but he is a little quieter.</p><p>He definitely doesn\u2019t inhale his food like he normally does, or order seconds like he normally does, and when Tony orders <i>himself</i> seconds, he excuses himself to the bathroom.</p><p>Tony eats the onion rings first in the couple minutes he\u2019s gone. He has his suspicions that the strong smell wasn\u2019t agreeing with the kid.</p><p>And, as always, his jaw\u2019s bothering him. Neck, too. </p><p>Watching him eat with exaggerated care and obvious pain is driving Tony\u2019s blood pressure through the damn roof.</p><p>They\u2019re back on the road now, have been for about 4 hours. </p><p>Tony listens to the classical station on low volume, the local news on medium, the rock station on almost mute. He ends up shutting it all off.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t plan on stopping till 2 or 3am; however long it takes to get to their hotel checkpoint. It just makes sense to drive till late, when it\u2019s quiet, then sleep in to miss the early morning traffic, have a late breakfast and do the same again. </p><p>He\u2019ll stop if Peter asks, but otherwise, he\u2019s good. </p><p>The quiet \u2013 Peter\u2019s obviously out cold once again \u2013 is actually nice. It\u2019s not heavy and oppressive, like he can find quiet to be. It\u2019s just steady. He\u2019s thinking about things without feeling overwhelmed. He can just drive and think and think and drive.</p><p>And keep an eye on the kid. </p><p>He shifts in his sleep, head now pillowed against the window with Tony\u2019s jacket, and hoodie still bunched up in his arms, hugged to his waist.</p><p>It\u2019s only 9pm right now, and he\u2019s wondering whether to push it till 10:30 or maybe 11. Six hours is a long time to drive non-stop, but he\u2019s not really hungry from his huge lunch, and he doesn\u2019t need the bathroom. </p><p>It all depends on Peter. If he stays asleep, he guesses he could just keep driving. </p><p>He\u2019s only a couple minutes into that resolution when Peter does wake. </p><p>\u201cEvening.\u201d He says softly. \u201cHow d\u2019you feel?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flutter shut again and he offers only a small smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d He doesn\u2019t move. Tony\u2019s too smart to know it\u2019s not because the position is too comfortable to relinquish. </p><p>He knows it\u2019s because any movement will jar and pain him. </p><p>He\u2019d offer him painkillers, but the kid\u2019s already refused them twice today. God, what can he do? Maybe he should take him on a spa day or something.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Pete. I wasn\u2019t gonna stop for a little while, but we can if you need to.\u201d </p><p>Peter flaps a hand at him. \u201cI\u2019m good. Maybe in, like, an hour?\u201d </p><p>Tony nods. \u201cSure thing. Hey, I was thinking. D\u2019you think you\u2019ve got a bad case of whiplash or something? Because you\u2019re flipping around Queens all day and I haven\u2019t put all that much reinforcement in the neck of the suit.\u201d</p><p>Peter eyes him and what looks like relief floods his features. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah? Gimme the suit when we\u2019re back. I\u2019ll work on that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf <i>course.</i> You think I\u2019m gonna let you let me do all the work for you?\u201d </p><p>Peter breathes out a laugh that turns into a more forced exhale when he moves to sit up straight. He leans forward tentatively, head in his hands. Tony\u2019s jacket slips down from the window into his lap and he digs a hand into it.</p><p>Tony balks. He can\u2019t reach for him, the road around them is busy. \u201cHey, hey, hey. Easy. What\u2019s wrong, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019okay. Just got sorta dizzy.\u201d Peter says, not moving from his position. \u201cI thought\u2014it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d Tony pulls up into gravel of the shoulder as gently as possible. He undoes both his and Peter\u2019s seatbelts. </p><p>He hesitates over what to do now he has his hands free and settles on rubbing a hand up and down Peter\u2019s lower back. \u201cStay like that if it helps, Peter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThought I might pass out.\u201d </p><p>Tony feels Peter\u2019s cheek with the back of his hand. It\u2019s clammy. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Mr Stark. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s okay.\u201d He murmurs. \u201cJust a headache. Not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I was asleep for too long?\u201d Tony doesn\u2019t fail to notice that Peter\u2019s voice is a little bit croaky. \u201cIn one position.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s insides twist. That isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just breathe.\u201d</p><p>Peter breathes. Tony looks up the nearest hotel, motel, truck stop, anything, and finds a motel a couple miles down the road. Peter tries to argue against it, so Tony just lies and says he\u2019s tired too.</p><p>The guy at the desk is nice. He\u2019s a huge, broad guy, with an impressive dark beard that Tony compliments the second he enters the reception. </p><p>He apologises profusely that they only have one room free, and it\u2019s a king. Tony insists it\u2019s fine. He wouldn\u2019t care if it were a shack that was $1,000,000/h: as long as it was clean and Peter got to lie down, he couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Peter, poor kid, must have held a similar kind of ethics for the situation, since he only argued with Tony for 5 minutes about who got the bed (\u201c<i>But Mr Stark, you\u2019re driving. And paying. You\u2019re already stopping for me. I like sleeping on couches.</i>\u201d \u201c<i>Not a chance in absolute hell, kid. Here\u2019s your pyjamas.\u201d</i>) before he fell into it face first and dead to the world.</p><p>The motel wasn\u2019t bad. It wasn\u2019t anything like the place Tony had originally booked for tonight, but it wasn\u2019t grimy or falling apart at the seams either. </p><p>It has clean sheets, a hot shower, a decent coffee machine, and a separate light for the kitchenette that means Tony can keep the room dim but still get some work done at the table. </p><p>He sits back and stares at the papers. This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d expected to spend his evening. To be fair to Pepper \u2013 and he rarely was \u2013 she\u2019d be ecstatic that he was finally getting down to some business.</p><p>But, if he was <i>totally</i> honest, he\u2019d been looking forward to a repeat of the journey here: he and Peter\u2019d had a fun time. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fault. The kid probably already felt guilty for the fact that he\u2019d altered their plans \u2013 even if he couldn\u2019t help it. </p><p>He resolves to make<i> sure </i>Peter knew he wasn\u2019t mad at him when he was feeling better. He hopes that\u2019d be tomorrow morning, what with Peter\u2019s healing factor. He had to admit that although they didn\u2019t spend every waking moment together, he\u2019d never seen Peter sick. It made him more than a little uncomfortable.</p><p><i>Oh well</i>. He picks up his pen and sighs. <i>No time like the present.</i></p><hr><p>He eventually goes to the couch and gets a few hours shuteye. He sleeps till 3:45am, which isn\u2019t too bad, all things considered. It\u2019s about the limit of what he can get right now, what with the nightmares and the insomnia. </p><p>And a distinct lack of Pepper by his side.</p><p>Heaving himself up, he flips on the small lamp by the couch. Peter\u2019s still out of it, but his face has less lines than before. </p><p>Tony smiles. The kid\u2019s face has definitely regained more colour. </p><p>He picks up discarded items of clothing as he heads for the coffeemaker, folding them and placing them back on top of Peter\u2019s bag. As he drops them down, he notices the kid\u2019s phone screen light up at him. It\u2019s on 12%, and Tony\u2019s has a pet peeve for low batteries. He plugs it in on the nightstand and flips it onto silent.</p><p>Sitting back at the table, he mulls over the situation. </p><p>For starters, he\u2019s never seen Peter willingly sleep so much. He must be feeling really crappy to have slept for\u2026 what? It\u2019s gotta be <i>well </i>over 12 hours now. </p><p>For what Tony liked to call \u201cseconders\u201d (to piss Rhodey off), he had to admit to his paranoid, panicking brain that \u201cwillingly\u201d was the operative word when he\u2019d said he\u2019d never seen Peter sleep that much. He <i>had </i>seen Peter sleep that much.</p><p>It just\u2026 wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 with his consent? </p><p>The handful of times he\u2019d been injured as Spider-Man, his healing factor had forced him to sort of\u2026 hibernate so it could focus on repairing his body. Tony hoped to god that it was what was happening here.</p><p>For nexters, although the seconders answered one question, it raised another: if it was his enhanced healing, why wasn\u2019t it patching up his neck?</p><p>He would\u2019ve gone for a home run with <i>for lasters</i>, but he\u2019d been sitting and staring at the kid for so long, and the kid had been dead still the entire time. Which, for Peter Parker, sleeptalker extraordinaire, was weird. <i>Weird.</i></p><p>Peter was an active sleeper, to say the least. He was almost as hyper in sleep as he was awake (which embarrassed him to no end). He was always talking, laughing \u2013 which was <i>super</i> creepy, can he just say for the record \u2013 tossing and turning and ending up at the other end of the bed, or even slipping off the couch if there wasn\u2019t someone there to nudge him back on. Kid could sleep through a hurricane if it weren\u2019t for his Spidey sense.</p><p>But now\u2026 now Peter\u2019s in the centre of the bed, the <i>hogger,</i> comforter wrapped tight around his neck, and silent. When Tony comes closer, he sees that the kid\u2019s sweating. </p><p>He groans under his breath. </p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d he says, only half-hoping he\u2019d wake until he feels the same warmth amidst Peter\u2019s curls. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>Peter stirs lethargically. He goes to turn his head towards Tony, eyes closed, but they squint further shut in pain when his neck protests. \u201cHey, time s\u2019it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLate.\u201d Tony answers honestly, softly. </p><p>He feels awkward standing by the kid\u2019s bedside, but now he\u2019s up close, he\u2019s bordering dangerously on concern for Peter\u2019s wax-candle paleness and body temperature. \u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter is a terrible liar - <i>especially</i> when bleary from sleep. Tony knows this before he even speaks, from the convulsive swallow and the soft, surprised gasp of pain that follows it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, man, I\u2019m good. We leaving? I can just\u2014\u201d he swallows again and <i>does this kid really think I\u2019m not seeing this?</i> and rubs at his neck, \u201c\u2014can just grab a quick shower and I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He begins coordinating his limbs into movement. Tony holds him down by his shoulder, and Peter squeaks a protesting <i>hey!</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. You\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not!\u201d Peter croaks, eyes already starting to slip shut again. \u201cI jus\u2019 woke up. Gimme a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-<i>huh</i>.\u201d He turns towards the kitchen and fills a glass of water, making sure it\u2019s cool but not ice-cold.</p><p>Peter watches him with an adorable suspicion that Tony pretends not to notice, and one eye cracked open.</p><p>\u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete.\u201d He cuts in, although gently. \u201cI\u2019m a hair\u2019s width from asking Hagrid at reception for a thermometer.\u201d Peter smiles slightly at the reference. He accepts the glass. \u201cGood call, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Whilst he drinks, Tony turns away again and heads to the couch, where he flips open his duffel and unzips the back pocket. </p><p>He rummages around, humming an <i>ah-ha!</i> as he pulls out some painkillers and shakes the pot by his ear. He grimaces when he hears what could only be a couple pills rattling around inside.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t be enough for him.</p><p>He went back to Peter, who was struggling back the water. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d He takes the glass off him and sets it aside. Peter looks relieved. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough meds for a superkid right now. D\u2019you want me to run to the store,\u201d<i> which is probably 20 miles away,</i> \u201cand grab some? And you\u2019ve got to be honest with me here. Seriously. I know your neck\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, it\u2019s fine, Mr Stark, honestly! I\u2019m fine. Store\u2019s probably like thirty miles away anyway. I\u2019ve had worse. Just needs sleeping off.\u201d Peter rushes to reassure, his voice thin and wispy.</p><p>Tony hesitates. \u201cOkay.\u201d He murmurs. \u201cYou know, you look like shit, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what all the girls say.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t quite believe that, somehow.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiles back. \u201cWe\u2019re not all womanizers like you, Mr Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow very dare you. I\u2019ll tell Miss Potts that when I see her, shall I?\u201d</p><p>Peter smirks. Long gone were the days when he was nervous of Pepper, and anxious to please - the days when Tony\u2019s joking threats like that were taken as gospel. </p><p>He inhales deeply, as though about to yawn, and Tony takes that as his cue to move away back to his makeshift office, when Peter yelps in shock. He shifts back around to see the kid with his mouth hanging half open, hands probing his jaw desperately.</p><p>He\u2019d have made a joke about the wind changing if he had a little less tact.</p><p>\u201cPete?\u201d He comes to sit on the bed, taking his hands calmly and moving them away. Peter barely allows his ministrations, his groan coming out more guttural and unsettling since his mouth was open. He rolls onto his back so Tony can see better. He winces when Tony\u2019s fingers brush against his face. \u201cHey, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019m just taking a quick look. No surprises.\u201d</p><p>Tony takes his chin in his right hand as carefully as he can. Peter\u2019s mouth is almost shut, his teeth bared like they usually would be mid-yawn. They couldn\u2019t have been more than an inch apart, his mouth more a rectangle than an <i>O.</i></p><p>He was gasping at the back of his throat, eyes roaming over Tony in question. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, easy. You\u2019ve probably just clenched it too hard in your sleep and it\u2019s locked. It\u2019s happened to me before.\u201d Peter tries to nod in Tony\u2019s hold. </p><p>Tony takes his hot face more firmly in his hands and runs his thumbs in circles along the highest point of his jaw bone, the bases of his palms just above the wrist cushioning his chin. \u201cStop me if this hurts too much, alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a <i>nuh-uh</i> sound in response. Tony takes it as reassurance that what he\u2019s doing is actually helping. </p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He says again and again, his brow furrowed and face calculating as he searches Peter\u2019s face for any signs of new pain or discomfort. \u201cI know it hurts, but it\u2019s helping. Promise. I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d He jokes. Peter\u2019s eyes shine for a moment, then dull back into his <i>This Hurts But I\u2019m Not One to Complain</i> calibre of Brave Face.</p><p>Slowly, <i>slowly,</i> the pain implicit in the kid\u2019s features recedes, and his jaw eases back to being closed. Tony smoothes over the grooves of his bone structure in inspection. He isn\u2019t sure whether it was fully better or not.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna try opening?\u201d</p><p>Peter twitches it from side to side like he\u2019s swishing mouthwash.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he tries, in a croak. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot better. Thanks, Mr Stark. Really. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiles softly. He hopes that the disquiet in his head wasn\u2019t showing on his face. <i>What the hell is wrong with this kid?</i></p><p>\u201cJeez, that was actually kind of embarrassing.\u201d Peter says slowly, working his jaw out with each word. He rubs his cheek, which was blushing beneath his touch. \u201cThat\u2019s some pretty good ammo to use against me, me sitting here like a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a fish?\u201d Tony chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like a\u2014\u201d Peter makes a stupid face, puffing his cheeks and lazily circling his lips. \u201c\u2014a\u2014a fish.\u201d </p><p>His eyes narrow in affection. \u201cSure.\u201d He huffs a quick laugh out of his nose.</p><p>Peter was covering for how the pain he was feeling right now \u2013 he knows that \u2013 and Tony doesn\u2019t want to break the light atmosphere between them by pointing it out.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, that hurt, but\u2026.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s feeling better now though.\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Better\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018It doesn\u2019t hurt at all\u2019. </i>\u201cAnything else hurt?\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t reply. His forced swallow answers for him. Face a picture of exasperation, Tony\u2019s eyes widen as his eyebrows practically hit his hairline, head cocking to the side in an entirely too paternal show of anticipation of <i>the truth.</i></p><p>Peter reads his expression. He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad. I\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>Tony purses his lips, eyes blinking slowly and chin retracting into his neck as he stares into space. Sarcasm laces his every movement. <i>Say that one more time, and I swear to god\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you think that <i>\u2018I\u2019ve had worse\u2019</i> somehow placates me. At all. Ha ha. You\u2019re actually very amusing, Peter, has anyone ever told you that?\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes slide shut, deflating. \u201cI\u2019m only telling you the truth. Truth hurts sometimes.\u201d His voice held the quality of someone trying not to fall asleep in a second flat. When he speaks again, he\u2019s somehow mustered a sombre tone that provokes Tony into almost believing him. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m okay. Just my neck and my throat hurt. And my jaw. And just a little headache. But, it\u2019s like\u2014localised? So it\u2019s okay. I took a hard hit round there on patrol, the other night. And the whiplash thing that you said. Think that. It\u2019s not that bad. Really, s\u2019all good.\u201d </p><p> \u201cSure. And what about the fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI run hot, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve got the flu, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>He almost hits the roof in surprise when that doesn\u2019t make Peter \u00a0immediately rise up in debate. \u201cMaybe. Be gone tomorrow. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sorries. Only getting betters.\u201d Tony places a cool hand over Peter\u2019s jaw again, presses lightly.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019okay.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, he nods slowly. It\u2019s clear Peter has a high tolerance for pain, and a low tolerance for being worried about. If the kid said he was okay, he had to believe him and leave him, he guessed. </p><p>He makes Peter finish the water, even though it seems to really hurt his throat, and refills it. He puts it within arms reach and opens all the windows. </p><p>Then he gets one of the washcloths from the bathroom and soaks it through. He puts it on Peter\u2019s forehead and leaves it there. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if it gets worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019f course, M\u2019st\u2019r Stark.\u201d Peter curls back onto his side, washcloth sliding down so it\u2019s propped up between his bangs and the quickly soaking pillow. Tony counts it as a win if it\u2019s still touching his skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay, kid.\u201d He pats Peter\u2019s leg \u2013 who he was sure had already passed right out - and goes back to his sketchpads and plans.</p><p>He\u2019s shifted some papers aside and is just opening his laptop to try Googling the kid\u2019s symptoms for some semblance of understanding \u2013 of what the hell might be going on, of how to help the kid (<i>of why his super healing hadn\u2019t kicked in to fix a simple knock to the larynx, and then he gets the flu, for god\u2019s sake, it\u2019s stressing me out</i>) when a quiet but indignant, croaking question rises up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be sleeping? It\u2019s <i>late</i>.\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts. \u201cToo many questions from an inquisitive Spiderling for one day. Go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked <i>one</i> question.\u201d Peter mumbles into his pillow. </p><p>Tony tastes the <i>I\u2019m fine</i> on his tongue and almost laughs at his hypocrisy. He sighs, shutting his laptop. \u201cFinding the concept of sleep a little difficult to grasp at present, if you must know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried list\u2019ning to\u2026 like\u2026 rain?\u201d </p><p>Tony smirks at the &gt;90% unconscious teen on the bed. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He watches the kid, who, with his eyes closed, runs his fingers along the charger till they meet his phone, fumbles a couple times to unlock it, and swipes to a white noise app. \u201cS\u2019\u2026good. Helps me sleep, y\u2019know?\u201d </p><p>Heavy rain and the gush of ocean surf fill the room. Peter tucks his phone beneath his pillow, giving the sound a round, enclosed property that makes it all the more calming. </p><p><i>It helps him block everything else out. </i></p><p><i>Everything\u2019s dialled to 11. </i></p><p>\u201cY\u2019should sleep, you know, Mis\u2019r Stark.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete. Fine. I\u2019m gonna.\u201d</p><p>He mostly lies down on the couch to appease the kid.</p><p>He mostly falls <i>asleep</i> because of the rainy lull that envelopes the room and the echo of <i>it\u2019s not that bad</i> that\u2019s running around his head.</p><p>He wakes to Peter calling his name.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark? I\u2014 <i>ah</i>\u2014\u201d A gasp.</p><p>He pauses for a split second, checking to make sure he didn\u2019t imagine it, then sits bolt upright. \u201cPeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark,\u201d he sounds breathless. Tony reaches for the lamp. </p><p>Illumination billows into the room like smoke and he feels his pupils constrict. His eyes go straight to the kid sitting on the floor, knees drawn up. \u201c<i>Peter?</i>\u201d</p><p>Well, whaddya know?<i> It </i>is<i> that bad.</i></p><p>He crouches before him and wraps a hand around a trembling bicep. That arm is cradling his stomach.</p><p>The other is held awkwardly aloft \u2013 it\u2019s bent so that his elbow is pointing to the ceiling. His face is pressed into the crook of it, and his hand pushes into his neck like he\u2019s desperately trying to alleviate pressure, clawing at it like he\u2019s in agony.</p><p>His face is scrunched up, and he\u2019s breathing harsh and heavy.</p><p>Tony pushes a hand up onto his cheek. \u201cHey. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter just gasps. </p><p>\u201cPete? You\u2019re scaring me here, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 move. I can\u2019t move.\u201d Is forced out through ground teeth.</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach pits. <i>What is this?</i></p><p>Some kind of parasite? Is he going through <i>paralysis? </i></p><p><i>Oh, god. He hoped not.</i></p><p>He schools his features and grabs<i> Initiative</i> firmly by the throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Alright, Peter, where does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>Peter chokes on his breath. \u201c<i>Everywhere</i>.\u201d</p><p>Tony nods, shifts the leg that held his weight. \u201cYeah, I figured. Okay, bud, I\u2019m going to move you real slow, okay? I need you lying down, because I\u2019m very conscious of you passing out right about now. I\u2019ll do the work, okay? Don\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d </p><p>It was like untangling a fierce knot. Tony knew he couldn\u2019t help it. Peter\u2019s super-strength fights against every small touch, and he\u2019s very close to crying - and not stopping. Tony could sense it in his breathing, in his face, in his jarred swallowing. He could literally sense it like a balmy air threatening rain. It was the worst feeling.</p><p>He starts by straightening one of his legs, wanting to put off moving his arms for as long as possible. Now with room in front of him, Peter slowly leans forward to be against Tony. Tony swallows hard and rubs his back. </p><p><i>Do I move him or not? God, do I </i>move him or not?!</p><p>Peter decides for him.</p><p>\u201cI can stand.\u201d He grinds out. Tony doesn\u2019t argue with him. His hands hover over his back as he heaves himself up and sits back on the bed. </p><p>Once he\u2019s down, and his arms are no longer raised, Tony crouches by his head. He squints at him till they have eye contact. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look good, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Peter gives him the saddest of small smiles. Tears are pricking at his tear ducts, and the smile drops. He looks like a little kid. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know. But we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d </p><p>Up close, Peter smells of sweat and the same floral detergent that their entire apartment smells like. Tony thinks of May, and what she\u2019d do. </p><p>Peter\u2019s trembling. He\u2019s paler than a sheet and his voice is little more than a crackle. He\u2019s burning up, and Tony knows that everything above his shoulders is pure agony. </p><p>Something flashes through his mind, a possible diagnosis that rings a bell when the words<i> lockjaw</i> and <i>stiff neck</i> and <i>fever</i> go together, but he shakes his head. Peter\u2019s been vaccinated. May <i>is</i> not,<i> was</i> not, never was and never will be, an anti-vaxxer. He knows that for certain. </p><p><i>But it looks so much like\u2026</i></p><p>Peter groans, eyes glassy. He shuts them and Tony tangles his fingers in his hair and massages his scalp. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, bud.\u201d</p><p>He knows what he has to do. </p><p>Happy picks up on the 11th ring. His disgruntled nature is thrown off when Tony tells him he needs a private jet or chopper or something as soon as possible, as close as possible to his current location. He texts him his co-ordinates and waits for a text back with his ETA.</p><p>3 hours. And he\u2019s bringing Bruce.</p><p>3 hours till medical attention. Around 6 hours till they\u2019re back at the compound. He looks at Peter desperately. He\u2019s tingling all over with adrenaline and fear. He could literally see the kid going downhill.</p><p>The nearest hospital\u2019s much farther than 3 fucking hours. He\u2019d made FRIDAY look into getting something directly to the hospital \u2013 a medical chopper, or something, he didn\u2019t know. Turned out to be 5 hour round trip so he sticks with Bruce and Happy, and a jet with a full medsuite available.</p><p>So they\u2019re stranded till then. </p><p>Things just always seemed to work out that way, didn\u2019t they?</p><p>He sits on the bed beside Peter and holds his hand. Peter squeezes it in what Tony can\u2019t decide is a coping mechanism for the pain, or meant to calm him down until he numbly realises it\u2019s probably both.</p><p>\u201cPeter? I need you to hold on, okay? I\u2019m getting you help. I think\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m really sorry. But you\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Peter gasps. He\u2019s speaking slowly, from the pain in his jaw, and Tony can\u2019t help but let the scary diagnosis word hurl itself against the padded walls of his Crazy House mind over and over.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet.</p><p>They both have their self-prescribed tasks: Tony rubs his thumb over Peter\u2019s knuckles and watches his phone like a hawk. Peter tries to suck it up and swallows back groans and whimpers like there\u2019s no tomorrow. He doesn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Well. </p><p>It <i>is</i> quiet, till Peter speaks.</p><p>He speaks calmly. Matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cMy stomach hurts.\u201d </p><p>Tony straightens, all unsure and nervous. \u201cOkay. Alright. Can I\u2014can I take a look?\u201d </p><p>He raises his pyjama top and rubs his hands together till they\u2019re warm. Peter still sucks in a breath when they make contact.</p><p>He gently \u2013 god, he could not be more gentle if he tried, and it\u2019s still hurting him, <i>he\u2019s</i> still hurting him \u2013 palpates his stomach, and both of them gasp at the same time.</p><p>It\u2019s hard as rock. </p><p>He looks at Peter, fear and definite realisation dawning on him. His heart sinks, thudding in fear for the kid. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Peter rasps. Now his hand\u2019s free from Tony\u2019s hold, it joins his other limbs in sliding sluggishly against the comforter in pain and discomfort as he rides out another wave of flashing cramps. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d </p><p>Tony shakes his head and lowers his shirt. He takes back Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cNothing. You\u2019re okay. It\u2019s alright.\u201d He says fruitlessly. He feels so stupid. He doesn\u2019t know what to do!</p><p>\u201cMr Stark?\u201d</p><p>Tony turns and palms Peter\u2019s face, hoping Peter\u2019s going to ask him to do something for him, to give him <i>something</i> to do to help. \u201cKid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna throw up.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s sitting up and heaving and crying before Tony can grab the trash can, and suddenly he has a sobbing kid covered in vomit and their only bed faring not much better. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s <i>really</i> crying now. He\u2019s holding his stomach and bent over it as much as his neck will allow. </p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNot your fault, Underoos. Not at all. Don\u2019t you worry about it. My job.\u201d He reassures, as warmly as he can. \u201cYou got more?\u201d </p><p>Peter says no. He laughs once. Tony isn\u2019t sure why he laughs, but it\u2019s completely devoid of humour anyway and then rapidly followed by a breathy groan when his jaw disagrees with the action. </p><p>\u201cMaybe talking isn\u2019t a good idea right now, huh, buddy?\u201d Tony suggests, not unkindly. \u201cI would tell you to nod, but uh\u2026\u201d </p><p>Peter settles for the thumbs up/down approach.</p><p>Tony helps him shift so his back\u2019s against the headboard, wedging a pillow between his neck and shoulders so he feels as little pain as possible. </p><p>He strips the comforter from beneath him \u2013 it hasn\u2019t soaked through, thankfully \u00a0- and throws it into the corner. He replaces it with his blanket from the couch. </p><p>Then he finds the washcloth and fills up a bowl of warm water. He cleans up Peter\u2019s face, wiping at the sick and tears and sweat with no sarcastic comment, only soft reassurances.</p><p>Peter\u2019s expression is a mixture of mortified and miserable. He\u2019s still shaking, and once Tony\u2019s eased off his shirt \u2013 something that makes Peter cry out despite his best efforts not to \u2013 he replaces it with one of his own sleep shirts and Peter\u2019s hoodie. </p><p>The pants are a different matter. Peter\u2019s eyes are closed, and he\u2019s breathing deeply like Tony\u2019s told him to. He can\u2019t leave the kid in them, but he doesn\u2019t want to undress him when changing his shirt was the <i>Worst Moment of his Life So Far,</i> according to the kid\u2019s expression. </p><p>He\u2019s giving him a breather from the movement when he notices Peter\u2019s jaw is locked again, and it\u2019s stuck in this sinister sort-of grin that Tony can hardly look at. He does the massaging like he did before until Peter\u2019s mouth is shut. As it closes, he groans loudly and it dissolves into a grimaced set of sobs. </p><p>His eyes are squeezed shut and he knows the kid wants nothing more than to arch his back and neck like he does when he\u2019s hurting, but he can\u2019t. It damn near breaks Tony\u2019s heart.</p><p>He waits for him to open his eyes again, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cUm. Pete?\u201d Peter opens his eyes slowly. \u201cHi. Only me. Uh\u2026 hate to say this, but we\u2019re gonna have to change your pants, kiddo.\u201d He groans. \u201c\u2014I know, I know, Pete. I\u2019m sorry. But I can\u2019t let you sit in it. Your aunt would kill me.\u201d</p><p>Peter uses the hand that isn\u2019t clutching his stomach to give a shaky and reluctant thumbs-up.</p><p>He finds a fresh pair of underwear and a pair of sweats in Peter\u2019s bag and brings them over. Peter swallows forcefully.</p><p>\u201cAaaalrighty. How d\u2019you wanna do this?\u201d </p><p>Peter edges to the edge of the bed, Tony catching on quickly. He wavers, but does manage stay up of his own steam. Tony knows it\u2019s agony for him. \u201cShut your eyes.\u201d He croaks from behind his teeth. </p><p>Tony rolls them, instead. He has one grounding hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPeter, it\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cShut.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know whether that meant <i>shut up</i> or <i>shut your eyes so help me god</i>, but he decides he may as well do both. He\u2019s desperate for Peter to lay down again and though it may not seem like it with some of the pranks he pulls on the kid sometimes, he does give at least <i>half</i> a damn about his dignity. He still has his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder, he figures, so it can\u2019t go too badly wrong.</p><p>Well.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019s S\u2019ark.\u201d </p><p>Tony opens his eyes. Peter\u2019s in his new boxers, but the sweats are on the carpet. He\u2019s looking decidedly <i>worse</i> than ever, and Tony has to stoop and wrap his arms round him for fear of him fainting.</p><p>Peter\u2019s drooling. Tony idly hopes it\u2019s from the lack of movement in his jaw and not because he\u2019s about to toss his cookies again. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 look.\u201d He whispers.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cNot looking.\u201d</p><p>Peter whines softly into his shoulder. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>Tony hushes him, at a complete loss of what to do or say or be. It\u2019s hurting him, too. \u201cWhat can I do, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>His stomach pitches in affection and raw concern. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere, buddy. I\u2019ve invested too much money in you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t laugh. In fact, he doesn\u2019t react at all. His breathing\u2019s calmed, he\u2019s leaning all the more heavier into Tony, and it doesn\u2019t take a genius to knows he\u2019s passed out. </p><p>So he panics.</p><p>He panics, laying him back down and checking his pulse on his neck - \u00a0and then his wrist for good measure. It\u2019s there, strong and maybe a little fast, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s okay. </p><p>He\u2019s still breathing. He double checks that, too, and allows himself to relax. He\u2019s passed out from exertion. From pain, maybe, though he doubts it. Peter\u2019s taken a hell of a lot of pain before and been okay. This is a whole new level. </p><p>Something different.</p><p>Tetanus.</p><p>He\u2019s pretty sure. </p><p>He graciously as possible pulls Peter\u2019s sweats on and some socks after it. It feels a little too much like dressing a dead body for his liking, but he\u2019s checked Peter\u2019s breathing about five times now, and he is. </p><p>He texts Happy to go<i> faster</i> and brings his computer over. He looks up tetanus and frowns. </p><p>He spares the sleeping teen a look. \u201cYou had to go whole-hog, didn\u2019t you. Couldn\u2019t get a head cold like everyone else.\u201d</p><p><i>Fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate\u2026 \u00a0</i></p><p>His fingers rest on Peter\u2019s jumpy pulse point as he reads.</p><p><i>Facial spasms. Difficulty swallowing. Abdominal tenseness.</i></p><p><i>\u2026 can be fatal if not treated quickly.</i></p><p>\u201c<i>O</i>-kay. Yep. Uh-huh. That\u2019s enough of the scary stories.\u201d He slams the laptop shut and sits waiting for the silence to reply to him.</p><p>He checks his watch. Another hour and a half.</p><p>He wipes Peter\u2019s brow, makes sure the hoodie isn\u2019t too thick.</p><p>Paces a little, moves the trash can closer to the bed, carries on pacing. </p><p>All but runs to <i>actually</i> ask Hagrid for a thermometer. He doesn\u2019t have one, so he just grabs some ice from the machine and puts the bucket in the bathtub just in case. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll know when to use it but he feels better knowing it\u2019s there.</p><p>He paces again. Then he stands by the door and holds it open, looking for headlights. Then he paces again. </p><p>He stands with his hands in his pockets and stares at the kid, who\u2019s now stirred enough to reassure him he\u2019s not out cold anymore; though still not getting any kind of <i>peaceful</i> sleep. Bodily sighing, his swipes his foot over the carpet. The fibres flip over and he makes an infinity symbol pattern over and over with the midsole of his shoe. He\u2019s pleased that it took up 2 whole minutes \u2013 only 51 to go.</p><p>He wonders if he should wake him and make him drink some water.</p><p>He packs both their things up and puts the bags by the door. He paces just a little more because his feet are buzzing from inactivity.</p><p>He decides he <i>should</i> wake the kid. He decides against it. He decides against the deciding against it. He makes some coffee and doesn\u2019t drink any of it. </p><p>He wishes, and wishes, and wishes again he hadn\u2019t taken the kid on this trip.</p><p>He hopes to god he\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>Peter lets out a hushed, crackly, <i>heartbreaking </i>whine from the back of his throat. Tony re-wets the washcloth and moves the trash can a little closer. He sits and cups his cheek. It feels like a placebo method of willing his temperature down, but he\u2019ll take anything over feeling completely useless.</p><p>When his phone starts to ring with 32 minutes left, he almost jumps out of his skin. He drops Peter\u2019s hand and moves to the kitchenette to answer. \u201cGimme good news, Hogan.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cDriving to you now. How\u2019s he doing?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThank God. He\u2019s asleep. How long till you\u2019re here? Bruce there? Tell him it\u2019s tetanus. I mean\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s tetanus now. Though I\u2019m open alternative diagnoses. My pride can take the hit.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cJesus, Tony\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNavigation thing says 12 minutes. See you in 8. Yes, Bruce is here.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHolding you to 8. Drive safe. Drive fast.\u201d</p><p>7 minutes later, a dishevelled Bruce is jumping out of a blue Audi, dragging his medcase with him. Tony waves, and he jogs over. </p><p>\u201cHi, Tony.\u201d He says. Tony doesn\u2019t know how Bruce manages to sound apologetic in everything he says, but he can and does.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for coming.\u201d He ushers him in and Bruce heads straight for the bed. He gasps when he feels Peter\u2019s forehead, and he looks at Tony, an appalled look on his face. </p><p>\u201cPlease. Help him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. Tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Tony regales the entire story to Bruce as he inflates a blood pressure cuff and waits for his temperature to take. He doesn\u2019t look impressed when the readings come through onto a device he\u2019s holding.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Tetanus? Or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, tetanus or <i>not</i>, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s taking advantage of his enhanced state. I\u2019ve never seen something this serious advance so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what does that mean? Is he gonna recover quicker? Is he dying?\u201d Tony babbles. Bruce just shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Tony doesn\u2019t have the gall to ask which question he\u2019s answering. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re right. I\u2019m gonna give him the tetanus antitoxin and set up an IV now. He needs to be back on the jet.\u201d</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t look away when the huge needle pierces his arm, or when the IV goes into his hand. He stands there, helpless and hapless and a complete fucking idiot who\u2019s going to let his kid die because he couldn\u2019t recognise tetanus if it slapped him in the face.</p><p>He <i>feels</i> like he\u2019s been slapped in the face.</p><p>\u201cCan you carry him?\u201d Bruce is looking at him like he\u2019s said this question already. Tony nods, gormless. Bruce nods back. \u201cI\u2019ve given him a short-acting barbiturate sedation to keep him out till the jet at least. This is going to hurt his neck, so be gentle, Tony, be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Tony is gentle. He hugs the kid to him for the entire tense car ride \u2013 Happy breaking the speed limit what feels like twice over, Bruce taking readings and feeling Peter\u2019s neck and jaw and stomach whilst holding an IV up in the air.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d have been able to breathe a sigh of relief when he got Peter onto the medbay bed, but he just\u2026 can\u2019t.</p><p>Can\u2019t breathe. </p><p>He watches wires and nurses swamp his kid from his freakout corner. They take his blood to look for anything else \u2013 though Bruce is almost adamant it\u2019s tetanus by now, and he\u2019s injecting Peter with needle after needle of antibiotics. They get to work on his jaw and neck, doing stuff that Tony has no idea how to explain.</p><p>They cut through his hoodie and place cooling gel packs on him. Tony shifts on his feet, because Peter really liked that old hoodie, and he knows his guilt will force him to trawl <i>eBay</i> for another lookalike till he finds another one for the poor kid.</p><p>It won\u2019t be the same. The lettering won\u2019t be faded and the drawstring won\u2019t be missing and it won\u2019t smell like the rest of May\u2019s laundry\u2014</p><p>May.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to call the kid\u2019s aunt.\u201d He murmurs to nobody in particular. He slips out of the room.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. Again, he\u2019s surprised to not be relieved at all. The <i>leave a message after the beep</i> beep beeps and he stares at the wall. </p><p>\u201cMay. It\u2019s me. I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could give me a call back as soon as you can. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>His screen lights up with her name a second later. </p><p><i>\u201cTony?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMay.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTony, what\u2019s happened? Are you okay? Is Peter?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAre you sitting down?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me. Tell me right now.\u201d</i></p><p>He gulps. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s not okay. He\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick? <i>Oh, my god. What\u2019s wrong with him? Can I speak to him?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 well, we\u2019re not 100% yet. Tests are coming back in soon. But we think\u2026 May, we think it\u2019s tetanus.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cTetanus? Oh, my god. My poor baby. Tetanus? Tony, it can\u2019t be tetanus. I got him immunised. I\u2014I made sure he got all his boosters! He hasn\u2019t been bit by any feral animals or\u2014how do you even get it? What\u2019s happening to him? Where are you? I need to see my baby.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI believe you got him vaccinated. And it doesn\u2019t have to be through an animal bite. I don\u2019t really know how else, I only Googled it for a second. Dirt? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThe mud run\u2026\u201d</i> May breathes. Tony straightens. She\u2019s right.</p><p>Peter ran a charity mud run <i>twice</i> a few days ago. Once as Peter Parker, once as Spider-Man. The kid only needed one small cut, or to have accidentally ingested some of the dirt, and it\u2019d be straight to Tetanus Town. Especially with a healing factor like his \u2013 anything that got into a cut Peter had would be sealed in within the hour. </p><p>\u201cGod, I think you\u2019re right. FRIDAY, let Bruce know.\u201d He sits down on the edge of a plush seat. \u201cAnd he\u2019s asleep right now. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in any pain, at least.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s been in a lot of pain?\u201d</i> May asks quietly.</p><p>Tony steadies his hand by shoving it between his knees. \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t realise soon enough what was going on. It\u2019s my fault. His neck was hurting, and his jaw seized up at one point. He threw up on himself, and I\u2026 he had a dizzy spell, for god\u2019s sake, and I didn\u2019t <i>realise.</i>\u201d He only just holds back from saying <i>and now it might be too late.</i></p><p>May is silent. <i>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cOn a jet back to the compound. I can send a car to pick you up when we\u2019re an hour out.\u201d He says. He can sense her anger at him, and he actually wants to see her so he can be chewed out.</p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can drive myself.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, May.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019m going to be getting any more <i>in loco parentis</i> opportunities anytime soon.\u201d He can\u2019t quite keep the self-reproach out of his deadpan tone.</p><p><i>\u201cTony. I know my nephew. I know what he\u2019s like. I know you look after him. You\u2019re on a private jet, are you not? I\u2019m assuming you cleaned up vomit from him, did you not? Tony, this wasn\u2019t your fault. Trust me. I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m just scared. I\u2019m\u2026 really in the dark here.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when Bruce knows more. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cOkay. If he wakes up, tell him I love him and I\u2019ll be waiting for him when you land, okay?\u201d</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s heart twists. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t even hung up before Happy comes in, foregoing knocking. \u201cHe\u2019s coming round.\u201d</p><hr><p>Peter comes round all at once. He shouts out in agony, and Bruce leaps to dole out the analgesia. Tony cups his cheek instantly, blocking his eyes from roaming around the darkened room. \u201cHey. Look at me, kiddo. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re alright. Bruce is gonna help you.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s lip is trembling. A tear\u2019s path gets cut off by Tony\u2019s hand, and he uses his middle finger to wipe them away. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here, okay? Where you can see me.\u201d</p><p>Bruce nods at him. </p><p>\u201cNow, listen, Pete. We don\u2019t know how yet, but you\u2019ve contracted tetanus. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it in biology class. It\u2019s not fun, and I\u2019m really so sorry it\u2019s happened like this. But I <i>promise</i> you we\u2019re gonna get you better.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stands behind Peter\u2019s head, shaking a vial of something. He pauses when Tony doesn\u2019t continue and meets his eyes. <i>Tell him what I told you.</i></p><p>Tony looks down sadly. Peter\u2019s eyes are wide and bright from the tears and pain, watching him steadily.</p><p>\u201cI do promise you we\u2019ll fix this. But I also\u2026 I can\u2019t lie to you. It\u2019s not gonna be easy, Pete. You got the facial spasms, right? And your stomach hurt?\u201d He placed a gentle hand on Peter\u2019s stomach and rubbed as gently as possible. Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered shut. \u201cWell, now your jaw\u2019s locked into place. And it\u2019ll keep advancing till you\u2019re having these sort-of\u2026 god, Peter I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re gonna have these\u2026 Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Peter.\u201d Bruce moves into the frame of Peter\u2019s eyeline. \u201cWhat Tony\u2019s trying to say is that your muscles are going to go into spasm all over your body. It\u2019ll be like having a seizure. I\u2019m giving you as much pain relief as I can. It\u2019s\u2026 really not fun. Sorry, kid.\u201d</p><p>Tony takes his hand. \u201cPeter, how bad is the pain out of ten? Squeeze.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes ten times.</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart breaks into another million pieces with each weak clasp.</p><p>Bruce stares at him, waiting for a number. </p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw, I\u2019m sorry Peter.\u201d </p><p>It\u2019s somehow horrible to not hear Peter say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d </p><p>If he\u2019s honest, it\u2019s horrible not to hear anything at all. The balance is all off. He\u2019s never craved one of Peter\u2019s nerdy, trip-over-your-words rants more than right now.</p><p>Bruce ups the morphine dosage a little higher and goes about prepping the most effective diazepam formula for Peter\u2019s oncoming seizures. Tony carries on trying to calm him.</p><p>\u201cOh. And I talked to your aunt.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes fly open at that \u2013 Tony can see in them that if he could have, he\u2019d have asked about May. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there when we land. She told me to say \u2018I love you\u2019. Not me. Her. I don\u2019t love you. You know I\u2019ve always found you to be a chronic menace.\u201d Tony huffs a tired laugh and runs his hand through Peter\u2019s hair, leaving it there as a comforting gesture. Peter eyelids slide shut again.</p><p>The next three hours go about as smoothly as Tony had expected. </p><p>Peter graduates from a nasal cannula to a loud, invasive oxygen mask that he very clearly doesn\u2019t like. The second it\u2019s on, his hands are balling up and he\u2019s crying. One of them eventually fumbles for Tony\u2019s.</p><p>He ends up knowing every line and hair on them intimately, as it stays firmly grasped in his for the rest of the flight. If he loosens his grip, Peter\u2019s fingers flounder and the guilt swallows him whole.</p><p>The diazepam works well to slow down the body tremors for a while, but they really set off just as they\u2019re banking to land. </p><p>It\u2019s horrific. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes are open, darting around and terrified. His entire body seizes at once, his torso, arms and legs aggressively jerking inwards every second or so. It looks like some kind of demonic possession in a horror movie, and Tony wants nothing more than to look away. To just let it pass. He\u2019s <i>never </i>wanted something to end so much in his entire life. And he\u2019s been captured and tortured by terrorists. </p><p>But he\u2019s seen awful things before, and he likes to think he can handle anything like a mature adult. He\u2019s a superhero, for god\u2019s sake. He can do this.</p><p>Especially for Peter.</p><p>Peter\u2019s strong. He\u2019s stronger than Tony could ever be. </p><p>But\u2026 he\u2019s still a kid. And he\u2019s terrified, and he\u2019s in agony.</p><p>So he whispers to the kid, whether he can hear him or not, strokes his cheek, hums to him, cards his hand through his sweaty hair. </p><p>Bruce squeezes his shoulder as he rushes past. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Tony. Keep doing that, okay?\u201d</p><p>He cannot imagine the pain Peter\u2019s in. He asks for him to be sedated, but Bruce sadly explains that with Peter\u2019s enhanced state, they need him awake. They don\u2019t know how fast this thing is gonna progress, and they need to monitor his alertness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re landing now, buddy. Not too long. Get you down to the compound and get you fixed right up. Be back to doing backflips off the Empire State and scaring the hell out of me in no time.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes his hand hard in between jolts. \u201cI know, Pete. I know.\u201d</p><hr><p>May goes almost\u2026 <i>green</i> when she sees Peter. They\u2019re pushing him on the stretcher into the med bay, which she\u2019s sat outside of, ripping up an old receipt into little pieces that fall into her purse.</p><p>Peter\u2019s whole body is jolting again and again and again like he\u2019s being electrocuted and there are wires going everywhere, and the big scary oxygen mask dwarfs his face. He\u2019s making a broken keening sound in the back of his throat, which heightens when Tony reluctantly lets go of his hand to give the team room to work around him. They disappear through the medbay doors, one of them requesting they give them some time to stabilise him.</p><p>May is frozen, standing there with her purse on the ground. Pieces of receipt are scattered everywhere.</p><p>Her head turns and she stares at him with big eyes. </p><p>She looks worn ragged with worry. </p><p>Tony guesses he doesn\u2019t look much different.</p><p>\u201cHe just started going downhill\u2026\u201d he supplies uselessly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him?\u201d </p><p>Tony just looks back at her. May is the kind of woman whose entire composure begs you not to fuck with her. Or lie to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Hopefully get better.\u201d He feels the last word come out as an empty laugh, and he drops down into one of the chairs, head in hands. His neck twinges, and he automatically imagines how Peter\u2019s must feel. \u201cSorry, May. Just gimme a sec.\u201d</p><p>He feels the seat next to him dip down. \u201cIf anyone can get through this, it\u2019s him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t <i>have</i> to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is. And there\u2019s nothing we can do to reverse that.\u201d May says sternly. Then her voice softens. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Tony. And you know if he could, he\u2019d tell you that. He\u2019d hate to think you were upset over him. You know what he\u2019s like, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony tilts his head to look up at her. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult not to feel accountable. That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d He shrugs and claps his hands together.</p><p>May\u2019s expression is empathetic and warm. It\u2019s never been more clear to him where Peter gets it from. </p><p>\u201cYou look like you could use a shower and one hell of a coffee IV. Go. Your FRIDAY voice thing can tell you if we\u2019re allowed in to see him, right?\u201d </p><p>Tony nods. Although it was a suggestion, he can\u2019t help but feel that May has ordered it. \u201cYeah. Alright.\u201d</p><p>He stands to leave, but so does May. She puts a hand on his shoulder. He turns, surprised. </p><p>She kisses his cheek. \u201cThank you. For looking after him. He\u2019d be lost without you.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes fill a little \u2013 his eyes flit up and down her face and he swallows. She nods at him, squeezes his shoulder and heads towards the coffee machine. He watches her go and marvels at how amazing women are. </p><p>He holds that thought the whole time he showers, as he shaves and as he gets dressed. </p><p>The sentiment grows and blooms in his chest, warm, as Pepper comes in and straightens the wrinkles from his t-shirt. She evaluates his face, hands either side of it, and presses a soft kiss to his lips. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that question with a fiery burning passion.\u201d He kisses her again and they wrap around each other. </p><p>Pepper gives him a look and goes to sit with May when they\u2019re leaving his room to find Steve, Nat, Clint and Wanda waiting in the living area for news. They all look expectantly up as he enters, and Tony tenses up till he reads the sympathy in their stances.</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s sent me 4 texts about him.\u201d Steve huffs a laugh. Tony smiles.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be ecstatic to hear that.\u201d Tony knows Peter thinks Sam Wilson is about the coolest guy on the planet. He\u2019s pretty sure the feeling is mutual, especially ever since Sam found out that Peter had chosen to write an essay on him, specifically on his work as a PTSD counsellor. </p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s okay?\u201d Wanda asks.</p><p>Tony sighs. Their faces fall. \u201cNo. He\u2019s not good right now. Bruce says it is tetanus, and he\u2019s given him the antitoxin, and the antibiotics, and the anticonvulsants\u2026 he\u2019s had about every anti under the sun at this point, but\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cHis enhanced healing isn\u2019t working?\u201d Nat asks.</p><p>Tony shakes his head, holding up his hand to lazily point at her in agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the kid get so much as a runny nose before, let alone tetanus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez. Tetanus. It\u2019s rough.\u201d Clint mutters, looking angry. Clint\u2019s the kinda guy to issue a death threat against tetanus itself. Tony wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he succeeded, either.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything we can do?\u201d Steve asks tentatively.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know what <i>I</i> can do, Rogers.\u201d Tony murmurs. \u201cJust\u2026 <i>when</i> he gets better,\u201d they all nod enthusiastically at his wishful wording, \u201ccome visit him? Kid loves hanging out with you losers, for some reason.\u201d He smiles at them, knowing that exhaustion and anxiety are blatant on his face. </p><p>They all smile softly and nod, agreeing unequivocally. Tony jerks his head back at them. \u201cThanks, folks. Does, uh, anyone else want coffee? I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss, Dr Banner\u2019s about to speak to May Parker.\u201d </p><p>\u201cScratch that. Make your own coffee, I guess, you lazy schmucks.\u201d</p><p>Tony Stark doesn\u2019t run anywhere unless there\u2019s a fire behind him or a single-malt scotch ahead of him, but he can\u2019t really in good faith deny that he didn\u2019t jog down to medical.</p><p>Bruce is waiting for him, May no longer there. </p><p>Bruce always looks tired so he has to take a second to digest the dark bags under the man\u2019s eyes as he approaches him. \u201cHi, Tony.\u201d</p><p>Tony puts his hand on his shoulder. \u201cD\u2019you wanna sit?\u201d</p><p>Bruce hesitates. He says, \u201cYeah. I could sit.\u201d like Tony\u2019s offering to take him for dinner.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me straight, doc.\u201d </p><p>He squeezes his palms together till his fingers go white waiting for the bad news. The room seems to go silent as the world-ending fear he\u2019s been fighting off since May relegated him to the shower crashes down onto his chest. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gonna die. And his last word\u2019s gonna be \u201cStay.\u201d </p><p>And it\u2019s gonna play over in Tony\u2019s mind forever. The way he said it, so desperate and agonised and terrified. </p><p>He thinks he\u2019s gonna throw up till Bruce goes, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d, and he exhales like a storm wind.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank god. Bruce. Thank you. Thank you so much. I don\u2019t\u2014if you hadn\u2019t\u2014oh, thank <i>god.\u201d</i></p><p>Bruce chuckles. \u201cI gave him both chlorpromazine and the diazepam and it stopped the convulsions. He\u2019s got everything he needs now. Scans are showing that his body \u2013 you know, his enhanced metabolism and the healing factor \u2013 they\u2019re reacting well to it \u2013 I didn\u2019t have enough antibiotics or antitoxins on the plane to combat it properly but now I do, and it\u2019s turning itself around.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s shaking his head at him, grinning. \u201cI could kiss you. You know what?\u201d He takes Bruce\u2019s head in both hands and smacks his forehead with a big kiss. \u201cI can and did. You beautiful man. Thank you, Brucie. You\u2019re a myth and a legend.\u201d</p><p>Bruce blushes and smiles. He was never good at being complimented. \u201cYou can see him if you like. I didn\u2019t sedate him, but he\u2019s asleep anyway. I can still keep an eye on his brain activity that way. He isn\u2019t in nearly as much pain, either. That\u2014that was a priority.\u201d</p><p>For a second, Tony considers the fact that there in fact very well may be a god.</p><hr><p>Peter doesn\u2019t sleep for long. He\u2019s slept more in the past couple days than he probably has in the last month, and although the pain is lessened, it still can\u2019t be pleasant enough to let him stay out for long.</p><p>Tony just sends up his thanks that he\u2019s not seizing anymore. </p><p>Bruce does some simple tests on him and seems satisfied. </p><p>May is there, and she sits beside his head as he groggily turns into her thigh. She whispers to him, and he squeezes her hand to let her know he\u2019s alright. She cries a little at first, murmuring, \u201cHey, baby. Hello, Petey. Does it hurt? I know you\u2019re hurting, baby.\u201d to him and this makes him move even closer into her. He rubs her hand clumsily.</p><p>It\u2019s a reflection of exactly what she\u2019s been doing whilst he slept, and Tony once again can\u2019t help but think on how much they\u2019ve rubbed off on each other.</p><p>But then she mentions that he\u2019s in a hospital, and the realisation that he\u2019s not at home must break through the fog of his sleepy mind, because he sort-of comes to himself. </p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t you move that neck of yours, Peter Parker.\u201d May warns. Unsettled, Peter tries to swallow and gags on it, and she gingerly strokes his throat to calm him down. \u201cI\u2019m here. Tony\u2019s here. Okay? You\u2019re safe and you\u2019re getting looked after, and,\u201d she lowers her tone and catches his cheek to get his full attention, \u201cthe more you stress out, the longer it\u2019ll take for you to get better. You\u2019ve been really sick, baby. I was scared.\u201d</p><p>He gasps twice, convulsively, then settles. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, honey. You\u2019ll set Tony off too. You know what he\u2019s like.\u201d She looks up at him and winks. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t really know what Peter\u2019s doing when he eases his right hand out of May\u2019s hold and replaces it with his left, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to grab it when it\u2019s held out behind him expectantly. \u201cYep, I\u2019m here, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeezes it for a long while. Tony does it back, two quick squeezes like his mom used to do to his knee when he needed reassurance. </p><p>His skin is pale and cold. \u201cDamn, kid! Cold heart, cold hands, huh? Hold on, Ice Queen Elsa.\u201d Tony blows warm air onto it and he swears he sees the corner of Peter\u2019s mouth twitch up beneath the new, smaller, <i>quieter </i>oxygen mask. </p><p>\u201cBruce says he thinks he\u2019ll have his voice back by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour healing factor just needed a nudge in the right direction, huh?\u201d Tony asks Peter, who had been looking up at both at them as they chatted quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s basically what he said, yeah.\u201d May smiles. \u201cWell, at least now he\u2019s been humbled to the trials and tribulations of us <i>normies</i> without our super duper fancy healing powers.\u201d She teases. </p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have gotten something a little less dramatic, next time, could he? I already have a heart condition.\u201d Peter crushes his hand fiercely. Tony pats it with his other hand, laughing. \u201cKidding, kid. But, seriously, please don\u2019t do that again. I know you\u2019ll be desperate to repeat this fun experience, but I can\u2019t take it.\u201d May nods meaningfully at Peter, eyebrows raised. Tony sighs. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d better go and get all that stuff done that Pepper\u2019s been hounding me about. You\u2019re staying here?\u201d He asks May.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Got my four poster.\u201d She jerks her head to the cot behind her. \u201c5 stars, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there\u2019s a room here for you when he\u2019s better. <i>Real</i> four poster.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI expect nothing less, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony presses his knuckles to Peter\u2019s temple and murmurs his goodbyes, then heads out. He doesn\u2019t want to go, but May\u2019s there, and he\u2019s sure they can do with some privacy.</p><p>Turns out that Pepper\u2019s first and only Big Task for him is to get some shuteye. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t even try to fight her on it.</p><hr><p>Very early the next morning, FRIDAY tells him May is heading to shower, so he heads down. </p><p>Bruce is intercepting a nurse who\u2019s carrying a fresh catheter drainage bag. He takes it from her and smiles, then sees Tony and waves. He\u2019s wearing the white coat he normally wears in the lab, with the addition of a stethoscope and the fact that it\u2019s<i> clean</i> for once.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, all rested and professional. Look at this!\u201d He flicks the drum of the stethoscope. \u201cDashing. God, you better watch out you don\u2019t get done for fraud. Anyone would think those PhDs were actually in medicine.\u201d</p><p>Bruce laughs at that. \u201cWell\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing? He speaking yet?\u201d</p><p>Bruce shakes his head. \u201cNot yet. He\u2019s responding well to everything we\u2019re giving him. Basically everything bothering him now is from the neck upwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going in the right direction? Sounds like it\u2019s basically put itself into rewind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s it. The only thing is that his blood pressure\u2019s kind of unstable. It\u2019s giving him some vertigo and a bad headache, so I\u2019m not going to reduce the analgesia yet. I get the feeling his pain tolerance is\u2026 one to be matched. His heart rate\u2019s still high and he seems a bit\u2014\u201d he mimes moving a stiff neck, \u201creluctant to move it, you know? But I don\u2019t really have a reason to believe that won\u2019t right itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Cool. That\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go in - and take this. I\u2019ll be with you soon.\u201d Tony takes the catheter bag and pushes through the doors. </p><p>Peter still looks sick as a dog, but he\u2019s on the nasal cannula now, and he seems to be in a more comfortable position. </p><p>The head of the bed has been raised somewhat, so he sees Tony when he enters. He waves at him dopily, and it makes Tony grin.</p><p>\u201cHey! Kid! The Ban-man says you\u2019re feeling a little better. That\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>Peter can manage more of a smile now. It\u2019s all lopsided, and it looks funny and heart-warming all at once. </p><p>Once Tony\u2019s sat beside him, cross-legged and beaming back, he seems satisfied enough to close his eyes. </p><p>\u201cBruce says you\u2019ve been getting some vertigo. Dizzy, huh?\u201d Peter quirks another half-smile in confirmation.</p><p>He suddenly remembers being back on the highway, Peter hunched over himself as he tries not to pass out. His chest tightens and he looks long and hard at the kid.</p><p>Peter opens an eye and looks at him. They share a look for a while before Tony speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re sick, kiddo.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes narrow. They practically <i>scream</i> at him not to apologise. Tony snickers. He can\u2019t wait to be berated by the kid when he finally gets his voice back. </p><p>In all honesty, he can\u2019t wait.</p><p>He chuckles again when Peter doesn\u2019t stop glaring. \u201cOkay, alright! No more self-pitying. God, you\u2019re mean. That\u2019s my favourite pastime.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes roll up into his eyelids as they close. \u201cI can<i> taste</i> the sarcasm on your tongue, kiddo. How can you do that when you can\u2019t even speak? Kids are so weird and moody these days.\u201d</p><p>Peter quirks an eyebrow without opening his eyes. Tony sighs and ruffles his hair. \u201cGet some more sleep, Pete.\u201d He earns a thumbs-up for that.</p><p>The room is quiet for a while. It\u2019s not an awkward one, but comfortable \u2013 like when they\u2019d been driving only a week ago and they\u2019d both fallen into companionable silence. Tony relishes it.</p><p>He decides he may as well relax too. He leans back in his chair, arms crossed, and shuts his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGotta admit, s\u2019a bit weird that <i>you</i> brought in th\u2019bag th\u2019s gunna hold my pee. Think unnerving is th\u2019word.\u201d</p><p>The next second, Tony\u2019s jumping out of his skin so high he thinks he\u2019ll be a naked skeleton for the rest of his life, and Peter\u2019s laughing his whispery, croaking laugh that is nothing but music to his ears.</p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Mis\u2019r</i> <i>S\u2019ark</i>!\u201d Peter mimics back. He\u2019s sick, and he\u2019s shaky, and his voice is weak and quiet, but he\u2019s <i>smiling</i>. Really <i>smiling.</i> Tony is grinning like a fool back at him.</p><p>He leans forward and gathers the kid in his arms for a cautious hug. \u201cYou little scoundrel!\u201d</p><p>Peter hugs him back harder than Tony\u2019s hugging him, and he pushes his nose into his neck. \u201cS\u2019rry, man. C\u2019d\u2019nt resist.\u201d</p><p>When they lean back, Peter\u2019s smile has changed. It\u2019s a quiet kind of smile. \u201cThanks f\u2019r lookin\u2019 out f\u2019r me, Mis\u2019r S\u2019ark. And\u2026 s\u2019rry f\u2019r scarin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome kid. Just\u2026 no repeats, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and then winces. He laughs at himself whilst Tony scowls at his pain. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. M\u2019okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout as okay as you can be, all things considered, I guess. How\u2019s the headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll move you down.\u201d He grabs the control and lowers the head of the bed. \u201cBit better?\u201d Peter sends him another thumbs up. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>The same calm quiet comes back, but Tony doesn\u2019t settle down again. He watches Peter\u2019s vitals for a while, then the kid himself. He\u2019s not sleeping, he knows he\u2019s feeling a little too unwell to settle down completely. But he doesn\u2019t feel that same sinking hopelessness in his stomach anymore. </p><p>\u201cHey. M\u2019s\u2019r S\u2019rk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Say, \u2018yes, P\u2019t\u2019r?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, P\u2019t\u2019r?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Shh</i>. Properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2019D\u2019n\u2019t be a pain \u2018n th\u2019neck.\u2019</i> Remember? <i>Foreshad\u2019wing.</i>\u201d He says reverently.

                "content": "<p>THIS PROMPT TOOK OVER MY LIFE BUT I LOVE YOU FOR IT!!!! Thank you sm!!!</p><p>(I am sO very much not a doctor in any way so please pretend I know what I&rsquo;m talking about and that this is actually convincing!)</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15674718\">this fic on ao3</a></p><hr /><p>Driving long distances wasn&rsquo;t really Tony&rsquo;s thing. </p><p>Being a man of ample wealth &ndash; not to mention a distinct lack of affinity with &lsquo;scenic routes&rsquo; comprised entirely of cornfields &ndash; &nbsp;made it a pretty basic principal: when a private jet is an option, you don&rsquo;t say no.</p><p>That, and the fact that he&rsquo;s pretty sure he has some nice internalised trauma in the back somewhere from his parents dying in a car, or something. Shut up. Whatever. Road trips weren&rsquo;t his thing.</p><p>Go figure. <br /><br />So to say he was surprised to find himself openly offering to cart one Peter Parker to <i>California </i>and back? That would be an understatement. </p><p>45 hours of driving. Both ways. 90 hours.</p><p>Oh, what the hell. Was he really that surprised? He loves the kid. </p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t going to college for another couple years, but the kid could&rsquo;ve been there a long time ago. It was only natural that he was interested in the top universities the country had to offer; Stanford and Berkeley being right up there, and easily within his academic sights.</p><p>Tony had somehow managed to get May&rsquo;s pride complex to share a room with his desire to sponsor Peter a full ride. She&rsquo;d heard him out, and the whole time he was speaking, he could see the conflict on her face.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t want charity. Even the implication of it made her squirm.</p><p>But she loved Peter, and she wanted him to achieve his full potential. Though her and Ben had accepted the fact a long time ago, it was still awful that they had to mortgage what felt like everything, from the roof over their head to the air in their lungs, to nurture Peter&rsquo;s gifts. </p><p>And here was Tony, offering him everything he deserved and more. It wouldn&rsquo;t make even a dent in Tony&rsquo;s bank balance, and it was clear he was offering out of love and care for her nephew, and nothing else. No ulterior motive, no sleazy need to sedate a guilty conscience.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t like she hadn&rsquo;t seen Peter trying to hide the Stanford prospectus under his hamper, the Yale webpage that was hastily closed when she walked past.</p><p>So she said yes. </p><p>And Peter was really grateful, and<i> really</i> happy. </p><p>They&rsquo;d been in the lab, working on something or other &ndash; web fluid and shooters, maybe &ndash; and Peter had been talking about California. Stanford, specifically. And how May was stressing about booking time off for an open day. </p><p>&ldquo;I could take you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t worry about it Mr Stark, it&rsquo;s cool! She&rsquo;ll just have to do some make-up graveyard shifts, and I was gonna help out by&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;FRI, compare the open day dates. Am I free?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You and Ms Potts are in Stockholm between the 5th July and 17th August. The visitor centre isn&rsquo;t open outside of those dates.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So no dice?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No dice, Boss.&rdquo;</p><p>Though Peter had politely rejected the idea, Tony could&rsquo;ve sworn his face fell just a little. He cleared his throat and threw a grape into his mouth, leaning back in his chair and considering. </p><p>After a minute or so of the kid side-eyeing him from his bubbling formula, he threw a grape at Peter&rsquo;s head to get his attention, then stared off into space innocently, pretending he hadn&rsquo;t thrown it. </p><p>&ldquo;They know me at Stanford. I&rsquo;ve got sway. <i>And</i> Berkeley, I think.&rdquo; He shrugged, pointing at the ceiling. &ldquo;Hit me with it, FRIDAY.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got honorary alumni status at both, Boss.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grinned at Peter like all his problems were solved. &ldquo;Really! <i>Aces</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;Mr Stark, I&hellip; you know how thankful I am to you for funding me this scholarship, and all, and I am! Really. It&rsquo;s&hellip; it means so much to me. And May. But I can&rsquo;t just ask you to fly me out there on top of everything else&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said anything about flying? Are you putting words in my mouth again, Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! I&rsquo;ve never put&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a pain in the neck! We could make it a fun little road trip - take the Audi. I know it&rsquo;s your favourite. Stop at a hotel, do some sightseeing. You&rsquo;ve never been to San Francisco, you can be a disgusting tourist!&rdquo; Peter crossed his arms and rolled his eyes, not even trying to conceal his smile. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, it&rsquo;ll be fun! It&rsquo;d be a week, tops. And I can make up for being in Sweden for most of your summer.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled at him softly. &ldquo;<i>Usually</i> it&rsquo;s the kid begging the adult to let them do something crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, whoa there. Foolish, perhaps. Eccentric, possibly. But crazy? You&rsquo;re toeing the line, there, kid.&rdquo; He stood and moved to Peter&rsquo;s workstation, flopping into his chair and pouting dramatically. &ldquo;Come oooon. You never do anything fun with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed. &ldquo;Mr <i>Stark</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stuck his bottom lip out further and stirred the web fluid concoction sadly. &ldquo;Never wants to spend time with me.&rdquo; He muttered. &ldquo;Always with Ned. Never with Mr Stark.&rdquo; He sighed, slumping his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Peter laughed. &ldquo;Fine! We can go.&rdquo; </p><p>They both knew he&rsquo;d been in from the second Tony had suggested it.</p><hr /><p><i>whoa dude im so jealous!!!! Facetime me when youre at the hotel and tell me about it!!</i><br /></p><p>Tony smirks to himself as he brings his eyes back to the road. That was Ned&rsquo;s reply to Peter&rsquo;s earlier text of, &lsquo;<i>best trip ever!!!!&rsquo;</i>, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel just a little bit smug about it.</p><p>He&rsquo;s feeling more sad than smug, though. He and Peter&rsquo;d had a really fun time, and he&rsquo;s a little disappointed it&rsquo;s over so soon. They&rsquo;d had pretty much unprecedented tours of Berkeley and Stanford, which Peter had loved (though he didn&rsquo;t envy Peter of the future, having to pick one of all these colleges that&rsquo;d have him at the drop of a hat). </p><p>Then they&rsquo;d had a couple days just here and there, sightseeing and relaxing and eating good food, staying in a nice hotel in San Francisco that made Peter bounce on the balls of his feet in excitement at the luxury.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony received a selfie off him in his bath tub, up to the eyeballs in bubbles and a champagne flute of orange juice in his hand.</p><p>A squirrel had tried to basically mug Peter of his pretzels in Golden Gate Park. Tony couldn&rsquo;t with 100% certainty guarantee that May hadn&rsquo;t been immediately sent a perfectly timed photo of the attack, or that she wasn&rsquo;t framing multiple copies at that very moment. God, he couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d laughed so hard.</p><p>Chuckling under his breath at the memory, he looks over at the kid, who&rsquo;s fast asleep beside him. His smile turns at the corners into a grimace when he sees the position Peter&rsquo;s in &ndash; slumped forward, his neck at a weird angle. </p><p>Peter had mentioned yesterday that his neck and jaw had been a bit stiff and sore. Tony had joked that he was probably sleeping on the ceiling <i>just because he could</i>, and that was why his neck was playing up.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter had laughed, said something about taking a hit on patrol. From then on, Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but notice every time Peter rubbed his mouth or winced slightly at a movement, and had resolved to take the suit in for upgrades; starting with more head and neck support.<br /></p><p>It couldn&rsquo;t have been bothering him too much, if the vigour with which he took up the role of slack-jawed tourist was anything to go by.</p><p>Well, at least he didn&rsquo;t have to worry about <i>why</i> the kid&rsquo;s healing factor wasn&rsquo;t fixing up the injury &ndash; sleep like <i>that</i> and it was no wonder his neck was all strained.&nbsp;</p><p>He looks like some kind of creepy contortionist, head flopped forward and twisted towards the window. He&rsquo;s only restrained by the seatbelt &ndash; otherwise he&rsquo;d be faceplanting the dash for sure. </p><p>Boy, was he out of it. Had he maybe overdone it with the touristy things?</p><p><i>Nah. </i></p><p>Kid loved it. </p><p>&ldquo;Someone gets you in one spot for longer than 30 seconds one time and you pull a Sleeping Beauty.&rdquo; He softly grouses. Peter&rsquo;s knowledge of good health habits &ndash; namely that you <i>actually have to sleep every once in a blue moon</i> &ndash; is shockingly poor for a kid genius. He focuses back on the road for a split second before his head whips back. &ldquo;I only called you Beauty to get the reference right. It&rsquo;s not a compliment. Don&rsquo;t get cocky.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t stir. Tony sighs, leaning over to push him back against the seat with one hand against his chest. Once he&rsquo;s there and the seatbelt is more lax, he tries to ease his head back a little, withdrawing suddenly, fingers curling at the surprise heat he finds on Peter&rsquo;s brow. </p><p>He coughs under his breath, confusion spreading under his features. He corrects the car&rsquo;s course an inch to the left, thankful they&rsquo;re on a straight, almost empty highway, and presses his entire hand to Peter&rsquo;s forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>El scorchio.</i> Peter? Hey, Parker, rise and shine.&rdquo; He shakes Peter&rsquo;s shoulder whilst staring at the road, awkwardness now for some reason filling up inside him. </p><p>Peter grunts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m up, I&rsquo;m up.&rdquo; He exhales long and slow out of his nose and rubs his eyes and neck, hissing at the latter like Tony had expected him to.</p><p>He squeezes one eye shut and twists his features to the left as he pointlessly tries to inspect his neck. He must agitate his sore jaw doing this, because he hisses again. Tony stares ahead at the road. </p><p>&ldquo;Aw man. I didn&rsquo;t mean to fall asleep. Sorry, Mr Stark.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;Are we stopping or didja just miss me?&rdquo; He taunts.</p><p>Tony plays with words in his mouth. Peter sounds okay, has enough in him to make fun&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d do a number on your neck if I let you sleep like that any longer. I&rsquo;m sure your aunt would have a thing or two to say about that. You alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your neck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not too bad.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Sure. And since we&rsquo;re playing make-believe, I&rsquo;m late for my date with the Tooth Fairy, so if you&rsquo;ll excuse me&hellip;</i></p><p>Peter pulls his hoodie off. He balls it up and hugs it to him, his socked feet up on the seat. Tony makes a cursory glance at him, and catches his eye. He smiles. Peter smiles back &ndash; his eyes are tired. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop in about half an hour. You can go back to sleep if you want, I&rsquo;m fine with the radio.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turns on the radio. &ldquo;Nah. I&rsquo;ve left you on your own &ndash; which, by the way, Ms Potts told me <i>never</i> to do &ndash; for like, half an hour already&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;and I know y&mdash;<i>two hours</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony snorts and nods. &ldquo;Aaa<i>yup</i>. Did an excellent corpse impression.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr <i>Stark</i>!&rdquo; Peter whines, cracking his window open and sticking his fingers out. &ldquo;You shoulda woke me up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, think you&rsquo;ll find I <i>did</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sooner!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m nothing if not a generous man.&rdquo; Peter doesn&rsquo;t rebut the statement, and Tony promptly files it away under <i>Jokes That Fall Flat Because The Kid Still Thinks I&rsquo;m a Good Person</i>. &ldquo;And I thought I&rsquo;d better leave you to your fever-&ldquo; he shoots him a wilting look, &ldquo;and all. But yeah, you know, it&rsquo;s chill. It&rsquo;s cool. Well, you&rsquo;re not chill or cool. Because of the fever. Hey, look at that! I made a funny.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter is glaring at him, but with no heat behind it. &ldquo;I get warm when I sleep, and I had this on.&rdquo; He gestures to the hoodie. Tony sighs.</p><p>&ldquo;If you say so, kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really, Mr Stark, I feel fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony relents. &ldquo;You wanna put one of your playlists on?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter grins. </p><hr /><p>They stop for food. Peter gets a grilled cheese and strawberry milkshake. Tony watches him with reserved concern whenever he&rsquo;s not looking. </p><p>The kid&rsquo;s still bubbly and happy and warm - still <i>warm</i> warm, too. Tony sneakily checked by messing up Peter&rsquo;s hair like he hates him doing &ndash; but he is a little quieter.</p><p>He definitely doesn&rsquo;t inhale his food like he normally does, or order seconds like he normally does, and when Tony orders <i>himself</i> seconds, he excuses himself to the bathroom.</p><p>Tony eats the onion rings first in the couple minutes he&rsquo;s gone. He has his suspicions that the strong smell wasn&rsquo;t agreeing with the kid.</p><p>And, as always, his jaw&rsquo;s bothering him. Neck, too. </p><p>Watching him eat with exaggerated care and obvious pain is driving Tony&rsquo;s blood pressure through the damn roof.</p><p>They&rsquo;re back on the road now, have been for about 4 hours. </p><p>Tony listens to the classical station on low volume, the local news on medium, the rock station on almost mute. He ends up shutting it all off.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t plan on stopping till 2 or 3am; however long it takes to get to their hotel checkpoint. It just makes sense to drive till late, when it&rsquo;s quiet, then sleep in to miss the early morning traffic, have a late breakfast and do the same again. </p><p>He&rsquo;ll stop if Peter asks, but otherwise, he&rsquo;s good. </p><p>The quiet &ndash; Peter&rsquo;s obviously out cold once again &ndash; is actually nice. It&rsquo;s not heavy and oppressive, like he can find quiet to be. It&rsquo;s just steady. He&rsquo;s thinking about things without feeling overwhelmed. He can just drive and think and think and drive.</p><p>And keep an eye on the kid. </p><p>He shifts in his sleep, head now pillowed against the window with Tony&rsquo;s jacket, and hoodie still bunched up in his arms, hugged to his waist.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only 9pm right now, and he&rsquo;s wondering whether to push it till 10:30 or maybe 11. Six hours is a long time to drive non-stop, but he&rsquo;s not really hungry from his huge lunch, and he doesn&rsquo;t need the bathroom. </p><p>It all depends on Peter. If he stays asleep, he guesses he could just keep driving. </p><p>He&rsquo;s only a couple minutes into that resolution when Peter does wake. </p><p>&ldquo;Evening.&rdquo; He says softly. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you feel?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes flutter shut again and he offers only a small smile. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t move. Tony&rsquo;s too smart to know it&rsquo;s not because the position is too comfortable to relinquish. </p><p>He knows it&rsquo;s because any movement will jar and pain him. </p><p>He&rsquo;d offer him painkillers, but the kid&rsquo;s already refused them twice today. God, what can he do? Maybe he should take him on a spa day or something.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Pete. I wasn&rsquo;t gonna stop for a little while, but we can if you need to.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter flaps a hand at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good. Maybe in, like, an hour?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods. &ldquo;Sure thing. Hey, I was thinking. D&rsquo;you think you&rsquo;ve got a bad case of whiplash or something? Because you&rsquo;re flipping around Queens all day and I haven&rsquo;t put all that much reinforcement in the neck of the suit.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter eyes him and what looks like relief floods his features. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? Gimme the suit when we&rsquo;re back. I&rsquo;ll work on that for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of <i>course.</i> You think I&rsquo;m gonna let you let me do all the work for you?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter breathes out a laugh that turns into a more forced exhale when he moves to sit up straight. He leans forward tentatively, head in his hands. Tony&rsquo;s jacket slips down from the window into his lap and he digs a hand into it.</p><p>Tony balks. He can&rsquo;t reach for him, the road around them is busy. &ldquo;Hey, hey, hey. Easy. What&rsquo;s wrong, buddy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;okay. Just got sorta dizzy.&rdquo; Peter says, not moving from his position. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You thought what?&rdquo; Tony pulls up into gravel of the shoulder as gently as possible. He undoes both his and Peter&rsquo;s seatbelts. </p><p>He hesitates over what to do now he has his hands free and settles on rubbing a hand up and down Peter&rsquo;s lower back. &ldquo;Stay like that if it helps, Peter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thought I might pass out.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony feels Peter&rsquo;s cheek with the back of his hand. It&rsquo;s clammy. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, Mr Stark. I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; He murmurs. &ldquo;Just a headache. Not your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Think I was asleep for too long?&rdquo; Tony doesn&rsquo;t fail to notice that Peter&rsquo;s voice is a little bit croaky. &ldquo;In one position.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s insides twist. That isn&rsquo;t right.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Just breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter breathes. Tony looks up the nearest hotel, motel, truck stop, anything, and finds a motel a couple miles down the road. Peter tries to argue against it, so Tony just lies and says he&rsquo;s tired too.</p><p>The guy at the desk is nice. He&rsquo;s a huge, broad guy, with an impressive dark beard that Tony compliments the second he enters the reception. </p><p>He apologises profusely that they only have one room free, and it&rsquo;s a king. Tony insists it&rsquo;s fine. He wouldn&rsquo;t care if it were a shack that was $1,000,000/h: as long as it was clean and Peter got to lie down, he couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p><p>Peter, poor kid, must have held a similar kind of ethics for the situation, since he only argued with Tony for 5 minutes about who got the bed (&ldquo;<i>But Mr Stark, you&rsquo;re driving. And paying. You&rsquo;re already stopping for me. I like sleeping on couches.</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Not a chance in absolute hell, kid. Here&rsquo;s your pyjamas.&rdquo;</i>) before he fell into it face first and dead to the world.</p><p>The motel wasn&rsquo;t bad. It wasn&rsquo;t anything like the place Tony had originally booked for tonight, but it wasn&rsquo;t grimy or falling apart at the seams either. </p><p>It has clean sheets, a hot shower, a decent coffee machine, and a separate light for the kitchenette that means Tony can keep the room dim but still get some work done at the table. </p><p>He sits back and stares at the papers. This wasn&rsquo;t how he&rsquo;d expected to spend his evening. To be fair to Pepper &ndash; and he rarely was &ndash; she&rsquo;d be ecstatic that he was finally getting down to some business.</p><p>But, if he was <i>totally</i> honest, he&rsquo;d been looking forward to a repeat of the journey here: he and Peter&rsquo;d had a fun time. Obviously, it wasn&rsquo;t Peter&rsquo;s fault. The kid probably already felt guilty for the fact that he&rsquo;d altered their plans &ndash; even if he couldn&rsquo;t help it. </p><p>He resolves to make<i> sure </i>Peter knew he wasn&rsquo;t mad at him when he was feeling better. He hopes that&rsquo;d be tomorrow morning, what with Peter&rsquo;s healing factor. He had to admit that although they didn&rsquo;t spend every waking moment together, he&rsquo;d never seen Peter sick. It made him more than a little uncomfortable.</p><p><i>Oh well</i>. He picks up his pen and sighs. <i>No time like the present.</i></p><hr /><p>He eventually goes to the couch and gets a few hours shuteye. He sleeps till 3:45am, which isn&rsquo;t too bad, all things considered. It&rsquo;s about the limit of what he can get right now, what with the nightmares and the insomnia. </p><p>And a distinct lack of Pepper by his side.</p><p>Heaving himself up, he flips on the small lamp by the couch. Peter&rsquo;s still out of it, but his face has less lines than before. </p><p>Tony smiles. The kid&rsquo;s face has definitely regained more colour. </p><p>He picks up discarded items of clothing as he heads for the coffeemaker, folding them and placing them back on top of Peter&rsquo;s bag. As he drops them down, he notices the kid&rsquo;s phone screen light up at him. It&rsquo;s on 12%, and Tony&rsquo;s has a pet peeve for low batteries. He plugs it in on the nightstand and flips it onto silent.</p><p>Sitting back at the table, he mulls over the situation. </p><p>For starters, he&rsquo;s never seen Peter willingly sleep so much. He must be feeling really crappy to have slept for&hellip; what? It&rsquo;s gotta be <i>well </i>over 12 hours now. </p><p>For what Tony liked to call &ldquo;seconders&rdquo; (to piss Rhodey off), he had to admit to his paranoid, panicking brain that &ldquo;willingly&rdquo; was the operative word when he&rsquo;d said he&rsquo;d never seen Peter sleep that much. He <i>had </i>seen Peter sleep that much.</p><p>It just&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t exactly&hellip; with his consent? </p><p>The handful of times he&rsquo;d been injured as Spider-Man, his healing factor had forced him to sort of&hellip; hibernate so it could focus on repairing his body. Tony hoped to god that it was what was happening here.</p><p>For nexters, although the seconders answered one question, it raised another: if it was his enhanced healing, why wasn&rsquo;t it patching up his neck?</p><p>He would&rsquo;ve gone for a home run with <i>for lasters</i>, but he&rsquo;d been sitting and staring at the kid for so long, and the kid had been dead still the entire time. Which, for Peter Parker, sleeptalker extraordinaire, was weird. <i>Weird.</i></p><p>Peter was an active sleeper, to say the least. He was almost as hyper in sleep as he was awake (which embarrassed him to no end). He was always talking, laughing &ndash; which was <i>super</i> creepy, can he just say for the record &ndash; tossing and turning and ending up at the other end of the bed, or even slipping off the couch if there wasn&rsquo;t someone there to nudge him back on. Kid could sleep through a hurricane if it weren&rsquo;t for his Spidey sense.</p><p>But now&hellip; now Peter&rsquo;s in the centre of the bed, the <i>hogger,</i> comforter wrapped tight around his neck, and silent. When Tony comes closer, he sees that the kid&rsquo;s sweating. </p><p>He groans under his breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; he says, only half-hoping he&rsquo;d wake until he feels the same warmth amidst Peter&rsquo;s curls. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stirs lethargically. He goes to turn his head towards Tony, eyes closed, but they squint further shut in pain when his neck protests. &ldquo;Hey, time s&rsquo;it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Late.&rdquo; Tony answers honestly, softly. </p><p>He feels awkward standing by the kid&rsquo;s bedside, but now he&rsquo;s up close, he&rsquo;s bordering dangerously on concern for Peter&rsquo;s wax-candle paleness and body temperature. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter is a terrible liar - <i>especially</i> when bleary from sleep. Tony knows this before he even speaks, from the convulsive swallow and the soft, surprised gasp of pain that follows it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, man, I&rsquo;m good. We leaving? I can just&mdash;&rdquo; he swallows again and <i>does this kid really think I&rsquo;m not seeing this?</i> and rubs at his neck, &ldquo;&mdash;can just grab a quick shower and I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p><p>He begins coordinating his limbs into movement. Tony holds him down by his shoulder, and Peter squeaks a protesting <i>hey!</i></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going anywhere. You&rsquo;re sick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am not!&rdquo; Peter croaks, eyes already starting to slip shut again. &ldquo;I jus&rsquo; woke up. Gimme a chance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh-<i>huh</i>.&rdquo; He turns towards the kitchen and fills a glass of water, making sure it&rsquo;s cool but not ice-cold.</p><p>Peter watches him with an adorable suspicion that Tony pretends not to notice, and one eye cracked open.</p><p>&ldquo;Drink.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete.&rdquo; He cuts in, although gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hair&rsquo;s width from asking Hagrid at reception for a thermometer.&rdquo; Peter smiles slightly at the reference. He accepts the glass. &ldquo;Good call, kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>Whilst he drinks, Tony turns away again and heads to the couch, where he flips open his duffel and unzips the back pocket. </p><p>He rummages around, humming an <i>ah-ha!</i> as he pulls out some painkillers and shakes the pot by his ear. He grimaces when he hears what could only be a couple pills rattling around inside.</p><p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be enough for him.</p><p>He went back to Peter, who was struggling back the water. &ldquo;Hey, kid.&rdquo; He takes the glass off him and sets it aside. Peter looks relieved. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have enough meds for a superkid right now. D&rsquo;you want me to run to the store,&rdquo;<i> which is probably 20 miles away,</i> &ldquo;and grab some? And you&rsquo;ve got to be honest with me here. Seriously. I know your neck&rsquo;s bothering you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, no, it&rsquo;s fine, Mr Stark, honestly! I&rsquo;m fine. Store&rsquo;s probably like thirty miles away anyway. I&rsquo;ve had worse. Just needs sleeping off.&rdquo; Peter rushes to reassure, his voice thin and wispy.</p><p>Tony hesitates. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He murmurs. &ldquo;You know, you look like shit, Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what all the girls say.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiles. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite believe that, somehow.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiles back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not all womanizers like you, Mr Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How very dare you. I&rsquo;ll tell Miss Potts that when I see her, shall I?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smirks. Long gone were the days when he was nervous of Pepper, and anxious to please - the days when Tony&rsquo;s joking threats like that were taken as gospel. </p><p>He inhales deeply, as though about to yawn, and Tony takes that as his cue to move away back to his makeshift office, when Peter yelps in shock. He shifts back around to see the kid with his mouth hanging half open, hands probing his jaw desperately.</p><p>He&rsquo;d have made a joke about the wind changing if he had a little less tact.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; He comes to sit on the bed, taking his hands calmly and moving them away. Peter barely allows his ministrations, his groan coming out more guttural and unsettling since his mouth was open. He rolls onto his back so Tony can see better. He winces when Tony&rsquo;s fingers brush against his face. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;m just taking a quick look. No surprises.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony takes his chin in his right hand as carefully as he can. Peter&rsquo;s mouth is almost shut, his teeth bared like they usually would be mid-yawn. They couldn&rsquo;t have been more than an inch apart, his mouth more a rectangle than an <i>O.</i></p><p>He was gasping at the back of his throat, eyes roaming over Tony in question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, easy. You&rsquo;ve probably just clenched it too hard in your sleep and it&rsquo;s locked. It&rsquo;s happened to me before.&rdquo; Peter tries to nod in Tony&rsquo;s hold. </p><p>Tony takes his hot face more firmly in his hands and runs his thumbs in circles along the highest point of his jaw bone, the bases of his palms just above the wrist cushioning his chin. &ldquo;Stop me if this hurts too much, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter makes a <i>nuh-uh</i> sound in response. Tony takes it as reassurance that what he&rsquo;s doing is actually helping. </p><p>&ldquo;Easy.&rdquo; He says again and again, his brow furrowed and face calculating as he searches Peter&rsquo;s face for any signs of new pain or discomfort. &ldquo;I know it hurts, but it&rsquo;s helping. Promise. I&rsquo;m a doctor.&rdquo; He jokes. Peter&rsquo;s eyes shine for a moment, then dull back into his <i>This Hurts But I&rsquo;m Not One to Complain</i> calibre of Brave Face.</p><p>Slowly, <i>slowly,</i> the pain implicit in the kid&rsquo;s features recedes, and his jaw eases back to being closed. Tony smoothes over the grooves of his bone structure in inspection. He isn&rsquo;t sure whether it was fully better or not.</p><p>&ldquo;You wanna try opening?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter twitches it from side to side like he&rsquo;s swishing mouthwash.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he tries, in a croak. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot better. Thanks, Mr Stark. Really. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiles softly. He hopes that the disquiet in his head wasn&rsquo;t showing on his face. <i>What the hell is wrong with this kid?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Jeez, that was actually kind of embarrassing.&rdquo; Peter says slowly, working his jaw out with each word. He rubs his cheek, which was blushing beneath his touch. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s some pretty good ammo to use against me, me sitting here like a fish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like a fish?&rdquo; Tony chuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, like a&mdash;&rdquo; Peter makes a stupid face, puffing his cheeks and lazily circling his lips. &ldquo;&mdash;a&mdash;a fish.&rdquo; </p><p>His eyes narrow in affection. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; He huffs a quick laugh out of his nose.</p><p>Peter was covering for how the pain he was feeling right now &ndash; he knows that &ndash; and Tony doesn&rsquo;t want to break the light atmosphere between them by pointing it out.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I mean, that hurt, but&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s feeling better now though.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&lsquo;Better&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt at all&rsquo;. </i>&ldquo;Anything else hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t reply. His forced swallow answers for him. Face a picture of exasperation, Tony&rsquo;s eyes widen as his eyebrows practically hit his hairline, head cocking to the side in an entirely too paternal show of anticipation of <i>the truth.</i></p><p>Peter reads his expression. He sighs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad. I&rsquo;ve had worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony purses his lips, eyes blinking slowly and chin retracting into his neck as he stares into space. Sarcasm laces his every movement. <i>Say that one more time, and I swear to god&hellip; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Hilarious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That you think that <i>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had worse&rsquo;</i> somehow placates me. At all. Ha ha. You&rsquo;re actually very amusing, Peter, has anyone ever told you that?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes slide shut, deflating. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only telling you the truth. Truth hurts sometimes.&rdquo; His voice held the quality of someone trying not to fall asleep in a second flat. When he speaks again, he&rsquo;s somehow mustered a sombre tone that provokes Tony into almost believing him. &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;m okay. Just my neck and my throat hurt. And my jaw. And just a little headache. But, it&rsquo;s like&mdash;localised? So it&rsquo;s okay. I took a hard hit round there on patrol, the other night. And the whiplash thing that you said. Think that. It&rsquo;s not that bad. Really, s&rsquo;all good.&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;Sure. And what about the fever?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I run hot, Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;ve got the flu, kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>He almost hits the roof in surprise when that doesn&rsquo;t make Peter &nbsp;immediately rise up in debate. &ldquo;Maybe. Be gone tomorrow. Sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No sorries. Only getting betters.&rdquo; Tony places a cool hand over Peter&rsquo;s jaw again, presses lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;okay.&rdquo;</p><p>With a sigh, he nods slowly. It&rsquo;s clear Peter has a high tolerance for pain, and a low tolerance for being worried about. If the kid said he was okay, he had to believe him and leave him, he guessed. </p><p>He makes Peter finish the water, even though it seems to really hurt his throat, and refills it. He puts it within arms reach and opens all the windows. </p><p>Then he gets one of the washcloths from the bathroom and soaks it through. He puts it on Peter&rsquo;s forehead and leaves it there. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me if it gets worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;f course, M&rsquo;st&rsquo;r Stark.&rdquo; Peter curls back onto his side, washcloth sliding down so it&rsquo;s propped up between his bangs and the quickly soaking pillow. Tony counts it as a win if it&rsquo;s still touching his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, kid.&rdquo; He pats Peter&rsquo;s leg &ndash; who he was sure had already passed right out - and goes back to his sketchpads and plans.</p><p>He&rsquo;s shifted some papers aside and is just opening his laptop to try Googling the kid&rsquo;s symptoms for some semblance of understanding &ndash; of what the hell might be going on, of how to help the kid (<i>of why his super healing hadn&rsquo;t kicked in to fix a simple knock to the larynx, and then he gets the flu, for god&rsquo;s sake, it&rsquo;s stressing me out</i>) when a quiet but indignant, croaking question rises up from the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be sleeping? It&rsquo;s <i>late</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony snorts. &ldquo;Too many questions from an inquisitive Spiderling for one day. Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I asked <i>one</i> question.&rdquo; Peter mumbles into his pillow. </p><p>Tony tastes the <i>I&rsquo;m fine</i> on his tongue and almost laughs at his hypocrisy. He sighs, shutting his laptop. &ldquo;Finding the concept of sleep a little difficult to grasp at present, if you must know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you tried list&rsquo;ning to&hellip; like&hellip; rain?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony smirks at the &gt;90% unconscious teen on the bed. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>He watches the kid, who, with his eyes closed, runs his fingers along the charger till they meet his phone, fumbles a couple times to unlock it, and swipes to a white noise app. &ldquo;S&rsquo;&hellip;good. Helps me sleep, y&rsquo;know?&rdquo; </p><p>Heavy rain and the gush of ocean surf fill the room. Peter tucks his phone beneath his pillow, giving the sound a round, enclosed property that makes it all the more calming. </p><p><i>It helps him block everything else out. </i></p><p><i>Everything&rsquo;s dialled to 11. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;should sleep, you know, Mis&rsquo;r Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Pete. Fine. I&rsquo;m gonna.&rdquo;</p><p>He mostly lies down on the couch to appease the kid.</p><p>He mostly falls <i>asleep</i> because of the rainy lull that envelopes the room and the echo of <i>it&rsquo;s not that bad</i> that&rsquo;s running around his head.</p><p>He wakes to Peter calling his name.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark? I&mdash; <i>ah</i>&mdash;&rdquo; A gasp.</p><p>He pauses for a split second, checking to make sure he didn&rsquo;t imagine it, then sits bolt upright. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark,&rdquo; he sounds breathless. Tony reaches for the lamp. </p><p>Illumination billows into the room like smoke and he feels his pupils constrict. His eyes go straight to the kid sitting on the floor, knees drawn up. &ldquo;<i>Peter?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Well, whaddya know?<i> It </i>is<i> that bad.</i></p><p>He crouches before him and wraps a hand around a trembling bicep. That arm is cradling his stomach.</p><p>The other is held awkwardly aloft &ndash; it&rsquo;s bent so that his elbow is pointing to the ceiling. His face is pressed into the crook of it, and his hand pushes into his neck like he&rsquo;s desperately trying to alleviate pressure, clawing at it like he&rsquo;s in agony.</p><p>His face is scrunched up, and he&rsquo;s breathing harsh and heavy.</p><p>Tony pushes a hand up onto his cheek. &ldquo;Hey. Talk to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter just gasps. </p><p>&ldquo;Pete? You&rsquo;re scaring me here, kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip; move. I can&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; Is forced out through ground teeth.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s stomach pits. <i>What is this?</i></p><p>Some kind of parasite? Is he going through <i>paralysis? </i></p><p><i>Oh, god. He hoped not.</i></p><p>He schools his features and grabs<i> Initiative</i> firmly by the throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Alright, Peter, where does it hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chokes on his breath. &ldquo;<i>Everywhere</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods, shifts the leg that held his weight. &ldquo;Yeah, I figured. Okay, bud, I&rsquo;m going to move you real slow, okay? I need you lying down, because I&rsquo;m very conscious of you passing out right about now. I&rsquo;ll do the work, okay? Don&rsquo;t fight me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; </p><p>It was like untangling a fierce knot. Tony knew he couldn&rsquo;t help it. Peter&rsquo;s super-strength fights against every small touch, and he&rsquo;s very close to crying - and not stopping. Tony could sense it in his breathing, in his face, in his jarred swallowing. He could literally sense it like a balmy air threatening rain. It was the worst feeling.</p><p>He starts by straightening one of his legs, wanting to put off moving his arms for as long as possible. Now with room in front of him, Peter slowly leans forward to be against Tony. Tony swallows hard and rubs his back. </p><p><i>Do I move him or not? God, do I </i>move him or not?!</p><p>Peter decides for him.</p><p>&ldquo;I can stand.&rdquo; He grinds out. Tony doesn&rsquo;t argue with him. His hands hover over his back as he heaves himself up and sits back on the bed. </p><p>Once he&rsquo;s down, and his arms are no longer raised, Tony crouches by his head. He squints at him till they have eye contact. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t look good, Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gives him the saddest of small smiles. Tears are pricking at his tear ducts, and the smile drops. He looks like a little kid. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening to me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know. But we&rsquo;ll figure it out.&rdquo; </p><p>Up close, Peter smells of sweat and the same floral detergent that their entire apartment smells like. Tony thinks of May, and what she&rsquo;d do. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s trembling. He&rsquo;s paler than a sheet and his voice is little more than a crackle. He&rsquo;s burning up, and Tony knows that everything above his shoulders is pure agony. </p><p>Something flashes through his mind, a possible diagnosis that rings a bell when the words<i> lockjaw</i> and <i>stiff neck</i> and <i>fever</i> go together, but he shakes his head. Peter&rsquo;s been vaccinated. May <i>is</i> not,<i> was</i> not, never was and never will be, an anti-vaxxer. He knows that for certain. </p><p><i>But it looks so much like&hellip;</i></p><p>Peter groans, eyes glassy. He shuts them and Tony tangles his fingers in his hair and massages his scalp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, bud.&rdquo;</p><p>He knows what he has to do. </p><p>Happy picks up on the 11th ring. His disgruntled nature is thrown off when Tony tells him he needs a private jet or chopper or something as soon as possible, as close as possible to his current location. He texts him his co-ordinates and waits for a text back with his ETA.</p><p>3 hours. And he&rsquo;s bringing Bruce.</p><p>3 hours till medical attention. Around 6 hours till they&rsquo;re back at the compound. He looks at Peter desperately. He&rsquo;s tingling all over with adrenaline and fear. He could literally see the kid going downhill.</p><p>The nearest hospital&rsquo;s much farther than 3 fucking hours. He&rsquo;d made FRIDAY look into getting something directly to the hospital &ndash; a medical chopper, or something, he didn&rsquo;t know. Turned out to be 5 hour round trip so he sticks with Bruce and Happy, and a jet with a full medsuite available.</p><p>So they&rsquo;re stranded till then. </p><p>Things just always seemed to work out that way, didn&rsquo;t they?</p><p>He sits on the bed beside Peter and holds his hand. Peter squeezes it in what Tony can&rsquo;t decide is a coping mechanism for the pain, or meant to calm him down until he numbly realises it&rsquo;s probably both.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter? I need you to hold on, okay? I&rsquo;m getting you help. I think&hellip; well, I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;m really sorry. But you&rsquo;re gonna be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Peter gasps. He&rsquo;s speaking slowly, from the pain in his jaw, and Tony can&rsquo;t help but let the scary diagnosis word hurl itself against the padded walls of his Crazy House mind over and over.</p><p>It&rsquo;s quiet.</p><p>They both have their self-prescribed tasks: Tony rubs his thumb over Peter&rsquo;s knuckles and watches his phone like a hawk. Peter tries to suck it up and swallows back groans and whimpers like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. He doesn&rsquo;t sleep.</p><p>Well. </p><p>It <i>is</i> quiet, till Peter speaks.</p><p>He speaks calmly. Matter-of-factly.</p><p>&ldquo;My stomach hurts.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony straightens, all unsure and nervous. &ldquo;Okay. Alright. Can I&mdash;can I take a look?&rdquo; </p><p>He raises his pyjama top and rubs his hands together till they&rsquo;re warm. Peter still sucks in a breath when they make contact.</p><p>He gently &ndash; god, he could not be more gentle if he tried, and it&rsquo;s still hurting him, <i>he&rsquo;s</i> still hurting him &ndash; palpates his stomach, and both of them gasp at the same time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard as rock. </p><p>He looks at Peter, fear and definite realisation dawning on him. His heart sinks, thudding in fear for the kid. </p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Peter rasps. Now his hand&rsquo;s free from Tony&rsquo;s hold, it joins his other limbs in sliding sluggishly against the comforter in pain and discomfort as he rides out another wave of flashing cramps. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony shakes his head and lowers his shirt. He takes back Peter&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Nothing. You&rsquo;re okay. It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; He says fruitlessly. He feels so stupid. He doesn&rsquo;t know what to do!</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turns and palms Peter&rsquo;s face, hoping Peter&rsquo;s going to ask him to do something for him, to give him <i>something</i> to do to help. &ldquo;Kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna throw up.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s sitting up and heaving and crying before Tony can grab the trash can, and suddenly he has a sobbing kid covered in vomit and their only bed faring not much better. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s <i>really</i> crying now. He&rsquo;s holding his stomach and bent over it as much as his neck will allow. </p><p>Tony shakes his head. &ldquo;Not your fault, Underoos. Not at all. Don&rsquo;t you worry about it. My job.&rdquo; He reassures, as warmly as he can. &ldquo;You got more?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter says no. He laughs once. Tony isn&rsquo;t sure why he laughs, but it&rsquo;s completely devoid of humour anyway and then rapidly followed by a breathy groan when his jaw disagrees with the action. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe talking isn&rsquo;t a good idea right now, huh, buddy?&rdquo; Tony suggests, not unkindly. &ldquo;I would tell you to nod, but uh&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Peter settles for the thumbs up/down approach.</p><p>Tony helps him shift so his back&rsquo;s against the headboard, wedging a pillow between his neck and shoulders so he feels as little pain as possible. </p><p>He strips the comforter from beneath him &ndash; it hasn&rsquo;t soaked through, thankfully &nbsp;- and throws it into the corner. He replaces it with his blanket from the couch. </p><p>Then he finds the washcloth and fills up a bowl of warm water. He cleans up Peter&rsquo;s face, wiping at the sick and tears and sweat with no sarcastic comment, only soft reassurances.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s expression is a mixture of mortified and miserable. He&rsquo;s still shaking, and once Tony&rsquo;s eased off his shirt &ndash; something that makes Peter cry out despite his best efforts not to &ndash; he replaces it with one of his own sleep shirts and Peter&rsquo;s hoodie. </p><p>The pants are a different matter. Peter&rsquo;s eyes are closed, and he&rsquo;s breathing deeply like Tony&rsquo;s told him to. He can&rsquo;t leave the kid in them, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to undress him when changing his shirt was the <i>Worst Moment of his Life So Far,</i> according to the kid&rsquo;s expression. </p><p>He&rsquo;s giving him a breather from the movement when he notices Peter&rsquo;s jaw is locked again, and it&rsquo;s stuck in this sinister sort-of grin that Tony can hardly look at. He does the massaging like he did before until Peter&rsquo;s mouth is shut. As it closes, he groans loudly and it dissolves into a grimaced set of sobs. </p><p>His eyes are squeezed shut and he knows the kid wants nothing more than to arch his back and neck like he does when he&rsquo;s hurting, but he can&rsquo;t. It damn near breaks Tony&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>He waits for him to open his eyes again, but he doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Um. Pete?&rdquo; Peter opens his eyes slowly. &ldquo;Hi. Only me. Uh&hellip; hate to say this, but we&rsquo;re gonna have to change your pants, kiddo.&rdquo; He groans. &ldquo;&mdash;I know, I know, Pete. I&rsquo;m sorry. But I can&rsquo;t let you sit in it. Your aunt would kill me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter uses the hand that isn&rsquo;t clutching his stomach to give a shaky and reluctant thumbs-up.</p><p>He finds a fresh pair of underwear and a pair of sweats in Peter&rsquo;s bag and brings them over. Peter swallows forcefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Aaaalrighty. How d&rsquo;you wanna do this?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter edges to the edge of the bed, Tony catching on quickly. He wavers, but does manage stay up of his own steam. Tony knows it&rsquo;s agony for him. &ldquo;Shut your eyes.&rdquo; He croaks from behind his teeth. </p><p>Tony rolls them, instead. He has one grounding hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Peter, it&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;ve never seen before.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Shut.&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t know whether that meant <i>shut up</i> or <i>shut your eyes so help me god</i>, but he decides he may as well do both. He&rsquo;s desperate for Peter to lay down again and though it may not seem like it with some of the pranks he pulls on the kid sometimes, he does give at least <i>half</i> a damn about his dignity. He still has his hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, he figures, so it can&rsquo;t go too badly wrong.</p><p>Well.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;s S&rsquo;ark.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony opens his eyes. Peter&rsquo;s in his new boxers, but the sweats are on the carpet. He&rsquo;s looking decidedly <i>worse</i> than ever, and Tony has to stoop and wrap his arms round him for fear of him fainting.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s drooling. Tony idly hopes it&rsquo;s from the lack of movement in his jaw and not because he&rsquo;s about to toss his cookies again. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; look.&rdquo; He whispers.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. &ldquo;Not looking.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter whines softly into his shoulder. &ldquo;It hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony hushes him, at a complete loss of what to do or say or be. It&rsquo;s hurting him, too. &ldquo;What can I do, Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stay.&rdquo;</p><p>His stomach pitches in affection and raw concern. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere, buddy. I&rsquo;ve invested too much money in you, you know that.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t laugh. In fact, he doesn&rsquo;t react at all. His breathing&rsquo;s calmed, he&rsquo;s leaning all the more heavier into Tony, and it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to knows he&rsquo;s passed out. </p><p>So he panics.</p><p>He panics, laying him back down and checking his pulse on his neck - &nbsp;and then his wrist for good measure. It&rsquo;s there, strong and maybe a little fast, but it&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s okay. </p><p>He&rsquo;s still breathing. He double checks that, too, and allows himself to relax. He&rsquo;s passed out from exertion. From pain, maybe, though he doubts it. Peter&rsquo;s taken a hell of a lot of pain before and been okay. This is a whole new level. </p><p>Something different.</p><p>Tetanus.</p><p>He&rsquo;s pretty sure. </p><p>He graciously as possible pulls Peter&rsquo;s sweats on and some socks after it. It feels a little too much like dressing a dead body for his liking, but he&rsquo;s checked Peter&rsquo;s breathing about five times now, and he is. </p><p>He texts Happy to go<i> faster</i> and brings his computer over. He looks up tetanus and frowns. </p><p>He spares the sleeping teen a look. &ldquo;You had to go whole-hog, didn&rsquo;t you. Couldn&rsquo;t get a head cold like everyone else.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate&hellip; &nbsp;</i></p><p>His fingers rest on Peter&rsquo;s jumpy pulse point as he reads.</p><p><i>Facial spasms. Difficulty swallowing. Abdominal tenseness.</i></p><p><i>&hellip; can be fatal if not treated quickly.</i></p><p>&ldquo;<i>O</i>-kay. Yep. Uh-huh. That&rsquo;s enough of the scary stories.&rdquo; He slams the laptop shut and sits waiting for the silence to reply to him.</p><p>He checks his watch. Another hour and a half.</p><p>He wipes Peter&rsquo;s brow, makes sure the hoodie isn&rsquo;t too thick.</p><p>Paces a little, moves the trash can closer to the bed, carries on pacing. </p><p>All but runs to <i>actually</i> ask Hagrid for a thermometer. He doesn&rsquo;t have one, so he just grabs some ice from the machine and puts the bucket in the bathtub just in case. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll know when to use it but he feels better knowing it&rsquo;s there.</p><p>He paces again. Then he stands by the door and holds it open, looking for headlights. Then he paces again. </p><p>He stands with his hands in his pockets and stares at the kid, who&rsquo;s now stirred enough to reassure him he&rsquo;s not out cold anymore; though still not getting any kind of <i>peaceful</i> sleep. Bodily sighing, his swipes his foot over the carpet. The fibres flip over and he makes an infinity symbol pattern over and over with the midsole of his shoe. He&rsquo;s pleased that it took up 2 whole minutes &ndash; only 51 to go.</p><p>He wonders if he should wake him and make him drink some water.</p><p>He packs both their things up and puts the bags by the door. He paces just a little more because his feet are buzzing from inactivity.</p><p>He decides he <i>should</i> wake the kid. He decides against it. He decides against the deciding against it. He makes some coffee and doesn&rsquo;t drink any of it. </p><p>He wishes, and wishes, and wishes again he hadn&rsquo;t taken the kid on this trip.</p><p>He hopes to god he&rsquo;ll be okay.</p><p>Peter lets out a hushed, crackly, <i>heartbreaking </i>whine from the back of his throat. Tony re-wets the washcloth and moves the trash can a little closer. He sits and cups his cheek. It feels like a placebo method of willing his temperature down, but he&rsquo;ll take anything over feeling completely useless.</p><p>When his phone starts to ring with 32 minutes left, he almost jumps out of his skin. He drops Peter&rsquo;s hand and moves to the kitchenette to answer. &ldquo;Gimme good news, Hogan.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Driving to you now. How&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Thank God. He&rsquo;s asleep. How long till you&rsquo;re here? Bruce there? Tell him it&rsquo;s tetanus. I mean&mdash;I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s tetanus now. Though I&rsquo;m open alternative diagnoses. My pride can take the hit.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Jesus, Tony&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Navigation thing says 12 minutes. See you in 8. Yes, Bruce is here.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Holding you to 8. Drive safe. Drive fast.&rdquo;</p><p>7 minutes later, a dishevelled Bruce is jumping out of a blue Audi, dragging his medcase with him. Tony waves, and he jogs over. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Tony.&rdquo; He says. Tony doesn&rsquo;t know how Bruce manages to sound apologetic in everything he says, but he can and does.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much for coming.&rdquo; He ushers him in and Bruce heads straight for the bed. He gasps when he feels Peter&rsquo;s forehead, and he looks at Tony, an appalled look on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Please. Help him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Okay. Tell me what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony regales the entire story to Bruce as he inflates a blood pressure cuff and waits for his temperature to take. He doesn&rsquo;t look impressed when the readings come through onto a device he&rsquo;s holding.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it? Tetanus? Or not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, tetanus or <i>not</i>, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s taking advantage of his enhanced state. I&rsquo;ve never seen something this serious advance so fast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what does that mean? Is he gonna recover quicker? Is he dying?&rdquo; Tony babbles. Bruce just shakes his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Not necessarily.&rdquo; Tony doesn&rsquo;t have the gall to ask which question he&rsquo;s answering. &ldquo;But I think you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m gonna give him the tetanus antitoxin and set up an IV now. He needs to be back on the jet.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t look away when the huge needle pierces his arm, or when the IV goes into his hand. He stands there, helpless and hapless and a complete fucking idiot who&rsquo;s going to let his kid die because he couldn&rsquo;t recognise tetanus if it slapped him in the face.</p><p>He <i>feels</i> like he&rsquo;s been slapped in the face.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you carry him?&rdquo; Bruce is looking at him like he&rsquo;s said this question already. Tony nods, gormless. Bruce nods back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given him a short-acting barbiturate sedation to keep him out till the jet at least. This is going to hurt his neck, so be gentle, Tony, be gentle.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony is gentle. He hugs the kid to him for the entire tense car ride &ndash; Happy breaking the speed limit what feels like twice over, Bruce taking readings and feeling Peter&rsquo;s neck and jaw and stomach whilst holding an IV up in the air.</p><p>He thought he&rsquo;d have been able to breathe a sigh of relief when he got Peter onto the medbay bed, but he just&hellip; can&rsquo;t.</p><p>Can&rsquo;t breathe. </p><p>He watches wires and nurses swamp his kid from his freakout corner. They take his blood to look for anything else &ndash; though Bruce is almost adamant it&rsquo;s tetanus by now, and he&rsquo;s injecting Peter with needle after needle of antibiotics. They get to work on his jaw and neck, doing stuff that Tony has no idea how to explain.</p><p>They cut through his hoodie and place cooling gel packs on him. Tony shifts on his feet, because Peter really liked that old hoodie, and he knows his guilt will force him to trawl <i>eBay</i> for another lookalike till he finds another one for the poor kid.</p><p>It won&rsquo;t be the same. The lettering won&rsquo;t be faded and the drawstring won&rsquo;t be missing and it won&rsquo;t smell like the rest of May&rsquo;s laundry&mdash;</p><p>May.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s got to call the kid&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo; He murmurs to nobody in particular. He slips out of the room.</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t answer. Again, he&rsquo;s surprised to not be relieved at all. The <i>leave a message after the beep</i> beep beeps and he stares at the wall. </p><p>&ldquo;May. It&rsquo;s me. I&rsquo;d really appreciate it if you could give me a call back as soon as you can. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>His screen lights up with her name a second later. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;May.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Tony, what&rsquo;s happened? Are you okay? Is Peter?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Are you sitting down?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scaring me. Tell me right now.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He gulps. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s not okay. He&rsquo;s sick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sick? <i>Oh, my god. What&rsquo;s wrong with him? Can I speak to him?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; well, we&rsquo;re not 100% yet. Tests are coming back in soon. But we think&hellip; May, we think it&rsquo;s tetanus.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Tetanus? Oh, my god. My poor baby. Tetanus? Tony, it can&rsquo;t be tetanus. I got him immunised. I&mdash;I made sure he got all his boosters! He hasn&rsquo;t been bit by any feral animals or&mdash;how do you even get it? What&rsquo;s happening to him? Where are you? I need to see my baby.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I believe you got him vaccinated. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be through an animal bite. I don&rsquo;t really know how else, I only Googled it for a second. Dirt? I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;The mud run&hellip;&rdquo;</i> May breathes. Tony straightens. She&rsquo;s right.</p><p>Peter ran a charity mud run <i>twice</i> a few days ago. Once as Peter Parker, once as Spider-Man. The kid only needed one small cut, or to have accidentally ingested some of the dirt, and it&rsquo;d be straight to Tetanus Town. Especially with a healing factor like his &ndash; anything that got into a cut Peter had would be sealed in within the hour. </p><p>&ldquo;God, I think you&rsquo;re right. FRIDAY, let Bruce know.&rdquo; He sits down on the edge of a plush seat. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s asleep right now. So I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s in any pain, at least.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in a lot of pain?&rdquo;</i> May asks quietly.</p><p>Tony steadies his hand by shoving it between his knees. &ldquo;Yeah. I didn&rsquo;t realise soon enough what was going on. It&rsquo;s my fault. His neck was hurting, and his jaw seized up at one point. He threw up on himself, and I&hellip; he had a dizzy spell, for god&rsquo;s sake, and I didn&rsquo;t <i>realise.</i>&rdquo; He only just holds back from saying <i>and now it might be too late.</i></p><p>May is silent. <i>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;On a jet back to the compound. I can send a car to pick you up when we&rsquo;re an hour out.&rdquo; He says. He can sense her anger at him, and he actually wants to see her so he can be chewed out.</p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I can drive myself.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, May.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I doubt I&rsquo;m going to be getting any more <i>in loco parentis</i> opportunities anytime soon.&rdquo; He can&rsquo;t quite keep the self-reproach out of his deadpan tone.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Tony. I know my nephew. I know what he&rsquo;s like. I know you look after him. You&rsquo;re on a private jet, are you not? I&rsquo;m assuming you cleaned up vomit from him, did you not? Tony, this wasn&rsquo;t your fault. Trust me. I&rsquo;m not angry. I&rsquo;m just scared. I&rsquo;m&hellip; really in the dark here.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know when Bruce knows more. That&rsquo;s a promise.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay. If he wakes up, tell him I love him and I&rsquo;ll be waiting for him when you land, okay?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart twists. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>He hasn&rsquo;t even hung up before Happy comes in, foregoing knocking. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming round.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Peter comes round all at once. He shouts out in agony, and Bruce leaps to dole out the analgesia. Tony cups his cheek instantly, blocking his eyes from roaming around the darkened room. &ldquo;Hey. Look at me, kiddo. It&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;re alright. Bruce is gonna help you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s lip is trembling. A tear&rsquo;s path gets cut off by Tony&rsquo;s hand, and he uses his middle finger to wipe them away. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here, okay? Where you can see me.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce nods at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, listen, Pete. We don&rsquo;t know how yet, but you&rsquo;ve contracted tetanus. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of it in biology class. It&rsquo;s not fun, and I&rsquo;m really so sorry it&rsquo;s happened like this. But I <i>promise</i> you we&rsquo;re gonna get you better.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce stands behind Peter&rsquo;s head, shaking a vial of something. He pauses when Tony doesn&rsquo;t continue and meets his eyes. <i>Tell him what I told you.</i></p><p>Tony looks down sadly. Peter&rsquo;s eyes are wide and bright from the tears and pain, watching him steadily.</p><p>&ldquo;I do promise you we&rsquo;ll fix this. But I also&hellip; I can&rsquo;t lie to you. It&rsquo;s not gonna be easy, Pete. You got the facial spasms, right? And your stomach hurt?&rdquo; He placed a gentle hand on Peter&rsquo;s stomach and rubbed as gently as possible. Peter&rsquo;s eyes fluttered shut. &ldquo;Well, now your jaw&rsquo;s locked into place. And it&rsquo;ll keep advancing till you&rsquo;re having these sort-of&hellip; god, Peter I&rsquo;m so sorry. You&rsquo;re gonna have these&hellip; Bruce?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Peter.&rdquo; Bruce moves into the frame of Peter&rsquo;s eyeline. &ldquo;What Tony&rsquo;s trying to say is that your muscles are going to go into spasm all over your body. It&rsquo;ll be like having a seizure. I&rsquo;m giving you as much pain relief as I can. It&rsquo;s&hellip; really not fun. Sorry, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony takes his hand. &ldquo;Peter, how bad is the pain out of ten? Squeeze.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squeezes ten times.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart breaks into another million pieces with each weak clasp.</p><p>Bruce stares at him, waiting for a number. </p><p>&ldquo;Ten.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aw, I&rsquo;m sorry Peter.&rdquo; </p><p>It&rsquo;s somehow horrible to not hear Peter say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it!&rdquo; </p><p>If he&rsquo;s honest, it&rsquo;s horrible not to hear anything at all. The balance is all off. He&rsquo;s never craved one of Peter&rsquo;s nerdy, trip-over-your-words rants more than right now.</p><p>Bruce ups the morphine dosage a little higher and goes about prepping the most effective diazepam formula for Peter&rsquo;s oncoming seizures. Tony carries on trying to calm him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. And I talked to your aunt.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s eyes fly open at that &ndash; Tony can see in them that if he could have, he&rsquo;d have asked about May. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be there when we land. She told me to say &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;. Not me. Her. I don&rsquo;t love you. You know I&rsquo;ve always found you to be a chronic menace.&rdquo; Tony huffs a tired laugh and runs his hand through Peter&rsquo;s hair, leaving it there as a comforting gesture. Peter eyelids slide shut again.</p><p>The next three hours go about as smoothly as Tony had expected. </p><p>Peter graduates from a nasal cannula to a loud, invasive oxygen mask that he very clearly doesn&rsquo;t like. The second it&rsquo;s on, his hands are balling up and he&rsquo;s crying. One of them eventually fumbles for Tony&rsquo;s.</p><p>He ends up knowing every line and hair on them intimately, as it stays firmly grasped in his for the rest of the flight. If he loosens his grip, Peter&rsquo;s fingers flounder and the guilt swallows him whole.</p><p>The diazepam works well to slow down the body tremors for a while, but they really set off just as they&rsquo;re banking to land. </p><p>It&rsquo;s horrific. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes are open, darting around and terrified. His entire body seizes at once, his torso, arms and legs aggressively jerking inwards every second or so. It looks like some kind of demonic possession in a horror movie, and Tony wants nothing more than to look away. To just let it pass. He&rsquo;s <i>never </i>wanted something to end so much in his entire life. And he&rsquo;s been captured and tortured by terrorists. </p><p>But he&rsquo;s seen awful things before, and he likes to think he can handle anything like a mature adult. He&rsquo;s a superhero, for god&rsquo;s sake. He can do this.</p><p>Especially for Peter.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s strong. He&rsquo;s stronger than Tony could ever be. </p><p>But&hellip; he&rsquo;s still a kid. And he&rsquo;s terrified, and he&rsquo;s in agony.</p><p>So he whispers to the kid, whether he can hear him or not, strokes his cheek, hums to him, cards his hand through his sweaty hair. </p><p>Bruce squeezes his shoulder as he rushes past. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, Tony. Keep doing that, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>He cannot imagine the pain Peter&rsquo;s in. He asks for him to be sedated, but Bruce sadly explains that with Peter&rsquo;s enhanced state, they need him awake. They don&rsquo;t know how fast this thing is gonna progress, and they need to monitor his alertness.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re landing now, buddy. Not too long. Get you down to the compound and get you fixed right up. Be back to doing backflips off the Empire State and scaring the hell out of me in no time.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squeezes his hand hard in between jolts. &ldquo;I know, Pete. I know.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>May goes almost&hellip; <i>green</i> when she sees Peter. They&rsquo;re pushing him on the stretcher into the med bay, which she&rsquo;s sat outside of, ripping up an old receipt into little pieces that fall into her purse.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s whole body is jolting again and again and again like he&rsquo;s being electrocuted and there are wires going everywhere, and the big scary oxygen mask dwarfs his face. He&rsquo;s making a broken keening sound in the back of his throat, which heightens when Tony reluctantly lets go of his hand to give the team room to work around him. They disappear through the medbay doors, one of them requesting they give them some time to stabilise him.</p><p>May is frozen, standing there with her purse on the ground. Pieces of receipt are scattered everywhere.</p><p>Her head turns and she stares at him with big eyes. </p><p>She looks worn ragged with worry. </p><p>Tony guesses he doesn&rsquo;t look much different.</p><p>&ldquo;He just started going downhill&hellip;&rdquo; he supplies uselessly. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to happen to him?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony just looks back at her. May is the kind of woman whose entire composure begs you not to fuck with her. Or lie to her.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Hopefully get better.&rdquo; He feels the last word come out as an empty laugh, and he drops down into one of the chairs, head in hands. His neck twinges, and he automatically imagines how Peter&rsquo;s must feel. &ldquo;Sorry, May. Just gimme a sec.&rdquo;</p><p>He feels the seat next to him dip down. &ldquo;If anyone can get through this, it&rsquo;s him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He shouldn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But he is. And there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to reverse that.&rdquo; May says sternly. Then her voice softens. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault, Tony. And you know if he could, he&rsquo;d tell you that. He&rsquo;d hate to think you were upset over him. You know what he&rsquo;s like, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony tilts his head to look up at her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult not to feel accountable. That&rsquo;s just who I am.&rdquo; He shrugs and claps his hands together.</p><p>May&rsquo;s expression is empathetic and warm. It&rsquo;s never been more clear to him where Peter gets it from. </p><p>&ldquo;You look like you could use a shower and one hell of a coffee IV. Go. Your FRIDAY voice thing can tell you if we&rsquo;re allowed in to see him, right?&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods. Although it was a suggestion, he can&rsquo;t help but feel that May has ordered it. &ldquo;Yeah. Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>He stands to leave, but so does May. She puts a hand on his shoulder. He turns, surprised. </p><p>She kisses his cheek. &ldquo;Thank you. For looking after him. He&rsquo;d be lost without you.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes fill a little &ndash; his eyes flit up and down her face and he swallows. She nods at him, squeezes his shoulder and heads towards the coffee machine. He watches her go and marvels at how amazing women are. </p><p>He holds that thought the whole time he showers, as he shaves and as he gets dressed. </p><p>The sentiment grows and blooms in his chest, warm, as Pepper comes in and straightens the wrinkles from his t-shirt. She evaluates his face, hands either side of it, and presses a soft kiss to his lips. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate that question with a fiery burning passion.&rdquo; He kisses her again and they wrap around each other. </p><p>Pepper gives him a look and goes to sit with May when they&rsquo;re leaving his room to find Steve, Nat, Clint and Wanda waiting in the living area for news. They all look expectantly up as he enters, and Tony tenses up till he reads the sympathy in their stances.</p><p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s sent me 4 texts about him.&rdquo; Steve huffs a laugh. Tony smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be ecstatic to hear that.&rdquo; Tony knows Peter thinks Sam Wilson is about the coolest guy on the planet. He&rsquo;s pretty sure the feeling is mutual, especially ever since Sam found out that Peter had chosen to write an essay on him, specifically on his work as a PTSD counsellor. </p><p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo; Wanda asks.</p><p>Tony sighs. Their faces fall. &ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s not good right now. Bruce says it is tetanus, and he&rsquo;s given him the antitoxin, and the antibiotics, and the anticonvulsants&hellip; he&rsquo;s had about every anti under the sun at this point, but&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;His enhanced healing isn&rsquo;t working?&rdquo; Nat asks.</p><p>Tony shakes his head, holding up his hand to lazily point at her in agreement. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen the kid get so much as a runny nose before, let alone tetanus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jeez. Tetanus. It&rsquo;s rough.&rdquo; Clint mutters, looking angry. Clint&rsquo;s the kinda guy to issue a death threat against tetanus itself. Tony wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he succeeded, either.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything we can do?&rdquo; Steve asks tentatively.</p><p>&ldquo;Hell if I know what <i>I</i> can do, Rogers.&rdquo; Tony murmurs. &ldquo;Just&hellip; <i>when</i> he gets better,&rdquo; they all nod enthusiastically at his wishful wording, &ldquo;come visit him? Kid loves hanging out with you losers, for some reason.&rdquo; He smiles at them, knowing that exhaustion and anxiety are blatant on his face. </p><p>They all smile softly and nod, agreeing unequivocally. Tony jerks his head back at them. &ldquo;Thanks, folks. Does, uh, anyone else want coffee? I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boss, Dr Banner&rsquo;s about to speak to May Parker.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Scratch that. Make your own coffee, I guess, you lazy schmucks.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony Stark doesn&rsquo;t run anywhere unless there&rsquo;s a fire behind him or a single-malt scotch ahead of him, but he can&rsquo;t really in good faith deny that he didn&rsquo;t jog down to medical.</p><p>Bruce is waiting for him, May no longer there. </p><p>Bruce always looks tired so he has to take a second to digest the dark bags under the man&rsquo;s eyes as he approaches him. &ldquo;Hi, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony puts his hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you wanna sit?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce hesitates. He says, &ldquo;Yeah. I could sit.&rdquo; like Tony&rsquo;s offering to take him for dinner.</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me straight, doc.&rdquo; </p><p>He squeezes his palms together till his fingers go white waiting for the bad news. The room seems to go silent as the world-ending fear he&rsquo;s been fighting off since May relegated him to the shower crashes down onto his chest. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s gonna die. And his last word&rsquo;s gonna be &ldquo;Stay.&rdquo; </p><p>And it&rsquo;s gonna play over in Tony&rsquo;s mind forever. The way he said it, so desperate and agonised and terrified. </p><p>He thinks he&rsquo;s gonna throw up till Bruce goes, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gonna be okay.&rdquo;, and he exhales like a storm wind.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, thank god. Bruce. Thank you. Thank you so much. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;if you hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, thank <i>god.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bruce chuckles. &ldquo;I gave him both chlorpromazine and the diazepam and it stopped the convulsions. He&rsquo;s got everything he needs now. Scans are showing that his body &ndash; you know, his enhanced metabolism and the healing factor &ndash; they&rsquo;re reacting well to it &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t have enough antibiotics or antitoxins on the plane to combat it properly but now I do, and it&rsquo;s turning itself around.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s shaking his head at him, grinning. &ldquo;I could kiss you. You know what?&rdquo; He takes Bruce&rsquo;s head in both hands and smacks his forehead with a big kiss. &ldquo;I can and did. You beautiful man. Thank you, Brucie. You&rsquo;re a myth and a legend.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce blushes and smiles. He was never good at being complimented. &ldquo;You can see him if you like. I didn&rsquo;t sedate him, but he&rsquo;s asleep anyway. I can still keep an eye on his brain activity that way. He isn&rsquo;t in nearly as much pain, either. That&mdash;that was a priority.&rdquo;</p><p>For a second, Tony considers the fact that there in fact very well may be a god.</p><hr /><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t sleep for long. He&rsquo;s slept more in the past couple days than he probably has in the last month, and although the pain is lessened, it still can&rsquo;t be pleasant enough to let him stay out for long.</p><p>Tony just sends up his thanks that he&rsquo;s not seizing anymore. </p><p>Bruce does some simple tests on him and seems satisfied. </p><p>May is there, and she sits beside his head as he groggily turns into her thigh. She whispers to him, and he squeezes her hand to let her know he&rsquo;s alright. She cries a little at first, murmuring, &ldquo;Hey, baby. Hello, Petey. Does it hurt? I know you&rsquo;re hurting, baby.&rdquo; to him and this makes him move even closer into her. He rubs her hand clumsily.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a reflection of exactly what she&rsquo;s been doing whilst he slept, and Tony once again can&rsquo;t help but think on how much they&rsquo;ve rubbed off on each other.</p><p>But then she mentions that he&rsquo;s in a hospital, and the realisation that he&rsquo;s not at home must break through the fog of his sleepy mind, because he sort-of comes to himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Don&rsquo;t you move that neck of yours, Peter Parker.&rdquo; May warns. Unsettled, Peter tries to swallow and gags on it, and she gingerly strokes his throat to calm him down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. Tony&rsquo;s here. Okay? You&rsquo;re safe and you&rsquo;re getting looked after, and,&rdquo; she lowers her tone and catches his cheek to get his full attention, &ldquo;the more you stress out, the longer it&rsquo;ll take for you to get better. You&rsquo;ve been really sick, baby. I was scared.&rdquo;</p><p>He gasps twice, convulsively, then settles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, honey. You&rsquo;ll set Tony off too. You know what he&rsquo;s like.&rdquo; She looks up at him and winks. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t really know what Peter&rsquo;s doing when he eases his right hand out of May&rsquo;s hold and replaces it with his left, but he doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to grab it when it&rsquo;s held out behind him expectantly. &ldquo;Yep, I&rsquo;m here, kiddo.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squeezes it for a long while. Tony does it back, two quick squeezes like his mom used to do to his knee when he needed reassurance. </p><p>His skin is pale and cold. &ldquo;Damn, kid! Cold heart, cold hands, huh? Hold on, Ice Queen Elsa.&rdquo; Tony blows warm air onto it and he swears he sees the corner of Peter&rsquo;s mouth twitch up beneath the new, smaller, <i>quieter </i>oxygen mask. </p><p>&ldquo;Bruce says he thinks he&rsquo;ll have his voice back by tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your healing factor just needed a nudge in the right direction, huh?&rdquo; Tony asks Peter, who had been looking up at both at them as they chatted quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s basically what he said, yeah.&rdquo; May smiles. &ldquo;Well, at least now he&rsquo;s been humbled to the trials and tribulations of us <i>normies</i> without our super duper fancy healing powers.&rdquo; She teases. </p><p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have gotten something a little less dramatic, next time, could he? I already have a heart condition.&rdquo; Peter crushes his hand fiercely. Tony pats it with his other hand, laughing. &ldquo;Kidding, kid. But, seriously, please don&rsquo;t do that again. I know you&rsquo;ll be desperate to repeat this fun experience, but I can&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo; May nods meaningfully at Peter, eyebrows raised. Tony sighs. &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;d better go and get all that stuff done that Pepper&rsquo;s been hounding me about. You&rsquo;re staying here?&rdquo; He asks May.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Got my four poster.&rdquo; She jerks her head to the cot behind her. &ldquo;5 stars, that is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well there&rsquo;s a room here for you when he&rsquo;s better. <i>Real</i> four poster.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I expect nothing less, Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony presses his knuckles to Peter&rsquo;s temple and murmurs his goodbyes, then heads out. He doesn&rsquo;t want to go, but May&rsquo;s there, and he&rsquo;s sure they can do with some privacy.</p><p>Turns out that Pepper&rsquo;s first and only Big Task for him is to get some shuteye. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t even try to fight her on it.</p><hr /><p>Very early the next morning, FRIDAY tells him May is heading to shower, so he heads down. </p><p>Bruce is intercepting a nurse who&rsquo;s carrying a fresh catheter drainage bag. He takes it from her and smiles, then sees Tony and waves. He&rsquo;s wearing the white coat he normally wears in the lab, with the addition of a stethoscope and the fact that it&rsquo;s<i> clean</i> for once.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at you, all rested and professional. Look at this!&rdquo; He flicks the drum of the stethoscope. &ldquo;Dashing. God, you better watch out you don&rsquo;t get done for fraud. Anyone would think those PhDs were actually in medicine.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce laughs at that. &ldquo;Well&hellip; yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s he doing? He speaking yet?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce shakes his head. &ldquo;Not yet. He&rsquo;s responding well to everything we&rsquo;re giving him. Basically everything bothering him now is from the neck upwards.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re going in the right direction? Sounds like it&rsquo;s basically put itself into rewind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s it. The only thing is that his blood pressure&rsquo;s kind of unstable. It&rsquo;s giving him some vertigo and a bad headache, so I&rsquo;m not going to reduce the analgesia yet. I get the feeling his pain tolerance is&hellip; one to be matched. His heart rate&rsquo;s still high and he seems a bit&mdash;&rdquo; he mimes moving a stiff neck, &ldquo;reluctant to move it, you know? But I don&rsquo;t really have a reason to believe that won&rsquo;t right itself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Cool. That&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can go in - and take this. I&rsquo;ll be with you soon.&rdquo; Tony takes the catheter bag and pushes through the doors. </p><p>Peter still looks sick as a dog, but he&rsquo;s on the nasal cannula now, and he seems to be in a more comfortable position. </p><p>The head of the bed has been raised somewhat, so he sees Tony when he enters. He waves at him dopily, and it makes Tony grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Kid! The Ban-man says you&rsquo;re feeling a little better. That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter can manage more of a smile now. It&rsquo;s all lopsided, and it looks funny and heart-warming all at once. </p><p>Once Tony&rsquo;s sat beside him, cross-legged and beaming back, he seems satisfied enough to close his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Bruce says you&rsquo;ve been getting some vertigo. Dizzy, huh?&rdquo; Peter quirks another half-smile in confirmation.</p><p>He suddenly remembers being back on the highway, Peter hunched over himself as he tries not to pass out. His chest tightens and he looks long and hard at the kid.</p><p>Peter opens an eye and looks at him. They share a look for a while before Tony speaks again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re sick, kiddo.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes narrow. They practically <i>scream</i> at him not to apologise. Tony snickers. He can&rsquo;t wait to be berated by the kid when he finally gets his voice back. </p><p>In all honesty, he can&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>He chuckles again when Peter doesn&rsquo;t stop glaring. &ldquo;Okay, alright! No more self-pitying. God, you&rsquo;re mean. That&rsquo;s my favourite pastime.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes roll up into his eyelids as they close. &ldquo;I can<i> taste</i> the sarcasm on your tongue, kiddo. How can you do that when you can&rsquo;t even speak? Kids are so weird and moody these days.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter quirks an eyebrow without opening his eyes. Tony sighs and ruffles his hair. &ldquo;Get some more sleep, Pete.&rdquo; He earns a thumbs-up for that.</p><p>The room is quiet for a while. It&rsquo;s not an awkward one, but comfortable &ndash; like when they&rsquo;d been driving only a week ago and they&rsquo;d both fallen into companionable silence. Tony relishes it.</p><p>He decides he may as well relax too. He leans back in his chair, arms crossed, and shuts his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Gotta admit, s&rsquo;a bit weird that <i>you</i> brought in th&rsquo;bag th&rsquo;s gunna hold my pee. Think unnerving is th&rsquo;word.&rdquo;</p><p>The next second, Tony&rsquo;s jumping out of his skin so high he thinks he&rsquo;ll be a naked skeleton for the rest of his life, and Peter&rsquo;s laughing his whispery, croaking laugh that is nothing but music to his ears.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mis&rsquo;r</i> <i>S&rsquo;ark</i>!&rdquo; Peter mimics back. He&rsquo;s sick, and he&rsquo;s shaky, and his voice is weak and quiet, but he&rsquo;s <i>smiling</i>. Really <i>smiling.</i> Tony is grinning like a fool back at him.</p><p>He leans forward and gathers the kid in his arms for a cautious hug. &ldquo;You little scoundrel!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hugs him back harder than Tony&rsquo;s hugging him, and he pushes his nose into his neck. &ldquo;S&rsquo;rry, man. C&rsquo;d&rsquo;nt resist.&rdquo;</p><p>When they lean back, Peter&rsquo;s smile has changed. It&rsquo;s a quiet kind of smile. &ldquo;Thanks f&rsquo;r lookin&rsquo; out f&rsquo;r me, Mis&rsquo;r S&rsquo;ark. And&hellip; s&rsquo;rry f&rsquo;r scarin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome kid. Just&hellip; no repeats, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods and then winces. He laughs at himself whilst Tony scowls at his pain. &ldquo;Hey, you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. M&rsquo;okay.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;About as okay as you can be, all things considered, I guess. How&rsquo;s the headache?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blech.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ll move you down.&rdquo; He grabs the control and lowers the head of the bed. &ldquo;Bit better?&rdquo; Peter sends him another thumbs up. &ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</p><p>The same calm quiet comes back, but Tony doesn&rsquo;t settle down again. He watches Peter&rsquo;s vitals for a while, then the kid himself. He&rsquo;s not sleeping, he knows he&rsquo;s feeling a little too unwell to settle down completely. But he doesn&rsquo;t feel that same sinking hopelessness in his stomach anymore. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey. M&rsquo;s&rsquo;r S&rsquo;rk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were sleeping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shh. Say, &lsquo;yes, P&rsquo;t&rsquo;r?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, P&rsquo;t&rsquo;r?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shh</i>. Properly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>&rsquo;D&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be a pain &lsquo;n th&rsquo;neck.&rsquo;</i> Remember? <i>Foreshad&rsquo;wing.</i>&rdquo; He says reverently. The giddiness is evident in his voice.</p><p>Tony practically rolls his eyes into his skull. &ldquo;How long have you been sitting on that one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since th&rsquo;plane.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are the absolute worst, Parker.&rdquo; Tony laughs. He puts a hand through Peter&rsquo;s hair and smiles at him. Peter smiles back, till Tony&rsquo;s face falls. &ldquo;Wait a damn second. &lsquo;Foreshadowing&rsquo;? Are you saying<i> I&rsquo;m</i> to blame for this?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter grins and shuts his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Nuh-uh, no pulling the sleep card. Are you saying I injected you with tetanus, Mr Parker?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sleepin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night, M&rsquo;s&rsquo;r S&rsquo;rk.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I am so leaving you in California next time.&rdquo;</p>",

He was nice to me, he used to look after me when I was in the tower. Second, he is Steve&rsquo;s weakness&rdquo; you smiled innocently at them.</p><p>She smiled back at you &ldquo;of course. We will get him for you&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;Present Time&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;We found Loki and Y/N&rdquo; Black Widow informed everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody touches my brother&rdquo; Thor warned everyone &ldquo;I will talk to him&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt Y/N&rdquo; Tony added.</p><p>&ldquo;Avoid hurting them at all cost&rdquo; T'Challa ordered &ldquo;Erik is my cousin, I will bring him to Wakanda alive&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark I saw Y/N&rdquo; Peter called the attention of your father &ldquo;I&rsquo;m following her&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way&rdquo; Tony left everyone.</p><p>You wore your Iron Man suit and flew away. However, Spiderman managed to capture you with his web.</p><p>Before Tony arrived Loki put the little spider into an illusion that he created.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; your father called you &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I know who you are, father&rdquo; at the moment you got freed from the web you flew away from him.</p><p>You flew faster than him and you started to shoot him but he just followed you.</p><p>Behind your mask, you were crying. You should be mad at him, right? He hurt you before that&rsquo;s why you left. But why are you hurting when you&rsquo;re shooting him? Why are you scared that he might get hurt? Why do you want to protect him from the monster he created?</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; Tony called your name.</p><p>He was surprised when you turned to the God of Mischief.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is my daughter?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Loki huffed &ldquo;daughter? You are really funny. She is nothing but disappointment to you, right? Pretending to be a loving father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Tony shot Loki.</p><p>It was too late when he realized that it was an illusion. He shot you and you were falling fast.</p><p>He flew as fast as he can to catch you. The Winter Soldier caught you in his arms. He was flying with Hela and Killmonger.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky&rdquo; Tony called his name &ldquo;give me my daughter! Give me Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>Loki set Peter free from the illusion he created for him to witness everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark&rdquo; the boy looked at Iron Man and the Executioners.</p><p>Bucky removed your mask and let Tony saw you face &ldquo;how pitiful, she was killed by her own father&rdquo; Hela sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up! I&rsquo;ll kill all of you&rdquo; Tony was about to shoot them again but Loki used his powers to teleport you back to your secret place.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter called his attention.</p><p>T'Challa and the others found Tony floating and not saying anything.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t say a word on their way back to the Tower.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what happened&rdquo; Steve ordered.</p><p>Peter looked down and Steve looked at Tony &ldquo;Stark, tell me what happened&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I killed Y/N! I killed my own daughter! I killed her! I killed her with my hands!&rdquo; Tony shouted &ldquo;I killed my daughter&rdquo; he sobbed.</p><p>Nat rubbed his back while he was crying &ldquo;Loki tricked me. I thought I was talking to Loki then I shoot him but it was Y/N. It&rsquo;s my Y/N&rdquo; he cried.</p><p>T'Challa approached Fury &ldquo;are you happy? You give us an order to get them dead or alive even if you know that they are a family member?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are just protecting the lives of innocent people&rdquo; Fury insisted.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that a murderer is an innocent? A rapist is innocent?&rdquo; T'Challa asked.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a proper way to settle things&rdquo; Agent Hill sided with Fury.</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why those criminals got freed? Is this what you call justice? If your thinking that those criminals are worth to protect them maybe I&rsquo;m in the wrong side&rdquo; the king of Wakanda left them.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; Bucky asked Hela.</p><p>&ldquo;She is sleeping&rdquo; she answered.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you come on your own&rdquo; Killmonger smirked, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s surprising&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to protect Y/N from all of you&rdquo; Bucky looked at the three.</p><p>Loki walked behind him &ldquo;you&rsquo;re one of us. A monster&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;This is where you belong Sgt Barnes&rdquo; Killmonger added, &ldquo;you killed innocent people for Hydra but it&rsquo;s time for you to make things right&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not different from Hydra&rdquo; Bucky glared at Killmonger.</p><p>&ldquo;You come here on your own will&rdquo; Loki reminded him and he gave him a bunch of folders &ldquo;we always do a further investigation about the criminals that we kill&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know? We always left a recorder in the crime scene?&rdquo; Hela added, &ldquo;where they confess everything&rdquo;.</p><p>Your room was too dark. You never let a single light come in.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always wondering why your room is always dark like this&rdquo; you heard a familiar voice, it was Bucky.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel calm in the dark&rdquo; you told him.</p><p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t see anything&rdquo; you can feel that he didn&rsquo;t move from where he was standing &ldquo;we are so worried about you&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;They are nice&rdquo; you started &ldquo;they are just misunderstood and unloved&rdquo;.</p><p>He remain silent for a while &ldquo;you can go back to the tower if you want&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I will stay here, I will protect you&rdquo; Bucky insisted.</p><p>&ldquo;You will go against Steve?&rdquo; you asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe I will go against the criminals&rdquo; he corrected your words &ldquo;how are you feeling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My body aches but my heart bleeds&rdquo; you honestly answered his question.</p><p>You conversation got interrupted by a knock on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, Y/N. You may want to go out we have a visitor&rdquo; Hela informed you.</p><p>You sat down and turned on the lamp beside your bed. Bucky looked puzzled and so where you.</p><p>Tony was in your room, staring at your picture that was displayed on your desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; he covered his face while sobbing &ldquo;your dad is a monster&rdquo;.</p><h2><a href=\"https://v-2bucky.tumblr.com/post/177071454342/envy-hearts-5\"><b>Part 5</b></a></h2><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\n\n<b>A/N: Let me know if you are not receiving notification or you want to be removed from the tag list.</b>\u00a0 <b>Feedbacks and reblogs are highly appreacited.</b><br/></p><p>Permanent list: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4gNfapjvq9iI8Tsf6ufOlA\">@wintersoldierbaby</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL_C0ZJJB5Fn24BzDlsD47Q\">@dolphinpink310</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxH7wxHGU-cBRB1UvtSYo-w\">@not-zari-tak</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-wyuJHgzVafbzUhdbOe3Hw\">@potter-thinking</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZ_K3kHUcWK7sOBgeLmwBaw\">@lanijoyxo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUz0gbBaxEiZ5jBDWpIEQWA\">@theblueinyour-eyes</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwlgu2ak82qn73DGNrYSf6Q\">@marvel-fan-queen</a>\u200b\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdF_OjbAai8vGsVpH3y_Wkg\">@thehuntress26</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3z8elk82Qi-xJ8B2OajTPQ\">@galaxies-inside-my-head</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbgCK4NETm23uYtIEABN6-A\">@thefridgeismybestie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGHUx5CQHTQpHzQC66r66rA\">@berruneko09</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mytnhz-S6XOv6iPT0s0nFZg\">@yeahbutmarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwcCSV3RedamEix_pIH17UQ\">@untoldshortsofthefandoms</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myGr3ZeLh2sZf-NxC2T_eTA\">@imreadinggoaway</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCjc4XTyN9b6f7D_OJV5pvA\">@crazybutconfidentaf</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvH3SiKx4FblJ4hyCGA43IA\">@spn-marvel-nerd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maDSWY_t1iWMlPFrSGaDIOw\">@chonisberonica</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meLZRtVe8rmhaXM2aukkAAA\">@breezy1415</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHDyki7tKBASJEBeSaciGzg\">@youtubehelpsmesurvive</a></p><p>Envy Hearts: \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maw1fwrcneL4ltYG5pVXbMw\">@writings-of-a-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRVTn1jahXLpD9Wr4-8Q1cA\">@bulbachu13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGpGUuRCz1C0IjMY8thEKw\">@parkerthehero</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9itfvWY379da4gAXOQGqsA\">@thanosismybitxh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn4HJ3fXqX3D7gNKtzFl0bw\">@sparkling-gayyy</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\">@vxidnik</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-2-KUtFuaxla9CjtNkVrlA\">@thewritten-angel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTk89-28djsR0ViByuaBTDg\">@spicygrethan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrnAplFIKY7jLkSO_Un18w\">@thequeensardine</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwJ18mBjk6Q-KLY7xxfzSQg\">@monstersdreamers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m32gA_h2XVKj-lmfoTHN9nw\">@maddie-laufeyson</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS-8Okt_PAG4scHoYDbdX2w\">@basicmarvelbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8_po9u4DTeT1HWIx8HasnQ\">@aetherisseraphin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFLLfRzsMdvZDKr3jk3mGiQ\">@letthembehappymcu</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkEX1FPpJYm0HzyQWtnT8cA\">@n-erdy-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJiptRtVRxrlzA1ucmISLw\">@wantonmeep</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWSnC5IDSBS-aq8xoC2AiBg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWSnC5IDSBS-aq8xoC2AiBg\">@mega-trash-cringe</a></p>",
