Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br/></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 3.5k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and sexual themes </p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/43202189\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><!-- more --><p>For a split second, Phil thought that maybe this idea wasn\u2019t the smartest. It wasn\u2019t exactly the most fool proof and he was sure that something bad was bound to happen. For one: he had no idea what it even meant to arrive to an airport and have a private jet waiting for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tThat in itself was quite over whelming.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor two: he had no idea how it even went to ride on a private jet. All he knew was that Dan\u2019s bodyguard and a few other people who neglected to introduce themselves were also on the same plane and he felt a bit\u2026out of place. Especially so with his Adidas bag as his \u2018carry on\u2019 luggage.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis brother Martyn was watching Spike for the week and Phil had dropped him off before running to the airport after being stuck in traffic. Dan had reassured him that he plane would not leave without him\u2015contrary to every other commercial plane. But Phil still felt like he had to rush to get there.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it was an entirely different feeling stepping off from the plane and being in sunny Los Angeles with the warmth kissing his skin. He\u2019s escorted away to a private car by Joshua which should feel weird but Phil honestly finds it comforting knowing he had Dan\u2019s bodyguard to protect him from any weird paparazzi or people.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets into the back of the car and relaxes into the seat as the driver pulls away. He opens his phone and sends a text to Dan saying that he was here and on his way to his house\u2026his house. Man, Phil didn\u2019t quite know what to expect knowing he was about to see Dan\u2019s house. Should he be nervous? Should he be excited? What is the proper reaction to seeing someone famous\u2019s house for the first time?\u00a0</p><p>\tNothing is said by anyone in the car the entire time they\u2019re driving. If Phil wasn\u2019t so overwhelmed by the entire ordeal, he might have used some of his abilities to start small talk with the driver but instead, he\u2019s left speechless.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt doesn\u2019t take long for them to get to where they need to be and soon, Phil feels his breath leave his body as he gets to see what Los Angeles is beginning to look like\u2015minus the heavy traffic that was currently holding them up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe took some photos for himself to keep as a memory and he added a snapshot to his Instastory so that way he could brag to his friends back home where he was. He knew that they would all be waiting and watching over social media for anything that he may say or post.\u00a0</p><p>\tNot to mention, he\u2019s sure his name is going to be on some news sites by the end of the evening anyway. He can imagine it now. DAN HOWELL\u2019S NEW BEAU ARRIVES IN LOS ANGELES or something like that. He feels a bit exasperated even at the thought of it.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey crest up a steep hill and suddenly, they\u2019re heading towards bigger and bigger mansions and Phil feels his heart stop a bit in his throat. He knew that Dan\u2019s popularity and celebrity status would obviously mean that he would have a massive house but he was sure that the house they just passed was one of the Kardashian\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d Phil found his voice ringing out in the dead silence of the car. The driver turned his head slightly in recognition of Phil getting his attention. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThe Hollywood Hills.\u201d The driver answers calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan\u2019s house is up here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe driver nods. \u201cMr. Howell\u2019s house is right up here. Just have to turn here and ring through the gate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sat back and watched as the driver took a right turn and suddenly was confronted by a gate with a code on the side. The driver put in the code and the gates shuddered before they began to open slowly, allowing for the driver to pass through.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe drove down the straight road until they reached a semi-circle and the driver pulled around. In full view was Dan\u2019s home, sat back away from everything else. It was pristine white with a beautiful fountain in front of it. It wasn\u2019t nearly as big as all of those mansions that Phil had seen but it still blew his mind when the driver stepped out and opened his door for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil grabbed his bag and stepped out onto the pavement of the driveway. He took in a deep breath and reached up, anxiously pushing his glasses further on his nose in a nervous habit. He began to walk forward, not even sure where to go in when he sees Dan, stood on the steps of his house with his arms crossed loosely over his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had the overwhelming urge to run over and pick him up, squeezing him tight and just hugging him until they can\u2019t breathe. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he tried to, as calmly as one could when they were shaking, walk over to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan flashed his massive blinding smile at Phil and Phil flashed it back and suddenly, his bag was dropped to the ground as Dan wrapped his arms around him in a hug and held on tight. This was the first contact that they\u2019d ever had but Phil honestly wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s hug was genuine and warm and all Phil wanted to do was never let him go. He felt Dan\u2019s face press into his neck as his grip tightened for a moment and then loosed. Phil let go and Dan let go too and they just looked at each other.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could kiss him. He really could and maybe he will?\u00a0</p><p>\tIt would be so easy to lean in and just do it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe begins to lean in and Dan looks like he\u2019s going to lean in too but\u2026</p><p>\t\u201cDan? Where did you go? We\u2019re not done going over what we\u2019re setting up for the party tonight!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMarianne, Dan\u2019s manager, came rushing out the door after them and whatever moment they were sharing was gone just as fast as it had came.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan rolled his eyes and waved her off. \u201cTell Jess and Morgan that I\u2019ll be back in a moment. Whatever they\u2019re setting up can\u2019t be that important anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil furrowed his brows and when Dan turned back, he sensed the confusion that read on Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m hosting a party tonight here at my house because apparently that\u2019s what I have to do and my team are just busy setting up the decorations and everything else now. The caterer and the musicians will be around a bit later and this is all a bit of a hectic day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laughed nervously and Phil nodded because he really just wanted to spend the day with Dan. He wanted to be alone with Dan and just\u2026he just wanted to be with Dan. No one else. Just him and Dan, cuddling or doing something more in Dan\u2019s bed as they indulged in lost time.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil really wanted to ask Dan on a date\u2026and even better, maybe ask Dan if he\u2019d like to be his boyfriend. But that\u2019s a bit hard if Dan\u2019s going to have hoards of people over tonight for a party.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cThe timing was just pretty shit if I\u2019m being honest but they wouldn\u2019t really budge for the date since invitations went out for it like three weeks ago. I promise that the rest of the time you\u2019re here, there will be no one else around. It\u2019ll be just us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and forces a smile to Dan who just smiles back gently.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Dan continues.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad I\u2019m here too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want something to eat? Or would you like a place to rest for a bit? I know how jet lag is so I can show you my room and you can take a little nap?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded because he would love to take a nap for a few hours to try and catch up on sleep. He would absolutely love to just lay down in the plush comforter and pillows that he sees every time Dan Skype\u2019s him.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan motions him inside and Phil follows him, immediately feeling his breath hitch at the sight of the inside of Dan\u2019s home. There is a grand staircase front and center when you walk in, and behind that, Phil can see an open area with what looks to be a TV and a living room set up. And in the distance, just past the windows, he can see a pool overlooking the valley.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan takes him up the stairs and Phil follows as they head towards Dan\u2019s bedroom. Dan pushes the door open and when Phil walks inside, his jaw drops. A massive king bed took up majority of the wall but that didn\u2019t account for the rest of the stunning decor that laid around the room and on the walls.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis bed was covered in a black grey duvet with big fluffy pillows and an ottoman in the front held a brand new sparkling suit and a pair of shoes\u2015obviously for the party. Phil walks in further and looks out the left side, seeing a balcony with sliding glass doors and those billowy white curtains that Phil always thought looked cliche in romance novels.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mess.\u201d Dan says, rubbing his neck. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t really had the motivation to clean it up or anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan, this is stunning.\u201d Phil says, turning around and dropping his bag. \u201cEverything about your house is just stunning.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan bites his lip and flashes red. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s a bit much but\u2026it\u2019s nice every once and a while to indulge in the perks, I guess?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the bed, his feet carrying himself before he can even comprehend where he\u2019s going. He presses his hand on the duvet and pushes down, feeling the feathery weight under his hand. He takes a seat and toes off his sneakers, hoping Dan won\u2019t mind, and feels himself sink into the mattress.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou look like you\u2019re in heaven, mate.\u201d Dan says with a laugh. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to sleep here for a little bit. I have to go back downstairs to make sure Marianne and the team aren\u2019t fucking anything up but I\u2019ll come up and wake you up if you start sleeping too long.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and turns to him. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods back and smiles before he turns on his heels and leaves the room, shutting the door behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lays down on the bed and feels his body sink into it. He closes his eyes, taking off his glasses and setting them to the side, and just relaxes into it. He could get used to being here, sharing this bed with Dan.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know how long he sleeps for, or really know even when he falls asleep. But when he wakes up, Dan is laying beside him in bed, his own eyes shut in a peaceful slumber.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets the urge to reach over and stroke a stray piece of his hair off from his eyes. But he doesn\u2019t. He just watches as Dan\u2019s face crinkles up a bit in his sleep and then relaxes. He finds himself rolling closer, wanting to experience what it\u2019s like to cuddle with Dan\u2015and especially one who is sleepy.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reaches out and arm and puts his hand on Dan\u2019s side, feeling the warmth travel through his touch. Dan stirs and Phil jumps, immediately thinking that his was a mistake and he\u2019s breached some line that he shouldn\u2019t have. But instead, Dan\u2019s eyes open just a little bit and he smiles gently at Phil before he throws his arm over Phil\u2019s chest and scooches forward.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s head comes to rest on Phil\u2019s chest and Dan\u2019s body is practically covering Phil\u2019s at this point, but he doesn\u2019t care in the slightest. Dan\u2019s weight and warmth is grounding for him and he wraps his arms around him, holding him just the way he wanted to, and lets his eyes drift back off into sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he wakes up again, Dan is sat on the edge of the bed, stretching his arms up and then reaching down to unwrinkle his shirt that had gotten wrinkled as they slept. Dan scratches his side and then turns his head and his lips curl up in a smile as he sees Phil awake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey, didn\u2019t mean to wake you up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIs it okay that we cuddled?\u201d Dan asked, his voice getting a bit more airy and serious. \u201cBecause I know I can get a bit clingy when I sleep but I didn\u2019t want to cross any lines.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. \u201cI really loved cuddling with you actually.\u201d He smiles wider. \u201cI really would like to do more of that actually.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laughs and lets out a snort as he stands up. \u201cMaybe later. But my party begins in a few hours and I need to get ready and I\u2019m assuming you will have to too. And I also want to eat something before it begins as well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and begins to sit up, putting his glasses on as he swings his legs out to the edge of the bed and begins to stand on wobbly limbs. He\u2019s still a bit jet-lagged, nowhere near as bad as he was before.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s about to walk to his bag and pull out some clothes when he\u2019s hit with the sudden realization that he did not pack anything for a party. Nothing he brought would be suitable for Dan\u2019s party.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything to wear.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looks up from where he\u2019s stood at the end of his ottoman. \u201cYou can just borrow something of mine?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat is how two hours later, Phil ends up in the middle of a party that is definitely in full swing with a small plate of Hors d\u2019oeuvres in his hand. He\u2019s not quite sure where to begin or even how to begin.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is by his side but it\u2019s been hard to really know what he\u2019s supposed to do in these situations when Dan is currently downing his third cocktail of the evening and Phil isn\u2019t even sure where his went.\u00a0</p><p>\tThere had to be over 300 people in Dan\u2019s house. It felt like people were packed like sardines inside the walls and Phil felt a bit overwhelmed. But at least this part was classy compared to the university parties that he used to go to as a student.\u00a0</p><p>\tThese people were all dressed in fine and fancy dresses and well groomed tuxes. They sipped Champagne and ate finger foods and mingled with everyone else. There was no crazy lights or music or really anything that would scream a crazy party to Phil.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it\u2019s just that these were all high profile celebrities and here was Phil, trying to find his way through the crowd to follow Dan, all the while trying to not spill his plate of food on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan tried to introduce him to some of his friends. Many of them he did recognize from TV shows and even other movies. But a lot of them he didn\u2019t know and he wanted to remain polite so he just nodded slowly and smiled as if he did know who they were.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it was hard for him to navigate all of the people and to find people he actually felt like he could speak to. A lot of them weren\u2019t even the same social class as Phil and it was quite obvious in the way they held themselves in comparison to Phil who, frankly, had no fucking clue what he was doing.\u00a0</p><p>\tWithin a few hours, he was a bit exhausted already and he could tell Dan was as well. But everywhere Dan went, he went, and when he find himself getting too claustrophobic, he walked out the sliding glass doors onto the patio with the pool where less people were mingling.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe found a seat on a bench by the poolside and set down his plate and cursed himself for losing his actually really amazing cocktail. But it felt good to take a break away from everyone and not feel like he was fighting through the crowds.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not even entirely sure where Dan went either.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sits in silence all by himself as he eats the rest of his food and then gets out his cell phone to scroll through social media for a few. He\u2019s still scrolling through his phone when footsteps enter his thought and he looks up and sees Dan stood in front of him with two glasses in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hands one to Phil and then he takes a sip of his own before sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit much, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dan says, setting his glass onto the bench next to them. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit crazy actually when I look inside my own home and see everyone here. Like, I don\u2019t even know a quarter of these people.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is the party for?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs his shoulders. \u201cLiterally not even that sure to be honest. I think something to do with my film.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly and brings the rim of the glass up to his lips as he takes a drink and sets it down. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a party like this before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI never had either prior to me actually becoming a well-known somebody.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThey\u2019re just so overwhelming. Funnily enough, you snagged this bench to break away which is the same bench I go to when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful view, sitting here.\u201d Phil comments, pointing out to the valley that you see just beyond Dan\u2019s fence surrounding his pool.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few perks of owning this house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know quite what to say, so he brings up his glass and takes another sip of his drink. Dan beside him finishes off his own.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve felt something for you since we saw each other for the first time in London.\u201d Dan suddenly says. \u201cAnd I feel like if I don\u2019t say anything now while I\u2019m a bit buzzed than I won\u2019t. But I just wanted you to know that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve liked you since we met.\u201d Phil admits. \u201cI knew it was more than just a silly crush when I couldn\u2019t ever get you out of my head. I thought about you all the time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAll the time?\u201d Dan asks, raising an eyebrow. Phil feels his cheeks flush and he reaches out to swat gently at Dan\u2019s arm.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really like you, Phil.\u201d Dan says, turning his head to face him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels himself smile at the declaration before both them begin to lean in.\u00a0</p><p>\tTheir lips collide and Phil feels how perfectly they slot together, almost as if they were made for each other. Dan\u2019s hand comes up and his fingers weave through Phil\u2019s hair as he holds him close for the kiss.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels Dan\u2019s tongue swipe against his bottom lip and he opens his mouth to let Dan in as their kisses deepen. He feels his breath shorten and his hands move up on Dan\u2019s blazer, grabbing the lapels and pulling him closer.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was like fireworks going off in the distance. Dan\u2019s lips on Phil\u2019s felt perfect and natural. They were soft but also a bit dry but Phil didn\u2019t care. He pulled back from the kiss and looked at Dan, his lips red and swollen. He dove back forward and connected their lips again like their lives depended on it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know how long they actually kissed for and frankly, he doesn\u2019t care. When he pulls back for the second time, he looks at Dan and just smiles and laughs and Dan does the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything feels spectacular and right. Phil can already feel the fondness for Dan climbing higher and higher the longer that they sit together on the bench. Dan intertwines their fingers and Phil hold his hand close to his body as they sit.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe party continued behind them as they spoke the rest of the night away. They stole a few more kisses before they headed back inside as the party began to fizzle and people began to leave.\u00a0</p><p>\tBy the end of the night, they were back in Dan\u2019s bed together and Phil held Dan close, pressing little kisses on Dan\u2019s hair as they fell asleep.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything about this day was more than Phil could have ever asked for and he\u2019ll never forget it as long as he lives.\u00a0</p>",

It wasn\u2019t exactly the most fool proof and he was sure that something bad was bound to happen. For one: he had no idea what it even meant to arrive to an airport and have a private jet waiting for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tThat in itself was quite over whelming.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor two: he had no idea how it even went to ride on a private jet. All he knew was that Dan\u2019s bodyguard and a few other people who neglected to introduce themselves were also on the same plane and he felt a bit\u2026out of place. Especially so with his Adidas bag as his \u2018carry on\u2019 luggage.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis brother Martyn was watching Spike for the week and Phil had dropped him off before running to the airport after being stuck in traffic. Dan had reassured him that he plane would not leave without him\u2015contrary to every other commercial plane. But Phil still felt like he had to rush to get there.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it was an entirely different feeling stepping off from the plane and being in sunny Los Angeles with the warmth kissing his skin. He\u2019s escorted away to a private car by Joshua which should feel weird but Phil honestly finds it comforting knowing he had Dan\u2019s bodyguard to protect him from any weird paparazzi or people.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets into the back of the car and relaxes into the seat as the driver pulls away. He opens his phone and sends a text to Dan saying that he was here and on his way to his house\u2026his house. Man, Phil didn\u2019t quite know what to expect knowing he was about to see Dan\u2019s house. Should he be nervous? Should he be excited? What is the proper reaction to seeing someone famous\u2019s house for the first time?\u00a0</p><p>\tNothing is said by anyone in the car the entire time they\u2019re driving. If Phil wasn\u2019t so overwhelmed by the entire ordeal, he might have used some of his abilities to start small talk with the driver but instead, he\u2019s left speechless.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt doesn\u2019t take long for them to get to where they need to be and soon, Phil feels his breath leave his body as he gets to see what Los Angeles is beginning to look like\u2015minus the heavy traffic that was currently holding them up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe took some photos for himself to keep as a memory and he added a snapshot to his Instastory so that way he could brag to his friends back home where he was. He knew that they would all be waiting and watching over social media for anything that he may say or post.\u00a0</p><p>\tNot to mention, he\u2019s sure his name is going to be on some news sites by the end of the evening anyway. He can imagine it now. DAN HOWELL\u2019S NEW BEAU ARRIVES IN LOS ANGELES or something like that. He feels a bit exasperated even at the thought of it.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey crest up a steep hill and suddenly, they\u2019re heading towards bigger and bigger mansions and Phil feels his heart stop a bit in his throat.

Just have to turn here and ring through the gate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sat back and watched as the driver took a right turn and suddenly was confronted by a gate with a code on the side. The driver put in the code and the gates shuddered before they began to open slowly, allowing for the driver to pass through.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe drove down the straight road until they reached a semi-circle and the driver pulled around. In full view was Dan\u2019s home, sat back away from everything else. It was pristine white with a beautiful fountain in front of it. It wasn\u2019t nearly as big as all of those mansions that Phil had seen but it still blew his mind when the driver stepped out and opened his door for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil grabbed his bag and stepped out onto the pavement of the driveway. He took in a deep breath and reached up, anxiously pushing his glasses further on his nose in a nervous habit. He began to walk forward, not even sure where to go in when he sees Dan, stood on the steps of his house with his arms crossed loosely over his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had the overwhelming urge to run over and pick him up, squeezing him tight and just hugging him until they can\u2019t breathe. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he tried to, as calmly as one could when they were shaking, walk over to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan flashed his massive blinding smile at Phil and Phil flashed it back and suddenly, his bag was dropped to the ground as Dan wrapped his arms around him in a hug and held on tight. This was the first contact that they\u2019d ever had but Phil honestly wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s hug was genuine and warm and all Phil wanted to do was never let him go. He felt Dan\u2019s face press into his neck as his grip tightened for a moment and then loosed. Phil let go and Dan let go too and they just looked at each other.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could kiss him. He really could and maybe he will?\u00a0</p><p>\tIt would be so easy to lean in and just do it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe begins to lean in and Dan looks like he\u2019s going to lean in too but\u2026</p><p>\t\u201cDan? Where did you go? We\u2019re not done going over what we\u2019re setting up for the party tonight!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMarianne, Dan\u2019s manager, came rushing out the door after them and whatever moment they were sharing was gone just as fast as it had came.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan rolled his eyes and waved her off. \u201cTell Jess and Morgan that I\u2019ll be back in a moment. Whatever they\u2019re setting up can\u2019t be that important anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil furrowed his brows and when Dan turned back, he sensed the confusion that read on Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m hosting a party tonight here at my house because apparently that\u2019s what I have to do and my team are just busy setting up the decorations and everything else now. The caterer and the musicians will be around a bit later and this is all a bit of a hectic day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laughed nervously and Phil nodded because he really just wanted to spend the day with Dan. He wanted to be alone with Dan and just\u2026he just wanted to be with Dan. No one else. Just him and Dan, cuddling or doing something more in Dan\u2019s bed as they indulged in lost time.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil really wanted to ask Dan on a date\u2026and even better, maybe ask Dan if he\u2019d like to be his boyfriend. But that\u2019s a bit hard if Dan\u2019s going to have hoards of people over tonight for a party.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cThe timing was just pretty shit if I\u2019m being honest but they wouldn\u2019t really budge for the date since invitations went out for it like three weeks ago. I promise that the rest of the time you\u2019re here, there will be no one else around. It\u2019ll be just us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and forces a smile to Dan who just smiles back gently.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Dan continues.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad I\u2019m here too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want something to eat? Or would you like a place to rest for a bit? I know how jet lag is so I can show you my room and you can take a little nap?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded because he would love to take a nap for a few hours to try and catch up on sleep. He would absolutely love to just lay down in the plush comforter and pillows that he sees every time Dan Skype\u2019s him.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan motions him inside and Phil follows him, immediately feeling his breath hitch at the sight of the inside of Dan\u2019s home. There is a grand staircase front and center when you walk in, and behind that, Phil can see an open area with what looks to be a TV and a living room set up. And in the distance, just past the windows, he can see a pool overlooking the valley.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan takes him up the stairs and Phil follows as they head towards Dan\u2019s bedroom. Dan pushes the door open and when Phil walks inside, his jaw drops. A massive king bed took up majority of the wall but that didn\u2019t account for the rest of the stunning decor that laid around the room and on the walls.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis bed was covered in a black grey duvet with big fluffy pillows and an ottoman in the front held a brand new sparkling suit and a pair of shoes\u2015obviously for the party. Phil walks in further and looks out the left side, seeing a balcony with sliding glass doors and those billowy white curtains that Phil always thought looked cliche in romance novels.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mess.\u201d Dan says, rubbing his neck. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t really had the motivation to clean it up or anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan, this is stunning.\u201d Phil says, turning around and dropping his bag. \u201cEverything about your house is just stunning.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan bites his lip and flashes red. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s a bit much but\u2026it\u2019s nice every once and a while to indulge in the perks, I guess?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the bed, his feet carrying himself before he can even comprehend where he\u2019s going. He presses his hand on the duvet and pushes down, feeling the feathery weight under his hand. He takes a seat and toes off his sneakers, hoping Dan won\u2019t mind, and feels himself sink into the mattress.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou look like you\u2019re in heaven, mate.\u201d Dan says with a laugh. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to sleep here for a little bit. I have to go back downstairs to make sure Marianne and the team aren\u2019t fucking anything up but I\u2019ll come up and wake you up if you start sleeping too long.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and turns to him. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods back and smiles before he turns on his heels and leaves the room, shutting the door behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lays down on the bed and feels his body sink into it. He closes his eyes, taking off his glasses and setting them to the side, and just relaxes into it. He could get used to being here, sharing this bed with Dan.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know how long he sleeps for, or really know even when he falls asleep. But when he wakes up, Dan is laying beside him in bed, his own eyes shut in a peaceful slumber.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets the urge to reach over and stroke a stray piece of his hair off from his eyes. But he doesn\u2019t. He just watches as Dan\u2019s face crinkles up a bit in his sleep and then relaxes. He finds himself rolling closer, wanting to experience what it\u2019s like to cuddle with Dan\u2015and especially one who is sleepy.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reaches out and arm and puts his hand on Dan\u2019s side, feeling the warmth travel through his touch. Dan stirs and Phil jumps, immediately thinking that his was a mistake and he\u2019s breached some line that he shouldn\u2019t have. But instead, Dan\u2019s eyes open just a little bit and he smiles gently at Phil before he throws his arm over Phil\u2019s chest and scooches forward.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s head comes to rest on Phil\u2019s chest and Dan\u2019s body is practically covering Phil\u2019s at this point, but he doesn\u2019t care in the slightest. Dan\u2019s weight and warmth is grounding for him and he wraps his arms around him, holding him just the way he wanted to, and lets his eyes drift back off into sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he wakes up again, Dan is sat on the edge of the bed, stretching his arms up and then reaching down to unwrinkle his shirt that had gotten wrinkled as they slept. Dan scratches his side and then turns his head and his lips curl up in a smile as he sees Phil awake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey, didn\u2019t mean to wake you up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIs it okay that we cuddled?\u201d Dan asked, his voice getting a bit more airy and serious. \u201cBecause I know I can get a bit clingy when I sleep but I didn\u2019t want to cross any lines.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. \u201cI really loved cuddling with you actually.\u201d He smiles wider. \u201cI really would like to do more of that actually.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laughs and lets out a snort as he stands up. \u201cMaybe later. But my party begins in a few hours and I need to get ready and I\u2019m assuming you will have to too. And I also want to eat something before it begins as well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and begins to sit up, putting his glasses on as he swings his legs out to the edge of the bed and begins to stand on wobbly limbs. He\u2019s still a bit jet-lagged, nowhere near as bad as he was before.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s about to walk to his bag and pull out some clothes when he\u2019s hit with the sudden realization that he did not pack anything for a party. Nothing he brought would be suitable for Dan\u2019s party.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything to wear.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looks up from where he\u2019s stood at the end of his ottoman. \u201cYou can just borrow something of mine?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat is how two hours later, Phil ends up in the middle of a party that is definitely in full swing with a small plate of Hors d\u2019oeuvres in his hand. He\u2019s not quite sure where to begin or even how to begin.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is by his side but it\u2019s been hard to really know what he\u2019s supposed to do in these situations when Dan is currently downing his third cocktail of the evening and Phil isn\u2019t even sure where his went.\u00a0</p><p>\tThere had to be over 300 people in Dan\u2019s house. It felt like people were packed like sardines inside the walls and Phil felt a bit overwhelmed. But at least this part was classy compared to the university parties that he used to go to as a student.\u00a0</p><p>\tThese people were all dressed in fine and fancy dresses and well groomed tuxes. They sipped Champagne and ate finger foods and mingled with everyone else. There was no crazy lights or music or really anything that would scream a crazy party to Phil.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it\u2019s just that these were all high profile celebrities and here was Phil, trying to find his way through the crowd to follow Dan, all the while trying to not spill his plate of food on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan tried to introduce him to some of his friends. Many of them he did recognize from TV shows and even other movies. But a lot of them he didn\u2019t know and he wanted to remain polite so he just nodded slowly and smiled as if he did know who they were.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it was hard for him to navigate all of the people and to find people he actually felt like he could speak to. A lot of them weren\u2019t even the same social class as Phil and it was quite obvious in the way they held themselves in comparison to Phil who, frankly, had no fucking clue what he was doing.\u00a0</p><p>\tWithin a few hours, he was a bit exhausted already and he could tell Dan was as well. But everywhere Dan went, he went, and when he find himself getting too claustrophobic, he walked out the sliding glass doors onto the patio with the pool where less people were mingling.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe found a seat on a bench by the poolside and set down his plate and cursed himself for losing his actually really amazing cocktail. But it felt good to take a break away from everyone and not feel like he was fighting through the crowds.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not even entirely sure where Dan went either.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sits in silence all by himself as he eats the rest of his food and then gets out his cell phone to scroll through social media for a few. He\u2019s still scrolling through his phone when footsteps enter his thought and he looks up and sees Dan stood in front of him with two glasses in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hands one to Phil and then he takes a sip of his own before sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit much, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dan says, setting his glass onto the bench next to them. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit crazy actually when I look inside my own home and see everyone here. Like, I don\u2019t even know a quarter of these people.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is the party for?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs his shoulders. \u201cLiterally not even that sure to be honest. I think something to do with my film.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly and brings the rim of the glass up to his lips as he takes a drink and sets it down. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a party like this before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI never had either prior to me actually becoming a well-known somebody.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThey\u2019re just so overwhelming. Funnily enough, you snagged this bench to break away which is the same bench I go to when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful view, sitting here.\u201d Phil comments, pointing out to the valley that you see just beyond Dan\u2019s fence surrounding his pool.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few perks of owning this house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know quite what to say, so he brings up his glass and takes another sip of his drink. Dan beside him finishes off his own.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve felt something for you since we saw each other for the first time in London.\u201d Dan suddenly says. \u201cAnd I feel like if I don\u2019t say anything now while I\u2019m a bit buzzed than I won\u2019t. But I just wanted you to know that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve liked you since we met.\u201d Phil admits. \u201cI knew it was more than just a silly crush when I couldn\u2019t ever get you out of my head. I thought about you all the time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAll the time?\u201d Dan asks, raising an eyebrow. Phil feels his cheeks flush and he reaches out to swat gently at Dan\u2019s arm.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really like you, Phil.\u201d Dan says, turning his head to face him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels himself smile at the declaration before both them begin to lean in.\u00a0</p><p>\tTheir lips collide and Phil feels how perfectly they slot together, almost as if they were made for each other. Dan\u2019s hand comes up and his fingers weave through Phil\u2019s hair as he holds him close for the kiss.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels Dan\u2019s tongue swipe against his bottom lip and he opens his mouth to let Dan in as their kisses deepen. He feels his breath shorten and his hands move up on Dan\u2019s blazer, grabbing the lapels and pulling him closer.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was like fireworks going off in the distance. Dan\u2019s lips on Phil\u2019s felt perfect and natural. They were soft but also a bit dry but Phil didn\u2019t care. He pulled back from the kiss and looked at Dan, his lips red and swollen. He dove back forward and connected their lips again like their lives depended on it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know how long they actually kissed for and frankly, he doesn\u2019t care. When he pulls back for the second time, he looks at Dan and just smiles and laughs and Dan does the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything feels spectacular and right. Phil can already feel the fondness for Dan climbing higher and higher the longer that they sit together on the bench. Dan intertwines their fingers and Phil hold his hand close to his body as they sit.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe party continued behind them as they spoke the rest of the night away. They stole a few more kisses before they headed back inside as the party began to fizzle and people began to leave.\u00a0</p><p>\tBy the end of the night, they were back in Dan\u2019s bed together and Phil held Dan close, pressing little kisses on Dan\u2019s hair as they fell asleep.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything about this day was more than Phil could have ever asked for and he\u2019ll never forget it as long as he lives.\u00a0</p>",

Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 3.5k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and sexual themes </p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/43202189\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>For a split second, Phil thought that maybe this idea wasn\u2019t the smartest. It wasn\u2019t exactly the most fool proof and he was sure that something bad was bound to happen. For one: he had no idea what it even meant to arrive to an airport and have a private jet waiting for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tThat in itself was quite over whelming.\u00a0</p><p>\tFor two: he had no idea how it even went to ride on a private jet. All he knew was that Dan\u2019s bodyguard and a few other people who neglected to introduce themselves were also on the same plane and he felt a bit\u2026out of place. Especially so with his Adidas bag as his \u2018carry on\u2019 luggage.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis brother Martyn was watching Spike for the week and Phil had dropped him off before running to the airport after being stuck in traffic. Dan had reassured him that he plane would not leave without him\u2015contrary to every other commercial plane. But Phil still felt like he had to rush to get there.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it was an entirely different feeling stepping off from the plane and being in sunny Los Angeles with the warmth kissing his skin. He\u2019s escorted away to a private car by Joshua which should feel weird but Phil honestly finds it comforting knowing he had Dan\u2019s bodyguard to protect him from any weird paparazzi or people.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets into the back of the car and relaxes into the seat as the driver pulls away. He opens his phone and sends a text to Dan saying that he was here and on his way to his house\u2026his house. Man, Phil didn\u2019t quite know what to expect knowing he was about to see Dan\u2019s house. Should he be nervous? Should he be excited? What is the proper reaction to seeing someone famous\u2019s house for the first time?\u00a0</p><p>\tNothing is said by anyone in the car the entire time they\u2019re driving. If Phil wasn\u2019t so overwhelmed by the entire ordeal, he might have used some of his abilities to start small talk with the driver but instead, he\u2019s left speechless.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt doesn\u2019t take long for them to get to where they need to be and soon, Phil feels his breath leave his body as he gets to see what Los Angeles is beginning to look like\u2015minus the heavy traffic that was currently holding them up.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe took some photos for himself to keep as a memory and he added a snapshot to his Instastory so that way he could brag to his friends back home where he was. He knew that they would all be waiting and watching over social media for anything that he may say or post.\u00a0</p><p>\tNot to mention, he\u2019s sure his name is going to be on some news sites by the end of the evening anyway. He can imagine it now. DAN HOWELL\u2019S NEW BEAU ARRIVES IN LOS ANGELES or something like that. He feels a bit exasperated even at the thought of it.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey crest up a steep hill and suddenly, they\u2019re heading towards bigger and bigger mansions and Phil feels his heart stop a bit in his throat. He knew that Dan\u2019s popularity and celebrity status would obviously mean that he would have a massive house but he was sure that the house they just passed was one of the Kardashian\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d Phil found his voice ringing out in the dead silence of the car. The driver turned his head slightly in recognition of Phil getting his attention. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThe Hollywood Hills.\u201d The driver answers calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan\u2019s house is up here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe driver nods. \u201cMr. Howell\u2019s house is right up here. Just have to turn here and ring through the gate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sat back and watched as the driver took a right turn and suddenly was confronted by a gate with a code on the side. The driver put in the code and the gates shuddered before they began to open slowly, allowing for the driver to pass through.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe drove down the straight road until they reached a semi-circle and the driver pulled around. In full view was Dan\u2019s home, sat back away from everything else. It was pristine white with a beautiful fountain in front of it. It wasn\u2019t nearly as big as all of those mansions that Phil had seen but it still blew his mind when the driver stepped out and opened his door for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil grabbed his bag and stepped out onto the pavement of the driveway. He took in a deep breath and reached up, anxiously pushing his glasses further on his nose in a nervous habit. He began to walk forward, not even sure where to go in when he sees Dan, stood on the steps of his house with his arms crossed loosely over his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had the overwhelming urge to run over and pick him up, squeezing him tight and just hugging him until they can\u2019t breathe. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he tried to, as calmly as one could when they were shaking, walk over to Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan flashed his massive blinding smile at Phil and Phil flashed it back and suddenly, his bag was dropped to the ground as Dan wrapped his arms around him in a hug and held on tight. This was the first contact that they\u2019d ever had but Phil honestly wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s hug was genuine and warm and all Phil wanted to do was never let him go. He felt Dan\u2019s face press into his neck as his grip tightened for a moment and then loosed. Phil let go and Dan let go too and they just looked at each other.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil could kiss him. He really could and maybe he will?\u00a0</p><p>\tIt would be so easy to lean in and just do it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe begins to lean in and Dan looks like he\u2019s going to lean in too but\u2026</p><p>\t\u201cDan? Where did you go? We\u2019re not done going over what we\u2019re setting up for the party tonight!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMarianne, Dan\u2019s manager, came rushing out the door after them and whatever moment they were sharing was gone just as fast as it had came.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan rolled his eyes and waved her off. \u201cTell Jess and Morgan that I\u2019ll be back in a moment. Whatever they\u2019re setting up can\u2019t be that important anyway.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil furrowed his brows and when Dan turned back, he sensed the confusion that read on Phil\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m hosting a party tonight here at my house because apparently that\u2019s what I have to do and my team are just busy setting up the decorations and everything else now. The caterer and the musicians will be around a bit later and this is all a bit of a hectic day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laughed nervously and Phil nodded because he really just wanted to spend the day with Dan. He wanted to be alone with Dan and just\u2026he just wanted to be with Dan. No one else. Just him and Dan, cuddling or doing something more in Dan\u2019s bed as they indulged in lost time.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil really wanted to ask Dan on a date\u2026and even better, maybe ask Dan if he\u2019d like to be his boyfriend. But that\u2019s a bit hard if Dan\u2019s going to have hoards of people over tonight for a party.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Dan repeats. \u201cThe timing was just pretty shit if I\u2019m being honest but they wouldn\u2019t really budge for the date since invitations went out for it like three weeks ago. I promise that the rest of the time you\u2019re here, there will be no one else around. It\u2019ll be just us.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and forces a smile to Dan who just smiles back gently.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Dan continues.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m really glad I\u2019m here too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you want something to eat? Or would you like a place to rest for a bit? I know how jet lag is so I can show you my room and you can take a little nap?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded because he would love to take a nap for a few hours to try and catch up on sleep. He would absolutely love to just lay down in the plush comforter and pillows that he sees every time Dan Skype\u2019s him.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan motions him inside and Phil follows him, immediately feeling his breath hitch at the sight of the inside of Dan\u2019s home. There is a grand staircase front and center when you walk in, and behind that, Phil can see an open area with what looks to be a TV and a living room set up. And in the distance, just past the windows, he can see a pool overlooking the valley.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan takes him up the stairs and Phil follows as they head towards Dan\u2019s bedroom. Dan pushes the door open and when Phil walks inside, his jaw drops. A massive king bed took up majority of the wall but that didn\u2019t account for the rest of the stunning decor that laid around the room and on the walls.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis bed was covered in a black grey duvet with big fluffy pillows and an ottoman in the front held a brand new sparkling suit and a pair of shoes\u2015obviously for the party. Phil walks in further and looks out the left side, seeing a balcony with sliding glass doors and those billowy white curtains that Phil always thought looked cliche in romance novels.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mess.\u201d Dan says, rubbing his neck. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t really had the motivation to clean it up or anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDan, this is stunning.\u201d Phil says, turning around and dropping his bag. \u201cEverything about your house is just stunning.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan bites his lip and flashes red. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s a bit much but\u2026it\u2019s nice every once and a while to indulge in the perks, I guess?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the bed, his feet carrying himself before he can even comprehend where he\u2019s going. He presses his hand on the duvet and pushes down, feeling the feathery weight under his hand. He takes a seat and toes off his sneakers, hoping Dan won\u2019t mind, and feels himself sink into the mattress.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou look like you\u2019re in heaven, mate.\u201d Dan says with a laugh. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to sleep here for a little bit. I have to go back downstairs to make sure Marianne and the team aren\u2019t fucking anything up but I\u2019ll come up and wake you up if you start sleeping too long.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and turns to him. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods back and smiles before he turns on his heels and leaves the room, shutting the door behind him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil lays down on the bed and feels his body sink into it. He closes his eyes, taking off his glasses and setting them to the side, and just relaxes into it. He could get used to being here, sharing this bed with Dan.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know how long he sleeps for, or really know even when he falls asleep. But when he wakes up, Dan is laying beside him in bed, his own eyes shut in a peaceful slumber.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil gets the urge to reach over and stroke a stray piece of his hair off from his eyes. But he doesn\u2019t. He just watches as Dan\u2019s face crinkles up a bit in his sleep and then relaxes. He finds himself rolling closer, wanting to experience what it\u2019s like to cuddle with Dan\u2015and especially one who is sleepy.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe reaches out and arm and puts his hand on Dan\u2019s side, feeling the warmth travel through his touch. Dan stirs and Phil jumps, immediately thinking that his was a mistake and he\u2019s breached some line that he shouldn\u2019t have. But instead, Dan\u2019s eyes open just a little bit and he smiles gently at Phil before he throws his arm over Phil\u2019s chest and scooches forward.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s head comes to rest on Phil\u2019s chest and Dan\u2019s body is practically covering Phil\u2019s at this point, but he doesn\u2019t care in the slightest. Dan\u2019s weight and warmth is grounding for him and he wraps his arms around him, holding him just the way he wanted to, and lets his eyes drift back off into sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he wakes up again, Dan is sat on the edge of the bed, stretching his arms up and then reaching down to unwrinkle his shirt that had gotten wrinkled as they slept. Dan scratches his side and then turns his head and his lips curl up in a smile as he sees Phil awake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHey, didn\u2019t mean to wake you up.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIs it okay that we cuddled?\u201d Dan asked, his voice getting a bit more airy and serious. \u201cBecause I know I can get a bit clingy when I sleep but I didn\u2019t want to cross any lines.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. \u201cI really loved cuddling with you actually.\u201d He smiles wider. \u201cI really would like to do more of that actually.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laughs and lets out a snort as he stands up. \u201cMaybe later. But my party begins in a few hours and I need to get ready and I\u2019m assuming you will have to too. And I also want to eat something before it begins as well.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods and begins to sit up, putting his glasses on as he swings his legs out to the edge of the bed and begins to stand on wobbly limbs. He\u2019s still a bit jet-lagged, nowhere near as bad as he was before.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s about to walk to his bag and pull out some clothes when he\u2019s hit with the sudden realization that he did not pack anything for a party. Nothing he brought would be suitable for Dan\u2019s party.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything to wear.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan looks up from where he\u2019s stood at the end of his ottoman. \u201cYou can just borrow something of mine?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat is how two hours later, Phil ends up in the middle of a party that is definitely in full swing with a small plate of Hors d\u2019oeuvres in his hand. He\u2019s not quite sure where to begin or even how to begin.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan is by his side but it\u2019s been hard to really know what he\u2019s supposed to do in these situations when Dan is currently downing his third cocktail of the evening and Phil isn\u2019t even sure where his went.\u00a0</p><p>\tThere had to be over 300 people in Dan\u2019s house. It felt like people were packed like sardines inside the walls and Phil felt a bit overwhelmed. But at least this part was classy compared to the university parties that he used to go to as a student.\u00a0</p><p>\tThese people were all dressed in fine and fancy dresses and well groomed tuxes. They sipped Champagne and ate finger foods and mingled with everyone else. There was no crazy lights or music or really anything that would scream a crazy party to Phil.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it\u2019s just that these were all high profile celebrities and here was Phil, trying to find his way through the crowd to follow Dan, all the while trying to not spill his plate of food on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan tried to introduce him to some of his friends. Many of them he did recognize from TV shows and even other movies. But a lot of them he didn\u2019t know and he wanted to remain polite so he just nodded slowly and smiled as if he did know who they were.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut it was hard for him to navigate all of the people and to find people he actually felt like he could speak to. A lot of them weren\u2019t even the same social class as Phil and it was quite obvious in the way they held themselves in comparison to Phil who, frankly, had no fucking clue what he was doing.\u00a0</p><p>\tWithin a few hours, he was a bit exhausted already and he could tell Dan was as well. But everywhere Dan went, he went, and when he find himself getting too claustrophobic, he walked out the sliding glass doors onto the patio with the pool where less people were mingling.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe found a seat on a bench by the poolside and set down his plate and cursed himself for losing his actually really amazing cocktail. But it felt good to take a break away from everyone and not feel like he was fighting through the crowds.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s not even entirely sure where Dan went either.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil sits in silence all by himself as he eats the rest of his food and then gets out his cell phone to scroll through social media for a few. He\u2019s still scrolling through his phone when footsteps enter his thought and he looks up and sees Dan stood in front of him with two glasses in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hands one to Phil and then he takes a sip of his own before sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit much, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dan says, setting his glass onto the bench next to them. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit crazy actually when I look inside my own home and see everyone here. Like, I don\u2019t even know a quarter of these people.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is the party for?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan shrugs his shoulders. \u201cLiterally not even that sure to be honest. I think something to do with my film.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly and brings the rim of the glass up to his lips as he takes a drink and sets it down. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a party like this before.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI never had either prior to me actually becoming a well-known somebody.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThey\u2019re just so overwhelming. Funnily enough, you snagged this bench to break away which is the same bench I go to when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful view, sitting here.\u201d Phil comments, pointing out to the valley that you see just beyond Dan\u2019s fence surrounding his pool.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few perks of owning this house.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know quite what to say, so he brings up his glass and takes another sip of his drink. Dan beside him finishes off his own.</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve felt something for you since we saw each other for the first time in London.\u201d Dan suddenly says. \u201cAnd I feel like if I don\u2019t say anything now while I\u2019m a bit buzzed than I won\u2019t. But I just wanted you to know that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019ve liked you since we met.\u201d Phil admits. \u201cI knew it was more than just a silly crush when I couldn\u2019t ever get you out of my head. I thought about you all the time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAll the time?\u201d Dan asks, raising an eyebrow. Phil feels his cheeks flush and he reaches out to swat gently at Dan\u2019s arm.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI really like you, Phil.\u201d Dan says, turning his head to face him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels himself smile at the declaration before both them begin to lean in.\u00a0</p><p>\tTheir lips collide and Phil feels how perfectly they slot together, almost as if they were made for each other. Dan\u2019s hand comes up and his fingers weave through Phil\u2019s hair as he holds him close for the kiss.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels Dan\u2019s tongue swipe against his bottom lip and he opens his mouth to let Dan in as their kisses deepen. He feels his breath shorten and his hands move up on Dan\u2019s blazer, grabbing the lapels and pulling him closer.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was like fireworks going off in the distance. Dan\u2019s lips on Phil\u2019s felt perfect and natural. They were soft but also a bit dry but Phil didn\u2019t care. He pulled back from the kiss and looked at Dan, his lips red and swollen. He dove back forward and connected their lips again like their lives depended on it.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know how long they actually kissed for and frankly, he doesn\u2019t care. When he pulls back for the second time, he looks at Dan and just smiles and laughs and Dan does the same.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything feels spectacular and right. Phil can already feel the fondness for Dan climbing higher and higher the longer that they sit together on the bench. Dan intertwines their fingers and Phil hold his hand close to his body as they sit.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe party continued behind them as they spoke the rest of the night away. They stole a few more kisses before they headed back inside as the party began to fizzle and people began to leave.\u00a0</p><p>\tBy the end of the night, they were back in Dan\u2019s bed together and Phil held Dan close, pressing little kisses on Dan\u2019s hair as they fell asleep.\u00a0</p><p>\tEverything about this day was more than Phil could have ever asked for and he\u2019ll never forget it as long as he lives.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star.

It wasn&rsquo;t exactly the most fool proof and he was sure that something bad was bound to happen. For one: he had no idea what it even meant to arrive to an airport and have a private jet waiting for him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThat in itself was quite over whelming.&nbsp;</p><p>\tFor two: he had no idea how it even went to ride on a private jet. All he knew was that Dan&rsquo;s bodyguard and a few other people who neglected to introduce themselves were also on the same plane and he felt a bit&hellip;out of place. Especially so with his Adidas bag as his &lsquo;carry on&rsquo; luggage.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis brother Martyn was watching Spike for the week and Phil had dropped him off before running to the airport after being stuck in traffic. Dan had reassured him that he plane would not leave without him&#8213;contrary to every other commercial plane. But Phil still felt like he had to rush to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut it was an entirely different feeling stepping off from the plane and being in sunny Los Angeles with the warmth kissing his skin. He&rsquo;s escorted away to a private car by Joshua which should feel weird but Phil honestly finds it comforting knowing he had Dan&rsquo;s bodyguard to protect him from any weird paparazzi or people.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil gets into the back of the car and relaxes into the seat as the driver pulls away. He opens his phone and sends a text to Dan saying that he was here and on his way to his house&hellip;his house. Man, Phil didn&rsquo;t quite know what to expect knowing he was about to see Dan&rsquo;s house. Should he be nervous? Should he be excited? What is the proper reaction to seeing someone famous&rsquo;s house for the first time?&nbsp;</p><p>\tNothing is said by anyone in the car the entire time they&rsquo;re driving. If Phil wasn&rsquo;t so overwhelmed by the entire ordeal, he might have used some of his abilities to start small talk with the driver but instead, he&rsquo;s left speechless.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt doesn&rsquo;t take long for them to get to where they need to be and soon, Phil feels his breath leave his body as he gets to see what Los Angeles is beginning to look like&#8213;minus the heavy traffic that was currently holding them up.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe took some photos for himself to keep as a memory and he added a snapshot to his Instastory so that way he could brag to his friends back home where he was. He knew that they would all be waiting and watching over social media for anything that he may say or post.&nbsp;</p><p>\tNot to mention, he&rsquo;s sure his name is going to be on some news sites by the end of the evening anyway. He can imagine it now. DAN HOWELL&rsquo;S NEW BEAU ARRIVES IN LOS ANGELES or something like that. He feels a bit exasperated even at the thought of it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey crest up a steep hill and suddenly, they&rsquo;re heading towards bigger and bigger mansions and Phil feels his heart stop a bit in his throat. He knew that Dan&rsquo;s popularity and celebrity status would obviously mean that he would have a massive house but he was sure that the house they just passed was one of the Kardashian&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Excuse me&hellip;&rdquo; Phil found his voice ringing out in the dead silence of the car. The driver turned his head slightly in recognition of Phil getting his attention. &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;The Hollywood Hills.&rdquo; The driver answers calmly.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s house is up here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe driver nods. &ldquo;Mr. Howell&rsquo;s house is right up here. Just have to turn here and ring through the gate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil sat back and watched as the driver took a right turn and suddenly was confronted by a gate with a code on the side. The driver put in the code and the gates shuddered before they began to open slowly, allowing for the driver to pass through.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe drove down the straight road until they reached a semi-circle and the driver pulled around. In full view was Dan&rsquo;s home, sat back away from everything else. It was pristine white with a beautiful fountain in front of it. It wasn&rsquo;t nearly as big as all of those mansions that Phil had seen but it still blew his mind when the driver stepped out and opened his door for him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil grabbed his bag and stepped out onto the pavement of the driveway. He took in a deep breath and reached up, anxiously pushing his glasses further on his nose in a nervous habit. He began to walk forward, not even sure where to go in when he sees Dan, stood on the steps of his house with his arms crossed loosely over his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil had the overwhelming urge to run over and pick him up, squeezing him tight and just hugging him until they can&rsquo;t breathe. But he didn&rsquo;t. Instead, he tried to, as calmly as one could when they were shaking, walk over to Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan flashed his massive blinding smile at Phil and Phil flashed it back and suddenly, his bag was dropped to the ground as Dan wrapped his arms around him in a hug and held on tight. This was the first contact that they&rsquo;d ever had but Phil honestly wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s hug was genuine and warm and all Phil wanted to do was never let him go. He felt Dan&rsquo;s face press into his neck as his grip tightened for a moment and then loosed. Phil let go and Dan let go too and they just looked at each other.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil could kiss him. He really could and maybe he will?&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt would be so easy to lean in and just do it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe begins to lean in and Dan looks like he&rsquo;s going to lean in too but&hellip;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dan? Where did you go? We&rsquo;re not done going over what we&rsquo;re setting up for the party tonight!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tMarianne, Dan&rsquo;s manager, came rushing out the door after them and whatever moment they were sharing was gone just as fast as it had came.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan rolled his eyes and waved her off. &ldquo;Tell Jess and Morgan that I&rsquo;ll be back in a moment. Whatever they&rsquo;re setting up can&rsquo;t be that important anyway.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil furrowed his brows and when Dan turned back, he sensed the confusion that read on Phil&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m hosting a party tonight here at my house because apparently that&rsquo;s what I have to do and my team are just busy setting up the decorations and everything else now. The caterer and the musicians will be around a bit later and this is all a bit of a hectic day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan laughed nervously and Phil nodded because he really just wanted to spend the day with Dan. He wanted to be alone with Dan and just&hellip;he just wanted to be with Dan. No one else. Just him and Dan, cuddling or doing something more in Dan&rsquo;s bed as they indulged in lost time.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil really wanted to ask Dan on a date&hellip;and even better, maybe ask Dan if he&rsquo;d like to be his boyfriend. But that&rsquo;s a bit hard if Dan&rsquo;s going to have hoards of people over tonight for a party.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; Dan repeats. &ldquo;The timing was just pretty shit if I&rsquo;m being honest but they wouldn&rsquo;t really budge for the date since invitations went out for it like three weeks ago. I promise that the rest of the time you&rsquo;re here, there will be no one else around. It&rsquo;ll be just us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods and forces a smile to Dan who just smiles back gently.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Dan continues.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad I&rsquo;m here too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you want something to eat? Or would you like a place to rest for a bit? I know how jet lag is so I can show you my room and you can take a little nap?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nodded because he would love to take a nap for a few hours to try and catch up on sleep. He would absolutely love to just lay down in the plush comforter and pillows that he sees every time Dan Skype&rsquo;s him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan motions him inside and Phil follows him, immediately feeling his breath hitch at the sight of the inside of Dan&rsquo;s home. There is a grand staircase front and center when you walk in, and behind that, Phil can see an open area with what looks to be a TV and a living room set up. And in the distance, just past the windows, he can see a pool overlooking the valley.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan takes him up the stairs and Phil follows as they head towards Dan&rsquo;s bedroom. Dan pushes the door open and when Phil walks inside, his jaw drops. A massive king bed took up majority of the wall but that didn&rsquo;t account for the rest of the stunning decor that laid around the room and on the walls.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis bed was covered in a black grey duvet with big fluffy pillows and an ottoman in the front held a brand new sparkling suit and a pair of shoes&#8213;obviously for the party. Phil walks in further and looks out the left side, seeing a balcony with sliding glass doors and those billowy white curtains that Phil always thought looked cliche in romance novels.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of a mess.&rdquo; Dan says, rubbing his neck. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t really had the motivation to clean it up or anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dan, this is stunning.&rdquo; Phil says, turning around and dropping his bag. &ldquo;Everything about your house is just stunning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan bites his lip and flashes red. &ldquo;I personally think it&rsquo;s a bit much but&hellip;it&rsquo;s nice every once and a while to indulge in the perks, I guess?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil walks over to the bed, his feet carrying himself before he can even comprehend where he&rsquo;s going. He presses his hand on the duvet and pushes down, feeling the feathery weight under his hand. He takes a seat and toes off his sneakers, hoping Dan won&rsquo;t mind, and feels himself sink into the mattress.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;re in heaven, mate.&rdquo; Dan says with a laugh. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re welcome to sleep here for a little bit. I have to go back downstairs to make sure Marianne and the team aren&rsquo;t fucking anything up but I&rsquo;ll come up and wake you up if you start sleeping too long.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods and turns to him. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nods back and smiles before he turns on his heels and leaves the room, shutting the door behind him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil lays down on the bed and feels his body sink into it. He closes his eyes, taking off his glasses and setting them to the side, and just relaxes into it. He could get used to being here, sharing this bed with Dan.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tHe doesn&rsquo;t know how long he sleeps for, or really know even when he falls asleep. But when he wakes up, Dan is laying beside him in bed, his own eyes shut in a peaceful slumber.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil gets the urge to reach over and stroke a stray piece of his hair off from his eyes. But he doesn&rsquo;t. He just watches as Dan&rsquo;s face crinkles up a bit in his sleep and then relaxes. He finds himself rolling closer, wanting to experience what it&rsquo;s like to cuddle with Dan&#8213;and especially one who is sleepy.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe reaches out and arm and puts his hand on Dan&rsquo;s side, feeling the warmth travel through his touch. Dan stirs and Phil jumps, immediately thinking that his was a mistake and he&rsquo;s breached some line that he shouldn&rsquo;t have. But instead, Dan&rsquo;s eyes open just a little bit and he smiles gently at Phil before he throws his arm over Phil&rsquo;s chest and scooches forward.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s head comes to rest on Phil&rsquo;s chest and Dan&rsquo;s body is practically covering Phil&rsquo;s at this point, but he doesn&rsquo;t care in the slightest. Dan&rsquo;s weight and warmth is grounding for him and he wraps his arms around him, holding him just the way he wanted to, and lets his eyes drift back off into sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen he wakes up again, Dan is sat on the edge of the bed, stretching his arms up and then reaching down to unwrinkle his shirt that had gotten wrinkled as they slept. Dan scratches his side and then turns his head and his lips curl up in a smile as he sees Phil awake.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hey, didn&rsquo;t mean to wake you up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Is it okay that we cuddled?&rdquo; Dan asked, his voice getting a bit more airy and serious. &ldquo;Because I know I can get a bit clingy when I sleep but I didn&rsquo;t want to cross any lines.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil quickly shook his head. &ldquo;I really loved cuddling with you actually.&rdquo; He smiles wider. &ldquo;I really would like to do more of that actually.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan laughs and lets out a snort as he stands up. &ldquo;Maybe later. But my party begins in a few hours and I need to get ready and I&rsquo;m assuming you will have to too. And I also want to eat something before it begins as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods and begins to sit up, putting his glasses on as he swings his legs out to the edge of the bed and begins to stand on wobbly limbs. He&rsquo;s still a bit jet-lagged, nowhere near as bad as he was before.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s about to walk to his bag and pull out some clothes when he&rsquo;s hit with the sudden realization that he did not pack anything for a party. Nothing he brought would be suitable for Dan&rsquo;s party.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have anything to wear.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan looks up from where he&rsquo;s stood at the end of his ottoman. &ldquo;You can just borrow something of mine?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThat is how two hours later, Phil ends up in the middle of a party that is definitely in full swing with a small plate of Hors d&rsquo;oeuvres in his hand. He&rsquo;s not quite sure where to begin or even how to begin.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan is by his side but it&rsquo;s been hard to really know what he&rsquo;s supposed to do in these situations when Dan is currently downing his third cocktail of the evening and Phil isn&rsquo;t even sure where his went.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThere had to be over 300 people in Dan&rsquo;s house. It felt like people were packed like sardines inside the walls and Phil felt a bit overwhelmed. But at least this part was classy compared to the university parties that he used to go to as a student.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThese people were all dressed in fine and fancy dresses and well groomed tuxes. They sipped Champagne and ate finger foods and mingled with everyone else. There was no crazy lights or music or really anything that would scream a crazy party to Phil.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut it&rsquo;s just that these were all high profile celebrities and here was Phil, trying to find his way through the crowd to follow Dan, all the while trying to not spill his plate of food on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan tried to introduce him to some of his friends. Many of them he did recognize from TV shows and even other movies. But a lot of them he didn&rsquo;t know and he wanted to remain polite so he just nodded slowly and smiled as if he did know who they were.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut it was hard for him to navigate all of the people and to find people he actually felt like he could speak to. A lot of them weren&rsquo;t even the same social class as Phil and it was quite obvious in the way they held themselves in comparison to Phil who, frankly, had no fucking clue what he was doing.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWithin a few hours, he was a bit exhausted already and he could tell Dan was as well. But everywhere Dan went, he went, and when he find himself getting too claustrophobic, he walked out the sliding glass doors onto the patio with the pool where less people were mingling.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe found a seat on a bench by the poolside and set down his plate and cursed himself for losing his actually really amazing cocktail. But it felt good to take a break away from everyone and not feel like he was fighting through the crowds.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s not even entirely sure where Dan went either.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil sits in silence all by himself as he eats the rest of his food and then gets out his cell phone to scroll through social media for a few. He&rsquo;s still scrolling through his phone when footsteps enter his thought and he looks up and sees Dan stood in front of him with two glasses in his hands.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe hands one to Phil and then he takes a sip of his own before sitting down.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a bit much, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Dan says, setting his glass onto the bench next to them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a bit crazy actually when I look inside my own home and see everyone here. Like, I don&rsquo;t even know a quarter of these people.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What is the party for?&rdquo; Phil asks.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan shrugs his shoulders. &ldquo;Literally not even that sure to be honest. I think something to do with my film.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods slowly and brings the rim of the glass up to his lips as he takes a drink and sets it down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been to a party like this before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I never had either prior to me actually becoming a well-known somebody.&rdquo; He pauses. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just so overwhelming. Funnily enough, you snagged this bench to break away which is the same bench I go to when I&rsquo;m feeling overwhelmed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful view, sitting here.&rdquo; Phil comments, pointing out to the valley that you see just beyond Dan&rsquo;s fence surrounding his pool.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nods. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the few perks of owning this house.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t know quite what to say, so he brings up his glass and takes another sip of his drink. Dan beside him finishes off his own.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt something for you since we saw each other for the first time in London.&rdquo; Dan suddenly says. &ldquo;And I feel like if I don&rsquo;t say anything now while I&rsquo;m a bit buzzed than I won&rsquo;t. But I just wanted you to know that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve liked you since we met.&rdquo; Phil admits. &ldquo;I knew it was more than just a silly crush when I couldn&rsquo;t ever get you out of my head. I thought about you all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;All the time?&rdquo; Dan asks, raising an eyebrow. Phil feels his cheeks flush and he reaches out to swat gently at Dan&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I really like you, Phil.&rdquo; Dan says, turning his head to face him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels himself smile at the declaration before both them begin to lean in.&nbsp;</p><p>\tTheir lips collide and Phil feels how perfectly they slot together, almost as if they were made for each other. Dan&rsquo;s hand comes up and his fingers weave through Phil&rsquo;s hair as he holds him close for the kiss.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels Dan&rsquo;s tongue swipe against his bottom lip and he opens his mouth to let Dan in as their kisses deepen. He feels his breath shorten and his hands move up on Dan&rsquo;s blazer, grabbing the lapels and pulling him closer.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt was like fireworks going off in the distance. Dan&rsquo;s lips on Phil&rsquo;s felt perfect and natural. They were soft but also a bit dry but Phil didn&rsquo;t care. He pulled back from the kiss and looked at Dan, his lips red and swollen. He dove back forward and connected their lips again like their lives depended on it.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe doesn&rsquo;t know how long they actually kissed for and frankly, he doesn&rsquo;t care. When he pulls back for the second time, he looks at Dan and just smiles and laughs and Dan does the same.&nbsp;</p><p>\tEverything feels spectacular and right. Phil can already feel the fondness for Dan climbing higher and higher the longer that they sit together on the bench. Dan intertwines their fingers and Phil hold his hand close to his body as they sit.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe party continued behind them as they spoke the rest of the night away. They stole a few more kisses before they headed back inside as the party began to fizzle and people began to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBy the end of the night, they were back in Dan&rsquo;s bed together and Phil held Dan close, pressing little kisses on Dan&rsquo;s hair as they fell asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>\tEverything about this day was more than Phil could have ever asked for and he&rsquo;ll never forget it as long as he lives.&nbsp;</p>",
