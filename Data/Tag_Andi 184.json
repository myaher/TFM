        "body": "<p>I wrote about my opinions on the TJ/Jonah flashback-feud last night on a reblog of someone else&rsquo;s post, but I&rsquo;m going to talk about it again here so it can be in the tag &amp; I can go more in-depth.</p><p>There is a lot of debate as to whether or not a &ldquo;longtime rift&rdquo; between TJ and Jonah would make sense on the show, because when they interacted during season 2, they seemed to be fine with each other. It is my belief that the addition of this rift will not be a continuity error IF it is written correctly.</p><p>There have been a total of four (now five) times that TJ and Jonah have acknowledged each other throughout the series:</p><ol><li>TJ finds Jonah having a panic attack during Cyrus&rsquo; Bar Mitzvah, and leaves to find help.<br/></li><li>When Cyrus leaves to check on TJ during Buffy&rsquo;s basketball game, Jonah is confused and asks Andi, &ldquo;Are they friends?&rdquo;<br/></li><li>Jonah gets the entire basketball team to sign a ball for Buffy, including TJ (off screen)<br/></li><li>Jonah shows up to the spoon with one of his friends, and they sit down with Andi, Cyrus, and TJ - who all leave shortly after.<br/></li><li>TJ shows up while Cyrus and Jonah are playing ping pong, and Jonah becomes uncomfortable/irritated by TJ&rsquo;s presence and storms off.<br/></li></ol><p>And here&rsquo;s the thing - I don&rsquo;t think any of these moments necessarily disprove the existence of a long-term rift between the two&hellip; because one thing is clear in every scenario: this is a one sided feud. In a rare twist of emotions - Jonah is the one who is upset, and TJ is the one who is oblivious to his feelings.</p><p>So let\u2019s analyze each of the above TJ/Jonah moments, and how they can still make sense with the\u00a0\u201clong time rift\u201d and flashback sequences coming up in the new episode.</p><p><b>THE PANIC ATTACK</b></p><p>The first thing that is important to note is what triggered Jonah\u2019s panic attack: a fear of abandonment. We know this is one of his triggers based on the scenes we have seen involving his anxiety:\u00a0<br/></p><ol><li>His first panic attack is triggered by Andi no longer wanting to date him, and instead having fun with another guy.\u00a0<br/></li><li>When TJ finds him during the panic attack, Jonah begs him not to leave him alone.\u00a0<br/></li><li>Jonah tells Andi that he wants her to be his girlfriend in a desperate attempt to stop himself from having anymore panic attacks<br/></li><li>Jonah finds out that Andi is still talking to Walker, which triggers his second panic attack and ultimately leads to him seeking comfort in Bowie and in music.<br/></li><li>Jonah is stressed during the fundraiser, and walks in during Jonah and Buffy fighting (which was coincidentally caused by TJ). Jonah panics, but does not have a full blown-panic attack.</li></ol><p>It\u2019s easy to look at most of these scenes and assume that Jonah\u2019s anxiety is triggered by Andi, but anyone who struggles with a panic disorder is aware that it\u2019s usually something deeper than that. For Jonah, it\u2019s pretty clear that a fear of abandonment or being alone is a part of that deeper trigger. This is not only supported by all of the examples above, but also his need to continue dating girls even if he doesn\u2019t actually like dating, or if they mistreat him.</p><p>The second thing that is important to note is how Jonah\u2019s first panic attack actually played out. Jonah\u2019s vision gets blurry, he\u2019s short of breath, he sits down, and starts to scream for help. TJ hears him ask for help and screams out\u00a0\u201cJonah!\u201d. He swiftly runs to where Jonah is sitting, looks him in the eyes, and says\u00a0\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>This part of the interaction confirms that these two characters already know each other, which is interesting because the show never made a point to let us in on this before despite the fact that TJ was already on TGHC\u2019s radar for awhile by this point. I think when this aired, a lot of people may have even seen that interaction as a continuity error, but it may actually have been a set-up to the current storyline which will bring it full circle.</p><p>When TJ says that he\u2019s going to leave to get help, Jonah is terrified and asks him not to leave. This supports the anxiety about abandonment theory in a more physical way, compared to his other moments of panic which are usually triggered by emotional abandonment. This is also the most interesting part because while it\u2019s easy to say that Jonah was just in fear for his life and would have been desperate for literally anybody to help him, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s entirely true. TJ is a familiar face to him, which he finds comfort in - but because they are not necessarily friends at this point, Jonah wants HIM in particular to help him because he doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing him. If it had been Andi or Cyrus or Buffy who found him, he likely would have been embarrassed and afraid of losing them and likely would have WANTED them to leave, like he mentioned to Cyrus\u2019 father in that episode. But because it was TJ, there wasn\u2019t that added amount of pressure.\u00a0</p><p>The third thing that is important to note about this situation is that TJ never tells Cyrus or anyone else about finding Jonah. Between the genuine concern TJ shows for Jonah, and the fact that he kept this a secret without being asked to leads me to believe that TJ did this out of respect. We never saw these two acknowledge that moment again, which is interesting as well&hellip; but I theorize that because Jonah was so freaked about being abandoned, TJ put a bad taste in his mouth but Jonah still couldn\u2019t tell anyone about it without exposing his own issues.\u00a0</p><p><b>BASKETBALL GAME</b></p><p>The next time that Jonah acknowledges TJ is during Buffy\u2019s basketball game. Cyrus notices that TJ isn\u2019t in the game and looks upset, so he leaves Andi and Jonah to go check on him. Jonah looks confused and asks Andi if they are friends. Again, out of context, this scene doesn\u2019t make much sense or isn\u2019t something that anyone would really look into.\u00a0</p><p>Most of us were so focused on the relationship forming between Cyrus and TJ, that we paid very little attention to what Jonah\u2019s line here meant. Those who did focus on that moment did it through a Jyrus lens - assuming that Jonah was jealous because of his secret romantic feelings for Cyrus. But that\u2019s only half-true. What Jonah feels is not romantic, but platonic jealously and confusion.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You see, by this point Jonah has been reminded of whatever happened between him and TJ during their childhood AND he has a subtle negative feeling towards TJ because of a combination of that, hearing Buffy and Andi shit-talk him, and being left alone during his panic attack. At this point, whatever grudge he is harboring from childhood feels silly, and his anxiety disorder is still too embarrassing to tell his friends about - so he never explains his confusion or concern about this new friendship.\u00a0</p><p>But what happens here in a literal sense is also symbolic of the subtext happening involving Jonah\u2019s anxiety: Cyrus is leaving his friend for TJ, someone who Jonah does not trust. Not only does Cyrus physically stand up and walk away from his friends to be with TJ - but this is the first sign of Jonah feeling like he could be losing his only guy friend to TJ.\u00a0</p><p><b>BASKETBALL SIGNING</b></p><p>The third interaction between Jonah and TJ actually happens off-screen, and that is when Jonah gets the entire basketball team to sign a ball for Buffy\u2019s time capsule. This is the moment most people are using to prove that Jonah and TJ are\u00a0\u201cfine\u201d with each other, and to say that the\u00a0\u201clong time rift\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>I disagree, as this happened off-screen and we really don\u2019t know how this event played out. For all we know, Jonah could have given the ball to the coach or a friend on the team and had them pass it around. But even if Jonah did physically communicate with TJ to get it signed, he was doing it as a favor for one of his best friends. Sometimes people swallow their pride and pretend things are fine. I don\u2019t like reading into this interaction since we literally didn\u2019t see it.</p><p><b>THE SPOON</b></p><p>The fourth interaction between Jonah and TJ happens at The Spoon. TJ approaches Andi and Cyrus at their booth, where he apologizes to Time-Capsule-Buffy. Shortly after he sits down at the booth, Jonah shows up with plans to meet up with his friend Natalie for lunch. Jonah and Natalie sit down at Andi\u2019s booth with Cyrus and TJ.\u00a0</p><p>We do not see Jonah and TJ even look at each other in this scene. As soon as Jonah sits down, Andi becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Immediately after Andi walks out, TJ says he has to go to work and asks if Cyrus would like to tag along to which Cyrus desperately replies\u00a0\u201cYes, PLEASE\u201d. Jonah is left with Natalie, and looks as if he is disappointed and unsure of what to do next.</p><p>Just like the previous scenes, out of context, this doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal. But when combined with the earlier interactions and what we know is coming next, I think this scene is a big turning point. Think about it&hellip;</p><p>This is the second time out of a total of 4 interactions in which TJ has quickly found a reason to leave Jonah. As the audience, we are aware that TJ was not in the wrong in either of these moments. But Jonah\u2019s anxiety triggered by abandonment could easily make him feel insecure over this.</p><p>This is also the second out of a total of 4 interactions in which Cyrus has physically left Jonah to be with TJ. On top of that, this time Cyrus seemed EXCITED to get away from Jonah and be with TJ. We usually see this through our shipping lenses, but it\u2019s not a reach to see why Jonah could be platonically jealous and insecure about this happening.</p><p><b>PING PONG/THE FLASHBACKS</b></p><p>So here\u2019s what we know about the upcoming episode:</p><p>Jonah is over at Cyrus\u2019 house playing ping pong and having a good time, when TJ shows up without warning. Jonah becomes immediately uncomfortable and tries to leave as Cyrus and TJ greet each other. Cyrus tries to find out what happened, Jonah implies that it\u2019s TJ\u2019s fault, and TJ looks completely oblivious to the situation at hand.\u00a0</p><p>Because of the episode description, we know that Cyrus will be mending a long-time rift between Jonah and TJ. Because of casting calls and spoilers from Asher, we know that we will be seeing flashbacks of TJ and Jonah as children, to show what caused this rift.\u00a0</p><p>So here\u2019s my complete theory/timeline of events:</p><ol><li>TJ and Jonah met as children through baseball. They were either on opposing teams or on the same team. TJ did something that hurt Jonah, either emotionally or physically. It was either an accident, or another example of TJ being mean prior to knowing Cyrus.\u00a0<br/></li><li>Whatever caused the rift wasn\u2019t anything too serious. TJ probably has not thought about it in years, if at all since it actually happened. Like I said before, this feud is entirely one-sided. TJ has absolutely no grudge or negative feelings towards Jonah, and appears to want to befriend him just as much as he has with Buffy and Andi because he knows that he is a good friend to Cyrus.\u00a0<br/></li><li>Whatever caused the rift was also mostly forgotten by Jonah over the years. Although the feud is one-sided, I don\u2019t believe it was constantly festering over the years. Whether it was a misunderstanding or an accident or an example of him being bullied or injured at the hands of TJ, it wasn\u2019t something that Jonah has thought about every day since then. He had pushed it out of his mind and moved on with life, and it wasn\u2019t until recent events that he opened these old wounds.<br/></li><li>When TJ found Jonah having a panic attack, he was genuinely worried about him and Jonah was genuinely happy to see a familiar face. But when TJ left and got an adult, despite Jonah asking him not to - it left a bad taste in Jonah\u2019s mouth. He couldn\u2019t tell anyone about it without exposing his own issues, but it definitely made him think about his past interactions with TJ for the first time in years.<br/></li><li>Fast forward to Andi, Cyrus, and Jonah on the bleachers to watch Buffy play basketball. Cyrus leaves to check on TJ, and Jonah looks confused by their friendship. By this point he has replayed his childhood rift with TJ, the moment at the Bar Mitzvah, and likely the negative things Andi &amp; Buffy have had to say about TJ on repeat in his head several times. He is uncomfortable with the idea of one of his best friends becoming close with someone who, in Jonah\u2019s eyes, can\u2019t be trusted.\u00a0</li><li>Jonah swallows his discomfort to get a basketball signed for one of his best friends. TJ shows signs of becoming a better person by swallowing his pride to sign the ball for Buffy. This moment is not about the relationship between Jonah and TJ, but rather each of their internal journeys and their friendship with Buffy and TGHC.</li><li>TJ and Cyrus leave shortly after Jonah arrives at The Spoon. As the audience, we know that this moment has nothing to do with the character\u2019s feelings towards Jonah. But Jonah doesn\u2019t see the full story like we do. He feels like there is distance between himself and his only true friends. He and Andi have let their romantic relationship ruin their platonic friendship. Buffy has moved without saying goodbye, and nobody has heard from her. And now Cyrus keeps leaving him to hang out with TJ instead. Given his history of anxiety and fear of being alone, it\u2019s easy to see how Jonah would misread all of these events and find a way to blame TJ for these things, even though TJ hasn\u2019t done anything wrong (recently).</li><li>Jonah finally gets to hang out with Cyrus, for the first time in a long time. We have only seen these two hang out one-on-one a handful of times: when they go to a sporting event together on what was originally planned to be a double date, when they skateboard together and Cyrus ends up in the hospital, when they film the freshmen orientation video together and Cyrus has a panic attack, when they go shopping for a Bar Mitzvah suit together, and when Cyrus comforts Jonah after he fails to make it on the ultimate frisbee team.\u00a0<br/><br/>This means that the ping-pong hang is one of the first times Jonah and Cyrus have hung out just the two of them since before Cyrus\u2019 Bar Mitzvah. As this line of events plays out, we see most of it through Cyrus\u2019 point of view and give little consideration to what Jonah feels during it. We see it through the lens of Cyrus\u2019 crush on Jonah fading into a platonic friendship. We fail to realize that Cyrus + Jonah have barely had any ~ bro time ~ since before Cyrus became friends with TJ, and before Jonah discovered his anxiety disorder.\u00a0</li></ol><p>It makes perfect sense that Jonah would feel anxious over TJ once again coming in and crashing his time with Cyrus. He fears being alone, and losing his friends. And because of whatever petty trauma he has from childhood involving TJ, it\u2019s very easy for him to blame TJ for everything he is feeling instead of addressing his own internal conflicts and anxiety. Whatever the rift is, it will be resolved within this episode and allow space for all of the characters to grow as friends before the season 3 finale.</p><p>In conclusion: This episode still opens a big opportunity to talk more about Jonah\u2019s anxiety, as well as set up some more Tyrus subtext. If it was written correctly, there is no reason to assume it will mess up any continuity. I\u2019m not sure the result will align with this analysis, but to decide now that the plot is stupid or unplanned or whatever seems silly to me, as all of these past events line up perfectly as subtext for Jonah\u2019s anxiety arc. The end.</p>",

            "comment": "<p>I wrote about my opinions on the TJ/Jonah flashback-feud last night on a reblog of someone else\u2019s post, but I\u2019m going to talk about it again here so it can be in the tag &amp; I can go more in-depth.</p><p>There is a lot of debate as to whether or not a \u201clongtime rift\u201d between TJ and Jonah would make sense on the show, because when they interacted during season 2, they seemed to be fine with each other.

In a rare twist of emotions - Jonah is the one who is upset, and TJ is the one who is oblivious to his feelings.</p><p>So let\u2019s analyze each of the above TJ/Jonah moments, and how they can still make sense with the\u00a0\u201clong time rift\u201d and flashback sequences coming up in the new episode.</p><p><b>THE PANIC ATTACK</b></p><p>The first thing that is important to note is what triggered Jonah\u2019s panic attack: a fear of abandonment. We know this is one of his triggers based on the scenes we have seen involving his anxiety:\u00a0<br></p><ol><li>His first panic attack is triggered by Andi no longer wanting to date him, and instead having fun with another guy.\u00a0<br></li><li>When TJ finds him during the panic attack, Jonah begs him not to leave him alone.\u00a0<br></li><li>Jonah tells Andi that he wants her to be his girlfriend in a desperate attempt to stop himself from having anymore panic attacks<br></li><li>Jonah finds out that Andi is still talking to Walker, which triggers his second panic attack and ultimately leads to him seeking comfort in Bowie and in music.<br></li><li>Jonah is stressed during the fundraiser, and walks in during Jonah and Buffy fighting (which was coincidentally caused by TJ). Jonah panics, but does not have a full blown-panic attack.</li></ol><p>It\u2019s easy to look at most of these scenes and assume that Jonah\u2019s anxiety is triggered by Andi, but anyone who struggles with a panic disorder is aware that it\u2019s usually something deeper than that. For Jonah, it\u2019s pretty clear that a fear of abandonment or being alone is a part of that deeper trigger. This is not only supported by all of the examples above, but also his need to continue dating girls even if he doesn\u2019t actually like dating, or if they mistreat him.</p><p>The second thing that is important to note is how Jonah\u2019s first panic attack actually played out. Jonah\u2019s vision gets blurry, he\u2019s short of breath, he sits down, and starts to scream for help. TJ hears him ask for help and screams out\u00a0\u201cJonah!\u201d. He swiftly runs to where Jonah is sitting, looks him in the eyes, and says\u00a0\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>This part of the interaction confirms that these two characters already know each other, which is interesting because the show never made a point to let us in on this before despite the fact that TJ was already on TGHC\u2019s radar for awhile by this point. I think when this aired, a lot of people may have even seen that interaction as a continuity error, but it may actually have been a set-up to the current storyline which will bring it full circle.</p><p>When TJ says that he\u2019s going to leave to get help, Jonah is terrified and asks him not to leave. This supports the anxiety about abandonment theory in a more physical way, compared to his other moments of panic which are usually triggered by emotional abandonment. This is also the most interesting part because while it\u2019s easy to say that Jonah was just in fear for his life and would have been desperate for literally anybody to help him, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s entirely true. TJ is a familiar face to him, which he finds comfort in - but because they are not necessarily friends at this point, Jonah wants HIM in particular to help him because he doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing him. If it had been Andi or Cyrus or Buffy who found him, he likely would have been embarrassed and afraid of losing them and likely would have WANTED them to leave, like he mentioned to Cyrus\u2019 father in that episode. But because it was TJ, there wasn\u2019t that added amount of pressure.\u00a0</p><p>The third thing that is important to note about this situation is that TJ never tells Cyrus or anyone else about finding Jonah. Between the genuine concern TJ shows for Jonah, and the fact that he kept this a secret without being asked to leads me to believe that TJ did this out of respect. We never saw these two acknowledge that moment again, which is interesting as well\u2026 but I theorize that because Jonah was so freaked about being abandoned, TJ put a bad taste in his mouth but Jonah still couldn\u2019t tell anyone about it without exposing his own issues.\u00a0</p><p><b>BASKETBALL GAME</b></p><p>The next time that Jonah acknowledges TJ is during Buffy\u2019s basketball game. Cyrus notices that TJ isn\u2019t in the game and looks upset, so he leaves Andi and Jonah to go check on him. Jonah looks confused and asks Andi if they are friends. Again, out of context, this scene doesn\u2019t make much sense or isn\u2019t something that anyone would really look into.\u00a0</p><p>Most of us were so focused on the relationship forming between Cyrus and TJ, that we paid very little attention to what Jonah\u2019s line here meant. Those who did focus on that moment did it through a Jyrus lens - assuming that Jonah was jealous because of his secret romantic feelings for Cyrus. But that\u2019s only half-true. What Jonah feels is not romantic, but platonic jealously and confusion.\u00a0<br></p><p>You see, by this point Jonah has been reminded of whatever happened between him and TJ during their childhood AND he has a subtle negative feeling towards TJ because of a combination of that, hearing Buffy and Andi shit-talk him, and being left alone during his panic attack. At this point, whatever grudge he is harboring from childhood feels silly, and his anxiety disorder is still too embarrassing to tell his friends about - so he never explains his confusion or concern about this new friendship.\u00a0</p><p>But what happens here in a literal sense is also symbolic of the subtext happening involving Jonah\u2019s anxiety: Cyrus is leaving his friend for TJ, someone who Jonah does not trust. Not only does Cyrus physically stand up and walk away from his friends to be with TJ - but this is the first sign of Jonah feeling like he could be losing his only guy friend to TJ.\u00a0</p><p><b>BASKETBALL SIGNING</b></p><p>The third interaction between Jonah and TJ actually happens off-screen, and that is when Jonah gets the entire basketball team to sign a ball for Buffy\u2019s time capsule. This is the moment most people are using to prove that Jonah and TJ are\u00a0\u201cfine\u201d with each other, and to say that the\u00a0\u201clong time rift\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>I disagree, as this happened off-screen and we really don\u2019t know how this event played out. For all we know, Jonah could have given the ball to the coach or a friend on the team and had them pass it around. But even if Jonah did physically communicate with TJ to get it signed, he was doing it as a favor for one of his best friends. Sometimes people swallow their pride and pretend things are fine. I don\u2019t like reading into this interaction since we literally didn\u2019t see it.</p><p><b>THE SPOON</b></p><p>The fourth interaction between Jonah and TJ happens at The Spoon. TJ approaches Andi and Cyrus at their booth, where he apologizes to Time-Capsule-Buffy. Shortly after he sits down at the booth, Jonah shows up with plans to meet up with his friend Natalie for lunch. Jonah and Natalie sit down at Andi\u2019s booth with Cyrus and TJ.\u00a0</p><p>We do not see Jonah and TJ even look at each other in this scene. As soon as Jonah sits down, Andi becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Immediately after Andi walks out, TJ says he has to go to work and asks if Cyrus would like to tag along to which Cyrus desperately replies\u00a0\u201cYes, PLEASE\u201d.

But when combined with the earlier interactions and what we know is coming next, I think this scene is a big turning point.

We know this is one of his triggers based on the scenes we have seen involving his anxiety:\u00a0<br></p><ol><li>His first panic attack is triggered by Andi no longer wanting to date him, and instead having fun with another guy.\u00a0<br></li><li>When TJ finds him during the panic attack, Jonah begs him not to leave him alone.\u00a0<br></li><li>Jonah tells Andi that he wants her to be his girlfriend in a desperate attempt to stop himself from having anymore panic attacks<br></li><li>Jonah finds out that Andi is still talking to Walker, which triggers his second panic attack and ultimately leads to him seeking comfort in Bowie and in music.<br></li><li>Jonah is stressed during the fundraiser, and walks in during Jonah and Buffy fighting (which was coincidentally caused by TJ). Jonah panics, but does not have a full blown-panic attack.</li></ol><p>It\u2019s easy to look at most of these scenes and assume that Jonah\u2019s anxiety is triggered by Andi, but anyone who struggles with a panic disorder is aware that it\u2019s usually something deeper than that. For Jonah, it\u2019s pretty clear that a fear of abandonment or being alone is a part of that deeper trigger. This is not only supported by all of the examples above, but also his need to continue dating girls even if he doesn\u2019t actually like dating, or if they mistreat him.</p><p>The second thing that is important to note is how Jonah\u2019s first panic attack actually played out. Jonah\u2019s vision gets blurry, he\u2019s short of breath, he sits down, and starts to scream for help. TJ hears him ask for help and screams out\u00a0\u201cJonah!\u201d. He swiftly runs to where Jonah is sitting, looks him in the eyes, and says\u00a0\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>This part of the interaction confirms that these two characters already know each other, which is interesting because the show never made a point to let us in on this before despite the fact that TJ was already on TGHC\u2019s radar for awhile by this point. I think when this aired, a lot of people may have even seen that interaction as a continuity error, but it may actually have been a set-up to the current storyline which will bring it full circle.</p><p>When TJ says that he\u2019s going to leave to get help, Jonah is terrified and asks him not to leave. This supports the anxiety about abandonment theory in a more physical way, compared to his other moments of panic which are usually triggered by emotional abandonment. This is also the most interesting part because while it\u2019s easy to say that Jonah was just in fear for his life and would have been desperate for literally anybody to help him, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s entirely true. TJ is a familiar face to him, which he finds comfort in - but because they are not necessarily friends at this point, Jonah wants HIM in particular to help him because he doesn\u2019t have to worry about losing him. If it had been Andi or Cyrus or Buffy who found him, he likely would have been embarrassed and afraid of losing them and likely would have WANTED them to leave, like he mentioned to Cyrus\u2019 father in that episode. But because it was TJ, there wasn\u2019t that added amount of pressure.\u00a0</p><p>The third thing that is important to note about this situation is that TJ never tells Cyrus or anyone else about finding Jonah. Between the genuine concern TJ shows for Jonah, and the fact that he kept this a secret without being asked to leads me to believe that TJ did this out of respect. We never saw these two acknowledge that moment again, which is interesting as well\u2026 but I theorize that because Jonah was so freaked about being abandoned, TJ put a bad taste in his mouth but Jonah still couldn\u2019t tell anyone about it without exposing his own issues.\u00a0</p><p><b>BASKETBALL GAME</b></p><p>The next time that Jonah acknowledges TJ is during Buffy\u2019s basketball game. Cyrus notices that TJ isn\u2019t in the game and looks upset, so he leaves Andi and Jonah to go check on him. Jonah looks confused and asks Andi if they are friends. Again, out of context, this scene doesn\u2019t make much sense or isn\u2019t something that anyone would really look into.\u00a0</p><p>Most of us were so focused on the relationship forming between Cyrus and TJ, that we paid very little attention to what Jonah\u2019s line here meant. Those who did focus on that moment did it through a Jyrus lens - assuming that Jonah was jealous because of his secret romantic feelings for Cyrus. But that\u2019s only half-true. What Jonah feels is not romantic, but platonic jealously and confusion.\u00a0<br></p><p>You see, by this point Jonah has been reminded of whatever happened between him and TJ during their childhood AND he has a subtle negative feeling towards TJ because of a combination of that, hearing Buffy and Andi shit-talk him, and being left alone during his panic attack. At this point, whatever grudge he is harboring from childhood feels silly, and his anxiety disorder is still too embarrassing to tell his friends about - so he never explains his confusion or concern about this new friendship.\u00a0</p><p>But what happens here in a literal sense is also symbolic of the subtext happening involving Jonah\u2019s anxiety: Cyrus is leaving his friend for TJ, someone who Jonah does not trust. Not only does Cyrus physically stand up and walk away from his friends to be with TJ - but this is the first sign of Jonah feeling like he could be losing his only guy friend to TJ.\u00a0</p><p><b>BASKETBALL SIGNING</b></p><p>The third interaction between Jonah and TJ actually happens off-screen, and that is when Jonah gets the entire basketball team to sign a ball for Buffy\u2019s time capsule. This is the moment most people are using to prove that Jonah and TJ are\u00a0\u201cfine\u201d with each other, and to say that the\u00a0\u201clong time rift\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>I disagree, as this happened off-screen and we really don\u2019t know how this event played out. For all we know, Jonah could have given the ball to the coach or a friend on the team and had them pass it around. But even if Jonah did physically communicate with TJ to get it signed, he was doing it as a favor for one of his best friends. Sometimes people swallow their pride and pretend things are fine. I don\u2019t like reading into this interaction since we literally didn\u2019t see it.</p><p><b>THE SPOON</b></p><p>The fourth interaction between Jonah and TJ happens at The Spoon. TJ approaches Andi and Cyrus at their booth, where he apologizes to Time-Capsule-Buffy. Shortly after he sits down at the booth, Jonah shows up with plans to meet up with his friend Natalie for lunch. Jonah and Natalie sit down at Andi\u2019s booth with Cyrus and TJ.\u00a0</p><p>We do not see Jonah and TJ even look at each other in this scene. As soon as Jonah sits down, Andi becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Immediately after Andi walks out, TJ says he has to go to work and asks if Cyrus would like to tag along to which Cyrus desperately replies\u00a0\u201cYes, PLEASE\u201d. Jonah is left with Natalie, and looks as if he is disappointed and unsure of what to do next.</p><p>Just like the previous scenes, out of context, this doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal. But when combined with the earlier interactions and what we know is coming next, I think this scene is a big turning point. Think about it\u2026</p><p>This is the second time out of a total of 4 interactions in which TJ has quickly found a reason to leave Jonah. As the audience, we are aware that TJ was not in the wrong in either of these moments. But Jonah\u2019s anxiety triggered by abandonment could easily make him feel insecure over this.</p><p>This is also the second out of a total of 4 interactions in which Cyrus has physically left Jonah to be with TJ. On top of that, this time Cyrus seemed EXCITED to get away from Jonah and be with TJ. We usually see this through our shipping lenses, but it\u2019s not a reach to see why Jonah could be platonically jealous and insecure about this happening.</p><p><b>PING PONG/THE FLASHBACKS</b></p><p>So here\u2019s what we know about the upcoming episode:</p><p>Jonah is over at Cyrus\u2019 house playing ping pong and having a good time, when TJ shows up without warning. Jonah becomes immediately uncomfortable and tries to leave as Cyrus and TJ greet each other. Cyrus tries to find out what happened, Jonah implies that it\u2019s TJ\u2019s fault, and TJ looks completely oblivious to the situation at hand.\u00a0</p><p>Because of the episode description, we know that Cyrus will be mending a long-time rift between Jonah and TJ. Because of casting calls and spoilers from Asher, we know that we will be seeing flashbacks of TJ and Jonah as children, to show what caused this rift.\u00a0</p><p>So here\u2019s my complete theory/timeline of events:</p><ol><li>TJ and Jonah met as children through baseball. They were either on opposing teams or on the same team. TJ did something that hurt Jonah, either emotionally or physically. It was either an accident, or another example of TJ being mean prior to knowing Cyrus.\u00a0<br></li><li>Whatever caused the rift wasn\u2019t anything too serious. TJ probably has not thought about it in years, if at all since it actually happened. Like I said before, this feud is entirely one-sided. TJ has absolutely no grudge or negative feelings towards Jonah, and appears to want to befriend him just as much as he has with Buffy and Andi because he knows that he is a good friend to Cyrus.\u00a0<br></li><li>Whatever caused the rift was also mostly forgotten by Jonah over the years. Although the feud is one-sided, I don\u2019t believe it was constantly festering over the years. Whether it was a misunderstanding or an accident or an example of him being bullied or injured at the hands of TJ, it wasn\u2019t something that Jonah has thought about every day since then. He had pushed it out of his mind and moved on with life, and it wasn\u2019t until recent events that he opened these old wounds.<br></li><li>When TJ found Jonah having a panic attack, he was genuinely worried about him and Jonah was genuinely happy to see a familiar face. But when TJ left and got an adult, despite Jonah asking him not to - it left a bad taste in Jonah\u2019s mouth. He couldn\u2019t tell anyone about it without exposing his own issues, but it definitely made him think about his past interactions with TJ for the first time in years.<br></li><li>Fast forward to Andi, Cyrus, and Jonah on the bleachers to watch Buffy play basketball. Cyrus leaves to check on TJ, and Jonah looks confused by their friendship. By this point he has replayed his childhood rift with TJ, the moment at the Bar Mitzvah, and likely the negative things Andi &amp; Buffy have had to say about TJ on repeat in his head several times. He is uncomfortable with the idea of one of his best friends becoming close with someone who, in Jonah\u2019s eyes, can\u2019t be trusted.\u00a0</li><li>Jonah swallows his discomfort to get a basketball signed for one of his best friends. TJ shows signs of becoming a better person by swallowing his pride to sign the ball for Buffy. This moment is not about the relationship between Jonah and TJ, but rather each of their internal journeys and their friendship with Buffy and TGHC.</li><li>TJ and Cyrus leave shortly after Jonah arrives at The Spoon. As the audience, we know that this moment has nothing to do with the character\u2019s feelings towards Jonah. But Jonah doesn\u2019t see the full story like we do. He feels like there is distance between himself and his only true friends. He and Andi have let their romantic relationship ruin their platonic friendship. Buffy has moved without saying goodbye, and nobody has heard from her. And now Cyrus keeps leaving him to hang out with TJ instead. Given his history of anxiety and fear of being alone, it\u2019s easy to see how Jonah would misread all of these events and find a way to blame TJ for these things, even though TJ hasn\u2019t done anything wrong (recently).</li><li>Jonah finally gets to hang out with Cyrus, for the first time in a long time. We have only seen these two hang out one-on-one a handful of times: when they go to a sporting event together on what was originally planned to be a double date, when they skateboard together and Cyrus ends up in the hospital, when they film the freshmen orientation video together and Cyrus has a panic attack, when they go shopping for a Bar Mitzvah suit together, and when Cyrus comforts Jonah after he fails to make it on the ultimate frisbee team.\u00a0<br><br>This means that the ping-pong hang is one of the first times Jonah and Cyrus have hung out just the two of them since before Cyrus\u2019 Bar Mitzvah. As this line of events plays out, we see most of it through Cyrus\u2019 point of view and give little consideration to what Jonah feels during it. We see it through the lens of Cyrus\u2019 crush on Jonah fading into a platonic friendship. We fail to realize that Cyrus + Jonah have barely had any ~ bro time ~ since before Cyrus became friends with TJ, and before Jonah discovered his anxiety disorder.\u00a0</li></ol><p>It makes perfect sense that Jonah would feel anxious over TJ once again coming in and crashing his time with Cyrus. He fears being alone, and losing his friends. And because of whatever petty trauma he has from childhood involving TJ, it\u2019s very easy for him to blame TJ for everything he is feeling instead of addressing his own internal conflicts and anxiety. Whatever the rift is, it will be resolved within this episode and allow space for all of the characters to grow as friends before the season 3 finale.</p><p>In conclusion: This episode still opens a big opportunity to talk more about Jonah\u2019s anxiety, as well as set up some more Tyrus subtext. If it was written correctly, there is no reason to assume it will mess up any continuity. I\u2019m not sure the result will align with this analysis, but to decide now that the plot is stupid or unplanned or whatever seems silly to me, as all of these past events line up perfectly as subtext for Jonah\u2019s anxiety arc. The end.</p>",
