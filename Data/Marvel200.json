The died on a plane crash \u2013 I never even\nflew in a plane until Germany \u2013 and now look at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dead,\u201d Tony\nreplied.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, sitting\nup. They\u2019d moved away from the crash site a few hours before and had found a\nrelatively peaceful part of the forest terrain to lie down in. Their bodies\nwere coated in ash and blood, watercolour bruises appearing across their skin.\nThey were hurt \u2013 badly, in some cases \u2013 and the staff of the plane were all\nmissing or dead. Tony hoped they were found soon, if only because he didn\u2019t\nknow what lived in the forest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not get morbid so\nsoon,\u201d Tony said, surveying the area for any incoming danger. When he was\nsatisfied that he saw nothing, he moved onto his back once more, side by side\nwith Peter. Tony\u2019s left leg was broken without a doubt, and the pain had moved\nfrom sharp and splicing to a heavy throb. Peter, on the other hand, had be\nsliced and torn with the metal of the plane upon landing, and the gashes across\nhis body were beginning to close at last.</p><p>Peter\u2019s Spiderman suit was\nsomewhere in the wreckage, and the Iron Man armour had only formed around\nPeter\u2019s head and legs when the plane hit the trees, the armour scattering\nsuddenly across the cabin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited a few hours to\nget morbid,\u201d Peter said, \u201cI think I deserve it by this point. Do you think\nhumans can eat grass?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony replied\nimmediately. \u201cWe\u2019re not staying here long enough to try and fail, either.\u201d He\ntipped his head to the side, finding Peter already looking back.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t walk, though,\u201d\nPeter said. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll get cold at night-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plane is on fire right\nover there,\u201d Tony interrupted, keeping his voice light. \u201cIt\u2019ll provide more\nthan enough heat.\u201d</p><p>Peter sighed. \u201cDo you think we\u2019d\nbe better off in a tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d fall out,\u201d Tony said,\nmoving his eyes back up to the canopy of leaves above them, afternoon sun\nburning through. </p><p>They had been on a trip to\nPeru for a week; Tony desperately needing some time away from the city and his work\nand Peter always up for spending time with him. They\u2019d camped for a few nights\nand spent a few more in a nice woman\u2019s home, where there were uncomfortable\nmattresses but hot food. They\u2019d gone sight-seeing, hiking, travelled to the\nancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu and Peter had climbed things he probably\nshouldn\u2019t have when no one was looking so Tony could take photos of him.</p><p>It was just supposed to be a\nway to relax \u2013 and they had. Tony had lost the tenseness in his shoulders, had\nsmiled easier than he had in months, and Peter had read every guide book he\ncould find in advance. The two of them spoke good Spanish and had thrown\nobscure words at each other over dinner tables to see if the other knew what\nthey meant. And Peter had sworn a lot in Spanish, because Tony\u2019s rule was that\nhe just couldn\u2019t swear in English, which Peter took advantage of. Liberally.</p><p>It was a good trip. This\nending wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to go.</p><p>\u201c<i>Mierda. </i>Do you think we should look for the flight attendants?\u201d\nPeter asked. They\u2019d taken Tony\u2019s private plane there and back. His flight\nattendants were Stark Industries staff members and Tony repressed a shudder at\nthe thought of what might\u2019ve happened to them.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Tony\nreplied. \u201cI don\u2019t want you seeing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pilot wasn\u2019t,\u201d Tony said\nbitterly. Peter had found the pilot, too, decapitated, the remaining body\nstrewn about the wreckage. Tony didn\u2019t want Peter finding anymore of them like\nthat, but Peter was the only one of the two who could stand.</p><p>\u201cThey might still be alive,\u201d\nPeter whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, kid, but that shit\nwon\u2019t leave you. I don\u2019t want you seeing that.\u201d</p><p>He watched as Peter struggled\nand sat up. His gashes were visible through his t-shirt and began seeping more\nblood with the movement \u2013 Tony had done what he could to stop the bleeding and\ncover them up, but there wasn\u2019t much to be done out here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check,\u201d Peter\nsaid, and Tony let out a huff, pushing himself off the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome on then,\u201d he replied,\nrolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut your leg-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you search a\ncrashed plane on your own, kid. Help me up.\u201d</p><p>The struggled and limped\ntogether through the trees and back towards the wreckage. Half of the plane was\nstill tangled up in the trees and Tony feared for a big gust of wind, shaking\nthe branches enough to drop it to the ground. The rest was littered about in\nwreckage, seats here, the bar there. The cockpit, where they\u2019d found the pilot\nalready, was off to the left somewhere and Tony actively steered them away from\nthat.</p><p>They searched for about half\nan hour, Tony taking a rest every few minutes and eventually righting the few\nseats he\u2019d found that weren\u2019t utterly destroyed, finding them still kind of\ncomfortable, even burned and blackened. Neither of them, however, found any\nmore bodies, and when Peter started aching too much, they dragged the chairs\naway from the rubble and relaxed into them, staring at the ruin.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if this happened to\nmy parents,\u201d Peter said, and Tony had to stop himself from telling the kid how\nmorbid he was sounding again. \u201cI mean, if they died in the plane on impact, or\nif they were stuck in the area for a while, dying slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dying,\u201d Tony\nreplied.</p><p>\u201cI know. But they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we won\u2019t. I\u2019m not gonna\nlet that happen to you, alright?\u201d</p><p>Peter hummed, shifting in the\nchair to rest his head against Tony\u2019s shoulder. They stayed like that for a\nwhile, ignoring their starving stomachs and the way the light slowly dimmed,\nthe fires beginning to burn themselves out.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s anyone gonna find us?\u201d\nPeter whispered, and for a moment he sounded so small and scared that Tony took\nhis hand and squeezed it, gentle, before he even realised what he\u2019d done.\nNeither let go of the other\u2019s hand, though.</p><p>\u201cThe plane would\u2019ve sent out\na distress signal when the engine blew,\u201d Tony replied, quiet. \u201cThen help would\nbe sent to that location. They\u2019ll find us.\u201d</p><p>And they did.</p><p>It was well past midnight\nwhen the lights shone through the tree line, Spanish words yelled into the\ndistance as the search party manoeuvred through the terrain. Peter woke up from\nhis fitful sleep when they did, Tony watching the floating yellow lights draw\ncloser, calling back to them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here! <i>Ay\u00fadanos!\u201d </i></p><p>They came with stretchers and\nfirst aid kits, with police officers who moved through the plane wreckage in\nsearch for survivors, with fire fighters to put out the flames and fibre bars\nin their pockets, pressed gently into the survivors\u2019 hands.</p><p>They were carried out of the\nforest, to an awaiting ambulance that took them to a hospital, where Tony\u2019s leg\nwas x-rayed and casted and Peter\u2019s wounds sewn up, despite how they healed.</p><p>It was later, when Tony laid\nin a hospital bed, Rhodey on his way in his suit, and Peter sitting on the edge\nof it, playing with some small piece of medical equipment he probably shouldn\u2019t\nhave been touching, that Peter smiled.</p><p>\u201cI had fun, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the plane crashed?\nBecause let me tell you kid, that shit was terrifying.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cPeru.\nThe trip. We should go on trips more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, then his smile\nfaltered. \u201cIt\u2019s probably super inconvenient, but could we not take planes for a\nwhile? I don\u2019t really wanna-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah kid,\u201d Tony interrupted,\nnot needing an explanation. \u201cWe can never step foot in a plane again if that\u2019s\nwhat you want.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, reassured, then\nnudged Tony to scoot over so he could lie down by his side, eyes still on the\nabsolutely-not-supposed-to-be-touched equipment in his hands. When Peter\nyawned, Tony felt his muscles relax. He was never sure he\u2019d believed it until\nhe met Peter, but kids were incredibly resilient.</p><p>Peter shifted until he was\ncomfortable, his head lolling gently onto Tony\u2019s shoulder, and then shut his\neyes.</p><p>\u201cThe photos on our phones,\u201d\nPeter mumbled, \u201cthey synced automatically to FRIDAY, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, barely. \u201cYeah,\nPete,\u201d Tony whispered. \u201cAll our holiday photos are saved, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI\nwanted to show May the photo of me with that llama that didn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\n\nTony snorted. \u201cSure thing,\nkiddo. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll love it.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p>",

I don\u2019t want you seeing that.\u201d</p><p>He watched as Peter struggled\nand sat up. His gashes were visible through his t-shirt and began seeping more\nblood with the movement \u2013 Tony had done what he could to stop the bleeding and\ncover them up, but there wasn\u2019t much to be done out here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check,\u201d Peter\nsaid, and Tony let out a huff, pushing himself off the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome on then,\u201d he replied,\nrolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut your leg-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you search a\ncrashed plane on your own, kid.

Half of the plane was\nstill tangled up in the trees and Tony feared for a big gust of wind, shaking\nthe branches enough to drop it to the ground. The rest was littered about in\nwreckage, seats here, the bar there. The cockpit, where they\u2019d found the pilot\nalready, was off to the left somewhere and Tony actively steered them away from\nthat.</p><p>They searched for about half\nan hour, Tony taking a rest every few minutes and eventually righting the few\nseats he\u2019d found that weren\u2019t utterly destroyed, finding them still kind of\ncomfortable, even burned and blackened. Neither of them, however, found any\nmore bodies, and when Peter started aching too much, they dragged the chairs\naway from the rubble and relaxed into them, staring at the ruin.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if this happened to\nmy parents,\u201d Peter said, and Tony had to stop himself from telling the kid how\nmorbid he was sounding again. \u201cI mean, if they died in the plane on impact, or\nif they were stuck in the area for a while, dying slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dying,\u201d Tony\nreplied.</p><p>\u201cI know.

They stayed like that for a\nwhile, ignoring their starving stomachs and the way the light slowly dimmed,\nthe fires beginning to burn themselves out.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s anyone gonna find us?\u201d\nPeter whispered, and for a moment he sounded so small and scared that Tony took\nhis hand and squeezed it, gentle, before he even realised what he\u2019d done.\nNeither let go of the other\u2019s hand, though.</p><p>\u201cThe plane would\u2019ve sent out\na distress signal when the engine blew,\u201d Tony replied, quiet. \u201cThen help would\nbe sent to that location. They\u2019ll find us.\u201d</p><p>And they did.</p><p>It was well past midnight\nwhen the lights shone through the tree line, Spanish words yelled into the\ndistance as the search party manoeuvred through the terrain. Peter woke up from\nhis fitful sleep when they did, Tony watching the floating yellow lights draw\ncloser, calling back to them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here! <i>Ay\u00fadanos!\u201d </i></p><p>They came with stretchers and\nfirst aid kits, with police officers who moved through the plane wreckage in\nsearch for survivors, with fire fighters to put out the flames and fibre bars\nin their pockets, pressed gently into the survivors\u2019 hands.</p><p>They were carried out of the\nforest, to an awaiting ambulance that took them to a hospital, where Tony\u2019s leg\nwas x-rayed and casted and Peter\u2019s wounds sewn up, despite how they healed.</p><p>It was later, when Tony laid\nin a hospital bed, Rhodey on his way in his suit, and Peter sitting on the edge\nof it, playing with some small piece of medical equipment he probably shouldn\u2019t\nhave been touching, that Peter smiled.</p><p>\u201cI had fun, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the plane crashed?\nBecause let me tell you kid, that shit was terrifying.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cPeru.\nThe trip. We should go on trips more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, then his smile\nfaltered. \u201cIt\u2019s probably super inconvenient, but could we not take planes for a\nwhile? I don\u2019t really wanna-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah kid,\u201d Tony interrupted,\nnot needing an explanation. \u201cWe can never step foot in a plane again if that\u2019s\nwhat you want.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, reassured, then\nnudged Tony to scoot over so he could lie down by his side, eyes still on the\nabsolutely-not-supposed-to-be-touched equipment in his hands. When Peter\nyawned, Tony felt his muscles relax. He was never sure he\u2019d believed it until\nhe met Peter, but kids were incredibly resilient.</p><p>Peter shifted until he was\ncomfortable, his head lolling gently onto Tony\u2019s shoulder, and then shut his\neyes.</p><p>\u201cThe photos on our phones,\u201d\nPeter mumbled, \u201cthey synced automatically to FRIDAY, right?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, barely. \u201cYeah,\nPete,\u201d Tony whispered. \u201cAll our holiday photos are saved, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI\nwanted to show May the photo of me with that llama that didn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\n\nTony snorted. \u201cSure thing,\nkiddo.

Peter, on the other hand, had be\nsliced and torn with the metal of the plane upon landing, and the gashes across\nhis body were beginning to close at last.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s Spiderman suit was\nsomewhere in the wreckage, and the Iron Man armour had only formed around\nPeter&rsquo;s head and legs when the plane hit the trees, the armour scattering\nsuddenly across the cabin.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited a few hours to\nget morbid,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;I think I deserve it by this point. Do you think\nhumans can eat grass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tony replied\nimmediately. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not staying here long enough to try and fail, either.&rdquo; He\ntipped his head to the side, finding Peter already looking back.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t walk, though,&rdquo;\nPeter said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll get cold at night-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The plane is on fire right\nover there,&rdquo; Tony interrupted, keeping his voice light. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll provide more\nthan enough heat.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sighed. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;d\nbe better off in a tree?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d fall out,&rdquo; Tony said,\nmoving his eyes back up to the canopy of leaves above them, afternoon sun\nburning through. </p><p>They had been on a trip to\nPeru for a week; Tony desperately needing some time away from the city and his work\nand Peter always up for spending time with him. They&rsquo;d camped for a few nights\nand spent a few more in a nice woman&rsquo;s home, where there were uncomfortable\nmattresses but hot food. They&rsquo;d gone sight-seeing, hiking, travelled to the\nancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu and Peter had climbed things he probably\nshouldn&rsquo;t have when no one was looking so Tony could take photos of him.</p><p>It was just supposed to be a\nway to relax &ndash; and they had. Tony had lost the tenseness in his shoulders, had\nsmiled easier than he had in months, and Peter had read every guide book he\ncould find in advance. The two of them spoke good Spanish and had thrown\nobscure words at each other over dinner tables to see if the other knew what\nthey meant. And Peter had sworn a lot in Spanish, because Tony&rsquo;s rule was that\nhe just couldn&rsquo;t swear in English, which Peter took advantage of. Liberally.</p><p>It was a good trip. This\nending wasn&rsquo;t how it was supposed to go.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mierda. </i>Do you think we should look for the flight attendants?&rdquo;\nPeter asked. They&rsquo;d taken Tony&rsquo;s private plane there and back. His flight\nattendants were Stark Industries staff members and Tony repressed a shudder at\nthe thought of what might&rsquo;ve happened to them.</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tony\nreplied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you seeing that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if they&rsquo;re alive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The pilot wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tony said\nbitterly. Peter had found the pilot, too, decapitated, the remaining body\nstrewn about the wreckage. Tony didn&rsquo;t want Peter finding anymore of them like\nthat, but Peter was the only one of the two who could stand.</p><p>&ldquo;They might still be alive,&rdquo;\nPeter whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, kid, but that shit\nwon&rsquo;t leave you. I don&rsquo;t want you seeing that.&rdquo;</p><p>He watched as Peter struggled\nand sat up. His gashes were visible through his t-shirt and began seeping more\nblood with the movement &ndash; Tony had done what he could to stop the bleeding and\ncover them up, but there wasn&rsquo;t much to be done out here.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to check,&rdquo; Peter\nsaid, and Tony let out a huff, pushing himself off the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on then,&rdquo; he replied,\nrolling his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;But your leg-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not letting you search a\ncrashed plane on your own, kid. Help me up.&rdquo;</p><p>The struggled and limped\ntogether through the trees and back towards the wreckage. Half of the plane was\nstill tangled up in the trees and Tony feared for a big gust of wind, shaking\nthe branches enough to drop it to the ground. The rest was littered about in\nwreckage, seats here, the bar there. The cockpit, where they&rsquo;d found the pilot\nalready, was off to the left somewhere and Tony actively steered them away from\nthat.</p><p>They searched for about half\nan hour, Tony taking a rest every few minutes and eventually righting the few\nseats he&rsquo;d found that weren&rsquo;t utterly destroyed, finding them still kind of\ncomfortable, even burned and blackened. Neither of them, however, found any\nmore bodies, and when Peter started aching too much, they dragged the chairs\naway from the rubble and relaxed into them, staring at the ruin.</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder if this happened to\nmy parents,&rdquo; Peter said, and Tony had to stop himself from telling the kid how\nmorbid he was sounding again. &ldquo;I mean, if they died in the plane on impact, or\nif they were stuck in the area for a while, dying slowly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dying,&rdquo; Tony\nreplied.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. But they did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And we won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not gonna\nlet that happen to you, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hummed, shifting in the\nchair to rest his head against Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. They stayed like that for a\nwhile, ignoring their starving stomachs and the way the light slowly dimmed,\nthe fires beginning to burn themselves out.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s anyone gonna find us?&rdquo;\nPeter whispered, and for a moment he sounded so small and scared that Tony took\nhis hand and squeezed it, gentle, before he even realised what he&rsquo;d done.\nNeither let go of the other&rsquo;s hand, though.</p><p>&ldquo;The plane would&rsquo;ve sent out\na distress signal when the engine blew,&rdquo; Tony replied, quiet. &ldquo;Then help would\nbe sent to that location. They&rsquo;ll find us.&rdquo;</p><p>And they did.</p><p>It was well past midnight\nwhen the lights shone through the tree line, Spanish words yelled into the\ndistance as the search party manoeuvred through the terrain. Peter woke up from\nhis fitful sleep when they did, Tony watching the floating yellow lights draw\ncloser, calling back to them.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here! <i>Ay&uacute;danos!&rdquo; </i></p><p>They came with stretchers and\nfirst aid kits, with police officers who moved through the plane wreckage in\nsearch for survivors, with fire fighters to put out the flames and fibre bars\nin their pockets, pressed gently into the survivors&rsquo; hands.</p><p>They were carried out of the\nforest, to an awaiting ambulance that took them to a hospital, where Tony&rsquo;s leg\nwas x-rayed and casted and Peter&rsquo;s wounds sewn up, despite how they healed.</p><p>It was later, when Tony laid\nin a hospital bed, Rhodey on his way in his suit, and Peter sitting on the edge\nof it, playing with some small piece of medical equipment he probably shouldn&rsquo;t\nhave been touching, that Peter smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I had fun, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When the plane crashed?\nBecause let me tell you kid, that shit was terrifying.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head. &ldquo;Peru.\nThe trip. We should go on trips more often.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, then his smile\nfaltered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably super inconvenient, but could we not take planes for a\nwhile? I don&rsquo;t really wanna-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah kid,&rdquo; Tony interrupted,\nnot needing an explanation. &ldquo;We can never step foot in a plane again if that&rsquo;s\nwhat you want.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, reassured, then\nnudged Tony to scoot over so he could lie down by his side, eyes still on the\nabsolutely-not-supposed-to-be-touched equipment in his hands. When Peter\nyawned, Tony felt his muscles relax. He was never sure he&rsquo;d believed it until\nhe met Peter, but kids were incredibly resilient.</p><p>Peter shifted until he was\ncomfortable, his head lolling gently onto Tony&rsquo;s shoulder, and then shut his\neyes.</p><p>&ldquo;The photos on our phones,&rdquo;\nPeter mumbled, &ldquo;they synced automatically to FRIDAY, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded, barely. &ldquo;Yeah,\nPete,&rdquo; Tony whispered. &ldquo;All our holiday photos are saved, don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I\nwanted to show May the photo of me with that llama that didn&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nTony snorted. &ldquo;Sure thing,\nkiddo. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll love it.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n</p>",

The died on a plane crash &ndash; I never even\nflew in a plane until Germany &ndash; and now look at us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dead,&rdquo; Tony\nreplied.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony rolled his eyes, sitting\nup. They&rsquo;d moved away from the crash site a few hours before and had found a\nrelatively peaceful part of the forest terrain to lie down in. Their bodies\nwere coated in ash and blood, watercolour bruises appearing across their skin.\nThey were hurt &ndash; badly, in some cases &ndash; and the staff of the plane were all\nmissing or dead. Tony hoped they were found soon, if only because he didn&rsquo;t\nknow what lived in the forest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not get morbid so\nsoon,&rdquo; Tony said, surveying the area for any incoming danger.
