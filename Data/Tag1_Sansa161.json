Winterfell.</p><p>Most people didn\u2019t know the truth of where that name came from \u2013 the reason behind House Stark\u2019s sigil.\u00a0 They assumed it had no true reason.\u00a0 They believed the direwolf was merely an exceptionally strong animal that the first Starks saw and rather liked.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t know it was for someone.</p><p>There was never much information on House (L/N).\u00a0 All that anyone knew for certain was that they never left their frozen territory in the farthest reaches of the North and that they were fiercely loyal to the Starks.\u00a0 There were rumors, though.\u00a0 Whispers about the danger they posed to anyone who dared cross them.</p><p>Recently the family has been under scrutiny for two reasons.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The first was born of suspicion.\u00a0 After the Boltons took Winterfell, the entire country was terrified of how you might retaliate.\u00a0 They had been told stories of the lengths the house would go to in defense of their liege.\u00a0 It almost felt as though they were all holding their breath.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The second reason seemed to be more of a curiosity.\u00a0 House (L/N) had recently been handed down to the eldest daughter of (Y/F/N) (L/N), and immediately the world wanted to know who the new leader of the fearless house was.\u00a0 She was said to be strong, wise, and kind \u2013 a leader from birth, as the letters announcing her recent inheritance put it.\u00a0 What made the people truly curious, though, was the tales of her looks.\u00a0 No one had seen someone of such elegance and beauty since Lyanna Stark, and there were even some elders who claimed that this new woman was even more beautiful than the flower of the North.\u00a0 Still, no one knew for certain, as you and your house continued to stay hidden from the world.</p><p>\u2013Sansa\u2019s POV\u2013</p><p>Yet another night in this gods-forsaken place.\u00a0 I almost couldn\u2019t take it anymore \u2013 the beatings as well as seeing what was once my home being overrun by traitors.\u00a0 More than anything, I simply couldn\u2019t stand to be forced by Ramsay\u2019s side.\u00a0 He was cruel and hateful and everything I detested in a partner.</p><p>My mind flashed to you.\u00a0 The only person I ever truly wanted to be with.\u00a0 My heart still ached whenever I recalled the day I\u2019d told my parents how much I wished to marry you.\u00a0 They had immediately forbade it, saying that I would be marrying a young lord when I came of age, and that was the last time they ever wanted to hear or it.\u00a0 Soon after that, you had stopped visiting.\u00a0 I had ruined everything.</p><p>I sighed and pushed the thought from my mind.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t keep torturing myself with thoughts of you.\u00a0 I had to move on.\u00a0 Even if I almost couldn\u2019t bear the thought of doing so.</p><p>Suddenly, shouting erupted from the courtyard below.\u00a0 I furrowed my brows and moved to the window, where I saw Bolton soldiers scrambling about, trying to find something to do.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, beg your pardon, but Winterfell is under attack,\u201d a maid had appeared in the doorway, which was usually locked from the outside.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I gasped.\u00a0 Someone was here.\u00a0 Was it Jon?\u00a0 Had he left the Wall to come save me?\u00a0 Or perhaps someone even worse than the Boltons.\u00a0 I quickly sent a prayer to the gods, begging for it to be anyone other than the Lannisters.<br></p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u00a0 I\u2019m here to get you to safety,\u201d she said, motioning for me to follow her into the hallway.\u00a0 I frowned and glanced back out the window.<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I stated firmly.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m staying here.\u00a0 Now leave.\u201d\u00a0 If it was Jon out there, he would be able to find me in my room, and if it was someone horrible, at least I might die rather than be captured again.\u00a0 Behind me, the door clicked shut.\u00a0 I sat back down on the bed.\u00a0 No matter what happened now, I would accept it.<br></p><p>\u2013Time Skip\u2013</p><p>Silence.</p><p>After hours of yelling orders, swords clashing, and screams of pain, the only thing to drift through my window was silence.\u00a0 The battle must be over.</p><p>Still, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to look outside and risk the chance of being greeted with the sigil of the flayed man where the beautiful direwolf once stood tall and proud.</p><p>I could hear the sound of footsteps making their way through the hallway and stopping outside of my door.\u00a0 My breath caught in my throat.\u00a0 This was it.</p><p>The door opened, revealing a young solder and a large, (H/C) wolf at his side, standing so tall it reminded me of poor Lady.\u00a0 I backed up a bit, my heart pounding in my chest as I stared warily at the unfamiliar face and the terrifying creature.</p><p>The wolf approached slowly, its eyes holding mine in a deadlocked stare.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t move or speak or even think as we stared at one another.\u00a0 I found myself almost entranced by the large, (E/C) eyes.\u00a0 Soon, it was just a hair\u2019s breadth away from me, its nose twitching as it sniffed at my dress as though it was deciding what to do with me.</p><p>Then something happened that I would have never imagined to be possible.</p><p>The wolf changed.</p><p>Fur became skin, paws turned to feet and hands, and its long nose shrunk into a soft-featured face.\u00a0 Standing before me now was the dearest friend and strongest love I\u2019d ever known.</p><p>It was you.</p><p>\u201cThank the gods you\u2019re ok,\u201d you whispered weakly, engulfing me in an almost strangling hug.\u00a0 When I didn\u2019t move, you pulled back.\u00a0 I felt colder now without your arms around me.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know this must be a shock to you.\u00a0 I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0The words were barely registering in my overwhelmed mind.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cListen, I\u2019ll be in my old guest room.\u00a0 Whenever you are ready, just come over, alright?\u201d\u00a0 I nodded slowly, and you quickly exited, whispering something to the soldier as you did, causing him to abruptly follow you.<br></p><p>There were so many things that I should have been thinking about right then, the most prominent of which being that you were actually a wolf not five minutes ago.\u00a0 Still, my thoughts refused to dwell on anything other than the young man who followed you.\u00a0 You seemed close, and I began to question whether he might be you betrothed or perhaps even you husband.</p><p>Quickly, I made up m mind, rushing down the hall to the room I knew you\u2019d be in.\u00a0 I swung the door open to reveal you, taking in your appearance for the first time in years.\u00a0 You were wearing a deep grey and dark blue dress \u2013 the colors of House (L/N) \u2013 that fell halfway down your shins with long slits on either side.\u00a0 Armour covered your chest and stomach with the bleeding heart in the center, the bright red of your sigil a stark contrast to the dark colors.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u00a0 Are you ok?\u201d You asked, your brows furrowing ever so slightly.<br></p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d I asked, completely ignoring your question and striding across the room.\u00a0 You backed up as I approached, eventually hitting your back against the stone wall.</p><p>\u201cWho is who?\u201d You said warily, leaning slightly away from me.</p><p>I ground my teeth together, my impatience building. \u00a0\u201cThe boy who was with you earlier,\u201d I spat out the words like they were poison on my tongue. \u00a0\u201cThe one wearing your family\u2019s sigil.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes lightened slowly in recognition. \u00a0\u201cYou mean Ryen? \u00a0He is no one \u2013 merely a squire who served my father and now serves me,\u201d you rushed, your eyes darting back and forth in an attempt to gauge my reaction.</p><p>Relief filled my chest and overwhelmed my senses. \u00a0Before I knew what I was doing, I had grabbed you by the waist and the back of the neck and slammed my lips against yours. \u00a0You gasped in surprise but quickly melted into the kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine now. \u00a0Do you understand?\u201d I whispered softly, my lips brushing ever so gently against your ear. \u00a0You whimpered and nodded, any trace of the fierce dominance that you had just shown on the battlefield vanished.</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated me,\u201d you murmured, still not having fully regained your breath.</p><p>\u201cI could never hate you,\u201d I growled, forcing you to meet my eyes and understand the meaning behind my words. \u00a0I pulled you back into my arms, placing a softer, more intimate kiss on your lips. \u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d I said softly, still not breaking the connection.

Bran\u2019s story line in the books is steeped in symbolism, philosophical questions and being played out as a horror story (the Jojen paste being a prime example - one the show chose to eliminate). It doesn\u2019t mesh well with the Ds love for bombast and huge spectacle.\u00a0</p><p>Now, as to the reason behind Bran\u2019s interaction with Sansa \u2026 I think Bran took Sansa\u2019s amused comment as her not believing him and requiring further proof, hence him triggering her PTSD. It was meant to show not only Sansa that he was who he said he was but also show the audience his callousness in talking about that particular experience. It also added to the isolation Sansa felt through out season 7 and that was meant to increase the odds of her siding with LF in the audience\u2019s eyes. On a larger scale, it\u2019s sort of a strange thing but Sansa, the person who pushed for the reunion of her family the most, ends up being alienated from both Arya and Bran. Her only wholly positive relationship keeps being her relationship with Jon, which if Jonsa were to happen, would only increase the deep connection they have.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

It also added to the isolation Sansa felt through out season 7 and that was meant to increase the odds of her siding with LF in the audience&rsquo;s eyes. On a larger scale, it&rsquo;s sort of a strange thing but Sansa, the person who pushed for the reunion of her family the most, ends up being alienated from both Arya and Bran. Her only wholly positive relationship keeps being her relationship with Jon, which if Jonsa were to happen, would only increase the deep connection they have.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

        "question": "Do you subscribe to the theory that Jamie is The Prince that was Promised/Azor Ahai? It certainly makes a lot of sense.  I can't see anyone being Nissa Nissa but Cersei.  There just aren't too many true couples on this show and if anyone was going to kill their loved one it would be him for so many reasons.  I mention this because it could tie into the whole Sansa kidnapping plot.  I can see this actually happening first. Jon will definitely put WW on hold for Sansa.  Jamie killing Cersei",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\n\nAlso, Dany could fulfill the Younger more Beautiful Queen. This needs to happen before Cersei dies and Sansa just doesn\u2019t fit that role yet. Dany could very well end up in KL trying to take the Throne from Cersei instead of helping with the WW. Sansa taking everything she holds dear also really doesn\u2019t fit. I mean she thinks she took Joffrey from her but she really didn\u2019t. But what she holds dear now is power. And the only realistic threat to that at the start of 7 is Dany.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nSo maybe Dany is on the Throne pretty early and during the WW? Sorry for the long ask. Thank you for answering!\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>Firstly never apologize for long asks. I love hearing from you guys. :)</p><p>Onto the questions:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nDo you subscribe to the theory that Jamie is The Prince that was Promised/Azor Ahai?\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>No, I don\u2019t. For one, I\u2019m not convinced that The Prince that was Promised and Azor Ahai are the same person. Melisandre is the only one to mention both prophecies as pertaining to the same person but Mel is an especially unreliable prophecy reader. Aside from her, Maester Aemon mentions the Prince that was promised as well but makes no mention of Azor Ahai and it seems that Rhaegar first believed he was the prince that was promised to then switch and think that his son by Elia Martell was this prohecized hero. And because Rahegar was an idiot who could bungle a glass of water, he also believed that this was somehow related to the Dragon must have 3 heads prophecy of which we know absolutely nothing at this point.\u00a0</p><p>Here\u2019s what we know about the prince that was promised. He was \u201cBorn amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star\u201d and:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe prince is said to have \u201ca song\u201d, the song of ice and fire.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>We don\u2019t know if Rhaegar also believed the prince that was promised was Azor Ahai so the entire connection between these 2 prophecies seems to come from Melissandre. And again, I wouldn\u2019t put much stock in what she thinks because she\u2019s a religious fanatic who actually manipulates events to suit the prophecy (having Stannis pull a fake Lightbringer from the flames on Dragonstone) because she really, really wants it to be true.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure the prince that was promised is Jon. His is the only story that is linked to both fire and ice. He is the literal product of the song of ice and fire (the son of a Targareyen and a Stark) and his story is connected to both ice and fire through out. He fights against Ice in the form of the White Walkers and he encounters both the false Azor Ahai (Stannis) and now D*ny, who is the person associated the most with fire in the series. If the Dance of Dragons 2.0 and dark D*ny theories become canon, his song of ice and fire would be his titular role in both these great wars that are about to visit Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>But this is only supposition on my part at the moment because we simply do not have enough information to make an informed guess on this theory.\u00a0</p><p>Now, onto Azor Ahai. Who is this guy? <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai\">According to the Ice and Fire wiki:</a>\u00a0</p><p>Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero\u2019s sword.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3\">[3]</a></sup> He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.</p><p>The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3\">[3]</a></sup></p><p>The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nissa_Nissa\" title=\"Nissa Nissa\">Nissa Nissa</a>, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer\" title=\"Lightbringer\">Lightbringer</a>, the Red Sword of Heroes.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3\">[3]</a></sup></p><p>Although he had Lightbringer, Azor Ahai did not fight alone.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Rasos76.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-5\">[5]</a></sup> The <i><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jade_Compendium\" title=\"Jade Compendium\">Jade Compendium</a></i> mentions that when the hero thrust the blade through a monster, the creature burst into flame.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Radwd10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-6\">[6]</a></sup></p><p>So Azor Ahai is a mythical figure that hails from Asshai and he kills his wife in order to forge a sword that then kills creatures by bursting them into flames. Cool \u2026\u00a0</p><p>Now, considering that this legend comes from across the world from the place where the Long Night happened, that this grisly tale of human sacrifice is toted around by religious fanatics who then use it to burn people at the stake, does it seem likely to you that this guy is meant to be the savior of humanity? Does it seem likely that this obsession with fire could actually lead to defeating the WWs, creatures we know are impervious to fire?\u00a0</p><p>Also, note that the actual story of Azor Ahai is not told to us by Melissandre, Azor Ahai\u2019s greatest fan girl but rather it\u2019s told to Davos by his pirate friend, as a cautionary tale about the dangers of believing in prophecies and the dark underbelly of blood magic.\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s far more likely that Azor Ahai is not a hero. He\u2019s a villain and the elemental opposite to the Night King.\u00a0\n\n R'hllor followers herald Azor Ahai\u2019s second coming with such encouraging words as:\u00a0\u201c he will bring an eternal summer\u201d which sounds great if you worship fire but in reality an eternal summer is about as bad as an eternal winter. If the WWs unbalance the world by plunging it into night and winter, Azor Ahai is supposed not to bring balance back but to unbalance it in the opposite direction.\u00a0</p><p>Considering the placement of Azor Ahai in complete opposition to the WW and the obsession with fire of the followers of R\u2019hllor, I\u2019d say that the best candidate for this position is one D*enerys Targareyen, which doesn\u2019t sound surprising since many people theorize the same. The twist is that AA was never meant to be a hero but rather an antagonist. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168087267884/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\">a fantastic series</a> regarding this topic and I would encourage you to read it. She goes into a lot more detail than I am able to provide.\u00a0</p><p>If anyone is destined to be the hero to save the world from the Long Night that character is Bran Stark. Except that his story doesn\u2019t link to Azor Ahai but rather to the legend of the Last Hero, who is also identified as Bran the Builder (this connection is not fully established yet but I believe the characters of the Last Hero and Bran the Builder to be one and the same). What do we know about the Last Hero?\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nLegends of the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/North\" title=\"North\">north</a> state the last hero and his companions went in search of the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Children_of_the_forest\" title=\"Children of the forest\">children of the forest</a> during the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Long_Night\" title=\"Long Night\">Long Night</a>, thousands of years ago.

What I do believe is that no matter what this turns out to be, it won\u2019t be played straight. In a series that has highlighted the dangers of prophecies, I just can\u2019t see a human sacrifice, if it does anything, to lead to anything good or at least to its intended purpose (people theorize that the burning of Shireen paid for Jon\u2019s life, however that was not the intended purpose of that sacrifice, nor is that an element present in the repeated resurrections of Beric Dondarrion).\u00a0</p><p>I do think Jaime is the valonqar that\u00a0\n\u201cshall wrap his hands about Cersei\u2019s pale white throat and choke the life from her\u201d but I don\u2019t think that has anything to do with the Azor Ahai and/or Prince that was promised prophecies.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAlso, Dany could fulfill the Younger more Beautiful Queen.

I believe that D*ny is a red herring for this prophecy, much in the same way that Maergery was a red herring. D*ny seems the obvious answer but her story isn\u2019t linked to Cersei\u2019s in any way. Their clashing is incidental, because one sits the Iron Throne and the other covets it. There\u2019s nothing personal there to make the fulfillment of this prophecy resonate.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAye.

Or Sansa could be queen by that point. That is also possible. If the marriage between her and Jon happens prior to the downfall of Cersei, she could be another queen. Also Sansa has been intimately involved in all of Cersei\u2019s tragedies even though she is not directly responsible. She was the one that carried the poison that killed Jofferey, the war with her brother is the reason why Mycella was sent to Dorne, Jofferey\u2019s death leads to Tommen becoming king and eventually killing himself.

I love hearing from you guys. :)</p><p>Onto the questions:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nDo you subscribe to the theory that Jamie is The Prince that was Promised/Azor Ahai?\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>No, I don\u2019t. For one, I\u2019m not convinced that The Prince that was Promised and Azor Ahai are the same person. Melisandre is the only one to mention both prophecies as pertaining to the same person but Mel is an especially unreliable prophecy reader. Aside from her, Maester Aemon mentions the Prince that was promised as well but makes no mention of Azor Ahai and it seems that Rhaegar first believed he was the prince that was promised to then switch and think that his son by Elia Martell was this prohecized hero. And because Rahegar was an idiot who could bungle a glass of water, he also believed that this was somehow related to the Dragon must have 3 heads prophecy of which we know absolutely nothing at this point.\u00a0</p><p>Here\u2019s what we know about the prince that was promised. He was \u201cBorn amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star\u201d and:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe prince is said to have \u201ca song\u201d, the song of ice and fire.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>We don\u2019t know if Rhaegar also believed the prince that was promised was Azor Ahai so the entire connection between these 2 prophecies seems to come from Melissandre. And again, I wouldn\u2019t put much stock in what she thinks because she\u2019s a religious fanatic who actually manipulates events to suit the prophecy (having Stannis pull a fake Lightbringer from the flames on Dragonstone) because she really, really wants it to be true.\u00a0<br></p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure the prince that was promised is Jon. His is the only story that is linked to both fire and ice. He is the literal product of the song of ice and fire (the son of a Targareyen and a Stark) and his story is connected to both ice and fire through out. He fights against Ice in the form of the White Walkers and he encounters both the false Azor Ahai (Stannis) and now D*ny, who is the person associated the most with fire in the series. If the Dance of Dragons 2.0 and dark D*ny theories become canon, his song of ice and fire would be his titular role in both these great wars that are about to visit Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>But this is only supposition on my part at the moment because we simply do not have enough information to make an informed guess on this theory.\u00a0</p><p>Now, onto Azor Ahai. Who is this guy? <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai\">According to the Ice and Fire wiki:</a>\u00a0</p><p>Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero\u2019s sword.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3\">[3]</a></sup> He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.</p><p>The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3\">[3]</a></sup></p><p>The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nissa_Nissa\" title=\"Nissa Nissa\">Nissa Nissa</a>, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer\" title=\"Lightbringer\">Lightbringer</a>, the Red Sword of Heroes.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Racok10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-3\">[3]</a></sup></p><p>Although he had Lightbringer, Azor Ahai did not fight alone.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Rasos76.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-5\">[5]</a></sup> The <i><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jade_Compendium\" title=\"Jade Compendium\">Jade Compendium</a></i> mentions that when the hero thrust the blade through a monster, the creature burst into flame.<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#cite_note-Radwd10.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-6\">[6]</a></sup></p><p>So Azor Ahai is a mythical figure that hails from Asshai and he kills his wife in order to forge a sword that then kills creatures by bursting them into flames. Cool \u2026\u00a0</p><p>Now, considering that this legend comes from across the world from the place where the Long Night happened, that this grisly tale of human sacrifice is toted around by religious fanatics who then use it to burn people at the stake, does it seem likely to you that this guy is meant to be the savior of humanity? Does it seem likely that this obsession with fire could actually lead to defeating the WWs, creatures we know are impervious to fire?\u00a0</p><p>Also, note that the actual story of Azor Ahai is not told to us by Melissandre, Azor Ahai\u2019s greatest fan girl but rather it\u2019s told to Davos by his pirate friend, as a cautionary tale about the dangers of believing in prophecies and the dark underbelly of blood magic.\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s far more likely that Azor Ahai is not a hero. He\u2019s a villain and the elemental opposite to the Night King.\u00a0\n\n R'hllor followers herald Azor Ahai\u2019s second coming with such encouraging words as:\u00a0\u201c he will bring an eternal summer\u201d which sounds great if you worship fire but in reality an eternal summer is about as bad as an eternal winter. If the WWs unbalance the world by plunging it into night and winter, Azor Ahai is supposed not to bring balance back but to unbalance it in the opposite direction.\u00a0</p><p>Considering the placement of Azor Ahai in complete opposition to the WW and the obsession with fire of the followers of R\u2019hllor, I\u2019d say that the best candidate for this position is one D*enerys Targareyen, which doesn\u2019t sound surprising since many people theorize the same. The twist is that AA was never meant to be a hero but rather an antagonist. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168087267884/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\">a fantastic series</a> regarding this topic and I would encourage you to read it. She goes into a lot more detail than I am able to provide.\u00a0</p><p>If anyone is destined to be the hero to save the world from the Long Night that character is Bran Stark. Except that his story doesn\u2019t link to Azor Ahai but rather to the legend of the Last Hero, who is also identified as Bran the Builder (this connection is not fully established yet but I believe the characters of the Last Hero and Bran the Builder to be one and the same). What do we know about the Last Hero?\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nLegends of the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/North\" title=\"North\">north</a> state the last hero and his companions went in search of the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Children_of_the_forest\" title=\"Children of the forest\">children of the forest</a> during the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Long_Night\" title=\"Long Night\">Long Night</a>, thousands of years ago. The only survivor of the company after attacks from <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Giants\" title=\"Giants\">giants</a>, <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wights\" title=\"Wights\">wights</a>, and <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others\" title=\"Others\">Others</a>, the last hero eventually reached the children and gained their assistance. The <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_Watch\" title=\"Night's Watch\">Night\u2019s Watch</a> then formed and won the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_for_the_Dawn\" title=\"Battle for the Dawn\">Battle for the Dawn</a>. This ended the generation-long winter and sent the Others into retreat,<sup><a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Last_hero#cite_note-Rtwoiaf_ancient_history:_the_long_night.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-1\">[1]</a></sup>possibly to the <a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Land_of_Always_Winter\" title=\"Land of Always Winter\">Land of Always Winter</a>.

The fate of the last hero is unknown.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>If the theory that Bran the Builder and the last hero being the same person is true, then we also know that this first Bran (who incidentally is mentioned in connection to our Bran in the series by Maester Luwin), with the help of giants and the children of the forest, also built the Wall to keep the WWs at bay. So the legend in Westeros, the epicenter of the first Long Night, includes no human sacrifices and no mention of fire but does include a Wall that still stands to this day that has magical properties.\u00a0</p><p>As for Nissa Nissa, it\u2019s hard to know who or what she represents at this point. We don\u2019t know how much of Azor Ahai\u2019s story is made up or embellished and we don\u2019t know the true purpose of this story. I don\u2019t think the show will shed much light on this since the Nissa Nissa story is never really brought up in the show. What I do believe is that no matter what this turns out to be, it won\u2019t be played straight. In a series that has highlighted the dangers of prophecies, I just can\u2019t see a human sacrifice, if it does anything, to lead to anything good or at least to its intended purpose (people theorize that the burning of Shireen paid for Jon\u2019s life, however that was not the intended purpose of that sacrifice, nor is that an element present in the repeated resurrections of Beric Dondarrion).\u00a0</p><p>I do think Jaime is the valonqar that\u00a0\n\u201cshall wrap his hands about Cersei\u2019s pale white throat and choke the life from her\u201d but I don\u2019t think that has anything to do with the Azor Ahai and/or Prince that was promised prophecies.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAlso, Dany could fulfill the Younger more Beautiful Queen. This needs to happen before Cersei dies and Sansa just doesn\u2019t fit that role yet. \n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>I disagree. I believe that D*ny is a red herring for this prophecy, much in the same way that Maergery was a red herring. D*ny seems the obvious answer but her story isn\u2019t linked to Cersei\u2019s in any way. Their clashing is incidental, because one sits the Iron Throne and the other covets it. There\u2019s nothing personal there to make the fulfillment of this prophecy resonate.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAye. Queen you shall be\u2026 until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>You could assume that this\u00a0\u201cother\u201d is another queen but it need not be.\u00a0\u201cAnother\u201d could simply refer to another person/woman. Or Sansa could be queen by that point. That is also possible. If the marriage between her and Jon happens prior to the downfall of Cersei, she could be another queen. Also Sansa has been intimately involved in all of Cersei\u2019s tragedies even though she is not directly responsible. She was the one that carried the poison that killed Jofferey, the war with her brother is the reason why Mycella was sent to Dorne, Jofferey\u2019s death leads to Tommen becoming king and eventually killing himself. And, by the end of this series, Sansa might end up as queen of the Seven Kingdoms effectively replacing Cersei.\u00a0</p><p>It isn\u2019t that Sansa is directly responsible for what happens to Cersei but that she ends up taking everything from her in a way that no one could have predicted unless you look back at the events. This is the type of twist that GRRM loves to use with his prophecies, whereas D*ny being the YMBQ would be playing it straight and rather uninspiringly so.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s also the matter of D*ny being foreshadowed never to touch the Iron Throne. They made a point of showing it in the series so I\u2019m pretty certain D*ny will never sit down in that chair or be Queen of the 7 kingdoms even temporarily.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!\u00a0</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>\n\nAlso, Dany could fulfill the Younger more Beautiful Queen. This needs to happen before Cersei dies and Sansa just doesn&rsquo;t fit that role yet. Dany could very well end up in KL trying to take the Throne from Cersei instead of helping with the WW. Sansa taking everything she holds dear also really doesn&rsquo;t fit. I mean she thinks she took Joffrey from her but she really didn&rsquo;t. But what she holds dear now is power. And the only realistic threat to that at the start of 7 is Dany.\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nSo maybe Dany is on the Throne pretty early and during the WW? Sorry for the long ask. Thank you for answering!\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>Firstly never apologize for long asks. I love hearing from you guys. :)</p><p>Onto the questions:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nDo you subscribe to the theory that Jamie is The Prince that was Promised/Azor Ahai?\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>No, I don&rsquo;t. For one, I&rsquo;m not convinced that The Prince that was Promised and Azor Ahai are the same person. Melisandre is the only one to mention both prophecies as pertaining to the same person but Mel is an especially unreliable prophecy reader. Aside from her, Maester Aemon mentions the Prince that was promised as well but makes no mention of Azor Ahai and it seems that Rhaegar first believed he was the prince that was promised to then switch and think that his son by Elia Martell was this prohecized hero. And because Rahegar was an idiot who could bungle a glass of water, he also believed that this was somehow related to the Dragon must have 3 heads prophecy of which we know absolutely nothing at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about the prince that was promised. He was &ldquo;Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star&rdquo; and:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe prince is said to have &ldquo;a song&rdquo;, the song of ice and fire.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>We don&rsquo;t know if Rhaegar also believed the prince that was promised was Azor Ahai so the entire connection between these 2 prophecies seems to come from Melissandre. And again, I wouldn&rsquo;t put much stock in what she thinks because she&rsquo;s a religious fanatic who actually manipulates events to suit the prophecy (having Stannis pull a fake Lightbringer from the flames on Dragonstone) because she really, really wants it to be true.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the prince that was promised is Jon. His is the only story that is linked to both fire and ice. He is the literal product of the song of ice and fire (the son of a Targareyen and a Stark) and his story is connected to both ice and fire through out. He fights against Ice in the form of the White Walkers and he encounters both the false Azor Ahai (Stannis) and now D*ny, who is the person associated the most with fire in the series. If the Dance of Dragons 2.0 and dark D*ny theories become canon, his song of ice and fire would be his titular role in both these great wars that are about to visit Westeros.&nbsp;</p><p>But this is only supposition on my part at the moment because we simply do not have enough information to make an informed guess on this theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, onto Azor Ahai.
