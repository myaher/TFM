Just writing about this moment brings tears to my eyes, and it remains one of my favorite scenes I\u2019ve ever written. <br/><br/>Everything from the 2:00 mark onward makes me cry, makes me think about Aelin punching that iron coffin over and over and over, saved from breaking by her indomitable will and her mother\u2019s undying love.<br/><br/>I also listened to this last minute of music while writing Rowan\u2019s reaction scene\u2014when he feels her power surge into the world, and knows Aelin is still alive\u2014and still fighting like hell.

Ahhhhh!! <a>@sjmaas</a>\u200b ]<br/><br/><i>I\u2019ve drawn inspiration from this piece so many times throughout the series, and I\u2019ve basically come to think of it as Aelin\u2019s/the Galathynius theme. <br/><br/>But I also listened to it during that moment right after Elena is obliterated by the gods, when Aelin and Mala make that last connection/understanding between them, and Aelin decides that she\u2019s not going to be some sacrificial lamb. That she\u2019s going to make the gods pay for everything they\u2019ve done. And then she rips open a portal to a hell-realm as one big FU to them.<br/><br/>(Side note: I also listened to this piece during the Aedion POV scene when things in the Battle of Orynth are going so badly, and Aelin finally arrives, riding the Lord of the North into her home at last.)</i><br/><br/><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=butMdidqqCs\"> \u201cJohn Carter of Mars\u201d by Michael Giacchino from the John Carter soundtrack: </a><br/></b><br/><i>Okay, so just skip ahead to the 7:00 mark and listen to everything from there.

I spent all of KOA worried that it somehow wouldn\u2019t work, or that Aelin would lead me in a totally different direction, but by some miracle, it all came together precisely as I\u2019d hoped, and I literally just sobbed and sobbed and sobbed while writing that final scene and listening to this roughly one minute of music.<br/></i> <br/>+++<br/><br/>From Sarah:<i> Annnnd I know: I\u2019ve barely touched the tip of the iceberg (Manon vs. the Matrons!

Here, the idea of &lsquo;adult&rsquo; content and what it means is relatively broad. In the case of The Raven Cycle, it&rsquo;s mostly about the audience and how that audience alters the available content on the genre level in the long term. Some people have critiqued Six of Crows characters for being too adult in their thinking or abilities, but overall most readers don&rsquo;t seem to care about realism in fantasy YA, per se. So if Kaz talks like an adult and is improbably powerful as a major gang leader, it&rsquo;s more or less OK with both teenagers and adult readers. No, the critique of 'adult&rsquo; readers or content goes three ways: as with the <a href=\"https://vickywhoreads.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/how-ya-isolates-teens/\">original blog post</a> Stiefvater was responding to, one issue is the different needs and monetary resources teenagers have, and the way the industry focuses on adult interests and needs instead. A very valid point. With some YA books like Six of Crows, the problem becomes (at least potentially) the sexualization of Kaz, at least <a href=\"http://krugerevengeinej.tumblr.com/post/182301925870\">according to @krugerevengeinej</a>. To be honest, though, online fandom doesn&rsquo;t get too excited unless it&rsquo;s a question of race representation and/or sexuality, though. When most people say certain YA books are 'too adult&rsquo;, they mean they&rsquo;re too sexual. \n</p><p>\n\nIt&rsquo;s definitely awkward, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m not here to claim Sarah J. Maas&rsquo; books are 'really&rsquo; YA, and you could certainly argue they shouldn&rsquo;t be marketed as such, though it&rsquo;s hardly an issue unique to this one author or even initiated by her individually. Still, you wouldn&rsquo;t argue Aelin can be 'too sexualized&rsquo; by adult readers, even though she&rsquo;s nineteen. She&rsquo;s having plenty of sex, after all. It&rsquo;s easier to talk about Kaz, because he&rsquo;s seventeen and sexually abstinent, so he seems more like a teen at first glance, though I&rsquo;d question that. Both characters are old for their age and have experienced a lot of violence, taken care of themselves from a very young age and suffered extensive personal loss: stuff that is way out of the average teen&rsquo;s experience. It&rsquo;s pretty arguable that the Throne of Glass series is more adult than Six of Crows in any but the sexual content sense. Of course, that&rsquo;s what most people seem to care about, even if one <a href=\"https://star-crossedvoyager.tumblr.com/post/182275787615/we-need-to-talk-about-sjm\">reply to the @sleepingfancies SJM critique</a> mentions that being interested in smut is normal for older teenagers. The idea is that this is the wrong kind, since smut for teens should be educational, I guess? Even though not much else about either series is really educational, in my opinion. And also it&rsquo;s still not properly classified as YA, which is possible but more than likely moot since it&rsquo;s a marketing strategy and not an inherent reflection of the subject matter involved. \n</p><p>\n\nSex is always treated differently, though. It&rsquo;s somehow more important to be educational about sexual mores than other types of morality or ethics, which both Six of Crows and Throne of Glass consistently fail at. Kaz and Inej on the one hand, Aelin, Manon and Rowan on the other&ndash; let&rsquo;s just say, do not do what they do. But no one&rsquo;s concerned with the authors glorifying armed robbery or assassination here. The most common source of fan concern with the changing YA market is about social justice or representation issues and the smut, like I said.  Even if one has to twist the text quite a ways to make it queerbaiting, the logic goes that if we can imagine the subtext and 'symbolism&rsquo;, surely this is proof enough. For example, Manon loved battle, killing men and the taste of blood on her teeth, etc. Surely this means she didn&rsquo;t want to have sex with them, right? I mean, she wouldn&rsquo;t kill women unless they were Crochans&hellip; oh, wait. And of course, passionate friendship between men or women is only believable if it&rsquo;s hinting at a future romance. Not that any this excuses the lack of queer representation, by any means. I&rsquo;m just saying, there&rsquo;s a difference between that and queerbaiting that overly enthusiastic fans may miss. Although I suppose that&rsquo;s just a separate issue and has nothing to do with adulthood or the lack thereof, honestly. \n</p><p>\n\nIn general, I have observed that the protestations about unhealthy relationships happen no matter what, even in response to actual erotica and/or NC-17 fanfiction. It&rsquo;s just so neatly justified and 'obviously&rsquo; relevant with the YA genre. It&rsquo;s extra ironic because Sarah J. Maas goes out of her way to portray an actual abusive relationship with her ACoMAF contrast between Rhys and Tamlin&rsquo;s behavior with Feyre. And of course, even if Rowan is Aelin&rsquo;s mate in the Throne of Glass books, she clearly remains super close to Dorian and Chaol, her earlier love interests. But it&rsquo;s easier to make fun of the educational value of the popular (and common) 'fated mates&rsquo; trope and suppose it&rsquo;s somehow meant to disparage a girl&rsquo;s early relationships, or wonder if twelve-year olds should know about bodily fluids and dirty talking. In general, I think it all comes down to taking words out of context and purposely imagining an audience that doesn&rsquo;t exist. I mean, it seems like most twelve year-olds aren&rsquo;t even reading The Raven Cycle according to Stiefvater&rsquo;s poll, let alone the Throne of Glass books. But they *could*. They could also go looking beyond the YA shelves, as I myself did, but it&rsquo;s the principle of the thing, I suppose. \n</p><p>\n\nAs a teen of thirteen and up, I read smutty romance novels, and it didn&rsquo;t harm me beyond exacerbating my existing tendency to idealize romantic love. I can&rsquo;t imagine the only thing that saved me from trauma is the silly euphemisms and lack of explicit reference to bodily fluids in those books, though I agree that individual teens are all different in terms of their readiness. Those who are ready will seek things out. Those who aren&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t. People wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy a book with a multitude of adult themes and then suddenly get shocked and traumatized by Rhysand being a little too toppy and arrogant about flirting and sex, even though he&rsquo;s actually patient and caring with Feyre in many other ways. Older teenagers lack life experiences, but most are fully capable of reading and understanding such behavioral subtleties. Plus, teen boys in real life are certainly bigger assholes than Rhys and their talk is uglier and/or dirtier, any day of the week. And if these inexperienced or younger teen readers can&rsquo;t make sense of it, they&rsquo;re more likely to be confused or bored than to suddenly change their whole understanding of relationships to reflect this book they&rsquo;re suddenly reading. That takes both a broad trend and some corresponding experience in their real life, as well as a total lack of guidance from the adults in their life. Books aren&rsquo;t so dangerous that any exposure to the 'wrong&rsquo; ideas is somehow tainting. \n</p><p>\n\nThe bottom line is that books don&rsquo;t have the power to brainwash young people (or older people, for that matter). They are more likely to simply seem boring to those who aren&rsquo;t ready or interested in the 'adult&rsquo; content. If there&rsquo;s some reason to keep reading, a book is certainly capable of stretching young minds and eliciting curiosity about all sorts of things, and that includes sexuality. Even if teens often think in black and white terms, good books can stretch their understanding. Reading a bit above one&rsquo;s understanding or experience level is something I&rsquo;d recommend for that reason. Overall, though, both teens and adults are most likely to stick with what they know. People&rsquo;s fiction interests are essentially self-sorting, marketing strategies aside. That&rsquo;s *how* the genre is changing.</p>",

But it\u2019s easier to make fun of the educational value of the popular (and common) 'fated mates\u2019 trope and suppose it\u2019s somehow meant to disparage a girl\u2019s early relationships, or wonder if twelve-year olds should know about bodily fluids and dirty talking. In general, I think it all comes down to taking words out of context and purposely imagining an audience that doesn\u2019t exist.

                "content": "<p>On the one hand, there&rsquo;s the <a href=\"http://mild-lunacy.tumblr.com/post/180315976344/adult-books-for-fans-of-ya\">recent post in reply to Maggie Stiefvater</a>, with the idea that YA as a genre is changing. Here, the idea of &lsquo;adult&rsquo; content and what it means is relatively broad. In the case of The Raven Cycle, it&rsquo;s mostly about the audience and how that audience alters the available content on the genre level in the long term. Some people have critiqued Six of Crows characters for being too adult in their thinking or abilities, but overall most readers don&rsquo;t seem to care about realism in fantasy YA, per se. So if Kaz talks like an adult and is improbably powerful as a major gang leader, it&rsquo;s more or less OK with both teenagers and adult readers. No, the critique of 'adult&rsquo; readers or content goes three ways: as with the <a href=\"https://vickywhoreads.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/how-ya-isolates-teens/\">original blog post</a> Stiefvater was responding to, one issue is the different needs and monetary resources teenagers have, and the way the industry focuses on adult interests and needs instead. A very valid point. With some YA books like Six of Crows, the problem becomes (at least potentially) the sexualization of Kaz, at least <a href=\"http://krugerevengeinej.tumblr.com/post/182301925870\">according to @krugerevengeinej</a>. To be honest, though, online fandom doesn&rsquo;t get too excited unless it&rsquo;s a question of race representation and/or sexuality, though. When most people say certain YA books are 'too adult&rsquo;, they mean they&rsquo;re too sexual. \n</p><p>\n\nIt&rsquo;s definitely awkward, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m not here to claim Sarah J. Maas&rsquo; books are 'really&rsquo; YA, and you could certainly argue they shouldn&rsquo;t be marketed as such, though it&rsquo;s hardly an issue unique to this one author or even initiated by her individually. Still, you wouldn&rsquo;t argue Aelin can be 'too sexualized&rsquo; by adult readers, even though she&rsquo;s nineteen. She&rsquo;s having plenty of sex, after all. It&rsquo;s easier to talk about Kaz, because he&rsquo;s seventeen and sexually abstinent, so he seems more like a teen at first glance, though I&rsquo;d question that. Both characters are old for their age and have experienced a lot of violence, taken care of themselves from a very young age and suffered extensive personal loss: stuff that is way out of the average teen&rsquo;s experience. It&rsquo;s pretty arguable that the Throne of Glass series is more adult than Six of Crows in any but the sexual content sense. Of course, that&rsquo;s what most people seem to care about, even if one <a href=\"https://star-crossedvoyager.tumblr.com/post/182275787615/we-need-to-talk-about-sjm\">reply to the @sleepingfancies SJM critique</a> mentions that being interested in smut is normal for older teenagers. The idea is that this is the wrong kind, since smut for teens should be educational, I guess? Even though not much else about either series is really educational, in my opinion. And also it&rsquo;s still not properly classified as YA, which is possible but more than likely moot since it&rsquo;s a marketing strategy and not an inherent reflection of the subject matter involved. \n</p><p>\n\nSex is always treated differently, though. It&rsquo;s somehow more important to be educational about sexual mores than other types of morality or ethics, which both Six of Crows and Throne of Glass consistently fail at. Kaz and Inej on the one hand, Aelin, Manon and Rowan on the other&ndash; let&rsquo;s just say, do not do what they do. But no one&rsquo;s concerned with the authors glorifying armed robbery or assassination here. The most common source of fan concern with the changing YA market is about social justice or representation issues and the smut, like I said.  Even if one has to twist the text quite a ways to make it queerbaiting, the logic goes that if we can imagine the subtext and 'symbolism&rsquo;, surely this is proof enough. For example, Manon loved battle, killing men and the taste of blood on her teeth, etc. Surely this means she didn&rsquo;t want to have sex with them, right? I mean, she wouldn&rsquo;t kill women unless they were Crochans&hellip; oh, wait. And of course, passionate friendship between men or women is only believable if it&rsquo;s hinting at a future romance. Not that any this excuses the lack of queer representation, by any means. I&rsquo;m just saying, there&rsquo;s a difference between that and queerbaiting that overly enthusiastic fans may miss. Although I suppose that&rsquo;s just a separate issue and has nothing to do with adulthood or the lack thereof, honestly. \n</p><p>\n\nIn general, I have observed that the protestations about unhealthy relationships happen no matter what, even in response to actual erotica and/or NC-17 fanfiction. It&rsquo;s just so neatly justified and 'obviously&rsquo; relevant with the YA genre. It&rsquo;s extra ironic because Sarah J. Maas goes out of her way to portray an actual abusive relationship with her ACoMAF contrast between Rhys and Tamlin&rsquo;s behavior with Feyre. And of course, even if Rowan is Aelin&rsquo;s mate in the Throne of Glass books, she clearly remains super close to Dorian and Chaol, her earlier love interests.

In general, I think it all comes down to taking words out of context and purposely imagining an audience that doesn&rsquo;t exist.
