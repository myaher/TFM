While I\u2019ve largely gotten over my general aversion to sports anime (watch Haikyuu!! guys), I wasn\u2019t sure if that would extend to a sport I find even less appealing than most. However, I gave Megalobox a chance, and I\u2019m glad I did because it ended up easily being one of the best anime of the year.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e38d52cbe74e9d8bd9f2e0b61d58a461/tumblr_inline_pkxjibfLgq1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>The first thing that jumps out about Megalobox is its incredible aesthetic. Megalobox is a strikingly good-looking series with incredibly detailed backgrounds and strong, unique character designs that give the show an incredible sense of realism, immersing the viewer in its world. The stark difference between the dull grit of the slums and the sleek elegance of Megalonia does more too show the class divide between these two worlds than any dialogue ever could. The animation is also fantastically dynamic bringing the boxing bouts to life, making them a consistently exciting watch. And the visuals are topped off by an excellent musical score to bring this show to life. Even if it had nothing else, Megalobox could run on sheer aesthetics alone.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0cfd352512667bc41fde9ec412a02b57/tumblr_inline_pkxjkePWT31tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>Of course, aesthetics aren\u2019t the only thing Megalobox has to offer. Its narrative is a familiar one- the underdog fighter who slowly works his way up the ranks to victory. But just because a story is familiar doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad and Megalobox executes its story with a cool confidence that sucks the viewer in. It\u2019s easy to get invested in this classic underdog story rooted in contrasting social classes, especially in the moments when it dips into surprisingly dark and heavy material- episode 5 is a particular stand-out, focusing on the military past between two characters that left both mentally and physically traumatised making for a deeply harrowing episode.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56d5d17cf24b3b5f81795e58be10684e/tumblr_inline_pl04b7flsi1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>The characters help a lot too. Main character \u201cgearless\u201d Joe is easy to root for in his desire to make it to the top, and for the audience to worry about given that he\u2019s reckless to the point of self-destruction. His main rival Yuri is also appealing. Rather than a one-dimensional villain, he views Joe as a worthy opponent who he wants to take on head-to-head on fair terms. Perhaps the most developed character is Joe\u2019s trainer Nanbu, whose outer layer of cynicism hides a strong desire to live in a more idealistic world. My personal favourite character was the Megalobox sponsor Yukiko, who initially comes of as a cold professional but as times goes on is shown to have a strong moral centre. Megalobox\u2019s general lack of one-dimensional villains is a particular strength- even those placed in an antagonistic role generally have strong motivations for being who they are. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2215239e6105ed788668e3317cae672c/tumblr_inline_pl04ceDU8f1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>Overall Megalobox stands as a show that I wasn\u2019t sure if I should watch or not, but I\u2019m very glad I gave it a chance because it ended up being one of the most thoroughly enjoyable experiences of the year.</p><p><b>2.\u00a0Aggressive Retsuko</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"800\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5a7f162be056f4437442f67abcc749a/tumblr_inline_pl0dxfVlau1tvspuw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"800\"/></figure><p>I\u2019m kind of cheating by putting Aggretsuko on this list. Typically I restrict my end of year list purely to tv anime and as an OVA short Aggretsuko kinds of falls outside that category. But if anything this year deserves a spot on my best-of list it\u2019s Aggretsuko which was far and away one of the most enjoyable experiences of the year. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/86d58b5fcdb6b49faa35eaec5df32ea0/tumblr_inline_pl0dy2xRGd1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>The first and most noticeable thing about Aggretsuko is how incredibly #relatable it is. There are few other shows that so powerfully capture the feeling of being an exhausted millennial, trying to make it through your daily life dealing with alarm clocks, demanding bosses and overbearing retail employees. It\u2019s a uniquely accurate portrayal of being the average working person in late-stage capitalism, and many people watching might find themselves feeling that the exhausted protagonist\u2019s struggles hit almost too close to home.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dff963462fbcdd266a26d0c174a2c46e/tumblr_inline_pl0dz3z5ji1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>It also helps that so many of the characters of the show are both entertaining and appealing, even aside from our relatable protagonist Retsuko. My personal favourite was Retsuko\u2019s friend Fenneko who seems to run on pure spite as a way to deal with the difficulties of adulthood. But adding to the cast are characters such as Kabae the gossipy office lady who may or may not be a corporate spy, too-cheerful Tsunoda who sucks up to the bosses and has an ongoing rivalry with Fenneko and finally the office ladies Washimi and Gori, who on the surface seem to have it all put together but who under the surface may be as big a mess as the rest of the cast. All the characters in the show are remarkably entertaining and a constant treat to watch. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/857e04739bcacf882f4426407f500b05/tumblr_inline_pl0dzlLgn81tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>One particular way this show shines is how is addresses workplace issues that face women specifically. A big part of the show is focused around Retsuko dealing with the harassment she receives from her boss, a literal chauvinist big, and the show&rsquo;s primary antagonist. It\u2019s a testament to Aggretsuko\u2019s skilled storytelling that it allows the situation to be difficult to solve- a common refrain in these situations is \u2018why didn\u2019t she just report it?\u2019 But Aggretsuko shows how difficult that can be to do, and that the threat of retaliation is very real and present and difficult to work around. There are a lot of ways a bad boss can make an employees life hell even while technically not breaking any rules and Aggretsuko understands this implicitly.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b85fc90fd374a561f52edaa3b3b96d4/tumblr_inline_pl0e02m2oN1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>A final thing I particularly appreciated about Aggretsuko is its treatment of romantic relationships, which is something I rarely see explored in fiction. As a way of dealing with her workplace struggles, Retsuko throws herself into her first love, believing that the happiness of a relationship will solve all her problems, regardless of the fact that the addition of a romantic relationship will have no effect on her workplace issues or the fact that her new boyfriend is terribly inconsiderate. \u201cLove fixes everything\u2019 is an enduring and deeply misguided common trait in fiction and I enjoyed that Aggretsuko chooses to challenge it. Not just in it\u2019s handling of Retsuko\u2019s romantic relationship, but also with her male friend Haida who has a crush on her and admits that it may blind him to who she is, but that he would like the chance to get to know the real her. It\u2019s an extremely healthy take on romantic relationships and one that I would appreciate seeing more of in fiction.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b38254210a03d881c2f37eef67461dc/tumblr_inline_pl0e0kvR4o1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"/></figure><p>Aggretsuko wasn\u2019t a show I had eyes on before it aired, but I\u2019m very happy I watched it. It\u2019s a show that just about anyone could enjoy regardless of whether they\u2019re an anime fan or not and one of the most relatable shows of the year. It\u2019s remarkable how much this little show was able to achieve in just 10 short episodes, and I\u2019m very much looking forward to the second season.</p><p><b>1. Planet With</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4eef88e3ef4950264adaaaf6af9e56b7/tumblr_inline_pl0eb3OBXj1tvspuw_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>There are a few shows on this list that were unexpected, but Planet With may have been the biggest unexpected surprise of them all. This show went from being completely not on my radar at all to being my absolute best of the year. There have been years where I&rsquo;ve struggled to pick an unambiguous top show, but 2018 was not one of them. I knew from the minute Planet With finished that it would be tough for any other show to top it and I wasn\u2019t wrong. Planet With stands strong as not just my favourite show of the year but as a strong addition to my favourite shows of all time.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3928c97522b7ac6bd395eeed83377954/tumblr_inline_pl0ebuoOsx1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>The first thing that grabbed my attention about Planet With was the way it messed with traditional ideas of heroism and villainy. Planet With\u2019s immediate themes and plot are based on the Super Sentai genre of long-running episodic shows with colourfully themed superheroes fighting against evil, and while I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with the Super Sentai genre, I am a long time fan of its female counterpart, magical girl shows. Planet With immediately sets up expectations with a team of heroic fighters coming in to save the day, but they aren\u2019t the main protagonists of the piece- an odd, mysterious team fighting to steal their powers are our real protagonists. I\u2019m always a fan of shows that seek to challenge our ideas of heroes vs villains and good vs evil so Planet With immediately captured my attention on that front. After all, as most audiences know the villains are often the most interesting characters in a show. \u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/de98ada2ea395d288ccfb604a8ecc71b/tumblr_inline_pl0ecas28s1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>But Planet With doesn\u2019t just stop there. It\u2019s one thing to set up an initial subversion of heroes vs villains, it\u2019s another thing to follow through on that with well-delivered themes and ideas. One of Planet With\u2019s greatest strengths is its complex web of character motivations and goals. No side feels too clearly right or wrong in Planet With, and all have strong motives for what they do outside the narrowly defined lines of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d even if the show ultimately disagrees with their goals. Are optimism and hope right or are they naivety that will lead to destruction? Is it right to impose your will on others if that will present tragedy? Is a species growth worth supporting even if that growth may go in a dangerous direction? Planet With asks many difficult questions from many different points of view. In fact, one of the strongest scenes of the show occurs when two of its antagonists fight and point out the flaws in each other\u2019s ideologies, both of which the show ultimately rejects. It\u2019s fascinating how much meat Planet With is able to get out of what could be a simple clash of good against evil.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70d8b38917b1e4eaf31bda85b219e0c7/tumblr_inline_pl0ecxuWPS1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>Given the richness of its themes it should be no surprise that Planet With\u2019s characters are also rich and engaging. The main character Soya is an amnesiac antihero living with a maid-outfit wearing woman called Ginko and a giant space cat known as Sensei. The three of them form an unlikely and surprisingly touching domesticity, and all three have their own pasts and goals. The side characters are no less appealing- it\u2019s amazing how much characterisation Planet With is able to pact into its relatively large cast given its limited runtime. Each of the Grand Paladin warriors, in particular, gets a moment in the spotlight, and all their stories are legitimately interesting and often tear-inducing. The villains of the piece are also interesting and even likeable in their own right, with sympathetic goals and ideals even when they\u2019re in an antagonistic role.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f65f5ebe1eec7ae4d2adbc13e0f24c4b/tumblr_inline_pl0edgLewu1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>But perhaps the strongest thing about Planet With is that much of its themes ultimately boil down to the power of joy and empathy to make the universe a better place and to fight fear and authoritarian ideals. Planet With believes earnestly and firmly in the power of positive thinking and in the benefits of compassion and forgiveness. Planet With isn\u2019t a naive show, it acknowledges humanities flaws, but it believes we have the potential to work past them and love one another. In a tumultuous world sometimes empathy for one another can be both the most difficult and most important thing. Or as the show itself says \u201cit is a far greater thing than justice to witness the harshness of the world and still remain kind.\u201d \u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7b3f1c37a642a11758ef2ef5ebf1499/tumblr_inline_pl0ednibFl1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>Planet With is a show like none other, packing a full 50 episodes worth of story and themes into just 12 episodes. The show made me tear up more than once, and by the time it was over I felt both fully satisfied and desperate to experience it all over again. It\u2019s a deeply underrated show that I\u2019m sure many people this year missed out on- and if you\u2019re one of those people give it a shot. It\u2019s undeniably the most worthwhile show of the year.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181718973497/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">(part one)</a> <a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181751090277/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">(part two)</a></b><a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181751090277/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">\n\n</a><br/></p></blockquote>",

No side feels too clearly right or wrong in Planet With, and all have strong motives for what they do outside the narrowly defined lines of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d even if the show ultimately disagrees with their goals. Are optimism and hope right or are they naivety that will lead to destruction? Is it right to impose your will on others if that will present tragedy?

In fact, one of the strongest scenes of the show occurs when two of its antagonists fight and point out the flaws in each other\u2019s ideologies, both of which the show ultimately rejects. It\u2019s fascinating how much meat Planet With is able to get out of what could be a simple clash of good against evil.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70d8b38917b1e4eaf31bda85b219e0c7/tumblr_inline_pl0ecxuWPS1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Given the richness of its themes it should be no surprise that Planet With\u2019s characters are also rich and engaging. The main character Soya is an amnesiac antihero living with a maid-outfit wearing woman called Ginko and a giant space cat known as Sensei. The three of them form an unlikely and surprisingly touching domesticity, and all three have their own pasts and goals. The side characters are no less appealing- it\u2019s amazing how much characterisation Planet With is able to pact into its relatively large cast given its limited runtime. Each of the Grand Paladin warriors, in particular, gets a moment in the spotlight, and all their stories are legitimately interesting and often tear-inducing. The villains of the piece are also interesting and even likeable in their own right, with sympathetic goals and ideals even when they\u2019re in an antagonistic role.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f65f5ebe1eec7ae4d2adbc13e0f24c4b/tumblr_inline_pl0edgLewu1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>But perhaps the strongest thing about Planet With is that much of its themes ultimately boil down to the power of joy and empathy to make the universe a better place and to fight fear and authoritarian ideals. Planet With believes earnestly and firmly in the power of positive thinking and in the benefits of compassion and forgiveness. Planet With isn\u2019t a naive show, it acknowledges humanities flaws, but it believes we have the potential to work past them and love one another. In a tumultuous world sometimes empathy for one another can be both the most difficult and most important thing. Or as the show itself says \u201cit is a far greater thing than justice to witness the harshness of the world and still remain kind.\u201d \u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7b3f1c37a642a11758ef2ef5ebf1499/tumblr_inline_pl0ednibFl1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Planet With is a show like none other, packing a full 50 episodes worth of story and themes into just 12 episodes. The show made me tear up more than once, and by the time it was over I felt both fully satisfied and desperate to experience it all over again. It\u2019s a deeply underrated show that I\u2019m sure many people this year missed out on- and if you\u2019re one of those people give it a shot. It\u2019s undeniably the most worthwhile show of the year.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181718973497/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">(part one)</a> <a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181751090277/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">(part two)</a></b><a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181751090277/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">\n\n</a><br></p></blockquote></p>",

While I\u2019ve largely gotten over my general aversion to sports anime (watch Haikyuu!! guys), I wasn\u2019t sure if that would extend to a sport I find even less appealing than most. However, I gave Megalobox a chance, and I\u2019m glad I did because it ended up easily being one of the best anime of the year.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e38d52cbe74e9d8bd9f2e0b61d58a461/tumblr_inline_pkxjibfLgq1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>The first thing that jumps out about Megalobox is its incredible aesthetic. Megalobox is a strikingly good-looking series with incredibly detailed backgrounds and strong, unique character designs that give the show an incredible sense of realism, immersing the viewer in its world. The stark difference between the dull grit of the slums and the sleek elegance of Megalonia does more too show the class divide between these two worlds than any dialogue ever could. The animation is also fantastically dynamic bringing the boxing bouts to life, making them a consistently exciting watch. And the visuals are topped off by an excellent musical score to bring this show to life. Even if it had nothing else, Megalobox could run on sheer aesthetics alone.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0cfd352512667bc41fde9ec412a02b57/tumblr_inline_pkxjkePWT31tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>Of course, aesthetics aren\u2019t the only thing Megalobox has to offer. Its narrative is a familiar one- the underdog fighter who slowly works his way up the ranks to victory. But just because a story is familiar doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad and Megalobox executes its story with a cool confidence that sucks the viewer in. It\u2019s easy to get invested in this classic underdog story rooted in contrasting social classes, especially in the moments when it dips into surprisingly dark and heavy material- episode 5 is a particular stand-out, focusing on the military past between two characters that left both mentally and physically traumatised making for a deeply harrowing episode.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56d5d17cf24b3b5f81795e58be10684e/tumblr_inline_pl04b7flsi1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>The characters help a lot too. Main character \u201cgearless\u201d Joe is easy to root for in his desire to make it to the top, and for the audience to worry about given that he\u2019s reckless to the point of self-destruction. His main rival Yuri is also appealing. Rather than a one-dimensional villain, he views Joe as a worthy opponent who he wants to take on head-to-head on fair terms. Perhaps the most developed character is Joe\u2019s trainer Nanbu, whose outer layer of cynicism hides a strong desire to live in a more idealistic world. My personal favourite character was the Megalobox sponsor Yukiko, who initially comes of as a cold professional but as times goes on is shown to have a strong moral centre. Megalobox\u2019s general lack of one-dimensional villains is a particular strength- even those placed in an antagonistic role generally have strong motivations for being who they are. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2215239e6105ed788668e3317cae672c/tumblr_inline_pl04ceDU8f1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>Overall Megalobox stands as a show that I wasn\u2019t sure if I should watch or not, but I\u2019m very glad I gave it a chance because it ended up being one of the most thoroughly enjoyable experiences of the year.</p><p><b>2.\u00a0Aggressive Retsuko</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"800\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5a7f162be056f4437442f67abcc749a/tumblr_inline_pl0dxfVlau1tvspuw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"800\"></figure><p>I\u2019m kind of cheating by putting Aggretsuko on this list. Typically I restrict my end of year list purely to tv anime and as an OVA short Aggretsuko kinds of falls outside that category. But if anything this year deserves a spot on my best-of list it\u2019s Aggretsuko which was far and away one of the most enjoyable experiences of the year. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/86d58b5fcdb6b49faa35eaec5df32ea0/tumblr_inline_pl0dy2xRGd1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>The first and most noticeable thing about Aggretsuko is how incredibly #relatable it is. There are few other shows that so powerfully capture the feeling of being an exhausted millennial, trying to make it through your daily life dealing with alarm clocks, demanding bosses and overbearing retail employees. It\u2019s a uniquely accurate portrayal of being the average working person in late-stage capitalism, and many people watching might find themselves feeling that the exhausted protagonist\u2019s struggles hit almost too close to home.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dff963462fbcdd266a26d0c174a2c46e/tumblr_inline_pl0dz3z5ji1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>It also helps that so many of the characters of the show are both entertaining and appealing, even aside from our relatable protagonist Retsuko. My personal favourite was Retsuko\u2019s friend Fenneko who seems to run on pure spite as a way to deal with the difficulties of adulthood. But adding to the cast are characters such as Kabae the gossipy office lady who may or may not be a corporate spy, too-cheerful Tsunoda who sucks up to the bosses and has an ongoing rivalry with Fenneko and finally the office ladies Washimi and Gori, who on the surface seem to have it all put together but who under the surface may be as big a mess as the rest of the cast. All the characters in the show are remarkably entertaining and a constant treat to watch. \u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/857e04739bcacf882f4426407f500b05/tumblr_inline_pl0dzlLgn81tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>One particular way this show shines is how is addresses workplace issues that face women specifically. A big part of the show is focused around Retsuko dealing with the harassment she receives from her boss, a literal chauvinist big, and the show\u2019s primary antagonist. It\u2019s a testament to Aggretsuko\u2019s skilled storytelling that it allows the situation to be difficult to solve- a common refrain in these situations is \u2018why didn\u2019t she just report it?\u2019 But Aggretsuko shows how difficult that can be to do, and that the threat of retaliation is very real and present and difficult to work around. There are a lot of ways a bad boss can make an employees life hell even while technically not breaking any rules and Aggretsuko understands this implicitly.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b85fc90fd374a561f52edaa3b3b96d4/tumblr_inline_pl0e02m2oN1tvspuw_1280.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\"></figure><p>A final thing I particularly appreciated about Aggretsuko is its treatment of romantic relationships, which is something I rarely see explored in fiction.

The side characters are no less appealing- it\u2019s amazing how much characterisation Planet With is able to pact into its relatively large cast given its limited runtime. Each of the Grand Paladin warriors, in particular, gets a moment in the spotlight, and all their stories are legitimately interesting and often tear-inducing. The villains of the piece are also interesting and even likeable in their own right, with sympathetic goals and ideals even when they\u2019re in an antagonistic role.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f65f5ebe1eec7ae4d2adbc13e0f24c4b/tumblr_inline_pl0edgLewu1tvspuw_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>But perhaps the strongest thing about Planet With is that much of its themes ultimately boil down to the power of joy and empathy to make the universe a better place and to fight fear and authoritarian ideals.

The show made me tear up more than once, and by the time it was over I felt both fully satisfied and desperate to experience it all over again. It\u2019s a deeply underrated show that I\u2019m sure many people this year missed out on- and if you\u2019re one of those people give it a shot. It\u2019s undeniably the most worthwhile show of the year.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n<b><a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181718973497/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">(part one)</a> <a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181751090277/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">(part two)</a></b><a href=\"http://the-moonlight-witch.tumblr.com/post/181751090277/the-moonlight-witchs-top-10-anime-of-2018-part\">\n\n</a><br></p></blockquote></p>",
                "content": "<p><p><b>3.&nbsp;Megalobox</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdd6c3c61d272eb753b901b938d7f643/tumblr_inline_pkxiwx4kkG1tvspuw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Megalobox is a show I was cautiously anticipating before it&rsquo;s airing. While I&rsquo;ve largely gotten over my general aversion to sports anime (watch Haikyuu!! guys), I wasn&rsquo;t sure if that would extend to a sport I find even less appealing than most. However, I gave Megalobox a chance, and I&rsquo;m glad I did because it ended up easily being one of the best anime of the year.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e38d52cbe74e9d8bd9f2e0b61d58a461/tumblr_inline_pkxjibfLgq1tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The first thing that jumps out about Megalobox is its incredible aesthetic. Megalobox is a strikingly good-looking series with incredibly detailed backgrounds and strong, unique character designs that give the show an incredible sense of realism, immersing the viewer in its world. The stark difference between the dull grit of the slums and the sleek elegance of Megalonia does more too show the class divide between these two worlds than any dialogue ever could. The animation is also fantastically dynamic bringing the boxing bouts to life, making them a consistently exciting watch. And the visuals are topped off by an excellent musical score to bring this show to life. Even if it had nothing else, Megalobox could run on sheer aesthetics alone.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0cfd352512667bc41fde9ec412a02b57/tumblr_inline_pkxjkePWT31tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Of course, aesthetics aren&rsquo;t the only thing Megalobox has to offer. Its narrative is a familiar one- the underdog fighter who slowly works his way up the ranks to victory. But just because a story is familiar doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad and Megalobox executes its story with a cool confidence that sucks the viewer in. It&rsquo;s easy to get invested in this classic underdog story rooted in contrasting social classes, especially in the moments when it dips into surprisingly dark and heavy material- episode 5 is a particular stand-out, focusing on the military past between two characters that left both mentally and physically traumatised making for a deeply harrowing episode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/56d5d17cf24b3b5f81795e58be10684e/tumblr_inline_pl04b7flsi1tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The characters help a lot too. Main character &ldquo;gearless&rdquo; Joe is easy to root for in his desire to make it to the top, and for the audience to worry about given that he&rsquo;s reckless to the point of self-destruction. His main rival Yuri is also appealing. Rather than a one-dimensional villain, he views Joe as a worthy opponent who he wants to take on head-to-head on fair terms. Perhaps the most developed character is Joe&rsquo;s trainer Nanbu, whose outer layer of cynicism hides a strong desire to live in a more idealistic world. My personal favourite character was the Megalobox sponsor Yukiko, who initially comes of as a cold professional but as times goes on is shown to have a strong moral centre. Megalobox&rsquo;s general lack of one-dimensional villains is a particular strength- even those placed in an antagonistic role generally have strong motivations for being who they are. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2215239e6105ed788668e3317cae672c/tumblr_inline_pl04ceDU8f1tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Overall Megalobox stands as a show that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should watch or not, but I&rsquo;m very glad I gave it a chance because it ended up being one of the most thoroughly enjoyable experiences of the year.</p><p><b>2.&nbsp;Aggressive Retsuko</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5a7f162be056f4437442f67abcc749a/tumblr_inline_pl0dxfVlau1tvspuw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I&rsquo;m kind of cheating by putting Aggretsuko on this list. Typically I restrict my end of year list purely to tv anime and as an OVA short Aggretsuko kinds of falls outside that category. But if anything this year deserves a spot on my best-of list it&rsquo;s Aggretsuko which was far and away one of the most enjoyable experiences of the year. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/86d58b5fcdb6b49faa35eaec5df32ea0/tumblr_inline_pl0dy2xRGd1tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The first and most noticeable thing about Aggretsuko is how incredibly #relatable it is. There are few other shows that so powerfully capture the feeling of being an exhausted millennial, trying to make it through your daily life dealing with alarm clocks, demanding bosses and overbearing retail employees. It&rsquo;s a uniquely accurate portrayal of being the average working person in late-stage capitalism, and many people watching might find themselves feeling that the exhausted protagonist&rsquo;s struggles hit almost too close to home.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dff963462fbcdd266a26d0c174a2c46e/tumblr_inline_pl0dz3z5ji1tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It also helps that so many of the characters of the show are both entertaining and appealing, even aside from our relatable protagonist Retsuko. My personal favourite was Retsuko&rsquo;s friend Fenneko who seems to run on pure spite as a way to deal with the difficulties of adulthood. But adding to the cast are characters such as Kabae the gossipy office lady who may or may not be a corporate spy, too-cheerful Tsunoda who sucks up to the bosses and has an ongoing rivalry with Fenneko and finally the office ladies Washimi and Gori, who on the surface seem to have it all put together but who under the surface may be as big a mess as the rest of the cast. All the characters in the show are remarkably entertaining and a constant treat to watch. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/857e04739bcacf882f4426407f500b05/tumblr_inline_pl0dzlLgn81tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>One particular way this show shines is how is addresses workplace issues that face women specifically. A big part of the show is focused around Retsuko dealing with the harassment she receives from her boss, a literal chauvinist big, and the show&rsquo;s primary antagonist. It&rsquo;s a testament to Aggretsuko&rsquo;s skilled storytelling that it allows the situation to be difficult to solve- a common refrain in these situations is &lsquo;why didn&rsquo;t she just report it?&rsquo; But Aggretsuko shows how difficult that can be to do, and that the threat of retaliation is very real and present and difficult to work around. There are a lot of ways a bad boss can make an employees life hell even while technically not breaking any rules and Aggretsuko understands this implicitly.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b85fc90fd374a561f52edaa3b3b96d4/tumblr_inline_pl0e02m2oN1tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A final thing I particularly appreciated about Aggretsuko is its treatment of romantic relationships, which is something I rarely see explored in fiction. As a way of dealing with her workplace struggles, Retsuko throws herself into her first love, believing that the happiness of a relationship will solve all her problems, regardless of the fact that the addition of a romantic relationship will have no effect on her workplace issues or the fact that her new boyfriend is terribly inconsiderate. &ldquo;Love fixes everything&rsquo; is an enduring and deeply misguided common trait in fiction and I enjoyed that Aggretsuko chooses to challenge it. Not just in it&rsquo;s handling of Retsuko&rsquo;s romantic relationship, but also with her male friend Haida who has a crush on her and admits that it may blind him to who she is, but that he would like the chance to get to know the real her. It&rsquo;s an extremely healthy take on romantic relationships and one that I would appreciate seeing more of in fiction.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b38254210a03d881c2f37eef67461dc/tumblr_inline_pl0e0kvR4o1tvspuw_1280.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Aggretsuko wasn&rsquo;t a show I had eyes on before it aired, but I&rsquo;m very happy I watched it. It&rsquo;s a show that just about anyone could enjoy regardless of whether they&rsquo;re an anime fan or not and one of the most relatable shows of the year. It&rsquo;s remarkable how much this little show was able to achieve in just 10 short episodes, and I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the second season.</p><p><b>1. Planet With</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4eef88e3ef4950264adaaaf6af9e56b7/tumblr_inline_pl0eb3OBXj1tvspuw_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There are a few shows on this list that were unexpected, but Planet With may have been the biggest unexpected surprise of them all. This show went from being completely not on my radar at all to being my absolute best of the year. There have been years where I&rsquo;ve struggled to pick an unambiguous top show, but 2018 was not one of them. I knew from the minute Planet With finished that it would be tough for any other show to top it and I wasn&rsquo;t wrong. Planet With stands strong as not just my favourite show of the year but as a strong addition to my favourite shows of all time.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3928c97522b7ac6bd395eeed83377954/tumblr_inline_pl0ebuoOsx1tvspuw_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The first thing that grabbed my attention about Planet With was the way it messed with traditional ideas of heroism and villainy. Planet With&rsquo;s immediate themes and plot are based on the Super Sentai genre of long-running episodic shows with colourfully themed superheroes fighting against evil, and while I don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with the Super Sentai genre, I am a long time fan of its female counterpart, magical girl shows. Planet With immediately sets up expectations with a team of heroic fighters coming in to save the day, but they aren&rsquo;t the main protagonists of the piece- an odd, mysterious team fighting to steal their powers are our real protagonists. I&rsquo;m always a fan of shows that seek to challenge our ideas of heroes vs villains and good vs evil so Planet With immediately captured my attention on that front. After all, as most audiences know the villains are often the most interesting characters in a show. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/de98ada2ea395d288ccfb604a8ecc71b/tumblr_inline_pl0ecas28s1tvspuw_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But Planet With doesn&rsquo;t just stop there. It&rsquo;s one thing to set up an initial subversion of heroes vs villains, it&rsquo;s another thing to follow through on that with well-delivered themes and ideas. One of Planet With&rsquo;s greatest strengths is its complex web of character motivations and goals. No side feels too clearly right or wrong in Planet With, and all have strong motives for what they do outside the narrowly defined lines of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil&rdquo; even if the show ultimately disagrees with their goals. Are optimism and hope right or are they naivety that will lead to destruction? Is it right to impose your will on others if that will present tragedy? Is a species growth worth supporting even if that growth may go in a dangerous direction? Planet With asks many difficult questions from many different points of view. In fact, one of the strongest scenes of the show occurs when two of its antagonists fight and point out the flaws in each other&rsquo;s ideologies, both of which the show ultimately rejects. It&rsquo;s fascinating how much meat Planet With is able to get out of what could be a simple clash of good against evil.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70d8b38917b1e4eaf31bda85b219e0c7/tumblr_inline_pl0ecxuWPS1tvspuw_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Given the richness of its themes it should be no surprise that Planet With&rsquo;s characters are also rich and engaging. The main character Soya is an amnesiac antihero living with a maid-outfit wearing woman called Ginko and a giant space cat known as Sensei. The three of them form an unlikely and surprisingly touching domesticity, and all three have their own pasts and goals. The side characters are no less appealing- it&rsquo;s amazing how much characterisation Planet With is able to pact into its relatively large cast given its limited runtime. Each of the Grand Paladin warriors, in particular, gets a moment in the spotlight, and all their stories are legitimately interesting and often tear-inducing. The villains of the piece are also interesting and even likeable in their own right, with sympathetic goals and ideals even when they&rsquo;re in an antagonistic role.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f65f5ebe1eec7ae4d2adbc13e0f24c4b/tumblr_inline_pl0edgLewu1tvspuw_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But perhaps the strongest thing about Planet With is that much of its themes ultimately boil down to the power of joy and empathy to make the universe a better place and to fight fear and authoritarian ideals. Planet With believes earnestly and firmly in the power of positive thinking and in the benefits of compassion and forgiveness. Planet With isn&rsquo;t a naive show, it acknowledges humanities flaws, but it believes we have the potential to work past them and love one another. In a tumultuous world sometimes empathy for one another can be both the most difficult and most important thing. Or as the show itself says &ldquo;it is a far greater thing than justice to witness the harshness of the world and still remain kind.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7b3f1c37a642a11758ef2ef5ebf1499/tumblr_inline_pl0ednibFl1tvspuw_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Planet With is a show like none other, packing a full 50 episodes worth of story and themes into just 12 episodes.
