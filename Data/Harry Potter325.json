I don\u2019t blame you for what you did and I don\u2019t blame Barty for how he reacted, but I do blame James. He knew you were taken and yet still put on his flirting, teasing, and taunting demeanor that is a signature James thing and honestly in that situation I probably would have kissed him to shut him up too.
