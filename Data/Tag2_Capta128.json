Fury calls him \u201cthe new guy\u201d and doesn\u2019t know him that well yet, but there is a moment that explains why Fury trusts and respects him from the beginning, and why Coulson will later become his chosen successor.</li><li>The computerized de-aging technique is done really well, almost distractingly so. One drawback is that it doesn\u2019t allow for a lot of expression on Clark\u2019s part, although when you think back to how Phil was when we first met him in the MCU, he wasn\u2019t super expressive anyway, so it fits the character I guess.</li><li>Coulson doesn\u2019t meet any blue-skinned Kree face to face in the movie, but it\u2019s reasonable to speculate that Fury will fill in the details about them, and the Skrulls as well, at some point.</li><li>There isn\u2019t anything in the movie that specifically rules out the Skrull theory in S6. The rules for the MCU Skrulls (as established in the movie) are:\u00a0</li></ul><ol><li>They have to see someone to copy them.\u00a0</li><li>They can match a person\u2019s DNA, fingerprints, and most biological data, so there\u2019s no way to physically tell them apart.\u00a0</li><li>It takes a combination of practice and talent to be really good at it.\u00a0</li><li>Probably most importantly, Skrulls can retain short-term memories, but not long-term ones. So if a Skrull saw Coulson in a non-SHIELD context, the organization might not be in the double\u2019s memory.\u00a0</li><li>On the other hand, they are supposed to be skilled at infiltration, so it\u2019s hard to believe they wouldn\u2019t have at least heard of SHIELD if they\u2019ve spent any time on Earth.\u00a0</li></ol><ul><li>Personally, I don\u2019t buy the theory, but I do find it interesting. Since we\u2019ve had plenty of Kree on the show now, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Skrulls appeared at some point. Just because the writers like to keep us <strike>miserable</strike> guessing.</li></ul><p>That\u2019s all for now! If you have any more questions that I can answer (publicly or privately), send an ask.</p>",
