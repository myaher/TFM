I\u2019m going to forgive you for not texting me, even\nthough I\u2019ve been wondering where you\u2019ve been, because wow. Who the HELL ARE\nTHOSE GUYS?\u201d Remi\u2019s eyes were practically bulging out of her head, and you\ncould see her face reddening as realization continued to seep in. \u201cYou just\nwaltz into here like it\u2019s completely normal that you\u2019re with four strange\ndudes, sorry, four <i>extremely hot</i>\nstrange dudes.

MY OWN BEST FRIEND.\u201d You wiggled free from her grasp and\ngrabbed her shoulders.\u00a0<br/>\u201cDeep breath girl, I know, I didn\u2019t want to spring them on you like this, but\nit\u2019s been a DAY. I made a fool out of myself in class this morning, and Jimin\nwanted me to hang out, and I couldn\u2019t just say no to him, YOU SEE THESE MEN.\nYOU SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. I COULDN\u2019T JUST SAY NO.\u201d The intense whispers\nbetween you and Remi were starting to concern the surrounding customers, who\nwere just trying to find a good book and you were clearly in the way -insert\neye roll.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The\ntwo of you peeked around the bookcase to see what the guys were doing. They\nwere spread out in the plush chairs, looking completely at home. You couldn\u2019t\nhear what they were talking about, but Jimin was doubled over laughing, while\nJin was shaking his head angrily at Jungkook, who was just shrugging. Taehyung\nlooked like he wanted nothing to do with the mess unfolding before him. You\nlooked back to Remi to find her starting to sink inside the sweater she was\nwearing.<br/>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m turtling. I\u2019m going to turtle!\u201d\nRemi squeaked and hid half her face.<br/>\u201cThey\u2019re really nice, I swear! Also, this is only four\nout of seven\u2026\u201d<br/>\u201cSEVEN?! ARE THE OTHERS COMING HERE TOO?\u201d<br/>\u201cNo, no don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Your mind instantly went to the missing three,\nand you scrunched your face as you thought of Namjoon. Would he even be able to\nrelax like the rest of them? You couldn\u2019t imagine him being able to joke around\nand be goofy when he looked so damn stuffy and high maintenance. Remi stared at\nyou quizzically, watching you get lost in your thoughts. You shook your head.\n\u201cThe others are busy. And who knows, this might be the only time we see these\nguys. Once they realize how much of a loser I am, they\u2019ll lose interest.\u201d Remi\nsmacked your arm.\u00a0<br/>\u201cYou are <i>not </i>a loser. And I can\u2019t\nbelieve I\u2019m saying this but get over there. I\u2019m going to spend another minute\ntaking some deep breaths and finding my zen before I come out to grab your\norders.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remi\nshoved you away, and you stumbled, knocking one of the tables and smacking your\nshin. You sighed in pain, why were you always so clumsy?<br/>\u201cY/N! Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?\u201d Jimin called\nfrom his chair, looking deeply concerned. You knew if you said yes, he would\nmost likely bolt right over and start cooing over you, so you shook your head\nno and walked over to the group. You noticed right away that there wasn\u2019t a\nchair for you. The disappointment must\u2019ve showed on your face, because Jimin\nleaned towards you, his expression changing to a sly grin. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any\nchairs left to fit all of us, so you can just sit on my lap.\u201d Before you even\nhad time to protest, Jimin had pulled you down and you fell on top of him. His\nhands went to the spot where you had hit the table and he gently caressed your\nleg. \u201cOh, baby girl, you <i>did</i> hurt\nyourself.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every\npart of you that touched Jimin lit on fire. Feelings that you couldn\u2019t quite\nput a name to were overwhelming you and all you wanted to do was scream and run\nand hide in a corner until you could get a hold of yourself. Jin, Jungkook and\nTaehyung all stared in your direction, making you even more uncomfortable than\nyou already were. The only solution you could come up with was to hide your\nface in your hands.<br/>\u201cY/N? You can sit between Jin and I, there\u2019s enough room.\nYou don\u2019t have to give in to this thirsty boy\u2019s shenanigans.\u201d Jungkook\nsuggested, and you flipped yourself off of Jimin and dove into the small spot\nbetween the two larger guys.<br/>\u201cKookie, that wasn\u2019t nice, and I am not thirsty! You are\ngiving Y/N the wrong ideas about me!\u201d Jimin started complaining, his full lips\nturning into a frown. He sunk back into his chair with displeasure.<br/>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> giving her\nthe wrong ideas? I have never laid eyes on such filth.\u201d<br/>\u201cYikes.\u201d You blurted out, your hands still covering your\nface. Jin gently punched you on the arm amused. You peeked from your hands and\ngave Jin a small smile. You could still hear Jimin grumbling and huffing across\nfrom you, his knees pulled to his chest.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey,\nuh, excuse me.\u201d Remi was standing beside the five of you, her notebook out. She\nlooked at you, and only you. \u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d<br/>\nWanting to move the attention to someone else, you decided to tell the guys\nthat she was your best friend that you had mentioned earlier. The guys\nimmediately lit up with excitement, throwing compliments at her along with\ntheir coffee orders. You watched her carefully, noticing her voice become\nquieter and she started sinking into her sweater again. You leaned over Jin and\ngrabbed her hand. </p><p>\u201cIgnore these fools,\u201d you whispered, trying to send her\npositive vibes and encouragement.<br/>\u201cRemi!\u201d Taehyung shouted, \u201cYou should hang out with us\nsometime! We would love to see you and Y/N together as a duo. I feel like you\nwould fit in perfectly with us. If you weren\u2019t working, I would say join us\nnow, but, y\u2019know.\u201d<br/>\u201cUh, yeah, maybe next time. I\u2019m going to put your orders\nin and then I\u2019ve got some stuff to do in the back. It was really nice to meet\nyou, you\u2019re all so\u2026 <i>enjoyable.</i> Y/N,\ngirl, text me later.\u201d Remi shuffled away, and you knew she was at her limit of\nhandling the situation. \u00a0You looked back\nto the guys, wondering how you got yourself into this mess.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A\ndifferent server brought your drinks to the table, and you knew you wouldn\u2019t\nsee Remi again for the rest of your time here. You grabbed your mug, taking a\nlong sip. Caffeine would help. It always helped and right now it felt like a\nlifeline that you were desperately clinging to. Besides, you still had another\nclass to get through before you could finally call it a day and go home. The\nfive of you were getting along so well. Jin making awful puns, causing you to\npunch him numerous times in disgust, Jungkook calling out Jimin every time he\ntried to make even a slight move on you, Jimin pouting for 75% of the time,\nTaehyung giving everyone fashion advice and showing off his photo shoot pictures.\nIt was a beautiful sight to behold. The more you talked, the more you felt a\nbond forming between you guys. You thought about the ones that weren\u2019t there,\nand a small pang rang through you. You wanted to get to know them as well, and\nmaybe you would eventually. The guys all seemed extremely close, so there was a\ndefinite chance you would be hanging out with all of them some time.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nlooked at your phone for the first time in a while, only to be met with the\ntime staring you in the face once again.<br/>\n\u201cFOR REAL?!\u201d <br/>\nYou started grabbing for your bag, trying to get yourself together. The guys\nlooked at each other in confusion, before realization crossed their faces.<br/>\u201cSHIT. YOU HAVE CLASS. WE HAVE CLASS.\u201d Jin screamed,\nflying out of his seat. The others followed suit and soon enough you were all\nscreaming goodbye to Remi, who was still in the back, and flying out of the\ncoffee shop. The five of you ran all the way back to the school, screaming\ngoodbyes and continuing on. A part of you felt a sense of relief, finally being\non your own again, and the other part of you was upset you didn\u2019t even get any\nof their numbers. Your phone pinged, and you had a twitter notification.\nSomehow, they had found your twitter. Already.\u00a0<br/><i>Jimin probably found it first.<br/></i>You were too busy looking at your phone, that you hadn\u2019t\nnoticed yourself approaching a tall figure, rather quickly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your\nentire body collided with the person and soon enough, you found yourself on top\nof said human. A whimper escaped your mouth as the other person wheezed.<br/>\u201cOh my God, I am so sorry. I wasn\u2019t paying attention,\nthis is all my fault-\u201d<br/>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right this is your fault. Why weren\u2019t you watching where you\nwere-\u201d<br/>The two of you stopped as soon as you realized who the\nother was. You quickly got up and brushed yourself off, your face brightening.\u00a0<br/><i>Why him? Why him? Why me? Why now?</i></p><p>It looked like Namjoon was thinking the exact same thing\nas you. His face soured and he crossed his arms, and you couldn\u2019t help but\nnotice a faint blush staining his cheeks. <br/><i>He\u2019s embarrassed. </i><br/>\nYour blood started to heat at the sight of something so adorable, and you tried\nto push it down, but it wasn\u2019t happening.<br/>\u201cS-sorry.\u201d You stuttered, looking at your feet.\u00a0<br/>How could this happen twice now? Was this fate? Was destiny trying to make you\nmortal enemies?<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He replied curtly.<br/>\u201cA-alright, I\u2019ll, uh, continue to class then. S-sorry\nagain. I didn\u2019t mean to ruin your day twice\u2026\u201d<br/>You grabbed the edges of your shorts, put your head down\nand tried your hardest to just walk past him, but he grabbed your arm to stop\nyou.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your\neyes widened and you looked up at him. His sunglasses were on his head now and\nyou could really see what he looked like. You felt a blush rising in you, but\nyou couldn\u2019t move. The wind played through his hair, and your heart skipped. His\nlips were slightly parted, as if he was trying to figure out what to say to\nyou. You saw the darkness under his eyes, he looked barely functional. That was\nprobably why he had been wearing sunglasses. You instantly felt all the\nannoyance and anger leave your body, and every inch of you wanted to wrap him\nin your arms and tell him it would be okay. You could feel the weight he was\ncarrying just by looking at him. As if he felt you reading him, he let go of\nyour arm and put his sunglasses back on. He took a couple steps before turning\nhis head to the side. <br/>\n\u201cYou\u2026 you didn\u2019t ruin my day.\u201d <br/>\nIt was as if his voice carried on the wind. It was barely audible, but you\nheard it. Your feet were still frozen in place, and you watched him walk away.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\ninstantly thought of the things the guys had mentioned earlier. How whatever\nNamjoon and the other two were working on was some sort of secret. You had no\nidea what it could possibly be, but it was clearly taking a toll on him, and as\nyou walked the rest of the way to class you found yourself thinking of ways to\ncheer him up.\n\n\n\n</p>",

I COULDN\u2019T JUST SAY NO.\u201d The intense whispers\nbetween you and Remi were starting to concern the surrounding customers, who\nwere just trying to find a good book and you were clearly in the way -insert\neye roll.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The\ntwo of you peeked around the bookcase to see what the guys were doing. They\nwere spread out in the plush chairs, looking completely at home. You couldn\u2019t\nhear what they were talking about, but Jimin was doubled over laughing, while\nJin was shaking his head angrily at Jungkook, who was just shrugging. Taehyung\nlooked like he wanted nothing to do with the mess unfolding before him. You\nlooked back to Remi to find her starting to sink inside the sweater she was\nwearing.<br>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m turtling. I\u2019m going to turtle!\u201d\nRemi squeaked and hid half her face.<br>\u201cThey\u2019re really nice, I swear! Also, this is only four\nout of seven\u2026\u201d<br>\u201cSEVEN?! ARE THE OTHERS COMING HERE TOO?\u201d<br>\u201cNo, no don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Your mind instantly went to the missing three,\nand you scrunched your face as you thought of Namjoon. Would he even be able to\nrelax like the rest of them? You couldn\u2019t imagine him being able to joke around\nand be goofy when he looked so damn stuffy and high maintenance. Remi stared at\nyou quizzically, watching you get lost in your thoughts. You shook your head.\n\u201cThe others are busy. And who knows, this might be the only time we see these\nguys. Once they realize how much of a loser I am, they\u2019ll lose interest.\u201d Remi\nsmacked your arm.\u00a0<br>\u201cYou are <i>not </i>a loser. And I can\u2019t\nbelieve I\u2019m saying this but get over there. I\u2019m going to spend another minute\ntaking some deep breaths and finding my zen before I come out to grab your\norders.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remi\nshoved you away, and you stumbled, knocking one of the tables and smacking your\nshin. You sighed in pain, why were you always so clumsy?<br>\u201cY/N! Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?\u201d Jimin called\nfrom his chair, looking deeply concerned. You knew if you said yes, he would\nmost likely bolt right over and start cooing over you, so you shook your head\nno and walked over to the group. You noticed right away that there wasn\u2019t a\nchair for you. The disappointment must\u2019ve showed on your face, because Jimin\nleaned towards you, his expression changing to a sly grin. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any\nchairs left to fit all of us, so you can just sit on my lap.\u201d Before you even\nhad time to protest, Jimin had pulled you down and you fell on top of him. His\nhands went to the spot where you had hit the table and he gently caressed your\nleg. \u201cOh, baby girl, you <i>did</i> hurt\nyourself.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every\npart of you that touched Jimin lit on fire. Feelings that you couldn\u2019t quite\nput a name to were overwhelming you and all you wanted to do was scream and run\nand hide in a corner until you could get a hold of yourself. Jin, Jungkook and\nTaehyung all stared in your direction, making you even more uncomfortable than\nyou already were. The only solution you could come up with was to hide your\nface in your hands.<br>\u201cY/N? You can sit between Jin and I, there\u2019s enough room.\nYou don\u2019t have to give in to this thirsty boy\u2019s shenanigans.\u201d Jungkook\nsuggested, and you flipped yourself off of Jimin and dove into the small spot\nbetween the two larger guys.<br>\u201cKookie, that wasn\u2019t nice, and I am not thirsty! You are\ngiving Y/N the wrong ideas about me!\u201d Jimin started complaining, his full lips\nturning into a frown. He sunk back into his chair with displeasure.<br>\u201c<i>I\u2019m</i> giving her\nthe wrong ideas? I have never laid eyes on such filth.\u201d<br>\u201cYikes.\u201d You blurted out, your hands still covering your\nface. Jin gently punched you on the arm amused. You peeked from your hands and\ngave Jin a small smile. You could still hear Jimin grumbling and huffing across\nfrom you, his knees pulled to his chest.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey,\nuh, excuse me.\u201d Remi was standing beside the five of you, her notebook out. She\nlooked at you, and only you. \u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d<br>\nWanting to move the attention to someone else, you decided to tell the guys\nthat she was your best friend that you had mentioned earlier. The guys\nimmediately lit up with excitement, throwing compliments at her along with\ntheir coffee orders. You watched her carefully, noticing her voice become\nquieter and she started sinking into her sweater again. You leaned over Jin and\ngrabbed her hand. </p><p>\u201cIgnore these fools,\u201d you whispered, trying to send her\npositive vibes and encouragement.<br>\u201cRemi!\u201d Taehyung shouted, \u201cYou should hang out with us\nsometime! We would love to see you and Y/N together as a duo. I feel like you\nwould fit in perfectly with us. If you weren\u2019t working, I would say join us\nnow, but, y\u2019know.\u201d<br>\u201cUh, yeah, maybe next time. I\u2019m going to put your orders\nin and then I\u2019ve got some stuff to do in the back. It was really nice to meet\nyou, you\u2019re all so\u2026 <i>enjoyable.</i> Y/N,\ngirl, text me later.\u201d Remi shuffled away, and you knew she was at her limit of\nhandling the situation. \u00a0You looked back\nto the guys, wondering how you got yourself into this mess.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A\ndifferent server brought your drinks to the table, and you knew you wouldn\u2019t\nsee Remi again for the rest of your time here. You grabbed your mug, taking a\nlong sip. Caffeine would help. It always helped and right now it felt like a\nlifeline that you were desperately clinging to. Besides, you still had another\nclass to get through before you could finally call it a day and go home. The\nfive of you were getting along so well. Jin making awful puns, causing you to\npunch him numerous times in disgust, Jungkook calling out Jimin every time he\ntried to make even a slight move on you, Jimin pouting for 75% of the time,\nTaehyung giving everyone fashion advice and showing off his photo shoot pictures.\nIt was a beautiful sight to behold. The more you talked, the more you felt a\nbond forming between you guys. You thought about the ones that weren\u2019t there,\nand a small pang rang through you. You wanted to get to know them as well, and\nmaybe you would eventually. The guys all seemed extremely close, so there was a\ndefinite chance you would be hanging out with all of them some time.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nlooked at your phone for the first time in a while, only to be met with the\ntime staring you in the face once again.<br>\n\u201cFOR REAL?!\u201d <br>\nYou started grabbing for your bag, trying to get yourself together. The guys\nlooked at each other in confusion, before realization crossed their faces.<br>\u201cSHIT. YOU HAVE CLASS. WE HAVE CLASS.\u201d Jin screamed,\nflying out of his seat. The others followed suit and soon enough you were all\nscreaming goodbye to Remi, who was still in the back, and flying out of the\ncoffee shop. The five of you ran all the way back to the school, screaming\ngoodbyes and continuing on. A part of you felt a sense of relief, finally being\non your own again, and the other part of you was upset you didn\u2019t even get any\nof their numbers. Your phone pinged, and you had a twitter notification.\nSomehow, they had found your twitter. Already.\u00a0<br><i>Jimin probably found it first.<br></i>You were too busy looking at your phone, that you hadn\u2019t\nnoticed yourself approaching a tall figure, rather quickly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your\nentire body collided with the person and soon enough, you found yourself on top\nof said human. A whimper escaped your mouth as the other person wheezed.<br>\u201cOh my God, I am so sorry. I wasn\u2019t paying attention,\nthis is all my fault-\u201d<br>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right this is your fault. Why weren\u2019t you watching where you\nwere-\u201d<br>The two of you stopped as soon as you realized who the\nother was. You quickly got up and brushed yourself off, your face brightening.\u00a0<br><i>Why him? Why him? Why me? Why now?</i></p><p>It looked like Namjoon was thinking the exact same thing\nas you. His face soured and he crossed his arms, and you couldn\u2019t help but\nnotice a faint blush staining his cheeks. <br><i>He\u2019s embarrassed. </i><br>\nYour blood started to heat at the sight of something so adorable, and you tried\nto push it down, but it wasn\u2019t happening.<br>\u201cS-sorry.\u201d You stuttered, looking at your feet.\u00a0<br>How could this happen twice now?

It was really nice to meet\nyou, you&rsquo;re all so&hellip; <i>enjoyable.</i> Y/N,\ngirl, text me later.&rdquo; Remi shuffled away, and you knew she was at her limit of\nhandling the situation. &nbsp;You looked back\nto the guys, wondering how you got yourself into this mess.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A\ndifferent server brought your drinks to the table, and you knew you wouldn&rsquo;t\nsee Remi again for the rest of your time here. You grabbed your mug, taking a\nlong sip. Caffeine would help. It always helped and right now it felt like a\nlifeline that you were desperately clinging to. Besides, you still had another\nclass to get through before you could finally call it a day and go home. The\nfive of you were getting along so well. Jin making awful puns, causing you to\npunch him numerous times in disgust, Jungkook calling out Jimin every time he\ntried to make even a slight move on you, Jimin pouting for 75% of the time,\nTaehyung giving everyone fashion advice and showing off his photo shoot pictures.\nIt was a beautiful sight to behold. The more you talked, the more you felt a\nbond forming between you guys. You thought about the ones that weren&rsquo;t there,\nand a small pang rang through you. You wanted to get to know them as well, and\nmaybe you would eventually. The guys all seemed extremely close, so there was a\ndefinite chance you would be hanging out with all of them some time.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\nlooked at your phone for the first time in a while, only to be met with the\ntime staring you in the face once again.<br />\n&ldquo;FOR REAL?!&rdquo; <br />\nYou started grabbing for your bag, trying to get yourself together. The guys\nlooked at each other in confusion, before realization crossed their faces.<br />&ldquo;SHIT. YOU HAVE CLASS. WE HAVE CLASS.&rdquo; Jin screamed,\nflying out of his seat. The others followed suit and soon enough you were all\nscreaming goodbye to Remi, who was still in the back, and flying out of the\ncoffee shop. The five of you ran all the way back to the school, screaming\ngoodbyes and continuing on. A part of you felt a sense of relief, finally being\non your own again, and the other part of you was upset you didn&rsquo;t even get any\nof their numbers. Your phone pinged, and you had a twitter notification.\nSomehow, they had found your twitter. Already.&nbsp;<br /><i>Jimin probably found it first.<br /></i>You were too busy looking at your phone, that you hadn&rsquo;t\nnoticed yourself approaching a tall figure, rather quickly.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your\nentire body collided with the person and soon enough, you found yourself on top\nof said human. A whimper escaped your mouth as the other person wheezed.<br />&ldquo;Oh my God, I am so sorry. I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention,\nthis is all my fault-&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re damn right this is your fault. Why weren&rsquo;t you watching where you\nwere-&rdquo;<br />The two of you stopped as soon as you realized who the\nother was. You quickly got up and brushed yourself off, your face brightening.&nbsp;<br /><i>Why him? Why him? Why me? Why now?</i></p><p>It looked like Namjoon was thinking the exact same thing\nas you. His face soured and he crossed his arms, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but\nnotice a faint blush staining his cheeks. <br /><i>He&rsquo;s embarrassed. </i><br />\nYour blood started to heat at the sight of something so adorable, and you tried\nto push it down, but it wasn&rsquo;t happening.<br />&ldquo;S-sorry.&rdquo; You stuttered, looking at your feet.&nbsp;<br />How could this happen twice now? Was this fate? Was destiny trying to make you\nmortal enemies?<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; He replied curtly.<br />&ldquo;A-alright, I&rsquo;ll, uh, continue to class then. S-sorry\nagain. I didn&rsquo;t mean to ruin your day twice&hellip;&rdquo;<br />You grabbed the edges of your shorts, put your head down\nand tried your hardest to just walk past him, but he grabbed your arm to stop\nyou.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your\neyes widened and you looked up at him. His sunglasses were on his head now and\nyou could really see what he looked like. You felt a blush rising in you, but\nyou couldn&rsquo;t move. The wind played through his hair, and your heart skipped. His\nlips were slightly parted, as if he was trying to figure out what to say to\nyou. You saw the darkness under his eyes, he looked barely functional. That was\nprobably why he had been wearing sunglasses. You instantly felt all the\nannoyance and anger leave your body, and every inch of you wanted to wrap him\nin your arms and tell him it would be okay. You could feel the weight he was\ncarrying just by looking at him. As if he felt you reading him, he let go of\nyour arm and put his sunglasses back on. He took a couple steps before turning\nhis head to the side. <br />\n&ldquo;You&hellip; you didn&rsquo;t ruin my day.&rdquo; <br />\nIt was as if his voice carried on the wind. It was barely audible, but you\nheard it. Your feet were still frozen in place, and you watched him walk away.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\ninstantly thought of the things the guys had mentioned earlier. How whatever\nNamjoon and the other two were working on was some sort of secret. You had no\nidea what it could possibly be, but it was clearly taking a toll on him, and as\nyou walked the rest of the way to class you found yourself thinking of ways to\ncheer him up.\n\n\n\n</p>",
