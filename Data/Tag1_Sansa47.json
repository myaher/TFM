No stupid love stories here.</p><p>3) I would have the Dorne storyline,  like, abolished. Ellaria would have kept herself, and her children out if the conflict, just as she did in the book. Also, anyone else find it strange that the other, younger, childre are mentioned once and then never mentioned or seen? </p><p>4)   Daenerys would not fall in love with Jon, or so quickly? Like, she&rsquo;d have her priorities straight, her throne. I love her, I can&rsquo;t see her falling for Jon so quickly in a real life situation. She has more important things to think about. </p><p>5) Elia Martell would be mentioned more, her children ect, like, Jon would think about them, once the truth came out and he would be angry too. </p><p>6) Sansa would be Wardness in the North, while Jon is a male, he would still be a bastard, thus having no claim to Wintefell.  </p><p>7) MISSANDEI OF NAATH WOULD LIVE.</p><p>8)  Arya would still kill the Night King, and I would have had some dialogue between him and Bran, even like, whispered in the background. </p><p>9) Yara would have been angrier at Dany, for essentially, abandoning her to Cersei, but she&rsquo;d still support her and keep the Iron Islands available for a retreat. </p><p>10) I&rsquo;d have killed Bran.

Many have called her\nstubborn and cold and it is hard to call those people liars, though it is said\nshe laughed once at the Wilding Prince\u2019s joke. Dedicated to her people and her\nkingdom, Sarina has driven herself to be a Queen worthy of the Old Kings of\nWinterfell. She is a severe beauty with thick auburn hair and violet eyes. The severity\nof her looks is only matched by that of her personality. Sarina is decent with\na needle, strong with a sword, and elegant on horse.</p><p><b>Name Reasoning:</b>\nVariant of Serena \u2013 meaning calm, serene and tranquil, often invoking the idea\nof peace. Appropriate for their first-born child and future heir to the North,\nwhere hopefully her rule will take after her name. In addition, there have been\nSerena Starks in the past. </p><p><b>Look Reasoning:</b>\nThose Tully genes are damn strong, but it would be interesting if some\nTargaryen showed itself in a child or two. </p><p><b>Additional Reasoning:</b>\nPersonally, I would love if they had a first-born daughter who was then made to\nbe their heir. Like the whole male comes first, seems very stupid and petty\nespecially after facing the White Walkers and everything else.\u00a0</p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"673\" data-orig-height=\"564\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0a98cc777248601e8e072bcd0e37b33/tumblr_inline_prewc3rMNF1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"673\" data-orig-height=\"564\"/></figure><p><b>Princess Aileana Stark of\nWinterfell </b> <br/>\nThe Dancing Wolf <br/>\nSecond Child </p><p>Aileana Stark as a child was lovely and kind with an\ninterest for only the finer things in life and making others happy. As she grew\nolder not much changed. She harbors a great love for music and an even greater one\nfor dancing as well as swimming and even sailing. Quick to smile, Aileana is\nthe warmth to her older sister\u2019s coldness. Though it is said her own sweet\nvoice hides a clever and sharp tongue, often overlooked by others. With her pale\nblonde hair and even paler grey eyes, there\u2019s no denying her father\u2019s Targaryen\nheritage. Aileana has an insatiable desire to see and live outside the walls of\nWinterfell to explore the seas of the world and the lands of Essos and beyond. </p><p><b>Name Reasoning:</b> Aileana\n\u2013 meaning green or from the green meadow. I thought it would be nice if one of\nthe children\u2019s names meant green, as it\u2019s a time for spring. In addition, the\none with the most Targaryen looks, I thought green was appropriate for another\nreason.</p><p><b>Look Reasoning:</b> Interesting\nif some of that Targaryen came through, but with the traditional grey eyes of\nthe Starks. \u00a0</p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"676\" data-orig-height=\"528\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b6b469a5db520478bf73669a9db10ea/tumblr_inline_prewd8qRko1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"676\" data-orig-height=\"528\"/></figure><p><b>Princess Raisel Stark\nof Winterfell</b> \u00a0<br/>\nThe Quiet Wolf <br/>\nThird Child<b> </b></p><p>Raisel Stark is a sweet, caring and shy young lady who has a\nnervous giggle she cannot seem to get rid of. Her love of sweets, particulary\nthose of a lemon variety, is known across the land as well as her fondness for\nflowers. She can often be found in Winterfell\u2019s library or the Glass Gardens. Not\na severe beauty like her older sisters nor a wild wolf like her younger, it is\neasy for those grey eyes and dark hair of hers to get lost in a household of\nfive.

In addition, the\none with the most Targaryen looks, I thought green was appropriate for another\nreason.</p><p><b>Look Reasoning:</b> Interesting\nif some of that Targaryen came through, but with the traditional grey eyes of\nthe Starks. &nbsp;</p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b6b469a5db520478bf73669a9db10ea/tumblr_inline_prewd8qRko1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Princess Raisel Stark\nof Winterfell</b> &nbsp;<br />\nThe Quiet Wolf <br />\nThird Child<b> </b></p><p>Raisel Stark is a sweet, caring and shy young lady who has a\nnervous giggle she cannot seem to get rid of. Her love of sweets, particulary\nthose of a lemon variety, is known across the land as well as her fondness for\nflowers. She can often be found in Winterfell&rsquo;s library or the Glass Gardens. Not\na severe beauty like her older sisters nor a wild wolf like her younger, it is\neasy for those grey eyes and dark hair of hers to get lost in a household of\nfive. But she shines when there are hunting parties, with her bow and arrow and\nher eyes able to spot the prey before anyone else &ndash; she truly is a lovely sight\nto behold. </p><p><b>Name Reasoning:</b>\nRaisel means Rose, which is fitting for Jon and Sansa who both are connected to\nroses and have a fondness for them. To my knowledge there are no Raisels within\nASOIAF, but Rose or Roslyn just seem a bit plain to me. And I can easily see\nsomeone being named Raisel in Westeros. </p><p><b>Look Reasoning:</b>&nbsp;Seeing as both Jon and Sansa are half Stark\nthemselves, one of their children would have to have the entire Stark look.&nbsp;</p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4916da8191b68737226fcddc94401ae7/tumblr_inline_preweldLTb1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Prince Edwyn Stark of\nWinterfell </b><br />\nThe Laughing Wolf <br />\nFourth Child &nbsp;</p><p>Edwyn Stark is the twin-brother of Lyarra Stark. He is a clever\nand creative young man who has a fondness for stories and songs, particulary\nthe ones his mother told him when he was younger. Charming and friendly, there\nis not a friend Edwyn can&rsquo;t make nor a secret he doesn&rsquo;t know nor willing to\nshare. With an affinity for tall-tales and talent for going off on dangerous\nquests with his twin, he has gotten himself in enough trouble to last him\nseveral lifetimes. Though with those big Tully-blue eyes and soft dark-auburn\nhair, his troubles never seem to last him for that long. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Name Reasoning:</b> Variant\nof Edwin &ndash; meaning Wealthy Friend. Close enough to Eddard Stark to show Jon\n&amp; Sansa are thinking of their &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; but also different enough that it\nallows their child to have their own future. There was a King Edwyn Stark who\nwas known as the Spring King. So, they probably thought their first born was\ngoing to be a boy so they had the name already picked out. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Look Reasoning:</b> Tully\nGenes are strong. </p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29a7b50943afe7b689ba2c680a201b36/tumblr_inline_prewgjsEE01qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Princess Lyarra Stark\n</b><br />\nThe Wild Wolf <br />The Fifth Child</p><p>Lyarra Stark is the twin-sister of Edwyn and the youngest\nand wildest Stark sibling. There is no beast that Lyarra does not love nor want\nto keep. She will jump into mud puddles and bring frogs and snakes into her bed\nand even climb the tallest of trees to see if she can get the birds to teach\nher the old tongue. She often explores the crypts with her twin to see if they can find\nany dragon eggs left behind. She has little patience for sewing or embroidery and even\nless for the likes of combat and hunting. If one to see her, they would assume\nthat dark, curly auburn hair of hers has never seen a brush and her big Tully eyes\nare rarely not filled with laughter and mischief. </p><p><b>Name Reasoning:</b>&nbsp;Unknown Meaning. Possibly a variant on Lyra meaning &ldquo;lyre.&rdquo; Arguably,\nLyanna is the safest parent name for Jon and Sansa in my opinion, but I thought\nit be nice if they honored their grandmother, Lyarra Stark as well as have a\nname close to Lyanna, but allowing their child a different fate. </p><p><b>Look Reasoning:</b> Tully genes are unstoppable.&nbsp;</p></p>",

And as her season blankets them all, it is difficult to preen at the ghost filled halls that had created the monsters that once held her captive. Once again she feels a stranger. Though she is here, and he knows her, she is all Winter Queen.</p><p>Only when her gaze finds Tyrion in the crowd, a tiny lord, unimpressive amongst his knights and guards, does her gaze soften, the deep blue of the sea washing back in. And for a moment, Tyrion feels like he is drowning.</p><p>Servants introduce them, introduces her entourage and her knights, before doing the same for House Lannister, and though formality demands he pays attention, for once it is difficult to care for those he might have to play games with soon. For his queen. For the good of the realm.</p><p>A useless game, he thinks as the Queen in the North dismounts on her own. Tall, her every limb singing a song of elegance and harmony so beautiful he hears one of the lesser noble girls sigh in admiration. Winter flowers are braided into the decorations of her hair, a crown of flowers, the only sign of innocent romanticism still marking her character.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Lannister,&rdquo; she greets him as she pauses, lowering herself with no more than a nod.</p><p>The grey cloaks, that keep her warm on the long ride, flow forwards like the tide, hiding him from his House for a single moment. A protective shadow that affords him a single chance of meeting her gaze, unhindered by politics. Her eyes are dancing.</p><p>And Tyrion nearly laughs.</p><p>My lord is the standard response.</p><p>A futile game, indeed.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>Whispers break out in the crowds behind him, shock a tiny ripple for now. Giving ground so easily and so quickly suggests more than courtesy and formality, but the nature of these negotiations. The result that Tyrion is willing to accept. Even if it means he will lose her forever in the process.</p><p>&ldquo;Eventually the Starks are always right, Maester Aemon once told me,&rdquo; Tyrion says, in an attempt to disguise their voices. And he means to say other things, say so much more. But this is all he can find the words for now. &ldquo;Winter is coming.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiles at the humour in his greeting. &ldquo;The winter came a long time ago.&rdquo;</p></p>",
