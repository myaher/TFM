The Hydra agents used to place a tv by my cage and we&rsquo;d watch crime shows whenever they weren&rsquo;t invading a government building. A real bonding moment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, smartass. I had to ask.&rdquo; You could see the corners of Ross&rsquo; mouth pull up in a smile he was trying to suppress. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go over the basics of what you will be expecting while Agent Romanov takes care of other areas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, kiddo.&rdquo; As if she had just appeared out of thin air, the one you had heard of referred to as Black Widow was suddenly at Agent Ross&rsquo; side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to make you look presentable for court. Not that you can&rsquo;t rock the whole bed sheet look, but that&rsquo;s tend to be frowned upon by a judge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank the gods. I was getting pretty tired of washing the same bed sheet halves over and over again. The skirt isn&rsquo;t as easy to wrap around as the top is and I was wondering how long it would take for you guys to finally give me clothes that would actually fit my body.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long did it take Hydra?&rdquo; Widow was carrying a large duffle bag with her and Agent Ross walked over to the control panel for your cell.</p><p>&ldquo;Five years, and even then they made me do it myself with scraps of fabric. But still, better than bed sheets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And no doubt warmer. By the way, you can call me Nat if you want.&rdquo; Ross pressed a button and to your surprise, your cell door opened and Nat walked right in. The door slammed shut behind her and she noticed your shocked look. &ldquo;I was trained by the KGB. Everyone&rsquo;s confident I would escape with my life if you tried to attack me.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave a smirk and shook your head. &ldquo;In response to making my own clothes, I never get cold so the bed sheets were never an issue in regards to that. And as for attacking you, not if I wrapped my tail around your neck. I never would, but I felt I should be honest with all I can do, collar or not.&rdquo;</p><p>Nat returned the smirk as she set the bag on your bed. &ldquo;I appreciate the honesty. Means you are starting to trust us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to and I really want to, but it&rsquo;s so hard to unprogram over a decade of being betrayed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that whole song and dance. I was supposed to be killed by SHIELD as well years ago. But here I am and if all goes well, the same can happen for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; You walked over to where Nat stood, pulling fabric and various tools to make an outfit for you. Clearing your throat, you looked down at the bed as you spoke next. &ldquo;How is Thor? Have I gotten him in trouble?&rdquo;</p><p>Nat&rsquo;s smirk turned into a warm smile and she did something you never expected the expert assassin to do: she pulled you into a hug. You were frozen for a moment, haven&rsquo;t not been hug in so many years, but you finally melted into the embrace and hugged her back. &ldquo;Gotta admit, never had to hug someone with wings before. It&rsquo;s a little awkward.&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help your laugh as you two pulled apart. Nat reached over and wiped a tear off your cheek you didn&rsquo;t know had fallen. &ldquo;Try being on my end. Sometimes it&rsquo;s impossible to find a comfortable position to sit or even sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even imagine. And I see what you mean by never getting cold. You clearly run a higher body temp than most people. You feel like you&rsquo;re about to burst into flames.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirked at that. &ldquo;Fire cannot kill a dragon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok settle down, Daenerys,&rdquo; she turned back to the bag and pulled out a cloth measuring tape. As she began to measure your body - specifically where your wings and tail landed on you - Nat continued to talk. &ldquo;As for Thor, he&rsquo;s fine. Secretary Ross couldn&rsquo;t touch him even if he wanted to. I mean, seriously, how do you put sanctions on a god? Stark and Rhodey are currently explaining to him how the court systems work for a situation as complicated as this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how will the system work?&rdquo;</p><p>Nat stopped and looked at you. &ldquo;Honestly? We&rsquo;re not sure. I was brought into SHIELD secretly so no one would know of my background of being a sparrow. Bucky kinda freed himself from Hydra but needed Steve&rsquo;s help to fully break free, which required a trip to Wakanda for a crash course in deprogramming. You&rsquo;re not like either of us. I fought with the KGB on purpose and Bucky was brainwashed by Hydra. You&hellip;.&rdquo; she sighed and squeezed your arm, &ldquo;you were kidnapped, beaten, tortured, abused, and threatened with death. Not to mention you&rsquo;re also classified as a very dangerous alpha level mutant. The public&rsquo;s still on the fence on how they feel about mutants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alpha level?&rdquo; Your eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>&ldquo;It means you have a very high mutant power level. Some alphas are almost omega level with their powers but omega level mutants - on top of their power level - can also blend in seamlessly with their surroundings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah,&rdquo; you glanced back at your wings. &ldquo;Clearly that isn&rsquo;t me. So I&rsquo;ll have an uphill battle, is what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but you won&rsquo;t be alone. On top of anyone we can get from the Avengers and SHIELD, Professor Xavier is coming by to do an analysis of your personality and mental state to present it before the court. He&rsquo;s better versed than the rest of us on the mentality of mutants, especially if they were used and/or created to be weapons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You make it seem like that&rsquo;s a common thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than you would think. Logan, one of the mutants sent to capture you months ago, he was captured and used in the Weapon X Program decades ago. He&rsquo;s an alpha level mutant as well and then he had his entire skeleton covered in adamantium. Xavier&rsquo;s helped turn his life around and he&rsquo;s confident he can do the same for you.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled this around in your head as Nat took measurements, held up different cloth options against your skin, and finally typing into a very high tech looking phone. </p><p>&ldquo;Welp, I&rsquo;ve done all I need and sent the info over to Shell Head. He&rsquo;ll get started on getting a couple different outfits ready for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, a couple? Won&rsquo;t I only need one for court?&rdquo;</p><p>Nat smiled, &ldquo;normally, yes. But Stark is nothing if not a prepper. He&rsquo;ll have a uniform ready along with some day-to-day clothes for you as he&rsquo;s so damn sure you&rsquo;ll become an Avenger now that Thor&rsquo;s taking a liking to you.&rdquo;</p><p>You blushed at this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised your team is so open to welcoming me in when just a few months ago I was made to attack you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the operative word: made. Not to mention, but we couldn&rsquo;t help notice that you never really shot your fire at anyone. Yeah, empty vehicles and Hydra agents were torched, but not us. Even when you did fire in our direction, you missed us when the shots were rather easy.&rdquo; Nat gave you a knowing look.</p><p>Nodding your head, you licked your lips before answering. &ldquo;I always hated that I had to work for Hydra and I did everything in my power to keep from having to torch people directly if I could get away with it. There were so many of you on the battlefield and so many vehicles, I felt I could make it look like I was attacking you without actually doing so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Smart move. Great way to let your &lsquo;enemies&rsquo; know you&rsquo;re not really there to harm them.&rdquo;</p><p>Before you could discuss the trial further, the doors down the hall burst open and you could hear approaching footsteps along with what sounded like wheels rolling closer. You and Nat went to the glass wall to see who was breaking the visitor rule.</p><p>&ldquo;So this is how you get a Black Widow into a glass jar,&rdquo; Bucky joked as he strolled up.</p><p>Nat just stuck her tongue out. Professor Xavier rolled up behind him with Steve right next to him. &ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss ______. Are you ready for your evaluation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As ready as I possibly could be, considering I have no idea what&rsquo;s even going to happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing a big change has occurred,&rdquo; Steve jumped in.</p><p>Agent Ross looked up from his paperwork. &ldquo;What big change?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For one, the venue&rsquo;s been changed. If I may?&rdquo; Xavier gestured to the cell and Agent Ross opened the door. You watched as Nat and Xavier changed places. &ldquo;For another, so has who will be presiding the entire event.&rdquo;</p><p>Agent Ross looked back at his notes. &ldquo;Changes? I still have here that it&rsquo;s to be held at Military Tribunal as _____ is technically a war criminal.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve spoke up, &ldquo;well the thing is, with ____ being a former Hydra captive and held in different locations all over the world, the trial was going to be moved to the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky interrupted, &ldquo;but since Stark and Thor are dead set on making _____ an Avenger, it&rsquo;s more complicated now. Especially with _____ being a mutant and a victim of Hydra. Much of the mutant community is calling out both Hydra and SHIELD for practicing cruel and unusual methods in regards to how she is/was kept on the sites respectively. So now-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s being held by the U.N.&rdquo; Xavier finished as he rolled farther into your cell.</p><p>\u201cWhat will that mean for me?\u201d You questioned as you took a seat on your bed.</p><p>\u201cIt means you have a more of a fair chance to be freed.\u201d Xavier smiled at you. \u201cWe just need them to see what we see. Shall we begin?\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head and Xavier began his questioning with the others looking on.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/183216281158/a-dragon-is-not-a-slave\">Chapter 9</a></p>",

The Hydra agents used to place a tv by my cage and we\u2019d watch crime shows whenever they weren\u2019t invading a government building. A real bonding moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, smartass. I had to ask.\u201d You could see the corners of Ross\u2019 mouth pull up in a smile he was trying to suppress. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go over the basics of what you will be expecting while Agent Romanov takes care of other areas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d As if she had just appeared out of thin air, the one you had heard of referred to as Black Widow was suddenly at Agent Ross\u2019 side. \u201cI\u2019m here to make you look presentable for court. Not that you can\u2019t rock the whole bed sheet look, but that\u2019s tend to be frowned upon by a judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank the gods. I was getting pretty tired of washing the same bed sheet halves over and over again. The skirt isn\u2019t as easy to wrap around as the top is and I was wondering how long it would take for you guys to finally give me clothes that would actually fit my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take Hydra?\u201d Widow was carrying a large duffle bag with her and Agent Ross walked over to the control panel for your cell.</p><p>\u201cFive years, and even then they made me do it myself with scraps of fabric. But still, better than bed sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no doubt warmer. By the way, you can call me Nat if you want.\u201d Ross pressed a button and to your surprise, your cell door opened and Nat walked right in. The door slammed shut behind her and she noticed your shocked look. \u201cI was trained by the KGB. Everyone\u2019s confident I would escape with my life if you tried to attack me.\u201d</p><p>You gave a smirk and shook your head. \u201cIn response to making my own clothes, I never get cold so the bed sheets were never an issue in regards to that. And as for attacking you, not if I wrapped my tail around your neck. I never would, but I felt I should be honest with all I can do, collar or not.\u201d</p><p>Nat returned the smirk as she set the bag on your bed. \u201cI appreciate the honesty. Means you are starting to trust us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to and I really want to, but it\u2019s so hard to unprogram over a decade of being betrayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that whole song and dance. I was supposed to be killed by SHIELD as well years ago. But here I am and if all goes well, the same can happen for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d You walked over to where Nat stood, pulling fabric and various tools to make an outfit for you. Clearing your throat, you looked down at the bed as you spoke next. \u201cHow is Thor? Have I gotten him in trouble?\u201d</p><p>Nat\u2019s smirk turned into a warm smile and she did something you never expected the expert assassin to do: she pulled you into a hug. You were frozen for a moment, haven\u2019t not been hug in so many years, but you finally melted into the embrace and hugged her back. \u201cGotta admit, never had to hug someone with wings before. It\u2019s a little awkward.\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help your laugh as you two pulled apart. Nat reached over and wiped a tear off your cheek you didn\u2019t know had fallen. \u201cTry being on my end. Sometimes it\u2019s impossible to find a comfortable position to sit or even sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine. And I see what you mean by never getting cold. You clearly run a higher body temp than most people. You feel like you\u2019re about to burst into flames.\u201d</p><p>You smirked at that. \u201cFire cannot kill a dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk settle down, Daenerys,\u201d she turned back to the bag and pulled out a cloth measuring tape. As she began to measure your body - specifically where your wings and tail landed on you - Nat continued to talk. \u201cAs for Thor, he\u2019s fine. Secretary Ross couldn\u2019t touch him even if he wanted to. I mean, seriously, how do you put sanctions on a god? Stark and Rhodey are currently explaining to him how the court systems work for a situation as complicated as this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how will the system work?\u201d</p><p>Nat stopped and looked at you. \u201cHonestly? We\u2019re not sure. I was brought into SHIELD secretly so no one would know of my background of being a sparrow. Bucky kinda freed himself from Hydra but needed Steve\u2019s help to fully break free, which required a trip to Wakanda for a crash course in deprogramming. You\u2019re not like either of us. I fought with the KGB on purpose and Bucky was brainwashed by Hydra. You\u2026.\u201d she sighed and squeezed your arm, \u201cyou were kidnapped, beaten, tortured, abused, and threatened with death. Not to mention you\u2019re also classified as a very dangerous alpha level mutant. The public\u2019s still on the fence on how they feel about mutants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha level?\u201d Your eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cIt means you have a very high mutant power level. Some alphas are almost omega level with their powers but omega level mutants - on top of their power level - can also blend in seamlessly with their surroundings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah,\u201d you glanced back at your wings. \u201cClearly that isn\u2019t me. So I\u2019ll have an uphill battle, is what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you won\u2019t be alone. On top of anyone we can get from the Avengers and SHIELD, Professor Xavier is coming by to do an analysis of your personality and mental state to present it before the court. He\u2019s better versed than the rest of us on the mentality of mutants, especially if they were used and/or created to be weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it seem like that\u2019s a common thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you would think. Logan, one of the mutants sent to capture you months ago, he was captured and used in the Weapon X Program decades ago. He\u2019s an alpha level mutant as well and then he had his entire skeleton covered in adamantium. Xavier\u2019s helped turn his life around and he\u2019s confident he can do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>You rolled this around in your head as Nat took measurements, held up different cloth options against your skin, and finally typing into a very high tech looking phone. </p><p>\u201cWelp, I\u2019ve done all I need and sent the info over to Shell Head. He\u2019ll get started on getting a couple different outfits ready for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, a couple? Won\u2019t I only need one for court?\u201d</p><p>Nat smiled, \u201cnormally, yes. But Stark is nothing if not a prepper. He\u2019ll have a uniform ready along with some day-to-day clothes for you as he\u2019s so damn sure you\u2019ll become an Avenger now that Thor\u2019s taking a liking to you.\u201d</p><p>You blushed at this. \u201cI\u2019m surprised your team is so open to welcoming me in when just a few months ago I was made to attack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the operative word: made. Not to mention, but we couldn\u2019t help notice that you never really shot your fire at anyone. Yeah, empty vehicles and Hydra agents were torched, but not us. Even when you did fire in our direction, you missed us when the shots were rather easy.\u201d Nat gave you a knowing look.</p><p>Nodding your head, you licked your lips before answering. \u201cI always hated that I had to work for Hydra and I did everything in my power to keep from having to torch people directly if I could get away with it. There were so many of you on the battlefield and so many vehicles, I felt I could make it look like I was attacking you without actually doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart move. Great way to let your \u2018enemies\u2019 know you\u2019re not really there to harm them.\u201d</p><p>Before you could discuss the trial further, the doors down the hall burst open and you could hear approaching footsteps along with what sounded like wheels rolling closer. You and Nat went to the glass wall to see who was breaking the visitor rule.</p><p>\u201cSo this is how you get a Black Widow into a glass jar,\u201d Bucky joked as he strolled up.</p><p>Nat just stuck her tongue out. Professor Xavier rolled up behind him with Steve right next to him. \u201cGood afternoon, Miss ______. Are you ready for your evaluation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as I possibly could be, considering I have no idea what\u2019s even going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing a big change has occurred,\u201d Steve jumped in.</p><p>Agent Ross looked up from his paperwork. \u201cWhat big change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one, the venue\u2019s been changed. If I may?\u201d Xavier gestured to the cell and Agent Ross opened the door. You watched as Nat and Xavier changed places. \u201cFor another, so has who will be presiding the entire event.\u201d</p><p>Agent Ross looked back at his notes. \u201cChanges? I still have here that it\u2019s to be held at Military Tribunal as _____ is technically a war criminal.\u201d</p><p>Steve spoke up, \u201cwell the thing is, with ____ being a former Hydra captive and held in different locations all over the world, the trial was going to be moved to the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands.\u201d</p><p>Bucky interrupted, \u201cbut since Stark and Thor are dead set on making _____ an Avenger, it\u2019s more complicated now. Especially with _____ being a mutant and a victim of Hydra. Much of the mutant community is calling out both Hydra and SHIELD for practicing cruel and unusual methods in regards to how she is/was kept on the sites respectively. So now-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being held by the U.N.\u201d Xavier finished as he rolled farther into your cell.</p><p>\u201cWhat will that mean for me?\u201d You questioned as you took a seat on your bed.</p><p>\u201cIt means you have a more of a fair chance to be freed.\u201d Xavier smiled at you. \u201cWe just need them to see what we see. Shall we begin?\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head and Xavier began his questioning with the others looking on.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/183216281158/a-dragon-is-not-a-slave\">Chapter 9</a></p>",

Sure, \nthere has definitely been direct commentary about notable events, and \nspecific characters have appeared that confirm programs like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Daredevil, and Luke Cage\n are set in the same continuity, but the degree to which they are shown \nto be part of one giant franchise has been limited. That relationship \nbetween big and small screen material will change in a significant way \nvery soon, however, namely with the arrival of the upcoming Disney+ \nstreaming service, and its massive original content plans.</p><p>Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige has spoken in the past\n about the challenges that come with balancing continuity across \nmultiple mediums, namely that the pace of the storytelling in film and \ntelevision is so different that it makes them a conflict to sync. That, \nhowever, will not be an issue with the big plans for Disney\u2019s new \nentertainment hub. I sat down with Feige this past weekend during the \nLos Angeles press day for Captain Marvel, and during the interview he explained why programs like the upcoming Loki\n series will have a much more significant Marvel Cinematic Universe \nfeel. Confirming the opportunities for crossover, the executive/producer\n said,</p><p>\n<b><i>\u201cYes. Directly, yeah. One hundred percent. In large part it&rsquo;s because \nwe&rsquo;ve been working on Disney+ for quite a while now, at the exact same \ntime that we were working on the post-Avengers: Endgame MCU, and therefore for the first time ever developed them together.\u201c</i></b></p><p>Going back to the launch of Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. in 2013, Marvel Studios film and television have existed mostly as two separate entities working on two completely different schedules,\n but the creation of the new streaming service provides a creative \nopening that previously didn\u2019t exist. Disney+ is coming together at the \nexact same time as the insanely secretive Phase 4 plans that are very \nmuch still under wraps, and the synchronicity there is apparently \naffording some interesting new creative directions for the filmmakers \ninvolved.</p><p>Obviously a big factor in all of this are the \ncharacters that the Disney+ shows will be following \u2013 though Kevin Feige\n was only willing to confirm the existence of the Loki series that is being made first. Unlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe television programs that currently exist,\n which primary focus on introducing their own heroes and villains, the \nstreaming service material will be used to spotlight blockbuster names \nthat don\u2019t get the same kind of opportunities as, say, Doctor Strange, \nSpider-Man, or Black Panther.</p><p>\nTalking about the creative opportunities provided by what\u2019s being \ndeveloped, Kevin Feige noted that the real benefit of what we\u2019ll see \nfrom the Disney+ series is just a lot of storytelling real estate that \nwill allow character engagement that\u2019s simply not possible in a two \nhour-plus blockbuster. It won\u2019t necessarily be about \u201clower scale\u201d \nevents than what we see in cinemas three times per year, but instead \nabout bigger ideas. Said Feige, <br/></p><p>\n<i><b>\u201cI think what&rsquo;s fun is there&rsquo;s more time. There&rsquo;s more time to go further\n in depth with characters, and we try to do that in all of our films, \nbut in some of the films when there&rsquo;s so many characters they can&rsquo;t all \nget their own through lines.

Sure, \nthere has definitely been direct commentary about notable events, and \nspecific characters have appeared that confirm programs like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Daredevil, and Luke Cage\n are set in the same continuity, but the degree to which they are shown \nto be part of one giant franchise has been limited. That relationship \nbetween big and small screen material will change in a significant way \nvery soon, however, namely with the arrival of the upcoming Disney+ \nstreaming service, and its massive original content plans.</p><p>Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige has spoken in the past\n about the challenges that come with balancing continuity across \nmultiple mediums, namely that the pace of the storytelling in film and \ntelevision is so different that it makes them a conflict to sync. That, \nhowever, will not be an issue with the big plans for Disney\u2019s new \nentertainment hub. I sat down with Feige this past weekend during the \nLos Angeles press day for Captain Marvel, and during the interview he explained why programs like the upcoming Loki\n series will have a much more significant Marvel Cinematic Universe \nfeel. Confirming the opportunities for crossover, the executive/producer\n said,</p><p>\n<b><i>\u201cYes. Directly, yeah. One hundred percent. In large part it\u2019s because \nwe\u2019ve been working on Disney+ for quite a while now, at the exact same \ntime that we were working on the post-Avengers: Endgame MCU, and therefore for the first time ever developed them together.\u201c</i></b></p><p>Going back to the launch of Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. in 2013, Marvel Studios film and television have existed mostly as two separate entities working on two completely different schedules,\n but the creation of the new streaming service provides a creative \nopening that previously didn\u2019t exist. Disney+ is coming together at the \nexact same time as the insanely secretive Phase 4 plans that are very \nmuch still under wraps, and the synchronicity there is apparently \naffording some interesting new creative directions for the filmmakers \ninvolved.</p><p>Obviously a big factor in all of this are the \ncharacters that the Disney+ shows will be following \u2013 though Kevin Feige\n was only willing to confirm the existence of the Loki series that is being made first. Unlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe television programs that currently exist,\n which primary focus on introducing their own heroes and villains, the \nstreaming service material will be used to spotlight blockbuster names \nthat don\u2019t get the same kind of opportunities as, say, Doctor Strange, \nSpider-Man, or Black Panther.</p><p>\nTalking about the creative opportunities provided by what\u2019s being \ndeveloped, Kevin Feige noted that the real benefit of what we\u2019ll see \nfrom the Disney+ series is just a lot of storytelling real estate that \nwill allow character engagement that\u2019s simply not possible in a two \nhour-plus blockbuster. It won\u2019t necessarily be about \u201clower scale\u201d \nevents than what we see in cinemas three times per year, but instead \nabout bigger ideas. Said Feige, <br></p><p>\n<i><b>\u201cI think what\u2019s fun is there\u2019s more time. There\u2019s more time to go further\n in depth with characters, and we try to do that in all of our films, \nbut in some of the films when there\u2019s so many characters they can\u2019t all \nget their own through lines. And one of the many things that\u2019s exciting \nabout Disney+ is the opportunity to do both: to both give a level of \naction that people only see only rarely on television, but at the same \ntime go much, much deeper into a number of our characters and to fully \nintertwine them within the MCU.\u201d</b></i></p><p>\nAs mentioned, Marvel isn\u2019t confirming Disney+ plans for any characters other than Loki\n at present, though there have been reports saying that there are also \nprojects in the works that will center on Anthony Mackie and Sebastian \nStan\u2019s characters, Falcon and Winter Solider, as well as the pair played\n by Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, Scarlet Witch and Vision.
