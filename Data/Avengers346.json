Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t know who had reacted first or even at all. From the moment that Strange&rsquo;s sister had entered the room to when she flung him across as if Strange was some kind of teddy bear to her dropping into Steve&rsquo;s arms unconscious. It was too fast. I was honestly just staying in the shadows, watching everything unfold\u2013 there wasn&rsquo;t any time to react. My feet felt like they were stuck to the floors.</p><p>Going back to Y/N&rsquo;s first arrival, I have to say I was impressed at how she had handled herself. Of course, I knew it was all an act. There was something about her that pulled me in. <i>No, Buck. Stop it.\u00a0</i></p><p>When she faced the team, she held her ground. Not showing any emotions, despite probably feeling fear. <i>What is with people these days and capes though? </i>My eyes were glued, to be honest. Not just because of her outfit, please\u2013 I&rsquo;m not like that. Or her H/C flowing along her every movement. Okay, honestly. I just\u2013 don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t exactly put my finger on it. There was just something about her that was so alluring. So captivating.\u00a0</p><p>And when she was in rage, somehow I felt the pain radiating from her. Was that weird? Possible? It probably is, or I&rsquo;m just thinking too much into this. I even felt the room shake a little from her outburst, maybe she was dangerous. Or maybe, I&rsquo;m just imagining things. But as she collapsed into Steve&rsquo;s arms, I was actually worried for her. It was a lot to take in. I ignored the protests from the disapproving Clint Barton, he just couldn&rsquo;t understand. He should understand.\u00a0</p><p>She needed protection.\u00a0</p><p>A safe haven.\u00a0</p><p>Because once her vulnerable state gets manipulated by the wrong hands, then that&rsquo;s when we should start getting worried about her being dangerous. Because there&rsquo;s no going back from there.\u00a0</p><h2><b>CLINT BARTON P.O.V</b></h2><p>All eyes on Capt. when he returns from sending an unconscious Y/N Strange into her room. Am I the only one thinking that this could backfire on us? Should I have felt bad when the sob story came pouring out from Strange&rsquo;s mouth? No, she was a danger but no one could understand that.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;We need to discuss this.&rdquo; I announced, grabbing the attention from everyone. Nat just shakes her head. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to discuss, Clint?&rdquo; Nat asked, her brows furrowing.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;That she&rsquo;s a danger to everyone here! It isn&rsquo;t safe, not for us or the world!&rdquo; I said as I slammed my fist down onto the table.\u00a0</p><p>Steve begins his approach and I shook my head, already knowing what their choice was. &ldquo;We protect our own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our own!?&rdquo; I scoffed in disbelief and irritation, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not one of us, tell them Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Strange&rsquo;s family, Barton&hellip;&rdquo; Tony trailed off, bringing his hand up to rub the back of his neck awkwardly, &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s helped us through a lot, we have to help them.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Maybe we think this through, yes?&rdquo; Wanda spoke slowly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, that it&rsquo;s going to be dangerous, or that she&rsquo;s dangerous but we&rsquo;ve faced worst&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Her brother instantly agreed with her as he nodded, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s clearly scared and her life was just turned upside down, have a little compassion old man.&rdquo;</p><p>I just stare at them, obviously this was a battle I was going to lose. I shook my head, they had their valid points but they weren&rsquo;t thinking about safety. Not a single plan being discussed, not wanting to press the buttons of a girl that got her whole life turned upside down. Giving them one last look and a shake of my head, I stalked out of the room\u2013 wanting to cool myself down before I say anything I might regret.\u00a0</p><h2><b>LOKI LAUFEYSON P.O.V</b></h2><p>From the moment she barged in, I was captivated\u2013 intrigued. As anger consumed her, you can feel the energy radiating off of her. She <i>is </i>clearly capable of being powerful. As I watched her angered self unfold before me, it was obvious that she had not unlocked her inner Kree yet. The power she had by throwing her brother across the room was remarkable and with enough practice and knowledge of the matter, she would be able to beat even Thor himself.\u00a0</p><p>I listened disapprovingly at Clint Barton&rsquo;s protests, of course he would think she was a danger to them. Of course, the hell she is! She can be a strong warrior, that I know for sure. He was scared\u2013 probably because I&rsquo;ve given him a reason to be wary of such new comers that have certain abilities. He was right about Y/N being dangerous. Like I said, she is powerful\u2013 but right now she was in a vulnerable state with her life being turned upside down. They were clearly in danger if the Kree were after her, we could be running out of time already but pushing Y/N would be the wrong move. She could pull back and everything would be ruined.\u00a0</p><p>I need to discuss this with my brother, as it is obvious that none of the members of the team would bother listening to me. Though, with my knowledge of the Kree race\u2013 I would be able to try and reach out to Y/N more than the others.\u00a0</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but watch as she gets carried away by the Captain himself\u2013 I would have offered but clearly that wasn&rsquo;t an option. The team was still clearly wary of my presence. I must find a way though.\u00a0</p><p>There was something about her that made me frustrated, I have never really cared for someone. Much less a Midgardian or a Kree. Maybe, I&rsquo;m getting myself pulled because of her situation\u2013 something similar to mine. <i>No, don&rsquo;t let it get to your head.\u00a0</i></p><p>I have to find a way to reach out to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>She will need all the help she can get.\u00a0</p><h2><b>NATASHA ROMANOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>I felt my heart break at the scene before me. I had wanted to check on Y/N as everyone took off to either calm down or find some other thing to do. Clearly the events that took place today have been draining, for everyone.\u00a0</p><p>I watched as Y/N cries into the arms of Stephen, her whole body going limp as she clung onto her brother.\u00a0</p><p>Not wanting to intrude in a personal matter, I stalked away\u2013 making sure to leave as quietly as I could to not make my presence known. My thoughts go back to everything that had happened, my heart reaching out for Y/N. <i>Poor girl. </i>I wish Clint would understand, this was obviously difficult for Stephen.</p><p>My feet took me off towards the direction of Barton&rsquo;s quarters and I didn&rsquo;t even bother to knock for permission, I just barged myself in. There he sat, on the edge of his bed\u2013 clearly tense, but my entrance barely made him flinch.</p><p>&ldquo;You really need to get your emotions in check, Clint.&rdquo; I scolded him as I close the door behind me, not wanting anyone to intrude in our conversation.\u00a0</p><p>Clint lifted his shoulders up in a shrug as he looks up at me; eyes mixed with fear and regret, he probably felt guilty of the way he handled things but was conflicted. &ldquo;What do you want, Nat?&quot;\u00a0</p><p>Walking across the room and settling myself on the edge of the bed beside him, I place a hand on his back, &quot;I want you to understand the situation without getting mad. I understand what you mean, that it&rsquo;s dangerous but your words towards Stephen and his sister were as if you were pouring salt on open fresh wounds.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t even look at me anymore.\u00a0</p><p>I sighed. &ldquo;I understand that you&rsquo;re conflicted, and don&rsquo;t bother denying it. I know you too well&hellip;&rdquo; I trailed off, the corners of my mouth tugging to to a small smile, &ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is calm yourself down first, think things through because those two need our help and they won&rsquo;t be able to get it elsewhere. The team is a family, Strange has been a part of us for awhile now. We can&rsquo;t let him down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered underneath his breath.</p><h2><b>PIETRO MAXIMOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>Honestly what was all the commotion about? Who were they even talking about? Last I remembered, the rest of the team had been talking about a mission to stop Hydra while Wanda and I excused ourselves to the training room, and now they&rsquo;re suddenly huddled around talking about a sister and some Kree empire. It was all difficult to take such information, there were a lot of missing pieces to be filled\u2013 so I stood quietly at the side but the talk on Kree had interested me just a tiny bit, I suppose.\u00a0</p><p>Then <i>she</i> appeared, her face filled with anger. She was hurt. She had heard everything. This was bad. I run towards Wanda as she was closest to Doctor Strange after I had realized that the Y/N girl they had been talking about was lunging towards their direction. Instantly, I wrapped Wanda&rsquo;s waist with an arm and pulled her away to a corner. I watched the scene before me unfold, she was devastated. You can clearly see it in her face. I just knew I had to do something.</p><p>Rushing towards the supplies, I grabbed the sedative that I have become so familiar of lately because of missions. I quickly returned just in time to witness her throw Doctor Strange across the room without much effort coming out from her. My eyes widen from the this but I shrugged it off as I got myself near her\u2013 injecting the sedative. Captain America was instantly by my side as she collapsed. <i>Of course he would.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;</i>Quick thinking, Speedy.&rdquo; Tony said as he approached me, patting my back. I give him a nod, my eyes locked on the unconscious Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>Steve hoists her up into his arms, holding her close against his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her to her room.&rdquo; he announced and I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to tear my attention away until she was out of sight.\u00a0</p><h2><b>STEVE ROGERS P.O.V</b></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve always had the urge to protect the people. More so often the ones that I truly care about. Always keeping them close to keep an eye on them. I&rsquo;m usually often cautious of the ones I don&rsquo;t know anything of. She was a complete mystery to me but yet\u2013 there was this pull that made me want to protect her from the Kree that wanted to take her and even from Clint.\u00a0</p><p>Was I attracted to her? I don&rsquo;t know. Y/N is certainly beautiful. The moment she had entered the room before this whole mess started that has caused the team to go tense\u2013 I would have to admit, she did captivate me. It took me a few more seconds to regain my senses and stand my ground in case she was someone we were going to fight. An intruder or some sort. Though, I doubted that. I can&rsquo;t quite understand it yet, but there was something about her that clicked\u2013 made me trust her instantly.\u00a0</p><p>Even though she was consumed by her anger from the &lsquo;betrayal&rsquo; of her brother, I wasn&rsquo;t worried she might hurt anyone\u2013 I didn&rsquo;t think she was capable to do so. I was more worried she would hurt herself. So as I carried her close to my chest, I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at her facial features. She was calm when she slept. Innocence sweeping across her features. I couldn&rsquo;t stop staring\u2013 I barely knew her yet, she already had me wrapped around her finger. In a romantic way or a brotherly way? I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not sure just yet.\u00a0</p><p>So as I lay her down on her bed, I let out a sigh before brushing the hair off of her face. &ldquo;Stay strong, kid.&rdquo; I whispered softly before leaving the room and closing the door behind me, making my way back to the team.\u00a0</p><p>All I know is, there was a good chance that I&rsquo;ll be one of the few that will be protecting her.</p><h2><b>STEPHEN STRANGE P.O.V</b></h2><p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s help you up.&rdquo; Tony said as he approached me from the corner where Y/N had tossed me aside. I was in shock, barely able to make myself move from my position until Tony grips onto my arm and helps me up.</p><p>Guilt.\u00a0</p><p>That was what I was feeling. Pure guilt.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for it, Strange. You did what you had to do.&rdquo; he said, obviously my face said it all. I shook my head.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have kept this from her, then we wouldn&rsquo;t be having this problem. How could I have been so stupid?&rdquo;</p><p>I plopped myself down onto one of the couches and let out a sigh of irritation, and exhaustion. I didn&rsquo;t even care that my back was hurting from the impact of Y/N tossing me aside. I deserved it. I betrayed her. This wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if I would have just told her like the masters who trained her insisted.\u00a0</p><p>But, no. I was against that from the very beginning.\u00a0</p><p>What good would it have done? Telling a young girl that her parents were murdered and that she wasn&rsquo;t really my sister? That would have broken her.</p><p><i>No, she would have handled it. She&rsquo;s stronger than you think. </i>I&rsquo;m a fool. She probably hates me.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have known, Strange.&rdquo; Tony said one last time before leaving the room with my thoughts.\u00a0</p><p>I sighed and leaned back against the couch. I had a lot of thinking to do before approaching her.\u00a0</p><h2><b>THOR ODINSON</b></h2><p>Today was just a whole bunch of entertainment. As soon as everyone dispersed, Loki and I had decided to walk alongside towards our chambers\u2013 or is it bedroom the Midgardians call it?</p><p>As we walked, I couldn&rsquo;t help but glance over my brother with a raised eyebrow. He was obviously deep in thought, &ldquo;What has gotten you so silent, brother?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, &ldquo; The girl\u2013 she is clearly powerful than Strange had anticipated.&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded my head in response. The Strange girl\u2013 <i>huh, I suppose that&rsquo;s one catchy way of calling her, </i>obviously possessed such great power within her but it has yet to be shown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that none of the others will be able to be much help for the Strange girl. She\u2013 she is in dire need of assistance if she were to survive what is to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who do you have in mind, brother? Certainly, you are not contemplating on bringing her to Asgard. She will receive no help there.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>Once again, Loki was right. Asgardians\u2013 as much as they had knowledge of the Kree race, they were not going to be much help. &quot;I will seek help elsewhere\u2013 find connections, if I must.&rdquo;</p><p>He halted behind me, I spun around and raised a brow at his actions. &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re not suggesting of leaving me here with these people? I&rsquo;m positive they wouldn&rsquo;t even allow it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will speak to them but for now\u2013 you are the one who has more knowledge of the matter. You are the only one capable of addressing the girl with her situation. Try your best to stay out of trouble, brother. I will return shortly.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>TONY STARK</b></h2><p>Leaving the tension filled room was exactly what I needed. Everyone was on edge now\u2013 hoping to find answers as quick as possible just to ease the stress. I shook my head, I could feel it already\u2013 we&rsquo;ll be going on a rollercoaster ride for the next couple of months. Hopefully not.\u00a0</p><p>Finally in the comforts of my lab, I couldn&rsquo;t help but get my thoughts pulled back to the events from earlier\u2013 it was obviously distracting me that tinkering with new gadgets wasn&rsquo;t helping. Everyone was obviously taken back, not to mention Clint had blown his top off. We were the Avengers, obviously who wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a break soon. Breaks around here were impossible, a miracle most of the time if it happens.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N is obviously a danger, that much I agree with Clint but at the moment, she wasn&rsquo;t a threat. Her emotions were just sending her off, and Clint wasn&rsquo;t helping with his comments. It was best that everyone would ease her in, let her know that we were there for her when she needed.\u00a0</p><p>She is clearly powerful.\u00a0</p><p>Going back, I remember the conversation I had with Stephen just before this happened.\u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;You have to help me, Stark.&rdquo; he pleaded desperately. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re after her and I won&rsquo;t be able to protect her on my own. You and the team are the only ones I can think of to trust.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Thor&rsquo;s voice boomed across the room, snapping me from my thoughts. I looked over at his direction, my brows raising at his stance\u2013 his brother nowhere to be found.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you suppose to be taking care of your brother?&rdquo; I reminded him with a sly grin.\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled as he approached me. <i>Oh boy.</i>\u00a0I already have a bad feeling about this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I will be leaving my brother in your custody as I search help on the matter at hand. The Strange girl clearly needs all the help she could get, and I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be much. Loki has knowledge on the matter, allow him to approach the girl with the doctor&rsquo;s blessing. He can help. I know you aren&rsquo;t fond of the idea of Loki changing, but give it time. I believe he&rsquo;s truly changing for the better.&rdquo;</p><p>I sat there, completely dumbfounded at his words before shaking my head. Thor does, what Thor wants. There was obviously nothing stopping him. &ldquo;Fine, but I&rsquo;m calling in Banner just in case. He&rsquo;ll be the one keeping an eye on Loki. Not me.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>WANDA MAXIMOFF</b></h2><p>The only ones left were now me, Pietro and Vision. We sat there quietly, staring at absolutely nothing. The events that we had just witness had obviously put us all into shock. Not that we haven&rsquo;t been through worst things\u2013 but obviously it&rsquo;s still taking some time to get used to.\u00a0</p><p>I looked over my brother, trying my best to read his thoughts. He clearly had a soft spot for the girl\u2013 I can sense his care. &ldquo;You want to help her?&rdquo; He nodded in response, not even bothering to say a word to me. &ldquo;You stay away from her until we know more, she is clearly dangerous.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s up to you, sister.&rdquo; he muttered underneath his breath before disappearing from my sight. I rolled my eyes\u2013 this was going to be bad news already.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I know that you don&rsquo;t trust the girl, Wanda.&rdquo; Vision said interrupting my thoughts, &ldquo;but showing it to the girl will only cause more danger.&rdquo;</p><p>I stared at him for a second before shaking my head. Standing from where I was seated, I leave Vision to himself\u2013 walking towards the direction of my room.\u00a0</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t want to trust the girl, but we know nothing yet of her and she was clearly a danger, even to herself. My priority, will always be Pietro. And I&rsquo;ll be damned if he lets his feelings for a girl he barely knows get in the way.\u00a0</p><h2><b>VISION</b></h2><p>I watched Wanda leave in confusion. She was stubborn. I for one, am also wary of the girl that suddenly appeared in our lives.\u00a0</p><p>She had danger written all over her\u2013 but negative comments during a vulnerable state will only cause more danger. I had come to realize that everyone mostly kept to themselves for the time being, keeping their thoughts about the girl a secret until we find more answers. That is, except Barton who was very vocal about the situation at hand. I on the other hand, agree with Barton but being vocal about it wouldn&rsquo;t help. Most of the team wanted to wait and let the girl get settled in.</p><p>But, I&rsquo;m afraid\u2013 waiting wasn&rsquo;t an option. If the Kree had broken through the doctor&rsquo;s hidden manor, then clearly the tower wasn&rsquo;t safe. For anyone. I must approach Stark about this immediately. For all we know, the Kree are just waiting for the right time to attack. The tower was no place to hide the girl.\u00a0</p><p>The girl.</p><p>Such innocence. So vulnerable.\u00a0</p><p>Her whole world turned upside down less than a day. No one else to trust but her brother. I will keep my distance, but keep an eye on her in case something goes wrong.\u00a0Even we were no match for her in case her powers grow stronger each passing day.</p><p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be waiting.\u00a0</p><p>I can already sense the danger approaching.</p><hr><p><b>TTTAGGED: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_3melGmsW9rPiRnApzszcA\">@alessia&ndash;winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpj0O9f5F11r6rnLdRoKWOA\">@totobyafricaa</a></b></p>",

Honestly, I didn\u2019t know who had reacted first or even at all. From the moment that Strange\u2019s sister had entered the room to when she flung him across as if Strange was some kind of teddy bear to her dropping into Steve\u2019s arms unconscious. It was too fast. I was honestly just staying in the shadows, watching everything unfold\u2013 there wasn\u2019t any time to react. My feet felt like they were stuck to the floors.</p><p>Going back to Y/N\u2019s first arrival, I have to say I was impressed at how she had handled herself. Of course, I knew it was all an act. There was something about her that pulled me in. <i>No, Buck. Stop it.\u00a0</i></p><p>When she faced the team, she held her ground. Not showing any emotions, despite probably feeling fear. <i>What is with people these days and capes though? </i>My eyes were glued, to be honest. Not just because of her outfit, please\u2013 I\u2019m not like that. Or her H/C flowing along her every movement. Okay, honestly. I just\u2013 don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t exactly put my finger on it. There was just something about her that was so alluring. So captivating.\u00a0</p><p>And when she was in rage, somehow I felt the pain radiating from her. Was that weird? Possible? It probably is, or I\u2019m just thinking too much into this. I even felt the room shake a little from her outburst, maybe she was dangerous. Or maybe, I\u2019m just imagining things. But as she collapsed into Steve\u2019s arms, I was actually worried for her. It was a lot to take in. I ignored the protests from the disapproving Clint Barton, he just couldn\u2019t understand. He should understand.\u00a0</p><p>She needed protection.\u00a0</p><p>A safe haven.\u00a0</p><p>Because once her vulnerable state gets manipulated by the wrong hands, then that\u2019s when we should start getting worried about her being dangerous. Because there\u2019s no going back from there.\u00a0</p><h2><b>CLINT BARTON P.O.V</b></h2><p>All eyes on Capt. when he returns from sending an unconscious Y/N Strange into her room. Am I the only one thinking that this could backfire on us? Should I have felt bad when the sob story came pouring out from Strange\u2019s mouth? No, she was a danger but no one could understand that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe need to discuss this.\u201d I announced, grabbing the attention from everyone. Nat just shakes her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to discuss, Clint?\u201d Nat asked, her brows furrowing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s a danger to everyone here! It isn\u2019t safe, not for us or the world!\u201d I said as I slammed my fist down onto the table.\u00a0</p><p>Steve begins his approach and I shook my head, already knowing what their choice was. \u201cWe protect our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur own!?\u201d I scoffed in disbelief and irritation, \u201cShe\u2019s not one of us, tell them Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Strange\u2019s family, Barton\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off, bringing his hand up to rub the back of his neck awkwardly, \u201cAnd he\u2019s helped us through a lot, we have to help them.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Maybe we think this through, yes?\u201d Wanda spoke slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s true, that it\u2019s going to be dangerous, or that she\u2019s dangerous but we\u2019ve faced worst\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her brother instantly agreed with her as he nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s clearly scared and her life was just turned upside down, have a little compassion old man.\u201d</p><p>I just stare at them, obviously this was a battle I was going to lose. I shook my head, they had their valid points but they weren\u2019t thinking about safety. Not a single plan being discussed, not wanting to press the buttons of a girl that got her whole life turned upside down. Giving them one last look and a shake of my head, I stalked out of the room\u2013 wanting to cool myself down before I say anything I might regret.\u00a0</p><h2><b>LOKI LAUFEYSON P.O.V</b></h2><p>From the moment she barged in, I was captivated\u2013 intrigued. As anger consumed her, you can feel the energy radiating off of her. She <i>is </i>clearly capable of being powerful. As I watched her angered self unfold before me, it was obvious that she had not unlocked her inner Kree yet. The power she had by throwing her brother across the room was remarkable and with enough practice and knowledge of the matter, she would be able to beat even Thor himself.\u00a0</p><p>I listened disapprovingly at Clint Barton\u2019s protests, of course he would think she was a danger to them. Of course, the hell she is! She can be a strong warrior, that I know for sure. He was scared\u2013 probably because I\u2019ve given him a reason to be wary of such new comers that have certain abilities. He was right about Y/N being dangerous. Like I said, she is powerful\u2013 but right now she was in a vulnerable state with her life being turned upside down. They were clearly in danger if the Kree were after her, we could be running out of time already but pushing Y/N would be the wrong move. She could pull back and everything would be ruined.\u00a0</p><p>I need to discuss this with my brother, as it is obvious that none of the members of the team would bother listening to me. Though, with my knowledge of the Kree race\u2013 I would be able to try and reach out to Y/N more than the others.\u00a0</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but watch as she gets carried away by the Captain himself\u2013 I would have offered but clearly that wasn\u2019t an option. The team was still clearly wary of my presence. I must find a way though.\u00a0</p><p>There was something about her that made me frustrated, I have never really cared for someone. Much less a Midgardian or a Kree. Maybe, I\u2019m getting myself pulled because of her situation\u2013 something similar to mine. <i>No, don\u2019t let it get to your head.\u00a0</i></p><p>I have to find a way to reach out to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>She will need all the help she can get.\u00a0</p><h2><b>NATASHA ROMANOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>I felt my heart break at the scene before me. I had wanted to check on Y/N as everyone took off to either calm down or find some other thing to do. Clearly the events that took place today have been draining, for everyone.\u00a0</p><p>I watched as Y/N cries into the arms of Stephen, her whole body going limp as she clung onto her brother.\u00a0</p><p>Not wanting to intrude in a personal matter, I stalked away\u2013 making sure to leave as quietly as I could to not make my presence known. My thoughts go back to everything that had happened, my heart reaching out for Y/N. <i>Poor girl. </i>I wish Clint would understand, this was obviously difficult for Stephen.</p><p>My feet took me off towards the direction of Barton\u2019s quarters and I didn\u2019t even bother to knock for permission, I just barged myself in. There he sat, on the edge of his bed\u2013 clearly tense, but my entrance barely made him flinch.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to get your emotions in check, Clint.\u201d I scolded him as I close the door behind me, not wanting anyone to intrude in our conversation.\u00a0</p><p>Clint lifted his shoulders up in a shrug as he looks up at me; eyes mixed with fear and regret, he probably felt guilty of the way he handled things but was conflicted. \u201cWhat do you want, Nat?\"\u00a0</p><p>Walking across the room and settling myself on the edge of the bed beside him, I place a hand on his back, \"I want you to understand the situation without getting mad. I understand what you mean, that it\u2019s dangerous but your words towards Stephen and his sister were as if you were pouring salt on open fresh wounds.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even look at me anymore.\u00a0</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI understand that you\u2019re conflicted, and don\u2019t bother denying it. I know you too well\u2026\u201d I trailed off, the corners of my mouth tugging to to a small smile, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is calm yourself down first, think things through because those two need our help and they won\u2019t be able to get it elsewhere. The team is a family, Strange has been a part of us for awhile now. We can\u2019t let him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d he whispered underneath his breath.</p><h2><b>PIETRO MAXIMOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>Honestly what was all the commotion about? Who were they even talking about? Last I remembered, the rest of the team had been talking about a mission to stop Hydra while Wanda and I excused ourselves to the training room, and now they\u2019re suddenly huddled around talking about a sister and some Kree empire. It was all difficult to take such information, there were a lot of missing pieces to be filled\u2013 so I stood quietly at the side but the talk on Kree had interested me just a tiny bit, I suppose.\u00a0</p><p>Then <i>she</i> appeared, her face filled with anger. She was hurt. She had heard everything. This was bad. I run towards Wanda as she was closest to Doctor Strange after I had realized that the Y/N girl they had been talking about was lunging towards their direction. Instantly, I wrapped Wanda\u2019s waist with an arm and pulled her away to a corner. I watched the scene before me unfold, she was devastated. You can clearly see it in her face. I just knew I had to do something.</p><p>Rushing towards the supplies, I grabbed the sedative that I have become so familiar of lately because of missions. I quickly returned just in time to witness her throw Doctor Strange across the room without much effort coming out from her. My eyes widen from the this but I shrugged it off as I got myself near her\u2013 injecting the sedative. Captain America was instantly by my side as she collapsed. <i>Of course he would.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201c</i>Quick thinking, Speedy.\u201d Tony said as he approached me, patting my back. I give him a nod, my eyes locked on the unconscious Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>Steve hoists her up into his arms, holding her close against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll take her to her room.\u201d he announced and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tear my attention away until she was out of sight.\u00a0</p><h2><b>STEVE ROGERS P.O.V</b></h2><p>I\u2019ve always had the urge to protect the people. More so often the ones that I truly care about. Always keeping them close to keep an eye on them. I\u2019m usually often cautious of the ones I don\u2019t know anything of. She was a complete mystery to me but yet\u2013 there was this pull that made me want to protect her from the Kree that wanted to take her and even from Clint.\u00a0</p><p>Was I attracted to her? I don\u2019t know. Y/N is certainly beautiful. The moment she had entered the room before this whole mess started that has caused the team to go tense\u2013 I would have to admit, she did captivate me. It took me a few more seconds to regain my senses and stand my ground in case she was someone we were going to fight. An intruder or some sort. Though, I doubted that. I can\u2019t quite understand it yet, but there was something about her that clicked\u2013 made me trust her instantly.\u00a0</p><p>Even though she was consumed by her anger from the \u2018betrayal\u2019 of her brother, I wasn\u2019t worried she might hurt anyone\u2013 I didn\u2019t think she was capable to do so. I was more worried she would hurt herself. So as I carried her close to my chest, I couldn\u2019t help but stare at her facial features. She was calm when she slept. Innocence sweeping across her features. I couldn\u2019t stop staring\u2013 I barely knew her yet, she already had me wrapped around her finger. In a romantic way or a brotherly way? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure just yet.\u00a0</p><p>So as I lay her down on her bed, I let out a sigh before brushing the hair off of her face. \u201cStay strong, kid.\u201d I whispered softly before leaving the room and closing the door behind me, making my way back to the team.\u00a0</p><p>All I know is, there was a good chance that I\u2019ll be one of the few that will be protecting her.</p><h2><b>STEPHEN STRANGE P.O.V</b></h2><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s help you up.\u201d Tony said as he approached me from the corner where Y/N had tossed me aside. I was in shock, barely able to make myself move from my position until Tony grips onto my arm and helps me up.</p><p>Guilt.\u00a0</p><p>That was what I was feeling. Pure guilt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up for it, Strange. You did what you had to do.\u201d he said, obviously my face said it all. I shook my head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have kept this from her, then we wouldn\u2019t be having this problem. How could I have been so stupid?\u201d</p><p>I plopped myself down onto one of the couches and let out a sigh of irritation, and exhaustion. I didn\u2019t even care that my back was hurting from the impact of Y/N tossing me aside. I deserved it. I betrayed her. This wouldn\u2019t have happened if I would have just told her like the masters who trained her insisted.\u00a0</p><p>But, no. I was against that from the very beginning.\u00a0</p><p>What good would it have done? Telling a young girl that her parents were murdered and that she wasn\u2019t really my sister? That would have broken her.</p><p><i>No, she would have handled it. She\u2019s stronger than you think. </i>I\u2019m a fool. She probably hates me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known, Strange.\u201d Tony said one last time before leaving the room with my thoughts.\u00a0</p><p>I sighed and leaned back against the couch. I had a lot of thinking to do before approaching her.\u00a0</p><h2><b>THOR ODINSON</b></h2><p>Today was just a whole bunch of entertainment. As soon as everyone dispersed, Loki and I had decided to walk alongside towards our chambers\u2013 or is it bedroom the Midgardians call it?</p><p>As we walked, I couldn\u2019t help but glance over my brother with a raised eyebrow. He was obviously deep in thought, \u201cWhat has gotten you so silent, brother?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201c The girl\u2013 she is clearly powerful than Strange had anticipated.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head in response. The Strange girl\u2013 <i>huh, I suppose that\u2019s one catchy way of calling her, </i>obviously possessed such great power within her but it has yet to be shown. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that none of the others will be able to be much help for the Strange girl. She\u2013 she is in dire need of assistance if she were to survive what is to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who do you have in mind, brother? Certainly, you are not contemplating on bringing her to Asgard. She will receive no help there.\"\u00a0</p><p>Once again, Loki was right. Asgardians\u2013 as much as they had knowledge of the Kree race, they were not going to be much help. \"I will seek help elsewhere\u2013 find connections, if I must.\u201d</p><p>He halted behind me, I spun around and raised a brow at his actions. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not suggesting of leaving me here with these people? I\u2019m positive they wouldn\u2019t even allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will speak to them but for now\u2013 you are the one who has more knowledge of the matter. You are the only one capable of addressing the girl with her situation. Try your best to stay out of trouble, brother. I will return shortly.\u201d</p><h2><b>TONY STARK</b></h2><p>Leaving the tension filled room was exactly what I needed. Everyone was on edge now\u2013 hoping to find answers as quick as possible just to ease the stress. I shook my head, I could feel it already\u2013 we\u2019ll be going on a rollercoaster ride for the next couple of months. Hopefully not.\u00a0</p><p>Finally in the comforts of my lab, I couldn\u2019t help but get my thoughts pulled back to the events from earlier\u2013 it was obviously distracting me that tinkering with new gadgets wasn\u2019t helping. Everyone was obviously taken back, not to mention Clint had blown his top off. We were the Avengers, obviously who wouldn\u2019t be able to get a break soon. Breaks around here were impossible, a miracle most of the time if it happens.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N is obviously a danger, that much I agree with Clint but at the moment, she wasn\u2019t a threat. Her emotions were just sending her off, and Clint wasn\u2019t helping with his comments. It was best that everyone would ease her in, let her know that we were there for her when she needed.\u00a0</p><p>She is clearly powerful.\u00a0</p><p>Going back, I remember the conversation I had with Stephen just before this happened.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYou have to help me, Stark.\u201d he pleaded desperately. \u201cThey\u2019re after her and I won\u2019t be able to protect her on my own. You and the team are the only ones I can think of to trust.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cStark.\u201d Thor\u2019s voice boomed across the room, snapping me from my thoughts. I looked over at his direction, my brows raising at his stance\u2013 his brother nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you suppose to be taking care of your brother?\u201d I reminded him with a sly grin.\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled as he approached me. <i>Oh boy.</i>\u00a0I already have a bad feeling about this. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I will be leaving my brother in your custody as I search help on the matter at hand. The Strange girl clearly needs all the help she could get, and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be much. Loki has knowledge on the matter, allow him to approach the girl with the doctor\u2019s blessing. He can help. I know you aren\u2019t fond of the idea of Loki changing, but give it time. I believe he\u2019s truly changing for the better.\u201d</p><p>I sat there, completely dumbfounded at his words before shaking my head. Thor does, what Thor wants. There was obviously nothing stopping him. \u201cFine, but I\u2019m calling in Banner just in case. He\u2019ll be the one keeping an eye on Loki. Not me.\u201d</p><h2><b>WANDA MAXIMOFF</b></h2><p>The only ones left were now me, Pietro and Vision. We sat there quietly, staring at absolutely nothing. The events that we had just witness had obviously put us all into shock. Not that we haven\u2019t been through worst things\u2013 but obviously it\u2019s still taking some time to get used to.\u00a0</p><p>I looked over my brother, trying my best to read his thoughts. He clearly had a soft spot for the girl\u2013 I can sense his care. \u201cYou want to help her?\u201d He nodded in response, not even bothering to say a word to me. \u201cYou stay away from her until we know more, she is clearly dangerous.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s up to you, sister.\u201d he muttered underneath his breath before disappearing from my sight. I rolled my eyes\u2013 this was going to be bad news already.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know that you don\u2019t trust the girl, Wanda.\u201d Vision said interrupting my thoughts, \u201cbut showing it to the girl will only cause more danger.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a second before shaking my head. Standing from where I was seated, I leave Vision to himself\u2013 walking towards the direction of my room.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t want to trust the girl, but we know nothing yet of her and she was clearly a danger, even to herself. My priority, will always be Pietro. And I\u2019ll be damned if he lets his feelings for a girl he barely knows get in the way.\u00a0</p><h2><b>VISION</b></h2><p>I watched Wanda leave in confusion. She was stubborn. I for one, am also wary of the girl that suddenly appeared in our lives.\u00a0</p><p>She had danger written all over her\u2013 but negative comments during a vulnerable state will only cause more danger. I had come to realize that everyone mostly kept to themselves for the time being, keeping their thoughts about the girl a secret until we find more answers. That is, except Barton who was very vocal about the situation at hand. I on the other hand, agree with Barton but being vocal about it wouldn\u2019t help. Most of the team wanted to wait and let the girl get settled in.</p><p>But, I\u2019m afraid\u2013 waiting wasn\u2019t an option. If the Kree had broken through the doctor\u2019s hidden manor, then clearly the tower wasn\u2019t safe. For anyone. I must approach Stark about this immediately. For all we know, the Kree are just waiting for the right time to attack. The tower was no place to hide the girl.\u00a0</p><p>The girl.</p><p>Such innocence. So vulnerable.\u00a0</p><p>Her whole world turned upside down less than a day. No one else to trust but her brother. I will keep my distance, but keep an eye on her in case something goes wrong.\u00a0Even we were no match for her in case her powers grow stronger each passing day.</p><p>We shouldn\u2019t be waiting.\u00a0</p><p>I can already sense the danger approaching.</p><hr><p><b>TTTAGGED: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_3melGmsW9rPiRnApzszcA\">@alessia\u2013winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpj0O9f5F11r6rnLdRoKWOA\">@totobyafricaa</a></b></p></p>",

Honestly, I didn\u2019t know who had reacted first or even at all. From the moment that Strange\u2019s sister had entered the room to when she flung him across as if Strange was some kind of teddy bear to her dropping into Steve\u2019s arms unconscious. It was too fast. I was honestly just staying in the shadows, watching everything unfold\u2013 there wasn\u2019t any time to react. My feet felt like they were stuck to the floors.</p><p>Going back to Y/N\u2019s first arrival, I have to say I was impressed at how she had handled herself. Of course, I knew it was all an act. There was something about her that pulled me in. <i>No, Buck. Stop it.\u00a0</i></p><p>When she faced the team, she held her ground. Not showing any emotions, despite probably feeling fear. <i>What is with people these days and capes though? </i>My eyes were glued, to be honest. Not just because of her outfit, please\u2013 I\u2019m not like that. Or her H/C flowing along her every movement. Okay, honestly. I just\u2013 don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t exactly put my finger on it. There was just something about her that was so alluring. So captivating.\u00a0</p><p>And when she was in rage, somehow I felt the pain radiating from her. Was that weird? Possible? It probably is, or I\u2019m just thinking too much into this. I even felt the room shake a little from her outburst, maybe she was dangerous. Or maybe, I\u2019m just imagining things. But as she collapsed into Steve\u2019s arms, I was actually worried for her. It was a lot to take in. I ignored the protests from the disapproving Clint Barton, he just couldn\u2019t understand. He should understand.\u00a0</p><p>She needed protection.\u00a0</p><p>A safe haven.\u00a0</p><p>Because once her vulnerable state gets manipulated by the wrong hands, then that\u2019s when we should start getting worried about her being dangerous. Because there\u2019s no going back from there.\u00a0</p><h2><b>CLINT BARTON P.O.V</b></h2><p>All eyes on Capt. when he returns from sending an unconscious Y/N Strange into her room. Am I the only one thinking that this could backfire on us? Should I have felt bad when the sob story came pouring out from Strange\u2019s mouth? No, she was a danger but no one could understand that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe need to discuss this.\u201d I announced, grabbing the attention from everyone. Nat just shakes her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to discuss, Clint?\u201d Nat asked, her brows furrowing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s a danger to everyone here! It isn\u2019t safe, not for us or the world!\u201d I said as I slammed my fist down onto the table.\u00a0</p><p>Steve begins his approach and I shook my head, already knowing what their choice was. \u201cWe protect our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur own!?\u201d I scoffed in disbelief and irritation, \u201cShe\u2019s not one of us, tell them Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Strange\u2019s family, Barton\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off, bringing his hand up to rub the back of his neck awkwardly, \u201cAnd he\u2019s helped us through a lot, we have to help them.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Maybe we think this through, yes?\u201d Wanda spoke slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s true, that it\u2019s going to be dangerous, or that she\u2019s dangerous but we\u2019ve faced worst\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her brother instantly agreed with her as he nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s clearly scared and her life was just turned upside down, have a little compassion old man.\u201d</p><p>I just stare at them, obviously this was a battle I was going to lose. I shook my head, they had their valid points but they weren\u2019t thinking about safety. Not a single plan being discussed, not wanting to press the buttons of a girl that got her whole life turned upside down. Giving them one last look and a shake of my head, I stalked out of the room\u2013 wanting to cool myself down before I say anything I might regret.\u00a0</p><h2><b>LOKI LAUFEYSON P.O.V</b></h2><p>From the moment she barged in, I was captivated\u2013 intrigued. As anger consumed her, you can feel the energy radiating off of her. She <i>is </i>clearly capable of being powerful. As I watched her angered self unfold before me, it was obvious that she had not unlocked her inner Kree yet. The power she had by throwing her brother across the room was remarkable and with enough practice and knowledge of the matter, she would be able to beat even Thor himself.\u00a0</p><p>I listened disapprovingly at Clint Barton\u2019s protests, of course he would think she was a danger to them. Of course, the hell she is! She can be a strong warrior, that I know for sure. He was scared\u2013 probably because I\u2019ve given him a reason to be wary of such new comers that have certain abilities. He was right about Y/N being dangerous. Like I said, she is powerful\u2013 but right now she was in a vulnerable state with her life being turned upside down. They were clearly in danger if the Kree were after her, we could be running out of time already but pushing Y/N would be the wrong move. She could pull back and everything would be ruined.\u00a0</p><p>I need to discuss this with my brother, as it is obvious that none of the members of the team would bother listening to me. Though, with my knowledge of the Kree race\u2013 I would be able to try and reach out to Y/N more than the others.\u00a0</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but watch as she gets carried away by the Captain himself\u2013 I would have offered but clearly that wasn\u2019t an option. The team was still clearly wary of my presence. I must find a way though.\u00a0</p><p>There was something about her that made me frustrated, I have never really cared for someone. Much less a Midgardian or a Kree. Maybe, I\u2019m getting myself pulled because of her situation\u2013 something similar to mine. <i>No, don\u2019t let it get to your head.\u00a0</i></p><p>I have to find a way to reach out to Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>She will need all the help she can get.\u00a0</p><h2><b>NATASHA ROMANOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>I felt my heart break at the scene before me. I had wanted to check on Y/N as everyone took off to either calm down or find some other thing to do. Clearly the events that took place today have been draining, for everyone.\u00a0</p><p>I watched as Y/N cries into the arms of Stephen, her whole body going limp as she clung onto her brother.\u00a0</p><p>Not wanting to intrude in a personal matter, I stalked away\u2013 making sure to leave as quietly as I could to not make my presence known. My thoughts go back to everything that had happened, my heart reaching out for Y/N. <i>Poor girl. </i>I wish Clint would understand, this was obviously difficult for Stephen.</p><p>My feet took me off towards the direction of Barton\u2019s quarters and I didn\u2019t even bother to knock for permission, I just barged myself in. There he sat, on the edge of his bed\u2013 clearly tense, but my entrance barely made him flinch.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to get your emotions in check, Clint.\u201d I scolded him as I close the door behind me, not wanting anyone to intrude in our conversation.\u00a0</p><p>Clint lifted his shoulders up in a shrug as he looks up at me; eyes mixed with fear and regret, he probably felt guilty of the way he handled things but was conflicted. \u201cWhat do you want, Nat?\"\u00a0</p><p>Walking across the room and settling myself on the edge of the bed beside him, I place a hand on his back, \"I want you to understand the situation without getting mad. I understand what you mean, that it\u2019s dangerous but your words towards Stephen and his sister were as if you were pouring salt on open fresh wounds.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even look at me anymore.\u00a0</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI understand that you\u2019re conflicted, and don\u2019t bother denying it. I know you too well\u2026\u201d I trailed off, the corners of my mouth tugging to to a small smile, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is calm yourself down first, think things through because those two need our help and they won\u2019t be able to get it elsewhere. The team is a family, Strange has been a part of us for awhile now. We can\u2019t let him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d he whispered underneath his breath.</p><h2><b>PIETRO MAXIMOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>Honestly what was all the commotion about? Who were they even talking about? Last I remembered, the rest of the team had been talking about a mission to stop Hydra while Wanda and I excused ourselves to the training room, and now they\u2019re suddenly huddled around talking about a sister and some Kree empire. It was all difficult to take such information, there were a lot of missing pieces to be filled\u2013 so I stood quietly at the side but the talk on Kree had interested me just a tiny bit, I suppose.\u00a0</p><p>Then <i>she</i> appeared, her face filled with anger. She was hurt. She had heard everything. This was bad. I run towards Wanda as she was closest to Doctor Strange after I had realized that the Y/N girl they had been talking about was lunging towards their direction. Instantly, I wrapped Wanda\u2019s waist with an arm and pulled her away to a corner. I watched the scene before me unfold, she was devastated. You can clearly see it in her face. I just knew I had to do something.</p><p>Rushing towards the supplies, I grabbed the sedative that I have become so familiar of lately because of missions. I quickly returned just in time to witness her throw Doctor Strange across the room without much effort coming out from her. My eyes widen from the this but I shrugged it off as I got myself near her\u2013 injecting the sedative. Captain America was instantly by my side as she collapsed. <i>Of course he would.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201c</i>Quick thinking, Speedy.\u201d Tony said as he approached me, patting my back. I give him a nod, my eyes locked on the unconscious Y/N.\u00a0</p><p>Steve hoists her up into his arms, holding her close against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll take her to her room.\u201d he announced and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tear my attention away until she was out of sight.\u00a0</p><h2><b>STEVE ROGERS P.O.V</b></h2><p>I\u2019ve always had the urge to protect the people. More so often the ones that I truly care about. Always keeping them close to keep an eye on them. I\u2019m usually often cautious of the ones I don\u2019t know anything of. She was a complete mystery to me but yet\u2013 there was this pull that made me want to protect her from the Kree that wanted to take her and even from Clint.\u00a0</p><p>Was I attracted to her? I don\u2019t know. Y/N is certainly beautiful. The moment she had entered the room before this whole mess started that has caused the team to go tense\u2013 I would have to admit, she did captivate me. It took me a few more seconds to regain my senses and stand my ground in case she was someone we were going to fight. An intruder or some sort. Though, I doubted that. I can\u2019t quite understand it yet, but there was something about her that clicked\u2013 made me trust her instantly.\u00a0</p><p>Even though she was consumed by her anger from the \u2018betrayal\u2019 of her brother, I wasn\u2019t worried she might hurt anyone\u2013 I didn\u2019t think she was capable to do so. I was more worried she would hurt herself. So as I carried her close to my chest, I couldn\u2019t help but stare at her facial features. She was calm when she slept. Innocence sweeping across her features. I couldn\u2019t stop staring\u2013 I barely knew her yet, she already had me wrapped around her finger. In a romantic way or a brotherly way? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure just yet.\u00a0</p><p>So as I lay her down on her bed, I let out a sigh before brushing the hair off of her face. \u201cStay strong, kid.\u201d I whispered softly before leaving the room and closing the door behind me, making my way back to the team.\u00a0</p><p>All I know is, there was a good chance that I\u2019ll be one of the few that will be protecting her.</p><h2><b>STEPHEN STRANGE P.O.V</b></h2><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s help you up.\u201d Tony said as he approached me from the corner where Y/N had tossed me aside. I was in shock, barely able to make myself move from my position until Tony grips onto my arm and helps me up.</p><p>Guilt.\u00a0</p><p>That was what I was feeling. Pure guilt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up for it, Strange. You did what you had to do.\u201d he said, obviously my face said it all. I shook my head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have kept this from her, then we wouldn\u2019t be having this problem. How could I have been so stupid?\u201d</p><p>I plopped myself down onto one of the couches and let out a sigh of irritation, and exhaustion. I didn\u2019t even care that my back was hurting from the impact of Y/N tossing me aside. I deserved it. I betrayed her. This wouldn\u2019t have happened if I would have just told her like the masters who trained her insisted.\u00a0</p><p>But, no. I was against that from the very beginning.\u00a0</p><p>What good would it have done? Telling a young girl that her parents were murdered and that she wasn\u2019t really my sister? That would have broken her.</p><p><i>No, she would have handled it. She\u2019s stronger than you think. </i>I\u2019m a fool. She probably hates me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known, Strange.\u201d Tony said one last time before leaving the room with my thoughts.\u00a0</p><p>I sighed and leaned back against the couch. I had a lot of thinking to do before approaching her.\u00a0</p><h2><b>THOR ODINSON</b></h2><p>Today was just a whole bunch of entertainment. As soon as everyone dispersed, Loki and I had decided to walk alongside towards our chambers\u2013 or is it bedroom the Midgardians call it?</p><p>As we walked, I couldn\u2019t help but glance over my brother with a raised eyebrow. He was obviously deep in thought, \u201cWhat has gotten you so silent, brother?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201c The girl\u2013 she is clearly powerful than Strange had anticipated.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head in response. The Strange girl\u2013 <i>huh, I suppose that\u2019s one catchy way of calling her, </i>obviously possessed such great power within her but it has yet to be shown. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that none of the others will be able to be much help for the Strange girl. She\u2013 she is in dire need of assistance if she were to survive what is to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who do you have in mind, brother? Certainly, you are not contemplating on bringing her to Asgard. She will receive no help there.\"\u00a0</p><p>Once again, Loki was right. Asgardians\u2013 as much as they had knowledge of the Kree race, they were not going to be much help. \"I will seek help elsewhere\u2013 find connections, if I must.\u201d</p><p>He halted behind me, I spun around and raised a brow at his actions. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not suggesting of leaving me here with these people? I\u2019m positive they wouldn\u2019t even allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will speak to them but for now\u2013 you are the one who has more knowledge of the matter. You are the only one capable of addressing the girl with her situation. Try your best to stay out of trouble, brother. I will return shortly.\u201d</p><h2><b>TONY STARK</b></h2><p>Leaving the tension filled room was exactly what I needed. Everyone was on edge now\u2013 hoping to find answers as quick as possible just to ease the stress. I shook my head, I could feel it already\u2013 we\u2019ll be going on a rollercoaster ride for the next couple of months. Hopefully not.\u00a0</p><p>Finally in the comforts of my lab, I couldn\u2019t help but get my thoughts pulled back to the events from earlier\u2013 it was obviously distracting me that tinkering with new gadgets wasn\u2019t helping. Everyone was obviously taken back, not to mention Clint had blown his top off. We were the Avengers, obviously who wouldn\u2019t be able to get a break soon. Breaks around here were impossible, a miracle most of the time if it happens.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N is obviously a danger, that much I agree with Clint but at the moment, she wasn\u2019t a threat. Her emotions were just sending her off, and Clint wasn\u2019t helping with his comments. It was best that everyone would ease her in, let her know that we were there for her when she needed.\u00a0</p><p>She is clearly powerful.\u00a0</p><p>Going back, I remember the conversation I had with Stephen just before this happened.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYou have to help me, Stark.\u201d he pleaded desperately. \u201cThey\u2019re after her and I won\u2019t be able to protect her on my own. You and the team are the only ones I can think of to trust.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cStark.\u201d Thor\u2019s voice boomed across the room, snapping me from my thoughts. I looked over at his direction, my brows raising at his stance\u2013 his brother nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you suppose to be taking care of your brother?\u201d I reminded him with a sly grin.\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled as he approached me. <i>Oh boy.</i>\u00a0I already have a bad feeling about this. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I will be leaving my brother in your custody as I search help on the matter at hand. The Strange girl clearly needs all the help she could get, and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be much. Loki has knowledge on the matter, allow him to approach the girl with the doctor\u2019s blessing. He can help. I know you aren\u2019t fond of the idea of Loki changing, but give it time. I believe he\u2019s truly changing for the better.\u201d</p><p>I sat there, completely dumbfounded at his words before shaking my head. Thor does, what Thor wants. There was obviously nothing stopping him. \u201cFine, but I\u2019m calling in Banner just in case. He\u2019ll be the one keeping an eye on Loki. Not me.\u201d</p><h2><b>WANDA MAXIMOFF</b></h2><p>The only ones left were now me, Pietro and Vision. We sat there quietly, staring at absolutely nothing. The events that we had just witness had obviously put us all into shock. Not that we haven\u2019t been through worst things\u2013 but obviously it\u2019s still taking some time to get used to.\u00a0</p><p>I looked over my brother, trying my best to read his thoughts. He clearly had a soft spot for the girl\u2013 I can sense his care. \u201cYou want to help her?\u201d He nodded in response, not even bothering to say a word to me. \u201cYou stay away from her until we know more, she is clearly dangerous.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s up to you, sister.\u201d he muttered underneath his breath before disappearing from my sight. I rolled my eyes\u2013 this was going to be bad news already.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know that you don\u2019t trust the girl, Wanda.\u201d Vision said interrupting my thoughts, \u201cbut showing it to the girl will only cause more danger.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a second before shaking my head. Standing from where I was seated, I leave Vision to himself\u2013 walking towards the direction of my room.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t want to trust the girl, but we know nothing yet of her and she was clearly a danger, even to herself. My priority, will always be Pietro. And I\u2019ll be damned if he lets his feelings for a girl he barely knows get in the way.\u00a0</p><h2><b>VISION</b></h2><p>I watched Wanda leave in confusion. She was stubborn. I for one, am also wary of the girl that suddenly appeared in our lives.\u00a0</p><p>She had danger written all over her\u2013 but negative comments during a vulnerable state will only cause more danger. I had come to realize that everyone mostly kept to themselves for the time being, keeping their thoughts about the girl a secret until we find more answers. That is, except Barton who was very vocal about the situation at hand. I on the other hand, agree with Barton but being vocal about it wouldn\u2019t help. Most of the team wanted to wait and let the girl get settled in.</p><p>But, I\u2019m afraid\u2013 waiting wasn\u2019t an option. If the Kree had broken through the doctor\u2019s hidden manor, then clearly the tower wasn\u2019t safe. For anyone. I must approach Stark about this immediately. For all we know, the Kree are just waiting for the right time to attack. The tower was no place to hide the girl.\u00a0</p><p>The girl.</p><p>Such innocence. So vulnerable.\u00a0</p><p>Her whole world turned upside down less than a day. No one else to trust but her brother. I will keep my distance, but keep an eye on her in case something goes wrong.\u00a0Even we were no match for her in case her powers grow stronger each passing day.</p><p>We shouldn\u2019t be waiting.\u00a0</p><p>I can already sense the danger approaching.</p><hr><p><b>TTTAGGED: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_3melGmsW9rPiRnApzszcA\">@alessia\u2013winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpj0O9f5F11r6rnLdRoKWOA\">@totobyafricaa</a></b></p></p>",

Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t know who had reacted first or even at all. From the moment that Strange&rsquo;s sister had entered the room to when she flung him across as if Strange was some kind of teddy bear to her dropping into Steve&rsquo;s arms unconscious. It was too fast. I was honestly just staying in the shadows, watching everything unfold&ndash; there wasn&rsquo;t any time to react. My feet felt like they were stuck to the floors.</p><p>Going back to Y/N&rsquo;s first arrival, I have to say I was impressed at how she had handled herself. Of course, I knew it was all an act. There was something about her that pulled me in. <i>No, Buck. Stop it.&nbsp;</i></p><p>When she faced the team, she held her ground. Not showing any emotions, despite probably feeling fear. <i>What is with people these days and capes though? </i>My eyes were glued, to be honest. Not just because of her outfit, please&ndash; I&rsquo;m not like that. Or her H/C flowing along her every movement. Okay, honestly. I just&ndash; don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t exactly put my finger on it. There was just something about her that was so alluring. So captivating.&nbsp;</p><p>And when she was in rage, somehow I felt the pain radiating from her. Was that weird? Possible? It probably is, or I&rsquo;m just thinking too much into this. I even felt the room shake a little from her outburst, maybe she was dangerous. Or maybe, I&rsquo;m just imagining things. But as she collapsed into Steve&rsquo;s arms, I was actually worried for her. It was a lot to take in. I ignored the protests from the disapproving Clint Barton, he just couldn&rsquo;t understand. He should understand.&nbsp;</p><p>She needed protection.&nbsp;</p><p>A safe haven.&nbsp;</p><p>Because once her vulnerable state gets manipulated by the wrong hands, then that&rsquo;s when we should start getting worried about her being dangerous. Because there&rsquo;s no going back from there.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>CLINT BARTON P.O.V</b></h2><p>All eyes on Capt. when he returns from sending an unconscious Y/N Strange into her room. Am I the only one thinking that this could backfire on us? Should I have felt bad when the sob story came pouring out from Strange&rsquo;s mouth? No, she was a danger but no one could understand that.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to discuss this.&rdquo; I announced, grabbing the attention from everyone. Nat just shakes her head. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to discuss, Clint?&rdquo; Nat asked, her brows furrowing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That she&rsquo;s a danger to everyone here! It isn&rsquo;t safe, not for us or the world!&rdquo; I said as I slammed my fist down onto the table.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve begins his approach and I shook my head, already knowing what their choice was. &ldquo;We protect our own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our own!?&rdquo; I scoffed in disbelief and irritation, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not one of us, tell them Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Strange&rsquo;s family, Barton&hellip;&rdquo; Tony trailed off, bringing his hand up to rub the back of his neck awkwardly, &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s helped us through a lot, we have to help them.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Maybe we think this through, yes?&rdquo; Wanda spoke slowly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, that it&rsquo;s going to be dangerous, or that she&rsquo;s dangerous but we&rsquo;ve faced worst&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Her brother instantly agreed with her as he nodded, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s clearly scared and her life was just turned upside down, have a little compassion old man.&rdquo;</p><p>I just stare at them, obviously this was a battle I was going to lose. I shook my head, they had their valid points but they weren&rsquo;t thinking about safety. Not a single plan being discussed, not wanting to press the buttons of a girl that got her whole life turned upside down. Giving them one last look and a shake of my head, I stalked out of the room&ndash; wanting to cool myself down before I say anything I might regret.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>LOKI LAUFEYSON P.O.V</b></h2><p>From the moment she barged in, I was captivated&ndash; intrigued. As anger consumed her, you can feel the energy radiating off of her. She <i>is </i>clearly capable of being powerful. As I watched her angered self unfold before me, it was obvious that she had not unlocked her inner Kree yet. The power she had by throwing her brother across the room was remarkable and with enough practice and knowledge of the matter, she would be able to beat even Thor himself.&nbsp;</p><p>I listened disapprovingly at Clint Barton&rsquo;s protests, of course he would think she was a danger to them. Of course, the hell she is! She can be a strong warrior, that I know for sure. He was scared&ndash; probably because I&rsquo;ve given him a reason to be wary of such new comers that have certain abilities. He was right about Y/N being dangerous. Like I said, she is powerful&ndash; but right now she was in a vulnerable state with her life being turned upside down. They were clearly in danger if the Kree were after her, we could be running out of time already but pushing Y/N would be the wrong move. She could pull back and everything would be ruined.&nbsp;</p><p>I need to discuss this with my brother, as it is obvious that none of the members of the team would bother listening to me. Though, with my knowledge of the Kree race&ndash; I would be able to try and reach out to Y/N more than the others.&nbsp;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but watch as she gets carried away by the Captain himself&ndash; I would have offered but clearly that wasn&rsquo;t an option. The team was still clearly wary of my presence. I must find a way though.&nbsp;</p><p>There was something about her that made me frustrated, I have never really cared for someone. Much less a Midgardian or a Kree. Maybe, I&rsquo;m getting myself pulled because of her situation&ndash; something similar to mine. <i>No, don&rsquo;t let it get to your head.&nbsp;</i></p><p>I have to find a way to reach out to Y/N.&nbsp;</p><p>She will need all the help she can get.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>NATASHA ROMANOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>I felt my heart break at the scene before me. I had wanted to check on Y/N as everyone took off to either calm down or find some other thing to do. Clearly the events that took place today have been draining, for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>I watched as Y/N cries into the arms of Stephen, her whole body going limp as she clung onto her brother.&nbsp;</p><p>Not wanting to intrude in a personal matter, I stalked away&ndash; making sure to leave as quietly as I could to not make my presence known. My thoughts go back to everything that had happened, my heart reaching out for Y/N. <i>Poor girl. </i>I wish Clint would understand, this was obviously difficult for Stephen.</p><p>My feet took me off towards the direction of Barton&rsquo;s quarters and I didn&rsquo;t even bother to knock for permission, I just barged myself in. There he sat, on the edge of his bed&ndash; clearly tense, but my entrance barely made him flinch.</p><p>&ldquo;You really need to get your emotions in check, Clint.&rdquo; I scolded him as I close the door behind me, not wanting anyone to intrude in our conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Clint lifted his shoulders up in a shrug as he looks up at me; eyes mixed with fear and regret, he probably felt guilty of the way he handled things but was conflicted. &ldquo;What do you want, Nat?\"&nbsp;</p><p>Walking across the room and settling myself on the edge of the bed beside him, I place a hand on his back, \"I want you to understand the situation without getting mad. I understand what you mean, that it&rsquo;s dangerous but your words towards Stephen and his sister were as if you were pouring salt on open fresh wounds.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t even look at me anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>I sighed. &ldquo;I understand that you&rsquo;re conflicted, and don&rsquo;t bother denying it. I know you too well&hellip;&rdquo; I trailed off, the corners of my mouth tugging to to a small smile, &ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is calm yourself down first, think things through because those two need our help and they won&rsquo;t be able to get it elsewhere. The team is a family, Strange has been a part of us for awhile now. We can&rsquo;t let him down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered underneath his breath.</p><h2><b>PIETRO MAXIMOFF P.O.V</b></h2><p>Honestly what was all the commotion about? Who were they even talking about? Last I remembered, the rest of the team had been talking about a mission to stop Hydra while Wanda and I excused ourselves to the training room, and now they&rsquo;re suddenly huddled around talking about a sister and some Kree empire. It was all difficult to take such information, there were a lot of missing pieces to be filled&ndash; so I stood quietly at the side but the talk on Kree had interested me just a tiny bit, I suppose.&nbsp;</p><p>Then <i>she</i> appeared, her face filled with anger. She was hurt. She had heard everything. This was bad. I run towards Wanda as she was closest to Doctor Strange after I had realized that the Y/N girl they had been talking about was lunging towards their direction. Instantly, I wrapped Wanda&rsquo;s waist with an arm and pulled her away to a corner. I watched the scene before me unfold, she was devastated. You can clearly see it in her face. I just knew I had to do something.</p><p>Rushing towards the supplies, I grabbed the sedative that I have become so familiar of lately because of missions. I quickly returned just in time to witness her throw Doctor Strange across the room without much effort coming out from her. My eyes widen from the this but I shrugged it off as I got myself near her&ndash; injecting the sedative. Captain America was instantly by my side as she collapsed. <i>Of course he would.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;</i>Quick thinking, Speedy.&rdquo; Tony said as he approached me, patting my back. I give him a nod, my eyes locked on the unconscious Y/N.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve hoists her up into his arms, holding her close against his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her to her room.&rdquo; he announced and I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to tear my attention away until she was out of sight.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>STEVE ROGERS P.O.V</b></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve always had the urge to protect the people. More so often the ones that I truly care about. Always keeping them close to keep an eye on them. I&rsquo;m usually often cautious of the ones I don&rsquo;t know anything of. She was a complete mystery to me but yet&ndash; there was this pull that made me want to protect her from the Kree that wanted to take her and even from Clint.&nbsp;</p><p>Was I attracted to her? I don&rsquo;t know. Y/N is certainly beautiful. The moment she had entered the room before this whole mess started that has caused the team to go tense&ndash; I would have to admit, she did captivate me. It took me a few more seconds to regain my senses and stand my ground in case she was someone we were going to fight. An intruder or some sort. Though, I doubted that. I can&rsquo;t quite understand it yet, but there was something about her that clicked&ndash; made me trust her instantly.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though she was consumed by her anger from the &lsquo;betrayal&rsquo; of her brother, I wasn&rsquo;t worried she might hurt anyone&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t think she was capable to do so. I was more worried she would hurt herself. So as I carried her close to my chest, I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at her facial features. She was calm when she slept. Innocence sweeping across her features. I couldn&rsquo;t stop staring&ndash; I barely knew her yet, she already had me wrapped around her finger. In a romantic way or a brotherly way? I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not sure just yet.&nbsp;</p><p>So as I lay her down on her bed, I let out a sigh before brushing the hair off of her face. &ldquo;Stay strong, kid.&rdquo; I whispered softly before leaving the room and closing the door behind me, making my way back to the team.&nbsp;</p><p>All I know is, there was a good chance that I&rsquo;ll be one of the few that will be protecting her.</p><h2><b>STEPHEN STRANGE P.O.V</b></h2><p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s help you up.&rdquo; Tony said as he approached me from the corner where Y/N had tossed me aside. I was in shock, barely able to make myself move from my position until Tony grips onto my arm and helps me up.</p><p>Guilt.&nbsp;</p><p>That was what I was feeling. Pure guilt.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for it, Strange. You did what you had to do.&rdquo; he said, obviously my face said it all. I shook my head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have kept this from her, then we wouldn&rsquo;t be having this problem. How could I have been so stupid?&rdquo;</p><p>I plopped myself down onto one of the couches and let out a sigh of irritation, and exhaustion. I didn&rsquo;t even care that my back was hurting from the impact of Y/N tossing me aside. I deserved it. I betrayed her. This wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if I would have just told her like the masters who trained her insisted.&nbsp;</p><p>But, no. I was against that from the very beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>What good would it have done? Telling a young girl that her parents were murdered and that she wasn&rsquo;t really my sister? That would have broken her.</p><p><i>No, she would have handled it. She&rsquo;s stronger than you think. </i>I&rsquo;m a fool. She probably hates me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have known, Strange.&rdquo; Tony said one last time before leaving the room with my thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>I sighed and leaned back against the couch. I had a lot of thinking to do before approaching her.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>THOR ODINSON</b></h2><p>Today was just a whole bunch of entertainment. As soon as everyone dispersed, Loki and I had decided to walk alongside towards our chambers&ndash; or is it bedroom the Midgardians call it?</p><p>As we walked, I couldn&rsquo;t help but glance over my brother with a raised eyebrow. He was obviously deep in thought, &ldquo;What has gotten you so silent, brother?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, &ldquo; The girl&ndash; she is clearly powerful than Strange had anticipated.&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded my head in response. The Strange girl&ndash; <i>huh, I suppose that&rsquo;s one catchy way of calling her, </i>obviously possessed such great power within her but it has yet to be shown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that none of the others will be able to be much help for the Strange girl. She&ndash; she is in dire need of assistance if she were to survive what is to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who do you have in mind, brother? Certainly, you are not contemplating on bringing her to Asgard. She will receive no help there.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Once again, Loki was right. Asgardians&ndash; as much as they had knowledge of the Kree race, they were not going to be much help. \"I will seek help elsewhere&ndash; find connections, if I must.&rdquo;</p><p>He halted behind me, I spun around and raised a brow at his actions. &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re not suggesting of leaving me here with these people? I&rsquo;m positive they wouldn&rsquo;t even allow it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will speak to them but for now&ndash; you are the one who has more knowledge of the matter. You are the only one capable of addressing the girl with her situation. Try your best to stay out of trouble, brother. I will return shortly.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>TONY STARK</b></h2><p>Leaving the tension filled room was exactly what I needed. Everyone was on edge now&ndash; hoping to find answers as quick as possible just to ease the stress. I shook my head, I could feel it already&ndash; we&rsquo;ll be going on a rollercoaster ride for the next couple of months. Hopefully not.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally in the comforts of my lab, I couldn&rsquo;t help but get my thoughts pulled back to the events from earlier&ndash; it was obviously distracting me that tinkering with new gadgets wasn&rsquo;t helping. Everyone was obviously taken back, not to mention Clint had blown his top off. We were the Avengers, obviously who wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a break soon. Breaks around here were impossible, a miracle most of the time if it happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N is obviously a danger, that much I agree with Clint but at the moment, she wasn&rsquo;t a threat. Her emotions were just sending her off, and Clint wasn&rsquo;t helping with his comments. It was best that everyone would ease her in, let her know that we were there for her when she needed.&nbsp;</p><p>She is clearly powerful.&nbsp;</p><p>Going back, I remember the conversation I had with Stephen just before this happened.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;You have to help me, Stark.&rdquo; he pleaded desperately. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re after her and I won&rsquo;t be able to protect her on my own. You and the team are the only ones I can think of to trust.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Thor&rsquo;s voice boomed across the room, snapping me from my thoughts. I looked over at his direction, my brows raising at his stance&ndash; his brother nowhere to be found.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you suppose to be taking care of your brother?&rdquo; I reminded him with a sly grin.&nbsp;</p><p>He chuckled as he approached me. <i>Oh boy.</i>&nbsp;I already have a bad feeling about this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I will be leaving my brother in your custody as I search help on the matter at hand. The Strange girl clearly needs all the help she could get, and I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be much. Loki has knowledge on the matter, allow him to approach the girl with the doctor&rsquo;s blessing. He can help. I know you aren&rsquo;t fond of the idea of Loki changing, but give it time. I believe he&rsquo;s truly changing for the better.&rdquo;</p><p>I sat there, completely dumbfounded at his words before shaking my head. Thor does, what Thor wants. There was obviously nothing stopping him. &ldquo;Fine, but I&rsquo;m calling in Banner just in case. He&rsquo;ll be the one keeping an eye on Loki. Not me.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>WANDA MAXIMOFF</b></h2><p>The only ones left were now me, Pietro and Vision. We sat there quietly, staring at absolutely nothing. The events that we had just witness had obviously put us all into shock. Not that we haven&rsquo;t been through worst things&ndash; but obviously it&rsquo;s still taking some time to get used to.&nbsp;</p><p>I looked over my brother, trying my best to read his thoughts. He clearly had a soft spot for the girl&ndash; I can sense his care. &ldquo;You want to help her?&rdquo; He nodded in response, not even bothering to say a word to me. &ldquo;You stay away from her until we know more, she is clearly dangerous.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s up to you, sister.&rdquo; he muttered underneath his breath before disappearing from my sight. I rolled my eyes&ndash; this was going to be bad news already.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that you don&rsquo;t trust the girl, Wanda.&rdquo; Vision said interrupting my thoughts, &ldquo;but showing it to the girl will only cause more danger.&rdquo;</p><p>I stared at him for a second before shaking my head. Standing from where I was seated, I leave Vision to himself&ndash; walking towards the direction of my room.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t want to trust the girl, but we know nothing yet of her and she was clearly a danger, even to herself. My priority, will always be Pietro. And I&rsquo;ll be damned if he lets his feelings for a girl he barely knows get in the way.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>VISION</b></h2><p>I watched Wanda leave in confusion. She was stubborn. I for one, am also wary of the girl that suddenly appeared in our lives.&nbsp;</p><p>She had danger written all over her&ndash; but negative comments during a vulnerable state will only cause more danger. I had come to realize that everyone mostly kept to themselves for the time being, keeping their thoughts about the girl a secret until we find more answers. That is, except Barton who was very vocal about the situation at hand. I on the other hand, agree with Barton but being vocal about it wouldn&rsquo;t help. Most of the team wanted to wait and let the girl get settled in.</p><p>But, I&rsquo;m afraid&ndash; waiting wasn&rsquo;t an option. If the Kree had broken through the doctor&rsquo;s hidden manor, then clearly the tower wasn&rsquo;t safe. For anyone. I must approach Stark about this immediately. For all we know, the Kree are just waiting for the right time to attack. The tower was no place to hide the girl.&nbsp;</p><p>The girl.</p><p>Such innocence. So vulnerable.&nbsp;</p><p>Her whole world turned upside down less than a day. No one else to trust but her brother. I will keep my distance, but keep an eye on her in case something goes wrong.&nbsp;Even we were no match for her in case her powers grow stronger each passing day.</p><p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be waiting.&nbsp;</p><p>I can already sense the danger approaching.</p><hr /><p><b>TTTAGGED: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_3melGmsW9rPiRnApzszcA\">@alessia&ndash;winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpj0O9f5F11r6rnLdRoKWOA\">@totobyafricaa</a></b></p></p>",
