He was proving his worth to you more and more each second of every minute of every hour of everyday. Your trust in him was building slowly but surely again, just like when you had just started dating back in high school.</p><p>You didn\u2019t expect him to ever do anything grand, it was always the little things that count. </p><p>As hard headed as Bakugou was, he had a soft side underneath all those tough layers. He would leave little surprises for you when you least expected it like, sending anonymous flowers to your agency that greeted you at your desk when you arrived to work for the day, attached with a little note, \u2018I never forgot your favorite flower\u2019</p><p>Or when he comes to your apartment unannounced to cook dinner for you or just to spend quality time with you. He would lay with you, tracing small patterns in your back as you drifted to sleep after a hard day of work. He would press soft kisses to your knuckles, a very small gesture but all the more heartfelt. It was the small things. </p><p>You also kept in touch with Prince Zachary, updating him on the latest news about you and Bakugou. He was absolutely ecstatic about your reborn relationship with the blonde.</p><p><i>\u201cI knew it! I totally knew it (y/n)-chan!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You giggled \u201cwell, we\u2019re just taking it slow right now. He still has to build his trust back\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course! That\u2019s the number one thing that builds a relationship and a man!\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cAmen to that\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI wish I could talk to you more but I have to go very soon (y/n)-chan, I miss you!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI miss you too Zachary-sama please come visit again soon\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will! And be sure to let me know when the wedding will be!\u201d the prince teased and you explode in a blush on the other end of the line. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWedding!?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBye (y/n)-chan!\u201d</i></p><p>~Time Skip 5 years later~</p><p>You stared at yourself in the mirror. </p><p>Your face dolled up in a simple makeup, enhancing your natural beauty. Your hair was neatly done in a half up-do and your veil hung around your head masking your head. </p><p>You sat at your vanity as the stylists double checking for anything missing making sure that everything was perfect and secure.</p><p>This was it. This was your big wedding day. You were getting married to the love of your life.</p><p>As the ceremony started, Bakugou stood at the altar, anxiously waiting for your arrival. The audience stood, filled with all your closests friends, family and classmates, as music started playing and the doors opened. Watching as the flower girl, Kaminari and Jirou\u2019s daughter, and ring bearer, Deku and Ochako\u2019s son, made their way first up the aisle. The young boy going up to Bakugou giving him a playful fist bump and handing him the ring. Kirishima stood by Bakugou as his best man grinning ear to ear. Finally came to you.</p><p>You stepped through the door, arm linked with your high school teacher, Aizawa, who was like a father figure to you. You had asked him to walk in place of your late father, and he happily obliged. </p><p>Bakugou was completely mesmerized by you. You were absolutely beautiful to him, he was breathless. It was like in that moment he fell in love with you all over again, as if he had gone back to his high school days and first felt those fluttering butterflies in his stomach every time he caught sight of you.

And be sure to let me know when the wedding will be!&rdquo; the prince teased and you explode in a blush on the other end of the line. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wedding!?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Bye (y/n)-chan!&rdquo;</i></p><p>~Time Skip 5 years later~</p><p>You stared at yourself in the mirror. </p><p>Your face dolled up in a simple makeup, enhancing your natural beauty. Your hair was neatly done in a half up-do and your veil hung around your head masking your head. </p><p>You sat at your vanity as the stylists double checking for anything missing making sure that everything was perfect and secure.</p><p>This was it. This was your big wedding day. You were getting married to the love of your life.</p><p>As the ceremony started, Bakugou stood at the altar, anxiously waiting for your arrival. The audience stood, filled with all your closests friends, family and classmates, as music started playing and the doors opened. Watching as the flower girl, Kaminari and Jirou&rsquo;s daughter, and ring bearer, Deku and Ochako&rsquo;s son, made their way first up the aisle. The young boy going up to Bakugou giving him a playful fist bump and handing him the ring. Kirishima stood by Bakugou as his best man grinning ear to ear. Finally came to you.</p><p>You stepped through the door, arm linked with your high school teacher, Aizawa, who was like a father figure to you. You had asked him to walk in place of your late father, and he happily obliged. </p><p>Bakugou was completely mesmerized by you. You were absolutely beautiful to him, he was breathless. It was like in that moment he fell in love with you all over again, as if he had gone back to his high school days and first felt those fluttering butterflies in his stomach every time he caught sight of you. He gave you one of those rare genuine smiles only you could create. </p><p>The ceremony went on, once you finished your vows and the priest said those last few words: &ldquo;you may kiss the bride&rdquo;, you practically jumped on Bakugou, molding your lips in a passionate kiss. </p><p>The crowd cheered and rejoiced as the new couple made their way out of the church. Bakugou carrying you bridal style and twirling you around. </p><p>&ldquo;(y/n)-chan!&rdquo; a cheery voice called.</p><p>Looking over Bakugou&rsquo;s shoulder you see your favorite friendly prince. </p><p>&ldquo;Prince Zachary you made it!&rdquo; you exclaimed, patting you new husband&rsquo;s shoulder, motioning behind him, &ldquo;Look it&rsquo;s Prince Zachary he&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I couldn&rsquo;t miss my sweet (y/n)-chan&rsquo;s wedding! I predicted this ya know!&rdquo; he laughs, &ldquo;Well thank you for coming it&rsquo;s so nice to see you again, Zachary-san. Honestly this wouldn&rsquo;t happen if it weren&rsquo;t for you, really thank you&rdquo; you bow.</p><p>&ldquo;No no no&rdquo; he waves his hands in front of him defensively. &ldquo;No need to thank me, this was all loves doing! This all happened because of your love (y/n)-chan!&rdquo; you smile at him, &ldquo;but really thank you Zachary-san&rdquo; he takes your hands in his, giving you another bright smile. &ldquo;Everyone deserves to be happy, and I hope you&rsquo;re granted eternal happiness (y/n)-chan&rdquo; </p><p>You look to your husband who hadn&rsquo;t moved from his spot next to you, giving him a soft smile. &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s already come true&rdquo; Bakugou smiles back at you, placing an arm around your waist. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful&rdquo; he looks at you with a soft gaze, his hard exterior shut down for the occasion. </p><p>&ldquo;BAKUGOUUUUU!!!!&rdquo; Kirishima screaming, running towards you two with tears streaming down his face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it! You&rsquo;re married man! And to (y/n)! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU!!!&rdquo; he messily cries, snot starting to run out of his nose. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell shitty hair! Quit cryin&rsquo; you got boogers running down your face!&rdquo; the blonde male snaps pushing his face away from him as you laugh at the two men. Everyone approaches you and Bakugou congratulating you on your marriage. The rest of the day is spent sharing laughs and partying hard and dancing to your hearts content. </p><p>That night, you two slump down on the plush bed in the 5-star hotel Bakugou had reserved for your special night. You turn to face your husband, taking in all his handsome features. From his broad shoulders, to the outline of his toned muscles through his shirt, the smooth skin of his face, the fiery crimson red of his irises, all the way to the tips of his spikey blonde hair. Everything about him was just perfect. And he was all yours. </p><p>Bakugou shifted his position on the bed, propping himself on one arm and laying on his side. He studied your face, revelling in your beauty for the umpteenth time today. He couldn&rsquo;t believe he was finally married to the love of his life. The woman he fought for for so long. The woman he worked so hard to gain her trust back. And all the fight was worth it. </p><p>&ldquo;Today was amazing&hellip; I&rsquo;m so tired&hellip;&rdquo; you whisper, your eyes starting to lull close as sleep was taking over your form. </p><p>But you were brought back awake when a large hand rubs at the exposed skin of your back. You open your eyes to be met with the ash blonde males, red stare. Oh this day wasn&rsquo;t over just yet.</p><p>&ldquo;You think were done? Well this night is gonna be more amazing Princess~&rdquo; a smirk growing on his handsome features. You giggle at his words, &ldquo;Take care of me my dear husband~&rdquo; you coo.</p><p>And he surely kept his word, as you two made love for long hours, basking in each others hot embrace as the night lulled away. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>It was to no surprise when you held a positive pregnancy test a few weeks later. </p>",
