Crowley has no one else. but Aziraphale&rsquo;s learned to tell the difference between what is true on the surface and what is true beneath it all. they&rsquo;ve become something, them two. something intertwined and in sync. Aziraphale has become all Crowley is not willing to lose. and Crowley is all Aziraphale has, too.</p><p>but Crowley is human. and Aziraphale is an android. years go by. plants grow. stories, both made up and real, take on twists and turns. red hair turns grey. wrinkles form around eyes. hands that had let all the plants on Eden&rsquo;s upper decks grow turn gnarled and feeble.

not fair to make me do it blind</i></li><li><i>i dunno,</i>&nbsp;crowley says.<i>&nbsp;</i>they keep going. aziraphale-in-the-puzzle is smiling at whoever he is looking at. the green shiny leaves begin to shiver and part, revealing huge pink hibiscus and tiny white jasmine and orange and yellow lilies.</li><li>the second person is coming into form, slowly, shyly. the leaves have to part to let him through.&nbsp;</li><li><i>it&rsquo;s the last piece,</i>&nbsp;aziraphale finally says, looking at the last piece. it is supposed to be the second person&rsquo;s face. it is instead a piece with nothing but green shiny leaves on it. aziraphale-in-the-puzzle is looking at whoever it is adoringly.</li><li><i>angel</i>, crowley says suddenly, <i>i think we ought to be sober for it.</i></li><li><i>it&rsquo;s not gabriel, is it?
