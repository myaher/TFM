Every few steps she almost tripped over her own feet. All her muscles were aching and she felt sharp stitches in her side, but she kept on running.

And the further away she was when he would discover that his wife was missing, the bigger the chance that she was gonna survive this.</p><p>She had no idea where she was going exactly.

He had really thought he could leave her alone, without guards watching her every step, without his dogs sitting in front of her door with orders to harm her when needed. </p><p>And she had gathered a small basket, some food and water and some clothes and had started running. Because no matter how this story would end, there was no way it could get any worse than her life with Ramsay had been.</p><p>A shiver rolled down her spine when she heard the barking of dogs coming from the woods behind her. She had no idea how much time had passed since she had left, but she didn\u2019t doubt whose dogs were chasing her. Quickly she used her scarf to tie her basket on her back and then she climbed in the nearest tree.</p><p>She had barely reached a branch out of reach when she saw the dogs rushing towards her hiding place. Saliva dripped from their beaks and their sharp teeth glimmered in the evening sun. They pressed their paws against the trunk and barked louder and louder. </p><!-- more --><p>Sansa closed her eyes and she tried to hide herself in between the leaves. But the dogs weren\u2019t stupid. They knew she was here. They recognised her smell. They probably also sensed her fear and the food tied to her back. It was only a matter of time before Ramsay Bolton would be here too. She didn\u2019t dare to think about what he would do.</p><p>Would he simply drag her back to his castle? Would he act like nothing had happened? Would he play the caring and loving husband in front of everyone else, while coming up with new ways to assault her once there was no-one there anymore to see that he was actually a sadistic monster? Or would he order his dogs to eat her alive, to rip the flesh from her bones and to leave her remains to rot away?</p><p>\u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new, if you exist and even care the least bit about me, please\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cPlease, find a way to save me from whatever faith Ramsay Bolton has in mind for me.\u201d</p><p>A loud and deafening howl of a wolf echoed through the forest and quickly Sansa opened her eyes again. A few trees away from the one she was hiding in appeared a large shadow. The white wolf was at least three times as big as the dogs and his fiery red eyes stared at the little puppies while he kept on howling.</p><p>One by one the dogs went silent and motionless. Some of them whined barely hearable while they laid flat on the muddy ground, others ran away before the white wolf could come any nearer. The ones who had decided to run were the lucky ones. The sharp white teeth of the wolf snapped the thin necks of the remaining dogs as if they were nothing but little twigs. </p><p>Within less than a few seconds there was nothing but absolute silence and yet Sansa didn\u2019t dare to move. What if the wolf had only saved her because he wanted her for himself? What if he had simply chased away the dogs because he himself was hungry? What if the danger was far from gone now? What if it had only gotten worse? Much worse?</p><p>Once more Sansa closed her eyes and once more she prayed. \u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new. Please, help me get out of this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Sansa\u2019s eyes flashed open again and right under the tree in which she was hiding now stood a handsome young man with dark black curls tied into a bun on the back of his head. He was wearing nothing but a pair of ripped pants and his naked skin was covered in sweat and gleaming. His dark eyes were looking up at her and slowly he stretched out his hand. \u201cDo you want a hand to come down?\u201d</p><p>Sansa stopped breathing. She had her eyes wide open and yet she couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened. \u201cWhere&rsquo;s the white wolf?\u201d She whispered. Her throat was dry and her entire body started trembling. \u201cDid you kill it? Did it run away?\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI swear, there was a white wolf here. He chased the dogs away and\u2026\u201d </p><p>A small smile appeared on the stranger\u2019s face. He had a deep frown on his forehead and yet there was something about him that made her feel safe and at ease. \u201cThe big bad wolf is gone for now.\u201d He stretched out his hand even further, but she was still out of reach. \u201cI promise he won\u2019t hurt you. I won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Sansa still didn\u2019t move. Instead she wrapped her arms around her trembling body to make sure she wouldn\u2019t lose her balance and fall down. \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d</p><p>The stranger dropped his arm and the smile on his face faltered. \u201cI can\u2019t blame you for not trusting me, lady Sansa.\u201d He paused and it took her a few moments to realise he had used her name. \u201cI&rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to get you out of his claws ever since I saw you at the ball, three months ago.\u201d </p><p>Sansa blinked a few times. She could barely remember the ball, let alone the people who had attended. But she had never gotten the impression before that anyone knew that she longed to be saved and rescued. \u201cHow did you know I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour smile might have fooled most people, but not me.\u201d The stranger let out a deep sigh. \u201cYou looked pretty, but it was as if I was looking at a puppet.\u201d He clenched his jaws. \u201cAnd I knew right away who was pulling the strings.\u201d He locked his glance with hers. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cI almost got away from him. If that wolf hadn\u2019t appeared\u2026\u201d She shivered once more. \u201cIt seems that in the end he was the one to find a way to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved yourself, princess.\u201d The stranger smiled at her again. \u201cBecause you had courage and faith. You ran away, very well knowing what the risks were. You shouldn\u2019t give me all the credits. You should give most of them to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips and then slowly her mind started to make sense of what had happened. And even though she should be terrified. And even though she should only distrust him more, she couldn\u2019t help but smiling back at him. \u201cI still want to thank you.\u201d She climbed down again until she was within reach of his strong arms to help her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d He bowed and bent his head. \u201cAnd the pleasure is all mine, princess.\u201d He looked up again and now she saw the hint of red in his eyes, hidden behind their natural darkness. \u201cWhere will you go now?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWhere we will go now?\u201d She reached for his hand and pulled him closer towards her. \u201cI might have found the courage and faith to run away, but I could use someone like you looking out for me anyway. You never know if and when the dogs might come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my honour, princess.\u201d Jon bowed once more. \u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Anywhere. Everywhere. Somewhere safe.\u201d </p>",

She didn\u2019t dare to think about what he would do.</p><p>Would he simply drag her back to his castle? Would he act like nothing had happened? Would he play the caring and loving husband in front of everyone else, while coming up with new ways to assault her once there was no-one there anymore to see that he was actually a sadistic monster? Or would he order his dogs to eat her alive, to rip the flesh from her bones and to leave her remains to rot away?</p><p>\u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new, if you exist and even care the least bit about me, please\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered. \u201cPlease, find a way to save me from whatever faith Ramsay Bolton has in mind for me.\u201d</p><p>A loud and deafening howl of a wolf echoed through the forest and quickly Sansa opened her eyes again. A few trees away from the one she was hiding in appeared a large shadow. The white wolf was at least three times as big as the dogs and his fiery red eyes stared at the little puppies while he kept on howling.</p><p>One by one the dogs went silent and motionless. Some of them whined barely hearable while they laid flat on the muddy ground, others ran away before the white wolf could come any nearer. The ones who had decided to run were the lucky ones. The sharp white teeth of the wolf snapped the thin necks of the remaining dogs as if they were nothing but little twigs. </p><p>Within less than a few seconds there was nothing but absolute silence and yet Sansa didn\u2019t dare to move. What if the wolf had only saved her because he wanted her for himself? What if he had simply chased away the dogs because he himself was hungry? What if the danger was far from gone now? What if it had only gotten worse? Much worse?</p><p>Once more Sansa closed her eyes and once more she prayed. \u201cDear Gods, both the old and the new. Please, help me get out of this\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d Sansa\u2019s eyes flashed open again and right under the tree in which she was hiding now stood a handsome young man with dark black curls tied into a bun on the back of his head. He was wearing nothing but a pair of ripped pants and his naked skin was covered in sweat and gleaming. His dark eyes were looking up at her and slowly he stretched out his hand. \u201cDo you want a hand to come down?\u201d</p><p>Sansa stopped breathing. She had her eyes wide open and yet she couldn\u2019t make sense of what had happened. \u201cWhere\u2019s the white wolf?\u201d She whispered. Her throat was dry and her entire body started trembling. \u201cDid you kill it? Did it run away?\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI swear, there was a white wolf here. He chased the dogs away and\u2026\u201d </p><p>A small smile appeared on the stranger\u2019s face. He had a deep frown on his forehead and yet there was something about him that made her feel safe and at ease. \u201cThe big bad wolf is gone for now.\u201d He stretched out his hand even further, but she was still out of reach. \u201cI promise he won\u2019t hurt you. I won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Sansa still didn\u2019t move. Instead she wrapped her arms around her trembling body to make sure she wouldn\u2019t lose her balance and fall down. \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d</p><p>The stranger dropped his arm and the smile on his face faltered. \u201cI can\u2019t blame you for not trusting me, lady Sansa.\u201d He paused and it took her a few moments to realise he had used her name. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find a way to get you out of his claws ever since I saw you at the ball, three months ago.\u201d </p><p>Sansa blinked a few times. She could barely remember the ball, let alone the people who had attended. But she had never gotten the impression before that anyone knew that she longed to be saved and rescued. \u201cHow did you know I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour smile might have fooled most people, but not me.\u201d The stranger let out a deep sigh. \u201cYou looked pretty, but it was as if I was looking at a puppet.\u201d He clenched his jaws. \u201cAnd I knew right away who was pulling the strings.\u201d He locked his glance with hers. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cI almost got away from him. If that wolf hadn\u2019t appeared\u2026\u201d She shivered once more. \u201cIt seems that in the end he was the one to find a way to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved yourself, princess.\u201d The stranger smiled at her again. \u201cBecause you had courage and faith. You ran away, very well knowing what the risks were. You shouldn\u2019t give me all the credits. You should give most of them to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Sansa licked her dry lips and then slowly her mind started to make sense of what had happened. And even though she should be terrified. And even though she should only distrust him more, she couldn\u2019t help but smiling back at him. \u201cI still want to thank you.\u201d She climbed down again until she was within reach of his strong arms to help her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cJon, Jon Snow.\u201d He bowed and bent his head. \u201cAnd the pleasure is all mine, princess.\u201d He looked up again and now she saw the hint of red in his eyes, hidden behind their natural darkness. \u201cWhere will you go now?\u201d</p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWhere we will go now?\u201d She reached for his hand and pulled him closer towards her. \u201cI might have found the courage and faith to run away, but I could use someone like you looking out for me anyway. You never know if and when the dogs might come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my honour, princess.\u201d Jon bowed once more. \u201cWhere will we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere. Everywhere. Somewhere safe.\u201d </p>",

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

But despite its simplicity, there\u2019s a lot going on in this chapter. Jon I introduced the first really big conflict in the Stark family (Jon vs Catelyn), and Arya I introduces the second (Sansa vs Arya). It also our first real introduction to Sansa; not just her as a person, but a character in her element and the social sphere she\u2019s most comfortable in. </p><p>Martin has said before that he originally created Sansa as a contrast for Arya and to introduce some conflict into the Stark family, and that\u2019s very much in evidence in these first few chapters, starting with how in the second paragraph of her very first POV chapter Arya is already being contrasted unfavorably with Sansa by Septa Mordane.</p><blockquote><p><i>Arya\u2019s stitches were crooked again.</i></p><p><i>She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa\u2019s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \u201cSansa\u2019s work is as pretty as she is,\u201d Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. \u201cShe has such fine, delicate hands.\u201d When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \u201cArya has the hands of a blacksmith.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a perception in fandom that Sansa and Arya fundamentally don\u2019t like each other or that Sansa was condescending to Arya, but something that\u2019s underrated is just how much the two are actively pitted against each other by Septa Mordane. And this is as good a time as any to mention that Septa Mordane fails epically in her role as a mentor and is kind of a dick. It\u2019s one thing for Septa Mordane to not want to encourage Arya\u2019s more rambunctious interests, but it\u2019s entirely another for her to constantly beat Arya down and reinforce her negative self image.</p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate in a lot of ways that Arya\u2019s POV comes before Sansa\u2019s. It\u2019s a known psychological phenomenon that your first impression of someone else really does affect how you see them: there\u2019s a study (wish I still had the link) where two groups were given the same list of actions someone took with the only difference being a negative or positive news story they had the group read about the person before the list of actions. Sure enough, people who read the negative news story rated that person\u2019s actions as more negative, while the people who read the positive news story rated their actions as more positive.</p><p>With Sansa all her negatives as a character are front loaded, and our perception of her is permanently tarnished by Arya\u2019s frustration and issues with her. This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p><!-- more --><blockquote><p><i>She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\u2019s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they\u2019re talking about it\u2019s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJoffrey likes your sister,\u201d Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell\u2019s steward and Sansa\u2019s dearest friend. \u201cHe told her she was very beautiful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her,\u201d little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \u201cThen Sansa will be queen of all the realm.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \u201cBeth, you shouldn\u2019t make up stories,\u201d Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \u201cWhat did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\u2019s very gallant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She\u2019s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn\u2019t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that\u2019s she engaged in it. I think there\u2019s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there\u2019s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon says he looks like a girl,\u201d Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. \u201cPoor Jon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Sansa isn\u2019t completely off base here. If Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it\u2019s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it\u2019ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it\u2019s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon\u2019s opinion because of his birth, she\u2019s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother,\u201d Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOur half brother,\u201d Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb \u201cStark\u201d). There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be made that\u2019s Sansa\u2019s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That\u2019s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we\u2019ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard\u201d Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn\u2019t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don\u2019t get Sansa POV of this interaction there\u2019s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we\u2019re in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we\u2019ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we\u2019re currently in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \u201cLet me see your stitches.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\u2019s attention. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, surrendering up her work.</i></p><p><i>The septa examined the fabric. \u201cArya, Arya, Arya,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will not do. This will not do at all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\u2019s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the pettier and crueler things Septa Mordane does. Instead of minimizing Arya\u2019s embarrassment, she amplifies it so she can preen and cast herself as long suffering. She truly is the worst.</p><p>There\u2019s also an interesting thing going on here where Arya\u2019s attributing things to Sansa that aren\u2019t actually happening. First she blames Sansa for attracting Mordane\u2019s attention, then thinks thinks Sansa is internally pleased at her embarrassment but just isn\u2019t showing it. In both instances there\u2019s no actual proof this is what&rsquo;s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\u2019s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there\u2019s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne. And while Sansa doesn\u2019t seem to have shut Jeyne down (though I can\u2019t remember if she ever knew Jeyne was doing that), it is worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t bully Arya, and outside of arguments doesn\u2019t seem to antagonize her.</p><p>This matters because Sansa and Jeyne despite being lumped together in Arya\u2019s head, actually occupy very different positions within Winterfell. I wish I had bookmarked it, but I just read a meta the other day about how galling Arya\u2019s existence must\u2019ve been for Jeyne; no matter how much closer she is to Sansa or better at feminine pursuits, Jeyne because of her birth will always be lower than Arya, never Sansa\u2019s true sister. Which is kind of fascinating when you remember that Jeyne will later be forced to be Arya when she\u2019s married to Ramsay. She gets what she wants, but very much not how she wanted it.</p><p>(this also makes me want to read a Jon x Jeyne AU. No? Just me? Fine)</p><blockquote><p><i>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i></p></blockquote><p>Being canonically bad at horse riding and math are strangely enough two things people tend to forget about Sansa. Partly I\u2019m sure it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t in the show, and partly it just doesn\u2019t really jive with the rest of Sansa\u2019s character. Being able to manage a household is part of the westerosi feminine ideal, and so it doesn\u2019t really make sense that she\u2019d be bad at it, especially considering how well she is at logistics and managing a household later on in the Eyrie. Chalking this one up to early installment weirdness seems fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \u201cCome,\u201d she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They [Arya and Nymeria] arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very Jon pose; composed, thoughtful, intent. It\u2019s actually low-key one of my favorite descriptions for just how much it tells you about Jon in just a few words. It\u2019s also very in keeping with how Bran described him in his chapter as slender and quick and graceful. Jon in these early chapters and from the viewpoint of Bran and Arya has a very different physicality to him than later when things are solely from his viewpoint. In these early chapters he\u2019s a little more bishie than later; partly because he\u2019s younger, partly because men don\u2019t think there appearance as much in fiction.</p><p>Which all on its own is interesting to contrast with Tyrion who is exceptionally aware of his body at all times, and the female characters who are much more attentive to what they wear and how they look. I tend to think it comes from Martin\u2019s, however subconscious, male gaze, but it also fits westeros: women from a young age are socialized to view themselves as sex objects and to be hyper aware of their attractiveness and appearance. It\u2019s sadly not that different from the real world.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon gave her a curious look. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya made a face at him. \u201cI wanted to see them fight.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiled. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more exhausting than needlework,\u201d Jon observed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more fun than needlework,\u201d Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\u2019s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s fear that her outsider qualities stem from bastardy hints at just how much damage Catelyn\u2019s ostracization of Jon seeps unintentionally into the rest of the starklings. As we saw when Sansa called Jon a bastard, Arya equates bastardy with otherness. It\u2019s no doubt one of the reasons she\u2019s so close to Jon as they both don\u2019t feel like they fit. That and his unquestioning acceptance of her less feminine coded interests.</p><p>And just like when he gave up having his own wolf so Bran and the other starklings could get theirs, we see again just how much Jon loves his siblings. It must\u2019ve stung for Arya to so blatantly unhappy about being like him, but he wasn\u2019t bitter about it. In general with his siblings Jon doesn\u2019t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down in the yard?\u201d Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. \u201cBastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Lannisters are proud,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cYou\u2019d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\u2019s House equal in honor to the king\u2019s.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe woman is important too!\u201d Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA wolf with a fish in its mouth?\u201d It made her laugh. \u201cThat would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\u2019t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. \u201cGirls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon\u2019s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon\u2019s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he\u2019s challenged with again and again.<br/></p><p>It\u2019s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn\u2019t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn\u2019t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \u201cThe show is done,\u201d he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \u201cYou had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You\u2019ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya didn\u2019t think it was funny. \u201cI hate needlework!\u201d she said with passion. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is fair,\u201d Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it\u2019s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I\u2019m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there\u2019s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren\u2019t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they\u2019re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she\u2019s bad at them and there\u2019s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her \u201cthe woman matters too!\u201d exclamation, which is a far cry from her \u201cmost girls are dumb\u201d line later in the show. It\u2019s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it\u2019s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that\u2019s consistent with her character. We won\u2019t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won\u2019t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran\u2019s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p>",

It\u2019s a known psychological phenomenon that your first impression of someone else really does affect how you see them: there\u2019s a study (wish I still had the link) where two groups were given the same list of actions someone took with the only difference being a negative or positive news story they had the group read about the person before the list of actions.

This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p><i>She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\u2019s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they\u2019re talking about it\u2019s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJoffrey likes your sister,\u201d Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell\u2019s steward and Sansa\u2019s dearest friend. \u201cHe told her she was very beautiful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her,\u201d little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \u201cThen Sansa will be queen of all the realm.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \u201cBeth, you shouldn\u2019t make up stories,\u201d Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \u201cWhat did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\u2019s very gallant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She\u2019s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn\u2019t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that\u2019s she engaged in it. I think there\u2019s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there\u2019s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon says he looks like a girl,\u201d Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. \u201cPoor Jon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Sansa isn\u2019t completely off base here. If Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it\u2019s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it\u2019ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it\u2019s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon\u2019s opinion because of his birth, she\u2019s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother,\u201d Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOur half brother,\u201d Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb \u201cStark\u201d). There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be made that\u2019s Sansa\u2019s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That\u2019s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we\u2019ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard\u201d Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn\u2019t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don\u2019t get Sansa POV of this interaction there\u2019s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we\u2019re in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we\u2019ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we\u2019re currently in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \u201cLet me see your stitches.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\u2019s attention. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, surrendering up her work.</i></p><p><i>The septa examined the fabric. \u201cArya, Arya, Arya,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will not do. This will not do at all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\u2019s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the pettier and crueler things Septa Mordane does. Instead of minimizing Arya\u2019s embarrassment, she amplifies it so she can preen and cast herself as long suffering. She truly is the worst.</p><p>There\u2019s also an interesting thing going on here where Arya\u2019s attributing things to Sansa that aren\u2019t actually happening. First she blames Sansa for attracting Mordane\u2019s attention, then thinks thinks Sansa is internally pleased at her embarrassment but just isn\u2019t showing it. In both instances there\u2019s no actual proof this is what\u2019s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\u2019s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there\u2019s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne. And while Sansa doesn\u2019t seem to have shut Jeyne down (though I can\u2019t remember if she ever knew Jeyne was doing that), it is worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t bully Arya, and outside of arguments doesn\u2019t seem to antagonize her.</p><p>This matters because Sansa and Jeyne despite being lumped together in Arya\u2019s head, actually occupy very different positions within Winterfell. I wish I had bookmarked it, but I just read a meta the other day about how galling Arya\u2019s existence must\u2019ve been for Jeyne; no matter how much closer she is to Sansa or better at feminine pursuits, Jeyne because of her birth will always be lower than Arya, never Sansa\u2019s true sister. Which is kind of fascinating when you remember that Jeyne will later be forced to be Arya when she\u2019s married to Ramsay. She gets what she wants, but very much not how she wanted it.</p><p>(this also makes me want to read a Jon x Jeyne AU. No? Just me? Fine)</p><blockquote><p><i>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i></p></blockquote><p>Being canonically bad at horse riding and math are strangely enough two things people tend to forget about Sansa. Partly I\u2019m sure it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t in the show, and partly it just doesn\u2019t really jive with the rest of Sansa\u2019s character. Being able to manage a household is part of the westerosi feminine ideal, and so it doesn\u2019t really make sense that she\u2019d be bad at it, especially considering how well she is at logistics and managing a household later on in the Eyrie. Chalking this one up to early installment weirdness seems fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \u201cCome,\u201d she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They [Arya and Nymeria] arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very Jon pose; composed, thoughtful, intent. It\u2019s actually low-key one of my favorite descriptions for just how much it tells you about Jon in just a few words. It\u2019s also very in keeping with how Bran described him in his chapter as slender and quick and graceful. Jon in these early chapters and from the viewpoint of Bran and Arya has a very different physicality to him than later when things are solely from his viewpoint. In these early chapters he\u2019s a little more bishie than later; partly because he\u2019s younger, partly because men don\u2019t think there appearance as much in fiction.</p><p>Which all on its own is interesting to contrast with Tyrion who is exceptionally aware of his body at all times, and the female characters who are much more attentive to what they wear and how they look. I tend to think it comes from Martin\u2019s, however subconscious, male gaze, but it also fits westeros: women from a young age are socialized to view themselves as sex objects and to be hyper aware of their attractiveness and appearance. It\u2019s sadly not that different from the real world.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon gave her a curious look. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya made a face at him. \u201cI wanted to see them fight.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiled. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more exhausting than needlework,\u201d Jon observed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more fun than needlework,\u201d Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\u2019s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s fear that her outsider qualities stem from bastardy hints at just how much damage Catelyn\u2019s ostracization of Jon seeps unintentionally into the rest of the starklings. As we saw when Sansa called Jon a bastard, Arya equates bastardy with otherness. It\u2019s no doubt one of the reasons she\u2019s so close to Jon as they both don\u2019t feel like they fit. That and his unquestioning acceptance of her less feminine coded interests.</p><p>And just like when he gave up having his own wolf so Bran and the other starklings could get theirs, we see again just how much Jon loves his siblings. It must\u2019ve stung for Arya to so blatantly unhappy about being like him, but he wasn\u2019t bitter about it. In general with his siblings Jon doesn\u2019t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down in the yard?\u201d Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. \u201cBastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Lannisters are proud,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cYou\u2019d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\u2019s House equal in honor to the king\u2019s.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe woman is important too!\u201d Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA wolf with a fish in its mouth?\u201d It made her laugh. \u201cThat would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\u2019t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. \u201cGirls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon\u2019s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon\u2019s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he\u2019s challenged with again and again.<br></p><p>It\u2019s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn\u2019t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn\u2019t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \u201cThe show is done,\u201d he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \u201cYou had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You\u2019ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya didn\u2019t think it was funny. \u201cI hate needlework!\u201d she said with passion. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is fair,\u201d Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it\u2019s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I\u2019m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there\u2019s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren\u2019t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they\u2019re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she\u2019s bad at them and there\u2019s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her \u201cthe woman matters too!\u201d exclamation, which is a far cry from her \u201cmost girls are dumb\u201d line later in the show. It\u2019s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it\u2019s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that\u2019s consistent with her character. We won\u2019t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won\u2019t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran\u2019s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p></p>",

But despite its simplicity, there\u2019s a lot going on in this chapter. Jon I introduced the first really big conflict in the Stark family (Jon vs Catelyn), and Arya I introduces the second (Sansa vs Arya). It also our first real introduction to Sansa; not just her as a person, but a character in her element and the social sphere she\u2019s most comfortable in. </p><p>Martin has said before that he originally created Sansa as a contrast for Arya and to introduce some conflict into the Stark family, and that\u2019s very much in evidence in these first few chapters, starting with how in the second paragraph of her very first POV chapter Arya is already being contrasted unfavorably with Sansa by Septa Mordane.</p><blockquote><p><i>Arya\u2019s stitches were crooked again.</i></p><p><i>She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa\u2019s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \u201cSansa\u2019s work is as pretty as she is,\u201d Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. \u201cShe has such fine, delicate hands.\u201d When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \u201cArya has the hands of a blacksmith.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a perception in fandom that Sansa and Arya fundamentally don\u2019t like each other or that Sansa was condescending to Arya, but something that\u2019s underrated is just how much the two are actively pitted against each other by Septa Mordane. And this is as good a time as any to mention that Septa Mordane fails epically in her role as a mentor and is kind of a dick. It\u2019s one thing for Septa Mordane to not want to encourage Arya\u2019s more rambunctious interests, but it\u2019s entirely another for her to constantly beat Arya down and reinforce her negative self image.</p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate in a lot of ways that Arya\u2019s POV comes before Sansa\u2019s. It\u2019s a known psychological phenomenon that your first impression of someone else really does affect how you see them: there\u2019s a study (wish I still had the link) where two groups were given the same list of actions someone took with the only difference being a negative or positive news story they had the group read about the person before the list of actions. Sure enough, people who read the negative news story rated that person\u2019s actions as more negative, while the people who read the positive news story rated their actions as more positive.</p><p>With Sansa all her negatives as a character are front loaded, and our perception of her is permanently tarnished by Arya\u2019s frustration and issues with her. This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p><i>She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\u2019s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they\u2019re talking about it\u2019s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJoffrey likes your sister,\u201d Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell\u2019s steward and Sansa\u2019s dearest friend. \u201cHe told her she was very beautiful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her,\u201d little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \u201cThen Sansa will be queen of all the realm.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \u201cBeth, you shouldn\u2019t make up stories,\u201d Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \u201cWhat did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\u2019s very gallant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She\u2019s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn\u2019t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that\u2019s she engaged in it. I think there\u2019s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there\u2019s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon says he looks like a girl,\u201d Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. \u201cPoor Jon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Sansa isn\u2019t completely off base here. If Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it\u2019s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it\u2019ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it\u2019s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon\u2019s opinion because of his birth, she\u2019s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother,\u201d Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOur half brother,\u201d Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb \u201cStark\u201d). There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be made that\u2019s Sansa\u2019s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That\u2019s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we\u2019ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard\u201d Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn\u2019t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don\u2019t get Sansa POV of this interaction there\u2019s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we\u2019re in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we\u2019ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we\u2019re currently in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \u201cLet me see your stitches.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\u2019s attention. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, surrendering up her work.</i></p><p><i>The septa examined the fabric. \u201cArya, Arya, Arya,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will not do. This will not do at all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\u2019s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the pettier and crueler things Septa Mordane does. Instead of minimizing Arya\u2019s embarrassment, she amplifies it so she can preen and cast herself as long suffering. She truly is the worst.</p><p>There\u2019s also an interesting thing going on here where Arya\u2019s attributing things to Sansa that aren\u2019t actually happening. First she blames Sansa for attracting Mordane\u2019s attention, then thinks thinks Sansa is internally pleased at her embarrassment but just isn\u2019t showing it. In both instances there\u2019s no actual proof this is what\u2019s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\u2019s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there\u2019s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne. And while Sansa doesn\u2019t seem to have shut Jeyne down (though I can\u2019t remember if she ever knew Jeyne was doing that), it is worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t bully Arya, and outside of arguments doesn\u2019t seem to antagonize her.</p><p>This matters because Sansa and Jeyne despite being lumped together in Arya\u2019s head, actually occupy very different positions within Winterfell. I wish I had bookmarked it, but I just read a meta the other day about how galling Arya\u2019s existence must\u2019ve been for Jeyne; no matter how much closer she is to Sansa or better at feminine pursuits, Jeyne because of her birth will always be lower than Arya, never Sansa\u2019s true sister. Which is kind of fascinating when you remember that Jeyne will later be forced to be Arya when she\u2019s married to Ramsay. She gets what she wants, but very much not how she wanted it.</p><p>(this also makes me want to read a Jon x Jeyne AU. No? Just me? Fine)</p><blockquote><p><i>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i></p></blockquote><p>Being canonically bad at horse riding and math are strangely enough two things people tend to forget about Sansa. Partly I\u2019m sure it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t in the show, and partly it just doesn\u2019t really jive with the rest of Sansa\u2019s character. Being able to manage a household is part of the westerosi feminine ideal, and so it doesn\u2019t really make sense that she\u2019d be bad at it, especially considering how well she is at logistics and managing a household later on in the Eyrie. Chalking this one up to early installment weirdness seems fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \u201cCome,\u201d she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They [Arya and Nymeria] arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very Jon pose; composed, thoughtful, intent. It\u2019s actually low-key one of my favorite descriptions for just how much it tells you about Jon in just a few words. It\u2019s also very in keeping with how Bran described him in his chapter as slender and quick and graceful. Jon in these early chapters and from the viewpoint of Bran and Arya has a very different physicality to him than later when things are solely from his viewpoint. In these early chapters he\u2019s a little more bishie than later; partly because he\u2019s younger, partly because men don\u2019t think there appearance as much in fiction.</p><p>Which all on its own is interesting to contrast with Tyrion who is exceptionally aware of his body at all times, and the female characters who are much more attentive to what they wear and how they look. I tend to think it comes from Martin\u2019s, however subconscious, male gaze, but it also fits westeros: women from a young age are socialized to view themselves as sex objects and to be hyper aware of their attractiveness and appearance. It\u2019s sadly not that different from the real world.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon gave her a curious look. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya made a face at him. \u201cI wanted to see them fight.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiled. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more exhausting than needlework,\u201d Jon observed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more fun than needlework,\u201d Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\u2019s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s fear that her outsider qualities stem from bastardy hints at just how much damage Catelyn\u2019s ostracization of Jon seeps unintentionally into the rest of the starklings. As we saw when Sansa called Jon a bastard, Arya equates bastardy with otherness. It\u2019s no doubt one of the reasons she\u2019s so close to Jon as they both don\u2019t feel like they fit. That and his unquestioning acceptance of her less feminine coded interests.</p><p>And just like when he gave up having his own wolf so Bran and the other starklings could get theirs, we see again just how much Jon loves his siblings. It must\u2019ve stung for Arya to so blatantly unhappy about being like him, but he wasn\u2019t bitter about it. In general with his siblings Jon doesn\u2019t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down in the yard?\u201d Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. \u201cBastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Lannisters are proud,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cYou\u2019d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\u2019s House equal in honor to the king\u2019s.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe woman is important too!\u201d Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA wolf with a fish in its mouth?\u201d It made her laugh. \u201cThat would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\u2019t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. \u201cGirls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon\u2019s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon\u2019s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he\u2019s challenged with again and again.<br></p><p>It\u2019s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn\u2019t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn\u2019t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \u201cThe show is done,\u201d he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \u201cYou had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You\u2019ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya didn\u2019t think it was funny. \u201cI hate needlework!\u201d she said with passion. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is fair,\u201d Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it\u2019s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I\u2019m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there\u2019s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren\u2019t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they\u2019re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she\u2019s bad at them and there\u2019s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her \u201cthe woman matters too!\u201d exclamation, which is a far cry from her \u201cmost girls are dumb\u201d line later in the show. It\u2019s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it\u2019s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that\u2019s consistent with her character. We won\u2019t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won\u2019t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran\u2019s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p></p>",

Sure enough, people who read the negative news story rated that person&rsquo;s actions as more negative, while the people who read the positive news story rated their actions as more positive.</p><p>With Sansa all her negatives as a character are front loaded, and our perception of her is permanently tarnished by Arya&rsquo;s frustration and issues with her. This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p><blockquote><p><i>She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they&rsquo;re talking about it&rsquo;s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Joffrey likes your sister,&rdquo; Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell&rsquo;s steward and Sansa&rsquo;s dearest friend. &ldquo;He told her she was very beautiful.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to marry her,&rdquo; little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. &ldquo;Then Sansa will be queen of all the realm.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. &ldquo;Beth, you shouldn&rsquo;t make up stories,&rdquo; Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. &ldquo;What did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He&rsquo;s very gallant, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She&rsquo;s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn&rsquo;t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that&rsquo;s she engaged in it. I think there&rsquo;s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there&rsquo;s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Jon says he looks like a girl,&rdquo; Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. &ldquo;Poor Jon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He gets jealous because he&rsquo;s a bastard.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Sansa isn&rsquo;t completely off base here. If Jon&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it&rsquo;s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it&rsquo;ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it&rsquo;s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon&rsquo;s opinion because of his birth, she&rsquo;s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our brother,&rdquo; Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Our half brother,&rdquo; Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb &ldquo;Stark&rdquo;). There&rsquo;s a legitimate argument to be made that&rsquo;s Sansa&rsquo;s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we&rsquo;ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, &ldquo;He gets jealous because he&rsquo;s a bastard&rdquo; Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn&rsquo;t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don&rsquo;t get Sansa POV of this interaction there&rsquo;s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we&rsquo;re in Arya&rsquo;s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we&rsquo;ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we&rsquo;re currently in Arya&rsquo;s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Arya, why aren&rsquo;t you at work?&rdquo; the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. &ldquo;Let me see your stitches.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, surrendering up her work.</i></p><p><i>The septa examined the fabric. &ldquo;Arya, Arya, Arya,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This will not do. This will not do at all.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister&rsquo;s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the pettier and crueler things Septa Mordane does. Instead of minimizing Arya&rsquo;s embarrassment, she amplifies it so she can preen and cast herself as long suffering. She truly is the worst.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also an interesting thing going on here where Arya&rsquo;s attributing things to Sansa that aren&rsquo;t actually happening. First she blames Sansa for attracting Mordane&rsquo;s attention, then thinks thinks Sansa is internally pleased at her embarrassment but just isn&rsquo;t showing it. In both instances there&rsquo;s no actual proof this is what&rsquo;s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn&rsquo;t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother&rsquo;s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there&rsquo;s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne. And while Sansa doesn&rsquo;t seem to have shut Jeyne down (though I can&rsquo;t remember if she ever knew Jeyne was doing that), it is worth noting that Sansa doesn&rsquo;t bully Arya, and outside of arguments doesn&rsquo;t seem to antagonize her.</p><p>This matters because Sansa and Jeyne despite being lumped together in Arya&rsquo;s head, actually occupy very different positions within Winterfell. I wish I had bookmarked it, but I just read a meta the other day about how galling Arya&rsquo;s existence must&rsquo;ve been for Jeyne; no matter how much closer she is to Sansa or better at feminine pursuits, Jeyne because of her birth will always be lower than Arya, never Sansa&rsquo;s true sister. Which is kind of fascinating when you remember that Jeyne will later be forced to be Arya when she&rsquo;s married to Ramsay. She gets what she wants, but very much not how she wanted it.</p><p>(this also makes me want to read a Jon x Jeyne AU. No? Just me? Fine)</p><blockquote><p><i>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i></p></blockquote><p>Being canonically bad at horse riding and math are strangely enough two things people tend to forget about Sansa. Partly I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s that this isn&rsquo;t in the show, and partly it just doesn&rsquo;t really jive with the rest of Sansa&rsquo;s character. Being able to manage a household is part of the westerosi feminine ideal, and so it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense that she&rsquo;d be bad at it, especially considering how well she is at logistics and managing a household later on in the Eyrie. Chalking this one up to early installment weirdness seems fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They [Arya and Nymeria] arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very Jon pose; composed, thoughtful, intent. It&rsquo;s actually low-key one of my favorite descriptions for just how much it tells you about Jon in just a few words. It&rsquo;s also very in keeping with how Bran described him in his chapter as slender and quick and graceful. Jon in these early chapters and from the viewpoint of Bran and Arya has a very different physicality to him than later when things are solely from his viewpoint. In these early chapters he&rsquo;s a little more bishie than later; partly because he&rsquo;s younger, partly because men don&rsquo;t think there appearance as much in fiction.</p><p>Which all on its own is interesting to contrast with Tyrion who is exceptionally aware of his body at all times, and the female characters who are much more attentive to what they wear and how they look. I tend to think it comes from Martin&rsquo;s, however subconscious, male gaze, but it also fits westeros: women from a young age are socialized to view themselves as sex objects and to be hyper aware of their attractiveness and appearance. It&rsquo;s sadly not that different from the real world.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon gave her a curious look. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be working on your stitches, little sister?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Arya made a face at him. &ldquo;I wanted to see them fight.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He smiled. &ldquo;Come here, then.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A shade more exhausting than needlework,&rdquo; Jon observed.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A shade more fun than needlework,&rdquo; Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father&rsquo;s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya&rsquo;s fear that her outsider qualities stem from bastardy hints at just how much damage Catelyn&rsquo;s ostracization of Jon seeps unintentionally into the rest of the starklings. As we saw when Sansa called Jon a bastard, Arya equates bastardy with otherness. It&rsquo;s no doubt one of the reasons she&rsquo;s so close to Jon as they both don&rsquo;t feel like they fit. That and his unquestioning acceptance of her less feminine coded interests.</p><p>And just like when he gave up having his own wolf so Bran and the other starklings could get theirs, we see again just how much Jon loves his siblings. It must&rsquo;ve stung for Arya to so blatantly unhappy about being like him, but he wasn&rsquo;t bitter about it. In general with his siblings Jon doesn&rsquo;t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you down in the yard?&rdquo; Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. &ldquo;Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Lannisters are proud,&rdquo; Jon observed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother&rsquo;s House equal in honor to the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The woman is important too!&rdquo; Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. &ldquo;Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A wolf with a fish in its mouth?&rdquo; It made her laugh. &ldquo;That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can&rsquo;t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. &ldquo;Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon&rsquo;s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon&rsquo;s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he&rsquo;s challenged with again and again.<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn&rsquo;t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn&rsquo;t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. &ldquo;The show is done,&rdquo; he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. &ldquo;You had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You&rsquo;ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Arya didn&rsquo;t think it was funny. &ldquo;I hate needlework!&rdquo; she said with passion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nothing is fair,&rdquo; Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it&rsquo;s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there&rsquo;s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren&rsquo;t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they&rsquo;re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she&rsquo;s bad at them and there&rsquo;s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her &ldquo;the woman matters too!&rdquo; exclamation, which is a far cry from her &ldquo;most girls are dumb&rdquo; line later in the show. It&rsquo;s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it&rsquo;s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that&rsquo;s consistent with her character. We won&rsquo;t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won&rsquo;t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran&rsquo;s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p></p>",

But despite its simplicity, there&rsquo;s a lot going on in this chapter. Jon I introduced the first really big conflict in the Stark family (Jon vs Catelyn), and Arya I introduces the second (Sansa vs Arya). It also our first real introduction to Sansa; not just her as a person, but a character in her element and the social sphere she&rsquo;s most comfortable in. </p>\n<p>Martin has said before that he originally created Sansa as a contrast for Arya and to introduce some conflict into the Stark family, and that&rsquo;s very much in evidence in these first few chapters, starting with how in the second paragraph of her very first POV chapter Arya is already being contrasted unfavorably with Sansa by Septa Mordane.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Arya&rsquo;s stitches were crooked again.</i></p>\n<p><i>She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa&rsquo;s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. &ldquo;Sansa&rsquo;s work is as pretty as she is,&rdquo; Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. &ldquo;She has such fine, delicate hands.&rdquo; When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. &ldquo;Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.&rdquo;</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a perception in fandom that Sansa and Arya fundamentally don&rsquo;t like each other or that Sansa was condescending to Arya, but something that&rsquo;s underrated is just how much the two are actively pitted against each other by Septa Mordane. And this is as good a time as any to mention that Septa Mordane fails epically in her role as a mentor and is kind of a dick. It&rsquo;s one thing for Septa Mordane to not want to encourage Arya&rsquo;s more rambunctious interests, but it&rsquo;s entirely another for her to constantly beat Arya down and reinforce her negative self image.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate in a lot of ways that Arya&rsquo;s POV comes before Sansa&rsquo;s.
