It&rsquo;s just their very first kiss, first described through Sansa&rsquo;s eyes and then through Jon&rsquo;s.<br/></i></small></b></p></blockquote><p><b><i>Sansa&rsquo;s POV</i></b></p><p>Sansa had read a thousand books about this moment, but somehow she was not sure if any of those books had really managed to capture how it truly felt. She felt a certain kind of pleasant nervousness in her stomach. Her skin tingled wherever his hands and body touched her and her heart was beating rapidly in her chest with longing excitement.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201d Jon spoke softly and Sansa let out a deep breath, cursing because he dared to make her wait even one more moment, one more second. </p><p>She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek and nodded firmly. \u201cI&rsquo;ve never been this sure about anything, Jon.\u201d </p><p>In literally every book Sansa had ever read, the girl had been standing on the tips of her toes right now, but Sansa didn\u2019t need to do so. She was glad that she was wearing her flats tonight instead of the high heels Margaery had tried to make her wear.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful tonight.\u201d Jon tucked a strand of strawberry blond hair behind her ear and he pressed her tighter to his chest, if that was even possible. </p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Sansa raised her voice while she closed her eyes. \u201cCan you stop talking, please?\u201d She licked her dry lips and pressed her forehead to his. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked more than enough during the last few weeks. I want this. And I want this now.\u201d</p><p>Jon curled his lips up into a smile and then his nose brushed hers. </p><!-- more --><p>She was not sure if he did it on purpose, if he knew how badly she wanted this, how deeply she was longing for this. For weeks she had wondered if Jon really felt the same for her as she felt for him and tonight she had not been capable of stopping herself anymore. </p><p>She had just asked him. She had just asked him if he thought about her day and night, just like she always seemed to be thinking about him these days. She had just asked him if he dreamed about her, just like all her dreams now seemed to be about him. She had just asked him if he sometimes wondered how it would be to kiss her, to touch her, to make love under a blanket of stars. </p><p>And he had said yes. His cheeks had reddened and pearls of sweat had covered his forehead. Sansa had not really understood why. She had been the one taking a risk. She had been the one taking the first step. </p><p>And now she was waiting for him to take the next one. And the longer it took, the more frustrated and excited she got.</p><p>When she felt his breath warming her waiting lips she closed her eyes and her arms circled around his neck. After what seemed to be another eternity his lips finally found hers.</p><p>They were surprisingly soft and tender and his kiss was slow and a little reluctantly.</p><p>But Sansa wanted more. Sansa needed more. And while her hands went through his dark curls, her lips parted to invite his tongue in.</p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>Jon&rsquo;s POV</i></b></p><p>Jon had kissed girls before. Most of the kisses hadn\u2019t really meant much, apart from that one time he thought he had been in love. He was not sure what he and Ygritte had really felt for each other, but every time he looked at Sansa now he was certain it had not been love. This was love. What he felt now was love. And he was terrified that somehow he would break it.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201d He spoke softly, dreading the moment. Somehow he was still afraid that at some point she\u2019d discover that she could get someone much better and much smarter than him.</p><p>She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek and nodded firmly. \u201cI&rsquo;ve never been this sure about anything, Jon.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why he couldn\u2019t really believe her. He wasn&rsquo;t sure why there was always a voice in the back of his mind telling him that this was just a dream, that this was temporary, that somehow he\u2019d find a way to ruin it, to break it. That somehow he wouldn\u2019t get the girl.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful tonight.\u201d Jon tucked a strand of strawberry blond hair behind her ear and he pressed her tighter to his chest because he was afraid she would slip through his fingers if he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Sansa raised her voice while she closed her eyes. \u201cCan you stop talking, please?\u201d She licked her lips and pressed her warm forehead to his. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked more than enough during the last few weeks. I want this. And I want this now.\u201d</p><p>A strange, but pleasant warmth spread through his body. He curled his lips up into a smile and he let his nose brush hers. He didn\u2019t know why he was so terrified of just kissing her. He didn\u2019t know why he was hesitating. He didn\u2019t know why he couldn\u2019t just lean in and do it.</p><p>He had never been someone\u2019s first choice. He had never been someone\u2019s everything and someone\u2019s world. And he had never dared to make someone else his first choice, his everything, his world. He knew all too well how things could change all of a sudden. </p><p>Friends could become foes within an instant. Those closest to you could eventually betray you. Trusting someone too much, could eventually lead to misery and pain.</p><p>Somehow he didn\u2019t dare to fully believe Sansa when she had told him that she thought about him all day, that she dreamed about him at night, that she had fantasized about kissing him and loving him.

She had just asked him if he thought about her day and night, just like she always seemed to be thinking about him these days. She had just asked him if he dreamed about her, just like all her dreams now seemed to be about him. She had just asked him if he sometimes wondered how it would be to kiss her, to touch her, to make love under a blanket of stars. </p><p>And he had said yes. His cheeks had reddened and pearls of sweat had covered his forehead. Sansa had not really understood why. She had been the one taking a risk.

Sansa needed more. And while her hands went through his dark curls, her lips parted to invite his tongue in.</p><p><b><i><br></i></b></p><p><b><i>Jon\u2019s POV</i></b></p><p>Jon had kissed girls before. Most of the kisses hadn\u2019t really meant much, apart from that one time he thought he had been in love. He was not sure what he and Ygritte had really felt for each other, but every time he looked at Sansa now he was certain it had not been love. This was love. What he felt now was love. And he was terrified that somehow he would break it.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201d He spoke softly, dreading the moment. Somehow he was still afraid that at some point she\u2019d discover that she could get someone much better and much smarter than him.</p><p>She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek and nodded firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve never been this sure about anything, Jon.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why he couldn\u2019t really believe her. He wasn\u2019t sure why there was always a voice in the back of his mind telling him that this was just a dream, that this was temporary, that somehow he\u2019d find a way to ruin it, to break it. That somehow he wouldn\u2019t get the girl.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful tonight.\u201d Jon tucked a strand of strawberry blond hair behind her ear and he pressed her tighter to his chest because he was afraid she would slip through his fingers if he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJon!\u201d Sansa raised her voice while she closed her eyes. \u201cCan you stop talking, please?\u201d She licked her lips and pressed her warm forehead to his. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked more than enough during the last few weeks. I want this. And I want this now.\u201d</p><p>A strange, but pleasant warmth spread through his body. He curled his lips up into a smile and he let his nose brush hers. He didn\u2019t know why he was so terrified of just kissing her. He didn\u2019t know why he was hesitating. He didn\u2019t know why he couldn\u2019t just lean in and do it.</p><p>He had never been someone\u2019s first choice. He had never been someone\u2019s everything and someone\u2019s world. And he had never dared to make someone else his first choice, his everything, his world. He knew all too well how things could change all of a sudden. </p><p>Friends could become foes within an instant. Those closest to you could eventually betray you. Trusting someone too much, could eventually lead to misery and pain.</p><p>Somehow he didn\u2019t dare to fully believe Sansa when she had told him that she thought about him all day, that she dreamed about him at night, that she had fantasized about kissing him and loving him. He knew he didn\u2019t have a reason to doubt her, but it was still hard to believe that someone as amazing and beautiful as her, would fall for someone like him.</p><p>Maybe he would somehow start believing it when he did kiss her and when she would kiss him back. </p><p>He leaned in and waited a few more seconds before he pressed his lips to hers.

Her arms circled around his neck, but in the back of his mind Jon could still hear a voice telling him that if he&rsquo;d go any further, the dream would explode and he&rsquo;d wake up. </p><p>But Sansa&rsquo;s hands went through his hair and the moment she parted her lips to invite his tongue in he finally realized that she meant it.</p><p>She really meant it.</p><p>And eagerly, giving into his own hunger and desire eventually, he accepted her invitation.</p></p>",

She felt a certain kind of pleasant nervousness in her stomach. Her skin tingled wherever his hands and body touched her and her heart was beating rapidly in her chest with longing excitement.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want this?&rdquo; Jon spoke softly and Sansa let out a deep breath, cursing because he dared to make her wait even one more moment, one more second. </p>\n<p>She pressed the palm of her hand to his stubbled cheek and nodded firmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been this sure about anything, Jon.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>In literally every book Sansa had ever read, the girl had been standing on the tips of her toes right now, but Sansa didn&rsquo;t need to do so. She was glad that she was wearing her flats tonight instead of the high heels Margaery had tried to make her wear.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You look beautiful tonight.&rdquo; Jon tucked a strand of strawberry blond hair behind her ear and he pressed her tighter to his chest, if that was even possible. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; Sansa raised her voice while she closed her eyes. &ldquo;Can you stop talking, please?&rdquo; She licked her dry lips and pressed her forehead to his. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve talked more than enough during the last few weeks. I want this. And I want this now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jon curled his lips up into a smile and then his nose brushed hers. </p>\n</p>",

You will have until December 22nd to make a gift that somehow incorporates the prompt. And during that time you will also need to send your giftee Anonymous Love to help show Christmas Spirit!</p><p>If there are any other questions you might have, send me an ask <a href=\"https://sansansecretsanta.tumblr.com/ask\">here</a>. &nbsp;And make sure you follow this blog so you can get the latest updates!</p></p>",

If grrm plans it to be a united land at the end at all, if not separate kingdoms. We know for sure cersie isn\u2019t living through this lmao so its either daenerys (come full circle with a targareyn on the throne) or sansa (come full circle with petyr\u2019s masterplan/will from the very beginning) idk im just guessing",

Margaery, also a queen, and in clear rivalry with Cersei for power and influence. Third queen is debatable. Could be Dany and that makes a lot of sense. We just don\u2019t know how much Baelish might know about Dany or not. I\u2019ve heard it suggested it might be Olenna\u00a0\u2018the Queen of thorns\u2019.</p><p>but yeah. It\u2019s not a prophecy, it\u2019s not a magical statement or prediction, it\u2019s a current anaylsis from a smart man looking at the CURRENT politics, so i think it\u2019s current queens, so, not sansa. I could be wrong, but it\u2019s just how I see it having been said in the way it was. I of course still believe Petyr is moving Sansa towards as much power as he can get her too.</p>",

Sorry.</p><p>As for the delusional part, Over time Lysa had grown into a closed off, grief stricken, paranoid and obsessive mother who\u2019d had a pretty sad life filled with little love. And again, had a lack of smarts. Baelish manipulated all of this, and again, she was so susceptible to him because of how much she\u2019d loved him since childhood. he deluded her. she was delusional in regards to him and really went off the deep end with jealously and despair in the end. Sansa? She\u2019s not delusional. I think she\u2019s a teenage girl, who compartmentalises things and subconsciously twists the truth to better deal with it, and she\u2019s wilfully ignorant to a lot of things that she doesn\u2019t want to deal with and face. The poisoning with sweetrobin, as an example. Subconsciously she knows what\u2019s happening, but the idea of a child dying so she can advance in her life is such a harrowing thing, she ignores it. she just needs to make sure he keeps taking sweetsleep, that\u2019s all. The reality and consequences, she purposefully ignores. It\u2019s not delusional, because we do see a sense of her understanding and she knows the weight of her situation, she\u2019s not in a position to go against Baelish\u2019s plan even if she wanted to and she\u2019s smart enough to know that, so then it a matter of her willingly pushing the whole cruel reality of it down. Like, i\u2019m going to put this guilt and my morals and what my parents might think of me for doing this in a box and we\u2019re just going to shut the box and not look at it, and it\u2019s fine, this is fine.</p><p>\u2018not as brave as their sisters\u2019, don\u2019t really want to get into it with this one, just that I think Lysa is the only one who I wouldn\u2019t classify as brave, Cat, Sansa and Arya all have their own type and moments of bravery.</p><p>Also, Lysa is so different to sansa in most ways. she doesn\u2019t thrive socially, men dont chase her, shes NEVER bothered to be courteous, her emotions are all over the place and run her life, and all these things are the opposite of Sansa. Like. complete opposite.</p><p>Im also not saying cat and sansa are alike in EVERYTHING, it\u2019s just that the text MADE the links. Sansa is ladylike like her mother, pretty like her mother, the same colouring as her mother etc, and because the text deliberately makes the links, I feel like it matters more than say, similarities sansa might have with daenerys. Those similarities may exist, but they weren\u2019t ever MADE by the book. That\u2019s more my point. The book purposefully links sansa and cat, and arya and lyanna. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re the only characters that have similarites to the girls, or that they\u2019re exactly like these characters, ALL of these ladies are their own characters, but the books made these two links really clear.</p>",

It\u2019s not delusional, because we do see a sense of her understanding and she knows the weight of her situation, she\u2019s not in a position to go against Baelish\u2019s plan even if she wanted to and she\u2019s smart enough to know that, so then it a matter of her willingly pushing the whole cruel reality of it down. Like, i\u2019m going to put this guilt and my morals and what my parents might think of me for doing this in a box and we\u2019re just going to shut the box and not look at it, and it\u2019s fine, this is fine.</p><p>\u2018not as brave as their sisters\u2019, don\u2019t really want to get into it with this one, just that I think Lysa is the only one who I wouldn\u2019t classify as brave, Cat, Sansa and Arya all have their own type and moments of bravery.</p><p>Also, Lysa is so different to sansa in most ways. she doesn\u2019t thrive socially, men dont chase her, shes NEVER bothered to be courteous, her emotions are all over the place and run her life, and all these things are the opposite of Sansa. Like. complete opposite.</p><p>Im also not saying cat and sansa are alike in EVERYTHING, it\u2019s just that the text MADE the links. Sansa is ladylike like her mother, pretty like her mother, the same colouring as her mother etc, and because the text deliberately makes the links, I feel like it matters more than say, similarities sansa might have with daenerys. Those similarities may exist, but they weren\u2019t ever MADE by the book. That\u2019s more my point. The book purposefully links sansa and cat, and arya and lyanna. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re the only characters that have similarites to the girls, or that they\u2019re exactly like these characters, ALL of these ladies are their own characters, but the books made these two links really clear.</p>",
                "content": "<p>saying a character has narrative parralells or a connection or a resembles with another character doesnt mean they match up exactly on all points or are carbon copies of the other.</p><p>I also don&rsquo;t think sansa and lysa have that much in common. &lsquo;Are clever yet delusional&rsquo;, firstly, Lysa never struck me as clever. She also has little social graces ,refusing to give her aid to any house, wether this could help her or not, theres no political thought farther than&nbsp;&lsquo;im scared and dont want to, leave me alone&rsquo;. Then even in her own sphere, showering favour on one unpopular courtier and then refusing another husband or favor to other households generally leaving everyone pissed off. like&hellip;.Lysa wasn&rsquo;t smart in anything she did. Sorry.</p><p>As for the delusional part, Over time Lysa had grown into a closed off, grief stricken, paranoid and obsessive mother who&rsquo;d had a pretty sad life filled with little love. And again, had a lack of smarts. Baelish manipulated all of this, and again, she was so susceptible to him because of how much she&rsquo;d loved him since childhood. he deluded her. she was delusional in regards to him and really went off the deep end with jealously and despair in the end. Sansa? She&rsquo;s not delusional. I think she&rsquo;s a teenage girl, who compartmentalises things and subconsciously twists the truth to better deal with it, and she&rsquo;s wilfully ignorant to a lot of things that she doesn&rsquo;t want to deal with and face. The poisoning with sweetrobin, as an example. Subconsciously she knows what&rsquo;s happening, but the idea of a child dying so she can advance in her life is such a harrowing thing, she ignores it. she just needs to make sure he keeps taking sweetsleep, that&rsquo;s all. The reality and consequences, she purposefully ignores. It&rsquo;s not delusional, because we do see a sense of her understanding and she knows the weight of her situation, she&rsquo;s not in a position to go against Baelish&rsquo;s plan even if she wanted to and she&rsquo;s smart enough to know that, so then it a matter of her willingly pushing the whole cruel reality of it down.
