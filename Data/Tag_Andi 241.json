There\u2019s gonna be candy and \ndancing and\u2026a costume contest!\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy pretended to \nthink it over, his lips curling into a smile. \u201cAlright, I suppose I\u2019ll \ngo,\u201d he sighed playfully, \u201cI <i>will</i> be winning the contest after all, I look great,\u201d</p><p>TJ silently agreed that Cyrus indeed <i>did</i>\n look great, what with his handsome Peter Pan costume.

It looked breathtakingly spooky, according to Cyrus.</p><p>The moment they entered the door, the volume of the music hit them like a brick wall because <i>man</i>\n was it loud. And Cyrus would have complained were it not for them \nplaying the Monster Mash, arguably the best Halloween song ever written.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, you made it!\u201d Andi shouted across the room, squeezing between a vampire and a fairy to make her way over to her friend.</p><p>\u201cTJ\n convinced me to come,\u201d he said with a shrug, looking over his shoulder \nto see TJ gently bopping his head along to the rhythm. Turning back to \nAndi, he said \u201cWhen\u2019s the costume contest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little later. I \nthink we\u2019re going to do bobbing for apples in a few minutes, but \notherwise you can just hang out, dance a little, and grab something to \neat,\u201d she offered, adjusting her whiskers. Her makeup looked incredible,\n thanks to Bex and her godly makeup skills.</p><p>\u201cAndi, you\u2019re gonna \nmiss the apple bobbing!\u201d Buffy drawled, grabbing the girl\u2019s hand and \ndragging her away. Andi mustered a garbled \u201csee ya!\u201d to Cyrus and TJ, \nand was then swept away in a cloud of bodies.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d TJ asked, nodding his head in the direction of the vortex that took Andi and Buffy.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApple bobbing, duh,\u201d he stated as if obvious, \u201cgive it a go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll mess up this,\u201d he gestured vaguely to his costume, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cPlease, you look good all the time,\u201d TJ replied, his face burning a crimson red. That sounded a little <i>too</i> flirty. Well, he <i>meant</i> it to be flirty, but those were things he usually said in his head, and not out loud.</p><p>But\n Cyrus merely smiled wider, his brows raising slightly. \u201cSoftie,\u201d he \ngiggled, grabbing his hand and dragging them to the kitchen, \u201cI\u2019m going \nbobbing for apples and, dammit, I\u2019m gonna look good doing it,\u201d</p><p><i>Damn right you are,</i> TJ thought to himself, as Cyrus released his hand and wandered over to a free bucket.</p><!-- more --><hr><p>\u201cListen\n up!\u201d Bex shouted over the noise, \u201cyou have one minute to get as many \napples as you can from the water into the green bucket. You cannot use \nyour hands or any clothing as help,\u201d she added, raising her brows at \nAndi, who merely smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cYou got this, Underdog,\u201d TJ clapped him on the back, stepping back to watch.</p><p>\u201cOn your marks, get set, go!\u201d Bex shouted, starting the timer and wincing as the other children cheered for their friends.</p><p>\u201cGo Cyrus!\u201d TJ yelled as loud as he could. He wasn\u2019t able to see very much of the competition, but he cheered nonetheless.</p><p>Cyrus,\n on the other hand, was regretting his choices. Not only did he not like\n the absurd amount of noise, but he was already coughing up water ten \nseconds into the competition. He tried to grip the apples, but they kept\n slipping, and he would get more and more frustrated. When Bex called \ntime, he immediately reached for the towel to dry his face and hair off.\n He\u2019d only managed to get one apple out of the bucket.</p><p>\u201cAnd the \nwinner is\u2026Evan, with 6 apples!\u201d Bex announced cheerily, \u201cthank you \nguys for playing, we\u2019ll be having another round later. Now go have fun!\u201d\n She grabbed a towel from the cupboard and began to clean up all of the \nwater that had spilled.</p><p>\u201cNice job,\u201d Cyrus congratulated Evan, \n\u201calthough, you kinda ruined your goth makeup,\u201d he giggled. Evan had gone\n as one of the band members from KISS, and the black paint was bleeding.</p><p>\u201cEh, worth it,\u201d he shrugged, grabbing a paper towel to try and dab off the excess water, \u201cnice job to you too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n please,\u201d Cyrus scoffed, adjusting his hat, \u201cthat was pitiful and you \nknow it.\u201d He playfully punched the other boys arm, a cascade of laughter\n following.</p><p>TJ sat back and watched, torn between yelling \nsomething or running off. Unfortunately, Halloween magic had cemented \nhis feet into the wooden floor. A lump rose in his throat and he did his\n best to choke it back. But he couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous from \nseeing Cyrus with Evan. And it <i>killed</i> him that he knew that Evan was gay.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d\n Evan cleared his throat, his eyes darting down to Cyrus\u2019 shoes and \ntrailing all the way back up, \u201cI was wondering if you wanted to, maybe, \ncatch a movie this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019d be great! TJ actually really wanted to see this movie, some superhero one, and he\u2019d love to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d\n the other boy cut in, \u201cI was thinking it could just be me and you,\u201d he \nmurmured, smiling sheepishly. For a split second, his gaze met TJ\u2019s, \nbefore TJ stormed away, holding his breath so he didn\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026like a <i>date</i>?\u201d\n Cyrus questioned, toying nervously with the hem of his shirt. Since \nwhen was Evan gay? Or bi? Or\u2026not straight? Was he even asking him out \non a date? Or was it just a \u2018hang\u2019?</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he admitted, tossing his blonde locks back, \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know if you even <i>like</i> boys but, I figured I\u2019d shoot my shot,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\n offered him a sympathetic smile. \u201cEvan, I\u2019m really flattered,\u201d he \nstarted, and felt his stomach knot seeing the other boy\u2019s face fall \nslightly, \u201cand for the record, I <i>do </i>like guys, but I just, I don\u2019t feel the same,\u201d he admitted, feeling almost guilty, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Evan replied albeit shakily, \u201cat least you\u2019re not leaving me on. And knowing that you like boys makes things <i>so</i> much clearer,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, grabbing an apple from the bucket and taking a bite.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou and Kippen,\u201d he stated simply, and Cyrus nearly choked.</p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d he coughed, tears budding at the corner of his eyes from trying to clear his throat.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre\n you blind? He\u2019s, like, really into you. And I wasn\u2019t sure if you were \ninto guys, so I just assumed you were good friends. But you like him, \ndon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Cyrus opened his mouth to reply, turning his head\n to see where TJ was last, but he wasn\u2019t there, \u201cneed to go find TJ,\u201d he\n said instead, offering a quick smile before he slid out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGo\n get your man!\u201d he heard Evan call from the kitchen. Shaking his head, \nhe squeezed through the throng of middle schoolers, but couldn\u2019t find TJ\n anywhere. Deciding that he had had enough of all the noise, he grabbed a\n few brownies and a soda, and headed up the stairs.</p><hr><p>By\n the time he reached the top, the music was already significantly \nsofter, and he could finally exhale a breath he didn\u2019t know he was \nholding. Figuring Andi wouldn\u2019t be upset if he hung out in her room, he \npushed open the door and nearly dropped his soda on the ground when he \nsaw TJ in there.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d he sputtered, placing his snacks on Andi\u2019s dresser, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you all night! Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\n don\u2019t you just go back and hang out with your boyfriend,\u201d he spat out, \nkicking his shoes off and crossing his legs on her bed.</p><p>\u201cMy-<i>what</i> are you talking about?\u201d Shutting the door, Cyrus approached the other boy, sitting a few feet away from him on the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me,\u201d he hissed, \u201cyou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-<i>Evan</i>? Are you talking about him?\u201d he asked incredulously, his brows shooting up to his hairline.</p><p>\u201cHe\n was totally flirting with you, Cyrus! Did you not notice?\u201d The taller \nboy\u2019s voice shrunk as he spoke, failing to uphold his bravado tone.</p><p>\u201cI mean, after he asked me on a date, I kind of figured,\u201d he chuckled, but stopped on behalf of seeing TJ\u2019s frown deepen.</p><p>\u201cJust\n go back to him. Have fun on your date.\u201d He swiftly turned around to \nface the wall, digging his teeth harshly into his lower lip.</p><p>Now it was Cyrus\u2019 turn to frown. \u201cI don\u2019t like Evan. I mean, I don\u2019t <i>hate</i> him, but I don\u2019t like him more than a friend,\u201d</p><p>TJ, unconvinced merely said \u201cSeemed like you did when you were laughing it up,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\n was a self-deprecating joke about my apple bobbing abilities, Teej,\u201d \nCyrus informed him, \u201cbesides, why do you even care so much? You\u2019re \nacting weird,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not,\u201d he retorted lamely, although he knew it was true. He <i>knew</i> why he was acting up, why he had stormed out of the kitchen, and why he was now on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cOh,\n really?\u201d Cyrus scoffed, a hint of sass creeping its way into his voice,\n \u201cthen why don\u2019t you explain to me why you\u2019re getting so worked up over \nsome <i>guy</i> asking me out on a date, which, might I remind you, I turned down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you okay? Happy now?\u201d TJ spat out, turning to face Cyrus. One blink and all the tears would fall.</p><p>What\n followed was a moment of silence, save for the thumping music \ndownstairs. TJ thought he was going to faint or throw up or both. Cyrus \njust sat there, stunned. After a few moments, he broke out into a small \nfit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is it just <i>so</i> funny that I like you? Is it just that pathetic?\u201d TJ huffed, hugging a pillow to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo! Just\u2026Evan was right. You <i>do</i> like me,\u201d he chuckled, and TJ\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cHow would he even know that? I never told him about that,\u201d he muttered, his hands squeezing the pillow.</p><p>\u201cHe\n told me that he saw the way you looked at me. And I basically told him \n\u2018yeah, right\u2019 but\u2026I guess he was right,\u201d Cyrus admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd \nthis is the part of the movie where you say you don\u2019t feel the same and I\n just nod and dissolve into tears,\u201d TJ said shakily, feeling his eyes \nsting harshly from the tears forming.</p><p>\u201cActually this is the part where I tell you that I like you too,\u201d he whispered, his cheeks turning an embarrassing shade of red.</p><p>Before\n TJ could comprehend what Cyrus said, the shorter boy was already \nleaning in and connecting their lips. It was soft and gentle, and TJ \ncouldn\u2019t help but smile into it, a few loose tears slipping down his \nface.</p><p>Unfortunately, humans need air to survive, so they had to pull away to take in air. Both boys were giggling, blushing messes.</p><p>\u201c<i>Now</i> will you stop acting weird?\u201d Cyrus whispered against the other boy\u2019s lips, stealing a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cMm, only if I can kiss you again,\u201d TJ smirked, leaning in and touching their noses together.</p><p>\u201cI supposed tha-\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was cut off by Andi and Buffy pushing open the door, their hands entangled and Buffy\u2019s lips on Andi\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-Cyrus?\u201d Andi gawked, her eyes widening, \u201cwhat the heck are you doing in here? With TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d he countered, smirking when he saw both girls blush madly.</p><p>\u201cFair\n point. I wanted to say that you missed the costume contest, and I was \nlooking for you, and then Buffy tagged along and we were looking for you\n and then\u2026yeah,\u201d she explained hurriedly, \u201csorry you missed it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said with a smile, nuzzling his head against TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou were the best looking out there, Underdog,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d Buffy countered playfully, pecking Andi\u2019s cheek quickly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gay,\u201d TJ replied childishly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all gay, TJ,\u201d</p><p>tag list:<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsIkR1GJgSJuWbP-DN9ydA\">@seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ghostswasp</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> ||\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz</a></p>",

Not only did he not like\n the absurd amount of noise, but he was already coughing up water ten \nseconds into the competition. He tried to grip the apples, but they kept\n slipping, and he would get more and more frustrated. When Bex called \ntime, he immediately reached for the towel to dry his face and hair off.\n He\u2019d only managed to get one apple out of the bucket.</p><p>\u201cAnd the \nwinner is\u2026Evan, with 6 apples!\u201d Bex announced cheerily, \u201cthank you \nguys for playing, we\u2019ll be having another round later. Now go have fun!\u201d\n She grabbed a towel from the cupboard and began to clean up all of the \nwater that had spilled.</p><p>\u201cNice job,\u201d Cyrus congratulated Evan, \n\u201calthough, you kinda ruined your goth makeup,\u201d he giggled. Evan had gone\n as one of the band members from KISS, and the black paint was bleeding.</p><p>\u201cEh, worth it,\u201d he shrugged, grabbing a paper towel to try and dab off the excess water, \u201cnice job to you too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n please,\u201d Cyrus scoffed, adjusting his hat, \u201cthat was pitiful and you \nknow it.\u201d He playfully punched the other boys arm, a cascade of laughter\n following.</p><p>TJ sat back and watched, torn between yelling \nsomething or running off. Unfortunately, Halloween magic had cemented \nhis feet into the wooden floor. A lump rose in his throat and he did his\n best to choke it back. But he couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous from \nseeing Cyrus with Evan. And it <i>killed</i> him that he knew that Evan was gay.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d\n Evan cleared his throat, his eyes darting down to Cyrus\u2019 shoes and \ntrailing all the way back up, \u201cI was wondering if you wanted to, maybe, \ncatch a movie this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019d be great! TJ actually really wanted to see this movie, some superhero one, and he\u2019d love to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d\n the other boy cut in, \u201cI was thinking it could just be me and you,\u201d he \nmurmured, smiling sheepishly. For a split second, his gaze met TJ\u2019s, \nbefore TJ stormed away, holding his breath so he didn\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026like a <i>date</i>?\u201d\n Cyrus questioned, toying nervously with the hem of his shirt. Since \nwhen was Evan gay? Or bi? Or\u2026not straight? Was he even asking him out \non a date? Or was it just a \u2018hang\u2019?</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he admitted, tossing his blonde locks back, \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know if you even <i>like</i> boys but, I figured I\u2019d shoot my shot,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\n offered him a sympathetic smile. \u201cEvan, I\u2019m really flattered,\u201d he \nstarted, and felt his stomach knot seeing the other boy\u2019s face fall \nslightly, \u201cand for the record, I <i>do </i>like guys, but I just, I don\u2019t feel the same,\u201d he admitted, feeling almost guilty, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Evan replied albeit shakily, \u201cat least you\u2019re not leaving me on. And knowing that you like boys makes things <i>so</i> much clearer,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, grabbing an apple from the bucket and taking a bite.<br></p><p>\u201cYou and Kippen,\u201d he stated simply, and Cyrus nearly choked.</p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d he coughed, tears budding at the corner of his eyes from trying to clear his throat.<br></p><p>\u201cAre\n you blind? He\u2019s, like, really into you. And I wasn\u2019t sure if you were \ninto guys, so I just assumed you were good friends. But you like him, \ndon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Cyrus opened his mouth to reply, turning his head\n to see where TJ was last, but he wasn\u2019t there, \u201cneed to go find TJ,\u201d he\n said instead, offering a quick smile before he slid out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGo\n get your man!\u201d he heard Evan call from the kitchen. Shaking his head, \nhe squeezed through the throng of middle schoolers, but couldn\u2019t find TJ\n anywhere. Deciding that he had had enough of all the noise, he grabbed a\n few brownies and a soda, and headed up the stairs.</p><hr><p>By\n the time he reached the top, the music was already significantly \nsofter, and he could finally exhale a breath he didn\u2019t know he was \nholding. Figuring Andi wouldn\u2019t be upset if he hung out in her room, he \npushed open the door and nearly dropped his soda on the ground when he \nsaw TJ in there.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d he sputtered, placing his snacks on Andi\u2019s dresser, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you all night! Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\n don\u2019t you just go back and hang out with your boyfriend,\u201d he spat out, \nkicking his shoes off and crossing his legs on her bed.</p><p>\u201cMy-<i>what</i> are you talking about?\u201d Shutting the door, Cyrus approached the other boy, sitting a few feet away from him on the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me,\u201d he hissed, \u201cyou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-<i>Evan</i>? Are you talking about him?\u201d he asked incredulously, his brows shooting up to his hairline.</p><p>\u201cHe\n was totally flirting with you, Cyrus! Did you not notice?\u201d The taller \nboy\u2019s voice shrunk as he spoke, failing to uphold his bravado tone.</p><p>\u201cI mean, after he asked me on a date, I kind of figured,\u201d he chuckled, but stopped on behalf of seeing TJ\u2019s frown deepen.</p><p>\u201cJust\n go back to him. Have fun on your date.\u201d He swiftly turned around to \nface the wall, digging his teeth harshly into his lower lip.</p><p>Now it was Cyrus\u2019 turn to frown. \u201cI don\u2019t like Evan. I mean, I don\u2019t <i>hate</i> him, but I don\u2019t like him more than a friend,\u201d</p><p>TJ, unconvinced merely said \u201cSeemed like you did when you were laughing it up,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\n was a self-deprecating joke about my apple bobbing abilities, Teej,\u201d \nCyrus informed him, \u201cbesides, why do you even care so much? You\u2019re \nacting weird,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not,\u201d he retorted lamely, although he knew it was true. He <i>knew</i> why he was acting up, why he had stormed out of the kitchen, and why he was now on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cOh,\n really?\u201d Cyrus scoffed, a hint of sass creeping its way into his voice,\n \u201cthen why don\u2019t you explain to me why you\u2019re getting so worked up over \nsome <i>guy</i> asking me out on a date, which, might I remind you, I turned down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you okay? Happy now?\u201d TJ spat out, turning to face Cyrus. One blink and all the tears would fall.</p><p>What\n followed was a moment of silence, save for the thumping music \ndownstairs. TJ thought he was going to faint or throw up or both. Cyrus \njust sat there, stunned. After a few moments, he broke out into a small \nfit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is it just <i>so</i> funny that I like you? Is it just that pathetic?\u201d TJ huffed, hugging a pillow to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo! Just\u2026Evan was right. You <i>do</i> like me,\u201d he chuckled, and TJ\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cHow would he even know that? I never told him about that,\u201d he muttered, his hands squeezing the pillow.</p><p>\u201cHe\n told me that he saw the way you looked at me. And I basically told him \n\u2018yeah, right\u2019 but\u2026I guess he was right,\u201d Cyrus admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd \nthis is the part of the movie where you say you don\u2019t feel the same and I\n just nod and dissolve into tears,\u201d TJ said shakily, feeling his eyes \nsting harshly from the tears forming.</p><p>\u201cActually this is the part where I tell you that I like you too,\u201d he whispered, his cheeks turning an embarrassing shade of red.</p><p>Before\n TJ could comprehend what Cyrus said, the shorter boy was already \nleaning in and connecting their lips. It was soft and gentle, and TJ \ncouldn\u2019t help but smile into it, a few loose tears slipping down his \nface.</p><p>Unfortunately, humans need air to survive, so they had to pull away to take in air. Both boys were giggling, blushing messes.</p><p>\u201c<i>Now</i> will you stop acting weird?\u201d Cyrus whispered against the other boy\u2019s lips, stealing a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cMm, only if I can kiss you again,\u201d TJ smirked, leaning in and touching their noses together.</p><p>\u201cI supposed tha-\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was cut off by Andi and Buffy pushing open the door, their hands entangled and Buffy\u2019s lips on Andi\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-Cyrus?\u201d Andi gawked, her eyes widening, \u201cwhat the heck are you doing in here? With TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d he countered, smirking when he saw both girls blush madly.</p><p>\u201cFair\n point. I wanted to say that you missed the costume contest, and I was \nlooking for you, and then Buffy tagged along and we were looking for you\n and then\u2026yeah,\u201d she explained hurriedly, \u201csorry you missed it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said with a smile, nuzzling his head against TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou were the best looking out there, Underdog,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d Buffy countered playfully, pecking Andi\u2019s cheek quickly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gay,\u201d TJ replied childishly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all gay, TJ,\u201d</p><p>tag list:<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsIkR1GJgSJuWbP-DN9ydA\">@seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ghostswasp</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> ||\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz</a></p>",

There\u2019s gonna be candy and \ndancing and\u2026a costume contest!\u201d</p><p>The shorter boy pretended to \nthink it over, his lips curling into a smile. \u201cAlright, I suppose I\u2019ll \ngo,\u201d he sighed playfully, \u201cI <i>will</i> be winning the contest after all, I look great,\u201d</p><p>TJ silently agreed that Cyrus indeed <i>did</i>\n look great, what with his handsome Peter Pan costume. It fit him \nperfect; the clothing and the role. Through all their talks, TJ learned \nthat Cyrus never wanted to grow up, that he always wanted to fly, and \nthat he <i>definitely</i> had a crush on Peter Pan when he was a little kid.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d TJ smirked, opening the door and stepping aside, \u201cLadies first,\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he said playfully, shoving him in the arm and gracefully bouncing down the steps from his house.</p><hr><p>The\n two took off for Andi\u2019s house, which was decked out with giant \ninflatable ghosts, beautifully carved pumpkins, and lights surrounding \nAndi Shack. It looked breathtakingly spooky, according to Cyrus.</p><p>The moment they entered the door, the volume of the music hit them like a brick wall because <i>man</i>\n was it loud. And Cyrus would have complained were it not for them \nplaying the Monster Mash, arguably the best Halloween song ever written.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, you made it!\u201d Andi shouted across the room, squeezing between a vampire and a fairy to make her way over to her friend.</p><p>\u201cTJ\n convinced me to come,\u201d he said with a shrug, looking over his shoulder \nto see TJ gently bopping his head along to the rhythm. Turning back to \nAndi, he said \u201cWhen\u2019s the costume contest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little later. I \nthink we\u2019re going to do bobbing for apples in a few minutes, but \notherwise you can just hang out, dance a little, and grab something to \neat,\u201d she offered, adjusting her whiskers. Her makeup looked incredible,\n thanks to Bex and her godly makeup skills.</p><p>\u201cAndi, you\u2019re gonna \nmiss the apple bobbing!\u201d Buffy drawled, grabbing the girl\u2019s hand and \ndragging her away. Andi mustered a garbled \u201csee ya!\u201d to Cyrus and TJ, \nand was then swept away in a cloud of bodies.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d TJ asked, nodding his head in the direction of the vortex that took Andi and Buffy.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApple bobbing, duh,\u201d he stated as if obvious, \u201cgive it a go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll mess up this,\u201d he gestured vaguely to his costume, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cPlease, you look good all the time,\u201d TJ replied, his face burning a crimson red. That sounded a little <i>too</i> flirty. Well, he <i>meant</i> it to be flirty, but those were things he usually said in his head, and not out loud.</p><p>But\n Cyrus merely smiled wider, his brows raising slightly. \u201cSoftie,\u201d he \ngiggled, grabbing his hand and dragging them to the kitchen, \u201cI\u2019m going \nbobbing for apples and, dammit, I\u2019m gonna look good doing it,\u201d</p><p><i>Damn right you are,</i> TJ thought to himself, as Cyrus released his hand and wandered over to a free bucket.</p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>\u201cListen\n up!\u201d Bex shouted over the noise, \u201cyou have one minute to get as many \napples as you can from the water into the green bucket. You cannot use \nyour hands or any clothing as help,\u201d she added, raising her brows at \nAndi, who merely smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cYou got this, Underdog,\u201d TJ clapped him on the back, stepping back to watch.</p><p>\u201cOn your marks, get set, go!\u201d Bex shouted, starting the timer and wincing as the other children cheered for their friends.</p><p>\u201cGo Cyrus!\u201d TJ yelled as loud as he could. He wasn\u2019t able to see very much of the competition, but he cheered nonetheless.</p><p>Cyrus,\n on the other hand, was regretting his choices. Not only did he not like\n the absurd amount of noise, but he was already coughing up water ten \nseconds into the competition. He tried to grip the apples, but they kept\n slipping, and he would get more and more frustrated. When Bex called \ntime, he immediately reached for the towel to dry his face and hair off.\n He\u2019d only managed to get one apple out of the bucket.</p><p>\u201cAnd the \nwinner is\u2026Evan, with 6 apples!\u201d Bex announced cheerily, \u201cthank you \nguys for playing, we\u2019ll be having another round later. Now go have fun!\u201d\n She grabbed a towel from the cupboard and began to clean up all of the \nwater that had spilled.</p><p>\u201cNice job,\u201d Cyrus congratulated Evan, \n\u201calthough, you kinda ruined your goth makeup,\u201d he giggled. Evan had gone\n as one of the band members from KISS, and the black paint was bleeding.</p><p>\u201cEh, worth it,\u201d he shrugged, grabbing a paper towel to try and dab off the excess water, \u201cnice job to you too,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n please,\u201d Cyrus scoffed, adjusting his hat, \u201cthat was pitiful and you \nknow it.\u201d He playfully punched the other boys arm, a cascade of laughter\n following.</p><p>TJ sat back and watched, torn between yelling \nsomething or running off. Unfortunately, Halloween magic had cemented \nhis feet into the wooden floor. A lump rose in his throat and he did his\n best to choke it back. But he couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous from \nseeing Cyrus with Evan. And it <i>killed</i> him that he knew that Evan was gay.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d\n Evan cleared his throat, his eyes darting down to Cyrus\u2019 shoes and \ntrailing all the way back up, \u201cI was wondering if you wanted to, maybe, \ncatch a movie this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019d be great! TJ actually really wanted to see this movie, some superhero one, and he\u2019d love to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d\n the other boy cut in, \u201cI was thinking it could just be me and you,\u201d he \nmurmured, smiling sheepishly. For a split second, his gaze met TJ\u2019s, \nbefore TJ stormed away, holding his breath so he didn\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026like a <i>date</i>?\u201d\n Cyrus questioned, toying nervously with the hem of his shirt. Since \nwhen was Evan gay? Or bi? Or\u2026not straight? Was he even asking him out \non a date? Or was it just a \u2018hang\u2019?</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he admitted, tossing his blonde locks back, \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know if you even <i>like</i> boys but, I figured I\u2019d shoot my shot,\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\n offered him a sympathetic smile. \u201cEvan, I\u2019m really flattered,\u201d he \nstarted, and felt his stomach knot seeing the other boy\u2019s face fall \nslightly, \u201cand for the record, I <i>do </i>like guys, but I just, I don\u2019t feel the same,\u201d he admitted, feeling almost guilty, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Evan replied albeit shakily, \u201cat least you\u2019re not leaving me on. And knowing that you like boys makes things <i>so</i> much clearer,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, grabbing an apple from the bucket and taking a bite.<br></p><p>\u201cYou and Kippen,\u201d he stated simply, and Cyrus nearly choked.</p><p>\u201c<i>What</i>?\u201d he coughed, tears budding at the corner of his eyes from trying to clear his throat.<br></p><p>\u201cAre\n you blind? He\u2019s, like, really into you. And I wasn\u2019t sure if you were \ninto guys, so I just assumed you were good friends. But you like him, \ndon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Cyrus opened his mouth to reply, turning his head\n to see where TJ was last, but he wasn\u2019t there, \u201cneed to go find TJ,\u201d he\n said instead, offering a quick smile before he slid out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGo\n get your man!\u201d he heard Evan call from the kitchen. Shaking his head, \nhe squeezed through the throng of middle schoolers, but couldn\u2019t find TJ\n anywhere. Deciding that he had had enough of all the noise, he grabbed a\n few brownies and a soda, and headed up the stairs.</p><hr><p>By\n the time he reached the top, the music was already significantly \nsofter, and he could finally exhale a breath he didn\u2019t know he was \nholding. Figuring Andi wouldn\u2019t be upset if he hung out in her room, he \npushed open the door and nearly dropped his soda on the ground when he \nsaw TJ in there.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d he sputtered, placing his snacks on Andi\u2019s dresser, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you all night! Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\n don\u2019t you just go back and hang out with your boyfriend,\u201d he spat out, \nkicking his shoes off and crossing his legs on her bed.</p><p>\u201cMy-<i>what</i> are you talking about?\u201d Shutting the door, Cyrus approached the other boy, sitting a few feet away from him on the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me,\u201d he hissed, \u201cyou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-<i>Evan</i>? Are you talking about him?\u201d he asked incredulously, his brows shooting up to his hairline.</p><p>\u201cHe\n was totally flirting with you, Cyrus! Did you not notice?\u201d The taller \nboy\u2019s voice shrunk as he spoke, failing to uphold his bravado tone.</p><p>\u201cI mean, after he asked me on a date, I kind of figured,\u201d he chuckled, but stopped on behalf of seeing TJ\u2019s frown deepen.</p><p>\u201cJust\n go back to him. Have fun on your date.\u201d He swiftly turned around to \nface the wall, digging his teeth harshly into his lower lip.</p><p>Now it was Cyrus\u2019 turn to frown. \u201cI don\u2019t like Evan. I mean, I don\u2019t <i>hate</i> him, but I don\u2019t like him more than a friend,\u201d</p><p>TJ, unconvinced merely said \u201cSeemed like you did when you were laughing it up,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\n was a self-deprecating joke about my apple bobbing abilities, Teej,\u201d \nCyrus informed him, \u201cbesides, why do you even care so much? You\u2019re \nacting weird,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not,\u201d he retorted lamely, although he knew it was true. He <i>knew</i> why he was acting up, why he had stormed out of the kitchen, and why he was now on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cOh,\n really?\u201d Cyrus scoffed, a hint of sass creeping its way into his voice,\n \u201cthen why don\u2019t you explain to me why you\u2019re getting so worked up over \nsome <i>guy</i> asking me out on a date, which, might I remind you, I turned down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like you okay? Happy now?\u201d TJ spat out, turning to face Cyrus. One blink and all the tears would fall.</p><p>What\n followed was a moment of silence, save for the thumping music \ndownstairs. TJ thought he was going to faint or throw up or both. Cyrus \njust sat there, stunned. After a few moments, he broke out into a small \nfit of laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is it just <i>so</i> funny that I like you? Is it just that pathetic?\u201d TJ huffed, hugging a pillow to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo! Just\u2026Evan was right. You <i>do</i> like me,\u201d he chuckled, and TJ\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cHow would he even know that? I never told him about that,\u201d he muttered, his hands squeezing the pillow.</p><p>\u201cHe\n told me that he saw the way you looked at me. And I basically told him \n\u2018yeah, right\u2019 but\u2026I guess he was right,\u201d Cyrus admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd \nthis is the part of the movie where you say you don\u2019t feel the same and I\n just nod and dissolve into tears,\u201d TJ said shakily, feeling his eyes \nsting harshly from the tears forming.</p><p>\u201cActually this is the part where I tell you that I like you too,\u201d he whispered, his cheeks turning an embarrassing shade of red.</p><p>Before\n TJ could comprehend what Cyrus said, the shorter boy was already \nleaning in and connecting their lips. It was soft and gentle, and TJ \ncouldn\u2019t help but smile into it, a few loose tears slipping down his \nface.</p><p>Unfortunately, humans need air to survive, so they had to pull away to take in air. Both boys were giggling, blushing messes.</p><p>\u201c<i>Now</i> will you stop acting weird?\u201d Cyrus whispered against the other boy\u2019s lips, stealing a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cMm, only if I can kiss you again,\u201d TJ smirked, leaning in and touching their noses together.</p><p>\u201cI supposed tha-\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was cut off by Andi and Buffy pushing open the door, their hands entangled and Buffy\u2019s lips on Andi\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-Cyrus?\u201d Andi gawked, her eyes widening, \u201cwhat the heck are you doing in here? With TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d he countered, smirking when he saw both girls blush madly.</p><p>\u201cFair\n point. I wanted to say that you missed the costume contest, and I was \nlooking for you, and then Buffy tagged along and we were looking for you\n and then\u2026yeah,\u201d she explained hurriedly, \u201csorry you missed it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said with a smile, nuzzling his head against TJ\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou were the best looking out there, Underdog,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d Buffy countered playfully, pecking Andi\u2019s cheek quickly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gay,\u201d TJ replied childishly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all gay, TJ,\u201d</p><p>tag list:<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7R6p_iU9G8Gh8chz1LUkOg\">@shortstackofpeaches || </a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWsIkR1GJgSJuWbP-DN9ydA\">@seanna313</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB_fjwbYnt6KH-iEEVWn8ig\">@geekingbeautytx</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx3fTvftLAxW_PMMErDl_UA\">@heavenlybyers ||</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr1BeThlMP6lSNdCv9_u98w\">@ghostswasp</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq4Fz3LkzWjZC-KqvwLI2IQ\">@wlwandimack</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlcQ2RsNl23FLSXFuHW7LHA\">@giocondasstuff</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjInWsj0ClAwVBAeG3vRcVw\">@lemonboytyrus</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNwMw7enpLkLc8PJbIgqIpA\">@adorejrizzle</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqsacC6O0CwDxqCVXhKqKMg\">@swingsetboys</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5HZenndZxervK_R1eUWPgA\">@ifellintotyrushell</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlmDXY_IPGUhgMI0icEk5Fw\">@idk-dude-17</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md3vq8Jj9kFqSljYsARejoQ\">@rbf-lesbian</a> ||\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miY4DTLwRG38LWUEXGrwqQQ\">@marianara-sauce</a> || <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mweSXXIeqHwnjzlxWq9XUDw\">@kaptainjinxz</a> || @<a href=\"http://alex-poster-pizz.tumblr.com\">alex-poster-pizz</a></p>",
                "content": "<p>((oh totally! i needed a break from school anyways, lol, so here we go!))</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Because if you don&rsquo;t go, how are you going to survive a college party when the time comes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,\n do I look like the kind of person that&rsquo;s going to be attending college \nparties?&rdquo; Cyrus retorted, crossing his arms and pretending to look \nupset.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna regret it,&rdquo; TJ insisted using his &lsquo;I Know \nBetter&rsquo; voice. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;ll be fun. There&rsquo;s gonna be candy and \ndancing and&hellip;a costume contest!&rdquo;</p><p>The shorter boy pretended to \nthink it over, his lips curling into a smile. &ldquo;Alright, I suppose I&rsquo;ll \ngo,&rdquo; he sighed playfully, &ldquo;I <i>will</i> be winning the contest after all, I look great,&rdquo;</p><p>TJ silently agreed that Cyrus indeed <i>did</i>\n look great, what with his handsome Peter Pan costume. It fit him \nperfect; the clothing and the role. Through all their talks, TJ learned \nthat Cyrus never wanted to grow up, that he always wanted to fly, and \nthat he <i>definitely</i> had a crush on Peter Pan when he was a little kid.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; TJ smirked, opening the door and stepping aside, &ldquo;Ladies first,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; he said playfully, shoving him in the arm and gracefully bouncing down the steps from his house.</p><hr /><p>The\n two took off for Andi&rsquo;s house, which was decked out with giant \ninflatable ghosts, beautifully carved pumpkins, and lights surrounding \nAndi Shack. It looked breathtakingly spooky, according to Cyrus.</p><p>The moment they entered the door, the volume of the music hit them like a brick wall because <i>man</i>\n was it loud. And Cyrus would have complained were it not for them \nplaying the Monster Mash, arguably the best Halloween song ever written.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, you made it!&rdquo; Andi shouted across the room, squeezing between a vampire and a fairy to make her way over to her friend.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ\n convinced me to come,&rdquo; he said with a shrug, looking over his shoulder \nto see TJ gently bopping his head along to the rhythm. Turning back to \nAndi, he said &ldquo;When&rsquo;s the costume contest?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little later. I \nthink we&rsquo;re going to do bobbing for apples in a few minutes, but \notherwise you can just hang out, dance a little, and grab something to \neat,&rdquo; she offered, adjusting her whiskers. Her makeup looked incredible,\n thanks to Bex and her godly makeup skills.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi, you&rsquo;re gonna \nmiss the apple bobbing!&rdquo; Buffy drawled, grabbing the girl&rsquo;s hand and \ndragging her away. Andi mustered a garbled &ldquo;see ya!&rdquo; to Cyrus and TJ, \nand was then swept away in a cloud of bodies.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; TJ asked, nodding his head in the direction of the vortex that took Andi and Buffy.</p><p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apple bobbing, duh,&rdquo; he stated as if obvious, &ldquo;give it a go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll mess up this,&rdquo; he gestured vaguely to his costume, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, you look good all the time,&rdquo; TJ replied, his face burning a crimson red. That sounded a little <i>too</i> flirty. Well, he <i>meant</i> it to be flirty, but those were things he usually said in his head, and not out loud.</p><p>But\n Cyrus merely smiled wider, his brows raising slightly. &ldquo;Softie,&rdquo; he \ngiggled, grabbing his hand and dragging them to the kitchen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going \nbobbing for apples and, dammit, I&rsquo;m gonna look good doing it,&rdquo;</p><p><i>Damn right you are,</i> TJ thought to himself, as Cyrus released his hand and wandered over to a free bucket.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Listen\n up!&rdquo; Bex shouted over the noise, &ldquo;you have one minute to get as many \napples as you can from the water into the green bucket. You cannot use \nyour hands or any clothing as help,&rdquo; she added, raising her brows at \nAndi, who merely smiled sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;You got this, Underdog,&rdquo; TJ clapped him on the back, stepping back to watch.</p><p>&ldquo;On your marks, get set, go!&rdquo; Bex shouted, starting the timer and wincing as the other children cheered for their friends.</p><p>&ldquo;Go Cyrus!&rdquo; TJ yelled as loud as he could. He wasn&rsquo;t able to see very much of the competition, but he cheered nonetheless.</p><p>Cyrus,\n on the other hand, was regretting his choices. Not only did he not like\n the absurd amount of noise, but he was already coughing up water ten \nseconds into the competition. He tried to grip the apples, but they kept\n slipping, and he would get more and more frustrated. When Bex called \ntime, he immediately reached for the towel to dry his face and hair off.\n He&rsquo;d only managed to get one apple out of the bucket.</p><p>&ldquo;And the \nwinner is&hellip;Evan, with 6 apples!&rdquo; Bex announced cheerily, &ldquo;thank you \nguys for playing, we&rsquo;ll be having another round later. Now go have fun!&rdquo;\n She grabbed a towel from the cupboard and began to clean up all of the \nwater that had spilled.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice job,&rdquo; Cyrus congratulated Evan, \n&ldquo;although, you kinda ruined your goth makeup,&rdquo; he giggled. Evan had gone\n as one of the band members from KISS, and the black paint was bleeding.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, worth it,&rdquo; he shrugged, grabbing a paper towel to try and dab off the excess water, &ldquo;nice job to you too,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n please,&rdquo; Cyrus scoffed, adjusting his hat, &ldquo;that was pitiful and you \nknow it.&rdquo; He playfully punched the other boys arm, a cascade of laughter\n following.</p><p>TJ sat back and watched, torn between yelling \nsomething or running off. Unfortunately, Halloween magic had cemented \nhis feet into the wooden floor. A lump rose in his throat and he did his\n best to choke it back. But he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel jealous from \nseeing Cyrus with Evan. And it <i>killed</i> him that he knew that Evan was gay.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo;\n Evan cleared his throat, his eyes darting down to Cyrus&rsquo; shoes and \ntrailing all the way back up, &ldquo;I was wondering if you wanted to, maybe, \ncatch a movie this weekend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;d be great! TJ actually really wanted to see this movie, some superhero one, and he&rsquo;d love to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo;\n the other boy cut in, &ldquo;I was thinking it could just be me and you,&rdquo; he \nmurmured, smiling sheepishly. For a split second, his gaze met TJ&rsquo;s, \nbefore TJ stormed away, holding his breath so he didn&rsquo;t cry.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean&hellip;like a <i>date</i>?&rdquo;\n Cyrus questioned, toying nervously with the hem of his shirt. Since \nwhen was Evan gay? Or bi? Or&hellip;not straight? Was he even asking him out \non a date? Or was it just a &lsquo;hang&rsquo;?</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yeah,&rdquo; he admitted, tossing his blonde locks back, &ldquo;I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you even <i>like</i> boys but, I figured I&rsquo;d shoot my shot,&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus\n offered him a sympathetic smile. &ldquo;Evan, I&rsquo;m really flattered,&rdquo; he \nstarted, and felt his stomach knot seeing the other boy&rsquo;s face fall \nslightly, &ldquo;and for the record, I <i>do </i>like guys, but I just, I don&rsquo;t feel the same,&rdquo; he admitted, feeling almost guilty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Evan replied albeit shakily, &ldquo;at least you&rsquo;re not leaving me on. And knowing that you like boys makes things <i>so</i> much clearer,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, grabbing an apple from the bucket and taking a bite.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You and Kippen,&rdquo; he stated simply, and Cyrus nearly choked.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>?&rdquo; he coughed, tears budding at the corner of his eyes from trying to clear his throat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are\n you blind? He&rsquo;s, like, really into you. And I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you were \ninto guys, so I just assumed you were good friends. But you like him, \ndon&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-&rdquo; Cyrus opened his mouth to reply, turning his head\n to see where TJ was last, but he wasn&rsquo;t there, &ldquo;need to go find TJ,&rdquo; he\n said instead, offering a quick smile before he slid out of the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Go\n get your man!&rdquo; he heard Evan call from the kitchen.

Through all their talks, TJ learned \nthat Cyrus never wanted to grow up, that he always wanted to fly, and \nthat he <i>definitely</i> had a crush on Peter Pan when he was a little kid.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; TJ smirked, opening the door and stepping aside, &ldquo;Ladies first,&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; he said playfully, shoving him in the arm and gracefully bouncing down the steps from his house.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The\n two took off for Andi&rsquo;s house, which was decked out with giant \ninflatable ghosts, beautifully carved pumpkins, and lights surrounding \nAndi Shack. It looked breathtakingly spooky, according to Cyrus.</p>\n<p>The moment they entered the door, the volume of the music hit them like a brick wall because <i>man</i>\n was it loud. And Cyrus would have complained were it not for them \nplaying the Monster Mash, arguably the best Halloween song ever written.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cyrus, you made it!&rdquo; Andi shouted across the room, squeezing between a vampire and a fairy to make her way over to her friend.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;TJ\n convinced me to come,&rdquo; he said with a shrug, looking over his shoulder \nto see TJ gently bopping his head along to the rhythm. Turning back to \nAndi, he said &ldquo;When&rsquo;s the costume contest?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A little later. I \nthink we&rsquo;re going to do bobbing for apples in a few minutes, but \notherwise you can just hang out, dance a little, and grab something to \neat,&rdquo; she offered, adjusting her whiskers. Her makeup looked incredible,\n thanks to Bex and her godly makeup skills.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Andi, you&rsquo;re gonna \nmiss the apple bobbing!&rdquo; Buffy drawled, grabbing the girl&rsquo;s hand and \ndragging her away. Andi mustered a garbled &ldquo;see ya!&rdquo; to Cyrus and TJ, \nand was then swept away in a cloud of bodies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; TJ asked, nodding his head in the direction of the vortex that took Andi and Buffy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Apple bobbing, duh,&rdquo; he stated as if obvious, &ldquo;give it a go?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll mess up this,&rdquo; he gestured vaguely to his costume, grinning from ear to ear.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Please, you look good all the time,&rdquo; TJ replied, his face burning a crimson red. That sounded a little <i>too</i> flirty. Well, he <i>meant</i> it to be flirty, but those were things he usually said in his head, and not out loud.</p>\n<p>But\n Cyrus merely smiled wider, his brows raising slightly. &ldquo;Softie,&rdquo; he \ngiggled, grabbing his hand and dragging them to the kitchen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going \nbobbing for apples and, dammit, I&rsquo;m gonna look good doing it,&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i>Damn right you are,</i> TJ thought to himself, as Cyrus released his hand and wandered over to a free bucket.</p>\n</p>",
