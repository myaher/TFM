He was steadily growing closer to Dan ever since their cupcake date. Phil didn\u2019t refer to it as a date since he didn\u2019t want to freak Dan out. While his friendship was thriving, Phil still had to face his worst enemy every day: the school counselor.</p><p>Every counseling period was just another opportunity that being gay isn&rsquo;t wrong with Mr. Neil, the counselor. In fact, he became Phil\u2019s enemy the first time he opened his mouth to state, \u201cYour father told me about your problem and rest assured, I can fix it! I have turned many homosexuals back into heterosexuals very easily!\u201d</p><p>Phil couldn\u2019t decide whether it was how confident Mr. Neil was or how he spoke about changing who Phil was with a giant ass smile but whatever it was, it caused Phil to go off. He yelled on and on about how being gay or loving somebody who was not of the opposite gender wasn\u2019t sinful and couldn\u2019t give more of a crap if people from nearby classrooms overheard. He expected the counselor to sit and patiently listen like any normal counselor would but boy was he wrong.</p><p>Mr. Neil, practically had fire spewing out of his ears as he listened to Phil rant. His hand was gripping the Bible on his desk so tightly, all his blood disappeared from his knuckles and shot up to his cherry colored cheeks. When Phil finished, Mr. Neil began rebutting Phil\u2019s words with his homophobic opinions. Halfway through the counselor\u2019s argument that it was \u201cAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve\u201d the bell rang and Phil bolted out of the counseling office.</p><p>The following days weren\u2019t any different and Phil was surprised that his voice wasn\u2019t already gone. Counseling was like having to deal with his dad, but at least Phil could argue back. He wanted to run away from this school as he hated Mr.Neil so much but Dan was the reason he stayed.</p><p>Phil had grown closer to Dan as a roommate and friend. Tony had only come back to his room a couple of times since the first day and Ben was always studying in the library or helping out teachers. While he and the boy with eyes as creamy as liquid fudge had initially bonded over bands, they soon discovered other common interests. Dan and Phil both loved dinosaurs and crystals and Phil love watching suspense and mystery movies as much as Dan did.</p><p>Phil wanted Dan to be his close friend at first, but now he was developing a full-on crush on his favorite brunette. He wasn\u2019t used to falling for people; he had grown to follow the \u201cno strings attached\u201d unspoken policy, hence the lack of past boyfriends. If Phil was being honest, he had wanted Dan to fall for him so he could bask in the glory of knowing there was another non-heterosexual person in this school. Yet, he now was paying too much attention to little details about Dan\u2019s beauty.</p><p>It was tough to keep up his \u201cbad boy\u201d act around someone whose giggles could turn his fingers into limp gummy worms. He had to gulp down admiration for Dan\u2019s perfect curls and he had to hide his grin when Dan stuck out his tongue during moments of intense concentration. After another frustrating period of \u201ccounseling\u201d, Phil was relieved to find Dan in his room.</p><p>\u201cHey Dan, how was class?\u201d Phil dropped his backpack on the floor and sat down next to Dan. Dan looked stressed with the frown pulled taut across his face.</p><p>\u201cUm, can I talk to you about something?\u201d Dan bashfully asked, tucking a curl behind his ear, causing Phil\u2019s heart to flutter.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Phil tried to seem as light-hearted as possible as he wanted Dan to feel comfortable around him.</p><p>\u201cI didn&rsquo;t know who else to come to but\u2026 I think I might be bisexual? I\u2019ve always really liked boys but I never really entertained the possibility of not being straight because everybody in my life was homophobic until I met you,\u201d Dan refused to make eye contact, obviously not used to talking about heavy subjects like this. \u201cYou just seemed so confident about being gay in such a close-minded environment I began to consider the idea of being bisexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really proud of you Dan. It takes a lot of bravery to admit something this personal. Thank you so much for telling me,\u201d Phil strangled down his internal shouts of victory and placed a comforting hand on Dan\u2019s back. Dan finally raised his head to meet Phil\u2019s eyes, offering a grateful smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Phil had no clue why his heart was running laps in his chest when he asked. He had initiated many kisses with boys before but here he was, terrified to kiss bi-curious Dan Howell. Maybe it was because he was scared that Dan would rat him out to the entire school or that this one simple action would wreck his friendship with Dan. Dan nodded and Phil chose to ignore all his thoughts and follow his instincts, even if his instincts resulted in negative outcomes more than half of the time.</p><p>The moment his lips touched Dan\u2019s, Phil knew this kiss was special. Unlike all the rushed, meaningless and heated lip locks Phil shared with boys in his hometown, this kiss was full of sweet suspense and cautious care. He grew worried when Dan didn\u2019t reciprocate but barely held in a gasp when Dan parted his lips to welcome another kiss. Soon, Phil had his hand on the back of Dan\u2019s neck and Dan\u2019s hands were on Phil\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Shockingly, Phil was the first to break the growing heat between their heads as his lungs were three seconds away from collapsing.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Dan\u2019s face was redder than the sunset.</p><p>\u201cHow was that?\u201d Phil bit his bottom lip, pressing down his smile. Usually, he was drained after kissing guys but this time he felt giddy as if he had consumed a whole bag of gummy worms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kissed girls before but kissing boys is so much more intense! Or maybe you\u2019re just really good with your mouth,\u201d Dan laughed and the birds stopped chirping to listen to the sound of his laughter. How was this boy so ridiculously gorgeous?</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think you\u2019re bisexual now?\u201d Phil raised an eyebrow and just as Dan began to lean in, Ben opened the door. The brunette bolted out of Phil\u2019s room and through the bathroom to greet his unintentionally intrusive roommate. Phil texted Dan to sneak into his room at night and 30 minutes after lights out, the bathroom door on Phil\u2019s side slowly opened. Dan carefully shut it behind him and grinned at Phil, whose face was glowing a faint orange due to the flashlight on his phone.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I had to make sure Ben was asleep before I could come. He was snoring and fast asleep when I checked,\u201d Dan barely finished his sentence when Phil pushed him back on the bed and kissed his pink cotton candy lips. Needless to say, both of the boys were tired the next morning from staying up so late.</p><p>The fact that Ben was still oblivious to Dan and Phil being a couple was hilarious because they spent almost every night together. If Ben found out, both of the boys would be toast. Being in a relationship, even if it was a hidden one, with Dan made Phil the most overjoyed person in the universe. He began skipping counseling to prepare gifts for Dan. They completed their homework together and behaved in class and in the cafeteria even if in the dorms, the good Christian boy&rsquo;s everybody knew no longer existed.</p><p>Phil hung out with his group of tough friends while Dan socialized with the open-minded nerds. Phil only kept up his rebellious act publically and showed his soft side to Dan. He would laugh at Dan\u2019s horrible jokes and cuddle with his boyfriend while they listened to music through shared earbuds. Phil began to wear glasses more often and even if they made him look dorky, it was worth seeing Dan gush over how cute his boyfriend looked in glasses.</p><p>For their one month anniversary, Phil got a cupcake from the bakery they met at for their first date. He lit a candle with the big number one and surprised Dan at night. Dan had to wear a hoodie during one of the hottest and last days of fall to cover up the hickies Phil left on his neck. Once, Phil even let Dan paint his toenails.</p><p>Everything was perfect until the Winter Ball began drawing closer and closer. The Winter Ball was the school dance before the Winter Intersession and as the school tradition started, the girls were the ones to ask out the boys. Everyone who attended the school was invited and nearly all the students went to (only the ones who left early for vacation didn\u2019t show up). Phil couldn\u2019t care less since A) no girl would ever have the guts to ask him out and B) he wouldn\u2019t be dancing with any girls and dancing with Dan would be disastrous.</p><p>Phil devised a simple plan for him and Dan skipping the dance: they could both fake being extremely ill so they could have their own Winter Ball in Phil\u2019s room. Unfortunately, Dan had other planes.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear? Dan got asked out to the Winter\u2019s Ball by Bree! He said yes!\u201d Ben informed Phil, who was waiting for Dan to come back to the dorms.</p><p>\u201cBree who? What? How?\u201d Phil sputtered, nearly falling off the bed in shock. He had never heard Dan mention a girl named Bree before.</p><p>\u201cBree as in Brianna Salcov! She asked him today right after school since she\u2019s in the same 7th-period class as Dan! Bree gave him flowers and Dan said yes without hesitating! They are the perfect couple!\u201d Ben seemed so excited and Phil repressed the urge to punch him in the face. \u201cWell, I better get going! I have to help the teachers with Winter Ball planning!\u201d</p><p>Only a few minutes after Ben left, Dan finally came back and Phil angrily stood up, crossing his arms, \u201cWhat the hell Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you heard,\u201d Dan sighed tiredly as if this was the thousandth time Phil had mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I heard from Ben, which is extremely mortifying. Why did you say yes?\u201d Phil couldn\u2019t help but let his dismay show in his voice. Dan threaded his fingers through his curls in a tired manner and sighed again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do? Say no and have people speculate about my sexuality? Boys aren&rsquo;t supposed to turn girls down,e even if he doesn\u2019t like her! We\u2019re young! Love doesn\u2019t mean anything to us!\u201d Dan argued, his fists clenching as his frustration grew.</p><p>\u201cOh, so we weren\u2019t in love? So nothing we did matter to you?\u201d It was becoming harder to force down the tears that were a few breaths away from falling out of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt meant something, but you knew we never could have lasted. Our relationship was a mistake. I know you\u2019re tired of hiding all the time and it was our only option. With Bree, I can secure my social status!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just using Bree for your personal needs? And are you even considering her feelings? She probably has a crush on you and now she thinks you like her back even though you don\u2019t!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was gradually increasing in volume but he couldn\u2019t control his emotions anymore.</p><p>\u201cNo! I do like her! Just not as much as she probably likes me!\u201d Dan threw his arms up impatiently as if he had made the situation crystal clear.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. I see how it is. Well, have fun with your new girlfriend,\u201d Phil spat before storming into his room, slamming the bathroom door on his side. He barely lasted a minute after leaving Dan\u2019s room before he started to sob. For once in his life, he found somebody who meant the world to him but he didn\u2019t mean a single thing to Dan. As Phil cried into a pillow, all the precious memories made with Dan replayed in his head. So this is what it felt like to have your heart destroyed.</p><p><i>read chapter 3, <a href=\"https://luckysam78.tumblr.com/post/178579406681/mistakes\" target=\"_blank\">the final chapter, here</a></i></p>",

He was steadily growing closer to Dan ever since their cupcake date. Phil didn\u2019t refer to it as a date since he didn\u2019t want to freak Dan out. While his friendship was thriving, Phil still had to face his worst enemy every day: the school counselor.</p><p>Every counseling period was just another opportunity that being gay isn\u2019t wrong with Mr. Neil, the counselor. In fact, he became Phil\u2019s enemy the first time he opened his mouth to state, \u201cYour father told me about your problem and rest assured, I can fix it! I have turned many homosexuals back into heterosexuals very easily!\u201d</p><p>Phil couldn\u2019t decide whether it was how confident Mr. Neil was or how he spoke about changing who Phil was with a giant ass smile but whatever it was, it caused Phil to go off. He yelled on and on about how being gay or loving somebody who was not of the opposite gender wasn\u2019t sinful and couldn\u2019t give more of a crap if people from nearby classrooms overheard. He expected the counselor to sit and patiently listen like any normal counselor would but boy was he wrong.</p><p>Mr. Neil, practically had fire spewing out of his ears as he listened to Phil rant. His hand was gripping the Bible on his desk so tightly, all his blood disappeared from his knuckles and shot up to his cherry colored cheeks. When Phil finished, Mr. Neil began rebutting Phil\u2019s words with his homophobic opinions. Halfway through the counselor\u2019s argument that it was \u201cAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve\u201d the bell rang and Phil bolted out of the counseling office.</p><p>The following days weren\u2019t any different and Phil was surprised that his voice wasn\u2019t already gone. Counseling was like having to deal with his dad, but at least Phil could argue back. He wanted to run away from this school as he hated Mr.Neil so much but Dan was the reason he stayed.</p><p>Phil had grown closer to Dan as a roommate and friend. Tony had only come back to his room a couple of times since the first day and Ben was always studying in the library or helping out teachers. While he and the boy with eyes as creamy as liquid fudge had initially bonded over bands, they soon discovered other common interests. Dan and Phil both loved dinosaurs and crystals and Phil love watching suspense and mystery movies as much as Dan did.</p><p>Phil wanted Dan to be his close friend at first, but now he was developing a full-on crush on his favorite brunette. He wasn\u2019t used to falling for people; he had grown to follow the \u201cno strings attached\u201d unspoken policy, hence the lack of past boyfriends. If Phil was being honest, he had wanted Dan to fall for him so he could bask in the glory of knowing there was another non-heterosexual person in this school. Yet, he now was paying too much attention to little details about Dan\u2019s beauty.</p><p>It was tough to keep up his \u201cbad boy\u201d act around someone whose giggles could turn his fingers into limp gummy worms. He had to gulp down admiration for Dan\u2019s perfect curls and he had to hide his grin when Dan stuck out his tongue during moments of intense concentration. After another frustrating period of \u201ccounseling\u201d, Phil was relieved to find Dan in his room.</p><p>\u201cHey Dan, how was class?\u201d Phil dropped his backpack on the floor and sat down next to Dan. Dan looked stressed with the frown pulled taut across his face.</p><p>\u201cUm, can I talk to you about something?\u201d Dan bashfully asked, tucking a curl behind his ear, causing Phil\u2019s heart to flutter.</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d Phil tried to seem as light-hearted as possible as he wanted Dan to feel comfortable around him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know who else to come to but\u2026 I think I might be bisexual? I\u2019ve always really liked boys but I never really entertained the possibility of not being straight because everybody in my life was homophobic until I met you,\u201d Dan refused to make eye contact, obviously not used to talking about heavy subjects like this. \u201cYou just seemed so confident about being gay in such a close-minded environment I began to consider the idea of being bisexual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really proud of you Dan. It takes a lot of bravery to admit something this personal. Thank you so much for telling me,\u201d Phil strangled down his internal shouts of victory and placed a comforting hand on Dan\u2019s back. Dan finally raised his head to meet Phil\u2019s eyes, offering a grateful smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Phil had no clue why his heart was running laps in his chest when he asked. He had initiated many kisses with boys before but here he was, terrified to kiss bi-curious Dan Howell. Maybe it was because he was scared that Dan would rat him out to the entire school or that this one simple action would wreck his friendship with Dan. Dan nodded and Phil chose to ignore all his thoughts and follow his instincts, even if his instincts resulted in negative outcomes more than half of the time.</p><p>The moment his lips touched Dan\u2019s, Phil knew this kiss was special. Unlike all the rushed, meaningless and heated lip locks Phil shared with boys in his hometown, this kiss was full of sweet suspense and cautious care. He grew worried when Dan didn\u2019t reciprocate but barely held in a gasp when Dan parted his lips to welcome another kiss. Soon, Phil had his hand on the back of Dan\u2019s neck and Dan\u2019s hands were on Phil\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Shockingly, Phil was the first to break the growing heat between their heads as his lungs were three seconds away from collapsing.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Dan\u2019s face was redder than the sunset.</p><p>\u201cHow was that?\u201d Phil bit his bottom lip, pressing down his smile. Usually, he was drained after kissing guys but this time he felt giddy as if he had consumed a whole bag of gummy worms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kissed girls before but kissing boys is so much more intense! Or maybe you\u2019re just really good with your mouth,\u201d Dan laughed and the birds stopped chirping to listen to the sound of his laughter. How was this boy so ridiculously gorgeous?</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think you\u2019re bisexual now?\u201d Phil raised an eyebrow and just as Dan began to lean in, Ben opened the door. The brunette bolted out of Phil\u2019s room and through the bathroom to greet his unintentionally intrusive roommate. Phil texted Dan to sneak into his room at night and 30 minutes after lights out, the bathroom door on Phil\u2019s side slowly opened. Dan carefully shut it behind him and grinned at Phil, whose face was glowing a faint orange due to the flashlight on his phone.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I had to make sure Ben was asleep before I could come. He was snoring and fast asleep when I checked,\u201d Dan barely finished his sentence when Phil pushed him back on the bed and kissed his pink cotton candy lips. Needless to say, both of the boys were tired the next morning from staying up so late.</p><p>The fact that Ben was still oblivious to Dan and Phil being a couple was hilarious because they spent almost every night together.

It takes a lot of bravery to admit something this personal. Thank you so much for telling me,\u201d Phil strangled down his internal shouts of victory and placed a comforting hand on Dan\u2019s back. Dan finally raised his head to meet Phil\u2019s eyes, offering a grateful smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I show you something?\u201d Phil had no clue why his heart was running laps in his chest when he asked. He had initiated many kisses with boys before but here he was, terrified to kiss bi-curious Dan Howell. Maybe it was because he was scared that Dan would rat him out to the entire school or that this one simple action would wreck his friendship with Dan. Dan nodded and Phil chose to ignore all his thoughts and follow his instincts, even if his instincts resulted in negative outcomes more than half of the time.</p><p>The moment his lips touched Dan\u2019s, Phil knew this kiss was special. Unlike all the rushed, meaningless and heated lip locks Phil shared with boys in his hometown, this kiss was full of sweet suspense and cautious care. He grew worried when Dan didn\u2019t reciprocate but barely held in a gasp when Dan parted his lips to welcome another kiss. Soon, Phil had his hand on the back of Dan\u2019s neck and Dan\u2019s hands were on Phil\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Shockingly, Phil was the first to break the growing heat between their heads as his lungs were three seconds away from collapsing.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Dan\u2019s face was redder than the sunset.</p><p>\u201cHow was that?\u201d Phil bit his bottom lip, pressing down his smile. Usually, he was drained after kissing guys but this time he felt giddy as if he had consumed a whole bag of gummy worms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kissed girls before but kissing boys is so much more intense! Or maybe you\u2019re just really good with your mouth,\u201d Dan laughed and the birds stopped chirping to listen to the sound of his laughter. How was this boy so ridiculously gorgeous?</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think you\u2019re bisexual now?\u201d Phil raised an eyebrow and just as Dan began to lean in, Ben opened the door. The brunette bolted out of Phil\u2019s room and through the bathroom to greet his unintentionally intrusive roommate. Phil texted Dan to sneak into his room at night and 30 minutes after lights out, the bathroom door on Phil\u2019s side slowly opened. Dan carefully shut it behind him and grinned at Phil, whose face was glowing a faint orange due to the flashlight on his phone.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I had to make sure Ben was asleep before I could come. He was snoring and fast asleep when I checked,\u201d Dan barely finished his sentence when Phil pushed him back on the bed and kissed his pink cotton candy lips. Needless to say, both of the boys were tired the next morning from staying up so late.</p><p>The fact that Ben was still oblivious to Dan and Phil being a couple was hilarious because they spent almost every night together. If Ben found out, both of the boys would be toast. Being in a relationship, even if it was a hidden one, with Dan made Phil the most overjoyed person in the universe. He began skipping counseling to prepare gifts for Dan. They completed their homework together and behaved in class and in the cafeteria even if in the dorms, the good Christian boy\u2019s everybody knew no longer existed.</p><p>Phil hung out with his group of tough friends while Dan socialized with the open-minded nerds. Phil only kept up his rebellious act publically and showed his soft side to Dan. He would laugh at Dan\u2019s horrible jokes and cuddle with his boyfriend while they listened to music through shared earbuds. Phil began to wear glasses more often and even if they made him look dorky, it was worth seeing Dan gush over how cute his boyfriend looked in glasses.</p><p>For their one month anniversary, Phil got a cupcake from the bakery they met at for their first date. He lit a candle with the big number one and surprised Dan at night. Dan had to wear a hoodie during one of the hottest and last days of fall to cover up the hickies Phil left on his neck. Once, Phil even let Dan paint his toenails.</p><p>Everything was perfect until the Winter Ball began drawing closer and closer. The Winter Ball was the school dance before the Winter Intersession and as the school tradition started, the girls were the ones to ask out the boys. Everyone who attended the school was invited and nearly all the students went to (only the ones who left early for vacation didn\u2019t show up). Phil couldn\u2019t care less since A) no girl would ever have the guts to ask him out and B) he wouldn\u2019t be dancing with any girls and dancing with Dan would be disastrous.</p><p>Phil devised a simple plan for him and Dan skipping the dance: they could both fake being extremely ill so they could have their own Winter Ball in Phil\u2019s room. Unfortunately, Dan had other planes.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear? Dan got asked out to the Winter\u2019s Ball by Bree! He said yes!\u201d Ben informed Phil, who was waiting for Dan to come back to the dorms.</p><p>\u201cBree who? What? How?\u201d Phil sputtered, nearly falling off the bed in shock. He had never heard Dan mention a girl named Bree before.</p><p>\u201cBree as in Brianna Salcov! She asked him today right after school since she\u2019s in the same 7th-period class as Dan! Bree gave him flowers and Dan said yes without hesitating! They are the perfect couple!\u201d Ben seemed so excited and Phil repressed the urge to punch him in the face. \u201cWell, I better get going! I have to help the teachers with Winter Ball planning!\u201d</p><p>Only a few minutes after Ben left, Dan finally came back and Phil angrily stood up, crossing his arms, \u201cWhat the hell Dan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you heard,\u201d Dan sighed tiredly as if this was the thousandth time Phil had mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I heard from Ben, which is extremely mortifying. Why did you say yes?\u201d Phil couldn\u2019t help but let his dismay show in his voice. Dan threaded his fingers through his curls in a tired manner and sighed again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do? Say no and have people speculate about my sexuality? Boys aren\u2019t supposed to turn girls down,e even if he doesn\u2019t like her! We\u2019re young! Love doesn\u2019t mean anything to us!\u201d Dan argued, his fists clenching as his frustration grew.</p><p>\u201cOh, so we weren\u2019t in love? So nothing we did matter to you?\u201d It was becoming harder to force down the tears that were a few breaths away from falling out of Phil\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt meant something, but you knew we never could have lasted. Our relationship was a mistake. I know you\u2019re tired of hiding all the time and it was our only option. With Bree, I can secure my social status!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just using Bree for your personal needs? And are you even considering her feelings? She probably has a crush on you and now she thinks you like her back even though you don\u2019t!\u201d Phil\u2019s voice was gradually increasing in volume but he couldn\u2019t control his emotions anymore.</p><p>\u201cNo! I do like her! Just not as much as she probably likes me!\u201d Dan threw his arms up impatiently as if he had made the situation crystal clear.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. I see how it is. Well, have fun with your new girlfriend,\u201d Phil spat before storming into his room, slamming the bathroom door on his side. He barely lasted a minute after leaving Dan\u2019s room before he started to sob. For once in his life, he found somebody who meant the world to him but he didn\u2019t mean a single thing to Dan. As Phil cried into a pillow, all the precious memories made with Dan replayed in his head. So this is what it felt like to have your heart destroyed.</p><p><i>read chapter 3, <a href=\"https://luckysam78.tumblr.com/post/178579406681/mistakes\" target=\"_blank\">the final chapter, here</a></i></p>",

He was steadily growing closer to Dan ever since their cupcake date. Phil didn&rsquo;t refer to it as a date since he didn&rsquo;t want to freak Dan out. While his friendship was thriving, Phil still had to face his worst enemy every day: the school counselor.</p><p>Every counseling period was just another opportunity that being gay isn&rsquo;t wrong with Mr. Neil, the counselor. In fact, he became Phil&rsquo;s enemy the first time he opened his mouth to state, &ldquo;Your father told me about your problem and rest assured, I can fix it! I have turned many homosexuals back into heterosexuals very easily!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil couldn&rsquo;t decide whether it was how confident Mr. Neil was or how he spoke about changing who Phil was with a giant ass smile but whatever it was, it caused Phil to go off. He yelled on and on about how being gay or loving somebody who was not of the opposite gender wasn&rsquo;t sinful and couldn&rsquo;t give more of a crap if people from nearby classrooms overheard. He expected the counselor to sit and patiently listen like any normal counselor would but boy was he wrong.</p><p>Mr. Neil, practically had fire spewing out of his ears as he listened to Phil rant. His hand was gripping the Bible on his desk so tightly, all his blood disappeared from his knuckles and shot up to his cherry colored cheeks. When Phil finished, Mr. Neil began rebutting Phil&rsquo;s words with his homophobic opinions. Halfway through the counselor&rsquo;s argument that it was &ldquo;Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve&rdquo; the bell rang and Phil bolted out of the counseling office.</p><p>The following days weren&rsquo;t any different and Phil was surprised that his voice wasn&rsquo;t already gone. Counseling was like having to deal with his dad, but at least Phil could argue back. He wanted to run away from this school as he hated Mr.Neil so much but Dan was the reason he stayed.</p><p>Phil had grown closer to Dan as a roommate and friend. Tony had only come back to his room a couple of times since the first day and Ben was always studying in the library or helping out teachers. While he and the boy with eyes as creamy as liquid fudge had initially bonded over bands, they soon discovered other common interests. Dan and Phil both loved dinosaurs and crystals and Phil love watching suspense and mystery movies as much as Dan did.</p><p>Phil wanted Dan to be his close friend at first, but now he was developing a full-on crush on his favorite brunette. He wasn&rsquo;t used to falling for people; he had grown to follow the &ldquo;no strings attached&rdquo; unspoken policy, hence the lack of past boyfriends. If Phil was being honest, he had wanted Dan to fall for him so he could bask in the glory of knowing there was another non-heterosexual person in this school. Yet, he now was paying too much attention to little details about Dan&rsquo;s beauty.</p><p>It was tough to keep up his &ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; act around someone whose giggles could turn his fingers into limp gummy worms. He had to gulp down admiration for Dan&rsquo;s perfect curls and he had to hide his grin when Dan stuck out his tongue during moments of intense concentration. After another frustrating period of &ldquo;counseling&rdquo;, Phil was relieved to find Dan in his room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Dan, how was class?&rdquo; Phil dropped his backpack on the floor and sat down next to Dan. Dan looked stressed with the frown pulled taut across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, can I talk to you about something?&rdquo; Dan bashfully asked, tucking a curl behind his ear, causing Phil&rsquo;s heart to flutter.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Phil tried to seem as light-hearted as possible as he wanted Dan to feel comfortable around him.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who else to come to but&hellip; I think I might be bisexual?
