Sweat slowly dripping from your  forehead making you feel disgusted and filthy. Your throat dry \u2014 in desperate need of water. So you do it again. Trying to move your hips without any music seems really embarrassing, especially for you. Feeling his eyes watching your every move makes you stiff. \u201cGod, Y/N. You\u2019re useless.\u201d His sharp words causes a sharp pain in your heart. </p><p>You exhale the long breath you\u2019ve been holding up, trying to calm yourself down. Simply standing up from your position, you walk to your bag full of your stuff picking up the untouched water bottle. He wouldn\u2019t even let you drink one drop, since you came here. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d His voice booms once again. </p><!-- more --><p>The water makes your throat feel more relaxed \u2014 no more dry. Closing the bottle up and tossing it back on the ground, you look into his eyes. His stern look almost makes you feel obedient once again, but this time you slowly compose your posture. \u201cDrinking? I\u2019ve been probably dehydrated this whole time.\u201d You speak with venom in your voice. </p><p>Not once, you\u2019ve raised your voice on him. You\u2019ve been respecting him ever since he started to teach you. The sunshine you met for the first time isn\u2019t the same guy, who is standing couple of meters behind you. Still remembering his red hair and wide smile welcoming you and few girls in this exact same practice room. His body shined with happiness and positivity. He looks like complete opposite right now. His brows furrowed while looking at you as if you\u2019ve stolen something from his. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve done your work, maybe you could have some rest.\u201d </p><p>Automatic snort comes from your lips, head shaking unbelievably. This is only your third class and you already think that this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re done here.\u201d He huffs looking at the Rolex watch on his wrist. He picks his sport bag from the floor, ready to leave. You can see the clock on the wall showing it\u2019s already 9pm \u2014 your class has ended. You pack your stuff when you hear annoyed sigh. Looking up at Hoseok, who is looking at you \u2014 annoyed. <i>Surprise! </i>He jiggles with the keys in his hand telling you silently, that he\u2019s supposed to lock up this practice room. You fasten up your stuff, mumbling soft \u2018sorry\u2019. Not sure if he heard you, you aren\u2019t expecting any answer anyway. </p><p>Tossing your sport bag over your shoulder you quickly leave from the practice room. You can hear him locking it and soon his footsteps behind you. Uncomfortable wind splashes to your face as soon as you come out of the building. You should\u2019ve wear something warmer than sweatpants, short sleeve T-shirt and thin sweater. It was supposed to be warm. Hoseok walks right pass you to his car without any goodbye. You watch him turning on engine and leaving from the parking lot \u2014 leaving you there standing in front of the building with crazy wind. <i>Jerk. He could\u2019ve ask you if you needed a ride home. </i>He even went in the same direction! </p><hr><p>\u201cHe is such a jerk!\u201d You exclaim to Namjoon, your brows furrowed with little pout on your lips. Of course, you had to complain to your best friend as soon as you could. \u201cHe left without asking me if I need a ride! It was freezing!\u201d You say dramatically, sounding maybe too angry. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s there to teach you, not to be all sweet to you.\u201d He shrugs before he continues slurping on his ramen. You huff watching his cheeks full of noodles. </p><p>\u201cYeah, well at least he doesn\u2019t have to be rude.\u201d You mumble annoyed, thinking about what happened the other night. It still makes you so annoyed and angry at him. His attitude is absolutely impolite and he shouldn\u2019t be treating you like that. The most confusing thing about it is \u2014 when you first met him he really was such a sweetheart. </p><p>You still remember going into the practice room to have a look on his dance class \u2014 making sure you really want to be a part of it. You remember him standing in front of the mirror showing you and other girls basic dance moves. Everyone was so quiet back there \u2014 all of your attention on him. He moved his body so naturally like everything he knows is how to dance. He looked so professional only focused on dancing \u2014 like ten girls aren\u2019t watching him. He didn\u2019t pay any attention to any of you. When music stopped, his serious behavior disappeared and cheerful himself was back. He greeted every each one of you, while everyone bowed their heads. Shaking your hands with bright smile. His professional dancing made you realize \u2014 he\u2019s the one. He\u2019s the one who is supposed to teach you how to dance. So you agreed to have classes with him. His price list wasn\u2019t really cheap, but when you saw his dancing&hellip; well, you\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s worth it. He is really good at what he\u2019s doing. </p><p>You remember your first class. He greeted you with small smile, he kept his attitude mostly neutral. Showing you all the right moves, explaining everything you\u2019ve done wrong. He was professional from the very start but now \u2014 he\u2019s too professional. He\u2019s so hard on you making you think he doesn\u2019t like you. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought about dropping?\u201d Namjoon pulls you out of your thoughts. </p><p>\u201cDropping what?\u201d You ask dumbfounded, noticing he finished his food \u2014 empty bowl in front of him and little bit sauce in the corner of his lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve little sauce here.\u201d You say pointing at his lips. </p><p>He awkwardly kisses his teeth, before quickly wiping it off in the reflection of the spoon beside him.<i> This guy. </i>He coughs adverting his attention back to you. \u201cThe class. Why don\u2019t you find someone else for dancing?\u201d He asked you simply. </p><p><i>He\u2019s right. </i>But unfortunately \u2014 Hoseok is probably the best dancer in your area. You can\u2019t probably find anyone that good. And you say the exact same thing to Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you find something else to keep you active then? Maybe swimming?\u201d He tries again. </p><p>\u201cJoon,\u201d You whine. \u201cYou know why I\u2019m doing this.\u201d</p><p>You know that you\u2019re not the best dancer, but you got the moves. You\u2019re still not completely confident in dancing in front of people, but you still try your best. Your decision to dancing is simple \u2014 you weren\u2019t confident with your body, so you decided to do something more active. You don\u2019t consider yourself as dancer, but more like someone who likes to dance and try to learn something about it. Plus, your family members calling you \u2018fat\u2019 and saying stuff like \u2018you got bigger\u2019 to you, didn\u2019t really help your confidence. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve decided to do this. You keep yourself occupied and active. It isn\u2019t for the looks anymore, more like you feel more healthier because you are more active. Watching movies all day while eating ramen and other not really healthy food wasn\u2019t really good and <i>healthy</i> idea.</p><p>\u201cYou can go hiking with me. Plus the nature is beautiful, you\u2019d love that.\u201d He suggests with cheerful gaze. He loves walking in the nature and the fresh air. He always shows you the pictures he takes, spending hours talking about how beautiful our nature is. You promised him that you\u2019d go with him sometimes. But your work and now dancing class don\u2019t really allow you that. Your exhaustion taking over as soon as you come home. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could do that twice a week. Dancing is perfect. Just Hoseok isn\u2019t.\u201d You grumble quietly, already fearing he\u2019s somewhere nearby waiting to snap at you. </p><p>You not knowing he isn\u2019t now \u2014 but he is on your next class. </p><hr><p>\u201cThank you, Hoseok! I can\u2019t wait for our next class.\u201d You hear girly voice before the practice door are opened. The girl, Seulgi, you believe comes out with bright smile waving before closing the door. You don\u2019t really know her but you\u2019ve spoke to her couple of times. She usually has her dance class before yours, so the two of you met often. \u201cOh, hey!\u201d She says when she sees you sitting on one of the chairs in front of the practice room.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d You greet her with kind smile giving her little wave. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you early?\u201d She asks you checking the time on her phone.</p><p>In fact, you really are early. After you and Namjoon went separate ways, you had nowhere else to go. So you got here little bit earlier \u2014 knowing Hoseok has fifteen minutes break. \u201cYeah,\u201d You nod. \u201cHow was the class?\u201d </p><p>Her smile widens even more. \u201cIt was amazing. Hoseok really is the best dancer here.\u201d She says with almost too enthusiasm and it makes your eyebrow twitch. </p><p>Well, you know he\u2019s the best dancer here. But that part about \u2018it was amazing\u2019 makes you slightly irritated. Is only your class so bad? \u201cHow\u2019s your class?\u201d She asks completely oblivious to your slightly irritated behavior. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s&hellip; good.\u201d You say unconvincingly with fake smile. </p><p>She eyes you strangely, opening her mouth ready to say something when another voice stops her. Your eyes finding Namjoon calling your name waving his hands in the distance. </p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d You ask standing up seeing breathless Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cYou forgot your lunch, moron.\u201d He tells you, the packed lunch in his hands. </p><p>Sudden realization washes over you. You were so irritated with Hoseok and thinking about your class, that you completely forgot to take it from the convenience store. \u201cOh my god! Thank you!\u201d You say with wide mouth taking the lunch from his hands. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He shrugs patting your head like you\u2019re some kid, making you roll your eyes. You see Seulgi waving her hand as goodbye, not wanting to interrupt you. You just wave her back, not really wanting to talk to her. Thinking about how she had something to say about your answer. </p><p>You don\u2019t really want to explain to her, how you really feel about Hoseok. Both of your heads snaps to the door which opens widely \u2014 Hoseok standing there watching you with raised eyebrow. You stare each other, until Hoseok inhales annoyingly. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our class.\u201d </p><p><i>Already?</i></p><p>\u201cThank you, again.\u201d You thank Namjoon for the last time, him giving you small smile in return. \u201cBye, Joon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d He slowly waves, Hoseok turning around with his back to both of you. </p><p>You mouth \u2018help me\u2019 at Namjoon and he gives you thumbs up. You see him turn around and leaving, while you go after Hoseok. You toss your sport bag to your usual spot, already preparing water bottle not caring what he thinks about it. If you\u2019re freaking thirsty, then you\u2019ll drink from it. You put your phone on silence, already knowing how Hoseok hates it. On your second class, your phone started to ring and then he became even more annoyed and irritated with you. You don\u2019t want him to hate you even more than he does now. You see the time on your phone, brows furrowed when you realize you had still time for your class to begin. He is suppose to have a break time. </p><p>\u201cDid you practice at home?\u201d He asks you already setting the speakers. </p><p>When you don\u2019t answer him, he turns back to you. You can see him wearing baby pink sweatpants, which are really looking great on him. Not many men can pull of pink color \u2014 Hoseok not being one of them. Simple white T-shirt covering his torso, but you can still see the outlines of his abs. You gulp shifting your gaze at his face. \u201cYes?\u201d You answer more in question making him stand up.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t practice?\u201d He asks you with loud voice. His voice already echoing throughout the room once again. Not liking his tone of voice, you bit your lip in nervousness. Even though you\u2019re not appreciating his attitude to you, you\u2019re still quiet. Some part of you is scared of him. He\u2019s really scary when he\u2019s angry or even only irritated. </p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve practice?\u201d You ask almost too quickly and his face is basically red as soon as those words pass your lips. </p><p>He smacks his phone onto the small table in the corner with loud smack, making you gulp nervously. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to practice but you have time to hangout with your boyfriend?\u201d He asks lowly, almost too normal making him look even scarier. </p><p>You see little vein popping on his neck \u2014 the view hot and scary at the same time. You should feel scared but when sudden throb between your legs awakens you, you want to almost laugh. <i>Are you really getting turned on by Hoseok\u2019s attitude?</i></p><p>You ignore that \u2018boyfriend\u2019 part, not really getting what he means. Does he think Namjoon is your boyfriend? Yet again, you want to laugh. But you don\u2019t. You keep your neutral gaze too scared to look away. \u201cVery well, then.\u201d He speaks turning around again. </p><p>You\u2019re watching his broad shoulders and masculine back, as he shuffles through different songs. The song completely unfamiliar to you, starts playing. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d You hear him say already standing in the middle of the room waiting for you to come there. The annoying look that you\u2019re not already there \u2014 dominating his face. <i>Great. Just Great. </i></p><p>He shows you a few moves which he wants you to learn this time. You watch his every move carefully trying to remember the small \u2018choreography\u2019. \u201cThis is supposed to be danced by two people, but as you have just seen it\u2019s possible to dance it just on your own.\u201d He explains pausing the music. </p><p>The moves aren\u2019t hard itself, but maybe it\u2019s because Hoseok made it look super easy. Another confirmation for you to know, that he truly is the master of what he\u2019s doing. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it toghether since I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll do it by yourself. You need guidance.\u201d</p><p><i>Did he just insult you while being professional? </i></p><p>You ignore his little jab at you, only nodding in return. You\u2019re not really in the mood for fighting, not like you\u2019d fight him. The only time you\u2019ve really talked back to him was about that water bottle. <i>How stupid, right?</i></p><p>\u201cDo you remember any part of it?\u201d He asks you.</p><p>What you\u2019re supposed to tell him? You\u2019ve remembered some little parts, but you know that\u2019s not enough for him. Without waiting for your response he turns to the mirror. \u201cCome here.\u201d He says motioning with his hands for you to come there.</p><p>You get there really quickly not wanting him to be pissed off this whole hour. \u201cYou\u2019ll just mimic my moves. You\u2019ll get the hang of it when we start to dance. At least I hope so.\u201d He mumbles the last part more for himself, but you still hear him. Annoyance rushing over your blood making you want to slap him. <i>How fucking rude!</i></p><p>He starts the music waiting for the beat drop. Standing right beside him you look at yourself in the mirror. Your cheeks are already flushed and you haven\u2019t even started. He starts moving, you quickly copying his every move. You have to admit \u2014 your moves aren\u2019t that bad. Hoseok makes you feel, like you can\u2019t dance at all. Not the fact, that obviously \u2014 he\u2019s the best dancer you\u2019ve ever seen. But more like, his constant comments and insults your way makes you think, that you\u2019re not good enough. </p><p>The whole \u2018choreography\u2019 lasts only like for two minutes. He pauses the music, putting his phone back on the floor. \u201cIt was&hellip; okay.\u201d He speaks, fingers rushing over his red hair. </p><p><i>Okay? </i>You thought you danced amazing! You hit every beat and the fact that you remembered the whole choreography by only just looking at him, is kind of impressive. </p><p>Almost rolling your eyes, you catch yourself before you can. \u201cBut it was still empty. It was just like two persons dancing beside each other.\u201d</p><p><i>Isn\u2019t that what you were doing? Dancing beside each other?</i></p><p>Then you remember his words. It was supposed to be dancing with each other. Not beside each other. Suddenly getting his words you nod understandably. </p><p>\u201cWe will continue to do the same thing, but we will touch each other so it looks more naturally. Just let the music and me move you.\u201d He says before bending to his phone, starting the song again. </p><p>You flinch little bit when his fingers touch your hand, leaving goosebumps there. He pulls you closer to his body, heat radiating from him. You\u2019re almost leaning against his hard chest, when he starts moving you to the beat. It looks and feels hard from the start, but Hoseok\u2019s moving your body like you\u2019ve no control over it. You quickly start to dance the moves exactly how you remember. It was the move when you were about to go left, but you turn right. Bumping your head right into Hoseok\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He yelps touching his nose with scrunched face.</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d You\u2019re quick to put hand onto your mouth and telling apologizes over and over again. </p><p>Your head hurts little bit, so you don\u2019t even want to know how Hoseok\u2019s nose feels right now. \u201cTurn the fucking music off!\u201d He snaps, hand still on his nose making his voice sounding muffled. You\u2019re quick to run to his phone, turning the music off just how he asked. Well, not really asked. More like commanded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Hoseok. Does it hurt too much?\u201d You ask with concern trying to see his nose. </p><p>\u201cNo, I yelped just for fun. Of course it hurts.\u201d He spits at you, closing his eyes trying to relief some pain. </p><p>You don\u2019t really pay attention to his rudeness, because you really feel sorry. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do that. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You apologize once again with guilt all over your face. </p><p>Hoseok doesn\u2019t spare you one glance, walking closer to the mirror. He takes his hand off from his nose, looking at his bloody nose. <i>Shit! </i>You made him bleed. It\u2019s not something drastic&hellip; but still. </p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d You ask carefully not really want to piss him off even more. </p><p>\u201cLearn how to dance, maybe?\u201d</p><p><i>You deserved it, you jerk! </i>You\u2019re ready to yell but you bite your tongue. The whole situation becoming somehow funny and it amuses you. </p><p>\u201cAre you fucking smirking at me?\u201d He asks, drop of blood dripping from his nose. He\u2019s quick to wipe it with his finger.</p><p>You immediately widen your mouth realizing that \u2014 in fact, you were. \u201cNo!\u201d You deny shaking his head.</p><p>He huffs annoyingly turning around, not wanting to piss himself even more. He shuffles in his bag pulling out tissues. He wipes his nose biting his tongue to prevent him from hissing. <i>It fucking hurts! </i>The tissue is red from blood almost immediately. It looks terrifying even though you don\u2019t have hemophobia. </p><p>An idea pops in your head, quickly scurrying to your bad finding a wallet. You run out of the practice room to the small buffet which should be closing up any minute. </p><p>\u201cDo you have anything cold, please?\u201d You asks hurriedly, the old lady raising one brow. </p><p>\u201cFrozen peas?\u201d She asks already pulling it out from the freezer. </p><p>It\u2019s your turn to raise one brow. \u201cWhy do you have frozen peas?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say, there\u2019re a lot of accidents here.\u201d She explains, making you nod. </p><p>You pay quickly, bowing your head already running back to Hoseok. You find him sitting on the floor while leaning against the wall, his head thrown back. \u201cHere.\u201d You say handing him the package of frozen peas.</p><p>He looks up \u2014 confusion written in his expression. \u201cWhere would you got this?\u201d He asks but still taking it from you, gently putting it on his nose. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d You simple shrug. You stand there for awhile after he puts the package on the floor \u2014 tearing a piece of the tissue stuffing it into his nose. \u201cDoes it still hurt so much?\u201d You ask softly, not wanting him to be mad. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better now.\u201d He mumbles.</p><p>You can do nothing more than just awkwardly stand there. And as fast as your class began, it ended as well. </p><hr><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Namjoon screeches when you tell him about the accident \u2014 accidentally making Hoseok\u2019s nose bleed. His laugh literally going \u2018HAHAHAH\u2019 fills the whole car making you cringed at the loud sound. Let\u2019s say, you barely slept throughout the night. Catching up the work you\u2019re supposed to have done by today. You did it, you just had to be up almost all night. It\u2019s raining the whole day and your mood suddenly falls, the weather making your day worse. Plus, it\u2019s your dancing class again. You haven\u2019t seen Hoseok since the accident. He told you to go home and you obeyed gladly. Embarrassment filling your whole body and you\u2019d be really happy, if you could say it felt. It didn\u2019t. You want to hide and never show up to his classes ever again, but then you\u2019d just be a coward. Your mom always taught you to face your problems \u2014 now it\u2019s time. </p><p>Thankfully Namjoon stopped by your apartment for a second and asked you if you want a ride. You\u2019d usually bother him and walk there, but because of the weather is pretty much awful \u2014 you said yes. So he\u2019s driving you there.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing.\u201d You say but start to laugh yourself. <i>God, you\u2019re so embarrassed but it\u2019s funny at the same time. </i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so clumsy.\u201d He comments already turning to the direction of the building. </p><p>\u201cYeah? And you\u2019re not? You eat like little kid and always somehow gets your clothes dirty because of it. And I don\u2019t know who always stumbles even though the sidewalk is flat.\u201d You comment back making him stop laughing.</p><p>\u201cHey, I never said I\u2019m not.\u201d He defends himself with slight chuckle, making you chuckle back. </p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019re both clumsy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re more clumsy than me. You punched someone in the nose because of your clumsiness.\u201d He says jokingly making you snort.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly punch him. I just&hellip;\u201d You trailed off not really knowing how to explain it. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I get.\u201d Namjoon sways his hand at you annoyingly. He\u2019s probably happy that he isn\u2019t the only one with really embarrassing story now. </p><p>He parks in front of the building. You thank him for the drive telling him you\u2019ll treat him with some ramen, which he politely declines. As soon as you step out of the car, you quickly run inside. Rain wetting your clothes in the process. You wave at Namjoon last time before disappearing inside. </p><p>Already having your sports clothes on \u2014 black leggings with white tank top and nice puma trainers \u2014 spare you a time of changing your clothes. You always does this. You come in your sports clothes and then when you\u2019re done, you simply change to your casual clothes. Thanks to the lockers in the practice room. </p><p>You sit inside of the practice room \u2014checking the time before you did, of course \u2014 but stopping when you see someone else in the room. There\u2019s Hoseok with beanie covering his hair wearing his casual clothes, but in different colors this time. His sweatpants, T-shirt and trainers are all black. Well, he definitely looks good in everything. But beside him is someone else \u2014 guy looking slightly younger than Hoseok. \u201cAm I too early?\u201d You ask, nervously clutching the strap of your sport bag. </p><p>You catch their attention, their heads turning to you. Hoseok rolling his eyes off while turning back to the guy. It looks like he wanted to be discreet, but you still saw him. <i>Jerk.</i></p><p>\u201cIs this the girl who punched you?\u201d The guy asks with loud laughter, showing his bunny smile and scrunched nose. <i>He is cute. </i>You come inside, the door shutting by itself. </p><p>You almost laugh with him, but catching yourself just in time not to. Hoseok gives him nasty glare ready to throw some insult his way, when there\u2019s a knock. The door opens slowly, Namjoon blonde head peeking out. </p><p>\u201cJoon?\u201d You ask surprised, his eyes meeting yours. </p><p>\u201cHey, sorry. Didn\u2019t want to interrupt but I forgot to give you this.\u201d He explains handing you dark blue umbrella with colorful little crabs all over it. \u201cIt might be raining when you go home. I\u2019d pick you up but I\u2019ve to go to help mom.\u201d He explains more, making you smile at him. </p><p>You take the umbrella from his hand. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d You thank him. The both guys simply staring at you in silence. </p><p>His eyes gazing over them, before quickly saying; \u201cSee you later.\u201d And he left just as quick as that. You didn\u2019t even give him a proper goodbye. </p><p>When turning around, you figured why he left so quickly. Hoseok intimidating and sharp gaze looking at you. \u201cHow\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d He asks bitterly, voice filled with mockery and irritation. You don\u2019t even bother to correct him. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your nose?\u201d You ask back, before you can stop yourself. You\u2019re kind of glad that you didn\u2019t.</p><p>The guy beside him bursts in laughter once again, while the two of you are having staring contest. </p><p>\u201cShit, I already love her!\u201d The guy says enthusiastically walking pass Hoseok, bumping into him little bit in the process, before coming to you. \u201cI\u2019m Jungguk. Hoseok\u2019s friend,\u201d He says with bunny smile already stretching his hand to you. You slowly take it, him looking back at Hoseok who gives him cold stare. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not so sure anymore. He\u2019s intimidated when he\u2019s pissed.\u201d He whispers to you, making you giggle. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d You introduce yourself with polite smile. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really want to talk to you some more, but your class already started and I have to go as well,\u201d He says and pouts fakily, making him look even cuter. \u201cI\u2019m teaching boxing, so if you\u2019d really want to learn boxing you know where to go,\u201d He smirks little bit making you blush. You\u2019ve never really seen so many handsome guys all at once. \u201cBut I think you already know how to throw a punch.\u201d He says grinning cheekily at Hoseok. </p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d He snaps in response, but Jungguk is basically sprinting out of the practice room.</p><p>\u201cLove you, hyung! Bye Y/N!\u201d He yells but before any of you can response, he\u2019s gone. </p><p>\u201cFucking brat.\u201d You hear Hoseok mumble and you look at him. His nose looks fine like it was never punched before. He catches your stare looking at you with his cold gaze. </p><p><i>He surely hates you even more than he did. Yay! </i></p>",

Sweat slowly dripping from your  forehead making you feel disgusted and filthy. Your throat dry \u2014 in desperate need of water. So you do it again. Trying to move your hips without any music seems really embarrassing, especially for you. Feeling his eyes watching your every move makes you stiff. \u201cGod, Y/N. You\u2019re useless.\u201d His sharp words causes a sharp pain in your heart. </p><p>You exhale the long breath you\u2019ve been holding up, trying to calm yourself down. Simply standing up from your position, you walk to your bag full of your stuff picking up the untouched water bottle. He wouldn\u2019t even let you drink one drop, since you came here. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d His voice booms once again. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The water makes your throat feel more relaxed \u2014 no more dry. Closing the bottle up and tossing it back on the ground, you look into his eyes. His stern look almost makes you feel obedient once again, but this time you slowly compose your posture. \u201cDrinking? I\u2019ve been probably dehydrated this whole time.\u201d You speak with venom in your voice. </p><p>Not once, you\u2019ve raised your voice on him. You\u2019ve been respecting him ever since he started to teach you. The sunshine you met for the first time isn\u2019t the same guy, who is standing couple of meters behind you. Still remembering his red hair and wide smile welcoming you and few girls in this exact same practice room. His body shined with happiness and positivity. He looks like complete opposite right now. His brows furrowed while looking at you as if you\u2019ve stolen something from his. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve done your work, maybe you could have some rest.\u201d </p><p>Automatic snort comes from your lips, head shaking unbelievably. This is only your third class and you already think that this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re done here.\u201d He huffs looking at the Rolex watch on his wrist. He picks his sport bag from the floor, ready to leave. You can see the clock on the wall showing it\u2019s already 9pm \u2014 your class has ended. You pack your stuff when you hear annoyed sigh. Looking up at Hoseok, who is looking at you \u2014 annoyed. <i>Surprise! </i>He jiggles with the keys in his hand telling you silently, that he\u2019s supposed to lock up this practice room. You fasten up your stuff, mumbling soft \u2018sorry\u2019. Not sure if he heard you, you aren\u2019t expecting any answer anyway. </p><p>Tossing your sport bag over your shoulder you quickly leave from the practice room. You can hear him locking it and soon his footsteps behind you. Uncomfortable wind splashes to your face as soon as you come out of the building. You should\u2019ve wear something warmer than sweatpants, short sleeve T-shirt and thin sweater. It was supposed to be warm. Hoseok walks right pass you to his car without any goodbye. You watch him turning on engine and leaving from the parking lot \u2014 leaving you there standing in front of the building with crazy wind. <i>Jerk. He could\u2019ve ask you if you needed a ride home. </i>He even went in the same direction! </p><hr><p>\u201cHe is such a jerk!\u201d You exclaim to Namjoon, your brows furrowed with little pout on your lips. Of course, you had to complain to your best friend as soon as you could. \u201cHe left without asking me if I need a ride! It was freezing!\u201d You say dramatically, sounding maybe too angry. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s there to teach you, not to be all sweet to you.\u201d He shrugs before he continues slurping on his ramen. You huff watching his cheeks full of noodles. </p><p>\u201cYeah, well at least he doesn\u2019t have to be rude.\u201d You mumble annoyed, thinking about what happened the other night. It still makes you so annoyed and angry at him. His attitude is absolutely impolite and he shouldn\u2019t be treating you like that. The most confusing thing about it is \u2014 when you first met him he really was such a sweetheart. </p><p>You still remember going into the practice room to have a look on his dance class \u2014 making sure you really want to be a part of it. You remember him standing in front of the mirror showing you and other girls basic dance moves. Everyone was so quiet back there \u2014 all of your attention on him. He moved his body so naturally like everything he knows is how to dance. He looked so professional only focused on dancing \u2014 like ten girls aren\u2019t watching him. He didn\u2019t pay any attention to any of you. When music stopped, his serious behavior disappeared and cheerful himself was back. He greeted every each one of you, while everyone bowed their heads. Shaking your hands with bright smile. His professional dancing made you realize \u2014 he\u2019s the one. He\u2019s the one who is supposed to teach you how to dance. So you agreed to have classes with him. His price list wasn\u2019t really cheap, but when you saw his dancing\u2026 well, you\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s worth it. He is really good at what he\u2019s doing. </p><p>You remember your first class. He greeted you with small smile, he kept his attitude mostly neutral. Showing you all the right moves, explaining everything you\u2019ve done wrong. He was professional from the very start but now \u2014 he\u2019s too professional. He\u2019s so hard on you making you think he doesn\u2019t like you. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought about dropping?\u201d Namjoon pulls you out of your thoughts. </p><p>\u201cDropping what?\u201d You ask dumbfounded, noticing he finished his food \u2014 empty bowl in front of him and little bit sauce in the corner of his lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve little sauce here.\u201d You say pointing at his lips. </p><p>He awkwardly kisses his teeth, before quickly wiping it off in the reflection of the spoon beside him.<i> This guy. </i>He coughs adverting his attention back to you. \u201cThe class. Why don\u2019t you find someone else for dancing?\u201d He asked you simply. </p><p><i>He\u2019s right. </i>But unfortunately \u2014 Hoseok is probably the best dancer in your area. You can\u2019t probably find anyone that good. And you say the exact same thing to Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you find something else to keep you active then? Maybe swimming?\u201d He tries again. </p><p>\u201cJoon,\u201d You whine. \u201cYou know why I\u2019m doing this.\u201d</p><p>You know that you\u2019re not the best dancer, but you got the moves. You\u2019re still not completely confident in dancing in front of people, but you still try your best. Your decision to dancing is simple \u2014 you weren\u2019t confident with your body, so you decided to do something more active. You don\u2019t consider yourself as dancer, but more like someone who likes to dance and try to learn something about it. Plus, your family members calling you \u2018fat\u2019 and saying stuff like \u2018you got bigger\u2019 to you, didn\u2019t really help your confidence. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve decided to do this. You keep yourself occupied and active. It isn\u2019t for the looks anymore, more like you feel more healthier because you are more active. Watching movies all day while eating ramen and other not really healthy food wasn\u2019t really good and <i>healthy</i> idea.</p><p>\u201cYou can go hiking with me. Plus the nature is beautiful, you\u2019d love that.\u201d He suggests with cheerful gaze. He loves walking in the nature and the fresh air. He always shows you the pictures he takes, spending hours talking about how beautiful our nature is. You promised him that you\u2019d go with him sometimes. But your work and now dancing class don\u2019t really allow you that. Your exhaustion taking over as soon as you come home. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could do that twice a week. Dancing is perfect. Just Hoseok isn\u2019t.\u201d You grumble quietly, already fearing he\u2019s somewhere nearby waiting to snap at you. </p><p>You not knowing he isn\u2019t now \u2014 but he is on your next class. </p><hr><p>\u201cThank you, Hoseok! I can\u2019t wait for our next class.\u201d You hear girly voice before the practice door are opened. The girl, Seulgi, you believe comes out with bright smile waving before closing the door. You don\u2019t really know her but you\u2019ve spoke to her couple of times. She usually has her dance class before yours, so the two of you met often. \u201cOh, hey!\u201d She says when she sees you sitting on one of the chairs in front of the practice room.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d You greet her with kind smile giving her little wave. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you early?\u201d She asks you checking the time on her phone.</p><p>In fact, you really are early. After you and Namjoon went separate ways, you had nowhere else to go. So you got here little bit earlier \u2014 knowing Hoseok has fifteen minutes break. \u201cYeah,\u201d You nod. \u201cHow was the class?\u201d </p><p>Her smile widens even more. \u201cIt was amazing. Hoseok really is the best dancer here.\u201d She says with almost too enthusiasm and it makes your eyebrow twitch. </p><p>Well, you know he\u2019s the best dancer here. But that part about \u2018it was amazing\u2019 makes you slightly irritated. Is only your class so bad? \u201cHow\u2019s your class?\u201d She asks completely oblivious to your slightly irritated behavior. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 good.\u201d You say unconvincingly with fake smile. </p><p>She eyes you strangely, opening her mouth ready to say something when another voice stops her. Your eyes finding Namjoon calling your name waving his hands in the distance. </p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d You ask standing up seeing breathless Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cYou forgot your lunch, moron.\u201d He tells you, the packed lunch in his hands. </p><p>Sudden realization washes over you. You were so irritated with Hoseok and thinking about your class, that you completely forgot to take it from the convenience store. \u201cOh my god! Thank you!\u201d You say with wide mouth taking the lunch from his hands. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He shrugs patting your head like you\u2019re some kid, making you roll your eyes. You see Seulgi waving her hand as goodbye, not wanting to interrupt you. You just wave her back, not really wanting to talk to her. Thinking about how she had something to say about your answer. </p><p>You don\u2019t really want to explain to her, how you really feel about Hoseok. Both of your heads snaps to the door which opens widely \u2014 Hoseok standing there watching you with raised eyebrow. You stare each other, until Hoseok inhales annoyingly. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our class.\u201d </p><p><i>Already?</i></p><p>\u201cThank you, again.\u201d You thank Namjoon for the last time, him giving you small smile in return. \u201cBye, Joon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d He slowly waves, Hoseok turning around with his back to both of you. </p><p>You mouth \u2018help me\u2019 at Namjoon and he gives you thumbs up. You see him turn around and leaving, while you go after Hoseok. You toss your sport bag to your usual spot, already preparing water bottle not caring what he thinks about it. If you\u2019re freaking thirsty, then you\u2019ll drink from it. You put your phone on silence, already knowing how Hoseok hates it. On your second class, your phone started to ring and then he became even more annoyed and irritated with you. You don\u2019t want him to hate you even more than he does now. You see the time on your phone, brows furrowed when you realize you had still time for your class to begin. He is suppose to have a break time. </p><p>\u201cDid you practice at home?\u201d He asks you already setting the speakers. </p><p>When you don\u2019t answer him, he turns back to you. You can see him wearing baby pink sweatpants, which are really looking great on him. Not many men can pull of pink color \u2014 Hoseok not being one of them. Simple white T-shirt covering his torso, but you can still see the outlines of his abs. You gulp shifting your gaze at his face. \u201cYes?\u201d You answer more in question making him stand up.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t practice?\u201d He asks you with loud voice. His voice already echoing throughout the room once again. Not liking his tone of voice, you bit your lip in nervousness. Even though you\u2019re not appreciating his attitude to you, you\u2019re still quiet. Some part of you is scared of him. He\u2019s really scary when he\u2019s angry or even only irritated. </p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve practice?\u201d You ask almost too quickly and his face is basically red as soon as those words pass your lips. </p><p>He smacks his phone onto the small table in the corner with loud smack, making you gulp nervously. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to practice but you have time to hangout with your boyfriend?\u201d He asks lowly, almost too normal making him look even scarier. </p><p>You see little vein popping on his neck \u2014 the view hot and scary at the same time. You should feel scared but when sudden throb between your legs awakens you, you want to almost laugh. <i>Are you really getting turned on by Hoseok\u2019s attitude?</i></p><p>You ignore that \u2018boyfriend\u2019 part, not really getting what he means. Does he think Namjoon is your boyfriend? Yet again, you want to laugh. But you don\u2019t. You keep your neutral gaze too scared to look away. \u201cVery well, then.\u201d He speaks turning around again. </p><p>You\u2019re watching his broad shoulders and masculine back, as he shuffles through different songs. The song completely unfamiliar to you, starts playing. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d You hear him say already standing in the middle of the room waiting for you to come there. The annoying look that you\u2019re not already there \u2014 dominating his face. <i>Great. Just Great. </i></p><p>He shows you a few moves which he wants you to learn this time. You watch his every move carefully trying to remember the small \u2018choreography\u2019. \u201cThis is supposed to be danced by two people, but as you have just seen it\u2019s possible to dance it just on your own.\u201d He explains pausing the music. </p><p>The moves aren\u2019t hard itself, but maybe it\u2019s because Hoseok made it look super easy. Another confirmation for you to know, that he truly is the master of what he\u2019s doing. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it toghether since I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll do it by yourself. You need guidance.\u201d</p><p><i>Did he just insult you while being professional? </i></p><p>You ignore his little jab at you, only nodding in return. You\u2019re not really in the mood for fighting, not like you\u2019d fight him. The only time you\u2019ve really talked back to him was about that water bottle. <i>How stupid, right?</i></p><p>\u201cDo you remember any part of it?\u201d He asks you.</p><p>What you\u2019re supposed to tell him? You\u2019ve remembered some little parts, but you know that\u2019s not enough for him. Without waiting for your response he turns to the mirror. \u201cCome here.\u201d He says motioning with his hands for you to come there.</p><p>You get there really quickly not wanting him to be pissed off this whole hour. \u201cYou\u2019ll just mimic my moves. You\u2019ll get the hang of it when we start to dance. At least I hope so.\u201d He mumbles the last part more for himself, but you still hear him. Annoyance rushing over your blood making you want to slap him. <i>How fucking rude!</i></p><p>He starts the music waiting for the beat drop. Standing right beside him you look at yourself in the mirror. Your cheeks are already flushed and you haven\u2019t even started. He starts moving, you quickly copying his every move. You have to admit \u2014 your moves aren\u2019t that bad. Hoseok makes you feel, like you can\u2019t dance at all. Not the fact, that obviously \u2014 he\u2019s the best dancer you\u2019ve ever seen. But more like, his constant comments and insults your way makes you think, that you\u2019re not good enough. </p><p>The whole \u2018choreography\u2019 lasts only like for two minutes. He pauses the music, putting his phone back on the floor. \u201cIt was\u2026 okay.\u201d He speaks, fingers rushing over his red hair. </p><p><i>Okay? </i>You thought you danced amazing! You hit every beat and the fact that you remembered the whole choreography by only just looking at him, is kind of impressive. </p><p>Almost rolling your eyes, you catch yourself before you can. \u201cBut it was still empty. It was just like two persons dancing beside each other.\u201d</p><p><i>Isn\u2019t that what you were doing? Dancing beside each other?</i></p><p>Then you remember his words. It was supposed to be dancing with each other. Not beside each other. Suddenly getting his words you nod understandably. </p><p>\u201cWe will continue to do the same thing, but we will touch each other so it looks more naturally. Just let the music and me move you.\u201d He says before bending to his phone, starting the song again. </p><p>You flinch little bit when his fingers touch your hand, leaving goosebumps there. He pulls you closer to his body, heat radiating from him. You\u2019re almost leaning against his hard chest, when he starts moving you to the beat. It looks and feels hard from the start, but Hoseok\u2019s moving your body like you\u2019ve no control over it. You quickly start to dance the moves exactly how you remember. It was the move when you were about to go left, but you turn right. Bumping your head right into Hoseok\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He yelps touching his nose with scrunched face.</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d You\u2019re quick to put hand onto your mouth and telling apologizes over and over again. </p><p>Your head hurts little bit, so you don\u2019t even want to know how Hoseok\u2019s nose feels right now. \u201cTurn the fucking music off!\u201d He snaps, hand still on his nose making his voice sounding muffled. You\u2019re quick to run to his phone, turning the music off just how he asked. Well, not really asked. More like commanded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Hoseok. Does it hurt too much?\u201d You ask with concern trying to see his nose. </p><p>\u201cNo, I yelped just for fun. Of course it hurts.\u201d He spits at you, closing his eyes trying to relief some pain. </p><p>You don\u2019t really pay attention to his rudeness, because you really feel sorry. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do that. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You apologize once again with guilt all over your face. </p><p>Hoseok doesn\u2019t spare you one glance, walking closer to the mirror. He takes his hand off from his nose, looking at his bloody nose. <i>Shit! </i>You made him bleed. It\u2019s not something drastic\u2026 but still. </p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d You ask carefully not really want to piss him off even more. </p><p>\u201cLearn how to dance, maybe?\u201d</p><p><i>You deserved it, you jerk! </i>You\u2019re ready to yell but you bite your tongue. The whole situation becoming somehow funny and it amuses you. </p><p>\u201cAre you fucking smirking at me?\u201d He asks, drop of blood dripping from his nose. He\u2019s quick to wipe it with his finger.</p><p>You immediately widen your mouth realizing that \u2014 in fact, you were. \u201cNo!\u201d You deny shaking his head.</p><p>He huffs annoyingly turning around, not wanting to piss himself even more. He shuffles in his bag pulling out tissues. He wipes his nose biting his tongue to prevent him from hissing. <i>It fucking hurts! </i>The tissue is red from blood almost immediately. It looks terrifying even though you don\u2019t have hemophobia. </p><p>An idea pops in your head, quickly scurrying to your bad finding a wallet. You run out of the practice room to the small buffet which should be closing up any minute. </p><p>\u201cDo you have anything cold, please?\u201d You asks hurriedly, the old lady raising one brow. </p><p>\u201cFrozen peas?\u201d She asks already pulling it out from the freezer. </p><p>It\u2019s your turn to raise one brow. \u201cWhy do you have frozen peas?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say, there\u2019re a lot of accidents here.\u201d She explains, making you nod. </p><p>You pay quickly, bowing your head already running back to Hoseok. You find him sitting on the floor while leaning against the wall, his head thrown back. \u201cHere.\u201d You say handing him the package of frozen peas.</p><p>He looks up \u2014 confusion written in his expression. \u201cWhere would you got this?\u201d He asks but still taking it from you, gently putting it on his nose. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d You simple shrug. You stand there for awhile after he puts the package on the floor \u2014 tearing a piece of the tissue stuffing it into his nose. \u201cDoes it still hurt so much?\u201d You ask softly, not wanting him to be mad. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better now.\u201d He mumbles.</p><p>You can do nothing more than just awkwardly stand there. And as fast as your class began, it ended as well. </p><hr><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Namjoon screeches when you tell him about the accident \u2014 accidentally making Hoseok\u2019s nose bleed. His laugh literally going \u2018HAHAHAH\u2019 fills the whole car making you cringed at the loud sound. Let\u2019s say, you barely slept throughout the night. Catching up the work you\u2019re supposed to have done by today. You did it, you just had to be up almost all night. It\u2019s raining the whole day and your mood suddenly falls, the weather making your day worse. Plus, it\u2019s your dancing class again. You haven\u2019t seen Hoseok since the accident. He told you to go home and you obeyed gladly. Embarrassment filling your whole body and you\u2019d be really happy, if you could say it felt. It didn\u2019t. You want to hide and never show up to his classes ever again, but then you\u2019d just be a coward. Your mom always taught you to face your problems \u2014 now it\u2019s time. </p><p>Thankfully Namjoon stopped by your apartment for a second and asked you if you want a ride. You\u2019d usually bother him and walk there, but because of the weather is pretty much awful \u2014 you said yes. So he\u2019s driving you there.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing.\u201d You say but start to laugh yourself. <i>God, you\u2019re so embarrassed but it\u2019s funny at the same time. </i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so clumsy.\u201d He comments already turning to the direction of the building. </p><p>\u201cYeah? And you\u2019re not? You eat like little kid and always somehow gets your clothes dirty because of it. And I don\u2019t know who always stumbles even though the sidewalk is flat.\u201d You comment back making him stop laughing.</p><p>\u201cHey, I never said I\u2019m not.\u201d He defends himself with slight chuckle, making you chuckle back. </p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019re both clumsy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re more clumsy than me. You punched someone in the nose because of your clumsiness.\u201d He says jokingly making you snort.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly punch him. I just\u2026\u201d You trailed off not really knowing how to explain it. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I get.\u201d Namjoon sways his hand at you annoyingly. He\u2019s probably happy that he isn\u2019t the only one with really embarrassing story now. </p><p>He parks in front of the building. You thank him for the drive telling him you\u2019ll treat him with some ramen, which he politely declines. As soon as you step out of the car, you quickly run inside. Rain wetting your clothes in the process. You wave at Namjoon last time before disappearing inside. </p><p>Already having your sports clothes on \u2014 black leggings with white tank top and nice puma trainers \u2014 spare you a time of changing your clothes. You always does this. You come in your sports clothes and then when you\u2019re done, you simply change to your casual clothes. Thanks to the lockers in the practice room. </p><p>You sit inside of the practice room \u2014checking the time before you did, of course \u2014 but stopping when you see someone else in the room. There\u2019s Hoseok with beanie covering his hair wearing his casual clothes, but in different colors this time. His sweatpants, T-shirt and trainers are all black. Well, he definitely looks good in everything. But beside him is someone else \u2014 guy looking slightly younger than Hoseok. \u201cAm I too early?\u201d You ask, nervously clutching the strap of your sport bag. </p><p>You catch their attention, their heads turning to you. Hoseok rolling his eyes off while turning back to the guy. It looks like he wanted to be discreet, but you still saw him. <i>Jerk.</i></p><p>\u201cIs this the girl who punched you?\u201d The guy asks with loud laughter, showing his bunny smile and scrunched nose. <i>He is cute. </i>You come inside, the door shutting by itself. </p><p>You almost laugh with him, but catching yourself just in time not to. Hoseok gives him nasty glare ready to throw some insult his way, when there\u2019s a knock. The door opens slowly, Namjoon blonde head peeking out. </p><p>\u201cJoon?\u201d You ask surprised, his eyes meeting yours. </p><p>\u201cHey, sorry. Didn\u2019t want to interrupt but I forgot to give you this.\u201d He explains handing you dark blue umbrella with colorful little crabs all over it. \u201cIt might be raining when you go home. I\u2019d pick you up but I\u2019ve to go to help mom.\u201d He explains more, making you smile at him. </p><p>You take the umbrella from his hand. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d You thank him. The both guys simply staring at you in silence. </p><p>His eyes gazing over them, before quickly saying; \u201cSee you later.\u201d And he left just as quick as that. You didn\u2019t even give him a proper goodbye. </p><p>When turning around, you figured why he left so quickly. Hoseok intimidating and sharp gaze looking at you. \u201cHow\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d He asks bitterly, voice filled with mockery and irritation. You don\u2019t even bother to correct him. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your nose?\u201d You ask back, before you can stop yourself. You\u2019re kind of glad that you didn\u2019t.</p><p>The guy beside him bursts in laughter once again, while the two of you are having staring contest. </p><p>\u201cShit, I already love her!\u201d The guy says enthusiastically walking pass Hoseok, bumping into him little bit in the process, before coming to you. \u201cI\u2019m Jungguk. Hoseok\u2019s friend,\u201d He says with bunny smile already stretching his hand to you. You slowly take it, him looking back at Hoseok who gives him cold stare. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not so sure anymore. He\u2019s intimidated when he\u2019s pissed.\u201d He whispers to you, making you giggle. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d You introduce yourself with polite smile. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really want to talk to you some more, but your class already started and I have to go as well,\u201d He says and pouts fakily, making him look even cuter. \u201cI\u2019m teaching boxing, so if you\u2019d really want to learn boxing you know where to go,\u201d He smirks little bit making you blush. You\u2019ve never really seen so many handsome guys all at once. \u201cBut I think you already know how to throw a punch.\u201d He says grinning cheekily at Hoseok. </p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d He snaps in response, but Jungguk is basically sprinting out of the practice room.</p><p>\u201cLove you, hyung! Bye Y/N!\u201d He yells but before any of you can response, he\u2019s gone. </p><p>\u201cFucking brat.\u201d You hear Hoseok mumble and you look at him. His nose looks fine like it was never punched before. He catches your stare looking at you with his cold gaze. </p><p><i>He surely hates you even more than he did. Yay! </i></p></p>",

Sweat slowly dripping from your  forehead making you feel disgusted and filthy. Your throat dry \u2014 in desperate need of water. So you do it again. Trying to move your hips without any music seems really embarrassing, especially for you. Feeling his eyes watching your every move makes you stiff. \u201cGod, Y/N. You\u2019re useless.\u201d His sharp words causes a sharp pain in your heart. </p><p>You exhale the long breath you\u2019ve been holding up, trying to calm yourself down. Simply standing up from your position, you walk to your bag full of your stuff picking up the untouched water bottle. He wouldn\u2019t even let you drink one drop, since you came here. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d His voice booms once again. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The water makes your throat feel more relaxed \u2014 no more dry. Closing the bottle up and tossing it back on the ground, you look into his eyes. His stern look almost makes you feel obedient once again, but this time you slowly compose your posture. \u201cDrinking? I\u2019ve been probably dehydrated this whole time.\u201d You speak with venom in your voice. </p><p>Not once, you\u2019ve raised your voice on him. You\u2019ve been respecting him ever since he started to teach you. The sunshine you met for the first time isn\u2019t the same guy, who is standing couple of meters behind you. Still remembering his red hair and wide smile welcoming you and few girls in this exact same practice room. His body shined with happiness and positivity. He looks like complete opposite right now. His brows furrowed while looking at you as if you\u2019ve stolen something from his. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve done your work, maybe you could have some rest.\u201d </p><p>Automatic snort comes from your lips, head shaking unbelievably. This is only your third class and you already think that this wasn\u2019t such a good idea. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re done here.\u201d He huffs looking at the Rolex watch on his wrist. He picks his sport bag from the floor, ready to leave. You can see the clock on the wall showing it\u2019s already 9pm \u2014 your class has ended. You pack your stuff when you hear annoyed sigh. Looking up at Hoseok, who is looking at you \u2014 annoyed. <i>Surprise! </i>He jiggles with the keys in his hand telling you silently, that he\u2019s supposed to lock up this practice room. You fasten up your stuff, mumbling soft \u2018sorry\u2019. Not sure if he heard you, you aren\u2019t expecting any answer anyway. </p><p>Tossing your sport bag over your shoulder you quickly leave from the practice room. You can hear him locking it and soon his footsteps behind you. Uncomfortable wind splashes to your face as soon as you come out of the building. You should\u2019ve wear something warmer than sweatpants, short sleeve T-shirt and thin sweater. It was supposed to be warm. Hoseok walks right pass you to his car without any goodbye. You watch him turning on engine and leaving from the parking lot \u2014 leaving you there standing in front of the building with crazy wind. <i>Jerk. He could\u2019ve ask you if you needed a ride home. </i>He even went in the same direction! </p><hr><p>\u201cHe is such a jerk!\u201d You exclaim to Namjoon, your brows furrowed with little pout on your lips. Of course, you had to complain to your best friend as soon as you could. \u201cHe left without asking me if I need a ride! It was freezing!\u201d You say dramatically, sounding maybe too angry. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s there to teach you, not to be all sweet to you.\u201d He shrugs before he continues slurping on his ramen. You huff watching his cheeks full of noodles. </p><p>\u201cYeah, well at least he doesn\u2019t have to be rude.\u201d You mumble annoyed, thinking about what happened the other night. It still makes you so annoyed and angry at him. His attitude is absolutely impolite and he shouldn\u2019t be treating you like that. The most confusing thing about it is \u2014 when you first met him he really was such a sweetheart. </p><p>You still remember going into the practice room to have a look on his dance class \u2014 making sure you really want to be a part of it. You remember him standing in front of the mirror showing you and other girls basic dance moves. Everyone was so quiet back there \u2014 all of your attention on him. He moved his body so naturally like everything he knows is how to dance. He looked so professional only focused on dancing \u2014 like ten girls aren\u2019t watching him. He didn\u2019t pay any attention to any of you. When music stopped, his serious behavior disappeared and cheerful himself was back. He greeted every each one of you, while everyone bowed their heads. Shaking your hands with bright smile. His professional dancing made you realize \u2014 he\u2019s the one. He\u2019s the one who is supposed to teach you how to dance. So you agreed to have classes with him. His price list wasn\u2019t really cheap, but when you saw his dancing\u2026 well, you\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s worth it. He is really good at what he\u2019s doing. </p><p>You remember your first class. He greeted you with small smile, he kept his attitude mostly neutral. Showing you all the right moves, explaining everything you\u2019ve done wrong. He was professional from the very start but now \u2014 he\u2019s too professional. He\u2019s so hard on you making you think he doesn\u2019t like you. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought about dropping?\u201d Namjoon pulls you out of your thoughts. </p><p>\u201cDropping what?\u201d You ask dumbfounded, noticing he finished his food \u2014 empty bowl in front of him and little bit sauce in the corner of his lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve little sauce here.\u201d You say pointing at his lips. </p><p>He awkwardly kisses his teeth, before quickly wiping it off in the reflection of the spoon beside him.<i> This guy. </i>He coughs adverting his attention back to you. \u201cThe class. Why don\u2019t you find someone else for dancing?\u201d He asked you simply. </p><p><i>He\u2019s right. </i>But unfortunately \u2014 Hoseok is probably the best dancer in your area. You can\u2019t probably find anyone that good. And you say the exact same thing to Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you find something else to keep you active then? Maybe swimming?\u201d He tries again. </p><p>\u201cJoon,\u201d You whine. \u201cYou know why I\u2019m doing this.\u201d</p><p>You know that you\u2019re not the best dancer, but you got the moves. You\u2019re still not completely confident in dancing in front of people, but you still try your best. Your decision to dancing is simple \u2014 you weren\u2019t confident with your body, so you decided to do something more active. You don\u2019t consider yourself as dancer, but more like someone who likes to dance and try to learn something about it. Plus, your family members calling you \u2018fat\u2019 and saying stuff like \u2018you got bigger\u2019 to you, didn\u2019t really help your confidence. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve decided to do this. You keep yourself occupied and active. It isn\u2019t for the looks anymore, more like you feel more healthier because you are more active. Watching movies all day while eating ramen and other not really healthy food wasn\u2019t really good and <i>healthy</i> idea.</p><p>\u201cYou can go hiking with me. Plus the nature is beautiful, you\u2019d love that.\u201d He suggests with cheerful gaze. He loves walking in the nature and the fresh air. He always shows you the pictures he takes, spending hours talking about how beautiful our nature is. You promised him that you\u2019d go with him sometimes. But your work and now dancing class don\u2019t really allow you that. Your exhaustion taking over as soon as you come home. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could do that twice a week. Dancing is perfect. Just Hoseok isn\u2019t.\u201d You grumble quietly, already fearing he\u2019s somewhere nearby waiting to snap at you. </p><p>You not knowing he isn\u2019t now \u2014 but he is on your next class. </p><hr><p>\u201cThank you, Hoseok! I can\u2019t wait for our next class.\u201d You hear girly voice before the practice door are opened. The girl, Seulgi, you believe comes out with bright smile waving before closing the door. You don\u2019t really know her but you\u2019ve spoke to her couple of times. She usually has her dance class before yours, so the two of you met often. \u201cOh, hey!\u201d She says when she sees you sitting on one of the chairs in front of the practice room.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d You greet her with kind smile giving her little wave. </p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you early?\u201d She asks you checking the time on her phone.</p><p>In fact, you really are early. After you and Namjoon went separate ways, you had nowhere else to go. So you got here little bit earlier \u2014 knowing Hoseok has fifteen minutes break. \u201cYeah,\u201d You nod. \u201cHow was the class?\u201d </p><p>Her smile widens even more. \u201cIt was amazing. Hoseok really is the best dancer here.\u201d She says with almost too enthusiasm and it makes your eyebrow twitch. </p><p>Well, you know he\u2019s the best dancer here. But that part about \u2018it was amazing\u2019 makes you slightly irritated. Is only your class so bad? \u201cHow\u2019s your class?\u201d She asks completely oblivious to your slightly irritated behavior. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 good.\u201d You say unconvincingly with fake smile. </p><p>She eyes you strangely, opening her mouth ready to say something when another voice stops her. Your eyes finding Namjoon calling your name waving his hands in the distance. </p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d You ask standing up seeing breathless Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cYou forgot your lunch, moron.\u201d He tells you, the packed lunch in his hands. </p><p>Sudden realization washes over you. You were so irritated with Hoseok and thinking about your class, that you completely forgot to take it from the convenience store. \u201cOh my god! Thank you!\u201d You say with wide mouth taking the lunch from his hands. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He shrugs patting your head like you\u2019re some kid, making you roll your eyes. You see Seulgi waving her hand as goodbye, not wanting to interrupt you. You just wave her back, not really wanting to talk to her. Thinking about how she had something to say about your answer. </p><p>You don\u2019t really want to explain to her, how you really feel about Hoseok. Both of your heads snaps to the door which opens widely \u2014 Hoseok standing there watching you with raised eyebrow. You stare each other, until Hoseok inhales annoyingly. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our class.\u201d </p><p><i>Already?</i></p><p>\u201cThank you, again.\u201d You thank Namjoon for the last time, him giving you small smile in return. \u201cBye, Joon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d He slowly waves, Hoseok turning around with his back to both of you. </p><p>You mouth \u2018help me\u2019 at Namjoon and he gives you thumbs up. You see him turn around and leaving, while you go after Hoseok. You toss your sport bag to your usual spot, already preparing water bottle not caring what he thinks about it. If you\u2019re freaking thirsty, then you\u2019ll drink from it. You put your phone on silence, already knowing how Hoseok hates it. On your second class, your phone started to ring and then he became even more annoyed and irritated with you. You don\u2019t want him to hate you even more than he does now. You see the time on your phone, brows furrowed when you realize you had still time for your class to begin. He is suppose to have a break time. </p><p>\u201cDid you practice at home?\u201d He asks you already setting the speakers. </p><p>When you don\u2019t answer him, he turns back to you. You can see him wearing baby pink sweatpants, which are really looking great on him. Not many men can pull of pink color \u2014 Hoseok not being one of them. Simple white T-shirt covering his torso, but you can still see the outlines of his abs. You gulp shifting your gaze at his face. \u201cYes?\u201d You answer more in question making him stand up.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t practice?\u201d He asks you with loud voice. His voice already echoing throughout the room once again. Not liking his tone of voice, you bit your lip in nervousness. Even though you\u2019re not appreciating his attitude to you, you\u2019re still quiet. Some part of you is scared of him. He\u2019s really scary when he\u2019s angry or even only irritated. </p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve practice?\u201d You ask almost too quickly and his face is basically red as soon as those words pass your lips. </p><p>He smacks his phone onto the small table in the corner with loud smack, making you gulp nervously. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to practice but you have time to hangout with your boyfriend?\u201d He asks lowly, almost too normal making him look even scarier. </p><p>You see little vein popping on his neck \u2014 the view hot and scary at the same time. You should feel scared but when sudden throb between your legs awakens you, you want to almost laugh. <i>Are you really getting turned on by Hoseok\u2019s attitude?</i></p><p>You ignore that \u2018boyfriend\u2019 part, not really getting what he means. Does he think Namjoon is your boyfriend? Yet again, you want to laugh. But you don\u2019t. You keep your neutral gaze too scared to look away. \u201cVery well, then.\u201d He speaks turning around again. </p><p>You\u2019re watching his broad shoulders and masculine back, as he shuffles through different songs. The song completely unfamiliar to you, starts playing. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d You hear him say already standing in the middle of the room waiting for you to come there. The annoying look that you\u2019re not already there \u2014 dominating his face. <i>Great. Just Great. </i></p><p>He shows you a few moves which he wants you to learn this time. You watch his every move carefully trying to remember the small \u2018choreography\u2019. \u201cThis is supposed to be danced by two people, but as you have just seen it\u2019s possible to dance it just on your own.\u201d He explains pausing the music. </p><p>The moves aren\u2019t hard itself, but maybe it\u2019s because Hoseok made it look super easy. Another confirmation for you to know, that he truly is the master of what he\u2019s doing. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it toghether since I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll do it by yourself. You need guidance.\u201d</p><p><i>Did he just insult you while being professional? </i></p><p>You ignore his little jab at you, only nodding in return. You\u2019re not really in the mood for fighting, not like you\u2019d fight him. The only time you\u2019ve really talked back to him was about that water bottle. <i>How stupid, right?</i></p><p>\u201cDo you remember any part of it?\u201d He asks you.</p><p>What you\u2019re supposed to tell him? You\u2019ve remembered some little parts, but you know that\u2019s not enough for him. Without waiting for your response he turns to the mirror. \u201cCome here.\u201d He says motioning with his hands for you to come there.</p><p>You get there really quickly not wanting him to be pissed off this whole hour. \u201cYou\u2019ll just mimic my moves. You\u2019ll get the hang of it when we start to dance. At least I hope so.\u201d He mumbles the last part more for himself, but you still hear him. Annoyance rushing over your blood making you want to slap him. <i>How fucking rude!</i></p><p>He starts the music waiting for the beat drop. Standing right beside him you look at yourself in the mirror. Your cheeks are already flushed and you haven\u2019t even started. He starts moving, you quickly copying his every move. You have to admit \u2014 your moves aren\u2019t that bad. Hoseok makes you feel, like you can\u2019t dance at all. Not the fact, that obviously \u2014 he\u2019s the best dancer you\u2019ve ever seen. But more like, his constant comments and insults your way makes you think, that you\u2019re not good enough. </p><p>The whole \u2018choreography\u2019 lasts only like for two minutes. He pauses the music, putting his phone back on the floor. \u201cIt was\u2026 okay.\u201d He speaks, fingers rushing over his red hair. </p><p><i>Okay? </i>You thought you danced amazing! You hit every beat and the fact that you remembered the whole choreography by only just looking at him, is kind of impressive. </p><p>Almost rolling your eyes, you catch yourself before you can. \u201cBut it was still empty. It was just like two persons dancing beside each other.\u201d</p><p><i>Isn\u2019t that what you were doing? Dancing beside each other?</i></p><p>Then you remember his words. It was supposed to be dancing with each other. Not beside each other. Suddenly getting his words you nod understandably. </p><p>\u201cWe will continue to do the same thing, but we will touch each other so it looks more naturally. Just let the music and me move you.\u201d He says before bending to his phone, starting the song again. </p><p>You flinch little bit when his fingers touch your hand, leaving goosebumps there. He pulls you closer to his body, heat radiating from him. You\u2019re almost leaning against his hard chest, when he starts moving you to the beat. It looks and feels hard from the start, but Hoseok\u2019s moving your body like you\u2019ve no control over it. You quickly start to dance the moves exactly how you remember. It was the move when you were about to go left, but you turn right. Bumping your head right into Hoseok\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He yelps touching his nose with scrunched face.</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d You\u2019re quick to put hand onto your mouth and telling apologizes over and over again. </p><p>Your head hurts little bit, so you don\u2019t even want to know how Hoseok\u2019s nose feels right now. \u201cTurn the fucking music off!\u201d He snaps, hand still on his nose making his voice sounding muffled. You\u2019re quick to run to his phone, turning the music off just how he asked. Well, not really asked. More like commanded. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Hoseok. Does it hurt too much?\u201d You ask with concern trying to see his nose. </p><p>\u201cNo, I yelped just for fun. Of course it hurts.\u201d He spits at you, closing his eyes trying to relief some pain. </p><p>You don\u2019t really pay attention to his rudeness, because you really feel sorry. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do that. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You apologize once again with guilt all over your face. </p><p>Hoseok doesn\u2019t spare you one glance, walking closer to the mirror. He takes his hand off from his nose, looking at his bloody nose. <i>Shit! </i>You made him bleed. It\u2019s not something drastic\u2026 but still. </p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d You ask carefully not really want to piss him off even more. </p><p>\u201cLearn how to dance, maybe?\u201d</p><p><i>You deserved it, you jerk! </i>You\u2019re ready to yell but you bite your tongue. The whole situation becoming somehow funny and it amuses you. </p><p>\u201cAre you fucking smirking at me?\u201d He asks, drop of blood dripping from his nose. He\u2019s quick to wipe it with his finger.</p><p>You immediately widen your mouth realizing that \u2014 in fact, you were. \u201cNo!\u201d You deny shaking his head.</p><p>He huffs annoyingly turning around, not wanting to piss himself even more. He shuffles in his bag pulling out tissues. He wipes his nose biting his tongue to prevent him from hissing. <i>It fucking hurts! </i>The tissue is red from blood almost immediately. It looks terrifying even though you don\u2019t have hemophobia. </p><p>An idea pops in your head, quickly scurrying to your bad finding a wallet. You run out of the practice room to the small buffet which should be closing up any minute. </p><p>\u201cDo you have anything cold, please?\u201d You asks hurriedly, the old lady raising one brow. </p><p>\u201cFrozen peas?\u201d She asks already pulling it out from the freezer. </p><p>It\u2019s your turn to raise one brow. \u201cWhy do you have frozen peas?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say, there\u2019re a lot of accidents here.\u201d She explains, making you nod. </p><p>You pay quickly, bowing your head already running back to Hoseok. You find him sitting on the floor while leaning against the wall, his head thrown back. \u201cHere.\u201d You say handing him the package of frozen peas.</p><p>He looks up \u2014 confusion written in his expression. \u201cWhere would you got this?\u201d He asks but still taking it from you, gently putting it on his nose. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d You simple shrug. You stand there for awhile after he puts the package on the floor \u2014 tearing a piece of the tissue stuffing it into his nose. \u201cDoes it still hurt so much?\u201d You ask softly, not wanting him to be mad. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better now.\u201d He mumbles.</p><p>You can do nothing more than just awkwardly stand there. And as fast as your class began, it ended as well. </p><hr><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Namjoon screeches when you tell him about the accident \u2014 accidentally making Hoseok\u2019s nose bleed. His laugh literally going \u2018HAHAHAH\u2019 fills the whole car making you cringed at the loud sound. Let\u2019s say, you barely slept throughout the night. Catching up the work you\u2019re supposed to have done by today. You did it, you just had to be up almost all night. It\u2019s raining the whole day and your mood suddenly falls, the weather making your day worse. Plus, it\u2019s your dancing class again. You haven\u2019t seen Hoseok since the accident. He told you to go home and you obeyed gladly. Embarrassment filling your whole body and you\u2019d be really happy, if you could say it felt. It didn\u2019t. You want to hide and never show up to his classes ever again, but then you\u2019d just be a coward. Your mom always taught you to face your problems \u2014 now it\u2019s time. </p><p>Thankfully Namjoon stopped by your apartment for a second and asked you if you want a ride. You\u2019d usually bother him and walk there, but because of the weather is pretty much awful \u2014 you said yes. So he\u2019s driving you there.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing.\u201d You say but start to laugh yourself. <i>God, you\u2019re so embarrassed but it\u2019s funny at the same time. </i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so clumsy.\u201d He comments already turning to the direction of the building. </p><p>\u201cYeah? And you\u2019re not? You eat like little kid and always somehow gets your clothes dirty because of it. And I don\u2019t know who always stumbles even though the sidewalk is flat.\u201d You comment back making him stop laughing.</p><p>\u201cHey, I never said I\u2019m not.\u201d He defends himself with slight chuckle, making you chuckle back. </p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019re both clumsy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re more clumsy than me. You punched someone in the nose because of your clumsiness.\u201d He says jokingly making you snort.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly punch him. I just\u2026\u201d You trailed off not really knowing how to explain it. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I get.\u201d Namjoon sways his hand at you annoyingly. He\u2019s probably happy that he isn\u2019t the only one with really embarrassing story now. </p><p>He parks in front of the building. You thank him for the drive telling him you\u2019ll treat him with some ramen, which he politely declines. As soon as you step out of the car, you quickly run inside. Rain wetting your clothes in the process. You wave at Namjoon last time before disappearing inside. </p><p>Already having your sports clothes on \u2014 black leggings with white tank top and nice puma trainers \u2014 spare you a time of changing your clothes. You always does this. You come in your sports clothes and then when you\u2019re done, you simply change to your casual clothes. Thanks to the lockers in the practice room. </p><p>You sit inside of the practice room \u2014checking the time before you did, of course \u2014 but stopping when you see someone else in the room. There\u2019s Hoseok with beanie covering his hair wearing his casual clothes, but in different colors this time. His sweatpants, T-shirt and trainers are all black. Well, he definitely looks good in everything. But beside him is someone else \u2014 guy looking slightly younger than Hoseok. \u201cAm I too early?\u201d You ask, nervously clutching the strap of your sport bag. </p><p>You catch their attention, their heads turning to you. Hoseok rolling his eyes off while turning back to the guy. It looks like he wanted to be discreet, but you still saw him. <i>Jerk.</i></p><p>\u201cIs this the girl who punched you?\u201d The guy asks with loud laughter, showing his bunny smile and scrunched nose. <i>He is cute. </i>You come inside, the door shutting by itself. </p><p>You almost laugh with him, but catching yourself just in time not to. Hoseok gives him nasty glare ready to throw some insult his way, when there\u2019s a knock. The door opens slowly, Namjoon blonde head peeking out. </p><p>\u201cJoon?\u201d You ask surprised, his eyes meeting yours. </p><p>\u201cHey, sorry. Didn\u2019t want to interrupt but I forgot to give you this.\u201d He explains handing you dark blue umbrella with colorful little crabs all over it. \u201cIt might be raining when you go home. I\u2019d pick you up but I\u2019ve to go to help mom.\u201d He explains more, making you smile at him. </p><p>You take the umbrella from his hand. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d You thank him. The both guys simply staring at you in silence. </p><p>His eyes gazing over them, before quickly saying; \u201cSee you later.\u201d And he left just as quick as that. You didn\u2019t even give him a proper goodbye. </p><p>When turning around, you figured why he left so quickly. Hoseok intimidating and sharp gaze looking at you. \u201cHow\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d He asks bitterly, voice filled with mockery and irritation. You don\u2019t even bother to correct him. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your nose?\u201d You ask back, before you can stop yourself. You\u2019re kind of glad that you didn\u2019t.</p><p>The guy beside him bursts in laughter once again, while the two of you are having staring contest. </p><p>\u201cShit, I already love her!\u201d The guy says enthusiastically walking pass Hoseok, bumping into him little bit in the process, before coming to you. \u201cI\u2019m Jungguk. Hoseok\u2019s friend,\u201d He says with bunny smile already stretching his hand to you. You slowly take it, him looking back at Hoseok who gives him cold stare. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not so sure anymore. He\u2019s intimidated when he\u2019s pissed.\u201d He whispers to you, making you giggle. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d You introduce yourself with polite smile. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really want to talk to you some more, but your class already started and I have to go as well,\u201d He says and pouts fakily, making him look even cuter. \u201cI\u2019m teaching boxing, so if you\u2019d really want to learn boxing you know where to go,\u201d He smirks little bit making you blush. You\u2019ve never really seen so many handsome guys all at once. \u201cBut I think you already know how to throw a punch.\u201d He says grinning cheekily at Hoseok. </p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d He snaps in response, but Jungguk is basically sprinting out of the practice room.</p><p>\u201cLove you, hyung! Bye Y/N!\u201d He yells but before any of you can response, he\u2019s gone. </p><p>\u201cFucking brat.\u201d You hear Hoseok mumble and you look at him. His nose looks fine like it was never punched before. He catches your stare looking at you with his cold gaze. </p><p><i>He surely hates you even more than he did. Yay! </i></p></p>",

Sweat slowly dripping from your  forehead making you feel disgusted and filthy. Your throat dry &mdash; in desperate need of water. So you do it again. Trying to move your hips without any music seems really embarrassing, especially for you. Feeling his eyes watching your every move makes you stiff. &ldquo;God, Y/N. You&rsquo;re useless.&rdquo; His sharp words causes a sharp pain in your heart. </p><p>You exhale the long breath you&rsquo;ve been holding up, trying to calm yourself down. Simply standing up from your position, you walk to your bag full of your stuff picking up the untouched water bottle. He wouldn&rsquo;t even let you drink one drop, since you came here. &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; His voice booms once again. </p><p>The water makes your throat feel more relaxed &mdash; no more dry. Closing the bottle up and tossing it back on the ground, you look into his eyes. His stern look almost makes you feel obedient once again, but this time you slowly compose your posture. &ldquo;Drinking? I&rsquo;ve been probably dehydrated this whole time.&rdquo; You speak with venom in your voice. </p><p>Not once, you&rsquo;ve raised your voice on him. You&rsquo;ve been respecting him ever since he started to teach you. The sunshine you met for the first time isn&rsquo;t the same guy, who is standing couple of meters behind you. Still remembering his red hair and wide smile welcoming you and few girls in this exact same practice room. His body shined with happiness and positivity. He looks like complete opposite right now. His brows furrowed while looking at you as if you&rsquo;ve stolen something from his. &ldquo;If you would&rsquo;ve done your work, maybe you could have some rest.&rdquo; </p><p>Automatic snort comes from your lips, head shaking unbelievably. This is only your third class and you already think that this wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;re done here.&rdquo; He huffs looking at the Rolex watch on his wrist. He picks his sport bag from the floor, ready to leave. You can see the clock on the wall showing it&rsquo;s already 9pm &mdash; your class has ended. You pack your stuff when you hear annoyed sigh. Looking up at Hoseok, who is looking at you &mdash; annoyed. <i>Surprise! </i>He jiggles with the keys in his hand telling you silently, that he&rsquo;s supposed to lock up this practice room. You fasten up your stuff, mumbling soft &lsquo;sorry&rsquo;. Not sure if he heard you, you aren&rsquo;t expecting any answer anyway. </p><p>Tossing your sport bag over your shoulder you quickly leave from the practice room. You can hear him locking it and soon his footsteps behind you. Uncomfortable wind splashes to your face as soon as you come out of the building. You should&rsquo;ve wear something warmer than sweatpants, short sleeve T-shirt and thin sweater. It was supposed to be warm. Hoseok walks right pass you to his car without any goodbye. You watch him turning on engine and leaving from the parking lot &mdash; leaving you there standing in front of the building with crazy wind. <i>Jerk. He could&rsquo;ve ask you if you needed a ride home. </i>He even went in the same direction! </p><hr /><p>&ldquo;He is such a jerk!&rdquo; You exclaim to Namjoon, your brows furrowed with little pout on your lips. Of course, you had to complain to your best friend as soon as you could. &ldquo;He left without asking me if I need a ride! It was freezing!&rdquo; You say dramatically, sounding maybe too angry. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there to teach you, not to be all sweet to you.&rdquo; He shrugs before he continues slurping on his ramen. You huff watching his cheeks full of noodles. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well at least he doesn&rsquo;t have to be rude.&rdquo; You mumble annoyed, thinking about what happened the other night. It still makes you so annoyed and angry at him. His attitude is absolutely impolite and he shouldn&rsquo;t be treating you like that. The most confusing thing about it is &mdash; when you first met him he really was such a sweetheart. </p><p>You still remember going into the practice room to have a look on his dance class &mdash; making sure you really want to be a part of it. You remember him standing in front of the mirror showing you and other girls basic dance moves. Everyone was so quiet back there &mdash; all of your attention on him. He moved his body so naturally like everything he knows is how to dance. He looked so professional only focused on dancing &mdash; like ten girls aren&rsquo;t watching him. He didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to any of you. When music stopped, his serious behavior disappeared and cheerful himself was back. He greeted every each one of you, while everyone bowed their heads. Shaking your hands with bright smile. His professional dancing made you realize &mdash; he&rsquo;s the one. He&rsquo;s the one who is supposed to teach you how to dance. So you agreed to have classes with him. His price list wasn&rsquo;t really cheap, but when you saw his dancing&hellip; well, you&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s worth it. He is really good at what he&rsquo;s doing. </p><p>You remember your first class. He greeted you with small smile, he kept his attitude mostly neutral. Showing you all the right moves, explaining everything you&rsquo;ve done wrong. He was professional from the very start but now &mdash; he&rsquo;s too professional. He&rsquo;s so hard on you making you think he doesn&rsquo;t like you. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you thought about dropping?&rdquo; Namjoon pulls you out of your thoughts. </p><p>&ldquo;Dropping what?&rdquo; You ask dumbfounded, noticing he finished his food &mdash; empty bowl in front of him and little bit sauce in the corner of his lips. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve little sauce here.&rdquo; You say pointing at his lips. </p><p>He awkwardly kisses his teeth, before quickly wiping it off in the reflection of the spoon beside him.<i> This guy. </i>He coughs adverting his attention back to you. &ldquo;The class. Why don&rsquo;t you find someone else for dancing?&rdquo; He asked you simply. </p><p><i>He&rsquo;s right. </i>But unfortunately &mdash; Hoseok is probably the best dancer in your area. You can&rsquo;t probably find anyone that good. And you say the exact same thing to Namjoon. </p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you find something else to keep you active then? Maybe swimming?&rdquo; He tries again. </p><p>&ldquo;Joon,&rdquo; You whine. &ldquo;You know why I&rsquo;m doing this.&rdquo;</p><p>You know that you&rsquo;re not the best dancer, but you got the moves. You&rsquo;re still not completely confident in dancing in front of people, but you still try your best. Your decision to dancing is simple &mdash; you weren&rsquo;t confident with your body, so you decided to do something more active. You don&rsquo;t consider yourself as dancer, but more like someone who likes to dance and try to learn something about it. Plus, your family members calling you &lsquo;fat&rsquo; and saying stuff like &lsquo;you got bigger&rsquo; to you, didn&rsquo;t really help your confidence. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve decided to do this. You keep yourself occupied and active. It isn&rsquo;t for the looks anymore, more like you feel more healthier because you are more active. Watching movies all day while eating ramen and other not really healthy food wasn&rsquo;t really good and <i>healthy</i> idea.</p><p>&ldquo;You can go hiking with me. Plus the nature is beautiful, you&rsquo;d love that.&rdquo; He suggests with cheerful gaze. He loves walking in the nature and the fresh air. He always shows you the pictures he takes, spending hours talking about how beautiful our nature is. You promised him that you&rsquo;d go with him sometimes. But your work and now dancing class don&rsquo;t really allow you that. Your exhaustion taking over as soon as you come home. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could do that twice a week. Dancing is perfect. Just Hoseok isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You grumble quietly, already fearing he&rsquo;s somewhere nearby waiting to snap at you. </p><p>You not knowing he isn&rsquo;t now &mdash; but he is on your next class. </p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Hoseok! I can&rsquo;t wait for our next class.&rdquo; You hear girly voice before the practice door are opened. The girl, Seulgi, you believe comes out with bright smile waving before closing the door. You don&rsquo;t really know her but you&rsquo;ve spoke to her couple of times. She usually has her dance class before yours, so the two of you met often. &ldquo;Oh, hey!&rdquo; She says when she sees you sitting on one of the chairs in front of the practice room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; You greet her with kind smile giving her little wave. </p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you early?&rdquo; She asks you checking the time on her phone.</p><p>In fact, you really are early. After you and Namjoon went separate ways, you had nowhere else to go. So you got here little bit earlier &mdash; knowing Hoseok has fifteen minutes break. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; You nod. &ldquo;How was the class?&rdquo; </p><p>Her smile widens even more. &ldquo;It was amazing. Hoseok really is the best dancer here.&rdquo; She says with almost too enthusiasm and it makes your eyebrow twitch. </p><p>Well, you know he&rsquo;s the best dancer here. But that part about &lsquo;it was amazing&rsquo; makes you slightly irritated. Is only your class so bad? &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your class?&rdquo; She asks completely oblivious to your slightly irritated behavior. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; good.&rdquo; You say unconvincingly with fake smile. </p><p>She eyes you strangely, opening her mouth ready to say something when another voice stops her. Your eyes finding Namjoon calling your name waving his hands in the distance. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what are you doing here?&rdquo; You ask standing up seeing breathless Namjoon. </p><p>&ldquo;You forgot your lunch, moron.&rdquo; He tells you, the packed lunch in his hands. </p><p>Sudden realization washes over you. You were so irritated with Hoseok and thinking about your class, that you completely forgot to take it from the convenience store. &ldquo;Oh my god! Thank you!&rdquo; You say with wide mouth taking the lunch from his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; He shrugs patting your head like you&rsquo;re some kid, making you roll your eyes. You see Seulgi waving her hand as goodbye, not wanting to interrupt you. You just wave her back, not really wanting to talk to her. Thinking about how she had something to say about your answer. </p><p>You don&rsquo;t really want to explain to her, how you really feel about Hoseok. Both of your heads snaps to the door which opens widely &mdash; Hoseok standing there watching you with raised eyebrow. You stare each other, until Hoseok inhales annoyingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for our class.&rdquo; </p><p><i>Already?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, again.&rdquo; You thank Namjoon for the last time, him giving you small smile in return. &ldquo;Bye, Joon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo; He slowly waves, Hoseok turning around with his back to both of you. </p><p>You mouth &lsquo;help me&rsquo; at Namjoon and he gives you thumbs up. You see him turn around and leaving, while you go after Hoseok. You toss your sport bag to your usual spot, already preparing water bottle not caring what he thinks about it. If you&rsquo;re freaking thirsty, then you&rsquo;ll drink from it. You put your phone on silence, already knowing how Hoseok hates it. On your second class, your phone started to ring and then he became even more annoyed and irritated with you. You don&rsquo;t want him to hate you even more than he does now. You see the time on your phone, brows furrowed when you realize you had still time for your class to begin. He is suppose to have a break time. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you practice at home?&rdquo; He asks you already setting the speakers. </p><p>When you don&rsquo;t answer him, he turns back to you. You can see him wearing baby pink sweatpants, which are really looking great on him. Not many men can pull of pink color &mdash; Hoseok not being one of them. Simple white T-shirt covering his torso, but you can still see the outlines of his abs. You gulp shifting your gaze at his face. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; You answer more in question making him stand up.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t practice?&rdquo; He asks you with loud voice. His voice already echoing throughout the room once again. Not liking his tone of voice, you bit your lip in nervousness. Even though you&rsquo;re not appreciating his attitude to you, you&rsquo;re still quiet. Some part of you is scared of him. He&rsquo;s really scary when he&rsquo;s angry or even only irritated. </p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve practice?&rdquo; You ask almost too quickly and his face is basically red as soon as those words pass your lips. </p><p>He smacks his phone onto the small table in the corner with loud smack, making you gulp nervously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have time to practice but you have time to hangout with your boyfriend?&rdquo; He asks lowly, almost too normal making him look even scarier. </p><p>You see little vein popping on his neck &mdash; the view hot and scary at the same time. You should feel scared but when sudden throb between your legs awakens you, you want to almost laugh. <i>Are you really getting turned on by Hoseok&rsquo;s attitude?</i></p><p>You ignore that &lsquo;boyfriend&rsquo; part, not really getting what he means. Does he think Namjoon is your boyfriend? Yet again, you want to laugh. But you don&rsquo;t. You keep your neutral gaze too scared to look away. &ldquo;Very well, then.&rdquo; He speaks turning around again. </p><p>You&rsquo;re watching his broad shoulders and masculine back, as he shuffles through different songs. The song completely unfamiliar to you, starts playing. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this over with.&rdquo; You hear him say already standing in the middle of the room waiting for you to come there. The annoying look that you&rsquo;re not already there &mdash; dominating his face. <i>Great. Just Great. </i></p><p>He shows you a few moves which he wants you to learn this time. You watch his every move carefully trying to remember the small &lsquo;choreography&rsquo;. &ldquo;This is supposed to be danced by two people, but as you have just seen it&rsquo;s possible to dance it just on your own.&rdquo; He explains pausing the music. </p><p>The moves aren&rsquo;t hard itself, but maybe it&rsquo;s because Hoseok made it look super easy. Another confirmation for you to know, that he truly is the master of what he&rsquo;s doing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it toghether since I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do it by yourself. You need guidance.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Did he just insult you while being professional? </i></p><p>You ignore his little jab at you, only nodding in return. You&rsquo;re not really in the mood for fighting, not like you&rsquo;d fight him. The only time you&rsquo;ve really talked back to him was about that water bottle. <i>How stupid, right?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember any part of it?&rdquo; He asks you.</p><p>What you&rsquo;re supposed to tell him? You&rsquo;ve remembered some little parts, but you know that&rsquo;s not enough for him. Without waiting for your response he turns to the mirror. &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; He says motioning with his hands for you to come there.</p><p>You get there really quickly not wanting him to be pissed off this whole hour. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just mimic my moves. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of it when we start to dance. At least I hope so.&rdquo; He mumbles the last part more for himself, but you still hear him. Annoyance rushing over your blood making you want to slap him. <i>How fucking rude!</i></p><p>He starts the music waiting for the beat drop. Standing right beside him you look at yourself in the mirror. Your cheeks are already flushed and you haven&rsquo;t even started. He starts moving, you quickly copying his every move. You have to admit &mdash; your moves aren&rsquo;t that bad. Hoseok makes you feel, like you can&rsquo;t dance at all. Not the fact, that obviously &mdash; he&rsquo;s the best dancer you&rsquo;ve ever seen. But more like, his constant comments and insults your way makes you think, that you&rsquo;re not good enough. </p><p>The whole &lsquo;choreography&rsquo; lasts only like for two minutes. He pauses the music, putting his phone back on the floor. &ldquo;It was&hellip; okay.&rdquo; He speaks, fingers rushing over his red hair. </p><p><i>Okay? </i>You thought you danced amazing! You hit every beat and the fact that you remembered the whole choreography by only just looking at him, is kind of impressive. </p><p>Almost rolling your eyes, you catch yourself before you can. &ldquo;But it was still empty. It was just like two persons dancing beside each other.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Isn&rsquo;t that what you were doing? Dancing beside each other?</i></p><p>Then you remember his words. It was supposed to be dancing with each other. Not beside each other. Suddenly getting his words you nod understandably. </p><p>&ldquo;We will continue to do the same thing, but we will touch each other so it looks more naturally. Just let the music and me move you.&rdquo; He says before bending to his phone, starting the song again. </p><p>You flinch little bit when his fingers touch your hand, leaving goosebumps there. He pulls you closer to his body, heat radiating from him. You&rsquo;re almost leaning against his hard chest, when he starts moving you to the beat. It looks and feels hard from the start, but Hoseok&rsquo;s moving your body like you&rsquo;ve no control over it. You quickly start to dance the moves exactly how you remember. It was the move when you were about to go left, but you turn right. Bumping your head right into Hoseok&rsquo;s face. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; He yelps touching his nose with scrunched face.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; You&rsquo;re quick to put hand onto your mouth and telling apologizes over and over again. </p><p>Your head hurts little bit, so you don&rsquo;t even want to know how Hoseok&rsquo;s nose feels right now. &ldquo;Turn the fucking music off!&rdquo; He snaps, hand still on his nose making his voice sounding muffled. You&rsquo;re quick to run to his phone, turning the music off just how he asked. Well, not really asked. More like commanded. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Hoseok. Does it hurt too much?&rdquo; You ask with concern trying to see his nose. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I yelped just for fun. Of course it hurts.&rdquo; He spits at you, closing his eyes trying to relief some pain. </p><p>You don&rsquo;t really pay attention to his rudeness, because you really feel sorry. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; You apologize once again with guilt all over your face. </p><p>Hoseok doesn&rsquo;t spare you one glance, walking closer to the mirror. He takes his hand off from his nose, looking at his bloody nose. <i>Shit! </i>You made him bleed. It&rsquo;s not something drastic&hellip; but still. </p><p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; You ask carefully not really want to piss him off even more. </p><p>&ldquo;Learn how to dance, maybe?&rdquo;</p><p><i>You deserved it, you jerk! </i>You&rsquo;re ready to yell but you bite your tongue. The whole situation becoming somehow funny and it amuses you. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you fucking smirking at me?&rdquo; He asks, drop of blood dripping from his nose. He&rsquo;s quick to wipe it with his finger.</p><p>You immediately widen your mouth realizing that &mdash; in fact, you were. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; You deny shaking his head.</p><p>He huffs annoyingly turning around, not wanting to piss himself even more. He shuffles in his bag pulling out tissues. He wipes his nose biting his tongue to prevent him from hissing. <i>It fucking hurts! </i>The tissue is red from blood almost immediately. It looks terrifying even though you don&rsquo;t have hemophobia. </p><p>An idea pops in your head, quickly scurrying to your bad finding a wallet. You run out of the practice room to the small buffet which should be closing up any minute. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you have anything cold, please?&rdquo; You asks hurriedly, the old lady raising one brow. </p><p>&ldquo;Frozen peas?&rdquo; She asks already pulling it out from the freezer. </p><p>It&rsquo;s your turn to raise one brow. &ldquo;Why do you have frozen peas?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say, there&rsquo;re a lot of accidents here.&rdquo; She explains, making you nod. </p><p>You pay quickly, bowing your head already running back to Hoseok. You find him sitting on the floor while leaning against the wall, his head thrown back. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo; You say handing him the package of frozen peas.</p><p>He looks up &mdash; confusion written in his expression. &ldquo;Where would you got this?&rdquo; He asks but still taking it from you, gently putting it on his nose. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo; You simple shrug. You stand there for awhile after he puts the package on the floor &mdash; tearing a piece of the tissue stuffing it into his nose. &ldquo;Does it still hurt so much?&rdquo; You ask softly, not wanting him to be mad. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better now.&rdquo; He mumbles.</p><p>You can do nothing more than just awkwardly stand there. And as fast as your class began, it ended as well. </p><hr /><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; Namjoon screeches when you tell him about the accident &mdash; accidentally making Hoseok&rsquo;s nose bleed. His laugh literally going &lsquo;HAHAHAH&rsquo; fills the whole car making you cringed at the loud sound. Let&rsquo;s say, you barely slept throughout the night. Catching up the work you&rsquo;re supposed to have done by today. You did it, you just had to be up almost all night. It&rsquo;s raining the whole day and your mood suddenly falls, the weather making your day worse. Plus, it&rsquo;s your dancing class again. You haven&rsquo;t seen Hoseok since the accident. He told you to go home and you obeyed gladly. Embarrassment filling your whole body and you&rsquo;d be really happy, if you could say it felt. It didn&rsquo;t. You want to hide and never show up to his classes ever again, but then you&rsquo;d just be a coward. Your mom always taught you to face your problems &mdash; now it&rsquo;s time. </p><p>Thankfully Namjoon stopped by your apartment for a second and asked you if you want a ride. You&rsquo;d usually bother him and walk there, but because of the weather is pretty much awful &mdash; you said yes. So he&rsquo;s driving you there.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop laughing.&rdquo; You say but start to laugh yourself. <i>God, you&rsquo;re so embarrassed but it&rsquo;s funny at the same time. </i></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so clumsy.&rdquo; He comments already turning to the direction of the building. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah? And you&rsquo;re not? You eat like little kid and always somehow gets your clothes dirty because of it. And I don&rsquo;t know who always stumbles even though the sidewalk is flat.&rdquo; You comment back making him stop laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I never said I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; He defends himself with slight chuckle, making you chuckle back. </p><p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;re both clumsy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I feel like you&rsquo;re more clumsy than me. You punched someone in the nose because of your clumsiness.&rdquo; He says jokingly making you snort.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly punch him. I just&hellip;&rdquo; You trailed off not really knowing how to explain it. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah I get.&rdquo; Namjoon sways his hand at you annoyingly. He&rsquo;s probably happy that he isn&rsquo;t the only one with really embarrassing story now. </p><p>He parks in front of the building. You thank him for the drive telling him you&rsquo;ll treat him with some ramen, which he politely declines. As soon as you step out of the car, you quickly run inside. Rain wetting your clothes in the process. You wave at Namjoon last time before disappearing inside. </p><p>Already having your sports clothes on &mdash; black leggings with white tank top and nice puma trainers &mdash; spare you a time of changing your clothes. You always does this. You come in your sports clothes and then when you&rsquo;re done, you simply change to your casual clothes. Thanks to the lockers in the practice room. </p><p>You sit inside of the practice room &mdash;checking the time before you did, of course &mdash; but stopping when you see someone else in the room. There&rsquo;s Hoseok with beanie covering his hair wearing his casual clothes, but in different colors this time. His sweatpants, T-shirt and trainers are all black. Well, he definitely looks good in everything. But beside him is someone else &mdash; guy looking slightly younger than Hoseok. &ldquo;Am I too early?&rdquo; You ask, nervously clutching the strap of your sport bag. </p><p>You catch their attention, their heads turning to you. Hoseok rolling his eyes off while turning back to the guy. It looks like he wanted to be discreet, but you still saw him. <i>Jerk.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Is this the girl who punched you?&rdquo; The guy asks with loud laughter, showing his bunny smile and scrunched nose. <i>He is cute. </i>You come inside, the door shutting by itself. </p><p>You almost laugh with him, but catching yourself just in time not to. Hoseok gives him nasty glare ready to throw some insult his way, when there&rsquo;s a knock. The door opens slowly, Namjoon blonde head peeking out. </p><p>&ldquo;Joon?&rdquo; You ask surprised, his eyes meeting yours. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sorry. Didn&rsquo;t want to interrupt but I forgot to give you this.&rdquo; He explains handing you dark blue umbrella with colorful little crabs all over it. &ldquo;It might be raining when you go home. I&rsquo;d pick you up but I&rsquo;ve to go to help mom.&rdquo; He explains more, making you smile at him. </p><p>You take the umbrella from his hand. &ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo; You thank him. The both guys simply staring at you in silence. </p><p>His eyes gazing over them, before quickly saying; &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo; And he left just as quick as that. You didn&rsquo;t even give him a proper goodbye. </p><p>When turning around, you figured why he left so quickly. Hoseok intimidating and sharp gaze looking at you. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your boyfriend?&rdquo; He asks bitterly, voice filled with mockery and irritation. You don&rsquo;t even bother to correct him. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your nose?&rdquo; You ask back, before you can stop yourself. You&rsquo;re kind of glad that you didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>The guy beside him bursts in laughter once again, while the two of you are having staring contest. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit, I already love her!&rdquo; The guy says enthusiastically walking pass Hoseok, bumping into him little bit in the process, before coming to you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jungguk. Hoseok&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; He says with bunny smile already stretching his hand to you. You slowly take it, him looking back at Hoseok who gives him cold stare. &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;m not so sure anymore. He&rsquo;s intimidated when he&rsquo;s pissed.&rdquo; He whispers to you, making you giggle. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N.&rdquo; You introduce yourself with polite smile. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really want to talk to you some more, but your class already started and I have to go as well,&rdquo; He says and pouts fakily, making him look even cuter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m teaching boxing, so if you&rsquo;d really want to learn boxing you know where to go,&rdquo; He smirks little bit making you blush. You&rsquo;ve never really seen so many handsome guys all at once. &ldquo;But I think you already know how to throw a punch.&rdquo; He says grinning cheekily at Hoseok. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off!&rdquo; He snaps in response, but Jungguk is basically sprinting out of the practice room.</p><p>&ldquo;Love you, hyung! Bye Y/N!&rdquo; He yells but before any of you can response, he&rsquo;s gone. </p><p>&ldquo;Fucking brat.&rdquo; You hear Hoseok mumble and you look at him. His nose looks fine like it was never punched before. He catches your stare looking at you with his cold gaze. </p><p><i>He surely hates you even more than he did. Yay! </i></p></p>",

Sweat slowly dripping from your  forehead making you feel disgusted and filthy. Your throat dry &mdash; in desperate need of water. So you do it again. Trying to move your hips without any music seems really embarrassing, especially for you. Feeling his eyes watching your every move makes you stiff. &ldquo;God, Y/N. You&rsquo;re useless.&rdquo; His sharp words causes a sharp pain in your heart. </p>\n<p>You exhale the long breath you&rsquo;ve been holding up, trying to calm yourself down. Simply standing up from your position, you walk to your bag full of your stuff picking up the untouched water bottle. He wouldn&rsquo;t even let you drink one drop, since you came here. &ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; His voice booms once again. </p>\n</p>",
