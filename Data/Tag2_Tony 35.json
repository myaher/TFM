Please, don\u2019t be offended by any of that, I adore every single house, I just think, that Tony\u2019s not a Slytherin.

I think it\u2019s very clear, it\u2019s his mind. He is a <i>genius</i>, we\u2019re all aware about it, right? Okay, two of the biggest qualities of a Ravenclaw is their intelligence and their wit. I think, I don\u2019t need to explain, why that fits.\u00a0</p><p>So, next there\u2019s the wisdom. Well, to be honest, I think Tony\u2019s smart as hell, but he\u2019s not wise. He does a lot of stupid and irrational things, and if you\u2019re going to ask him for an advice, he would probably give you a stupid one.\u00a0</p><p>Next one are creativity, originality and individuality. Okay, let\u2019s have a look at Iron Man 1. You\u2019ve been captured in a cave with nothing more than a box of scraps. You are forced to build a missile and you are connected to a car battery. Of course you are searching for a way to get out, but what are you gonna do? Try to escape through a tunnel? Try to knock out the guards? Build a weapon or a gun, to shoot your way out?</p><p>Not if you\u2019re Tony Stark. He built an armour, the first of its kind. Because he always has his own ways to do things. Always had. That\u2019s why Stark Industries always been so successful, why it was always on the top. Because Tony\u2019s always the first one doing things, he invented so many things, because of his creativity. He built the Iron Man suit all on his own. There\u2019s no one like him and there\u2019s nothing like his mind. Because he is original and individual and I can\u2019t imagine someone, who didn\u2019t see that.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an official Ravenclaw characteristic, but Pottermore and other websites talking about learning, so let\u2019s check that. This is a fast one, because Tony is always learning new stuff. Remember this scene? From Avengers (2012)?\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"cannonballonfire:ROnhaRvbBrv665NAuoojAQ:ZdemMX2gI_Eq3\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9bbe0aa4f1b6ea83cb7dfca89d4e34e/tumblr_pn1hyq525u1y66dqko1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"320\"/></figure><p>Yes, he became an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics over night.

Not mentioning how much he learned to get his PhDs.\u00a0</p><p>I know, the Harry Potter Wiki says there is another quality - acceptance. But I\u2019m not quit sure, what that\u2019s about, I\u2019m not a native english speaker, so if some of you could explain this to me, that would be great. But I think, everyone understands why I think, that Tony fits very good in Ravenclaw.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s get to the Slytherin part.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"565\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"jonnygordo:TG0gdhxQ3FiEXR7OTWxZLg:ZScX2f2JVmRrY\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fe998ff9c44d432a3751012182af357/tumblr_oms3mtp7QQ1w1sb9fo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"565\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>I totally understand, why people get Tony sorted into Slytherin. He has resourcefulness, absolutely. I don\u2019t think anyone can doubt that. And he is clever, no doubt here.\u00a0</p><p>I would give him the cunning one, although he got tricked by Maya Hansen in Iron Man 3. So I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s one of <i>the </i>characteristics of Tony, but I can see, why people are going for it, so that\u2019s okay.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Ambition and determination are the next ones, and to be honest? I don\u2019t fully agree to that. I mean, he can be ambitious and he can be determined, but I think for that, he gives up to easy sometimes. In Iron Man 2 he would\u2019ve died, if Fury, Phil and Nat didn\u2019t tell him to get up and do something. There are also a view hints in endgame, but I won\u2019t talk about that, because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything. So, I wouldn\u2019t say, ambition and determination are basic qualities of Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Fraternity is problematic. I won\u2019t say, Tony is a team player. I mean, yeah, he works with the avengers, but it took a while, to get him there. He was always more like a lone wolf, the only exception might be Rhodey. I wouldn&rsquo;t say he is very fraternal.\u00a0</p><p>Traditionalism is absolutely none of Tony\u2019s traits, and I don\u2019t think, I have to explain that. He invented a lot of new things, he changed the course of his whole industrie and he didn\u2019t care about traditions at all. Like christmas for example. I mean, did you saw a christmasy Tony in Iron Man 3? Like, the whole movie sets around christmas and I always forget this, because there are no signs. Tony is a very modern person, I\u2019m sure about that.\u00a0</p><p>Leadership quality. Well, no. I mean, he is good at co-leading, I have to give him that, at least with the avengers. But Tony himself said, that Steve is the boss and it was always Steve who lead the avengers. Because Tonys decisions are too irrational to actually lead things. He cares too little about important stuff, I mean, he was <i>not</i> a great CEO for Stark Industries, that\u2019s why he made Pepper CEO. <strike>And because she deserved it ofc.</strike>\u00a0He is not good at diplomacy and moreover, I doubt he wanted to lead anything. I think he doesn\u2019t care for something like that, which brings me to my next point.\u00a0</p><p>Pursuit of power. I know, that\u2019s not an official one, but it was available on Pottermore and they\u2019re websites, that have that on their lists. So, just wanted to say that power\u2019s nothing, that Tony ever wanted. He was one of the most powerful men on earth, still is, but he gave up on his CEO position. He never became Iron Man because he wanted power, he became Iron Man, because he wanted to do something <i>right.</i></p><p>And last but not least - self preservation. Well, nope, nope, nope.\u00a0</p><p>Remember the missile from Avengers (2012)?</p><p>Remember him giving up his life in Iron Man 2?\u00a0</p><p>Remember this avengers poster?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1521\" data-orig-width=\"1043\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c20b1f5b781eab9c882a30d1df9dd4a/tumblr_ps18btUqij1tsimb7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1521\" data-orig-width=\"1043\"/></figure><p>Tony always had a self-sacrificing side, he would always lay down on the wire and let the other guys crawl over him. Always. So I don\u2019t give him that.\u00a0</p><p>So, what does that say?</p><p>Tony totally has a few Slytherin traits, but mostly, he has almost <i>every</i>\u00a0Ravenclaw trait. And I think, the characteristic that pops up in your head, if you\u2019re thinking about Tony is his mind, his intelligence and his individuality. There will never be a second Iron Man. There will never be a second Tony Stark.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s why Tony Stark is a Ravenclaw.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"172\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"tonystarkstudies:O_2lJywl8iXGuretvWQMmA:ZkbKFk2YeMVqw\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b44afcd966a544d12bf7795a6ab1a108/tumblr_p9w3b0hgJF1uyufl6o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"172\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure>",

After that I\u2019m gonna explain, why I don\u2019t think, that Slytherin is the right house for him. Please, don\u2019t be offended by any of that, I adore every single house, I just think, that Tony\u2019s not a Slytherin. If that\u2019s still your opinion after all, that\u2019s absolutely fine.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"700\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"dorrianngray:sruDgJUCv20te_QpFrWCkQ:ZwYWPj2OTr-A1\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53b3aaa2c3449a48df3a1f9a8f10f8a0/tumblr_otyfnuO05g1ugj5gho1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"700\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure><p>Okay, what is the first thing you get in mind, when you think about Tony Stark? I think it\u2019s very clear, it\u2019s his mind. He is a <i>genius</i>, we\u2019re all aware about it, right? Okay, two of the biggest qualities of a Ravenclaw is their intelligence and their wit. I think, I don\u2019t need to explain, why that fits.\u00a0</p><p>So, next there\u2019s the wisdom. Well, to be honest, I think Tony\u2019s smart as hell, but he\u2019s not wise. He does a lot of stupid and irrational things, and if you\u2019re going to ask him for an advice, he would probably give you a stupid one.\u00a0</p><p>Next one are creativity, originality and individuality. Okay, let\u2019s have a look at Iron Man 1. You\u2019ve been captured in a cave with nothing more than a box of scraps. You are forced to build a missile and you are connected to a car battery. Of course you are searching for a way to get out, but what are you gonna do? Try to escape through a tunnel? Try to knock out the guards? Build a weapon or a gun, to shoot your way out?</p><p>Not if you\u2019re Tony Stark. He built an armour, the first of its kind. Because he always has his own ways to do things. Always had. That\u2019s why Stark Industries always been so successful, why it was always on the top. Because Tony\u2019s always the first one doing things, he invented so many things, because of his creativity. He built the Iron Man suit all on his own. There\u2019s no one like him and there\u2019s nothing like his mind. Because he is original and individual and I can\u2019t imagine someone, who didn\u2019t see that.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an official Ravenclaw characteristic, but Pottermore and other websites talking about learning, so let\u2019s check that. This is a fast one, because Tony is always learning new stuff. Remember this scene? From Avengers (2012)?\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"cannonballonfire:ROnhaRvbBrv665NAuoojAQ:ZdemMX2gI_Eq3\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9bbe0aa4f1b6ea83cb7dfca89d4e34e/tumblr_pn1hyq525u1y66dqko1_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"320\"></figure><p>Yes, he became an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics over night. Because he learned about it. Just as he learned about the arc-reactor and new elements in Iron Man 2, and a lots of other stuff. Not mentioning how much he learned to get his PhDs.\u00a0</p><p>I know, the Harry Potter Wiki says there is another quality - acceptance. But I\u2019m not quit sure, what that\u2019s about, I\u2019m not a native english speaker, so if some of you could explain this to me, that would be great. But I think, everyone understands why I think, that Tony fits very good in Ravenclaw.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s get to the Slytherin part.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"565\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"jonnygordo:TG0gdhxQ3FiEXR7OTWxZLg:ZScX2f2JVmRrY\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fe998ff9c44d432a3751012182af357/tumblr_oms3mtp7QQ1w1sb9fo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"565\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>I totally understand, why people get Tony sorted into Slytherin. He has resourcefulness, absolutely. I don\u2019t think anyone can doubt that. And he is clever, no doubt here.\u00a0</p><p>I would give him the cunning one, although he got tricked by Maya Hansen in Iron Man 3. So I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s one of <i>the </i>characteristics of Tony, but I can see, why people are going for it, so that\u2019s okay.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Ambition and determination are the next ones, and to be honest? I don\u2019t fully agree to that. I mean, he can be ambitious and he can be determined, but I think for that, he gives up to easy sometimes. In Iron Man 2 he would\u2019ve died, if Fury, Phil and Nat didn\u2019t tell him to get up and do something. There are also a view hints in endgame, but I won\u2019t talk about that, because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything. So, I wouldn\u2019t say, ambition and determination are basic qualities of Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Fraternity is problematic. I won\u2019t say, Tony is a team player. I mean, yeah, he works with the avengers, but it took a while, to get him there. He was always more like a lone wolf, the only exception might be Rhodey. I wouldn\u2019t say he is very fraternal.\u00a0</p><p>Traditionalism is absolutely none of Tony\u2019s traits, and I don\u2019t think, I have to explain that. He invented a lot of new things, he changed the course of his whole industrie and he didn\u2019t care about traditions at all. Like christmas for example. I mean, did you saw a christmasy Tony in Iron Man 3? Like, the whole movie sets around christmas and I always forget this, because there are no signs. Tony is a very modern person, I\u2019m sure about that.\u00a0</p><p>Leadership quality. Well, no. I mean, he is good at co-leading, I have to give him that, at least with the avengers. But Tony himself said, that Steve is the boss and it was always Steve who lead the avengers. Because Tonys decisions are too irrational to actually lead things.

You weren\u2019t together but sometimes you both acted like you were? It was a sort of unspoken thing and you guess that the reason that neither of you questioned it or said anything is because, well the both of you didn\u2019t want things to go bad between each other. You were good friends, throughout all the bad stuff that had happened to you both, you were always there for each other. You loved Barry and Barry loved you.

Coming to a stop, Barry gives you a nod and you both start to talk to everyone back at S.T.A.R Labs through the comms, waiting for the signal.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOkay you guys, we\u2019re here, you got our location?\u201d Barry asks through his comms, awaiting a response from Cisco or even Caitlin, as you did too. You were excited to try the tachyon device out, it\u2019s supposed to be like this supercharge battery that well, charges the speed force in us.</p><p>Back at S.T.A.R Labs, Cisco asks us, \u201cYou good?

His hands come up to cup your face, fingers lightly brushing your cheeks before he places a gentle kiss to your lips. Pulling away, he nods, gives you a reassuring smile and places the device on his chest, you mimic his actions, jumping a bit at the sudden reaction you feel your body have to it, you feel kind of jittery and well, nervous. You lick your lips and ball up your fists before squeezing your eyes shut as you mentally prepare for the outcome of this.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhoo! Yeah!\u201d Barry exhales, feeling the device work.</p><p>You have the same reaction; it really does feel like your speed force cells are being supercharged. \u201cWoah, I feel that!\u201d You exhale.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat is the tachyon device, powering up the speed force in your cells like a quick charge battery.\u201d Caitlin says, sounding very chipper.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow do you guys feel?\u201d She asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, weird, but in a good way.\u201d You answer, feeling a rush of energy.</p><p>\u201cDifferent, really different.\u201d Barry says with a sweet smile plastered on his face. His excitement was quite evident.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how long it takes for you to get back here, on my count\u2026\u201d Cisco says. That was the signal, well kind of, it was a count-down but same thing. You and Barry, got into position, waiting for that go.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou ready Flash?\u201d You smirk at the handsome speedster next to you.</p><p>\u201c\u20263..2\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as you are Swift.\u201d He grins, shooting you a rather flirty smirk.</p><p>\u201c..1..Go!\u201d Cisco says as starts watching the timer on the clock, waiting for Barry and you to return to the S.T.A.R Labs.</p><p>Barry and you run, much much faster than before.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDang, this thing has them crusin\u2019\u2026\u201d Cisco says, honestly impressed by you guys speed.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow fast do they normally go?\u201d Iris asks, interested about this whole situation and kind of worried about you and Barry.</p><p>\u201cNot this fast.\u201d Caitlin says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, are their vitals okay?\u201d Cisco asks as his eyes widen at how fast the two of you are running around, the city.</p><p>Looking at the screen, Caitlin is relieved and kind of impressed, \u201cYeah, they\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cCool, it\u2019s like having a pit stop attached to your chest.\u201d Iris says impressed.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I can go faster!\u201d You say as you ran throughout the city.</p><p>\u201cYeah, guys, me too!\u201d Barry says.</p><p>A grin appears on Cisco\u2019s face as he simply says, \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Smiling to yourself you ran, faster that you\u2019ve ever ran before. Hell, probably faster than Barry has too, but you sort of ran so fast that you managed to travel to another Earth. You didn\u2019t know that at first, but you found out eventually.</p><p><br/></p><p>How did you find that out, well eventually from the guy dressed in a red and blue suit who you saved from a falling building indirectly told you so? After speaking to him for a few minutes you knew for a fact that he wasn\u2019t a meta from Central City.</p><p>You had spotted him the moment you came to a stop, scanning the area you, ran up the building, catching him swiftly, like your name sake and ran towards a field, although you didn\u2019t mean too.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on fire!\u201d the guy exclaims, through his mask as he tried to put the fire out.</p><p>\u201cYeah uh\u2026 sorry about that it happens sometimes, with the fiction of running at\u2026\u201d You say but the actions of the guy makes you stop for a moment, you look at him, his suit, head to toe and wonder, who is he and where did he get it, but he has something else to say, something extremely weird but not unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like her.\u201d He says, taking a step back and removing his mask. You examined his face, but sadness clouded his features. He looked at you, but you had your mask on, your identity was still hidden, and it seemed to disappoint him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t need you to save me.\u201d He grimaced.</p><p>You were taken aback by that statement, confused. \u201cUh, yeah you did, you were falling out of a building, if I hadn\u2019t saved you would be splat.\u201d You say, crossing your arms.</p><p><br/></p><p>He shakes his head before putting his mask back on, \u201cI-uh have to get back to the city.\u201d He says, turning around and starts swinging in the air. Shooting webs out of his wrists, he moved like a spider. Like the symbol what was on his suit, it made sense.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2026that\u2019s a new one.\u201d You gape to yourself before you speed towards him. Stopping him at his tracks.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d You ask the guy; you were so sure that this Central City maybe he was from Keystone? Maybe this was Keystone?</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI-uh\u2026I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d He says, puffing his chest out a bit, sounding a bit awkward.</p><p><br/></p><p>\n\ntags - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSHRHLan5qR13csDWWNA0NQ\" target=\"_blank\">@xbabykookiix</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOpx2-TeUg7NS5UyVKX3sOg\" target=\"_blank\">@opportunitythemarsrover</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\" target=\"_blank\">@kewl-r</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myMfiFhOI9m3VZ3_x7VPlyg\" target=\"_blank\">@crystallinestorms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxGFvgPkB9COIZiUWcx9wTg\" target=\"_blank\">@seppys-return-to-madness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mysGhZ6aEYr6aZ6eValSUOA\" target=\"_blank\">@mixed-fandoms-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml3xHyjnjL2G7XNCPMzxzrg\" target=\"_blank\">@sunrisespidey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jjhUSEjAE34RgHiiTj0dw\" target=\"_blank\">@upsidedownparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWiuaNmZ_gvkS_Fehlkkteg\" target=\"_blank\">@vintagebeauty1496</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgJhwm1N8BcbixN_utZP-Vw\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a>@spideylovin</a>\u200b <a>@thatonekid520</a>\u200b <a>@oyasumayday</a>\u200b <a>@exo-talented-kings</a>\u200b <a>@bandsruinedmylife</a>\u200b @anterricchaos <a>@frustrated-ferret</a>\u200b <a>@the-story-of-the-tucks</a>\u200b <a>@marvelbisexualbean</a>\u200b @nicoleaustin619 <a>@bellaforever365</a>\u200b <a>@ximaginx</a>\u200b <a>@trashinaglass</a>\u200b <a>@hillsnholland</a>\u200b <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1LCDoB3Cx5dIAEwK1HO3Kg\" target=\"_blank\">@thescarletspeedsterbha</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEECr5hTjNL6PF-lYIV53sA\" target=\"_blank\">@onceuponateenpanwolfian</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mha4i3OjIkHQuWassQEsoeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@immagiftedturtle</a> @weirdperson04<br/></p>",

It was a sort of unspoken thing and you guess that the reason that neither of you questioned it or said anything is because, well the both of you didn\u2019t want things to go bad between each other. You were good friends, throughout all the bad stuff that had happened to you both, you were always there for each other. You loved Barry and Barry loved you. When the particle accelerator exploded, Barry and you had gotten your powers, the exact same powers. You were visiting him at his lab at CCPD when it had happened, woke up a few months later and your lives were forever changed. With the good, came the bad, arguments and disagreements with Barry were more often and it wasn\u2019t something either of you liked. But you both worked on it, communicating better, and things have been going well. It has been 3 years and your friendship were still strong, but now it was also a partnership, The Flash and Swift.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBarry, Y/N, I need you both to take these with you, run somewhere and wait for our signal.\u201d Cisco says as we enter the cortex, handing us the tachyon devices.</p><p>Taking the identical devices from Cisco, Barry and you speed change into your suits and sped away, meeting at the Keystone City boarder. Coming to a stop, Barry gives you a nod and you both start to talk to everyone back at S.T.A.R Labs through the comms, waiting for the signal.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay you guys, we\u2019re here, you got our location?\u201d Barry asks through his comms, awaiting a response from Cisco or even Caitlin, as you did too. You were excited to try the tachyon device out, it\u2019s supposed to be like this supercharge battery that well, charges the speed force in us.</p><p>Back at S.T.A.R Labs, Cisco asks us, \u201cYou good? You guys don\u2019t need to like stretch or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo no no we\u2019re good, Cisco.\u201d You answer, chuckling at your friend.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this tachyon enhancer out for a test drive.\u201d Cisco says trying to sound cool, Caitlin and Iris standing closely behind him, not wanting to miss anything.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You say as you turn to face Barry. His hands come up to cup your face, fingers lightly brushing your cheeks before he places a gentle kiss to your lips. Pulling away, he nods, gives you a reassuring smile and places the device on his chest, you mimic his actions, jumping a bit at the sudden reaction you feel your body have to it, you feel kind of jittery and well, nervous. You lick your lips and ball up your fists before squeezing your eyes shut as you mentally prepare for the outcome of this.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhoo! Yeah!\u201d Barry exhales, feeling the device work.</p><p>You have the same reaction; it really does feel like your speed force cells are being supercharged. \u201cWoah, I feel that!\u201d You exhale.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat is the tachyon device, powering up the speed force in your cells like a quick charge battery.\u201d Caitlin says, sounding very chipper.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow do you guys feel?\u201d She asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, weird, but in a good way.\u201d You answer, feeling a rush of energy.</p><p>\u201cDifferent, really different.\u201d Barry says with a sweet smile plastered on his face. His excitement was quite evident.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how long it takes for you to get back here, on my count\u2026\u201d Cisco says. That was the signal, well kind of, it was a count-down but same thing. You and Barry, got into position, waiting for that go.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou ready Flash?\u201d You smirk at the handsome speedster next to you.</p><p>\u201c\u20263..2\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as you are Swift.\u201d He grins, shooting you a rather flirty smirk.</p><p>\u201c..1..Go!\u201d Cisco says as starts watching the timer on the clock, waiting for Barry and you to return to the S.T.A.R Labs.</p><p>Barry and you run, much much faster than before.<br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDang, this thing has them crusin\u2019\u2026\u201d Cisco says, honestly impressed by you guys speed.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow fast do they normally go?\u201d Iris asks, interested about this whole situation and kind of worried about you and Barry.</p><p>\u201cNot this fast.\u201d Caitlin says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cNot even close, are their vitals okay?\u201d Cisco asks as his eyes widen at how fast the two of you are running around, the city.</p><p>Looking at the screen, Caitlin is relieved and kind of impressed, \u201cYeah, they\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCool, it\u2019s like having a pit stop attached to your chest.\u201d Iris says impressed.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I can go faster!\u201d You say as you ran throughout the city.</p><p>\u201cYeah, guys, me too!\u201d Barry says.</p><p>A grin appears on Cisco\u2019s face as he simply says, \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Smiling to yourself you ran, faster that you\u2019ve ever ran before. Hell, probably faster than Barry has too, but you sort of ran so fast that you managed to travel to another Earth. You didn\u2019t know that at first, but you found out eventually.</p><p><br></p><p>How did you find that out, well eventually from the guy dressed in a red and blue suit who you saved from a falling building indirectly told you so? After speaking to him for a few minutes you knew for a fact that he wasn\u2019t a meta from Central City.</p><p>You had spotted him the moment you came to a stop, scanning the area you, ran up the building, catching him swiftly, like your name sake and ran towards a field, although you didn\u2019t mean too.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on fire!\u201d the guy exclaims, through his mask as he tried to put the fire out.</p><p>\u201cYeah uh\u2026 sorry about that it happens sometimes, with the fiction of running at\u2026\u201d You say but the actions of the guy makes you stop for a moment, you look at him, his suit, head to toe and wonder, who is he and where did he get it, but he has something else to say, something extremely weird but not unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like her.\u201d He says, taking a step back and removing his mask. You examined his face, but sadness clouded his features. He looked at you, but you had your mask on, your identity was still hidden, and it seemed to disappoint him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t need you to save me.\u201d He grimaced.</p><p>You were taken aback by that statement, confused. \u201cUh, yeah you did, you were falling out of a building, if I hadn\u2019t saved you would be splat.\u201d You say, crossing your arms.</p><p><br></p><p>He shakes his head before putting his mask back on, \u201cI-uh have to get back to the city.\u201d He says, turning around and starts swinging in the air. Shooting webs out of his wrists, he moved like a spider. Like the symbol what was on his suit, it made sense.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2026that\u2019s a new one.\u201d You gape to yourself before you speed towards him.

Hell, probably faster than Barry has too, but you sort of ran so fast that you managed to travel to another Earth. You didn&rsquo;t know that at first, but you found out eventually.</p><p><br /></p><p>How did you find that out, well eventually from the guy dressed in a red and blue suit who you saved from a falling building indirectly told you so? After speaking to him for a few minutes you knew for a fact that he wasn&rsquo;t a meta from Central City.</p><p>You had spotted him the moment you came to a stop, scanning the area you, ran up the building, catching him swiftly, like your name sake and ran towards a field, although you didn&rsquo;t mean too.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on fire!&rdquo; the guy exclaims, through his mask as he tried to put the fire out.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah uh&hellip; sorry about that it happens sometimes, with the fiction of running at&hellip;&rdquo; You say but the actions of the guy makes you stop for a moment, you look at him, his suit, head to toe and wonder, who is he and where did he get it, but he has something else to say, something extremely weird but not unbelievable.</p><p>&ldquo;You sound like her.&rdquo; He says, taking a step back and removing his mask. You examined his face, but sadness clouded his features. He looked at you, but you had your mask on, your identity was still hidden, and it seemed to disappoint him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;By the way, I didn&rsquo;t need you to save me.&rdquo; He grimaced.</p><p>You were taken aback by that statement, confused. &ldquo;Uh, yeah you did, you were falling out of a building, if I hadn&rsquo;t saved you would be splat.&rdquo; You say, crossing your arms.</p><p><br /></p><p>He shakes his head before putting his mask back on, &ldquo;I-uh have to get back to the city.&rdquo; He says, turning around and starts swinging in the air. Shooting webs out of his wrists, he moved like a spider. Like the symbol what was on his suit, it made sense.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What the hell&hellip;that&rsquo;s a new one.&rdquo; You gape to yourself before you speed towards him. Stopping him at his tracks.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo; You ask the guy; you were so sure that this Central City maybe he was from Keystone? Maybe this was Keystone?</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I-uh&hellip;I&rsquo;m Spider-Man.&rdquo; He says, puffing his chest out a bit, sounding a bit awkward.</p><p><br /></p><p>\n\ntags - <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSHRHLan5qR13csDWWNA0NQ\" target=\"_blank\">@xbabykookiix</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOpx2-TeUg7NS5UyVKX3sOg\" target=\"_blank\">@opportunitythemarsrover</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1MfzScq_8L0AhximwRM8wg\" target=\"_blank\">@kewl-r</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myMfiFhOI9m3VZ3_x7VPlyg\" target=\"_blank\">@crystallinestorms</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxGFvgPkB9COIZiUWcx9wTg\" target=\"_blank\">@seppys-return-to-madness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mysGhZ6aEYr6aZ6eValSUOA\" target=\"_blank\">@mixed-fandoms-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml3xHyjnjL2G7XNCPMzxzrg\" target=\"_blank\">@sunrisespidey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9jjhUSEjAE34RgHiiTj0dw\" target=\"_blank\">@upsidedownparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWiuaNmZ_gvkS_Fehlkkteg\" target=\"_blank\">@vintagebeauty1496</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgJhwm1N8BcbixN_utZP-Vw\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a>@spideylovin</a>&#8203; <a>@thatonekid520</a>&#8203; <a>@oyasumayday</a>&#8203; <a>@exo-talented-kings</a>&#8203; <a>@bandsruinedmylife</a>&#8203; @anterricchaos <a>@frustrated-ferret</a>&#8203; <a>@the-story-of-the-tucks</a>&#8203; <a>@marvelbisexualbean</a>&#8203; @nicoleaustin619 <a>@bellaforever365</a>&#8203; <a>@ximaginx</a>&#8203; <a>@trashinaglass</a>&#8203; <a>@hillsnholland</a>&#8203; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1LCDoB3Cx5dIAEwK1HO3Kg\" target=\"_blank\">@thescarletspeedsterbha</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEECr5hTjNL6PF-lYIV53sA\" target=\"_blank\">@onceuponateenpanwolfian</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mha4i3OjIkHQuWassQEsoeQ\" target=\"_blank\">@immagiftedturtle</a> @weirdperson04<br /></p>",
