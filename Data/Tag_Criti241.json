        "answer": "<p><a href=\"http://kanafinwhy.tumblr.com/post/179591797002/platonic-touch\"><b><i>[20 - Carrying while half asleep]</i></b></a><br/></p><hr><p>Despite the heavy\nclouds and pelting rain, Caleb knew \u2013 as he usually did \u2013 exactly\nwhat time it was; it had just gone two hours past midnight.</p><p>He also knew \u2013\nmore or less, by the map that the coachman had had before \u2013 roughly\nwhere they were on the road to the nearest town. Unfortunately, with\nthese combined facts, he also knew they had about as much hope of\nreaching there before morning came as he had of making a campfire to\nwarm their hands, which were starting to go numb with cold as the icy\nwind blew unremittingly against their soaked clothes and hair. \n</p><p>Not that he hadn\u2019t\ntried; he had held a little flame in his hands for Nott to warm her\nhands by not long ago, but his attempt to light a bundle of soaked\nsticks by the side of the road had failed, as he had expected. Now,\nthey had both fallen silent, plodding forward hand in hand in the\nrain-lashed dark that was only broken by the sight of Caleb\u2019s\ndancing lights. Nott, beside him, had taken to watching the lights\nbobbing along before them and on both sides as though mesmerised. Her\nbreath and his clouded in the cold night air, mingling with the little\nhalos of brightness where the rain bounced off the arcane lights. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>She was staring with\na rather glazed expression, her ears drooping in the way that Caleb\nknew by now meant she had gone beyond a bad mood to sheer exhaustion.\nEven Frumpkin had, of his own accord, ceased padding along beside him\nand jumped up to wrap around Caleb\u2019s shoulders like a very heavy,\nvery wet scarf. Actually, Caleb couldn\u2019t blame him for that.</p><p>It was fair enough\ntoo, he thought, that the coachman had thrown them out when it became\napparent that they were not, in fact, a mother and her young child,\nbut instead\u2026 well, who they really were. And if their appearance\nalone hadn\u2019t been enough, there was also the fact that they hadn\u2019t\nhad enough to pay the public coach fare to the next town. And the\nfact that Nott had been caught with her hand in one of the other\npassengers\u2019 pockets. That probably hadn\u2019t helped. \n</p><p>They had had to flee\ntown in even more of a hurry than usual, and their disguises had been\ncorrespondingly rudimentary. Still, either way it was the same,\nbecause the driver had stopped the whole coach to throw them off at\nthe side of the road, then promptly whipped the horses back into\nmotion and vanished off into the rain. And now they were faced with\nthe prospect of walking for the several hours that it would surely\ntake to get there. They had next to money, and barely a spell or two\nleft between them, until they slept. So, walking in the rain it would\nhave to be. Caleb blinked as thunder rumbled overhead, and sneezed;\nhe seemed to be catching a cold. Not that he couldn\u2019t tolerate it,\nand of course he had no right to complain, but it was\u2026inconvenient.\nHe blinked sodden hair from his eyes, miserably. \n</p><p>Beside him, Nott\nsneezed too. Frumpkin yowled dejectedly.</p><p>At the sound, Nott\nlooked up, her eyes barely focused, blinking up at him. She sagged\nagainst him, tugging on his hand for a moment, until she seemed to\nforce herself upright with willpower. Caleb sighed. \u201cNott, do you\nwant me to carry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry\nabout me!\u201d chirped Nott, blinking a few more times. She stifled a\nyawn, pulled down her mask and wiped her nose on her sleeve, then\ntook out her flask, making a face when she remembered it was empty.\n\u201cI\u2019m just fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are falling\nasleep on your feet, Nott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot\u2026really\u2026\nbesides, <i>you\u2019re</i> the one who needs sleep, Caleb.\u201d She\nlooked rather downtrodden, which was not hard with her bedraggled\nappearance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I blew our cover back there. That was my\nfault.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cNo, those\ndisguises were not my best anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh, Caleb, they\nwere lovely. You did the best you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ja</i>, well.\nThey did not work.\u201d He frowned, grasping Nott\u2019s hand to keep her\nfrom slipping into a pool of muddy water that had gathered in one of\nthe wheel ruts on the road. \u201cAnd it will be\u2026a while before we are\nin the next place. I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, clearly\ndejected but trying to stay positive. \u201cWhat\u2019s it called again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town?\u201d\nCaleb thought back to the map he had seen briefly. \u201cAh\u2026\nTrostenwald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you know\nanything about it?\u201d</p><p>Caleb smiled, wryly.\n\u201cNo. But we are not wanted for anything there yet, and that is good\nenough for me.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his\nhand. \u201cI hope they have a book shop there. For you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are\u2026 very\nbroke right now, Nott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some\nmoney, then.\u201d She looked up dreamily, at the bobbing light directly\nin front of her. \u201cI hope there\u2019s a tavern full of fancy people\nfrom out of town, who aren\u2019t paying attention. With big pockets\u2026\non the <i>outside</i> of their coats. Also, booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a lot of\nwishes. I just hope there is somewhere we can sleep that is out of\nthe rain. Frumpkin does not like having wet fur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. How long\nwill <i>you</i> sleep for?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\nMaybe an entire day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I can sleep\nfor longer.\u201d Nott giggled. \u201cBet you all the money we don\u2019t\nhave.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Nein</i>. <i>I</i>\nbet <i>you</i> all the money we do not have that <i>I</i> can sleep\nfor longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d She gave\na pained grin, flicking her ears a little to shake the water off.\nCaleb sneezed again, in the silence. \u201cWe\u2019d better hurry there,\nbefore you catch a cold.\u201d \n</p><p>They walked quietly\nfor a little while longer, a companionable sort of silence, quickly\nbecoming a silence born of simple exhaustion. Caleb\u2019s fingers and\nfeet were almost completely numb now, his whole body soaked as though\nhe had fallen into a freezing pond.</p><p>After a while,\nthough, he felt Nott\u2019s fingers loosen in his, and he only had a\nmoment to react as she slipped to the ground, making a high\nwhimpering sound as she fell in the mud. Immediately, Frumpkin jumped\ndown from shoulder, standing delicately on the grass bank beside the\nroad and beginning to lick Nott\u2019s cheek as she leaned down,\nclutching her ankle with gritted teeth. \n</p><p>Caleb knelt down in\nthe mud beside her, his own exhaustion momentarily driven away by the\ngrimace of pain on her face as she clutched at her ankle, which must\nsurely be twisted or worse. He winced; Nott had convinced him to take\ntheir last healing potion himself two towns ago, when he had clumsily\nsliced his palms open climbing over that spiked metal fence. He\nshould have saved it; <i>stupid</i>, he thought, reflexively. \n</p><p>\u201cAh\u2026it\u2019s fine,\nCaleb, I can walk!\u201d protested Nott, trying to use a reluctant\nFrumpkin to lean against and lever herself up before collapsing back\nin the mud with a quiet shriek as her ankle gave out under her. \n</p><p>\u201cNo you cannot\u201d\nhe said firmly. He took her hands in his and trying to calm her as\nbest he could. Caleb knew he himself had a higher tolerance for pain\nthan most, but seeing her hurting was always than any injury he might\nsuffer. She didn\u2019t deserve it, after all. \n</p><p>He frowned, making a\ndecision, slipping his hand into his component pouch. Summoning all\nthe strength that was left to him, he scooped Nott up into his arms,\nswaying a little and nearly falling himself before catching his\nbalance. She was not heavy, but she was soaked with water and\nsquirming in protest immediately, which made things significantly\nmore difficult.</p><p>\u201cCaleb! Put me\ndown. I\u2019m \u2013 <i>ow!</i> - I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Nein</i>. You\ncannot walk like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nexhausted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are hurt.\nPlease Nott. Trust me.\u201d \n</p><p>That was it. She was\nalways so inexplicably trusting. She looked at him for just a moment,\nand he took the chance of her momentary hesitation. He pulled back\nher hood a little, and summoning all of what little magical strength\nhe had left \u2013 hopefully enough for the one spell \u2013 he sprinkled a\nlittle sand onto her forehead and muttered a few words under his\nbreath. \n</p><p>Given how exhausted\nNott was already, the sleep spell worked easily. Suddenly, she\nstopped struggling, curling up in the cradle of his arms. Getting his\nbalance, Caleb maneuvered his arms a little so that her weight was\nbetter balanced in his arms, her relative warmth pressed against his\nchest as her even sleep breaths gusted out in frigid clouds.</p><p>Caleb\nlet out his own breath, in a\nsoft, whistling sigh. <i>Keep\non moving forward. No time to waste</i>. Turning his face into the\ncold and the lashing rain, he pressed on into the night, with\nFrumpkin following along at his heels.</p><p>By the time he\nreached the town, the rain had slowed, and the cold light before dawn\nwas beginning to reflect off the slate-grey waters of a long lake. A\ndamp wooden sign with flaking paint proclaimed that the town that\nclung to the curve of its bank was Trostenwald. Caleb\u2019s eyes barely\nskimmed over the letters though, his gaze slipping too over the face\nof the weary night guard as he told one of his more routine lies; he\nbarely even recalled what he said, as he was holding Nott cradled to\nhis chest, his damp scarf wrapped around her like an extra shawl.</p><p>The guard waved them\nthrough and he had just enough consciousness left to wander to the\nnearest inn, spend his very last few coins on a room. The climb up\nthe stairs felt like a lifetime\u2019s journey, before he entered the\nroom and kicked off his wet boots. \n</p><p>He paused, then,\nlaying Nott carefully down on the bed. Her ears twitched a little in\nher sleep, curling closer to Frumpkin as the cat jumped up onto the\nbed beside her, leaving wet, muddy paw prints on the sheets. Nott\u2019s\nsleeping fingers found their way into damp ginger fur, and\nimmediately Frumpkin began to purr. \n</p><p>His family, Caleb\nthought as he watched this, head spinning with sleep already. Not\nthat he deserved to have a family ever again. But after all, he\nthought, he was a selfish man, and so he would take what he could\nget. \n</p><p>And that was the\nlast thing that he thought before lying down on the bed beside Nott\nand Frumpkin, too tired to even take off his wet coat. \n</p><p>A mere moment later,\nhe had fallen into a deep, deep and dreamless sleep.</p>",

Actually, Caleb couldn\u2019t blame him for that.</p><p>It was fair enough\ntoo, he thought, that the coachman had thrown them out when it became\napparent that they were not, in fact, a mother and her young child,\nbut instead\u2026 well, who they really were. And if their appearance\nalone hadn\u2019t been enough, there was also the fact that they hadn\u2019t\nhad enough to pay the public coach fare to the next town. And the\nfact that Nott had been caught with her hand in one of the other\npassengers\u2019 pockets. That probably hadn\u2019t helped. \n</p><p>They had had to flee\ntown in even more of a hurry than usual, and their disguises had been\ncorrespondingly rudimentary. Still, either way it was the same,\nbecause the driver had stopped the whole coach to throw them off at\nthe side of the road, then promptly whipped the horses back into\nmotion and vanished off into the rain. And now they were faced with\nthe prospect of walking for the several hours that it would surely\ntake to get there. They had next to money, and barely a spell or two\nleft between them, until they slept. So, walking in the rain it would\nhave to be. Caleb blinked as thunder rumbled overhead, and sneezed;\nhe seemed to be catching a cold. Not that he couldn\u2019t tolerate it,\nand of course he had no right to complain, but it was\u2026inconvenient.\nHe blinked sodden hair from his eyes, miserably. \n</p><p>Beside him, Nott\nsneezed too. Frumpkin yowled dejectedly.</p><p>At the sound, Nott\nlooked up, her eyes barely focused, blinking up at him. She sagged\nagainst him, tugging on his hand for a moment, until she seemed to\nforce herself upright with willpower. Caleb sighed. \u201cNott, do you\nwant me to carry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry\nabout me!\u201d chirped Nott, blinking a few more times. She stifled a\nyawn, pulled down her mask and wiped her nose on her sleeve, then\ntook out her flask, making a face when she remembered it was empty.\n\u201cI\u2019m just fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are falling\nasleep on your feet, Nott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot\u2026really\u2026\nbesides, <i>you\u2019re</i> the one who needs sleep, Caleb.\u201d She\nlooked rather downtrodden, which was not hard with her bedraggled\nappearance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I blew our cover back there. That was my\nfault.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cNo, those\ndisguises were not my best anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh, Caleb, they\nwere lovely. You did the best you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ja</i>, well.\nThey did not work.\u201d He frowned, grasping Nott\u2019s hand to keep her\nfrom slipping into a pool of muddy water that had gathered in one of\nthe wheel ruts on the road. \u201cAnd it will be\u2026a while before we are\nin the next place. I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, clearly\ndejected but trying to stay positive. \u201cWhat\u2019s it called again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town?\u201d\nCaleb thought back to the map he had seen briefly. \u201cAh\u2026\nTrostenwald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you know\nanything about it?\u201d</p><p>Caleb smiled, wryly.\n\u201cNo. But we are not wanted for anything there yet, and that is good\nenough for me.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his\nhand. \u201cI hope they have a book shop there. For you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are\u2026 very\nbroke right now, Nott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some\nmoney, then.\u201d She looked up dreamily, at the bobbing light directly\nin front of her. \u201cI hope there\u2019s a tavern full of fancy people\nfrom out of town, who aren\u2019t paying attention. With big pockets\u2026\non the <i>outside</i> of their coats. Also, booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a lot of\nwishes. I just hope there is somewhere we can sleep that is out of\nthe rain.

That was my\nfault.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cNo, those\ndisguises were not my best anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh, Caleb, they\nwere lovely. You did the best you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ja</i>, well.\nThey did not work.\u201d He frowned, grasping Nott\u2019s hand to keep her\nfrom slipping into a pool of muddy water that had gathered in one of\nthe wheel ruts on the road. \u201cAnd it will be\u2026a while before we are\nin the next place. I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, clearly\ndejected but trying to stay positive. \u201cWhat\u2019s it called again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town?\u201d\nCaleb thought back to the map he had seen briefly. \u201cAh\u2026\nTrostenwald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you know\nanything about it?\u201d</p><p>Caleb smiled, wryly.\n\u201cNo. But we are not wanted for anything there yet, and that is good\nenough for me.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his\nhand. \u201cI hope they have a book shop there. For you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are\u2026 very\nbroke right now, Nott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some\nmoney, then.\u201d She looked up dreamily, at the bobbing light directly\nin front of her. \u201cI hope there\u2019s a tavern full of fancy people\nfrom out of town, who aren\u2019t paying attention. With big pockets\u2026\non the <i>outside</i> of their coats. Also, booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a lot of\nwishes. I just hope there is somewhere we can sleep that is out of\nthe rain. Frumpkin does not like having wet fur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. How long\nwill <i>you</i> sleep for?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\nMaybe an entire day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I can sleep\nfor longer.\u201d Nott giggled. \u201cBet you all the money we don\u2019t\nhave.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Nein</i>. <i>I</i>\nbet <i>you</i> all the money we do not have that <i>I</i> can sleep\nfor longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d She gave\na pained grin, flicking her ears a little to shake the water off.\nCaleb sneezed again, in the silence. \u201cWe\u2019d better hurry there,\nbefore you catch a cold.\u201d \n</p><p>They walked quietly\nfor a little while longer, a companionable sort of silence, quickly\nbecoming a silence born of simple exhaustion. Caleb\u2019s fingers and\nfeet were almost completely numb now, his whole body soaked as though\nhe had fallen into a freezing pond.</p><p>After a while,\nthough, he felt Nott\u2019s fingers loosen in his, and he only had a\nmoment to react as she slipped to the ground, making a high\nwhimpering sound as she fell in the mud. Immediately, Frumpkin jumped\ndown from shoulder, standing delicately on the grass bank beside the\nroad and beginning to lick Nott\u2019s cheek as she leaned down,\nclutching her ankle with gritted teeth. \n</p><p>Caleb knelt down in\nthe mud beside her, his own exhaustion momentarily driven away by the\ngrimace of pain on her face as she clutched at her ankle, which must\nsurely be twisted or worse. He winced; Nott had convinced him to take\ntheir last healing potion himself two towns ago, when he had clumsily\nsliced his palms open climbing over that spiked metal fence. He\nshould have saved it; <i>stupid</i>, he thought, reflexively. \n</p><p>\u201cAh\u2026it\u2019s fine,\nCaleb, I can walk!\u201d protested Nott, trying to use a reluctant\nFrumpkin to lean against and lever herself up before collapsing back\nin the mud with a quiet shriek as her ankle gave out under her. \n</p><p>\u201cNo you cannot\u201d\nhe said firmly. He took her hands in his and trying to calm her as\nbest he could. Caleb knew he himself had a higher tolerance for pain\nthan most, but seeing her hurting was always than any injury he might\nsuffer. She didn\u2019t deserve it, after all. \n</p><p>He frowned, making a\ndecision, slipping his hand into his component pouch. Summoning all\nthe strength that was left to him, he scooped Nott up into his arms,\nswaying a little and nearly falling himself before catching his\nbalance. She was not heavy, but she was soaked with water and\nsquirming in protest immediately, which made things significantly\nmore difficult.</p><p>\u201cCaleb! Put me\ndown. I\u2019m \u2013 <i>ow!</i> - I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Nein</i>. You\ncannot walk like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\nexhausted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are hurt.\nPlease Nott. Trust me.\u201d \n</p><p>That was it. She was\nalways so inexplicably trusting. She looked at him for just a moment,\nand he took the chance of her momentary hesitation. He pulled back\nher hood a little, and summoning all of what little magical strength\nhe had left \u2013 hopefully enough for the one spell \u2013 he sprinkled a\nlittle sand onto her forehead and muttered a few words under his\nbreath. \n</p><p>Given how exhausted\nNott was already, the sleep spell worked easily. Suddenly, she\nstopped struggling, curling up in the cradle of his arms. Getting his\nbalance, Caleb maneuvered his arms a little so that her weight was\nbetter balanced in his arms, her relative warmth pressed against his\nchest as her even sleep breaths gusted out in frigid clouds.</p><p>Caleb\nlet out his own breath, in a\nsoft, whistling sigh. <i>Keep\non moving forward. No time to waste</i>. Turning his face into the\ncold and the lashing rain, he pressed on into the night, with\nFrumpkin following along at his heels.</p><p>By the time he\nreached the town, the rain had slowed, and the cold light before dawn\nwas beginning to reflect off the slate-grey waters of a long lake. A\ndamp wooden sign with flaking paint proclaimed that the town that\nclung to the curve of its bank was Trostenwald. Caleb\u2019s eyes barely\nskimmed over the letters though, his gaze slipping too over the face\nof the weary night guard as he told one of his more routine lies; he\nbarely even recalled what he said, as he was holding Nott cradled to\nhis chest, his damp scarf wrapped around her like an extra shawl.</p><p>The guard waved them\nthrough and he had just enough consciousness left to wander to the\nnearest inn, spend his very last few coins on a room. The climb up\nthe stairs felt like a lifetime\u2019s journey, before he entered the\nroom and kicked off his wet boots. \n</p><p>He paused, then,\nlaying Nott carefully down on the bed. Her ears twitched a little in\nher sleep, curling closer to Frumpkin as the cat jumped up onto the\nbed beside her, leaving wet, muddy paw prints on the sheets. Nott\u2019s\nsleeping fingers found their way into damp ginger fur, and\nimmediately Frumpkin began to purr. \n</p><p>His family, Caleb\nthought as he watched this, head spinning with sleep already. Not\nthat he deserved to have a family ever again. But after all, he\nthought, he was a selfish man, and so he would take what he could\nget. \n</p><p>And that was the\nlast thing that he thought before lying down on the bed beside Nott\nand Frumpkin, too tired to even take off his wet coat. \n</p><p>A mere moment later,\nhe had fallen into a deep, deep and dreamless sleep.</p>",
                "content": "<p><a href=\"http://kanafinwhy.tumblr.com/post/179591797002/platonic-touch\"><b><i>[20 - Carrying while half asleep]</i></b></a><br /></p><hr /><p>Despite the heavy\nclouds and pelting rain, Caleb knew &ndash; as he usually did &ndash; exactly\nwhat time it was; it had just gone two hours past midnight.</p><p>He also knew &ndash;\nmore or less, by the map that the coachman had had before &ndash; roughly\nwhere they were on the road to the nearest town. Unfortunately, with\nthese combined facts, he also knew they had about as much hope of\nreaching there before morning came as he had of making a campfire to\nwarm their hands, which were starting to go numb with cold as the icy\nwind blew unremittingly against their soaked clothes and hair. \n</p><p>Not that he hadn&rsquo;t\ntried; he had held a little flame in his hands for Nott to warm her\nhands by not long ago, but his attempt to light a bundle of soaked\nsticks by the side of the road had failed, as he had expected. Now,\nthey had both fallen silent, plodding forward hand in hand in the\nrain-lashed dark that was only broken by the sight of Caleb&rsquo;s\ndancing lights. Nott, beside him, had taken to watching the lights\nbobbing along before them and on both sides as though mesmerised. Her\nbreath and his clouded in the cold night air, mingling with the little\nhalos of brightness where the rain bounced off the arcane lights. <br /></p><p>She was staring with\na rather glazed expression, her ears drooping in the way that Caleb\nknew by now meant she had gone beyond a bad mood to sheer exhaustion.\nEven Frumpkin had, of his own accord, ceased padding along beside him\nand jumped up to wrap around Caleb&rsquo;s shoulders like a very heavy,\nvery wet scarf. Actually, Caleb couldn&rsquo;t blame him for that.</p><p>It was fair enough\ntoo, he thought, that the coachman had thrown them out when it became\napparent that they were not, in fact, a mother and her young child,\nbut instead&hellip; well, who they really were. And if their appearance\nalone hadn&rsquo;t been enough, there was also the fact that they hadn&rsquo;t\nhad enough to pay the public coach fare to the next town. And the\nfact that Nott had been caught with her hand in one of the other\npassengers&rsquo; pockets. That probably hadn&rsquo;t helped. \n</p><p>They had had to flee\ntown in even more of a hurry than usual, and their disguises had been\ncorrespondingly rudimentary. Still, either way it was the same,\nbecause the driver had stopped the whole coach to throw them off at\nthe side of the road, then promptly whipped the horses back into\nmotion and vanished off into the rain. And now they were faced with\nthe prospect of walking for the several hours that it would surely\ntake to get there. They had next to money, and barely a spell or two\nleft between them, until they slept. So, walking in the rain it would\nhave to be. Caleb blinked as thunder rumbled overhead, and sneezed;\nhe seemed to be catching a cold. Not that he couldn&rsquo;t tolerate it,\nand of course he had no right to complain, but it was&hellip;inconvenient.\nHe blinked sodden hair from his eyes, miserably. \n</p><p>Beside him, Nott\nsneezed too. Frumpkin yowled dejectedly.</p><p>At the sound, Nott\nlooked up, her eyes barely focused, blinking up at him. She sagged\nagainst him, tugging on his hand for a moment, until she seemed to\nforce herself upright with willpower. Caleb sighed. &ldquo;Nott, do you\nwant me to carry you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t worry\nabout me!&rdquo; chirped Nott, blinking a few more times.
