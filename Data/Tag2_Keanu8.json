You\u2019d both frequented the hotel after all. It was where you and John had actually met. </p><p>He was an infamous hitman, who found sanctuary at the hotel a lot when he was hurt. You worked there as a doctor, helping all of the injured who came in and requested assistance. You\u2019d worked on John enough to know the man pretty well. Well, more than most knew him. He was pretty reserved so he didn\u2019t offer much about himself, but that changed. Seeing each other as much as you two did was bound to make something happen between you two.</p><p>You started out fast and heavy. You skipped the whole dating stage and skipped right into the intimacy stage. You\u2019d seen each other enough to know each other enough so why not? You hadn\u2019t really expected much to come out of it. Just some fun with the handsome hitman that frequented the Continental and that\u2019s how it was at first, but things developed between you two. It blindsided you both. You were falling for him and he was falling for you so you made it official.</p><p>As time went on, you both started expressing your desires for some normalcy. You longed for a life that didn\u2019t involve patching up assassins and John longed for one where he no longer had to kill. You both also longed for a family of your very own. You ended up leaving the Continental and John left the business. You found a home together, eventually married, and even welcomed a couple of kids into the world.</p><p>\u201cYou sure we should be bringing them here?\u201d You asked John as you held your two year old son, Benjamin.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d John asked as he held the hand of your five year old daughter, Sophia. \u201cNo one will mess with us. I just thought we should bring them here to meet everyone.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged as you looked at the door. John was right. No one would mess with you. You had been highly respected since you helped out a lot of people and everyone pretty much feared the Baba Yaga. Still, you had your apprehensions with taking your children into the Continental Hotel. It was basically a safe haven for elite assassins. You were a part of their group though even if you and John were no longer working amongst them.</p><p>John stepped up to the door and opened it, waiting for you to walk inside. You stepped in as you still held Benjamin and John stepped in with Sophia. The place was bustling, which is how it had always been. You could spot some familiar faces and also saw some not so familiar.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, what are we doing here?\u201d Sophia asked as she tugged on her father\u2019s hand.</p><p>John knelt down in front of Sophia and smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re just here for a visit, Soph. This is where me and mommy first met. Remember me telling you about that?\u201d</p><p>Sophia thought for a moment then nodded her little head. She was the spitting image of you, but her dark hair came from her father. Benjamin was his father through and through. He was looking around at his surrounding curiously as he clung onto your shirt.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wick and Ms. Y/M/N, what a nice surprise,\u201d someone greeted you. \u201cOr should I say Mrs. Wick now.\u201d</p><p>You turned as John stood up straight again and found none other than Charon, the concierge of the Continental. You assumed he would still be working there, but you were still nicely surprised. You really liked Charon. He had always been very kind and accommodating with you and John both.</p><p>\u201cCharon, hey,\u201d you greeted him with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be anywhere else,\u201d he replied. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you two since the wedding. How have things been? Busy I assume.\u201d He glanced at each of your children.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d John replied with a smile. \u201cWe thought we would drop by with the kids. This is Sophia and Benjamin. Sophia and Benjamin, that\u2019s Charon. He\u2019s an old friend of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Charon,\u201d Sophia greeted him and waved at him. \u201cI\u2019m Sophia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Sophia,\u201d Charon replied and smiled. \u201cWelcome to the Continental. You look just like your mother.\u201d He looked from her and then to Benjamin, who was looking right back at him. \u201cAnd you look just like your father. Are you going to grow up to be like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not,\u201d John replied.</p><p>Charon raised a brow before Winston came into view, walking your way with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t John and Y/N Wick,\u201d Winston said when he was stood in front of all of you. \u201cSomeone told me the Baba Yaga, himself, was out here, but I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>John cleared his throat at the nickname. He didn\u2019t like to be called that anymore. Especially around his children. They didn\u2019t know anything about his old profession and he planned to keep it that way for as long as he could. Sure, they were at the Continental Hotel, but the children didn\u2019t know what they were surrounded by.</p><p>\u201cWho are these little ones?\u201d Winston went on to ask.</p><p>\u201cThis is Benjamin and that is Sophia,\u201d you told him. \u201cKids, this is Winston. He\u2019s another old friend of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and daddy had a lot of friends,\u201d Sophia said.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that I suppose,\u201d John replied as he held Sophia\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your daddy and mommy up to these days?\u201d Winston asked Sophia as he looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cMommy is a school teacher and daddy owns a garage!\u201d She told him. \u201cHe fixes cool cars. Fast cars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVroom vroom,\u201d Benjamin said at the sound of cars.</p><p>You giggled at that and kissed his cheek. He was a little cutie. He didn\u2019t like to talk too much. He much preferred observing things around him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that must be fun,\u201d Winston said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt is!\u201d Sophia exclaimed. \u201cYou have cool hair, Mr. Winston.\u201d</p><p>Winston smiled even more at that and ran a hand through his hair, proudly. He\u2019d always prided himself in his hair.</p><p>\u201cFlattery will get you everywhere, little Sophia,\u201d Winston said. \u201cHow about we go and get you and your brother both some ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s face lit up before she looked at John. \u201cCan we, daddy? Please?!\u201d</p><p>He looked over at you and you nodded. He looked back down at Sophia.</p><p>\u201cAlright, but we\u2019re coming with you,\u201d John said. He wasn\u2019t about to let his children out of his sight no matter how much he trusted Winston. Plus, he enjoyed ice cream too. \u201cCan\u2019t pass up the offer of some ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d Winston said and held his hand out for Sophia, who took it and skipped along with him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to love Winston more than me now,\u201d John joked as he took Benjamin and you both followed along.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re her father and you spoil her all the time,\u201d you told him as you held his hand in yours.</p><p>\u201cYeah, plus&hellip;I\u2019m the Baba Yaga,\u201d John whispered to you and wiggled his eyebrows.</p><p>You giggled and hit his arm playfully. Maybe he did still like being known as the boogeyman. He knew it would come in handy when his daughter started dating and he had to scare off her dates. </p>",

You were falling for him and he was falling for you so you made it official.</p><p>As time went on, you both started expressing your desires for some normalcy. You longed for a life that didn\u2019t involve patching up assassins and John longed for one where he no longer had to kill. You both also longed for a family of your very own. You ended up leaving the Continental and John left the business. You found a home together, eventually married, and even welcomed a couple of kids into the world.</p><p>\u201cYou sure we should be bringing them here?\u201d You asked John as you held your two year old son, Benjamin.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d John asked as he held the hand of your five year old daughter, Sophia. \u201cNo one will mess with us. I just thought we should bring them here to meet everyone.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged as you looked at the door. John was right. No one would mess with you. You had been highly respected since you helped out a lot of people and everyone pretty much feared the Baba Yaga. Still, you had your apprehensions with taking your children into the Continental Hotel. It was basically a safe haven for elite assassins. You were a part of their group though even if you and John were no longer working amongst them.</p><p>John stepped up to the door and opened it, waiting for you to walk inside. You stepped in as you still held Benjamin and John stepped in with Sophia. The place was bustling, which is how it had always been. You could spot some familiar faces and also saw some not so familiar.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, what are we doing here?\u201d Sophia asked as she tugged on her father\u2019s hand.</p><p>John knelt down in front of Sophia and smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re just here for a visit, Soph. This is where me and mommy first met. Remember me telling you about that?\u201d</p><p>Sophia thought for a moment then nodded her little head. She was the spitting image of you, but her dark hair came from her father. Benjamin was his father through and through. He was looking around at his surrounding curiously as he clung onto your shirt.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wick and Ms. Y/M/N, what a nice surprise,\u201d someone greeted you. \u201cOr should I say Mrs. Wick now.\u201d</p><p>You turned as John stood up straight again and found none other than Charon, the concierge of the Continental. You assumed he would still be working there, but you were still nicely surprised. You really liked Charon. He had always been very kind and accommodating with you and John both.</p><p>\u201cCharon, hey,\u201d you greeted him with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be anywhere else,\u201d he replied. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you two since the wedding. How have things been? Busy I assume.\u201d He glanced at each of your children.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d John replied with a smile. \u201cWe thought we would drop by with the kids. This is Sophia and Benjamin. Sophia and Benjamin, that\u2019s Charon. He\u2019s an old friend of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Charon,\u201d Sophia greeted him and waved at him. \u201cI\u2019m Sophia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Sophia,\u201d Charon replied and smiled. \u201cWelcome to the Continental. You look just like your mother.\u201d He looked from her and then to Benjamin, who was looking right back at him. \u201cAnd you look just like your father. Are you going to grow up to be like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not,\u201d John replied.</p><p>Charon raised a brow before Winston came into view, walking your way with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t John and Y/N Wick,\u201d Winston said when he was stood in front of all of you. \u201cSomeone told me the Baba Yaga, himself, was out here, but I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>John cleared his throat at the nickname. He didn\u2019t like to be called that anymore. Especially around his children. They didn\u2019t know anything about his old profession and he planned to keep it that way for as long as he could. Sure, they were at the Continental Hotel, but the children didn\u2019t know what they were surrounded by.</p><p>\u201cWho are these little ones?\u201d Winston went on to ask.</p><p>\u201cThis is Benjamin and that is Sophia,\u201d you told him. \u201cKids, this is Winston. He\u2019s another old friend of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and daddy had a lot of friends,\u201d Sophia said.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that I suppose,\u201d John replied as he held Sophia\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your daddy and mommy up to these days?\u201d Winston asked Sophia as he looked down at her.</p><p>\u201cMommy is a school teacher and daddy owns a garage!\u201d She told him. \u201cHe fixes cool cars. Fast cars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVroom vroom,\u201d Benjamin said at the sound of cars.</p><p>You giggled at that and kissed his cheek. He was a little cutie. He didn\u2019t like to talk too much. He much preferred observing things around him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that must be fun,\u201d Winston said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt is!\u201d Sophia exclaimed. \u201cYou have cool hair, Mr. Winston.\u201d</p><p>Winston smiled even more at that and ran a hand through his hair, proudly. He\u2019d always prided himself in his hair.</p><p>\u201cFlattery will get you everywhere, little Sophia,\u201d Winston said. \u201cHow about we go and get you and your brother both some ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s face lit up before she looked at John. \u201cCan we, daddy? Please?!\u201d</p><p>He looked over at you and you nodded. He looked back down at Sophia.</p><p>\u201cAlright, but we\u2019re coming with you,\u201d John said. He wasn\u2019t about to let his children out of his sight no matter how much he trusted Winston. Plus, he enjoyed ice cream too. \u201cCan\u2019t pass up the offer of some ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d Winston said and held his hand out for Sophia, who took it and skipped along with him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to love Winston more than me now,\u201d John joked as he took Benjamin and you both followed along.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re her father and you spoil her all the time,\u201d you told him as you held his hand in yours.</p><p>\u201cYeah, plus\u2026I\u2019m the Baba Yaga,\u201d John whispered to you and wiggled his eyebrows.</p><p>You giggled and hit his arm playfully. Maybe he did still like being known as the boogeyman. He knew it would come in handy when his daughter started dating and he had to scare off her dates. </p></p>",
