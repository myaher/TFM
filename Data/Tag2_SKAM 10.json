I guess it\u2019s not terrible.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>It was a long, mostly sleepless night for Lucas. He can\u2019t be sure because he couldn\u2019t see Eliott\u2019s face but he was also restless all night long.</p><p>It\u2019s his aunt\u2019s wedding tonight and he didn\u2019t tell Eliott about it yet. The original plan was to just go by himself, play a few songs and enjoy the party, then he met Eliott and the plan turned into going there, spend a few hours with his family and <g class=\"gr_ gr_320 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"320\" data-gr-id=\"320\">rush</g> back to Eliott\u2019s arms. But now he wants Eliott there with him, can\u2019t afford spending hours away from him while he has a choice.</p><p>He can\u2019t help a dumb smile on his lips thinking about Eliott wearing formal clothes, meeting his mom and his family. Eliott is so incredibly handsome, he\u2019ll be the main subject of the wedding after the bride and the groom.</p><p>Lucas closes his eyes when he notices Eliott finally moving, rubbing his eyes. He can feel the bed moving and Eliott is looking at him, coming closer.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re awake, stalker.\u201d Lucas frowns, opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know ?\u201d Eliott laughs and Lucas comes closer, putting one leg around his waist, pulling him even closer, resting his hand on Eliott&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou barely slept tonight. What are you thinking about?\u201d He puts one hand on the small of Lucas\u2019 back and the other one on the top of his head, combing his hair, looking at his fingers running through the strands on hair.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk\u2026\u201d Lucas looks down, his fingertips touching the small tattoo on Eliott\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d He just nods with his head, thinking about how to say it and what Eliott\u2019s reaction will be.</p><p>\u201cI have a wedding to go later today. That\u2019s why I came here. It\u2019s my aunt\u2019s wedding and I took the opportunity to come a few days earlier to relax a little&hellip;And I want you to come with <g class=\"gr_ gr_318 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"318\" data-gr-id=\"318\">me,</g> if you want to.\u201d Eliott smiles, pressing his hand against Lucas\u2019 back, pulling him closer and Lucas hooks his leg perfectly around Eliott\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want me there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucas looks up to meet his eyes again and he doesn\u2019t seem bothered or insecure about it. Eliott&rsquo;s eyes are still soft and inviting.</p><p>\u201cOk. I\u2019ll go with you. But I need to buy clothes.\u201d He talks so easily about it like he really wants to go. Lucas looks for any doubt in his expression for another second, he doesn\u2019t want Eliott to feel uncomfortable but he seems ok with it.</p><p>\u201cOk. We can go shopping.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is taking forever inside the fitting room. He tried a bunch of clothes but he didn&rsquo;t seem happy in any of them, even though he looked fantastic in all.</p><p>Lucas could tell that he was getting a little anxious about deciding which one he should buy so he helped him and the final choice was black trousers, a black button shirt and a leather jacket that he really wanted.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok in there?\u201d Lucas decides to ask, getting up, stopping close to the door and Eliott instantly opens it, looking like a scared wild animal holding his purchase on one hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d He smiles but it doesn\u2019t go all the way to his eyes like usually happens. Lucas stands on his tiptoes, putting his hands on Eliott\u2019s chest, kissing him softly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done now. It wasn\u2019t that bad. And now we can go back to the hotel! We can eat a little, spend some time together, take a shower\u2026\u201d Eliott tries another smile, nodding his head and putting both hands on Lucas\u2019 cheeks, kissing him again.</p><p>-</p><p>Deep inside Eliott notices his feelings creeping up on him, very slowly climbing to the surface, making everything black and numb.</p><p>He wanted to go to this wedding with Lucas but now he doesn\u2019t want anymore. There\u2019ll be a bunch of strangers in there, in a small place, drinking and partying the night away while he doesn\u2019t feel like it. He doesn\u2019t feel like doing anything right now.</p><p>He\u2019ll meet Lucas\u2019 family and they\u2019ll look at Eliott and see how Lucas deserves better. Even if he&rsquo;s just a plus one to some aunt\u2019s wedding he doesn\u2019t really care about. Lucas is also nervous, biting his nails while putting his fancy clothes on, looking at Eliott through the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go.\u201d It\u2019s not a question and Lucas can read him so well it\u2019s the weirdest thing. But he needs to go, needs to man up for once and do what others expect from him.</p><p>\u201cI want to, it\u2019s just hard to get out of bed and put clothes on when there\u2019s a hot guy as you right next to me, putting his fancy, sexy clothes on.\u201d Lucas exhales relieved, turning to really look at Eliott, putting his black suit and it fits him perfectly. Eliott needs to get up and put some clothes on or they\u2019ll be late. He needs to try harder.</p><p>And so he does, doing everything consciously or he would let his body take him back to the bed and stay there for days.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cCan we hold hands tonight or we\u2019re just friends?\u201d He asks and Lucas stops buttoning up Eliott\u2019s shirt, looking up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eliott tries to give him a smile but it doesn\u2019t work again.</p><p>\u201cCan we hold hands tonight?\u201d Lucas seems upset by the question, finishing his task and stepping back before answering.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, we can, if you want to.\u201d He can only force himself to nod, pulling Lucas closer again, kissing him just to make the other one happy and soft again and it works, Lucas melts into him like he always does and he seems to forget about the question.</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is trying to play his uplifting and social self while walking around the place, constantly holding Lucas\u2019 hand or at least his index and middle finger when they walk to the bar or to get more food.</p><p>The ceremony was beautiful, Lucas told him that he knew how to play the song on the piano and Eliott didn\u2019t even know he was able to play the piano.</p><p>Apparently, Lucas thinks he was invited just to play at the party. He doesn\u2019t really see his family, everyone sort of disappeared when Lucas\u2019 parents got divorced and he\u2019s used to it by now, couldn\u2019t care less about his family but his aunt acted like she cared enough and even paid for his trip to the wedding so he accepted.</p><p>It seemed like a fair trade: to play a few songs in exchange for a train ticket and some money for the hotel and free wedding food that Lucas is indulging in a lot. Eliott isn\u2019t hungry, just drinking a few beers and Lucas doesn\u2019t complain about his lack of appetite, he&rsquo;s too worried about the time.</p><p>The dinner was already served, everyone was starting to get drunk and his aunt was looking around, probably searching for him.</p><p>\u201cShit. Guess I have to go.\u201d Lucas buttons up his shirt again, putting his suit as well, putting a hand on top of Eliott\u2019s, caressing the back of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be ok here by yourself? It\u2019s just a few songs and then I\u2019ll be back and we can go back to the hotel.\u201d Eliott just nods, trying to smile for the third time to Lucas and he gets a quick kiss on the lips as an answer.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d He manages to say before Lucas leaves him by himself at their table. He manages to finish his and Lucas\u2019 beer while he watches the other one walking to the small stage, fixing his clothes and hair.</p><p>-</p><p>For the first time, Lucas feels in control. These last couple of magical days with Eliott were all about doing what the other one suggested. He had just as much fun but he wanted to show Eliott how happy he was to spend this time with him and to take him as his plus one to the wedding.</p><p>He\u2019ll have to go back to Paris in a few days and they didn\u2019t talk about it and he didn\u2019t think about it until now, on his way to the piano. Lucas doesn\u2019t know what will happen, he doesn\u2019t even know if Eliott lives in Paris as well.</p><p>It\u2019s been such a long time since he played the piano for the last time but he thought about which song he wanted to play. He still knows a few songs but he needs to play his favorite one, it\u2019s powerful and until today that was it, but now it has a different meaning to him. Even if they don\u2019t have time to say it or to explain their feelings, he\u2019ll show his to Eliott.</p><p>Lucas sits on the bench, pulling it closer to the piano, breathing slowly, trying not to fuck everything up. He looks back one more time where he left Eliott. He nods quietly trying to give Lucas some type of reassurance. Eliott is still alone at their table so that\u2019s good. Nobody went to sit with him and talk about Lucas being gay or something stupid like that.</p><p>Eliott looks like a God wearing all black, everything fits him perfectly. His pupils were still blown when Lucas left him a minute ago, maybe it was a bad idea to smoke on their way to the wedding but they were both nervous and a bit shaky and Lucas couldn\u2019t think of a better opportunity to finally smoke Arthur\u2019s weed. Eliott also seemed relieved to have something to smoke and make them relax a little bit.</p><p>Every girl and some guys around their age attending the wedding seem to be looking at Eliott but he never leaves Lucas\u2019 eyes, biting his nails.</p><p>He\u2019s with me tonight.</p><p>Lucas forces himself to look at the piano, forget about everyone else but Eliott. He puts his hair back, touching the keys quietly for a second, making sure that it\u2019s there and it\u2019s happening, praying that everything will go perfectly.</p><p>The room slowly goes quiet, you can only hear whispers and a few chairs being dragged against the floor and someone coughing. And then he starts playing.</p><p>Soon he\u2019s letting himself be pulled by the music and the notes, thinking about what it all means to him right now. His heart is racing, his body is overheating but it feels good, like certainty about his feeling and about his company tonight. Eliott.</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is having a very hard time. He\u2019s exhausted, maybe the lack of sleep from the past days are catching up to him. He doesn\u2019t dare thinking about his medication left behind in Paris. It\u2019s probably still on his nightstand, staring at his empty bed for days, blaming him again for forgetting about getting the small flask before leaving the house.</p><p>It\u2019s been years and he still forgets about it. Maybe deep down he hopes he\u2019ll be able to live his life without having some kind of drug controlling him when he doesn\u2019t feel like being under control.</p><p>He\u2019s never been as happy as he\u2019s been these days hiding from everyone else. He\u2019s with Lucas and that\u2019s all that matters. But he\u2019s aware of the thousands of messages unread of his phone, the missed calls and the voice messages that Lucille left him. She can\u2019t leave him alone. Ever.</p><p>The moment he saw Lucas on that train station he knew his heart was taken. By the most beautiful human being and he couldn\u2019t fuck this up, not today. At his aunt\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Eliott could easily marry Lucas right now. If it was the hardest decision of his past life with Lucille it would be the easiest to just marry his boyfriend tonight and spend their lives together, running away all around the world, constantly traveling, tasting the best food, sleeping on the most comfortable beds, making love every night.</p><p>He thanks the waiter when he finally brings more drinks, putting it on the table, taking the empty dirty plates and cups with him. Lucas is still playing so Eliott empties the new drinks, putting the empty cups back on the table. He can feel his hands cold but sweaty and his body buzzing with energy. He can\u2019t wait to go back to the hotel.</p><p>Lucas is suddenly by his side, the live music stopped playing, he looks around and the other guests are still applauding Lucas but everyone is moving around close to the dance floor to join the newlyweds.</p><p>\u201cCan we go <g class=\"gr_ gr_340 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"340\" data-gr-id=\"340\">home ?</g> I don\u2019t feel good.\u201d He manages to explain, already getting up, feels like the world is spinning around him. Lucas frowns, nodding and coming closer, hugging him by his waist, guiding him out of the party.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201c Cause it&rsquo;s a beautiful night, we&rsquo;re looking for something dumb to do</p><p>Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you</p><p>Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice</p><p>Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you\u201d</p><p>He whispers against Lucas\u2019 ear making the other one laugh, holding his waist tighter. They\u2019re out of the party, walking on empty streets to their hotel.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you drank while I was playing ?\u201d Lucas teases him and he just rolls his eyes. He\u2019s not drunk.</p><p>\u201cNot enough. I\u2019m not drunk, I just think this is a party song and it fits the moment.\u201d He shrugs, holding Lucas tighter. He\u2019s trying very hard not to ruin his night, his vacation. If they were married, he would have to tell Lucas everything.</p><p>He knows about him being bipolar but Eliott is not sure if Lucas understands what it means. He\u2019s definitely not ready and he doesn\u2019t have to be, Eliott wants Lucas to be happy, not a worrier that would become his nurse and he would lose interest in Eliott.</p><p>\u201c If we wake up and you want to break up</p><p>That&rsquo;s cool</p><p><g class=\"gr_ gr_291 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"291\" data-gr-id=\"291\">No</g> I won&rsquo;t blame you</p><p>It was fun, Lucas .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how the song goes.\u201d Lucas comes closer again, hiding his face against Eliott\u2019s neck, kissing it and putting both arms around his waist to steady the other one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I want this song to play at our wedding.\u201d Lucas makes them stop, looking up. Eliott can see him again, his cheeks starting to blush and he\u2019s trying to hold back a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re getting married ?\u201d Eliott frowns, putting both hands on his face, brushing his lips against Lucas\u2019.</p><p>\u201cOf course we are. A big fucking wedding. I wanna marry you, Lucas.\u201d Lucas looks up to meet his gaze, he opens his mouth a few times but never says a word. \u201cI would marry you right now if you wanted as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-We can get married sometime in the future.\u201d Eliott chews his bottom lip, stepping back and starting to walk again, finally arriving at their hotel.</p><p>Lucas is still looking at him, trying to ask for forgiveness without saying and without needing to apologize. Eliott is stupid for even talking about marriage when he left his ex when just the idea of getting engaged to her became a reality.</p><p>\u201cEliott\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lucas, it was just a stupid idea.\u201d He locks the bedroom door after Lucas, taking his new clothes off and leaving in a pile right next to the door, he\u2019s exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI-I like you. Really like you.\u201d Eliott passes by him on the way to the bed, taking his underwear off when he\u2019s under the covers, Lucas is still where he was a minute ago, looking like he\u2019s about to cry, ashamed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m a whole lot of problems and it\u2019s so fucked up, no wonder why you wouldn\u2019t marry me, I get it, I know I\u2019m asking too much. I need to sleep, we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d He doesn\u2019t let Lucas answer him, making it clear that the conversation is over when he covers himself completely with the covers, trying to stay still so Lucas won\u2019t bother him.</p><p>The room is silent for a long time, Eliott is trying to keep <g class=\"gr_ gr_323 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"323\" data-gr-id=\"323\">his</g> breathe slow so he won\u2019t start sobbing and call Lucas&rsquo; attention to <g class=\"gr_ gr_326 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"326\" data-gr-id=\"326\">come</g> see what\u2019s going on. The other one finally moves, walking around the room but Eliott doesn\u2019t bother looking what he\u2019s doing, he closes his eyes, trying to fall asleep for a little. Soon it will all be over and Lucas won\u2019t even remember they existed.</p><p>And Eliott will be the one thinking about it while he walks up the aisle to marry the girl he doesn\u2019t want. He finally closes his eyes, hoping to be able to fall asleep tonight.</p>",

The original plan was to just go by himself, play a few songs and enjoy the party, then he met Eliott and the plan turned into going there, spend a few hours with his family and <g class=\"gr_ gr_320 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"320\" data-gr-id=\"320\">rush</g> back to Eliott\u2019s arms. But now he wants Eliott there with him, can\u2019t afford spending hours away from him while he has a choice.</p><p>He can\u2019t help a dumb smile on his lips thinking about Eliott wearing formal clothes, meeting his mom and his family. Eliott is so incredibly handsome, he\u2019ll be the main subject of the wedding after the bride and the groom.</p><p>Lucas closes his eyes when he notices Eliott finally moving, rubbing his eyes. He can feel the bed moving and Eliott is looking at him, coming closer.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re awake, stalker.\u201d Lucas frowns, opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know ?\u201d Eliott laughs and Lucas comes closer, putting one leg around his waist, pulling him even closer, resting his hand on Eliott\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou barely slept tonight. What are you thinking about?\u201d He puts one hand on the small of Lucas\u2019 back and the other one on the top of his head, combing his hair, looking at his fingers running through the strands on hair.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk\u2026\u201d Lucas looks down, his fingertips touching the small tattoo on Eliott\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d He just nods with his head, thinking about how to say it and what Eliott\u2019s reaction will be.</p><p>\u201cI have a wedding to go later today. That\u2019s why I came here. It\u2019s my aunt\u2019s wedding and I took the opportunity to come a few days earlier to relax a little\u2026And I want you to come with <g class=\"gr_ gr_318 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"318\" data-gr-id=\"318\">me,</g> if you want to.\u201d Eliott smiles, pressing his hand against Lucas\u2019 back, pulling him closer and Lucas hooks his leg perfectly around Eliott\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want me there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucas looks up to meet his eyes again and he doesn\u2019t seem bothered or insecure about it. Eliott\u2019s eyes are still soft and inviting.</p><p>\u201cOk. I\u2019ll go with you. But I need to buy clothes.\u201d He talks so easily about it like he really wants to go. Lucas looks for any doubt in his expression for another second, he doesn\u2019t want Eliott to feel uncomfortable but he seems ok with it.</p><p>\u201cOk. We can go shopping.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is taking forever inside the fitting room. He tried a bunch of clothes but he didn\u2019t seem happy in any of them, even though he looked fantastic in all.</p><p>Lucas could tell that he was getting a little anxious about deciding which one he should buy so he helped him and the final choice was black trousers, a black button shirt and a leather jacket that he really wanted.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok in there?\u201d Lucas decides to ask, getting up, stopping close to the door and Eliott instantly opens it, looking like a scared wild animal holding his purchase on one hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d He smiles but it doesn\u2019t go all the way to his eyes like usually happens. Lucas stands on his tiptoes, putting his hands on Eliott\u2019s chest, kissing him softly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done now. It wasn\u2019t that bad. And now we can go back to the hotel! We can eat a little, spend some time together, take a shower\u2026\u201d Eliott tries another smile, nodding his head and putting both hands on Lucas\u2019 cheeks, kissing him again.</p><p>-</p><p>Deep inside Eliott notices his feelings creeping up on him, very slowly climbing to the surface, making everything black and numb.</p><p>He wanted to go to this wedding with Lucas but now he doesn\u2019t want anymore. There\u2019ll be a bunch of strangers in there, in a small place, drinking and partying the night away while he doesn\u2019t feel like it. He doesn\u2019t feel like doing anything right now.</p><p>He\u2019ll meet Lucas\u2019 family and they\u2019ll look at Eliott and see how Lucas deserves better. Even if he\u2019s just a plus one to some aunt\u2019s wedding he doesn\u2019t really care about. Lucas is also nervous, biting his nails while putting his fancy clothes on, looking at Eliott through the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go.\u201d It\u2019s not a question and Lucas can read him so well it\u2019s the weirdest thing. But he needs to go, needs to man up for once and do what others expect from him.</p><p>\u201cI want to, it\u2019s just hard to get out of bed and put clothes on when there\u2019s a hot guy as you right next to me, putting his fancy, sexy clothes on.\u201d Lucas exhales relieved, turning to really look at Eliott, putting his black suit and it fits him perfectly. Eliott needs to get up and put some clothes on or they\u2019ll be late. He needs to try harder.</p><p>And so he does, doing everything consciously or he would let his body take him back to the bed and stay there for days.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cCan we hold hands tonight or we\u2019re just friends?\u201d He asks and Lucas stops buttoning up Eliott\u2019s shirt, looking up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eliott tries to give him a smile but it doesn\u2019t work again.</p><p>\u201cCan we hold hands tonight?\u201d Lucas seems upset by the question, finishing his task and stepping back before answering.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, we can, if you want to.\u201d He can only force himself to nod, pulling Lucas closer again, kissing him just to make the other one happy and soft again and it works, Lucas melts into him like he always does and he seems to forget about the question.</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is trying to play his uplifting and social self while walking around the place, constantly holding Lucas\u2019 hand or at least his index and middle finger when they walk to the bar or to get more food.</p><p>The ceremony was beautiful, Lucas told him that he knew how to play the song on the piano and Eliott didn\u2019t even know he was able to play the piano.</p><p>Apparently, Lucas thinks he was invited just to play at the party. He doesn\u2019t really see his family, everyone sort of disappeared when Lucas\u2019 parents got divorced and he\u2019s used to it by now, couldn\u2019t care less about his family but his aunt acted like she cared enough and even paid for his trip to the wedding so he accepted.</p><p>It seemed like a fair trade: to play a few songs in exchange for a train ticket and some money for the hotel and free wedding food that Lucas is indulging in a lot. Eliott isn\u2019t hungry, just drinking a few beers and Lucas doesn\u2019t complain about his lack of appetite, he\u2019s too worried about the time.</p><p>The dinner was already served, everyone was starting to get drunk and his aunt was looking around, probably searching for him.</p><p>\u201cShit. Guess I have to go.\u201d Lucas buttons up his shirt again, putting his suit as well, putting a hand on top of Eliott\u2019s, caressing the back of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be ok here by yourself? It\u2019s just a few songs and then I\u2019ll be back and we can go back to the hotel.\u201d Eliott just nods, trying to smile for the third time to Lucas and he gets a quick kiss on the lips as an answer.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d He manages to say before Lucas leaves him by himself at their table. He manages to finish his and Lucas\u2019 beer while he watches the other one walking to the small stage, fixing his clothes and hair.</p><p>-</p><p>For the first time, Lucas feels in control. These last couple of magical days with Eliott were all about doing what the other one suggested. He had just as much fun but he wanted to show Eliott how happy he was to spend this time with him and to take him as his plus one to the wedding.</p><p>He\u2019ll have to go back to Paris in a few days and they didn\u2019t talk about it and he didn\u2019t think about it until now, on his way to the piano. Lucas doesn\u2019t know what will happen, he doesn\u2019t even know if Eliott lives in Paris as well.</p><p>It\u2019s been such a long time since he played the piano for the last time but he thought about which song he wanted to play. He still knows a few songs but he needs to play his favorite one, it\u2019s powerful and until today that was it, but now it has a different meaning to him. Even if they don\u2019t have time to say it or to explain their feelings, he\u2019ll show his to Eliott.</p><p>Lucas sits on the bench, pulling it closer to the piano, breathing slowly, trying not to fuck everything up. He looks back one more time where he left Eliott. He nods quietly trying to give Lucas some type of reassurance. Eliott is still alone at their table so that\u2019s good. Nobody went to sit with him and talk about Lucas being gay or something stupid like that.</p><p>Eliott looks like a God wearing all black, everything fits him perfectly. His pupils were still blown when Lucas left him a minute ago, maybe it was a bad idea to smoke on their way to the wedding but they were both nervous and a bit shaky and Lucas couldn\u2019t think of a better opportunity to finally smoke Arthur\u2019s weed. Eliott also seemed relieved to have something to smoke and make them relax a little bit.</p><p>Every girl and some guys around their age attending the wedding seem to be looking at Eliott but he never leaves Lucas\u2019 eyes, biting his nails.</p><p>He\u2019s with me tonight.</p><p>Lucas forces himself to look at the piano, forget about everyone else but Eliott. He puts his hair back, touching the keys quietly for a second, making sure that it\u2019s there and it\u2019s happening, praying that everything will go perfectly.</p><p>The room slowly goes quiet, you can only hear whispers and a few chairs being dragged against the floor and someone coughing. And then he starts playing.</p><p>Soon he\u2019s letting himself be pulled by the music and the notes, thinking about what it all means to him right now. His heart is racing, his body is overheating but it feels good, like certainty about his feeling and about his company tonight. Eliott.</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is having a very hard time. He\u2019s exhausted, maybe the lack of sleep from the past days are catching up to him. He doesn\u2019t dare thinking about his medication left behind in Paris. It\u2019s probably still on his nightstand, staring at his empty bed for days, blaming him again for forgetting about getting the small flask before leaving the house.</p><p>It\u2019s been years and he still forgets about it. Maybe deep down he hopes he\u2019ll be able to live his life without having some kind of drug controlling him when he doesn\u2019t feel like being under control.</p><p>He\u2019s never been as happy as he\u2019s been these days hiding from everyone else. He\u2019s with Lucas and that\u2019s all that matters. But he\u2019s aware of the thousands of messages unread of his phone, the missed calls and the voice messages that Lucille left him. She can\u2019t leave him alone. Ever.</p><p>The moment he saw Lucas on that train station he knew his heart was taken. By the most beautiful human being and he couldn\u2019t fuck this up, not today. At his aunt\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Eliott could easily marry Lucas right now. If it was the hardest decision of his past life with Lucille it would be the easiest to just marry his boyfriend tonight and spend their lives together, running away all around the world, constantly traveling, tasting the best food, sleeping on the most comfortable beds, making love every night.</p><p>He thanks the waiter when he finally brings more drinks, putting it on the table, taking the empty dirty plates and cups with him. Lucas is still playing so Eliott empties the new drinks, putting the empty cups back on the table. He can feel his hands cold but sweaty and his body buzzing with energy. He can\u2019t wait to go back to the hotel.</p><p>Lucas is suddenly by his side, the live music stopped playing, he looks around and the other guests are still applauding Lucas but everyone is moving around close to the dance floor to join the newlyweds.</p><p>\u201cCan we go <g class=\"gr_ gr_340 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"340\" data-gr-id=\"340\">home ?</g> I don\u2019t feel good.\u201d He manages to explain, already getting up, feels like the world is spinning around him. Lucas frowns, nodding and coming closer, hugging him by his waist, guiding him out of the party.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201c Cause it\u2019s a beautiful night, we\u2019re looking for something dumb to do</p><p>Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you</p><p>Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice</p><p>Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you\u201d</p><p>He whispers against Lucas\u2019 ear making the other one laugh, holding his waist tighter. They\u2019re out of the party, walking on empty streets to their hotel.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you drank while I was playing ?\u201d Lucas teases him and he just rolls his eyes. He\u2019s not drunk.</p><p>\u201cNot enough. I\u2019m not drunk, I just think this is a party song and it fits the moment.\u201d He shrugs, holding Lucas tighter. He\u2019s trying very hard not to ruin his night, his vacation. If they were married, he would have to tell Lucas everything.</p><p>He knows about him being bipolar but Eliott is not sure if Lucas understands what it means. He\u2019s definitely not ready and he doesn\u2019t have to be, Eliott wants Lucas to be happy, not a worrier that would become his nurse and he would lose interest in Eliott.</p><p>\u201c If we wake up and you want to break up</p><p>That\u2019s cool</p><p><g class=\"gr_ gr_291 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"291\" data-gr-id=\"291\">No</g> I won\u2019t blame you</p><p>It was fun, Lucas .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how the song goes.\u201d Lucas comes closer again, hiding his face against Eliott\u2019s neck, kissing it and putting both arms around his waist to steady the other one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I want this song to play at our wedding.\u201d Lucas makes them stop, looking up. Eliott can see him again, his cheeks starting to blush and he\u2019s trying to hold back a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re getting married ?\u201d Eliott frowns, putting both hands on his face, brushing his lips against Lucas\u2019.</p><p>\u201cOf course we are. A big fucking wedding. I wanna marry you, Lucas.\u201d Lucas looks up to meet his gaze, he opens his mouth a few times but never says a word. \u201cI would marry you right now if you wanted as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-We can get married sometime in the future.\u201d Eliott chews his bottom lip, stepping back and starting to walk again, finally arriving at their hotel.</p><p>Lucas is still looking at him, trying to ask for forgiveness without saying and without needing to apologize. Eliott is stupid for even talking about marriage when he left his ex when just the idea of getting engaged to her became a reality.</p><p>\u201cEliott\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lucas, it was just a stupid idea.\u201d He locks the bedroom door after Lucas, taking his new clothes off and leaving in a pile right next to the door, he\u2019s exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI-I like you. Really like you.\u201d Eliott passes by him on the way to the bed, taking his underwear off when he\u2019s under the covers, Lucas is still where he was a minute ago, looking like he\u2019s about to cry, ashamed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m a whole lot of problems and it\u2019s so fucked up, no wonder why you wouldn\u2019t marry me, I get it, I know I\u2019m asking too much. I need to sleep, we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d He doesn\u2019t let Lucas answer him, making it clear that the conversation is over when he covers himself completely with the covers, trying to stay still so Lucas won\u2019t bother him.</p><p>The room is silent for a long time, Eliott is trying to keep <g class=\"gr_ gr_323 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"323\" data-gr-id=\"323\">his</g> breathe slow so he won\u2019t start sobbing and call Lucas\u2019 attention to <g class=\"gr_ gr_326 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"326\" data-gr-id=\"326\">come</g> see what\u2019s going on. The other one finally moves, walking around the room but Eliott doesn\u2019t bother looking what he\u2019s doing, he closes his eyes, trying to fall asleep for a little. Soon it will all be over and Lucas won\u2019t even remember they existed.</p><p>And Eliott will be the one thinking about it while he walks up the aisle to marry the girl he doesn\u2019t want. He finally closes his eyes, hoping to be able to fall asleep tonight.</p></p>",

He tried a bunch of clothes but he didn\u2019t seem happy in any of them, even though he looked fantastic in all.</p><p>Lucas could tell that he was getting a little anxious about deciding which one he should buy so he helped him and the final choice was black trousers, a black button shirt and a leather jacket that he really wanted.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok in there?\u201d Lucas decides to ask, getting up, stopping close to the door and Eliott instantly opens it, looking like a scared wild animal holding his purchase on one hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d He smiles but it doesn\u2019t go all the way to his eyes like usually happens. Lucas stands on his tiptoes, putting his hands on Eliott\u2019s chest, kissing him softly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done now. It wasn\u2019t that bad. And now we can go back to the hotel! We can eat a little, spend some time together, take a shower\u2026\u201d Eliott tries another smile, nodding his head and putting both hands on Lucas\u2019 cheeks, kissing him again.</p><p>-</p><p>Deep inside Eliott notices his feelings creeping up on him, very slowly climbing to the surface, making everything black and numb.</p><p>He wanted to go to this wedding with Lucas but now he doesn\u2019t want anymore. There\u2019ll be a bunch of strangers in there, in a small place, drinking and partying the night away while he doesn\u2019t feel like it. He doesn\u2019t feel like doing anything right now.</p><p>He\u2019ll meet Lucas\u2019 family and they\u2019ll look at Eliott and see how Lucas deserves better. Even if he\u2019s just a plus one to some aunt\u2019s wedding he doesn\u2019t really care about. Lucas is also nervous, biting his nails while putting his fancy clothes on, looking at Eliott through the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go.\u201d It\u2019s not a question and Lucas can read him so well it\u2019s the weirdest thing. But he needs to go, needs to man up for once and do what others expect from him.</p><p>\u201cI want to, it\u2019s just hard to get out of bed and put clothes on when there\u2019s a hot guy as you right next to me, putting his fancy, sexy clothes on.\u201d Lucas exhales relieved, turning to really look at Eliott, putting his black suit and it fits him perfectly. Eliott needs to get up and put some clothes on or they\u2019ll be late. He needs to try harder.</p><p>And so he does, doing everything consciously or he would let his body take him back to the bed and stay there for days.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cCan we hold hands tonight or we\u2019re just friends?\u201d He asks and Lucas stops buttoning up Eliott\u2019s shirt, looking up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eliott tries to give him a smile but it doesn\u2019t work again.</p><p>\u201cCan we hold hands tonight?\u201d Lucas seems upset by the question, finishing his task and stepping back before answering.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, we can, if you want to.\u201d He can only force himself to nod, pulling Lucas closer again, kissing him just to make the other one happy and soft again and it works, Lucas melts into him like he always does and he seems to forget about the question.</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is trying to play his uplifting and social self while walking around the place, constantly holding Lucas\u2019 hand or at least his index and middle finger when they walk to the bar or to get more food.</p><p>The ceremony was beautiful, Lucas told him that he knew how to play the song on the piano and Eliott didn\u2019t even know he was able to play the piano.</p><p>Apparently, Lucas thinks he was invited just to play at the party. He doesn\u2019t really see his family, everyone sort of disappeared when Lucas\u2019 parents got divorced and he\u2019s used to it by now, couldn\u2019t care less about his family but his aunt acted like she cared enough and even paid for his trip to the wedding so he accepted.</p><p>It seemed like a fair trade: to play a few songs in exchange for a train ticket and some money for the hotel and free wedding food that Lucas is indulging in a lot. Eliott isn\u2019t hungry, just drinking a few beers and Lucas doesn\u2019t complain about his lack of appetite, he\u2019s too worried about the time.</p><p>The dinner was already served, everyone was starting to get drunk and his aunt was looking around, probably searching for him.</p><p>\u201cShit. Guess I have to go.\u201d Lucas buttons up his shirt again, putting his suit as well, putting a hand on top of Eliott\u2019s, caressing the back of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be ok here by yourself? It\u2019s just a few songs and then I\u2019ll be back and we can go back to the hotel.\u201d Eliott just nods, trying to smile for the third time to Lucas and he gets a quick kiss on the lips as an answer.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d He manages to say before Lucas leaves him by himself at their table. He manages to finish his and Lucas\u2019 beer while he watches the other one walking to the small stage, fixing his clothes and hair.</p><p>-</p><p>For the first time, Lucas feels in control. These last couple of magical days with Eliott were all about doing what the other one suggested. He had just as much fun but he wanted to show Eliott how happy he was to spend this time with him and to take him as his plus one to the wedding.</p><p>He\u2019ll have to go back to Paris in a few days and they didn\u2019t talk about it and he didn\u2019t think about it until now, on his way to the piano. Lucas doesn\u2019t know what will happen, he doesn\u2019t even know if Eliott lives in Paris as well.</p><p>It\u2019s been such a long time since he played the piano for the last time but he thought about which song he wanted to play. He still knows a few songs but he needs to play his favorite one, it\u2019s powerful and until today that was it, but now it has a different meaning to him. Even if they don\u2019t have time to say it or to explain their feelings, he\u2019ll show his to Eliott.</p><p>Lucas sits on the bench, pulling it closer to the piano, breathing slowly, trying not to fuck everything up. He looks back one more time where he left Eliott. He nods quietly trying to give Lucas some type of reassurance. Eliott is still alone at their table so that\u2019s good. Nobody went to sit with him and talk about Lucas being gay or something stupid like that.</p><p>Eliott looks like a God wearing all black, everything fits him perfectly. His pupils were still blown when Lucas left him a minute ago, maybe it was a bad idea to smoke on their way to the wedding but they were both nervous and a bit shaky and Lucas couldn\u2019t think of a better opportunity to finally smoke Arthur\u2019s weed. Eliott also seemed relieved to have something to smoke and make them relax a little bit.</p><p>Every girl and some guys around their age attending the wedding seem to be looking at Eliott but he never leaves Lucas\u2019 eyes, biting his nails.</p><p>He\u2019s with me tonight.</p><p>Lucas forces himself to look at the piano, forget about everyone else but Eliott. He puts his hair back, touching the keys quietly for a second, making sure that it\u2019s there and it\u2019s happening, praying that everything will go perfectly.</p><p>The room slowly goes quiet, you can only hear whispers and a few chairs being dragged against the floor and someone coughing. And then he starts playing.</p><p>Soon he\u2019s letting himself be pulled by the music and the notes, thinking about what it all means to him right now. His heart is racing, his body is overheating but it feels good, like certainty about his feeling and about his company tonight. Eliott.</p><p>-</p><p>Eliott is having a very hard time. He\u2019s exhausted, maybe the lack of sleep from the past days are catching up to him. He doesn\u2019t dare thinking about his medication left behind in Paris. It\u2019s probably still on his nightstand, staring at his empty bed for days, blaming him again for forgetting about getting the small flask before leaving the house.</p><p>It\u2019s been years and he still forgets about it. Maybe deep down he hopes he\u2019ll be able to live his life without having some kind of drug controlling him when he doesn\u2019t feel like being under control.</p><p>He\u2019s never been as happy as he\u2019s been these days hiding from everyone else. He\u2019s with Lucas and that\u2019s all that matters. But he\u2019s aware of the thousands of messages unread of his phone, the missed calls and the voice messages that Lucille left him. She can\u2019t leave him alone. Ever.</p><p>The moment he saw Lucas on that train station he knew his heart was taken. By the most beautiful human being and he couldn\u2019t fuck this up, not today. At his aunt\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Eliott could easily marry Lucas right now. If it was the hardest decision of his past life with Lucille it would be the easiest to just marry his boyfriend tonight and spend their lives together, running away all around the world, constantly traveling, tasting the best food, sleeping on the most comfortable beds, making love every night.</p><p>He thanks the waiter when he finally brings more drinks, putting it on the table, taking the empty dirty plates and cups with him. Lucas is still playing so Eliott empties the new drinks, putting the empty cups back on the table. He can feel his hands cold but sweaty and his body buzzing with energy. He can\u2019t wait to go back to the hotel.</p><p>Lucas is suddenly by his side, the live music stopped playing, he looks around and the other guests are still applauding Lucas but everyone is moving around close to the dance floor to join the newlyweds.</p><p>\u201cCan we go <g class=\"gr_ gr_340 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"340\" data-gr-id=\"340\">home ?</g> I don\u2019t feel good.\u201d He manages to explain, already getting up, feels like the world is spinning around him. Lucas frowns, nodding and coming closer, hugging him by his waist, guiding him out of the party.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201c Cause it\u2019s a beautiful night, we\u2019re looking for something dumb to do</p><p>Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you</p><p>Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice</p><p>Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you\u201d</p><p>He whispers against Lucas\u2019 ear making the other one laugh, holding his waist tighter. They\u2019re out of the party, walking on empty streets to their hotel.</p><p>\u201cHow much did you drank while I was playing ?\u201d Lucas teases him and he just rolls his eyes. He\u2019s not drunk.</p><p>\u201cNot enough. I\u2019m not drunk, I just think this is a party song and it fits the moment.\u201d He shrugs, holding Lucas tighter. He\u2019s trying very hard not to ruin his night, his vacation. If they were married, he would have to tell Lucas everything.</p><p>He knows about him being bipolar but Eliott is not sure if Lucas understands what it means. He\u2019s definitely not ready and he doesn\u2019t have to be, Eliott wants Lucas to be happy, not a worrier that would become his nurse and he would lose interest in Eliott.</p><p>\u201c If we wake up and you want to break up</p><p>That\u2019s cool</p><p><g class=\"gr_ gr_291 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"291\" data-gr-id=\"291\">No</g> I won\u2019t blame you</p><p>It was fun, Lucas .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how the song goes.\u201d Lucas comes closer again, hiding his face against Eliott\u2019s neck, kissing it and putting both arms around his waist to steady the other one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I want this song to play at our wedding.\u201d Lucas makes them stop, looking up. Eliott can see him again, his cheeks starting to blush and he\u2019s trying to hold back a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re getting married ?\u201d Eliott frowns, putting both hands on his face, brushing his lips against Lucas\u2019.</p><p>\u201cOf course we are. A big fucking wedding. I wanna marry you, Lucas.\u201d Lucas looks up to meet his gaze, he opens his mouth a few times but never says a word. \u201cI would marry you right now if you wanted as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-We can get married sometime in the future.\u201d Eliott chews his bottom lip, stepping back and starting to walk again, finally arriving at their hotel.</p><p>Lucas is still looking at him, trying to ask for forgiveness without saying and without needing to apologize. Eliott is stupid for even talking about marriage when he left his ex when just the idea of getting engaged to her became a reality.</p><p>\u201cEliott\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lucas, it was just a stupid idea.\u201d He locks the bedroom door after Lucas, taking his new clothes off and leaving in a pile right next to the door, he\u2019s exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI-I like you. Really like you.\u201d Eliott passes by him on the way to the bed, taking his underwear off when he\u2019s under the covers, Lucas is still where he was a minute ago, looking like he\u2019s about to cry, ashamed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m a whole lot of problems and it\u2019s so fucked up, no wonder why you wouldn\u2019t marry me, I get it, I know I\u2019m asking too much. I need to sleep, we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d He doesn\u2019t let Lucas answer him, making it clear that the conversation is over when he covers himself completely with the covers, trying to stay still so Lucas won\u2019t bother him.</p><p>The room is silent for a long time, Eliott is trying to keep <g class=\"gr_ gr_323 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"323\" data-gr-id=\"323\">his</g> breathe slow so he won\u2019t start sobbing and call Lucas\u2019 attention to <g class=\"gr_ gr_326 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"326\" data-gr-id=\"326\">come</g> see what\u2019s going on. The other one finally moves, walking around the room but Eliott doesn\u2019t bother looking what he\u2019s doing, he closes his eyes, trying to fall asleep for a little. Soon it will all be over and Lucas won\u2019t even remember they existed.</p><p>And Eliott will be the one thinking about it while he walks up the aisle to marry the girl he doesn\u2019t want. He finally closes his eyes, hoping to be able to fall asleep tonight.</p></p>",

He can&rsquo;t be sure because he couldn&rsquo;t see Eliott&rsquo;s face but he was also restless all night long.</p><p>It&rsquo;s his aunt&rsquo;s wedding tonight and he didn&rsquo;t tell Eliott about it yet. The original plan was to just go by himself, play a few songs and enjoy the party, then he met Eliott and the plan turned into going there, spend a few hours with his family and rush back to Eliott&rsquo;s arms. But now he wants Eliott there with him, can&rsquo;t afford spending hours away from him while he has a choice.</p><p>He can&rsquo;t help a dumb smile on his lips thinking about Eliott wearing formal clothes, meeting his mom and his family. Eliott is so incredibly handsome, he&rsquo;ll be the main subject of the wedding after the bride and the groom.</p><p>Lucas closes his eyes when he notices Eliott finally moving, rubbing his eyes. He can feel the bed moving and Eliott is looking at him, coming closer.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re awake, stalker.&rdquo; Lucas frowns, opening his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know ?&rdquo; Eliott laughs and Lucas comes closer, putting one leg around his waist, pulling him even closer, resting his hand on Eliott&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;You barely slept tonight. What are you thinking about?&rdquo; He puts one hand on the small of Lucas&rsquo; back and the other one on the top of his head, combing his hair, looking at his fingers running through the strands on hair.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk&hellip;&rdquo; Lucas looks down, his fingertips touching the small tattoo on Eliott&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;We do?&rdquo; He just nods with his head, thinking about how to say it and what Eliott&rsquo;s reaction will be.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a wedding to go later today. That&rsquo;s why I came here. It&rsquo;s my aunt&rsquo;s wedding and I took the opportunity to come a few days earlier to relax a little&hellip;And I want you to come with me, if you want to.&rdquo; Eliott smiles, pressing his hand against Lucas&rsquo; back, pulling him closer and Lucas hooks his leg perfectly around Eliott&rsquo;s waist.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure you want me there with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Lucas looks up to meet his eyes again and he doesn&rsquo;t seem bothered or insecure about it. Eliott&rsquo;s eyes are still soft and inviting.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. I&rsquo;ll go with you. But I need to buy clothes.&rdquo; He talks so easily about it like he really wants to go. Lucas looks for any doubt in his expression for another second, he doesn&rsquo;t want Eliott to feel uncomfortable but he seems ok with it.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok.

He&rsquo;s definitely not ready and he doesn&rsquo;t have to be, Eliott wants Lucas to be happy, not a worrier that would become his nurse and he would lose interest in Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo; If we wake up and you want to break up</p><p>That&rsquo;s cool</p><p>No I won&rsquo;t blame you</p><p>It was fun, Lucas .&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how the song goes.&rdquo; Lucas comes closer again, hiding his face against Eliott&rsquo;s neck, kissing it and putting both arms around his waist to steady the other one.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I want this song to play at our wedding.&rdquo; Lucas makes them stop, looking up. Eliott can see him again, his cheeks starting to blush and he&rsquo;s trying to hold back a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re getting married ?&rdquo; Eliott frowns, putting both hands on his face, brushing his lips against Lucas&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course we are. A big fucking wedding. I wanna marry you, Lucas.&rdquo; Lucas looks up to meet his gaze, he opens his mouth a few times but never says a word. &ldquo;I would marry you right now if you wanted as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-We can get married sometime in the future.&rdquo; Eliott chews his bottom lip, stepping back and starting to walk again, finally arriving at their hotel.</p><p>Lucas is still looking at him, trying to ask for forgiveness without saying and without needing to apologize. Eliott is stupid for even talking about marriage when he left his ex when just the idea of getting engaged to her became a reality.</p><p>&ldquo;Eliott&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Lucas, it was just a stupid idea.&rdquo; He locks the bedroom door after Lucas, taking his new clothes off and leaving in a pile right next to the door, he&rsquo;s exhausted.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I like you. Really like you.&rdquo; Eliott passes by him on the way to the bed, taking his underwear off when he&rsquo;s under the covers, Lucas is still where he was a minute ago, looking like he&rsquo;s about to cry, ashamed. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;m a whole lot of problems and it&rsquo;s so fucked up, no wonder why you wouldn&rsquo;t marry me, I get it, I know I&rsquo;m asking too much. I need to sleep, we&rsquo;ll talk later.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t let Lucas answer him, making it clear that the conversation is over when he covers himself completely with the covers, trying to stay still so Lucas won&rsquo;t bother him.</p><p>The room is silent for a long time, Eliott is trying to keep his breathe slow so he won&rsquo;t start sobbing and call Lucas&rsquo; attention to come see what&rsquo;s going on. The other one finally moves, walking around the room but Eliott doesn&rsquo;t bother looking what he&rsquo;s doing, he closes his eyes, trying to fall asleep for a little. Soon it will all be over and Lucas won&rsquo;t even remember they existed.</p><p>And Eliott will be the one thinking about it while he walks up the aisle to marry the girl he doesn&rsquo;t want. He finally closes his eyes, hoping to be able to fall asleep tonight.</p></p>",
