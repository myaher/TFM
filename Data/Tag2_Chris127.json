The two of you broke up due to you losing your\nfeelings for one another. There had never been the hot and buzzing chemistry in\nbetween you and Chadwick, you simply went from friends to friends with benefits\nand then to a couple. But that was six years ago.</p><p>You had been with Chris for three years and knew that he was the love of\nyour life, the only issue was that you had never told the actor about your relationship\nwith Chadwick.

You\u2019ve barely spoken a word\nsince we came\u201d Chris said with a concerned smile as he feared that his friend\nwasn\u2019t doing well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d Chadwick faked a smile and tried his best to not look at you,\nthe whole situation just felt awkward to him and the last thing he wanted to do\nwas draw everyone\u2019s attention of him. You cleared your throat and slowly took a\nsip of your water.</p><p>\u201cSee, exes still can be cool around each other\u201d Lupita mumbled and\nnodded her head towards you, not knowing that she just had dropped the bomb\nwhile the whole table got quiet. Everyone\u2019s head snapping between you and Chadwick.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d Chris softly asked while looking at you, his heart having\nskipped several beats while he tried his best to stay calm. Chadwick\u2019s eyes\nwidened as he then realized that you had never told Chris about you and him. It\nonly made him more uncomfortable as now his friendship with your boyfriend was\nbeing jeopardized.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk somewhere private?\u201d you asked, hating that you were the center\nof attention. Chris nodded his head and then stood up. You copied his actions before\nthe two of you walked out of the restaurant and back to the parking lot.</p><p>The second you were standing in front of Chris\u2019s car he snapped.</p><p>\u201cSo, you and Chadwick, huh?\u201d he hissed before running his hands through\nhis soft hair, feeling angered and betrayed. You let out soft sigh as you hated\nbeing the reason for your boyfriend\u2019s bad mood.</p><p>\u201cChris, it was years ago\u201d you explained and frowned when the actor let\nout a loud huff while glaring at you. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for three years,\n[Y/N]. How come that you never felt the need to tell me that you dated one of\nmy friends?!\u201d Chris shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d was all you were able to mumble while feeling so ashamed and\nstupid. </p><p>\u201cBut you always held those big <i>honesty\nis the key to a successful relationship</i> speeches to me whenever I was\nstruggling to come completely clean to you, [Y/N]\u201d your boyfriend shook his\nhead. His words hit you hard in the chest as he was telling nothing but the\ntruth. Chris had exposed your hypocrisy and it left a bitter taste in your\nmouth. </p><p>You held those long and big speeches about honesty, loyalty, faithfulness\nand trust and always made him feel bad when he couldn\u2019t confess whatever he was\nlocking up inside him to you. But the joke was on you for keeping a pretty big\nsecret away from him.</p><p>\u201cChris\u201d you whispered speechless and ashamed. Your boyfriend shook his\nhead when you took a step forward to hug him. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, [Y/N]\u2026 I\u2019m so hurt\nand disappointed\u2026.\u201d His words made your heart shatter in your chest as you\nrealized how much you had messed up.</p><p>\u201cIt was never my intention to hurt you\u201d you confessed while swallowing\nthe big lump in your throat, not knowing what to do or say in order to stop\nyour boyfriend from hurting. Chris looked at you and clenched his jaw shut, suddenly\nfeeling like he was looking at a stranger. He furrowed his eyebrows, \u201cWhat else\nare you keeping away from me? Are there other secrets I should know about?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cChris please don\u2019t do this\u201d you begged and took a step closer to him.</p><p>\u201cDo what? Ask for your honesty, [Y/N]?\u201d the way your name rolled harshly\noff his tongue made you bite your lip as you knew that he was <i>mad</i>. \u201cI\u2019m starting to question whether\nyou\u2019ve always been honest with me\u201d Chris mumbled and scratched his neck, not having\nthought that this day would turn out to be a bad one.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to make this up to you?\u201d you begged, your stomach churning\nin discomfort while the shame and guilt still ate you alive.</p><p>\u201cI need a few days to myself\u201d Chris exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m too angry and hurt\nto think straight so instead of doing something I might regret, I\u2019m asking you\nto stay at your friend\u2019s house while I collect my thoughts\u201d.</p><p>You clenched your jaw while feeling your heart painfully clench in your\nchest. \u201cO-Okay\u201d you weakly whispered and watched the actor nod his head. It\nfelt like your world had come crashing down, all because of you.</p><p>While Chris got into his car and quickly started his engine, you\nrealized that you should have confessed your secret from the very beginning. It\nwas manipulative and selfish from you to expect so many things from him while\nnot putting the same amount of effort and energy into the things you kept\npreaching about. </p><p>With an aching heart and teary eyes, you got your phone out of your\npurse and ordered an Uber, wishing that you could go back in time and right\nyour wrongs.</p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3300\" data-orig-height=\"471\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/92d0376dec46d4c0b1d9b79ad8564a4a/tumblr_inline_pn35iu136r1u76kd4_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3300\" data-orig-height=\"471\"/></figure><p><b>Tag list:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-ixtvXWYRjnPY2ci_2H2Qw\">@jamesbarnesappreciationsociety</a> \u00a0l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQCv_74CjwaS_PEJtleKI2w\">@pleasantdreamqueen</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQiukMVK06i8gIuZSqag8mA\">@disneymarina</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNB1xtSDi3hrnJb7JSXSqjw\">@koizorahana</a> l l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5kibQ7TNYx1stzpzh32BMg\">@itik-angsa</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzsOy9niPmjfbhYBqyd6a0A\">@sparklemichele</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmWqMeYCqqMUafaMHnY8dXw\">@melaninmarvel</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfx0H27xwRpt5M_Ep0dFZLw\">@amethyst09</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJxr6NB8iL5fXWCB-cS1LfQ\">@the-force-of-imagines</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg3swgy8PaF_CfpMMhG4ieQ\">@bossyboyd03</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk3jCyvsf1lt6d99fG6cH6A\">@enigmaticaphrodite</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwF_faTuWcK9bOxjdhVr6sw\">@pebblesz892</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZdtIjIxEP6UZvjeYFzalzg\">@stars8melanin</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH7xZfPLDjciBP2SWY0sT6A\">@brittyevans</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYgWr4jFi0fiJTuUKxtqzyw\">@toc1985</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7P3-Sw9RWpGbn5Hx4MI5Q\">@janeyboo</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbOe8MT7EHcTjkfLSvti90Q\">@earthtocynthia</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@lafayettes-baguettes-1</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ-__xYtl9MJjmKJU87F0ag\">@winters-beauty</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muI5pmOUaX6wvmS3rzWyaFg\">@cannonindeez</a> \u00a0l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW3rG8OGU5z0bF7hpc7GGtw\">@ilovefanfic86</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRFGeUKdsFmQbN20Im6B6wA\">@foureyedsiopao</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzpa6VC140Rh0xuV3KKzQfw\">@adorablespecialsnowflakes</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAbNjFuFx4LjGdpSDYiuvDg\">@brittanyovens</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMPhxGtiyvS6lRzoCLKblA\">@jazmynejack</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg1Cop7_uIHrZgAe6F08DCg\">@oliviajmarvel</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE075uYL8GhDerMZHu47cCg\">@thebookwormslytherin</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkT23YitSkT0OnrVoJy-tzw\">@theunsweetenedtruth</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFEAzWXUrcNrMxyFoephgw\">@talannalew</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m28vjCOlX587TUhd2Aim0qA\">@littlexmissxfandomxlover</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqOGfTW0AeSA1n8vLZ7u_Lw\">@amethyst-dreams-and-candy-canes</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRECilFLSOv3BsRCElrGyA\">@dedebebe13</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS-aQBYqOd3zetPMpAAC5pA\">@challaxkillmonger</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkwo5DwDq-3uHkvig2KjGDQ\">@crimsonash330</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcJYqpLTihsHWwFk501mJwA\">@booklover2929</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx1AA7Td8Po7vnEjirLLZog\">@aranelgrey</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB0YQZZqvad5zaWBRzLWiLA\">@panda-duuu</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msM0ovIDtcyyW_zok4fAuhg\">@killmonsgyal</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCNbfAm2afBUpNhZjTec9sQ\">@lokislilcaribbeanprincess</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9nHaXHEK2rAR_IE_wt-3Yg\">@titty-teetee</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_P1wub5l9MWmCc3Rlzq3kg\">@honey-anon</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS-aQBYqOd3zetPMpAAC5pA\">@queenxchallaxkillamonger</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7nNck6KdgcoI_KSEF6tZqQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7nNck6KdgcoI_KSEF6tZqQ\">@hp-hogwartsexpress</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwCt1o5g16m2A5W_iL_YP5A\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwCt1o5g16m2A5W_iL_YP5A\">@malindacath</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSIEa6ytnOYsd8qADIe6Zbw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSIEa6ytnOYsd8qADIe6Zbw\">@supernaturaltrashy</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6FR1aCU4FFLqxdDGw_-Ipw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6FR1aCU4FFLqxdDGw_-Ipw\">@letsdisneythings</a>\u00a0l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msALnBBXoCAuJt4nJ6qInUw\">@patron-saintof-sluts</a>\u00a0<br/></p><h2><b>-Emmanuelle \ud83d\udc8b\u2764\ufe0f</b></h2>",

Everyone\u2019s head snapping between you and Chadwick.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d Chris softly asked while looking at you, his heart having\nskipped several beats while he tried his best to stay calm. Chadwick\u2019s eyes\nwidened as he then realized that you had never told Chris about you and him.

Your boyfriend let out an amused chuckle while copying your actions and\nlocking the car before walking over to you and taking your hand in his.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The two of you shared a quick kiss before walking towards the restaurant,\nyour heart pounded in your chest while you tried to look calm and collective.\nYou stifled a squeal when you squinted your eyes and saw the cast sitting far\nin the back of the restaurant, everybody laughing and smiling. </p><p>Chris led you to them with a proud smile on his face as he had been\ntalking about you nonstop. Everybody was so excited to finally meet the woman\nwho had Chris Evans head over heels in love. Ever since he had gotten together\nwith you, it was like he had evolved into the best version of himself. He\nrealized that the things he used to worry about weren\u2019t as serious as they\nseemed, you helped him see the true beauty in love and life and he couldn\u2019t be\nmore grateful for that.</p><p>You shot the actor a quick smile and squeezed his hand before letting go\nof it as you had reached the table and Scarlett being the first person to\nwarmly greet you with a hug and kisses on the cheeks. \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s so nice\nto finally meet you!\u201d the actress happily addressed while the rest of the cast was grinning\nand wiggled their eyebrows at Chris as it was so obvious that he had a\nbeautiful big and black goddess as his girlfriend.</p><p>While you took your turn in greeting and hugging the whole cast, your heart dropped to the pit of your stomach when you faced Chadwick, your\nex-boyfriend of two years. The two of you broke up due to you losing your\nfeelings for one another. There had never been the hot and buzzing chemistry in\nbetween you and Chadwick, you simply went from friends to friends with benefits\nand then to a couple. But that was six years ago.</p><p>You had been with Chris for three years and knew that he was the love of\nyour life, the only issue was that you had never told the actor about your relationship\nwith Chadwick. A part of you knew that it wasn\u2019t good to keep the tiny secret\naway from your boyfriend, but the other part of you always panicked when you\neven thought about confessing it to Chris. </p><p>\u201cHey, long time no see\u201d Chadwick gave you a polite smile before sitting\nback at the table next to Lupita and Danai. You faked a smile before you took a\nseat, feeling your stomach churn in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you and Chris been dating?\u201d RDJ asked while sipping\non his lemonade, so happy that his good friend had found himself a good woman. \u201cThree\nyears\u201d you smiled and chuckled when the rest of the cast broke out in a loud \u201caww!\u201d,\nmaking the other people in the restaurant shoot you weird glances.</p><p>Chris had a proud smile on his face and then ordered your meals, already\nknowing what you got when eating outside. Everybody then erupted in different conversations,\nBenedict and Tom (Hiddleston) asked if you had ever been to England and happily\nrecommended cities and restaurant you\u2019d have to check out if you\u2019d ever decide\nto visit the country.</p><p>Elizabeth quickly noticed Chadwick\u2019s oddly quiet and calm demeanor and\nasked him if he was doing okay. \u201cAre you sure? You\u2019ve barely spoken a word\nsince we came\u201d Chris said with a concerned smile as he feared that his friend\nwasn\u2019t doing well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d Chadwick faked a smile and tried his best to not look at you,\nthe whole situation just felt awkward to him and the last thing he wanted to do\nwas draw everyone\u2019s attention of him. You cleared your throat and slowly took a\nsip of your water.</p><p>\u201cSee, exes still can be cool around each other\u201d Lupita mumbled and\nnodded her head towards you, not knowing that she just had dropped the bomb\nwhile the whole table got quiet. Everyone\u2019s head snapping between you and Chadwick.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d Chris softly asked while looking at you, his heart having\nskipped several beats while he tried his best to stay calm. Chadwick\u2019s eyes\nwidened as he then realized that you had never told Chris about you and him. It\nonly made him more uncomfortable as now his friendship with your boyfriend was\nbeing jeopardized.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk somewhere private?\u201d you asked, hating that you were the center\nof attention. Chris nodded his head and then stood up. You copied his actions before\nthe two of you walked out of the restaurant and back to the parking lot.</p><p>The second you were standing in front of Chris\u2019s car he snapped.</p><p>\u201cSo, you and Chadwick, huh?\u201d he hissed before running his hands through\nhis soft hair, feeling angered and betrayed. You let out soft sigh as you hated\nbeing the reason for your boyfriend\u2019s bad mood.</p><p>\u201cChris, it was years ago\u201d you explained and frowned when the actor let\nout a loud huff while glaring at you. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for three years,\n[Y/N]. How come that you never felt the need to tell me that you dated one of\nmy friends?!\u201d Chris shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d was all you were able to mumble while feeling so ashamed and\nstupid. </p><p>\u201cBut you always held those big <i>honesty\nis the key to a successful relationship</i> speeches to me whenever I was\nstruggling to come completely clean to you, [Y/N]\u201d your boyfriend shook his\nhead. His words hit you hard in the chest as he was telling nothing but the\ntruth. Chris had exposed your hypocrisy and it left a bitter taste in your\nmouth. </p><p>You held those long and big speeches about honesty, loyalty, faithfulness\nand trust and always made him feel bad when he couldn\u2019t confess whatever he was\nlocking up inside him to you. But the joke was on you for keeping a pretty big\nsecret away from him.</p><p>\u201cChris\u201d you whispered speechless and ashamed. Your boyfriend shook his\nhead when you took a step forward to hug him. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, [Y/N]\u2026 I\u2019m so hurt\nand disappointed\u2026.\u201d His words made your heart shatter in your chest as you\nrealized how much you had messed up.</p><p>\u201cIt was never my intention to hurt you\u201d you confessed while swallowing\nthe big lump in your throat, not knowing what to do or say in order to stop\nyour boyfriend from hurting.

Your boyfriend let out an amused chuckle while copying your actions and\nlocking the car before walking over to you and taking your hand in his.</p><p>The two of you shared a quick kiss before walking towards the restaurant,\nyour heart pounded in your chest while you tried to look calm and collective.\nYou stifled a squeal when you squinted your eyes and saw the cast sitting far\nin the back of the restaurant, everybody laughing and smiling. </p><p>Chris led you to them with a proud smile on his face as he had been\ntalking about you nonstop. Everybody was so excited to finally meet the woman\nwho had Chris Evans head over heels in love. Ever since he had gotten together\nwith you, it was like he had evolved into the best version of himself. He\nrealized that the things he used to worry about weren&rsquo;t as serious as they\nseemed, you helped him see the true beauty in love and life and he couldn&rsquo;t be\nmore grateful for that.</p><p>You shot the actor a quick smile and squeezed his hand before letting go\nof it as you had reached the table and Scarlett being the first person to\nwarmly greet you with a hug and kisses on the cheeks. &ldquo;Oh my god, it&rsquo;s so nice\nto finally meet you!&rdquo; the actress happily addressed while the rest of the cast was grinning\nand wiggled their eyebrows at Chris as it was so obvious that he had a\nbeautiful big and black goddess as his girlfriend.</p><p>While you took your turn in greeting and hugging the whole cast, your heart dropped to the pit of your stomach when you faced Chadwick, your\nex-boyfriend of two years. The two of you broke up due to you losing your\nfeelings for one another. There had never been the hot and buzzing chemistry in\nbetween you and Chadwick, you simply went from friends to friends with benefits\nand then to a couple. But that was six years ago.</p><p>You had been with Chris for three years and knew that he was the love of\nyour life, the only issue was that you had never told the actor about your relationship\nwith Chadwick. A part of you knew that it wasn&rsquo;t good to keep the tiny secret\naway from your boyfriend, but the other part of you always panicked when you\neven thought about confessing it to Chris. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, long time no see&rdquo; Chadwick gave you a polite smile before sitting\nback at the table next to Lupita and Danai. You faked a smile before you took a\nseat, feeling your stomach churn in discomfort.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how long have you and Chris been dating?&rdquo; RDJ asked while sipping\non his lemonade, so happy that his good friend had found himself a good woman. &ldquo;Three\nyears&rdquo; you smiled and chuckled when the rest of the cast broke out in a loud &ldquo;aww!&rdquo;,\nmaking the other people in the restaurant shoot you weird glances.</p><p>Chris had a proud smile on his face and then ordered your meals, already\nknowing what you got when eating outside. Everybody then erupted in different conversations,\nBenedict and Tom (Hiddleston) asked if you had ever been to England and happily\nrecommended cities and restaurant you&rsquo;d have to check out if you&rsquo;d ever decide\nto visit the country.</p><p>Elizabeth quickly noticed Chadwick&rsquo;s oddly quiet and calm demeanor and\nasked him if he was doing okay. &ldquo;Are you sure? You&rsquo;ve barely spoken a word\nsince we came&rdquo; Chris said with a concerned smile as he feared that his friend\nwasn&rsquo;t doing well.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; Chadwick faked a smile and tried his best to not look at you,\nthe whole situation just felt awkward to him and the last thing he wanted to do\nwas draw everyone&rsquo;s attention of him. You cleared your throat and slowly took a\nsip of your water.</p><p>&ldquo;See, exes still can be cool around each other&rdquo; Lupita mumbled and\nnodded her head towards you, not knowing that she just had dropped the bomb\nwhile the whole table got quiet. Everyone&rsquo;s head snapping between you and Chadwick.</p><p>&ldquo;W-What?&rdquo; Chris softly asked while looking at you, his heart having\nskipped several beats while he tried his best to stay calm. Chadwick&rsquo;s eyes\nwidened as he then realized that you had never told Chris about you and him. It\nonly made him more uncomfortable as now his friendship with your boyfriend was\nbeing jeopardized.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we talk somewhere private?&rdquo; you asked, hating that you were the center\nof attention. Chris nodded his head and then stood up. You copied his actions before\nthe two of you walked out of the restaurant and back to the parking lot.</p><p>The second you were standing in front of Chris&rsquo;s car he snapped.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you and Chadwick, huh?&rdquo; he hissed before running his hands through\nhis soft hair, feeling angered and betrayed. You let out soft sigh as you hated\nbeing the reason for your boyfriend&rsquo;s bad mood.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, it was years ago&rdquo; you explained and frowned when the actor let\nout a loud huff while glaring at you. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been together for three years,\n[Y/N]. How come that you never felt the need to tell me that you dated one of\nmy friends?!&rdquo; Chris shook his head in disappointment.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&hellip;&rdquo; was all you were able to mumble while feeling so ashamed and\nstupid. </p><p>&ldquo;But you always held those big <i>honesty\nis the key to a successful relationship</i> speeches to me whenever I was\nstruggling to come completely clean to you, [Y/N]&rdquo; your boyfriend shook his\nhead. His words hit you hard in the chest as he was telling nothing but the\ntruth. Chris had exposed your hypocrisy and it left a bitter taste in your\nmouth. </p><p>You held those long and big speeches about honesty, loyalty, faithfulness\nand trust and always made him feel bad when he couldn&rsquo;t confess whatever he was\nlocking up inside him to you. But the joke was on you for keeping a pretty big\nsecret away from him.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris&rdquo; you whispered speechless and ashamed. Your boyfriend shook his\nhead when you took a step forward to hug him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me, [Y/N]&hellip; I&rsquo;m so hurt\nand disappointed&hellip;.&rdquo; His words made your heart shatter in your chest as you\nrealized how much you had messed up.</p><p>&ldquo;It was never my intention to hurt you&rdquo; you confessed while swallowing\nthe big lump in your throat, not knowing what to do or say in order to stop\nyour boyfriend from hurting. Chris looked at you and clenched his jaw shut, suddenly\nfeeling like he was looking at a stranger. He furrowed his eyebrows, &ldquo;What else\nare you keeping away from me? Are there other secrets I should know about?&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris please don&rsquo;t do this&rdquo; you begged and took a step closer to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do what? Ask for your honesty, [Y/N]?&rdquo; the way your name rolled harshly\noff his tongue made you bite your lip as you knew that he was <i>mad</i>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to question whether\nyou&rsquo;ve always been honest with me&rdquo; Chris mumbled and scratched his neck, not having\nthought that this day would turn out to be a bad one.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I do to make this up to you?&rdquo; you begged, your stomach churning\nin discomfort while the shame and guilt still ate you alive.</p><p>&ldquo;I need a few days to myself&rdquo; Chris exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too angry and hurt\nto think straight so instead of doing something I might regret, I&rsquo;m asking you\nto stay at your friend&rsquo;s house while I collect my thoughts&rdquo;.</p><p>You clenched your jaw while feeling your heart painfully clench in your\nchest. &ldquo;O-Okay&rdquo; you weakly whispered and watched the actor nod his head.

This is my husband Nathan.\u201d The men also shake hands while Jessie and Harper hug.</p><p>It took about 20 minutes for them to start talking about football. Nathan started the topic, so she could not blame Chris. The dinner was nice and everyone had a great time. In the end, Chris walked with them to their hotel.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you lovebirds to say goodbye. Nice to meet you, man! See you tomorrow, right?\u201d Nathan says holding a sleeping Violet against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll meet you guys at the skiing track. It was great to meet you too, you have a beautiful family\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Have a good night, Chris.

What reminds me I better have a talk to my publicist before she sees us in a magazine and bites my ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt Harpiiiie!&rdquo; the cutest little redhead yells before hugging her legs. Harper crouches to talk with the kid. &ldquo;Hey love, how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great! I&rsquo;m the best skater of the family! Dad said it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, of your family I&rsquo;m sure you are&hellip;but you still have to beat me to be the best of all the Followill&rsquo;s. Are you up to a competition tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! That&rsquo;s going to be awesome!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will. Violet, this is Chris.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Violet, how are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you my auntie&rsquo;s boyfriend now?&rdquo;</p><p>The adults smile awkwardly over the girl&rsquo;s sincerity and he nods. &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. Ok.&rdquo; she keeps looking at him with a sweet smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You must be Jessie.&rdquo; He says stretching his hands to shake hers. &ldquo;Yes. Nice to meet you. This is my husband Nathan.&rdquo; The men also shake hands while Jessie and Harper hug.</p><p>It took about 20 minutes for them to start talking about football. Nathan started the topic, so she could not blame Chris. The dinner was nice and everyone had a great time. In the end, Chris walked with them to their hotel.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave you lovebirds to say goodbye. Nice to meet you, man! See you tomorrow, right?&rdquo; Nathan says holding a sleeping Violet against his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll meet you guys at the skiing track. It was great to meet you too, you have a beautiful family&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. Have a good night, Chris. See you tomorrow.&rdquo; Jessie gives him a kiss and goes inside with her husband and daughter. Harper hugs him and talks in his ear. &ldquo;Thank you, it was a great night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was really good. I like them. I like to see you with them&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I different?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just more comfortable I guess.&rdquo; He kisses her quickly and hugs her again. &ldquo;Call me before you go to sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you go out with the guys tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess..but nothing big, maybe just have drinks at the hotel&hellip;call me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. Good night, sugar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night, babe&rdquo;</p><p>They part ways and she goes straight to her room, but as soon as she closes the door, Jessie knocks &ldquo;Hey, open up!&rdquo; she does and her friend enters with a big smile. &ldquo;Wow! You two look so good together, Har!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a great guy&hellip;&rdquo; she says throwing herself at the bed. &ldquo;And the sex&hellip;my god, he&rsquo;s amazing&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, you deserve amazing! So, it&rsquo;s serious&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t want to comment but he did say &lsquo;girlfriend&rsquo; at one point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. He wants to be my boyfriend&hellip;&rdquo; she smiles dreamily and hugs a pillow.</p><p>&ldquo;I am so happy for you! After everything&hellip;you deserve this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go to New York in January&hellip;he has some work there and wants me to stay with him&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you do have some free time, and it&rsquo;ll be good for you to leave Nashville for a bit, you know? I know you keep saying it&rsquo;s past but Caleb does have an impact on you and I&rsquo;m afraid this is not something that will ever go away..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want him to be happy and I know he wants the same for me&hellip;.it&rsquo;s just hard sometimes; I feel like we&rsquo;ll always have this sadness about things not working between us, you know? I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll ever learn how to deal with it. But it&rsquo;s not like we want to try anything at all, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get it, Har&hellip;I just feel like Lily wants to bring you to all this baby related things and I don&rsquo;t think she does it on purpose, but I would rather see you doing your own things. Anyway&hellip;let&rsquo;s focus on Chris! What about his house? His friends?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my, don&rsquo;t get me started on his friends!&rdquo; she sits, facing Jessie &ldquo;Should we have something to drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, come, let&rsquo;s go to my room, Nathan has a wine bottle and it&rsquo;s going to spare me the trouble of repeating it all to him&rdquo; Jessie stands from the bed and takes Harper hands, pulling her out of the bed. In Jessie&rsquo;s room, they all got comfy at the bed, Nathan and Jessie leaning against the headboard and Harper resting between them on her stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. He has this friend, Adam, who&rsquo;s an actor also&hellip;and is a fucker. He waits for Chris to leave so we can say how I&rsquo;m his type and would like him better&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to cause drama but fuck, I hate him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should tell him.&rdquo; Nathan says taking a sip of his wine.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know&hellip;I will. Well, if he acts like that again I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vV9Tri3x7cdvHjM9IL-5w\">@mackevanstanfan80</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a></p>",

This is just some good ol\u2019 fashioned Evanstan smut that I felt like writing today \ud83d\ude02 hope you guys like it sjjsjsjs</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014</p><p><br/></p><p>It was late as hell and Sebastian was drunk, drunk enough to make some extremely questionable decisions and not give a single fuck as to whether he\u2019d regret it in the morning. It explained why he was still in Chris\u2019 hotel room long after the others had left, still playing Truth or Dare with Chris way after all the others had bowed out, sitting next to him on a small leather couch with their knees pressed casually together. He might die before the night was over but he really couldn\u2019t think of a better way to go. </p><p><!-- more --></p><p>The game had devolved into a series of have you ever\u2019s, dares not really coming into the equation anymore, and that was fine. Sebastian was having fun getting to know Chris better and Chris seemed to be doing the same, and Sebastian got comfortable enough to ask him things he\u2019d never have the courage to ask him sober. </p><p><br/></p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it, really - sitting there so close to Chris, watching him throw his head back and laugh, watching his throat work as he drank on his beer, the way that he licked his lips and eyes lit up when he\u2019d tell an outrageous story from back in Boston&hellip;. <i>God</i> Sebastian was smitten. He was already smitten, of course, but <i>this</i>&hellip; this made it so much worse. </p><p><br/></p><p>And Chris, he was such a flirt. It came to him as naturally as breathing, and while Sebastian was used to it, he just didn\u2019t know if Chris really meant it or if he just did it to do it. He wanted Chris to mean it, all those teasing little touches and playful looks he\u2019d shoot Sebastian, but he only ever seemed to date women and Sebastian just needed to finally <i>know</i>. </p><p><br/></p><p>And that was why, when it was Sebastian\u2019s turn again, he finally blurted out the question he\u2019d been wanting to ask Chris for months. Years even, maybe. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou ever kiss a guy?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris shook his head as he swallowed from his beer bottle, setting it between his legs. \u201cNope. Never.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cReally? Never?\u201d Sebastian asked, his hopes deflating a little. Surely if Chris wanted to experiment with a man, he\u2019d have done so by now. \u201cNot even&hellip; never?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris chuckled and shook his head again. \u201cNah. You?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know I have.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh, right, the - your roles,\u201d Chris nodded, gesturing vaguely with his hand. \u201cBut I mean, y\u2019know - a real kiss.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian blushed a little, looking down at his own beer nestled in his hands in his lap. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve, uh&hellip; yeah.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian nodded, daring to peek at Chris, knowing he looked much shyer about it than he really was. \u201cYeah. A lot.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Chris paused, cocking his head curiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me,\u201d Sebastian grinned with a playfully mysterious look, and they both laughed at that. It didn\u2019t stop Sebastian\u2019s heart from racing, the current subject matter more than enough to make him fight breaking into a sweat. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve&hellip;\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s my turn to ask a question,\u201d Sebastian protested. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou can just double up next time,\u201d Chris waved him off. \u201cSo&hellip; you&hellip;\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian raised a brow. \u201cI\u2019ve&hellip;?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSlept with men,\u201d Chris said, that curious glint still in his pretty blue eyes. </p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian blushed and wanted to scream a little, but he kept it all hidden inside. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris eyed him silently, something in his expression that Sebastian couldn\u2019t quite place. It made him even more nervous, a thrill running through his veins as he felt a little exposed, like Chris was examining him for&hellip; something. </p><p><br/></p><p>Chris took another drink without taking his eyes off of Sebastian. Sebastian licked his lips and - <i>oh God</i>, Chris watched him do it and <i>fuck</i> - </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Sebastian said a bit shakily, too shakily. \u201cYou ever thought about it?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He didn\u2019t need to specify what it was for Chris to get it. He blinked once, then twice, then looked away as he shrugged one massive shoulder and muttered, \u201cI mean&hellip; everybody has, right?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cBut I mean really thought about it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes snapped to Seb\u2019s, the air between them growing more tense with each second that passed. \u201cFew times.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s stomach flipped. He had another question before it was Chris\u2019 turn again, so he asked before he could think better of it, \u201cWould you ever try it?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Chris answered surprisingly quickly. \u201cWith the right person.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian was already getting hard in his jeans. Just talking about this with Chris and seeing the look on his face, the open curiosity, the hint of something else&hellip; </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow do you&hellip; what do you&hellip;.\u201d Chris faltered for a moment, unsure of how to ask his next question. Finally he just decided out with it. \u201cYou top or bottom?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s heart skipped a few beats and he knew his face was on fire. \u201cBoth. But I like bottoming the most.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris\u2019 brows inches up fractionally and Seb could have sworn he heard him mutter a low <i>fuck</i> under his breath. Then he looked back at Sebastian and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s it feel like?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian had to look away to answer, briefly closing his eyes before taking a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s&hellip; it\u2019s <i>really</i> fucking good. It can be overwhelming. You feel so full and you just&hellip; you feel things you didn\u2019t think were even possible. It\u2019s addicting.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>It took awhile before Sebastian could bring himself to meet Chris\u2019 gaze again. When he did he found Chris staring at him, expression maddeningly unreadable. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Chris murmured. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you so curious about me?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris smirked a little bit, the bastard. \u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian wanted to groan and bang his head into the nearest hard surface, but instead he sighed and gestured for Chris to go next. He never could have prepared himself for what came next. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIf I asked you to come here&hellip; and let me try something&hellip; would you?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s eyes flew to Chris\u2019 in shock, finding the dark and slightly hungry look on his face and wondering if he\u2019d fallen asleep and this was all a drunken dream. But even if it was, he was sure as hell gonna take advantage of it. \u201cI&hellip; <i>yeah</i>, fuck.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris then set his beer aside and adjusted a little where he sat, widening his legs a little and giving a tiny, somehow arousing jerk of his head. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian went to him so fast he would later remember nothing about it, seemingly teleporting himself on to Chris\u2019 lap before he could so much as draw a breath. He straddled those wonderfully muscular thighs and watched as Chris looked him over, his hands cautiously coming to rest on Sebastian\u2019s denim-clad hips. Sebastian wasn\u2019t sure what to do with his hands so he held on to the back of the couch with one hand and let the other hang at his sides. </p><p><br/></p><p>Neither of them spoke at first, Chris slowly letting his hands drift up Sebastian\u2019s sides. \u201cFuck,\u201d Chris muttered appreciatively as he dragged his eyes up Seb\u2019s torso, watching his own hands move up. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so fuckin\u2019 big.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian shuddered, fairly sure he could come just from Chris\u2019 innocent touches and his words. \u201cYeah, trying&hellip; tryin\u2019 to keep up with you,\u201d he replied breathlessly. </p><p><br/></p><p>Chris grinned up at him briefly before slowly dragging Sebastian\u2019s shirt up, exposing his hard-earned abs. He kept moving the fabric up, up, up until it had nowhere to go but off, and suddenly Sebastian found himself shirtless in Chris\u2019 lap. </p><p><br/></p><p>Chris leaned back an inch or two to fully take him in, getting braver with his hands as he placed them on Sebastian\u2019s stomach and let them feel him, slowly moving upwards. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking gorgeous, Seb. Always thought so.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian made some kind of noise in his throat like the wind had been knocked out of him, his hand on the couch slipping down to grip Chris\u2019 shoulder. Chris didn\u2019t seem to mind, though he was preoccupied with sliding his palms over Sebastian\u2019s impressive pecs. \u201c<i>Chris</i> -\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>Then those hands were on Seb\u2019s shoulders, fingers gently and briefly touching the ends of his long hair before trailing down his broad back. Sebastian\u2019s skin erupted into flame everywhere Chris touched him, every point of contact going straight to his cock and making him feel like he might burst at any moment. He was sure that he\u2019d never been so turned on, and they hadn\u2019t even kissed. </p><p><br/></p><p>Chris\u2019 hands ended up on Sebastian\u2019s ass, gripping it through his jeans, and the little gasp that left Sebastian\u2019s lips made Chris grin and lean his head forward. Sebastian felt hot breath on his chest and his entire body tensed, cock throbbing in his jeans as Chris squeezed, lips just barely brushing his skin&hellip;</p><p><br/></p><p>Then Chris slid his hands <i>into</i> Sebastian\u2019s jeans, gripping his ass hard and pulling him closer, rocking them together through their jeans, and Sebastian moaned because it felt so good and <i>Chris was hard too</i>, but nothing could have prepared him for the sudden flick of a hot tongue on a sensitive nipple. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh my God, <i>Chris</i>,\u201d Sebastian whined, free hand moving to the back of Chris\u2019 head on instinct, hips moving on their own accord to grind down on Chris\u2019 lap. Chris replied by wrapping his lips around his nipple and sucking and Sebastian couldn\u2019t take it, his entire body feeling like a live wire. </p><p><br/></p><p>Chris pulled away to look up into Sebastian\u2019s already-wrecked face, Chris\u2019 pupils dilated and cheeks flushed and yeah, <i>God</i> he was into this, too. \u201cYou\u2019re so hard, Seb&hellip;\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Sebastian retorted, voice low and broken-sounding as he rocked in Chris\u2019 lap, the friction as delicious as it was frustrating. Chris dug his fingers in hard as a reply, and Sebastian moaned and hoped there\u2019d be bruises later. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re noisy,\u201d Chris noted with delight, pulling one hand free only to press it against the front of Sebastian\u2019s jeans, gripping him there experimentally. Sebastian stopped rocking and let another breathless sound leave his throat. \u201cDamn. Barely touching you and you\u2019re this loud&hellip;\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian simply whimpered as Chris started rubbing him, letting his head drop forward and almost press against Chris\u2019 forehead. \u201cChris&hellip; <i>God</i>, Chris -\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris\u2019 voice was deep and soothing, like something out of Sebastian\u2019s fantasies. \u201cYeah, Seb. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>He wanted so many fucking things, none of which were going to happen right now because - \u201cM\u2019gonna come,\u201d he whispered, trying to hold back but it just wasn\u2019t gonna happen, not when he\u2019d been on the edge since the first time Chris\u2019 hands landed on him. \u201cFuck, Chris, I\u2019m -\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cJust from this?\u201d Chris grinned, clearly enjoying his effect upon his friend. \u201cThis all it takes, baby?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian pressed harder into his hand and gripped Chris\u2019 hair hard, mouth falling open and body all but singing at being called <i>baby</i> by this man. He chanted Chris\u2019 name in whispers and Chris tightened his hand and moved it harder, head ducking down to lick across his nipples again and that was it, Sebastian was gone and coming hard in his pants, hard enough to nearly ascend to another plane of existence. </p><p><br/></p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt anything so intense. When he was recovered enough to remember where he was, his face was buried in Chris\u2019 neck and Chris was running soothing fingers up and down Sebastian\u2019s back. Sebastian slowly raised his head, meeting Chris\u2019 still-hungry gaze and expecting to wake up from this dream any second. </p><p><br/></p><p>But instead of waking up, Chris tilted Sebastian\u2019s chin up with a single long finger and leaned in to kiss him. It was soft and unexpected and Sebastian melted, exhaling shakily when Chris pulled away and their eyes met again. </p><p><br/></p><p>Chris licked his lips, as if tasting Sebastian on them. \u201cI think I like this.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian didn\u2019t give himself any time to smile or give some kind of witty reply. Instead he kissed Chris like his life depended on it, having no idea if he\u2019d ever get the chance to do this again and wanting to make the most of it while he could. And when Chris responded with a groan and the plunge of his tongue in Sebastian\u2019s mouth, Seb knew he\u2019d picked the right course of action. </p><p><br/></p><p>They kissed and kissed and kissed, Sebastian not caring one bit about the mess in his pants as he memorized the feel of Chris\u2019s lips on his, tongues tangling together and hands drifting all over the place. He wished that it could last forever, more than happy to while away eternity kissing the hell out of Chris Evans in his lap, but he knew that it couldn\u2019t and anyway Chris was still rock hard beneath him. And he knew just how he wanted to take him apart. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d Sebastian huffed against Chris\u2019 lips, tugging impatiently at his shirt. They broke apart and Chris all but tore off his shirt, dropping it behind the couch and watching as Sebastian took him in. </p><p><br/></p><p>He\u2019d seen Chris shirtless before plenty of times, of course. The whole world had. But  he\u2019d never seen him shirtless like this, up close and able to feel that perfect skin beneath his fingertips. He dragged his fingers all over him, through his chest hair and over his nipples, down his ribs and to his abs, and then he ducked down and let his mouth follow. He was gonna taste every inch of Chris that he could, and Chris was happy to let him.</p><p><br/></p><p>Chris ran his fingers through Seb\u2019s hair as he made his way down, holding it back so that he could watch Sebastian unimpeded by a curtain of hair over his face. Chris didn\u2019t hold back his own sounds as Sebastian tasted him all over, those pouty lips becoming acquainted with Chris\u2019 body and making him ache in his jeans, the whole thing something he\u2019d never known that he\u2019d needed until now. But he had no idea what he was in for, not really. </p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian wasted no time in getting Chris\u2019 jeans undone once he reached them, impatient in getting them and Chris\u2019 underwear down far enough to free the cock he\u2019d spent longer than he\u2019d ever admit fantasizing about. Turned out that the real thing was even better, large and so damn hard and like velvet in his hand, leaking and throbbing and the fact that Sebastian was the reason for it&hellip; <i>God</i> he might just be ruined for anyone else after this. </p><p><br/></p><p>On his knees between Chris\u2019 legs, Sebastian stroked him slow and firm, watching as more pre-come leaked out, and when he leaned in to lick it off Chris made a sound that Sebastian would never forget. Sebastian peeked up at him, maintaining eye contact as he continued to stroke him and lick him, closing his eyes only when he finally wrapped his lips around the tip and moaned like it was the best thing he\u2019d ever tasted. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cFuck, Seb,\u201d Chris gasped, fingers tightening in Sebastian\u2019s hair as he swallowed him down. Chris watched every bit of it, mouth open and brows furrowed and a blush visible on his cheeks and chest as Sebastian showed off just how good he was at this. And he really was - he took pride in how good he was with his mouth, how he could bring a man to his knees like this and make even the quietest of them beg for more. But he wasn\u2019t gonna make Chris beg. All he wanted was to hear his name on Chris\u2019 lips as he came in his mouth - he\u2019d wanted that for so long. </p><p><br/></p><p>He took his time getting there, however, not going too slow nor too fast, wanting this to be perfect for Chris. He looked up as he worked, watching the muscles in Chris\u2019 torso flex and relax, tightening every time Sebastian did something with his tongue that Chris really liked. Sebastian couldn\u2019t help but reach up to touch him with his free hand, running it everywhere he could reach, sometimes playing with a nipple and watching Chris gasp with all the warring sensations. </p><p><br/></p><p>But it wasn\u2019t long before Chris reached the end of his rope, needing more and not being afraid to demand it. \u201cC\u2019mon Seb, faster, harder, baby. You feel so fuckin\u2019 good, I\u2019ve <i>gotta</i> have more, please&hellip;\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian couldn\u2019t have denied him even if he\u2019d wanted to. He grabbed Chris\u2019 hand and placed it back in his hair, and Chris held on tight as Sebastian dove back in and focused on giving Chris everything he wanted. He sucked him off like it was his mission in life, like he wanted nothing more than to see Chris lose it and spill in his mouth, and if that was the truth, well&hellip; nobody could blame him. </p><p><br/></p><p>It was only minutes then when he felt Chris tensing, fingers and abs tightening and breaths coming hard, sweet little sounds leaving his lips getting more and more desperate. Sebastian took him all the way down, deep throating him and showing no mercy, giving him everything he wanted and then some. His only warning was a rush of deep, breathy <i>Seb, Seb, God baby</i> and then Chris was coming and coming and Sebastian was happy to utterly drown in him. </p><p><br/></p><p>He swallowed every drop and was careful to clean Chris up the best that he could, tucking him back into his pants as Chris laid boneless and panting on the couch. Sebastian grinned at the debauched sight that he made, taking a mental picture before climbing up back into Chris\u2019 lap and kissing the corner of his mouth softly. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat fuckin\u2019 mouth of yours,\u201d Chris groaned, eyes still closed but his arms wrapping loosely around his friend and maybe lover. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian grinned with pride and nuzzled his jaw. \u201cGlad you liked it.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI loved it,\u201d Chris replied, opening his eyes and meeting Sebastian\u2019s gaze. \u201cI loved it all.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Sebastian murmured, blushing a little. </p><p><br/></p><p>They stayed there like that, still basking in the afterglow and the unexpected bliss of it all, until Chris sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty late.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>Sebastian stiffened, thinking that Chris was going to gently show him the door now. \u201cYeah, yeah. I should g-\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cStay over?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>They spoke the words at the same time, then smiled and chuckled together as Sebastian exhaled with relief. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he replied, leaning in and brushing a kiss across Chris\u2019 lips. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Chris murmured with a faint grin, \u201cbecause I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m done with you yet.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><i>God</i> Sebastian hoped he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAidATIEpHEyeBI44BIGmZg\">@captainrogerrsbeard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7eywmAnCn-B194usnbb0g\">@take-me-tom-hiddleston</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF4C3vOwxZjEWzQJ3tQMjCw\">@supersmuttyqueernerd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msRbKovV7RdgRgAhW2eVEOA\">@freshwoods</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJFoEDHp53CswU_ZHWCm1qA\">@ravensonata</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJxgalB5nL0TlWqrSNHemqA\">@lisamott9</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwhx6YCBRC0o8pVLu-XlDRQ\">@onehotgreasymechanic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNmpNeF1IEvFJtdv3jBcRxQ\">@musette22</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqR7L2ZIFzB7SrwVS7x8COw\">@riricitaa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3ba3CVEdGlg7Ecpb1Hu2Aw\">@wildestdreamsimpossiblethings</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzuqLDD_cI7b62ljq4uB-_g\">@time-travel-bouqet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miOmMdBBsBXQDxINdiEuFgA\">@the-wayward-robot</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkp4VvoKIpsrDxZYOAcilNQ\">@wintersoldier1989</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meWnmsuwyDZnhglX6ucOlZA\">@nade2308</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFt6Kcxr-Uk-Gf_1q_OU1Dw\">@book-dragon-13</a> </p>",

It explained why he was still in Chris\u2019 hotel room long after the others had left, still playing Truth or Dare with Chris way after all the others had bowed out, sitting next to him on a small leather couch with their knees pressed casually together. He might die before the night was over but he really couldn\u2019t think of a better way to go. </p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>The game had devolved into a series of have you ever\u2019s, dares not really coming into the equation anymore, and that was fine. Sebastian was having fun getting to know Chris better and Chris seemed to be doing the same, and Sebastian got comfortable enough to ask him things he\u2019d never have the courage to ask him sober. </p><p><br></p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it, really - sitting there so close to Chris, watching him throw his head back and laugh, watching his throat work as he drank on his beer, the way that he licked his lips and eyes lit up when he\u2019d tell an outrageous story from back in Boston\u2026. <i>God</i> Sebastian was smitten. He was already smitten, of course, but <i>this</i>\u2026 this made it so much worse. </p><p><br></p><p>And Chris, he was such a flirt. It came to him as naturally as breathing, and while Sebastian was used to it, he just didn\u2019t know if Chris really meant it or if he just did it to do it. He wanted Chris to mean it, all those teasing little touches and playful looks he\u2019d shoot Sebastian, but he only ever seemed to date women and Sebastian just needed to finally <i>know</i>. </p><p><br></p><p>And that was why, when it was Sebastian\u2019s turn again, he finally blurted out the question he\u2019d been wanting to ask Chris for months. Years even, maybe. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou ever kiss a guy?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris shook his head as he swallowed from his beer bottle, setting it between his legs. \u201cNope. Never.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cReally? Never?\u201d Sebastian asked, his hopes deflating a little. Surely if Chris wanted to experiment with a man, he\u2019d have done so by now. \u201cNot even\u2026 never?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris chuckled and shook his head again. \u201cNah. You?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know I have.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh, right, the - your roles,\u201d Chris nodded, gesturing vaguely with his hand. \u201cBut I mean, y\u2019know - a real kiss.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian blushed a little, looking down at his own beer nestled in his hands in his lap. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve, uh\u2026 yeah.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian nodded, daring to peek at Chris, knowing he looked much shyer about it than he really was. \u201cYeah. A lot.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Chris paused, cocking his head curiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me,\u201d Sebastian grinned with a playfully mysterious look, and they both laughed at that. It didn\u2019t stop Sebastian\u2019s heart from racing, the current subject matter more than enough to make him fight breaking into a sweat. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s my turn to ask a question,\u201d Sebastian protested. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou can just double up next time,\u201d Chris waved him off. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian raised a brow. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSlept with men,\u201d Chris said, that curious glint still in his pretty blue eyes. </p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian blushed and wanted to scream a little, but he kept it all hidden inside. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris eyed him silently, something in his expression that Sebastian couldn\u2019t quite place. It made him even more nervous, a thrill running through his veins as he felt a little exposed, like Chris was examining him for\u2026 something. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris took another drink without taking his eyes off of Sebastian. Sebastian licked his lips and - <i>oh God</i>, Chris watched him do it and <i>fuck</i> - </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Sebastian said a bit shakily, too shakily. \u201cYou ever thought about it?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He didn\u2019t need to specify what it was for Chris to get it. He blinked once, then twice, then looked away as he shrugged one massive shoulder and muttered, \u201cI mean\u2026 everybody has, right?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut I mean really thought about it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes snapped to Seb\u2019s, the air between them growing more tense with each second that passed. \u201cFew times.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s stomach flipped. He had another question before it was Chris\u2019 turn again, so he asked before he could think better of it, \u201cWould you ever try it?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Chris answered surprisingly quickly. \u201cWith the right person.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian was already getting hard in his jeans. Just talking about this with Chris and seeing the look on his face, the open curiosity, the hint of something else\u2026 </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow do you\u2026 what do you\u2026.\u201d Chris faltered for a moment, unsure of how to ask his next question. Finally he just decided out with it. \u201cYou top or bottom?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s heart skipped a few beats and he knew his face was on fire. \u201cBoth. But I like bottoming the most.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 brows inches up fractionally and Seb could have sworn he heard him mutter a low <i>fuck</i> under his breath. Then he looked back at Sebastian and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s it feel like?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian had to look away to answer, briefly closing his eyes before taking a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s <i>really</i> fucking good. It can be overwhelming. You feel so full and you just\u2026 you feel things you didn\u2019t think were even possible. It\u2019s addicting.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>It took awhile before Sebastian could bring himself to meet Chris\u2019 gaze again. When he did he found Chris staring at him, expression maddeningly unreadable. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Chris murmured. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you so curious about me?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris smirked a little bit, the bastard. \u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian wanted to groan and bang his head into the nearest hard surface, but instead he sighed and gestured for Chris to go next. He never could have prepared himself for what came next. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf I asked you to come here\u2026 and let me try something\u2026 would you?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s eyes flew to Chris\u2019 in shock, finding the dark and slightly hungry look on his face and wondering if he\u2019d fallen asleep and this was all a drunken dream. But even if it was, he was sure as hell gonna take advantage of it. \u201cI\u2026 <i>yeah</i>, fuck.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris then set his beer aside and adjusted a little where he sat, widening his legs a little and giving a tiny, somehow arousing jerk of his head. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian went to him so fast he would later remember nothing about it, seemingly teleporting himself on to Chris\u2019 lap before he could so much as draw a breath. He straddled those wonderfully muscular thighs and watched as Chris looked him over, his hands cautiously coming to rest on Sebastian\u2019s denim-clad hips. Sebastian wasn\u2019t sure what to do with his hands so he held on to the back of the couch with one hand and let the other hang at his sides. </p><p><br></p><p>Neither of them spoke at first, Chris slowly letting his hands drift up Sebastian\u2019s sides. \u201cFuck,\u201d Chris muttered appreciatively as he dragged his eyes up Seb\u2019s torso, watching his own hands move up. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so fuckin\u2019 big.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian shuddered, fairly sure he could come just from Chris\u2019 innocent touches and his words. \u201cYeah, trying\u2026 tryin\u2019 to keep up with you,\u201d he replied breathlessly. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris grinned up at him briefly before slowly dragging Sebastian\u2019s shirt up, exposing his hard-earned abs. He kept moving the fabric up, up, up until it had nowhere to go but off, and suddenly Sebastian found himself shirtless in Chris\u2019 lap. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris leaned back an inch or two to fully take him in, getting braver with his hands as he placed them on Sebastian\u2019s stomach and let them feel him, slowly moving upwards. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking gorgeous, Seb. Always thought so.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian made some kind of noise in his throat like the wind had been knocked out of him, his hand on the couch slipping down to grip Chris\u2019 shoulder. Chris didn\u2019t seem to mind, though he was preoccupied with sliding his palms over Sebastian\u2019s impressive pecs. \u201c<i>Chris</i> -\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>Then those hands were on Seb\u2019s shoulders, fingers gently and briefly touching the ends of his long hair before trailing down his broad back. Sebastian\u2019s skin erupted into flame everywhere Chris touched him, every point of contact going straight to his cock and making him feel like he might burst at any moment. He was sure that he\u2019d never been so turned on, and they hadn\u2019t even kissed. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 hands ended up on Sebastian\u2019s ass, gripping it through his jeans, and the little gasp that left Sebastian\u2019s lips made Chris grin and lean his head forward. Sebastian felt hot breath on his chest and his entire body tensed, cock throbbing in his jeans as Chris squeezed, lips just barely brushing his skin\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Then Chris slid his hands <i>into</i> Sebastian\u2019s jeans, gripping his ass hard and pulling him closer, rocking them together through their jeans, and Sebastian moaned because it felt so good and <i>Chris was hard too</i>, but nothing could have prepared him for the sudden flick of a hot tongue on a sensitive nipple. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh my God, <i>Chris</i>,\u201d Sebastian whined, free hand moving to the back of Chris\u2019 head on instinct, hips moving on their own accord to grind down on Chris\u2019 lap. Chris replied by wrapping his lips around his nipple and sucking and Sebastian couldn\u2019t take it, his entire body feeling like a live wire. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris pulled away to look up into Sebastian\u2019s already-wrecked face, Chris\u2019 pupils dilated and cheeks flushed and yeah, <i>God</i> he was into this, too. \u201cYou\u2019re so hard, Seb\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Sebastian retorted, voice low and broken-sounding as he rocked in Chris\u2019 lap, the friction as delicious as it was frustrating. Chris dug his fingers in hard as a reply, and Sebastian moaned and hoped there\u2019d be bruises later. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re noisy,\u201d Chris noted with delight, pulling one hand free only to press it against the front of Sebastian\u2019s jeans, gripping him there experimentally. Sebastian stopped rocking and let another breathless sound leave his throat. \u201cDamn. Barely touching you and you\u2019re this loud\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian simply whimpered as Chris started rubbing him, letting his head drop forward and almost press against Chris\u2019 forehead. \u201cChris\u2026 <i>God</i>, Chris -\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 voice was deep and soothing, like something out of Sebastian\u2019s fantasies. \u201cYeah, Seb. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted so many fucking things, none of which were going to happen right now because - \u201cM\u2019gonna come,\u201d he whispered, trying to hold back but it just wasn\u2019t gonna happen, not when he\u2019d been on the edge since the first time Chris\u2019 hands landed on him. \u201cFuck, Chris, I\u2019m -\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cJust from this?\u201d Chris grinned, clearly enjoying his effect upon his friend. \u201cThis all it takes, baby?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian pressed harder into his hand and gripped Chris\u2019 hair hard, mouth falling open and body all but singing at being called <i>baby</i> by this man. He chanted Chris\u2019 name in whispers and Chris tightened his hand and moved it harder, head ducking down to lick across his nipples again and that was it, Sebastian was gone and coming hard in his pants, hard enough to nearly ascend to another plane of existence. </p><p><br></p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt anything so intense. When he was recovered enough to remember where he was, his face was buried in Chris\u2019 neck and Chris was running soothing fingers up and down Sebastian\u2019s back. Sebastian slowly raised his head, meeting Chris\u2019 still-hungry gaze and expecting to wake up from this dream any second. </p><p><br></p><p>But instead of waking up, Chris tilted Sebastian\u2019s chin up with a single long finger and leaned in to kiss him. It was soft and unexpected and Sebastian melted, exhaling shakily when Chris pulled away and their eyes met again. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris licked his lips, as if tasting Sebastian on them. \u201cI think I like this.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian didn\u2019t give himself any time to smile or give some kind of witty reply. Instead he kissed Chris like his life depended on it, having no idea if he\u2019d ever get the chance to do this again and wanting to make the most of it while he could. And when Chris responded with a groan and the plunge of his tongue in Sebastian\u2019s mouth, Seb knew he\u2019d picked the right course of action. </p><p><br></p><p>They kissed and kissed and kissed, Sebastian not caring one bit about the mess in his pants as he memorized the feel of Chris\u2019s lips on his, tongues tangling together and hands drifting all over the place. He wished that it could last forever, more than happy to while away eternity kissing the hell out of Chris Evans in his lap, but he knew that it couldn\u2019t and anyway Chris was still rock hard beneath him. And he knew just how he wanted to take him apart. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d Sebastian huffed against Chris\u2019 lips, tugging impatiently at his shirt. They broke apart and Chris all but tore off his shirt, dropping it behind the couch and watching as Sebastian took him in. </p><p><br></p><p>He\u2019d seen Chris shirtless before plenty of times, of course. The whole world had. But  he\u2019d never seen him shirtless like this, up close and able to feel that perfect skin beneath his fingertips. He dragged his fingers all over him, through his chest hair and over his nipples, down his ribs and to his abs, and then he ducked down and let his mouth follow. He was gonna taste every inch of Chris that he could, and Chris was happy to let him.</p><p><br></p><p>Chris ran his fingers through Seb\u2019s hair as he made his way down, holding it back so that he could watch Sebastian unimpeded by a curtain of hair over his face. Chris didn\u2019t hold back his own sounds as Sebastian tasted him all over, those pouty lips becoming acquainted with Chris\u2019 body and making him ache in his jeans, the whole thing something he\u2019d never known that he\u2019d needed until now. But he had no idea what he was in for, not really. </p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian wasted no time in getting Chris\u2019 jeans undone once he reached them, impatient in getting them and Chris\u2019 underwear down far enough to free the cock he\u2019d spent longer than he\u2019d ever admit fantasizing about. Turned out that the real thing was even better, large and so damn hard and like velvet in his hand, leaking and throbbing and the fact that Sebastian was the reason for it\u2026 <i>God</i> he might just be ruined for anyone else after this. </p><p><br></p><p>On his knees between Chris\u2019 legs, Sebastian stroked him slow and firm, watching as more pre-come leaked out, and when he leaned in to lick it off Chris made a sound that Sebastian would never forget. Sebastian peeked up at him, maintaining eye contact as he continued to stroke him and lick him, closing his eyes only when he finally wrapped his lips around the tip and moaned like it was the best thing he\u2019d ever tasted. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFuck, Seb,\u201d Chris gasped, fingers tightening in Sebastian\u2019s hair as he swallowed him down. Chris watched every bit of it, mouth open and brows furrowed and a blush visible on his cheeks and chest as Sebastian showed off just how good he was at this. And he really was - he took pride in how good he was with his mouth, how he could bring a man to his knees like this and make even the quietest of them beg for more. But he wasn\u2019t gonna make Chris beg. All he wanted was to hear his name on Chris\u2019 lips as he came in his mouth - he\u2019d wanted that for so long. </p><p><br></p><p>He took his time getting there, however, not going too slow nor too fast, wanting this to be perfect for Chris. He looked up as he worked, watching the muscles in Chris\u2019 torso flex and relax, tightening every time Sebastian did something with his tongue that Chris really liked. Sebastian couldn\u2019t help but reach up to touch him with his free hand, running it everywhere he could reach, sometimes playing with a nipple and watching Chris gasp with all the warring sensations. </p><p><br></p><p>But it wasn\u2019t long before Chris reached the end of his rope, needing more and not being afraid to demand it. \u201cC\u2019mon Seb, faster, harder, baby. You feel so fuckin\u2019 good, I\u2019ve <i>gotta</i> have more, please\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian couldn\u2019t have denied him even if he\u2019d wanted to. He grabbed Chris\u2019 hand and placed it back in his hair, and Chris held on tight as Sebastian dove back in and focused on giving Chris everything he wanted. He sucked him off like it was his mission in life, like he wanted nothing more than to see Chris lose it and spill in his mouth, and if that was the truth, well\u2026 nobody could blame him. </p><p><br></p><p>It was only minutes then when he felt Chris tensing, fingers and abs tightening and breaths coming hard, sweet little sounds leaving his lips getting more and more desperate. Sebastian took him all the way down, deep throating him and showing no mercy, giving him everything he wanted and then some. His only warning was a rush of deep, breathy <i>Seb, Seb, God baby</i> and then Chris was coming and coming and Sebastian was happy to utterly drown in him. </p><p><br></p><p>He swallowed every drop and was careful to clean Chris up the best that he could, tucking him back into his pants as Chris laid boneless and panting on the couch. Sebastian grinned at the debauched sight that he made, taking a mental picture before climbing up back into Chris\u2019 lap and kissing the corner of his mouth softly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat fuckin\u2019 mouth of yours,\u201d Chris groaned, eyes still closed but his arms wrapping loosely around his friend and maybe lover. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian grinned with pride and nuzzled his jaw. \u201cGlad you liked it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI loved it,\u201d Chris replied, opening his eyes and meeting Sebastian\u2019s gaze. \u201cI loved it all.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Sebastian murmured, blushing a little. </p><p><br></p><p>They stayed there like that, still basking in the afterglow and the unexpected bliss of it all, until Chris sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty late.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian stiffened, thinking that Chris was going to gently show him the door now. \u201cYeah, yeah. I should g-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStay over?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>They spoke the words at the same time, then smiled and chuckled together as Sebastian exhaled with relief. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he replied, leaning in and brushing a kiss across Chris\u2019 lips. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Chris murmured with a faint grin, \u201cbecause I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m done with you yet.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i>God</i> Sebastian hoped he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAidATIEpHEyeBI44BIGmZg\">@captainrogerrsbeard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7eywmAnCn-B194usnbb0g\">@take-me-tom-hiddleston</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF4C3vOwxZjEWzQJ3tQMjCw\">@supersmuttyqueernerd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msRbKovV7RdgRgAhW2eVEOA\">@freshwoods</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJFoEDHp53CswU_ZHWCm1qA\">@ravensonata</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJxgalB5nL0TlWqrSNHemqA\">@lisamott9</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwhx6YCBRC0o8pVLu-XlDRQ\">@onehotgreasymechanic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNmpNeF1IEvFJtdv3jBcRxQ\">@musette22</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqR7L2ZIFzB7SrwVS7x8COw\">@riricitaa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3ba3CVEdGlg7Ecpb1Hu2Aw\">@wildestdreamsimpossiblethings</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzuqLDD_cI7b62ljq4uB-_g\">@time-travel-bouqet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miOmMdBBsBXQDxINdiEuFgA\">@the-wayward-robot</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkp4VvoKIpsrDxZYOAcilNQ\">@wintersoldier1989</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meWnmsuwyDZnhglX6ucOlZA\">@nade2308</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFt6Kcxr-Uk-Gf_1q_OU1Dw\">@book-dragon-13</a> </p>",

This is just some good ol\u2019 fashioned Evanstan smut that I felt like writing today \ud83d\ude02 hope you guys like it sjjsjsjs</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>It was late as hell and Sebastian was drunk, drunk enough to make some extremely questionable decisions and not give a single fuck as to whether he\u2019d regret it in the morning. It explained why he was still in Chris\u2019 hotel room long after the others had left, still playing Truth or Dare with Chris way after all the others had bowed out, sitting next to him on a small leather couch with their knees pressed casually together. He might die before the night was over but he really couldn\u2019t think of a better way to go. </p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>The game had devolved into a series of have you ever\u2019s, dares not really coming into the equation anymore, and that was fine. Sebastian was having fun getting to know Chris better and Chris seemed to be doing the same, and Sebastian got comfortable enough to ask him things he\u2019d never have the courage to ask him sober. </p><p><br></p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it, really - sitting there so close to Chris, watching him throw his head back and laugh, watching his throat work as he drank on his beer, the way that he licked his lips and eyes lit up when he\u2019d tell an outrageous story from back in Boston\u2026. <i>God</i> Sebastian was smitten. He was already smitten, of course, but <i>this</i>\u2026 this made it so much worse. </p><p><br></p><p>And Chris, he was such a flirt. It came to him as naturally as breathing, and while Sebastian was used to it, he just didn\u2019t know if Chris really meant it or if he just did it to do it. He wanted Chris to mean it, all those teasing little touches and playful looks he\u2019d shoot Sebastian, but he only ever seemed to date women and Sebastian just needed to finally <i>know</i>. </p><p><br></p><p>And that was why, when it was Sebastian\u2019s turn again, he finally blurted out the question he\u2019d been wanting to ask Chris for months. Years even, maybe. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou ever kiss a guy?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris shook his head as he swallowed from his beer bottle, setting it between his legs. \u201cNope. Never.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cReally? Never?\u201d Sebastian asked, his hopes deflating a little. Surely if Chris wanted to experiment with a man, he\u2019d have done so by now. \u201cNot even\u2026 never?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris chuckled and shook his head again. \u201cNah. You?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know I have.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh, right, the - your roles,\u201d Chris nodded, gesturing vaguely with his hand. \u201cBut I mean, y\u2019know - a real kiss.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian blushed a little, looking down at his own beer nestled in his hands in his lap. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve, uh\u2026 yeah.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian nodded, daring to peek at Chris, knowing he looked much shyer about it than he really was. \u201cYeah. A lot.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Chris paused, cocking his head curiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me,\u201d Sebastian grinned with a playfully mysterious look, and they both laughed at that. It didn\u2019t stop Sebastian\u2019s heart from racing, the current subject matter more than enough to make him fight breaking into a sweat. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s my turn to ask a question,\u201d Sebastian protested. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou can just double up next time,\u201d Chris waved him off. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian raised a brow. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSlept with men,\u201d Chris said, that curious glint still in his pretty blue eyes. </p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian blushed and wanted to scream a little, but he kept it all hidden inside. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris eyed him silently, something in his expression that Sebastian couldn\u2019t quite place. It made him even more nervous, a thrill running through his veins as he felt a little exposed, like Chris was examining him for\u2026 something. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris took another drink without taking his eyes off of Sebastian. Sebastian licked his lips and - <i>oh God</i>, Chris watched him do it and <i>fuck</i> - </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Sebastian said a bit shakily, too shakily. \u201cYou ever thought about it?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He didn\u2019t need to specify what it was for Chris to get it. He blinked once, then twice, then looked away as he shrugged one massive shoulder and muttered, \u201cI mean\u2026 everybody has, right?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cBut I mean really thought about it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 eyes snapped to Seb\u2019s, the air between them growing more tense with each second that passed. \u201cFew times.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s stomach flipped. He had another question before it was Chris\u2019 turn again, so he asked before he could think better of it, \u201cWould you ever try it?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Chris answered surprisingly quickly. \u201cWith the right person.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian was already getting hard in his jeans. Just talking about this with Chris and seeing the look on his face, the open curiosity, the hint of something else\u2026 </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow do you\u2026 what do you\u2026.\u201d Chris faltered for a moment, unsure of how to ask his next question. Finally he just decided out with it. \u201cYou top or bottom?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s heart skipped a few beats and he knew his face was on fire. \u201cBoth. But I like bottoming the most.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 brows inches up fractionally and Seb could have sworn he heard him mutter a low <i>fuck</i> under his breath. Then he looked back at Sebastian and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s it feel like?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian had to look away to answer, briefly closing his eyes before taking a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s <i>really</i> fucking good. It can be overwhelming. You feel so full and you just\u2026 you feel things you didn\u2019t think were even possible. It\u2019s addicting.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>It took awhile before Sebastian could bring himself to meet Chris\u2019 gaze again. When he did he found Chris staring at him, expression maddeningly unreadable. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Chris murmured. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you so curious about me?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris smirked a little bit, the bastard. \u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian wanted to groan and bang his head into the nearest hard surface, but instead he sighed and gestured for Chris to go next. He never could have prepared himself for what came next. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf I asked you to come here\u2026 and let me try something\u2026 would you?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian\u2019s eyes flew to Chris\u2019 in shock, finding the dark and slightly hungry look on his face and wondering if he\u2019d fallen asleep and this was all a drunken dream. But even if it was, he was sure as hell gonna take advantage of it. \u201cI\u2026 <i>yeah</i>, fuck.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Chris then set his beer aside and adjusted a little where he sat, widening his legs a little and giving a tiny, somehow arousing jerk of his head. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian went to him so fast he would later remember nothing about it, seemingly teleporting himself on to Chris\u2019 lap before he could so much as draw a breath. He straddled those wonderfully muscular thighs and watched as Chris looked him over, his hands cautiously coming to rest on Sebastian\u2019s denim-clad hips. Sebastian wasn\u2019t sure what to do with his hands so he held on to the back of the couch with one hand and let the other hang at his sides. </p><p><br></p><p>Neither of them spoke at first, Chris slowly letting his hands drift up Sebastian\u2019s sides. \u201cFuck,\u201d Chris muttered appreciatively as he dragged his eyes up Seb\u2019s torso, watching his own hands move up. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so fuckin\u2019 big.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian shuddered, fairly sure he could come just from Chris\u2019 innocent touches and his words. \u201cYeah, trying\u2026 tryin\u2019 to keep up with you,\u201d he replied breathlessly. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris grinned up at him briefly before slowly dragging Sebastian\u2019s shirt up, exposing his hard-earned abs. He kept moving the fabric up, up, up until it had nowhere to go but off, and suddenly Sebastian found himself shirtless in Chris\u2019 lap. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris leaned back an inch or two to fully take him in, getting braver with his hands as he placed them on Sebastian\u2019s stomach and let them feel him, slowly moving upwards. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking gorgeous, Seb. Always thought so.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian made some kind of noise in his throat like the wind had been knocked out of him, his hand on the couch slipping down to grip Chris\u2019 shoulder. Chris didn\u2019t seem to mind, though he was preoccupied with sliding his palms over Sebastian\u2019s impressive pecs. \u201c<i>Chris</i> -\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>Then those hands were on Seb\u2019s shoulders, fingers gently and briefly touching the ends of his long hair before trailing down his broad back. Sebastian\u2019s skin erupted into flame everywhere Chris touched him, every point of contact going straight to his cock and making him feel like he might burst at any moment. He was sure that he\u2019d never been so turned on, and they hadn\u2019t even kissed. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 hands ended up on Sebastian\u2019s ass, gripping it through his jeans, and the little gasp that left Sebastian\u2019s lips made Chris grin and lean his head forward. Sebastian felt hot breath on his chest and his entire body tensed, cock throbbing in his jeans as Chris squeezed, lips just barely brushing his skin\u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Then Chris slid his hands <i>into</i> Sebastian\u2019s jeans, gripping his ass hard and pulling him closer, rocking them together through their jeans, and Sebastian moaned because it felt so good and <i>Chris was hard too</i>, but nothing could have prepared him for the sudden flick of a hot tongue on a sensitive nipple. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh my God, <i>Chris</i>,\u201d Sebastian whined, free hand moving to the back of Chris\u2019 head on instinct, hips moving on their own accord to grind down on Chris\u2019 lap. Chris replied by wrapping his lips around his nipple and sucking and Sebastian couldn\u2019t take it, his entire body feeling like a live wire. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris pulled away to look up into Sebastian\u2019s already-wrecked face, Chris\u2019 pupils dilated and cheeks flushed and yeah, <i>God</i> he was into this, too. \u201cYou\u2019re so hard, Seb\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Sebastian retorted, voice low and broken-sounding as he rocked in Chris\u2019 lap, the friction as delicious as it was frustrating. Chris dug his fingers in hard as a reply, and Sebastian moaned and hoped there\u2019d be bruises later. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re noisy,\u201d Chris noted with delight, pulling one hand free only to press it against the front of Sebastian\u2019s jeans, gripping him there experimentally. Sebastian stopped rocking and let another breathless sound leave his throat. \u201cDamn. Barely touching you and you\u2019re this loud\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian simply whimpered as Chris started rubbing him, letting his head drop forward and almost press against Chris\u2019 forehead. \u201cChris\u2026 <i>God</i>, Chris -\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>Chris\u2019 voice was deep and soothing, like something out of Sebastian\u2019s fantasies. \u201cYeah, Seb. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>He wanted so many fucking things, none of which were going to happen right now because - \u201cM\u2019gonna come,\u201d he whispered, trying to hold back but it just wasn\u2019t gonna happen, not when he\u2019d been on the edge since the first time Chris\u2019 hands landed on him. \u201cFuck, Chris, I\u2019m -\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cJust from this?\u201d Chris grinned, clearly enjoying his effect upon his friend. \u201cThis all it takes, baby?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian pressed harder into his hand and gripped Chris\u2019 hair hard, mouth falling open and body all but singing at being called <i>baby</i> by this man. He chanted Chris\u2019 name in whispers and Chris tightened his hand and moved it harder, head ducking down to lick across his nipples again and that was it, Sebastian was gone and coming hard in his pants, hard enough to nearly ascend to another plane of existence. </p><p><br></p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt anything so intense. When he was recovered enough to remember where he was, his face was buried in Chris\u2019 neck and Chris was running soothing fingers up and down Sebastian\u2019s back. Sebastian slowly raised his head, meeting Chris\u2019 still-hungry gaze and expecting to wake up from this dream any second. </p><p><br></p><p>But instead of waking up, Chris tilted Sebastian\u2019s chin up with a single long finger and leaned in to kiss him. It was soft and unexpected and Sebastian melted, exhaling shakily when Chris pulled away and their eyes met again. </p><p><br></p><p>Chris licked his lips, as if tasting Sebastian on them. \u201cI think I like this.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian didn\u2019t give himself any time to smile or give some kind of witty reply. Instead he kissed Chris like his life depended on it, having no idea if he\u2019d ever get the chance to do this again and wanting to make the most of it while he could. And when Chris responded with a groan and the plunge of his tongue in Sebastian\u2019s mouth, Seb knew he\u2019d picked the right course of action. </p><p><br></p><p>They kissed and kissed and kissed, Sebastian not caring one bit about the mess in his pants as he memorized the feel of Chris\u2019s lips on his, tongues tangling together and hands drifting all over the place. He wished that it could last forever, more than happy to while away eternity kissing the hell out of Chris Evans in his lap, but he knew that it couldn\u2019t and anyway Chris was still rock hard beneath him. And he knew just how he wanted to take him apart. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d Sebastian huffed against Chris\u2019 lips, tugging impatiently at his shirt. They broke apart and Chris all but tore off his shirt, dropping it behind the couch and watching as Sebastian took him in. </p><p><br></p><p>He\u2019d seen Chris shirtless before plenty of times, of course. The whole world had. But  he\u2019d never seen him shirtless like this, up close and able to feel that perfect skin beneath his fingertips. He dragged his fingers all over him, through his chest hair and over his nipples, down his ribs and to his abs, and then he ducked down and let his mouth follow. He was gonna taste every inch of Chris that he could, and Chris was happy to let him.</p><p><br></p><p>Chris ran his fingers through Seb\u2019s hair as he made his way down, holding it back so that he could watch Sebastian unimpeded by a curtain of hair over his face. Chris didn\u2019t hold back his own sounds as Sebastian tasted him all over, those pouty lips becoming acquainted with Chris\u2019 body and making him ache in his jeans, the whole thing something he\u2019d never known that he\u2019d needed until now. But he had no idea what he was in for, not really. </p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian wasted no time in getting Chris\u2019 jeans undone once he reached them, impatient in getting them and Chris\u2019 underwear down far enough to free the cock he\u2019d spent longer than he\u2019d ever admit fantasizing about. Turned out that the real thing was even better, large and so damn hard and like velvet in his hand, leaking and throbbing and the fact that Sebastian was the reason for it\u2026 <i>God</i> he might just be ruined for anyone else after this. </p><p><br></p><p>On his knees between Chris\u2019 legs, Sebastian stroked him slow and firm, watching as more pre-come leaked out, and when he leaned in to lick it off Chris made a sound that Sebastian would never forget. Sebastian peeked up at him, maintaining eye contact as he continued to stroke him and lick him, closing his eyes only when he finally wrapped his lips around the tip and moaned like it was the best thing he\u2019d ever tasted. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cFuck, Seb,\u201d Chris gasped, fingers tightening in Sebastian\u2019s hair as he swallowed him down. Chris watched every bit of it, mouth open and brows furrowed and a blush visible on his cheeks and chest as Sebastian showed off just how good he was at this. And he really was - he took pride in how good he was with his mouth, how he could bring a man to his knees like this and make even the quietest of them beg for more. But he wasn\u2019t gonna make Chris beg. All he wanted was to hear his name on Chris\u2019 lips as he came in his mouth - he\u2019d wanted that for so long. </p><p><br></p><p>He took his time getting there, however, not going too slow nor too fast, wanting this to be perfect for Chris. He looked up as he worked, watching the muscles in Chris\u2019 torso flex and relax, tightening every time Sebastian did something with his tongue that Chris really liked. Sebastian couldn\u2019t help but reach up to touch him with his free hand, running it everywhere he could reach, sometimes playing with a nipple and watching Chris gasp with all the warring sensations. </p><p><br></p><p>But it wasn\u2019t long before Chris reached the end of his rope, needing more and not being afraid to demand it. \u201cC\u2019mon Seb, faster, harder, baby. You feel so fuckin\u2019 good, I\u2019ve <i>gotta</i> have more, please\u2026\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian couldn\u2019t have denied him even if he\u2019d wanted to. He grabbed Chris\u2019 hand and placed it back in his hair, and Chris held on tight as Sebastian dove back in and focused on giving Chris everything he wanted. He sucked him off like it was his mission in life, like he wanted nothing more than to see Chris lose it and spill in his mouth, and if that was the truth, well\u2026 nobody could blame him. </p><p><br></p><p>It was only minutes then when he felt Chris tensing, fingers and abs tightening and breaths coming hard, sweet little sounds leaving his lips getting more and more desperate. Sebastian took him all the way down, deep throating him and showing no mercy, giving him everything he wanted and then some. His only warning was a rush of deep, breathy <i>Seb, Seb, God baby</i> and then Chris was coming and coming and Sebastian was happy to utterly drown in him. </p><p><br></p><p>He swallowed every drop and was careful to clean Chris up the best that he could, tucking him back into his pants as Chris laid boneless and panting on the couch. Sebastian grinned at the debauched sight that he made, taking a mental picture before climbing up back into Chris\u2019 lap and kissing the corner of his mouth softly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat fuckin\u2019 mouth of yours,\u201d Chris groaned, eyes still closed but his arms wrapping loosely around his friend and maybe lover. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian grinned with pride and nuzzled his jaw. \u201cGlad you liked it.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI loved it,\u201d Chris replied, opening his eyes and meeting Sebastian\u2019s gaze. \u201cI loved it all.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Sebastian murmured, blushing a little. </p><p><br></p><p>They stayed there like that, still basking in the afterglow and the unexpected bliss of it all, until Chris sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty late.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian stiffened, thinking that Chris was going to gently show him the door now. \u201cYeah, yeah. I should g-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStay over?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>They spoke the words at the same time, then smiled and chuckled together as Sebastian exhaled with relief. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he replied, leaning in and brushing a kiss across Chris\u2019 lips. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Chris murmured with a faint grin, \u201cbecause I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m done with you yet.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i>God</i> Sebastian hoped he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Taglist: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAidATIEpHEyeBI44BIGmZg\">@captainrogerrsbeard</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7eywmAnCn-B194usnbb0g\">@take-me-tom-hiddleston</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF4C3vOwxZjEWzQJ3tQMjCw\">@supersmuttyqueernerd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msRbKovV7RdgRgAhW2eVEOA\">@freshwoods</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJFoEDHp53CswU_ZHWCm1qA\">@ravensonata</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJxgalB5nL0TlWqrSNHemqA\">@lisamott9</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwhx6YCBRC0o8pVLu-XlDRQ\">@onehotgreasymechanic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNmpNeF1IEvFJtdv3jBcRxQ\">@musette22</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqR7L2ZIFzB7SrwVS7x8COw\">@riricitaa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3ba3CVEdGlg7Ecpb1Hu2Aw\">@wildestdreamsimpossiblethings</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzuqLDD_cI7b62ljq4uB-_g\">@time-travel-bouqet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/miOmMdBBsBXQDxINdiEuFgA\">@the-wayward-robot</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkp4VvoKIpsrDxZYOAcilNQ\">@wintersoldier1989</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meWnmsuwyDZnhglX6ucOlZA\">@nade2308</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFt6Kcxr-Uk-Gf_1q_OU1Dw\">@book-dragon-13</a> </p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Title</b>: Have You Ever</p><p><b>Rating</b>: E</p><p><b>Pairing</b>: Chris Evans x Sebastian Stan</p><p><b>Word coun</b>t: 3.1k </p><p><b>Summary</b>: While filming Civil War in Europe, an innocent game of Truth or Dare takes a turn that Sebastian always hoped for but never quite believed would happen. </p><p><b>A/N: </b>So idk where this came from and I&rsquo;ve got eleventy billion other things to write but &#129335;&#127995;&zwj;&#9792;&#65039; just to clarify, this is <i>not</i> the watersports Evanstan fic that I teased a little while ago, though that&rsquo;s in progress and should be done soon. This is just some good ol&rsquo; fashioned Evanstan smut that I felt like writing today &#128514; hope you guys like it sjjsjsjs</p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;</p><p><br /></p><p>It was late as hell and Sebastian was drunk, drunk enough to make some extremely questionable decisions and not give a single fuck as to whether he&rsquo;d regret it in the morning. It explained why he was still in Chris&rsquo; hotel room long after the others had left, still playing Truth or Dare with Chris way after all the others had bowed out, sitting next to him on a small leather couch with their knees pressed casually together. He might die before the night was over but he really couldn&rsquo;t think of a better way to go. </p><p>The game had devolved into a series of have you ever&rsquo;s, dares not really coming into the equation anymore, and that was fine. Sebastian was having fun getting to know Chris better and Chris seemed to be doing the same, and Sebastian got comfortable enough to ask him things he&rsquo;d never have the courage to ask him sober. </p><p><br /></p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t help it, really - sitting there so close to Chris, watching him throw his head back and laugh, watching his throat work as he drank on his beer, the way that he licked his lips and eyes lit up when he&rsquo;d tell an outrageous story from back in Boston&hellip;. <i>God</i> Sebastian was smitten. He was already smitten, of course, but <i>this</i>&hellip; this made it so much worse. </p><p><br /></p><p>And Chris, he was such a flirt. It came to him as naturally as breathing, and while Sebastian was used to it, he just didn&rsquo;t know if Chris really meant it or if he just did it to do it. He wanted Chris to mean it, all those teasing little touches and playful looks he&rsquo;d shoot Sebastian, but he only ever seemed to date women and Sebastian just needed to finally <i>know</i>. </p><p><br /></p><p>And that was why, when it was Sebastian&rsquo;s turn again, he finally blurted out the question he&rsquo;d been wanting to ask Chris for months. Years even, maybe. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You ever kiss a guy?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris shook his head as he swallowed from his beer bottle, setting it between his legs. &ldquo;Nope. Never.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Really? Never?&rdquo; Sebastian asked, his hopes deflating a little. Surely if Chris wanted to experiment with a man, he&rsquo;d have done so by now. &ldquo;Not even&hellip; never?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris chuckled and shook his head again. &ldquo;Nah. You?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian rolled his eyes. &ldquo;You know I have.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right, the - your roles,&rdquo; Chris nodded, gesturing vaguely with his hand. &ldquo;But I mean, y&rsquo;know - a real kiss.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian blushed a little, looking down at his own beer nestled in his hands in his lap. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve, uh&hellip; yeah.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian nodded, daring to peek at Chris, knowing he looked much shyer about it than he really was. &ldquo;Yeah. A lot.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Chris paused, cocking his head curiously. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a lot you don&rsquo;t know about me,&rdquo; Sebastian grinned with a playfully mysterious look, and they both laughed at that. It didn&rsquo;t stop Sebastian&rsquo;s heart from racing, the current subject matter more than enough to make him fight breaking into a sweat. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;ve&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s my turn to ask a question,&rdquo; Sebastian protested. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can just double up next time,&rdquo; Chris waved him off. &ldquo;So&hellip; you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian raised a brow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Slept with men,&rdquo; Chris said, that curious glint still in his pretty blue eyes. </p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian blushed and wanted to scream a little, but he kept it all hidden inside. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris eyed him silently, something in his expression that Sebastian couldn&rsquo;t quite place. It made him even more nervous, a thrill running through his veins as he felt a little exposed, like Chris was examining him for&hellip; something. </p><p><br /></p><p>Chris took another drink without taking his eyes off of Sebastian. Sebastian licked his lips and - <i>oh God</i>, Chris watched him do it and <i>fuck</i> - </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;My turn,&rdquo; Sebastian said a bit shakily, too shakily. &ldquo;You ever thought about it?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t need to specify what it was for Chris to get it. He blinked once, then twice, then looked away as he shrugged one massive shoulder and muttered, &ldquo;I mean&hellip; everybody has, right?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;But I mean really thought about it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris&rsquo; eyes snapped to Seb&rsquo;s, the air between them growing more tense with each second that passed. &ldquo;Few times.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian&rsquo;s stomach flipped. He had another question before it was Chris&rsquo; turn again, so he asked before he could think better of it, &ldquo;Would you ever try it?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Chris answered surprisingly quickly. &ldquo;With the right person.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian was already getting hard in his jeans. Just talking about this with Chris and seeing the look on his face, the open curiosity, the hint of something else&hellip; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How do you&hellip; what do you&hellip;.&rdquo; Chris faltered for a moment, unsure of how to ask his next question. Finally he just decided out with it. &ldquo;You top or bottom?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian&rsquo;s heart skipped a few beats and he knew his face was on fire. &ldquo;Both. But I like bottoming the most.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris&rsquo; brows inches up fractionally and Seb could have sworn he heard him mutter a low <i>fuck</i> under his breath. Then he looked back at Sebastian and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it feel like?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian had to look away to answer, briefly closing his eyes before taking a deep breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s <i>really</i> fucking good. It can be overwhelming. You feel so full and you just&hellip; you feel things you didn&rsquo;t think were even possible. It&rsquo;s addicting.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>It took awhile before Sebastian could bring himself to meet Chris&rsquo; gaze again. When he did he found Chris staring at him, expression maddeningly unreadable. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; Chris murmured. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;re you so curious about me?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris smirked a little bit, the bastard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my reasons.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian wanted to groan and bang his head into the nearest hard surface, but instead he sighed and gestured for Chris to go next. He never could have prepared himself for what came next. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;If I asked you to come here&hellip; and let me try something&hellip; would you?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian&rsquo;s eyes flew to Chris&rsquo; in shock, finding the dark and slightly hungry look on his face and wondering if he&rsquo;d fallen asleep and this was all a drunken dream. But even if it was, he was sure as hell gonna take advantage of it. &ldquo;I&hellip; <i>yeah</i>, fuck.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris then set his beer aside and adjusted a little where he sat, widening his legs a little and giving a tiny, somehow arousing jerk of his head. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mere.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian went to him so fast he would later remember nothing about it, seemingly teleporting himself on to Chris&rsquo; lap before he could so much as draw a breath. He straddled those wonderfully muscular thighs and watched as Chris looked him over, his hands cautiously coming to rest on Sebastian&rsquo;s denim-clad hips. Sebastian wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do with his hands so he held on to the back of the couch with one hand and let the other hang at his sides. </p><p><br /></p><p>Neither of them spoke at first, Chris slowly letting his hands drift up Sebastian&rsquo;s sides. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; Chris muttered appreciatively as he dragged his eyes up Seb&rsquo;s torso, watching his own hands move up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotten so fuckin&rsquo; big.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian shuddered, fairly sure he could come just from Chris&rsquo; innocent touches and his words. &ldquo;Yeah, trying&hellip; tryin&rsquo; to keep up with you,&rdquo; he replied breathlessly. </p><p><br /></p><p>Chris grinned up at him briefly before slowly dragging Sebastian&rsquo;s shirt up, exposing his hard-earned abs. He kept moving the fabric up, up, up until it had nowhere to go but off, and suddenly Sebastian found himself shirtless in Chris&rsquo; lap. </p><p><br /></p><p>Chris leaned back an inch or two to fully take him in, getting braver with his hands as he placed them on Sebastian&rsquo;s stomach and let them feel him, slowly moving upwards. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking gorgeous, Seb. Always thought so.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian made some kind of noise in his throat like the wind had been knocked out of him, his hand on the couch slipping down to grip Chris&rsquo; shoulder. Chris didn&rsquo;t seem to mind, though he was preoccupied with sliding his palms over Sebastian&rsquo;s impressive pecs. &ldquo;<i>Chris</i> -&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Then those hands were on Seb&rsquo;s shoulders, fingers gently and briefly touching the ends of his long hair before trailing down his broad back. Sebastian&rsquo;s skin erupted into flame everywhere Chris touched him, every point of contact going straight to his cock and making him feel like he might burst at any moment. He was sure that he&rsquo;d never been so turned on, and they hadn&rsquo;t even kissed. </p><p><br /></p><p>Chris&rsquo; hands ended up on Sebastian&rsquo;s ass, gripping it through his jeans, and the little gasp that left Sebastian&rsquo;s lips made Chris grin and lean his head forward. Sebastian felt hot breath on his chest and his entire body tensed, cock throbbing in his jeans as Chris squeezed, lips just barely brushing his skin&hellip;</p><p><br /></p><p>Then Chris slid his hands <i>into</i> Sebastian&rsquo;s jeans, gripping his ass hard and pulling him closer, rocking them together through their jeans, and Sebastian moaned because it felt so good and <i>Chris was hard too</i>, but nothing could have prepared him for the sudden flick of a hot tongue on a sensitive nipple. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God, <i>Chris</i>,&rdquo; Sebastian whined, free hand moving to the back of Chris&rsquo; head on instinct, hips moving on their own accord to grind down on Chris&rsquo; lap. Chris replied by wrapping his lips around his nipple and sucking and Sebastian couldn&rsquo;t take it, his entire body feeling like a live wire. </p><p><br /></p><p>Chris pulled away to look up into Sebastian&rsquo;s already-wrecked face, Chris&rsquo; pupils dilated and cheeks flushed and yeah, <i>God</i> he was into this, too. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so hard, Seb&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So are you,&rdquo; Sebastian retorted, voice low and broken-sounding as he rocked in Chris&rsquo; lap, the friction as delicious as it was frustrating. Chris dug his fingers in hard as a reply, and Sebastian moaned and hoped there&rsquo;d be bruises later. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re noisy,&rdquo; Chris noted with delight, pulling one hand free only to press it against the front of Sebastian&rsquo;s jeans, gripping him there experimentally. Sebastian stopped rocking and let another breathless sound leave his throat. &ldquo;Damn. Barely touching you and you&rsquo;re this loud&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian simply whimpered as Chris started rubbing him, letting his head drop forward and almost press against Chris&rsquo; forehead. &ldquo;Chris&hellip; <i>God</i>, Chris -&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris&rsquo; voice was deep and soothing, like something out of Sebastian&rsquo;s fantasies. &ldquo;Yeah, Seb. Tell me what you want.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>He wanted so many fucking things, none of which were going to happen right now because - &ldquo;M&rsquo;gonna come,&rdquo; he whispered, trying to hold back but it just wasn&rsquo;t gonna happen, not when he&rsquo;d been on the edge since the first time Chris&rsquo; hands landed on him. &ldquo;Fuck, Chris, I&rsquo;m -&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just from this?&rdquo; Chris grinned, clearly enjoying his effect upon his friend. &ldquo;This all it takes, baby?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian pressed harder into his hand and gripped Chris&rsquo; hair hard, mouth falling open and body all but singing at being called <i>baby</i> by this man. He chanted Chris&rsquo; name in whispers and Chris tightened his hand and moved it harder, head ducking down to lick across his nipples again and that was it, Sebastian was gone and coming hard in his pants, hard enough to nearly ascend to another plane of existence. </p><p><br /></p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d felt anything so intense. When he was recovered enough to remember where he was, his face was buried in Chris&rsquo; neck and Chris was running soothing fingers up and down Sebastian&rsquo;s back. Sebastian slowly raised his head, meeting Chris&rsquo; still-hungry gaze and expecting to wake up from this dream any second. </p><p><br /></p><p>But instead of waking up, Chris tilted Sebastian&rsquo;s chin up with a single long finger and leaned in to kiss him. It was soft and unexpected and Sebastian melted, exhaling shakily when Chris pulled away and their eyes met again. </p><p><br /></p><p>Chris licked his lips, as if tasting Sebastian on them. &ldquo;I think I like this.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian didn&rsquo;t give himself any time to smile or give some kind of witty reply. Instead he kissed Chris like his life depended on it, having no idea if he&rsquo;d ever get the chance to do this again and wanting to make the most of it while he could. And when Chris responded with a groan and the plunge of his tongue in Sebastian&rsquo;s mouth, Seb knew he&rsquo;d picked the right course of action. </p><p><br /></p><p>They kissed and kissed and kissed, Sebastian not caring one bit about the mess in his pants as he memorized the feel of Chris&rsquo;s lips on his, tongues tangling together and hands drifting all over the place. He wished that it could last forever, more than happy to while away eternity kissing the hell out of Chris Evans in his lap, but he knew that it couldn&rsquo;t and anyway Chris was still rock hard beneath him. And he knew just how he wanted to take him apart. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Off,&rdquo; Sebastian huffed against Chris&rsquo; lips, tugging impatiently at his shirt. They broke apart and Chris all but tore off his shirt, dropping it behind the couch and watching as Sebastian took him in. </p><p><br /></p><p>He&rsquo;d seen Chris shirtless before plenty of times, of course. The whole world had. But  he&rsquo;d never seen him shirtless like this, up close and able to feel that perfect skin beneath his fingertips. He dragged his fingers all over him, through his chest hair and over his nipples, down his ribs and to his abs, and then he ducked down and let his mouth follow. He was gonna taste every inch of Chris that he could, and Chris was happy to let him.</p><p><br /></p><p>Chris ran his fingers through Seb&rsquo;s hair as he made his way down, holding it back so that he could watch Sebastian unimpeded by a curtain of hair over his face. Chris didn&rsquo;t hold back his own sounds as Sebastian tasted him all over, those pouty lips becoming acquainted with Chris&rsquo; body and making him ache in his jeans, the whole thing something he&rsquo;d never known that he&rsquo;d needed until now. But he had no idea what he was in for, not really. </p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian wasted no time in getting Chris&rsquo; jeans undone once he reached them, impatient in getting them and Chris&rsquo; underwear down far enough to free the cock he&rsquo;d spent longer than he&rsquo;d ever admit fantasizing about. Turned out that the real thing was even better, large and so damn hard and like velvet in his hand, leaking and throbbing and the fact that Sebastian was the reason for it&hellip; <i>God</i> he might just be ruined for anyone else after this. </p><p><br /></p><p>On his knees between Chris&rsquo; legs, Sebastian stroked him slow and firm, watching as more pre-come leaked out, and when he leaned in to lick it off Chris made a sound that Sebastian would never forget. Sebastian peeked up at him, maintaining eye contact as he continued to stroke him and lick him, closing his eyes only when he finally wrapped his lips around the tip and moaned like it was the best thing he&rsquo;d ever tasted. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Seb,&rdquo; Chris gasped, fingers tightening in Sebastian&rsquo;s hair as he swallowed him down. Chris watched every bit of it, mouth open and brows furrowed and a blush visible on his cheeks and chest as Sebastian showed off just how good he was at this. And he really was - he took pride in how good he was with his mouth, how he could bring a man to his knees like this and make even the quietest of them beg for more. But he wasn&rsquo;t gonna make Chris beg. All he wanted was to hear his name on Chris&rsquo; lips as he came in his mouth - he&rsquo;d wanted that for so long. </p><p><br /></p><p>He took his time getting there, however, not going too slow nor too fast, wanting this to be perfect for Chris. He looked up as he worked, watching the muscles in Chris&rsquo; torso flex and relax, tightening every time Sebastian did something with his tongue that Chris really liked. Sebastian couldn&rsquo;t help but reach up to touch him with his free hand, running it everywhere he could reach, sometimes playing with a nipple and watching Chris gasp with all the warring sensations. </p><p><br /></p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t long before Chris reached the end of his rope, needing more and not being afraid to demand it. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Seb, faster, harder, baby. You feel so fuckin&rsquo; good, I&rsquo;ve <i>gotta</i> have more, please&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian couldn&rsquo;t have denied him even if he&rsquo;d wanted to. He grabbed Chris&rsquo; hand and placed it back in his hair, and Chris held on tight as Sebastian dove back in and focused on giving Chris everything he wanted. He sucked him off like it was his mission in life, like he wanted nothing more than to see Chris lose it and spill in his mouth, and if that was the truth, well&hellip; nobody could blame him. </p><p><br /></p><p>It was only minutes then when he felt Chris tensing, fingers and abs tightening and breaths coming hard, sweet little sounds leaving his lips getting more and more desperate. Sebastian took him all the way down, deep throating him and showing no mercy, giving him everything he wanted and then some. His only warning was a rush of deep, breathy <i>Seb, Seb, God baby</i> and then Chris was coming and coming and Sebastian was happy to utterly drown in him. </p><p><br /></p><p>He swallowed every drop and was careful to clean Chris up the best that he could, tucking him back into his pants as Chris laid boneless and panting on the couch. Sebastian grinned at the debauched sight that he made, taking a mental picture before climbing up back into Chris&rsquo; lap and kissing the corner of his mouth softly. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That fuckin&rsquo; mouth of yours,&rdquo; Chris groaned, eyes still closed but his arms wrapping loosely around his friend and maybe lover. &ldquo;My God.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian grinned with pride and nuzzled his jaw. &ldquo;Glad you liked it.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I loved it,&rdquo; Chris replied, opening his eyes and meeting Sebastian&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;I loved it all.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Sebastian murmured, blushing a little. </p><p><br /></p><p>They stayed there like that, still basking in the afterglow and the unexpected bliss of it all, until Chris sighed and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty late.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Sebastian stiffened, thinking that Chris was going to gently show him the door now. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah. I should g-&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stay over?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>They spoke the words at the same time, then smiled and chuckled together as Sebastian exhaled with relief. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; he replied, leaning in and brushing a kiss across Chris&rsquo; lips. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Chris murmured with a faint grin, &ldquo;because I haven&rsquo;t decided if I&rsquo;m done with you yet.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><i>God</i> Sebastian hoped he wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAidATIEpHEyeBI44BIGmZg\">@captainrogerrsbeard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md7eywmAnCn-B194usnbb0g\">@take-me-tom-hiddleston</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mF4C3vOwxZjEWzQJ3tQMjCw\">@supersmuttyqueernerd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muzaTi-rD3DLEuZf2J_eykQ\">@stanclub</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcYT6_R0xPDdJM1tM8shgdg\">@buckysbrat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msRbKovV7RdgRgAhW2eVEOA\">@freshwoods</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJFoEDHp53CswU_ZHWCm1qA\">@ravensonata</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJxgalB5nL0TlWqrSNHemqA\">@lisamott9</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwhx6YCBRC0o8pVLu-XlDRQ\">@onehotgreasymechanic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNmpNeF1IEvFJtdv3jBcRxQ\">@musette22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqR7L2ZIFzB7SrwVS7x8COw\">@riricitaa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3ba3CVEdGlg7Ecpb1Hu2Aw\">@wildestdreamsimpossiblethings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzuqLDD_cI7b62ljq4uB-_g\">@time-travel-bouqet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miOmMdBBsBXQDxINdiEuFgA\">@the-wayward-robot</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkp4VvoKIpsrDxZYOAcilNQ\">@wintersoldier1989</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meWnmsuwyDZnhglX6ucOlZA\">@nade2308</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JaOhLc7o7BDEgZtGxYWiQ\">@loricameback</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFt6Kcxr-Uk-Gf_1q_OU1Dw\">@book-dragon-13</a> </p>",

This is just some good ol&rsquo; fashioned Evanstan smut that I felt like writing today &#128514; hope you guys like it sjjsjsjs</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&mdash;</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>It was late as hell and Sebastian was drunk, drunk enough to make some extremely questionable decisions and not give a single fuck as to whether he&rsquo;d regret it in the morning. It explained why he was still in Chris&rsquo; hotel room long after the others had left, still playing Truth or Dare with Chris way after all the others had bowed out, sitting next to him on a small leather couch with their knees pressed casually together. He might die before the night was over but he really couldn&rsquo;t think of a better way to go. </p>\n\n</p>",
