He spared a glance at TJ, who was thankfully too far away to hear what they were saying, then turned back to Buffy with a drawn-out sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s been some new developments.\u201d</p><p>Buffy squeezed his arm tighter. \u201cDevelopments? <i>What </i>developments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 Let\u2019s just say you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s been texting a special someone over the summer\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s been confirmed yet, but\u2026 <i>yeah</i>. Hopefully.\u201d</p><p>Buffy blinked at him in silence for a moment. If he strained his ears, he could almost hear the gears turning slowly in her head. After a full minute had passed, he was pretty sure he\u2019d broken his best friend, but then she suddenly sat upright and shook herself out of her daze.</p><p>\u201cWow. Okay. Just had to let that sink in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s probably weird for you, but I really like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about TJ? How does he feel about you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned down at the table. \u201cI think he likes me too. At least, that\u2019s what he\u2019s said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Over text, but still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had a chance to talk in person since you got back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why am I still sitting here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go!\u201d</p><p>Buffy grabbed her purse and slipped out of her seat, giving Cyrus a friendly clap on the back as she headed for the door. \u201cYou guys need to talk,\u201d she gently instructed. \u201cCall me once you\u2019ve figured things out.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus watched her leave with a grateful smile and a pounding heart. He almost jumped out of his skin when TJ sat in the now-empty seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Did I give you another \u2018good scare\u2019?\u201d he asked, imitating his English accent with a teasing smirk. \u201cWhere did Buffy go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2026 had to run an errand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind it just being the two of us?\u201d</p><p>TJ huffed a laugh. \u201cAre you serious? You know I\u2019ve been wanting to get you alone ever since you came back from London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d Cyrus twisted his hands together, his lips twitching with a bashful smile. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019d like that. To talk, I mean. About everything.\u201d</p><p>TJ separated his restless hands with one of his own, effortlessly threading their fingers together. When their palms connected, Cyrus felt a thrill running down his spine, like a spark of electricity lighting his body on fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna hear the English accent again.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned. \u201cYou got it, mate.\u201d</p>",

He fixed his ascot and sat up straight, wiggling his eyebrows in a gracefully offended fashion. \u201cEasy there, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m only speakin\u2019 the ways of my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re American!

It\u2019s excruciating.\u201d</p><p>To Cyrus\u2019 surprise \u2013 <i>and</i> Buffy\u2019s, judging by the frown creasing her brow \u2013 TJ simply chuckled and ruffled Cyrus\u2019 hair. His large hands ruined his perfectly-gelled \u2018do\u2019 within seconds, but Cyrus couldn\u2019t find it in himself to care.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d TJ said sweetly.</p><p>Buffy scoffed. \u201cAre you seriously encouraging this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, leave the guy alone. He\u2019s having a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my ears are close to bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s kinda cute,\u201d TJ admitted with a shrug, his hand dropping from Cyrus\u2019 hair to his face. He gave his left cheek a playful pinch and smiled, his eyes twinkling. \u201cI dig a man with an accent.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed. \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019ll treat you to the <i>Spanish</i> accent next year.\u201d</p><p>TJ bit his lip in a way that could only be interpreted as flirtatious. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>While TJ was busy placing his own order \u2013 plus an extra basket of baby taters for Cyrus \u2013 Buffy managed to close her gaping mouth and grabbed Cyrus by the arm, dragging him forward across the table until their faces were practically touching.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Cyrus swallowed the urge to speak in an English accent again. \u201cWhat was what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me, Cyrus!

Because I won\u2019t hesitate \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Cyrus lifted his hands in surrender. He spared a glance at TJ, who was thankfully too far away to hear what they were saying, then turned back to Buffy with a drawn-out sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s been some new developments.\u201d</p><p>Buffy squeezed his arm tighter. \u201cDevelopments? <i>What </i>developments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 Let\u2019s just say you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s been texting a special someone over the summer\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s been confirmed yet, but\u2026 <i>yeah</i>. Hopefully.\u201d</p><p>Buffy blinked at him in silence for a moment. If he strained his ears, he could almost hear the gears turning slowly in her head. After a full minute had passed, he was pretty sure he\u2019d broken his best friend, but then she suddenly sat upright and shook herself out of her daze.</p><p>\u201cWow. Okay. Just had to let that sink in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s probably weird for you, but I really like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about TJ?
