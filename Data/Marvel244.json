Enjoy! \ud83d\udc95</p><p><br/></p><!-- more --><hr><p><br/></p><p>You\nhadn\u2019t even pulled out your keys when the door was opened for you.\nOf course, it was none other than Jarvis having waited for you, and\nhe greeted you with a slight bow, concern etched into his features.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s\nTony?\u201d you asked, impatiently shrugging out of your jacket and\nkicking off your shoes. This time Jarvis didn\u2019t comment on how they\nweren\u2019t neatly stacked next to the other pairs, didn\u2019t even\nlifted his right eyebrow as he always did when you threw your\nbackpack into the next available spot. He just took your hand,\nsqueezed it to make clear he was there for you, sensing - as the\nfantastic parental figure he always had been - that you were too\nthrown off even for a hug.</p><p>\u201cSir\nis in his personal laboratory,\u201d Jarvis answered, \u201che is waiting\nfor your arrival.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, shortly touching Jarvis\u2019s lower arm as a quick thank you,\nbefore you hurried down the stairs and to Tony\u2019s lab.</p><p>DUM-E,\nTony\u2019s first robot project at MIT, greeted you with a series of\ndistressed beeps, nudging at your hand with his claw, then turning to\nhis creator. You absently patted him, trying to calm him down, but\nDUM-E never lived up to his name when it came to sensing yours or\nTony\u2019s mood. He was like a puppy, clumsy and inexperienced when it\ncame to most things, but he made it up with enthusiasm and never\nending spirit of always wanting to do his best for his favorite\nhumans.</p><p>As\nmuch as you loved and appreciated him for it, though, you really\nweren\u2019t able to let his comfort through right now.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\ntell me this is a sick joke of yours.\u201d</p><p>The\nlook on Tony\u2019s face when he turned to you told you that it was\neverything but. A desperate sound left your lips, and you moved over\nto Tony and the holograms he already had pulled up.</p><p>You\nweren\u2019t the CEO of Stark Industries and you had never planned on\nbecoming it. You didn\u2019t understand much of business, and you never\nwere and you never would be interested in it. The perks of the world\nnot knowing you were a Stark came with nobody expecting anything of\nyou. Your mother had done anything to be able to raise you without\nany paparazzi documenting every step you would take, so you learned\nto introduce yourself as a Carbonell, not a Stark, and while the\nworld knew the famous Tony Stark had a sister, they never had gotten\na name or a picture, and soon had lost interest in something they\ncouldn\u2019t present the world like a new toy.</p><p>However,\nback to the point: you didn\u2019t even want to understand half of the\nshit Tony was showing you, but Tony knew you would understand what he\nwanted you to understand.</p><p>He\neven marked the illegal transitions of weapons red.</p><p>\u201cI\ncannot believe it,\u201d you whispered, stepping closer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re\nsure it is \u2026?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded, manipulating the hologram with a few flicks of his wrist and\nwagging fingers. \u201cThe A.I. I had begun to program did an amazing\njob at its first quest. Really, it is a mere coincidence I decided\nfor it to check SI\u2019s latest transactions. It was all found on his\ncomputer.\u201d</p><p>You\nlooked at your brother, and even though he had the carefully blank\nmedia mask on, you knew deep down he was hurting at this betrayal.\nMaybe, no, surely even more than you, but he refused to let it show.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare we gonna do now?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nsighed heavily, rubbed a hand across his forehead. You stepped closer\nand he immediately laid his arm around your shoulders, seeking\ncontact.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsue him, of course. I am not going to sit by while this man sells <i>my</i>\nweapons to terrorists. I don\u2019t need \u2026 I don\u2019t need that on my\nconscience.\u201d</p><p>His\nlower lip was wobbling, even though Tony tried his best to cease the\ntrembling.</p><p>\u201cYou\nremember those reports of terrorists kidnapping children, and killing\ntheir parents, and who knows what else they do?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice\nbroke at the end. \u201cI-It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips turned down fully at this. You hated seeing your\nbrother like this. His voice never broke. He never looked desperate\nor lost. He never had tears gathering in his eyes.</p><p>You\nnever had been your godfather\u2019s favorite, and the feeling was\nmutual, but there never had been a moment before where you hated\nObadiah Stane more than now.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nyou said, voice stern. \u201cDon\u2019t you start this shit. If it is\nsomeone\u2019s fault, it is his.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nfinally turned to you, blurring gaze trained on you. This was more\nthan Tony feeling guilty over the deaths caused by his weapons. It\nwas the betrayal of his godfather, someone he trusted, regardless of\nyour dislike of him; after all, Obie had been the only father figure\nbesides Jarvis who told Tony he was proud of him and his work.</p><p>The\nrelationship between you and Obie always was difficult. Just like\nyour father, he had more interest in Tony, and he rarely bothered to\nhide the fact. After your parents\u2019 death, he made sure that Tony\ngot CEO and back to work as quickly as he could, offering him every\nhelp he might need.</p><p>Now,\nit was no wonder why he\u2019d been so eager on getting Tony back on\ntrack as soon as possible.</p><p>You\ngot angry, but before you had time to dwell on it, Tony sniffed and\naggressively wiped over his closed lids with his finger tips.</p><p>\u201cW-We\nneed to contact our lawyers. We need to do a press conference. We\nneed to collect more proof. Restrict his access to our data bank and\nstores. Freeze his whole Stark Industries account, we -\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>His\nwords got stuck in his throat, more tears had gathered in his eyes.\nIt made you even more angry. Looking grimly, you let Tony sag into\nyour side, wrapping your arms around him to let him hide. Barely\nthere sobs rattled his body.</p><p>Tony\nnever cried.</p><p>You\nhated it.</p><p>A\nfew angry tears rolled down your own face.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Peter\nhad a huge grin on his face, sitting next to you in his car seat as\nthe front-seat passenger.</p><p>Once\nin a while, you would take Peter with you instead of watching him at\nMay\u2019s, and today was \u2018once in a while.\u2019 The little peanut\nnearly ran into the door in excitement when you told him he would\ncome with you. The prospect of finally seeing Tony again, had put him\ninto a great mood - and you hadn\u2019t have the heart to tell him, yet,\nthat he only would see Tony maybe five minutes tops.</p><p>As\nPeter had been hurriedly packing his little backpack (he came three\ntimes out of his room, exclaiming loudly that you could go now, only\nto be asked by you or May if he had thought of his little toothbrush,\na fresh pair of socks, or his water bottle he always brought to\nkindergarten,) May and Ben had sat down with you in the kitchen and\nasked how you and Tony were doing.</p><p>You\nwanted to say that you were fine, and Tony as well, but they had seen\nthe news report and knew what happened. May also happened to know\nthat Tony had always trusted and valued Obie. So, she had given you a\nstern look, and you had sighed, words now falling out of your mouth\nlike a waterfall.</p><p>The\nstress Tony was in caused by the search for more proof of Obadiah\u2019s\nbetrayal and then the following trial, and in turn how it stressed\nyou out to see your brother in so much work, he was practically\ndrowning. Not that he couldn\u2019t handle a full schedule, it was\nalways made sure of he someday knew how to run a business and that\nincluded packed days. No, it was more the reason of his now packed\nschedule why he didn\u2019t fare well.</p><p>It\npained you, that there didn\u2019t seem anything you could do.</p><p>Though,\nBen and May were quick to reassure you, that your sheer presence and\nmental support were an important thing to keep Tony going.</p><p>You\nsure hoped they were right, as you had nothing else to offer.</p><p>When\nyou and Peter left, they both hugged you tight, wishing you and Tony\nstrength.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nalways here for you,\u201d Ben had said, and you really had felt a tiny\nbit better after that.</p><p>And\nwith Peter around, one was just <i>bound</i> to feel better! How\ncould you not? That little ray of sunshine made you instantly feel\nbetter, and you hoped so much he had the same effect on Tony.</p><p>Additionally,\nPeter was just so excited to see Tony. It would break his heart if he\ndidn\u2019t get to see him even for a few minutes.</p><p>Peter\nwas already out the car and up the stairs to the front door before\nyou had exited the car yourself and got out his backpack. Jarvis must\nhave seen you two arriving because only a few seconds later the door\nwas opened and Peter hugged the butler\u2019s leg in greeting.</p><p>\u201cGood\nafternoon to you, too, young Mr. Parker,\u201d Jarvis, polite as ever,\ngreeted back, nodding to you with a calm \u201cMiss Y/N\u201d when you\nentered the building as well.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nJarvis,\u201d you said, helping Peter out of his shoes and jacket. \u201cYou\nknow where Tony is? The peanut wants to see him.\u201d</p><p>Peter\nnodded frantically as he watched Jarvis put away his clothes.</p><p>\u201cSir\nis currently in a meeting with a lawyer, I am afraid.\u201d</p><p>You\nsighed, one hand gliding over Peter\u2019s hair, whose owner was\npouting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, peanut, but I am sure we can at least eat\ndinner with him in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Jarvis\nnodded. \u201cI will arrange everything to your liking, Miss Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Smiling,\nyou thanked Jarvis.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/><br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Since\nthe reveal of illegal weapon transactions of Stark Industries, former\ninterim CEO Obadiah Stane is to appear in court. Accused by the\ncurrent CEO Tony Stark, Stane is believed to be working with a\nterrorist organization called the Ten Rings.</i></p><p><i>Read\nmore about this and see exclusive pictures on page 16.\u201d</i></p><p>Before\nBucky had been able to open the magazine to page sixteen, Steve had\nripped it out of his hands, tossing it to Sam. Bucky frowned at his\nfriend.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nreally don\u2019t want to read that,\u201d Sam said, looking at him\nintently.</p><p>\u201cAgain:\nwhy?\u201d</p><p>Sam\nshifted his gaze to Steve, whose corner of the mouth turned down. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter if I like it. \u2018Sides, it\u2019s an article about\nsomeone selling the best weapons to date to some frickin\u2019 terrorist\norganization, nobody likes it.\u201d</p><p>To\nBucky\u2019s benefit, Sam was still staring at Steve, realizing too late\nthat Bucky was going for the magazine. Sam jumped out of his seat as\nsoon as Bucky had snatched the paper, racing after him, but Bucky\nalready bounced into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.\nHurriedly, he opened the magazine on page sixteen.</p><p>\u201c<i>The\nTen Rings is a terrorists organization hellbent on destroying world\npeace by any means necessary.

This time Jarvis didn\u2019t comment on how they\nweren\u2019t neatly stacked next to the other pairs, didn\u2019t even\nlifted his right eyebrow as he always did when you threw your\nbackpack into the next available spot. He just took your hand,\nsqueezed it to make clear he was there for you, sensing - as the\nfantastic parental figure he always had been - that you were too\nthrown off even for a hug.</p><p>\u201cSir\nis in his personal laboratory,\u201d Jarvis answered, \u201che is waiting\nfor your arrival.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, shortly touching Jarvis\u2019s lower arm as a quick thank you,\nbefore you hurried down the stairs and to Tony\u2019s lab.</p><p>DUM-E,\nTony\u2019s first robot project at MIT, greeted you with a series of\ndistressed beeps, nudging at your hand with his claw, then turning to\nhis creator. You absently patted him, trying to calm him down, but\nDUM-E never lived up to his name when it came to sensing yours or\nTony\u2019s mood. He was like a puppy, clumsy and inexperienced when it\ncame to most things, but he made it up with enthusiasm and never\nending spirit of always wanting to do his best for his favorite\nhumans.</p><p>As\nmuch as you loved and appreciated him for it, though, you really\nweren\u2019t able to let his comfort through right now.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\ntell me this is a sick joke of yours.\u201d</p><p>The\nlook on Tony\u2019s face when he turned to you told you that it was\neverything but. A desperate sound left your lips, and you moved over\nto Tony and the holograms he already had pulled up.</p><p>You\nweren\u2019t the CEO of Stark Industries and you had never planned on\nbecoming it. You didn\u2019t understand much of business, and you never\nwere and you never would be interested in it. The perks of the world\nnot knowing you were a Stark came with nobody expecting anything of\nyou. Your mother had done anything to be able to raise you without\nany paparazzi documenting every step you would take, so you learned\nto introduce yourself as a Carbonell, not a Stark, and while the\nworld knew the famous Tony Stark had a sister, they never had gotten\na name or a picture, and soon had lost interest in something they\ncouldn\u2019t present the world like a new toy.</p><p>However,\nback to the point: you didn\u2019t even want to understand half of the\nshit Tony was showing you, but Tony knew you would understand what he\nwanted you to understand.</p><p>He\neven marked the illegal transitions of weapons red.</p><p>\u201cI\ncannot believe it,\u201d you whispered, stepping closer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re\nsure it is \u2026?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded, manipulating the hologram with a few flicks of his wrist and\nwagging fingers. \u201cThe A.I. I had begun to program did an amazing\njob at its first quest. Really, it is a mere coincidence I decided\nfor it to check SI\u2019s latest transactions. It was all found on his\ncomputer.\u201d</p><p>You\nlooked at your brother, and even though he had the carefully blank\nmedia mask on, you knew deep down he was hurting at this betrayal.\nMaybe, no, surely even more than you, but he refused to let it show.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare we gonna do now?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nsighed heavily, rubbed a hand across his forehead. You stepped closer\nand he immediately laid his arm around your shoulders, seeking\ncontact.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsue him, of course. I am not going to sit by while this man sells <i>my</i>\nweapons to terrorists. I don\u2019t need \u2026 I don\u2019t need that on my\nconscience.\u201d</p><p>His\nlower lip was wobbling, even though Tony tried his best to cease the\ntrembling.</p><p>\u201cYou\nremember those reports of terrorists kidnapping children, and killing\ntheir parents, and who knows what else they do?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice\nbroke at the end. \u201cI-It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips turned down fully at this. You hated seeing your\nbrother like this. His voice never broke. He never looked desperate\nor lost. He never had tears gathering in his eyes.</p><p>You\nnever had been your godfather\u2019s favorite, and the feeling was\nmutual, but there never had been a moment before where you hated\nObadiah Stane more than now.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nyou said, voice stern. \u201cDon\u2019t you start this shit. If it is\nsomeone\u2019s fault, it is his.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nfinally turned to you, blurring gaze trained on you. This was more\nthan Tony feeling guilty over the deaths caused by his weapons. It\nwas the betrayal of his godfather, someone he trusted, regardless of\nyour dislike of him; after all, Obie had been the only father figure\nbesides Jarvis who told Tony he was proud of him and his work.</p><p>The\nrelationship between you and Obie always was difficult. Just like\nyour father, he had more interest in Tony, and he rarely bothered to\nhide the fact. After your parents\u2019 death, he made sure that Tony\ngot CEO and back to work as quickly as he could, offering him every\nhelp he might need.</p><p>Now,\nit was no wonder why he\u2019d been so eager on getting Tony back on\ntrack as soon as possible.</p><p>You\ngot angry, but before you had time to dwell on it, Tony sniffed and\naggressively wiped over his closed lids with his finger tips.</p><p>\u201cW-We\nneed to contact our lawyers. We need to do a press conference. We\nneed to collect more proof. Restrict his access to our data bank and\nstores. Freeze his whole Stark Industries account, we -\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>His\nwords got stuck in his throat, more tears had gathered in his eyes.\nIt made you even more angry. Looking grimly, you let Tony sag into\nyour side, wrapping your arms around him to let him hide. Barely\nthere sobs rattled his body.</p><p>Tony\nnever cried.</p><p>You\nhated it.</p><p>A\nfew angry tears rolled down your own face.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Peter\nhad a huge grin on his face, sitting next to you in his car seat as\nthe front-seat passenger.</p><p>Once\nin a while, you would take Peter with you instead of watching him at\nMay\u2019s, and today was \u2018once in a while.\u2019 The little peanut\nnearly ran into the door in excitement when you told him he would\ncome with you. The prospect of finally seeing Tony again, had put him\ninto a great mood - and you hadn\u2019t have the heart to tell him, yet,\nthat he only would see Tony maybe five minutes tops.</p><p>As\nPeter had been hurriedly packing his little backpack (he came three\ntimes out of his room, exclaiming loudly that you could go now, only\nto be asked by you or May if he had thought of his little toothbrush,\na fresh pair of socks, or his water bottle he always brought to\nkindergarten,) May and Ben had sat down with you in the kitchen and\nasked how you and Tony were doing.</p><p>You\nwanted to say that you were fine, and Tony as well, but they had seen\nthe news report and knew what happened. May also happened to know\nthat Tony had always trusted and valued Obie. So, she had given you a\nstern look, and you had sighed, words now falling out of your mouth\nlike a waterfall.</p><p>The\nstress Tony was in caused by the search for more proof of Obadiah\u2019s\nbetrayal and then the following trial, and in turn how it stressed\nyou out to see your brother in so much work, he was practically\ndrowning. Not that he couldn\u2019t handle a full schedule, it was\nalways made sure of he someday knew how to run a business and that\nincluded packed days. No, it was more the reason of his now packed\nschedule why he didn\u2019t fare well.</p><p>It\npained you, that there didn\u2019t seem anything you could do.</p><p>Though,\nBen and May were quick to reassure you, that your sheer presence and\nmental support were an important thing to keep Tony going.</p><p>You\nsure hoped they were right, as you had nothing else to offer.</p><p>When\nyou and Peter left, they both hugged you tight, wishing you and Tony\nstrength.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nalways here for you,\u201d Ben had said, and you really had felt a tiny\nbit better after that.</p><p>And\nwith Peter around, one was just <i>bound</i> to feel better! How\ncould you not? That little ray of sunshine made you instantly feel\nbetter, and you hoped so much he had the same effect on Tony.</p><p>Additionally,\nPeter was just so excited to see Tony. It would break his heart if he\ndidn\u2019t get to see him even for a few minutes.</p><p>Peter\nwas already out the car and up the stairs to the front door before\nyou had exited the car yourself and got out his backpack. Jarvis must\nhave seen you two arriving because only a few seconds later the door\nwas opened and Peter hugged the butler\u2019s leg in greeting.</p><p>\u201cGood\nafternoon to you, too, young Mr. Parker,\u201d Jarvis, polite as ever,\ngreeted back, nodding to you with a calm \u201cMiss Y/N\u201d when you\nentered the building as well.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nJarvis,\u201d you said, helping Peter out of his shoes and jacket. \u201cYou\nknow where Tony is? The peanut wants to see him.\u201d</p><p>Peter\nnodded frantically as he watched Jarvis put away his clothes.</p><p>\u201cSir\nis currently in a meeting with a lawyer, I am afraid.\u201d</p><p>You\nsighed, one hand gliding over Peter\u2019s hair, whose owner was\npouting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, peanut, but I am sure we can at least eat\ndinner with him in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Jarvis\nnodded. \u201cI will arrange everything to your liking, Miss Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Smiling,\nyou thanked Jarvis.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Since\nthe reveal of illegal weapon transactions of Stark Industries, former\ninterim CEO Obadiah Stane is to appear in court. Accused by the\ncurrent CEO Tony Stark, Stane is believed to be working with a\nterrorist organization called the Ten Rings.</i></p><p><i>Read\nmore about this and see exclusive pictures on page 16.\u201d</i></p><p>Before\nBucky had been able to open the magazine to page sixteen, Steve had\nripped it out of his hands, tossing it to Sam. Bucky frowned at his\nfriend.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nreally don\u2019t want to read that,\u201d Sam said, looking at him\nintently.</p><p>\u201cAgain:\nwhy?\u201d</p><p>Sam\nshifted his gaze to Steve, whose corner of the mouth turned down. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter if I like it. \u2018Sides, it\u2019s an article about\nsomeone selling the best weapons to date to some frickin\u2019 terrorist\norganization, nobody likes it.\u201d</p><p>To\nBucky\u2019s benefit, Sam was still staring at Steve, realizing too late\nthat Bucky was going for the magazine. Sam jumped out of his seat as\nsoon as Bucky had snatched the paper, racing after him, but Bucky\nalready bounced into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.\nHurriedly, he opened the magazine on page sixteen.</p><p>\u201c<i>The\nTen Rings is a terrorists organization hellbent on destroying world\npeace by any means necessary.

This time Jarvis didn\u2019t comment on how they\nweren\u2019t neatly stacked next to the other pairs, didn\u2019t even\nlifted his right eyebrow as he always did when you threw your\nbackpack into the next available spot. He just took your hand,\nsqueezed it to make clear he was there for you, sensing - as the\nfantastic parental figure he always had been - that you were too\nthrown off even for a hug.</p><p>\u201cSir\nis in his personal laboratory,\u201d Jarvis answered, \u201che is waiting\nfor your arrival.\u201d</p><p>You\nnodded, shortly touching Jarvis\u2019s lower arm as a quick thank you,\nbefore you hurried down the stairs and to Tony\u2019s lab.</p><p>DUM-E,\nTony\u2019s first robot project at MIT, greeted you with a series of\ndistressed beeps, nudging at your hand with his claw, then turning to\nhis creator. You absently patted him, trying to calm him down, but\nDUM-E never lived up to his name when it came to sensing yours or\nTony\u2019s mood. He was like a puppy, clumsy and inexperienced when it\ncame to most things, but he made it up with enthusiasm and never\nending spirit of always wanting to do his best for his favorite\nhumans.</p><p>As\nmuch as you loved and appreciated him for it, though, you really\nweren\u2019t able to let his comfort through right now.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\ntell me this is a sick joke of yours.\u201d</p><p>The\nlook on Tony\u2019s face when he turned to you told you that it was\neverything but. A desperate sound left your lips, and you moved over\nto Tony and the holograms he already had pulled up.</p><p>You\nweren\u2019t the CEO of Stark Industries and you had never planned on\nbecoming it. You didn\u2019t understand much of business, and you never\nwere and you never would be interested in it. The perks of the world\nnot knowing you were a Stark came with nobody expecting anything of\nyou. Your mother had done anything to be able to raise you without\nany paparazzi documenting every step you would take, so you learned\nto introduce yourself as a Carbonell, not a Stark, and while the\nworld knew the famous Tony Stark had a sister, they never had gotten\na name or a picture, and soon had lost interest in something they\ncouldn\u2019t present the world like a new toy.</p><p>However,\nback to the point: you didn\u2019t even want to understand half of the\nshit Tony was showing you, but Tony knew you would understand what he\nwanted you to understand.</p><p>He\neven marked the illegal transitions of weapons red.</p><p>\u201cI\ncannot believe it,\u201d you whispered, stepping closer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re\nsure it is \u2026?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nnodded, manipulating the hologram with a few flicks of his wrist and\nwagging fingers. \u201cThe A.I. I had begun to program did an amazing\njob at its first quest. Really, it is a mere coincidence I decided\nfor it to check SI\u2019s latest transactions. It was all found on his\ncomputer.\u201d</p><p>You\nlooked at your brother, and even though he had the carefully blank\nmedia mask on, you knew deep down he was hurting at this betrayal.\nMaybe, no, surely even more than you, but he refused to let it show.</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare we gonna do now?\u201d</p><p>Tony\nsighed heavily, rubbed a hand across his forehead. You stepped closer\nand he immediately laid his arm around your shoulders, seeking\ncontact.</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsue him, of course. I am not going to sit by while this man sells <i>my</i>\nweapons to terrorists. I don\u2019t need \u2026 I don\u2019t need that on my\nconscience.\u201d</p><p>His\nlower lip was wobbling, even though Tony tried his best to cease the\ntrembling.</p><p>\u201cYou\nremember those reports of terrorists kidnapping children, and killing\ntheir parents, and who knows what else they do?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice\nbroke at the end. \u201cI-It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips turned down fully at this. You hated seeing your\nbrother like this. His voice never broke. He never looked desperate\nor lost. He never had tears gathering in his eyes.</p><p>You\nnever had been your godfather\u2019s favorite, and the feeling was\nmutual, but there never had been a moment before where you hated\nObadiah Stane more than now.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nyou said, voice stern. \u201cDon\u2019t you start this shit. If it is\nsomeone\u2019s fault, it is his.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nfinally turned to you, blurring gaze trained on you. This was more\nthan Tony feeling guilty over the deaths caused by his weapons. It\nwas the betrayal of his godfather, someone he trusted, regardless of\nyour dislike of him; after all, Obie had been the only father figure\nbesides Jarvis who told Tony he was proud of him and his work.</p><p>The\nrelationship between you and Obie always was difficult. Just like\nyour father, he had more interest in Tony, and he rarely bothered to\nhide the fact. After your parents\u2019 death, he made sure that Tony\ngot CEO and back to work as quickly as he could, offering him every\nhelp he might need.</p><p>Now,\nit was no wonder why he\u2019d been so eager on getting Tony back on\ntrack as soon as possible.</p><p>You\ngot angry, but before you had time to dwell on it, Tony sniffed and\naggressively wiped over his closed lids with his finger tips.</p><p>\u201cW-We\nneed to contact our lawyers. We need to do a press conference. We\nneed to collect more proof. Restrict his access to our data bank and\nstores. Freeze his whole Stark Industries account, we -\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>His\nwords got stuck in his throat, more tears had gathered in his eyes.\nIt made you even more angry. Looking grimly, you let Tony sag into\nyour side, wrapping your arms around him to let him hide. Barely\nthere sobs rattled his body.</p><p>Tony\nnever cried.</p><p>You\nhated it.</p><p>A\nfew angry tears rolled down your own face.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Peter\nhad a huge grin on his face, sitting next to you in his car seat as\nthe front-seat passenger.</p><p>Once\nin a while, you would take Peter with you instead of watching him at\nMay\u2019s, and today was \u2018once in a while.\u2019 The little peanut\nnearly ran into the door in excitement when you told him he would\ncome with you. The prospect of finally seeing Tony again, had put him\ninto a great mood - and you hadn\u2019t have the heart to tell him, yet,\nthat he only would see Tony maybe five minutes tops.</p><p>As\nPeter had been hurriedly packing his little backpack (he came three\ntimes out of his room, exclaiming loudly that you could go now, only\nto be asked by you or May if he had thought of his little toothbrush,\na fresh pair of socks, or his water bottle he always brought to\nkindergarten,) May and Ben had sat down with you in the kitchen and\nasked how you and Tony were doing.</p><p>You\nwanted to say that you were fine, and Tony as well, but they had seen\nthe news report and knew what happened. May also happened to know\nthat Tony had always trusted and valued Obie. So, she had given you a\nstern look, and you had sighed, words now falling out of your mouth\nlike a waterfall.</p><p>The\nstress Tony was in caused by the search for more proof of Obadiah\u2019s\nbetrayal and then the following trial, and in turn how it stressed\nyou out to see your brother in so much work, he was practically\ndrowning. Not that he couldn\u2019t handle a full schedule, it was\nalways made sure of he someday knew how to run a business and that\nincluded packed days. No, it was more the reason of his now packed\nschedule why he didn\u2019t fare well.</p><p>It\npained you, that there didn\u2019t seem anything you could do.</p><p>Though,\nBen and May were quick to reassure you, that your sheer presence and\nmental support were an important thing to keep Tony going.</p><p>You\nsure hoped they were right, as you had nothing else to offer.</p><p>When\nyou and Peter left, they both hugged you tight, wishing you and Tony\nstrength.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nalways here for you,\u201d Ben had said, and you really had felt a tiny\nbit better after that.</p><p>And\nwith Peter around, one was just <i>bound</i> to feel better! How\ncould you not? That little ray of sunshine made you instantly feel\nbetter, and you hoped so much he had the same effect on Tony.</p><p>Additionally,\nPeter was just so excited to see Tony. It would break his heart if he\ndidn\u2019t get to see him even for a few minutes.</p><p>Peter\nwas already out the car and up the stairs to the front door before\nyou had exited the car yourself and got out his backpack. Jarvis must\nhave seen you two arriving because only a few seconds later the door\nwas opened and Peter hugged the butler\u2019s leg in greeting.</p><p>\u201cGood\nafternoon to you, too, young Mr. Parker,\u201d Jarvis, polite as ever,\ngreeted back, nodding to you with a calm \u201cMiss Y/N\u201d when you\nentered the building as well.</p><p>\u201cHey,\nJarvis,\u201d you said, helping Peter out of his shoes and jacket. \u201cYou\nknow where Tony is? The peanut wants to see him.\u201d</p><p>Peter\nnodded frantically as he watched Jarvis put away his clothes.</p><p>\u201cSir\nis currently in a meeting with a lawyer, I am afraid.\u201d</p><p>You\nsighed, one hand gliding over Peter\u2019s hair, whose owner was\npouting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, peanut, but I am sure we can at least eat\ndinner with him in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Jarvis\nnodded. \u201cI will arrange everything to your liking, Miss Y/N.\u201d</p><p>Smiling,\nyou thanked Jarvis.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br><br></p><p>\u201c<i>Since\nthe reveal of illegal weapon transactions of Stark Industries, former\ninterim CEO Obadiah Stane is to appear in court. Accused by the\ncurrent CEO Tony Stark, Stane is believed to be working with a\nterrorist organization called the Ten Rings.</i></p><p><i>Read\nmore about this and see exclusive pictures on page 16.\u201d</i></p><p>Before\nBucky had been able to open the magazine to page sixteen, Steve had\nripped it out of his hands, tossing it to Sam.

Enjoy! &#128149;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You\nhadn&rsquo;t even pulled out your keys when the door was opened for you.\nOf course, it was none other than Jarvis having waited for you, and\nhe greeted you with a slight bow, concern etched into his features.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s\nTony?&rdquo; you asked, impatiently shrugging out of your jacket and\nkicking off your shoes. This time Jarvis didn&rsquo;t comment on how they\nweren&rsquo;t neatly stacked next to the other pairs, didn&rsquo;t even\nlifted his right eyebrow as he always did when you threw your\nbackpack into the next available spot. He just took your hand,\nsqueezed it to make clear he was there for you, sensing - as the\nfantastic parental figure he always had been - that you were too\nthrown off even for a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir\nis in his personal laboratory,&rdquo; Jarvis answered, &ldquo;he is waiting\nfor your arrival.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nnodded, shortly touching Jarvis&rsquo;s lower arm as a quick thank you,\nbefore you hurried down the stairs and to Tony&rsquo;s lab.</p><p>DUM-E,\nTony&rsquo;s first robot project at MIT, greeted you with a series of\ndistressed beeps, nudging at your hand with his claw, then turning to\nhis creator. You absently patted him, trying to calm him down, but\nDUM-E never lived up to his name when it came to sensing yours or\nTony&rsquo;s mood. He was like a puppy, clumsy and inexperienced when it\ncame to most things, but he made it up with enthusiasm and never\nending spirit of always wanting to do his best for his favorite\nhumans.</p><p>As\nmuch as you loved and appreciated him for it, though, you really\nweren&rsquo;t able to let his comfort through right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,\ntell me this is a sick joke of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nlook on Tony&rsquo;s face when he turned to you told you that it was\neverything but. A desperate sound left your lips, and you moved over\nto Tony and the holograms he already had pulled up.</p><p>You\nweren&rsquo;t the CEO of Stark Industries and you had never planned on\nbecoming it. You didn&rsquo;t understand much of business, and you never\nwere and you never would be interested in it. The perks of the world\nnot knowing you were a Stark came with nobody expecting anything of\nyou. Your mother had done anything to be able to raise you without\nany paparazzi documenting every step you would take, so you learned\nto introduce yourself as a Carbonell, not a Stark, and while the\nworld knew the famous Tony Stark had a sister, they never had gotten\na name or a picture, and soon had lost interest in something they\ncouldn&rsquo;t present the world like a new toy.</p><p>However,\nback to the point: you didn&rsquo;t even want to understand half of the\nshit Tony was showing you, but Tony knew you would understand what he\nwanted you to understand.</p><p>He\neven marked the illegal transitions of weapons red.</p><p>&ldquo;I\ncannot believe it,&rdquo; you whispered, stepping closer. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re\nsure it is &hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony\nnodded, manipulating the hologram with a few flicks of his wrist and\nwagging fingers. &ldquo;The A.I. I had begun to program did an amazing\njob at its first quest. Really, it is a mere coincidence I decided\nfor it to check SI&rsquo;s latest transactions. It was all found on his\ncomputer.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nlooked at your brother, and even though he had the carefully blank\nmedia mask on, you knew deep down he was hurting at this betrayal.\nMaybe, no, surely even more than you, but he refused to let it show.</p><p>&ldquo;What\nare we gonna do now?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony\nsighed heavily, rubbed a hand across his forehead. You stepped closer\nand he immediately laid his arm around your shoulders, seeking\ncontact.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\nsue him, of course. I am not going to sit by while this man sells <i>my</i>\nweapons to terrorists. I don&rsquo;t need &hellip; I don&rsquo;t need that on my\nconscience.&rdquo;</p><p>His\nlower lip was wobbling, even though Tony tried his best to cease the\ntrembling.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nremember those reports of terrorists kidnapping children, and killing\ntheir parents, and who knows what else they do?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice\nbroke at the end. &ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s all my fault.&rdquo;</p><p>The\ncorners of your lips turned down fully at this. You hated seeing your\nbrother like this. His voice never broke. He never looked desperate\nor lost. He never had tears gathering in his eyes.</p><p>You\nnever had been your godfather&rsquo;s favorite, and the feeling was\nmutual, but there never had been a moment before where you hated\nObadiah Stane more than now.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nyou said, voice stern. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you start this shit. If it is\nsomeone&rsquo;s fault, it is his.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony\nfinally turned to you, blurring gaze trained on you. This was more\nthan Tony feeling guilty over the deaths caused by his weapons. It\nwas the betrayal of his godfather, someone he trusted, regardless of\nyour dislike of him; after all, Obie had been the only father figure\nbesides Jarvis who told Tony he was proud of him and his work.</p><p>The\nrelationship between you and Obie always was difficult. Just like\nyour father, he had more interest in Tony, and he rarely bothered to\nhide the fact. After your parents&rsquo; death, he made sure that Tony\ngot CEO and back to work as quickly as he could, offering him every\nhelp he might need.</p><p>Now,\nit was no wonder why he&rsquo;d been so eager on getting Tony back on\ntrack as soon as possible.</p><p>You\ngot angry, but before you had time to dwell on it, Tony sniffed and\naggressively wiped over his closed lids with his finger tips.</p><p>&ldquo;W-We\nneed to contact our lawyers. We need to do a press conference. We\nneed to collect more proof. Restrict his access to our data bank and\nstores. Freeze his whole Stark Industries account, we -&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>His\nwords got stuck in his throat, more tears had gathered in his eyes.\nIt made you even more angry. Looking grimly, you let Tony sag into\nyour side, wrapping your arms around him to let him hide. Barely\nthere sobs rattled his body.</p><p>Tony\nnever cried.</p><p>You\nhated it.</p><p>A\nfew angry tears rolled down your own face.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Peter\nhad a huge grin on his face, sitting next to you in his car seat as\nthe front-seat passenger.</p><p>Once\nin a while, you would take Peter with you instead of watching him at\nMay&rsquo;s, and today was &lsquo;once in a while.&rsquo; The little peanut\nnearly ran into the door in excitement when you told him he would\ncome with you. The prospect of finally seeing Tony again, had put him\ninto a great mood - and you hadn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell him, yet,\nthat he only would see Tony maybe five minutes tops.</p><p>As\nPeter had been hurriedly packing his little backpack (he came three\ntimes out of his room, exclaiming loudly that you could go now, only\nto be asked by you or May if he had thought of his little toothbrush,\na fresh pair of socks, or his water bottle he always brought to\nkindergarten,) May and Ben had sat down with you in the kitchen and\nasked how you and Tony were doing.</p><p>You\nwanted to say that you were fine, and Tony as well, but they had seen\nthe news report and knew what happened. May also happened to know\nthat Tony had always trusted and valued Obie. So, she had given you a\nstern look, and you had sighed, words now falling out of your mouth\nlike a waterfall.</p><p>The\nstress Tony was in caused by the search for more proof of Obadiah&rsquo;s\nbetrayal and then the following trial, and in turn how it stressed\nyou out to see your brother in so much work, he was practically\ndrowning. Not that he couldn&rsquo;t handle a full schedule, it was\nalways made sure of he someday knew how to run a business and that\nincluded packed days. No, it was more the reason of his now packed\nschedule why he didn&rsquo;t fare well.</p><p>It\npained you, that there didn&rsquo;t seem anything you could do.</p><p>Though,\nBen and May were quick to reassure you, that your sheer presence and\nmental support were an important thing to keep Tony going.</p><p>You\nsure hoped they were right, as you had nothing else to offer.</p><p>When\nyou and Peter left, they both hugged you tight, wishing you and Tony\nstrength.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re\nalways here for you,&rdquo; Ben had said, and you really had felt a tiny\nbit better after that.</p><p>And\nwith Peter around, one was just <i>bound</i> to feel better! How\ncould you not? That little ray of sunshine made you instantly feel\nbetter, and you hoped so much he had the same effect on Tony.</p><p>Additionally,\nPeter was just so excited to see Tony. It would break his heart if he\ndidn&rsquo;t get to see him even for a few minutes.</p><p>Peter\nwas already out the car and up the stairs to the front door before\nyou had exited the car yourself and got out his backpack. Jarvis must\nhave seen you two arriving because only a few seconds later the door\nwas opened and Peter hugged the butler&rsquo;s leg in greeting.</p><p>&ldquo;Good\nafternoon to you, too, young Mr. Parker,&rdquo; Jarvis, polite as ever,\ngreeted back, nodding to you with a calm &ldquo;Miss Y/N&rdquo; when you\nentered the building as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,\nJarvis,&rdquo; you said, helping Peter out of his shoes and jacket. &ldquo;You\nknow where Tony is? The peanut wants to see him.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter\nnodded frantically as he watched Jarvis put away his clothes.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir\nis currently in a meeting with a lawyer, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p><p>You\nsighed, one hand gliding over Peter&rsquo;s hair, whose owner was\npouting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, peanut, but I am sure we can at least eat\ndinner with him in a few hours.&rdquo;</p><p>Jarvis\nnodded. &ldquo;I will arrange everything to your liking, Miss Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling,\nyou thanked Jarvis.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Since\nthe reveal of illegal weapon transactions of Stark Industries, former\ninterim CEO Obadiah Stane is to appear in court. Accused by the\ncurrent CEO Tony Stark, Stane is believed to be working with a\nterrorist organization called the Ten Rings.</i></p><p><i>Read\nmore about this and see exclusive pictures on page 16.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Before\nBucky had been able to open the magazine to page sixteen, Steve had\nripped it out of his hands, tossing it to Sam. Bucky frowned at his\nfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nreally don&rsquo;t want to read that,&rdquo; Sam said, looking at him\nintently.</p><p>&ldquo;Again:\nwhy?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam\nshifted his gaze to Steve, whose corner of the mouth turned down. &ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It\ndoesn&rsquo;t matter if I like it. &lsquo;Sides, it&rsquo;s an article about\nsomeone selling the best weapons to date to some frickin&rsquo; terrorist\norganization, nobody likes it.&rdquo;</p><p>To\nBucky&rsquo;s benefit, Sam was still staring at Steve, realizing too late\nthat Bucky was going for the magazine. Sam jumped out of his seat as\nsoon as Bucky had snatched the paper, racing after him, but Bucky\nalready bounced into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.\nHurriedly, he opened the magazine on page sixteen.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>The\nTen Rings is a terrorists organization hellbent on destroying world\npeace by any means necessary. Just a few days ago, they are said to\nhave attacked the city Gulmira in Afghanistan, killing, one again, a\nfew dozen of innocent people.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Both\nSteve and Sam were hammering on the door. &ldquo;Buck, come on!&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky\nskipped the double page about the Ten Rings to get to those\n&ldquo;exclusive pictures.&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nget your panties in a twist, what&rsquo;s so special about -&rdquo; He froze\nwhen he saw you on several of those pictures.</p><p>It\nwas silent for a few seconds.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nknow, it is just a stupid gossip magazine.
