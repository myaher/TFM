But then, Oksana supposes, she wouldn\u2019t want it to remind her of Anna. Or of anything from before. Even her own name feels bitter and stale in her thoughts, like it belongs to someone else. Someone who is now dead, both in the eyes of the Russian government and her own.</p><p>She walks leisurely from room to empty room, less browsing and more just marveling at all this space. It almost feels like more than she would ever know what to do with, after years spent in that tiny prison cell.<b><br/></b></p><p>It\u2019s so much to take in that she almost doesn\u2019t see him, at first, which goes against all of her training. There is a man sitting on the still-stripped bed, and really, Oksana should\u2019ve expected this, some kind of trick or test. She draws her gun in the same time it takes for her to turn fully towards him, cocks it tellingly, but doesn\u2019t shoot. Yet.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d says the man pleasantly, in Russian. He hardly seems fazed.</p><p>Oksana gauges him to be in his early fifties, perhaps late forties. Old enough to remind her of her father, which makes her hackles rise, but she says nothing. Does nothing, except keep the weapon trained on him. If he is someone important, and she shoots him, she imagines her generous new employers will hardly be pleased.</p><p>The man\u2019s lips twitch. \u00a0\u201cI forgot,\u201d he continues - in English, this time. \u201cThey tell me you prefer English. No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench. Actually,\u201d Oksana says (though obligingly in English), mostly just to be difficult.</p><p>He chuckles in acknowledgement. \u201cEnglish will be more useful to you internationally. For now, we\u2019ll stick to that.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t yet asked her to put down the gun, perhaps confident that he has nothing to worry about. It ruffles Oksana a bit, that and the fact that he is so <i>different </i>from any of the agents who have trained her so far. There are no harsh lines in his face, nothing cold or analytical in his eyes. He looks almost kind. It makes Oksana wary.</p><p>She lowers the gun of her own accord, suspecting that might have been what he wanted all along. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Konstantin.\u201d Of course, that could be an alias. Oksana is sure they do not trust her yet. \u201cI am to be your handler from now on.\u201d</p><p>Inwardly, she processes that information cautiously. Outwardly, she works an eyebrow at him. \u201cSounds a little bit naughty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well. You are the one insisting we converse in English,\u201d Konstantin reminds her goodnaturedly, not reacting otherwise. That irks Oksana a bit too, but she doesn\u2019t let him see it this time.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cSo as my <i>handler</i>, what do you do? Are we going to train more?\u201d she asks, sizing him up.</p><p>\u201cA little. My job is more about overseeing you in yours.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019s to be the one keeping an eye on her, Oksana acknowledges silently. She isn\u2019t stupid enough to have thought they wouldn\u2019t send someone. \u00a0\u201cYou should see the scar I left on the last man who trained me. It ruined his pretty face. He is very angry, I think, but someone more important than he was must have been pleased.\u201d \u00a0She wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise, after all.</p><p>Konstantin smiles as though this anecdote does not surprise him, probably because he\u2019s heard about the incident from somewhere else. \u201cWas that not the point of the exercise?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs in response. \u201cThey gave me a knife and told me to defend myself. And he was a lot bigger than I was, so maybe he was just not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe it\u2019s him who needs more training.\u201d</p><p>The quip catches Oksana a little off guard. She doesn\u2019t return Konstantin\u2019s smile, too busy analyzing the joke. She wonders if it was meant to lull her, make it sound like he\u2019s on her side.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cOur training will not be about hurting one another,\u201d Konstantin continues, ignoring her pause. \u201cI think you already know how to do that well enough. So what I am going to teach you is more about\u2026 people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople.\u201d Oksana blinks. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere will be times when your job will not be quick. Times when it will take days, or weeks, of infiltration. We already know you are a good liar, but what we will ask of you will sometimes require more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to know how to be good with people,\u201d Oksana finishes for him. The idea is almost amusing.</p><p>Konstantin almost smirks. \u201cYou catch on quickly.\u201d</p><p>To assert some control over the conversation, Oksana moves over to the bed and sits next to Konstantin, almost shoulder to shoulder, though she does not particularly enjoy the proximity. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>He turns slightly to face her. \u00a0\u201cThen you will be very bad at your job.\u201d</p><p>And Oksana can\u2019t help but raise her eyebrows at that. \u00a0\u201cReally? You\u2019re not going to threaten me to do what you want? Be what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can already see you\u2019re not a person who responds well to threats.\u201d The glint in Konstantin\u2019s eyes is almost warm. Disconcerting. \u201cBesides, Oksana. I would like for you and I to be friends.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s his game, Oksana thinks. Konstantin thinks he can catch more flies with honey, or whatever the stupid English expression is. She sighs aloud, resting her chin in her hands. \u00a0\u201cYou are more boring than I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. You don\u2019t like the idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we skip to the interesting part?\u201d she suggests, evading. \u201cOur scandalous love affair? If you want me to seduce you first, I am very good at that.\u201d</p><p>Konstantin\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t quite fade. He doesn\u2019t even have the decency to pretend to be shocked, or scandalized. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a little young for me, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Oksana quirks an eyebrow disbelievingly. That\u2019s a line older men are supposed to use at first, she figures, except she can\u2019t imagine why someone like Konstantin would bother. \u00a0\u201cWould you get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not, if I said I was keeping you in line.\u201d \u00a0Konstantin shrugs. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the point. I said I would like for us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>She stares at him rather blankly for a moment. \u00a0If he was trying to control her, it\u2019s just as he said &ndash; it would be easier her way. Why put in all this extra effort?</p><p>He\u2019ll get bored of it soon enough anyway, she\u2019s certain. Maybe they\u2019ll send someone else. She wonders how many handlers she can go through while she\u2019s here, thinks it might be fun to find out. </p><p>But for now\u2026 she must settle for what she has.</p><p>She shifts beside him, fidgeting a little. \u00a0\u201cI want a new name,\u201d she says eventually, because it\u2019s as good a subject change as any.</p><p>Konstantin grunts in agreement. \u201cYou\u2019ll<i> need </i>a new name, seeing as you\u2019re now legally deceased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give me one?\u201d That\u2019s probably how these things work. They pick codenames for their assets, or whatever. Oksana watches Konstantin a little skeptically and thinks that maybe this could be some kind of bullshit psychological indicator of how he sees her, if she wanted it to be.</p><p>But Konstantin only shakes his head, smiling faintly still. \u201cI think,\u201d he tells her. \u201cYou are the one who ought to choose.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p><b><br/></b>There are now several important organizations who most definitely want Villanelle dead. \u00a0She\u2019s pretty sure it should count as some kind of accomplishment.<b><br/></b></p><p>She\u2019s less immediately concerned about MI6 - those idiots took years to find her, and that was only with Eve\u2019s help - and a little more concerned with the Twelve. They know her patterns, and many of her tricks, but what they do not know is that she is alive. They\u2019ll find all the blood in her apartment, the knife, and they\u2019ll have to wonder. At least for a little while.</p><p>It gives her a little time to recover. When she does, she can go looking for <i>them</i>.</p><p>The thing is, Villanelle is not very good at recovery.<b><br/></b></p><p>She finds an off-duty surgeon to stitch her up and can\u2019t risk reopening her injury to kill him afterwards, so she supposes she\u2019ll have to pray he doesn\u2019t run his mouth. Not that it matters, in the very brief time it takes her to disappear afterwards. But holeing herself up in one shitty hotel room after another gives her much too much time to think.</p><p>And she doesn\u2019t want to think. Not about Eve, for once, not right now. And not about Konstantin, who may or may not have survived the shot she\u2019d fired at him (she hadn\u2019t been aiming to kill, not quite, but there are too many variables in play for her to know whether that really matters).</p><p>As a bleak alternative, then, she thinks for a little while about Anna.</p><p>Anna.</p><p>Villanelle had missed her for a very long time. Now she knows it would have been better if they\u2019d never seen each other again.</p><p>She can\u2019t work out which of the things she\u2019d said to Anna were lies, and which were the truth. That happens sometimes. Villanelle spins things to get under people\u2019s skin, and sometimes ends up losing track of it all herself. She knows that when Anna had been pointing a gun at her, it had felt good to tell her that she no longer loved her. Like Anna would actually care. She knows that when she had her own gun in her hand, and had told Anna that she could shoot her, it had felt like the truth in the moment. </p><p>But she\u2019d never pulled the trigger. So now she would never know.<b><br/></b></p><p>Villanelle begrudgingly supposes that maybe Anna deserved to deprive her of that.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t fair that she can\u2019t get the images out of her head; Anna\u2019s gun pressed against her own throat, Anna crumpling as the shot rang out, all that blood soaking into the floor. Villanelle has long since stopped being fazed by violence, of course, so she doesn\u2019t know why this stays with her. As if Anna hasn\u2019t haunted her for long enough.</p><p>Villanelle knows she didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but she also knows it\u2019s still her fault. What she doesn\u2019t know is how she feels about that. Things she doesn\u2019t know how to name bubble in her chest unpleasantly, but really, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish that from the continuous ache of the knife wound in her side. Maybe it\u2019s all the same in the end.</p><p>There\u2019s a pen and a notepad on the bedside table of the hotel room. Villanelle contemplates them for a few moments. Wonders if she could still write pretty, flowing French words in pretty, flowing letters, and pretend that one day Anna would still read them.</p><p>She almost tries it. Pretending would make all of this much simpler. \u00a0But in the end, she doesn\u2019t know what she would say, and the truth is, Villanelle doesn\u2019t really want to think about this either.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>It\u2019s been two months since Eve stuck her with a knife. Villanelle thinks that seems fair. Fitting payback, to just let Eve <i>wonder</i> whether she\u2019s alive or dead for two whole months.<b><br/></b></p><p>She suspects it\u2019s kept Eve up at night, which is both amusing and intriguing. Villanelle hadn\u2019t thought Eve would stab her, and then when Eve had, Villanelle hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d feel bad about it afterwards. But Eve, Villanelle thinks, might never stop surprising her. She can\u2019t imagine a world in which she\u2019d ever find Eve <i>boring</i>. Maybe occasionally predictable, but only long enough to lull Villanelle into thinking she knows what Eve is about to do, until she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s missed her, really.<b><br/></b></p><p>When she does decide to pay Eve a little reunion visit, it\u2019s almost disconcertingly easy to track her down. She is no longer living with her husband (something which Villanelle is not particularly lamenting), but alone in a flat on the other side of London. If Villanelle had wanted to flatter herself, she might have speculated that Eve <i>wants</i> her to find her. Which is a nice thought, and all, except that Villanelle isn\u2019t the only person Eve needed to be concerned about.</p><p>So when Eve comes home one night, shoulders half-slumped with a kind of recognizable exhaustion, Villanelle is leisurely sprawled across her couch, and the first conversational thing she says is, \u201cIf I were one of the Twelve, you\u2019d be dead. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>Eve drops her bag and <i>screams</i>, and Villanelle rolls her eyes, because really, aren\u2019t they past this by now?</p><p>\u201cNot upping your chances,\u201d she adds, not bothering to sit up.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cYou &ndash;\u201d \u00a0Eve sputters after a shell-shocked moment. Villanelle expects her to continue, Eve can\u2019t seem to find the words.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget my name already?\u201d \u00a0Villanelle feigns a hurt expression. \u201cA girl would think you\u2019d already moved on to some other immensely talented, incredibly attractive international assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou &ndash;\u201d \u00a0Eve tries again \u201c &ndash; <i>fucking</i> asshole!\u201d</p><p>Villanelle has to try not to laugh. \u00a0\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were <i>dead</i>.\u201d</p><p>Did she? <i>Really</i>? Villanelle isn\u2019t sure whether she ought to be insulted or not. She smirks a little, all the same. \u201cYou sound very upset about it. Did you miss me that much?\u201d</p><p>Eve does not look impressed, however. Eve still looks somewhere between shocked and angry and &ndash; something else Villanelle can\u2019t identify. \u00a0\u201cWhere the hell have you<i> been </i>all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecovering.\u201d Villanelle shrugs slightly. \u201cIt takes a while, when you\u2019ve been stabbed in all your\u2026 vital organs. Your fault, if you didn\u2019t remember.\u201d Does Eve really have any room to blame her for not telling her where she was?<br/></p><p>Disregarding the bag she dropped on the floor, Eve keeps her eyes fixed on Villanelle, almost disbelievingly. Ignoring the strange, apprehensive pull in her chest, Villanelle feigns laziness as she watches Eve move tentatively a little closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t &ndash; um &ndash;\u201d</p><p>Villanelle smiles at her slightly. \u00a0\u201cYou meant to.\u201d<br/></p><p>There\u2019s a stiff pause.</p><p>\u201cWell. I\u2019m still sorry. I guess I didn\u2019t really realize that I &ndash; that you &ndash; I\u2019m just sorry.\u201d</p><p>If Villanelle\u2019s being honest with herself, she didn\u2019t really expect an apology. \u00a0It\u2019s blunt and almost strangled, and Villanelle thinks she should probably respond by telling Eve any of the things she\u2019s been feeling about it since the last time they saw each other. But it\u2019s one of those complicated things. Hard to put into words. Some strange mixture of betrayal and hurt and intrigue and an almost tender kind of pride.</p><p>\u201cI have this really crazy scar now,\u201d Villanelle tells her instead of any of those things. \u201cI kind of like it. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>Eve pales a little, but still manages to roll her eyes. \u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you don\u2019t want me to take my shirt off.\u201d</p><p>Eve snorts, and for a moment some of the tension between them seems to dissipate. But only for a moment. \u00a0\u201cAre you\u2026 here because you want revenge?\u201d It sounds oddly dramatic spoken aloud, and Eve scrunches her nose awkwardly. \u201cOr something?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s thought about it, of course. Long enough to know what the answer is. \u00a0\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think stabbing you would make me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s. Uh. Good.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle gives her a twitch of a smile, and, surprising her slightly yet again, Eve returns it carefully. Villanelle does sit up a little then, instinctively drawing her legs up to her chest, and Eve gingerly sits down on the other side of the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>are</i> you here for?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle is a little taken aback that Eve doesn\u2019t know the answer to that question &ndash; until she realizes she\u2019s not really sure she knows it herself. She shrugs lightly again. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eve agrees slowly, searching Villanelle\u2019s face for &ndash; something. Villanelle isn\u2019t sure what. \u201cI &ndash;\u201d But again, she cuts off, and Villanelle\u2019s smile turns a little more lofty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left you quite speechless, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2026 have to say, I. Wasn\u2019t expecting you to just. I mean. I thought you were <i>dead</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said. With that exact inflection.\u201d</p><p>Eve nudges her leg with her foot, a gesture that feels oddly casual and familiar, given that Villanelle can count the number of times they\u2019ve been alone together on one hand. \u00a0\u201cCan you take this seriously for a second? Isn\u2019t it dangerous for you to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Villanelle replies automatically &ndash; and then backtracks at a sudden realization. \u201c&ndash; I mean. I made sure I wasn\u2019t followed, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. You\u2019re not in any more danger than you were just &ndash; hanging out in some minimum security apartment in London.\u201d</p><p>Eve looks less sheepish than she would have expected. Of course, this is the woman who\u2019d set her iPhone password to \u20181-2-3-4\u2019. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired of running. I figured if the Twelve really wanted me, then just &ndash; fuck it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s smart,\u201d Villanelle notes sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a job, or a husband, or a\u2026 purpose anymore. I thought you were &ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d Villanelle finishes for her, a little softer. She considers for a moment, because maybe she wants Eve to be a lot of things, but not unhappy. Not &ndash; haphazardly disinterested in her own survival, though she suspects a part of that is just Eve playing it up. \u201cWell, now you know that I\u2019m not. So you will have to tough it out a little while longer, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Eve agrees, a little more wry, still watching her closely. \u00a0\u201c&hellip;What are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, <i>now </i>now?\u201d Villanelle pretends to think. \u00a0\u201cWhat is this, like, our third date? So &ndash;\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you know what I mean,\u201d Eve cuts in, though Villanelle takes a small amount of satisfaction in seeing that she\u2019s flushed a little. </p><p>\u201cRight. That.\u201d \u00a0Villanelle raises her eyebrows, vaguely mysterious. \u00a0\u201cI suppose it\u2019s still your job to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Eve reminds her. \u201cI was fired.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle isn\u2019t fooled for a moment. \u00a0\u201cAnd so you are just\u2026 giving up?\u201d</p><p>Eve meets her gaze for a heartbeat &ndash; and then sort of laughs. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>She looks less tired than she did when she came in, sounds more alive. There\u2019s a certain spark in her eyes, and Villanelle finds she\u2019s missed that, too. \u00a0\u201cGood,\u201d she retorts almost affectionately, and then abruptly rises from the couch. \u00a0\u201cThen consider this your pep talk, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait &ndash;\u201d Eve straightens a little, seeming taken aback. \u00a0\u201c&ndash; That\u2019s it? You\u2019re leaving?</p><p>Villanelle pauses. \u00a0\u201cWhy? Did you want to pick up where we left off, before\u2026 ?\u201d Much as she enjoys the teasing - and in all honesty, much as she\u2019d <i>like</i> to stay with Eve, with the force of something in her that twinges a little more strongly than she anticipated - it really isn\u2019t safe for her to spend a whole night in Eve\u2019s flat. She\u2019s not sure she trusts Eve that much, not quite yet, and even if she did\u2026 well. That\u2019s far from the only obstacle to account for.</p><p>But Eve is hesitating, like she\u2019s actually considering it, and Villanelle almost feels sort of bad &ndash; a rare and unpleasant experience. She leans down close, ignoring the way Eve instinctively tenses in response, and presses a brief kiss to her cheek. \u00a0\u201cWe will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for Eve to respond - and Eve doesn\u2019t, sitting stock still and not saying a word - Villanelle turns and saunters towards the door. \u00a0As an afterthought, she throws over her shoulder, \u201cUnless you\u2019ve gotten very rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Eve finally manages in response, half disgruntled and half goodnatured, and Villanelle laughs before she\u2019s out the door.</p><p>It\u2019d be a bad idea to stay this time, anyway. Eve might think she\u2019s getting soft on her. </p>",

But then, Oksana supposes, she wouldn\u2019t want it to remind her of Anna. Or of anything from before. Even her own name feels bitter and stale in her thoughts, like it belongs to someone else. Someone who is now dead, both in the eyes of the Russian government and her own.</p><p>She walks leisurely from room to empty room, less browsing and more just marveling at all this space. It almost feels like more than she would ever know what to do with, after years spent in that tiny prison cell.<b><br></b></p><p>It\u2019s so much to take in that she almost doesn\u2019t see him, at first, which goes against all of her training. There is a man sitting on the still-stripped bed, and really, Oksana should\u2019ve expected this, some kind of trick or test. She draws her gun in the same time it takes for her to turn fully towards him, cocks it tellingly, but doesn\u2019t shoot. Yet.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d says the man pleasantly, in Russian. He hardly seems fazed.</p><p>Oksana gauges him to be in his early fifties, perhaps late forties. Old enough to remind her of her father, which makes her hackles rise, but she says nothing. Does nothing, except keep the weapon trained on him. If he is someone important, and she shoots him, she imagines her generous new employers will hardly be pleased.</p><p>The man\u2019s lips twitch. \u00a0\u201cI forgot,\u201d he continues - in English, this time. \u201cThey tell me you prefer English. No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench. Actually,\u201d Oksana says (though obligingly in English), mostly just to be difficult.</p><p>He chuckles in acknowledgement. \u201cEnglish will be more useful to you internationally. For now, we\u2019ll stick to that.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t yet asked her to put down the gun, perhaps confident that he has nothing to worry about. It ruffles Oksana a bit, that and the fact that he is so <i>different </i>from any of the agents who have trained her so far. There are no harsh lines in his face, nothing cold or analytical in his eyes. He looks almost kind. It makes Oksana wary.</p><p>She lowers the gun of her own accord, suspecting that might have been what he wanted all along. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Konstantin.\u201d Of course, that could be an alias. Oksana is sure they do not trust her yet. \u201cI am to be your handler from now on.\u201d</p><p>Inwardly, she processes that information cautiously. Outwardly, she works an eyebrow at him. \u201cSounds a little bit naughty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well. You are the one insisting we converse in English,\u201d Konstantin reminds her goodnaturedly, not reacting otherwise. That irks Oksana a bit too, but she doesn\u2019t let him see it this time.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cSo as my <i>handler</i>, what do you do? Are we going to train more?\u201d she asks, sizing him up.</p><p>\u201cA little. My job is more about overseeing you in yours.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019s to be the one keeping an eye on her, Oksana acknowledges silently. She isn\u2019t stupid enough to have thought they wouldn\u2019t send someone. \u00a0\u201cYou should see the scar I left on the last man who trained me. It ruined his pretty face. He is very angry, I think, but someone more important than he was must have been pleased.\u201d \u00a0She wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise, after all.</p><p>Konstantin smiles as though this anecdote does not surprise him, probably because he\u2019s heard about the incident from somewhere else. \u201cWas that not the point of the exercise?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs in response. \u201cThey gave me a knife and told me to defend myself. And he was a lot bigger than I was, so maybe he was just not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe it\u2019s him who needs more training.\u201d</p><p>The quip catches Oksana a little off guard. She doesn\u2019t return Konstantin\u2019s smile, too busy analyzing the joke. She wonders if it was meant to lull her, make it sound like he\u2019s on her side.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cOur training will not be about hurting one another,\u201d Konstantin continues, ignoring her pause. \u201cI think you already know how to do that well enough. So what I am going to teach you is more about\u2026 people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople.\u201d Oksana blinks. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere will be times when your job will not be quick. Times when it will take days, or weeks, of infiltration. We already know you are a good liar, but what we will ask of you will sometimes require more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to know how to be good with people,\u201d Oksana finishes for him. The idea is almost amusing.</p><p>Konstantin almost smirks. \u201cYou catch on quickly.\u201d</p><p>To assert some control over the conversation, Oksana moves over to the bed and sits next to Konstantin, almost shoulder to shoulder, though she does not particularly enjoy the proximity. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>He turns slightly to face her. \u00a0\u201cThen you will be very bad at your job.\u201d</p><p>And Oksana can\u2019t help but raise her eyebrows at that. \u00a0\u201cReally? You\u2019re not going to threaten me to do what you want? Be what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can already see you\u2019re not a person who responds well to threats.\u201d The glint in Konstantin\u2019s eyes is almost warm. Disconcerting. \u201cBesides, Oksana. I would like for you and I to be friends.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s his game, Oksana thinks. Konstantin thinks he can catch more flies with honey, or whatever the stupid English expression is. She sighs aloud, resting her chin in her hands. \u00a0\u201cYou are more boring than I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. You don\u2019t like the idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we skip to the interesting part?\u201d she suggests, evading. \u201cOur scandalous love affair? If you want me to seduce you first, I am very good at that.\u201d</p><p>Konstantin\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t quite fade. He doesn\u2019t even have the decency to pretend to be shocked, or scandalized. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a little young for me, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Oksana quirks an eyebrow disbelievingly. That\u2019s a line older men are supposed to use at first, she figures, except she can\u2019t imagine why someone like Konstantin would bother. \u00a0\u201cWould you get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not, if I said I was keeping you in line.\u201d \u00a0Konstantin shrugs. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the point. I said I would like for us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>She stares at him rather blankly for a moment. \u00a0If he was trying to control her, it\u2019s just as he said \u2013 it would be easier her way. Why put in all this extra effort?</p><p>He\u2019ll get bored of it soon enough anyway, she\u2019s certain. Maybe they\u2019ll send someone else. She wonders how many handlers she can go through while she\u2019s here, thinks it might be fun to find out. </p><p>But for now\u2026 she must settle for what she has.</p><p>She shifts beside him, fidgeting a little. \u00a0\u201cI want a new name,\u201d she says eventually, because it\u2019s as good a subject change as any.</p><p>Konstantin grunts in agreement. \u201cYou\u2019ll<i> need </i>a new name, seeing as you\u2019re now legally deceased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give me one?\u201d That\u2019s probably how these things work. They pick codenames for their assets, or whatever. Oksana watches Konstantin a little skeptically and thinks that maybe this could be some kind of bullshit psychological indicator of how he sees her, if she wanted it to be.</p><p>But Konstantin only shakes his head, smiling faintly still. \u201cI think,\u201d he tells her. \u201cYou are the one who ought to choose.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p><b><br></b>There are now several important organizations who most definitely want Villanelle dead. \u00a0She\u2019s pretty sure it should count as some kind of accomplishment.<b><br></b></p><p>She\u2019s less immediately concerned about MI6 - those idiots took years to find her, and that was only with Eve\u2019s help - and a little more concerned with the Twelve. They know her patterns, and many of her tricks, but what they do not know is that she is alive. They\u2019ll find all the blood in her apartment, the knife, and they\u2019ll have to wonder. At least for a little while.</p><p>It gives her a little time to recover. When she does, she can go looking for <i>them</i>.</p><p>The thing is, Villanelle is not very good at recovery.<b><br></b></p><p>She finds an off-duty surgeon to stitch her up and can\u2019t risk reopening her injury to kill him afterwards, so she supposes she\u2019ll have to pray he doesn\u2019t run his mouth. Not that it matters, in the very brief time it takes her to disappear afterwards. But holeing herself up in one shitty hotel room after another gives her much too much time to think.</p><p>And she doesn\u2019t want to think. Not about Eve, for once, not right now. And not about Konstantin, who may or may not have survived the shot she\u2019d fired at him (she hadn\u2019t been aiming to kill, not quite, but there are too many variables in play for her to know whether that really matters).</p><p>As a bleak alternative, then, she thinks for a little while about Anna.</p><p>Anna.</p><p>Villanelle had missed her for a very long time. Now she knows it would have been better if they\u2019d never seen each other again.</p><p>She can\u2019t work out which of the things she\u2019d said to Anna were lies, and which were the truth. That happens sometimes. Villanelle spins things to get under people\u2019s skin, and sometimes ends up losing track of it all herself. She knows that when Anna had been pointing a gun at her, it had felt good to tell her that she no longer loved her. Like Anna would actually care. She knows that when she had her own gun in her hand, and had told Anna that she could shoot her, it had felt like the truth in the moment. </p><p>But she\u2019d never pulled the trigger. So now she would never know.<b><br></b></p><p>Villanelle begrudgingly supposes that maybe Anna deserved to deprive her of that.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t fair that she can\u2019t get the images out of her head; Anna\u2019s gun pressed against her own throat, Anna crumpling as the shot rang out, all that blood soaking into the floor. Villanelle has long since stopped being fazed by violence, of course, so she doesn\u2019t know why this stays with her. As if Anna hasn\u2019t haunted her for long enough.</p><p>Villanelle knows she didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but she also knows it\u2019s still her fault. What she doesn\u2019t know is how she feels about that. Things she doesn\u2019t know how to name bubble in her chest unpleasantly, but really, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish that from the continuous ache of the knife wound in her side. Maybe it\u2019s all the same in the end.</p><p>There\u2019s a pen and a notepad on the bedside table of the hotel room. Villanelle contemplates them for a few moments. Wonders if she could still write pretty, flowing French words in pretty, flowing letters, and pretend that one day Anna would still read them.</p><p>She almost tries it. Pretending would make all of this much simpler. \u00a0But in the end, she doesn\u2019t know what she would say, and the truth is, Villanelle doesn\u2019t really want to think about this either.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>It\u2019s been two months since Eve stuck her with a knife. Villanelle thinks that seems fair. Fitting payback, to just let Eve <i>wonder</i> whether she\u2019s alive or dead for two whole months.<b><br></b></p><p>She suspects it\u2019s kept Eve up at night, which is both amusing and intriguing. Villanelle hadn\u2019t thought Eve would stab her, and then when Eve had, Villanelle hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d feel bad about it afterwards. But Eve, Villanelle thinks, might never stop surprising her. She can\u2019t imagine a world in which she\u2019d ever find Eve <i>boring</i>. Maybe occasionally predictable, but only long enough to lull Villanelle into thinking she knows what Eve is about to do, until she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s missed her, really.<b><br></b></p><p>When she does decide to pay Eve a little reunion visit, it\u2019s almost disconcertingly easy to track her down. She is no longer living with her husband (something which Villanelle is not particularly lamenting), but alone in a flat on the other side of London. If Villanelle had wanted to flatter herself, she might have speculated that Eve <i>wants</i> her to find her. Which is a nice thought, and all, except that Villanelle isn\u2019t the only person Eve needed to be concerned about.</p><p>So when Eve comes home one night, shoulders half-slumped with a kind of recognizable exhaustion, Villanelle is leisurely sprawled across her couch, and the first conversational thing she says is, \u201cIf I were one of the Twelve, you\u2019d be dead. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>Eve drops her bag and <i>screams</i>, and Villanelle rolls her eyes, because really, aren\u2019t they past this by now?</p><p>\u201cNot upping your chances,\u201d she adds, not bothering to sit up.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cYou \u2013\u201d \u00a0Eve sputters after a shell-shocked moment. Villanelle expects her to continue, Eve can\u2019t seem to find the words.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget my name already?\u201d \u00a0Villanelle feigns a hurt expression. \u201cA girl would think you\u2019d already moved on to some other immensely talented, incredibly attractive international assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou \u2013\u201d \u00a0Eve tries again \u201c \u2013 <i>fucking</i> asshole!\u201d</p><p>Villanelle has to try not to laugh. \u00a0\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were <i>dead</i>.\u201d</p><p>Did she? <i>Really</i>? Villanelle isn\u2019t sure whether she ought to be insulted or not. She smirks a little, all the same. \u201cYou sound very upset about it. Did you miss me that much?\u201d</p><p>Eve does not look impressed, however. Eve still looks somewhere between shocked and angry and \u2013 something else Villanelle can\u2019t identify. \u00a0\u201cWhere the hell have you<i> been </i>all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecovering.\u201d Villanelle shrugs slightly. \u201cIt takes a while, when you\u2019ve been stabbed in all your\u2026 vital organs. Your fault, if you didn\u2019t remember.\u201d Does Eve really have any room to blame her for not telling her where she was?<br></p><p>Disregarding the bag she dropped on the floor, Eve keeps her eyes fixed on Villanelle, almost disbelievingly. Ignoring the strange, apprehensive pull in her chest, Villanelle feigns laziness as she watches Eve move tentatively a little closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 um \u2013\u201d</p><p>Villanelle smiles at her slightly. \u00a0\u201cYou meant to.\u201d<br></p><p>There\u2019s a stiff pause.</p><p>\u201cWell. I\u2019m still sorry. I guess I didn\u2019t really realize that I \u2013 that you \u2013 I\u2019m just sorry.\u201d</p><p>If Villanelle\u2019s being honest with herself, she didn\u2019t really expect an apology. \u00a0It\u2019s blunt and almost strangled, and Villanelle thinks she should probably respond by telling Eve any of the things she\u2019s been feeling about it since the last time they saw each other. But it\u2019s one of those complicated things. Hard to put into words. Some strange mixture of betrayal and hurt and intrigue and an almost tender kind of pride.</p><p>\u201cI have this really crazy scar now,\u201d Villanelle tells her instead of any of those things. \u201cI kind of like it. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>Eve pales a little, but still manages to roll her eyes. \u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you don\u2019t want me to take my shirt off.\u201d</p><p>Eve snorts, and for a moment some of the tension between them seems to dissipate. But only for a moment. \u00a0\u201cAre you\u2026 here because you want revenge?\u201d It sounds oddly dramatic spoken aloud, and Eve scrunches her nose awkwardly. \u201cOr something?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s thought about it, of course. Long enough to know what the answer is. \u00a0\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think stabbing you would make me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s. Uh. Good.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle gives her a twitch of a smile, and, surprising her slightly yet again, Eve returns it carefully. Villanelle does sit up a little then, instinctively drawing her legs up to her chest, and Eve gingerly sits down on the other side of the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>are</i> you here for?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle is a little taken aback that Eve doesn\u2019t know the answer to that question \u2013 until she realizes she\u2019s not really sure she knows it herself. She shrugs lightly again. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eve agrees slowly, searching Villanelle\u2019s face for \u2013 something. Villanelle isn\u2019t sure what. \u201cI \u2013\u201d But again, she cuts off, and Villanelle\u2019s smile turns a little more lofty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left you quite speechless, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2026 have to say, I. Wasn\u2019t expecting you to just. I mean. I thought you were <i>dead</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said. With that exact inflection.\u201d</p><p>Eve nudges her leg with her foot, a gesture that feels oddly casual and familiar, given that Villanelle can count the number of times they\u2019ve been alone together on one hand. \u00a0\u201cCan you take this seriously for a second? Isn\u2019t it dangerous for you to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Villanelle replies automatically \u2013 and then backtracks at a sudden realization. \u201c\u2013 I mean. I made sure I wasn\u2019t followed, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. You\u2019re not in any more danger than you were just \u2013 hanging out in some minimum security apartment in London.\u201d</p><p>Eve looks less sheepish than she would have expected. Of course, this is the woman who\u2019d set her iPhone password to \u20181-2-3-4\u2019. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired of running. I figured if the Twelve really wanted me, then just \u2013 fuck it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s smart,\u201d Villanelle notes sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a job, or a husband, or a\u2026 purpose anymore. I thought you were \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d Villanelle finishes for her, a little softer. She considers for a moment, because maybe she wants Eve to be a lot of things, but not unhappy. Not \u2013 haphazardly disinterested in her own survival, though she suspects a part of that is just Eve playing it up. \u201cWell, now you know that I\u2019m not. So you will have to tough it out a little while longer, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Eve agrees, a little more wry, still watching her closely. \u00a0\u201c\u2026What are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, <i>now </i>now?\u201d Villanelle pretends to think. \u00a0\u201cWhat is this, like, our third date? So \u2013\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you know what I mean,\u201d Eve cuts in, though Villanelle takes a small amount of satisfaction in seeing that she\u2019s flushed a little. </p><p>\u201cRight. That.\u201d \u00a0Villanelle raises her eyebrows, vaguely mysterious. \u00a0\u201cI suppose it\u2019s still your job to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Eve reminds her. \u201cI was fired.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle isn\u2019t fooled for a moment. \u00a0\u201cAnd so you are just\u2026 giving up?\u201d</p><p>Eve meets her gaze for a heartbeat \u2013 and then sort of laughs. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>She looks less tired than she did when she came in, sounds more alive. There\u2019s a certain spark in her eyes, and Villanelle finds she\u2019s missed that, too. \u00a0\u201cGood,\u201d she retorts almost affectionately, and then abruptly rises from the couch. \u00a0\u201cThen consider this your pep talk, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait \u2013\u201d Eve straightens a little, seeming taken aback. \u00a0\u201c\u2013 That\u2019s it? You\u2019re leaving?</p><p>Villanelle pauses. \u00a0\u201cWhy? Did you want to pick up where we left off, before\u2026 ?\u201d Much as she enjoys the teasing - and in all honesty, much as she\u2019d <i>like</i> to stay with Eve, with the force of something in her that twinges a little more strongly than she anticipated - it really isn\u2019t safe for her to spend a whole night in Eve\u2019s flat. She\u2019s not sure she trusts Eve that much, not quite yet, and even if she did\u2026 well. That\u2019s far from the only obstacle to account for.</p><p>But Eve is hesitating, like she\u2019s actually considering it, and Villanelle almost feels sort of bad \u2013 a rare and unpleasant experience. She leans down close, ignoring the way Eve instinctively tenses in response, and presses a brief kiss to her cheek. \u00a0\u201cWe will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for Eve to respond - and Eve doesn\u2019t, sitting stock still and not saying a word - Villanelle turns and saunters towards the door. \u00a0As an afterthought, she throws over her shoulder, \u201cUnless you\u2019ve gotten very rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Eve finally manages in response, half disgruntled and half goodnatured, and Villanelle laughs before she\u2019s out the door.</p><p>It\u2019d be a bad idea to stay this time, anyway. Eve might think she\u2019s getting soft on her. </p>",

But then, Oksana supposes, she wouldn\u2019t want it to remind her of Anna. Or of anything from before. Even her own name feels bitter and stale in her thoughts, like it belongs to someone else. Someone who is now dead, both in the eyes of the Russian government and her own.</p><p>She walks leisurely from room to empty room, less browsing and more just marveling at all this space. It almost feels like more than she would ever know what to do with, after years spent in that tiny prison cell.<b><br></b></p><p>It\u2019s so much to take in that she almost doesn\u2019t see him, at first, which goes against all of her training. There is a man sitting on the still-stripped bed, and really, Oksana should\u2019ve expected this, some kind of trick or test. She draws her gun in the same time it takes for her to turn fully towards him, cocks it tellingly, but doesn\u2019t shoot. Yet.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d says the man pleasantly, in Russian. He hardly seems fazed.</p><p>Oksana gauges him to be in his early fifties, perhaps late forties. Old enough to remind her of her father, which makes her hackles rise, but she says nothing. Does nothing, except keep the weapon trained on him. If he is someone important, and she shoots him, she imagines her generous new employers will hardly be pleased.</p><p>The man\u2019s lips twitch. \u00a0\u201cI forgot,\u201d he continues - in English, this time. \u201cThey tell me you prefer English. No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench. Actually,\u201d Oksana says (though obligingly in English), mostly just to be difficult.</p><p>He chuckles in acknowledgement. \u201cEnglish will be more useful to you internationally. For now, we\u2019ll stick to that.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t yet asked her to put down the gun, perhaps confident that he has nothing to worry about. It ruffles Oksana a bit, that and the fact that he is so <i>different </i>from any of the agents who have trained her so far. There are no harsh lines in his face, nothing cold or analytical in his eyes. He looks almost kind. It makes Oksana wary.</p><p>She lowers the gun of her own accord, suspecting that might have been what he wanted all along. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Konstantin.\u201d Of course, that could be an alias. Oksana is sure they do not trust her yet. \u201cI am to be your handler from now on.\u201d</p><p>Inwardly, she processes that information cautiously. Outwardly, she works an eyebrow at him. \u201cSounds a little bit naughty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well. You are the one insisting we converse in English,\u201d Konstantin reminds her goodnaturedly, not reacting otherwise. That irks Oksana a bit too, but she doesn\u2019t let him see it this time.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cSo as my <i>handler</i>, what do you do? Are we going to train more?\u201d she asks, sizing him up.</p><p>\u201cA little. My job is more about overseeing you in yours.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019s to be the one keeping an eye on her, Oksana acknowledges silently. She isn\u2019t stupid enough to have thought they wouldn\u2019t send someone. \u00a0\u201cYou should see the scar I left on the last man who trained me. It ruined his pretty face. He is very angry, I think, but someone more important than he was must have been pleased.\u201d \u00a0She wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise, after all.</p><p>Konstantin smiles as though this anecdote does not surprise him, probably because he\u2019s heard about the incident from somewhere else. \u201cWas that not the point of the exercise?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs in response. \u201cThey gave me a knife and told me to defend myself. And he was a lot bigger than I was, so maybe he was just not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe it\u2019s him who needs more training.\u201d</p><p>The quip catches Oksana a little off guard. She doesn\u2019t return Konstantin\u2019s smile, too busy analyzing the joke. She wonders if it was meant to lull her, make it sound like he\u2019s on her side.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cOur training will not be about hurting one another,\u201d Konstantin continues, ignoring her pause. \u201cI think you already know how to do that well enough. So what I am going to teach you is more about\u2026 people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople.\u201d Oksana blinks. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere will be times when your job will not be quick. Times when it will take days, or weeks, of infiltration. We already know you are a good liar, but what we will ask of you will sometimes require more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to know how to be good with people,\u201d Oksana finishes for him. The idea is almost amusing.</p><p>Konstantin almost smirks. \u201cYou catch on quickly.\u201d</p><p>To assert some control over the conversation, Oksana moves over to the bed and sits next to Konstantin, almost shoulder to shoulder, though she does not particularly enjoy the proximity. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>He turns slightly to face her. \u00a0\u201cThen you will be very bad at your job.\u201d</p><p>And Oksana can\u2019t help but raise her eyebrows at that. \u00a0\u201cReally? You\u2019re not going to threaten me to do what you want? Be what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can already see you\u2019re not a person who responds well to threats.\u201d The glint in Konstantin\u2019s eyes is almost warm. Disconcerting. \u201cBesides, Oksana. I would like for you and I to be friends.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s his game, Oksana thinks. Konstantin thinks he can catch more flies with honey, or whatever the stupid English expression is. She sighs aloud, resting her chin in her hands. \u00a0\u201cYou are more boring than I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. You don\u2019t like the idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we skip to the interesting part?\u201d she suggests, evading. \u201cOur scandalous love affair? If you want me to seduce you first, I am very good at that.\u201d</p><p>Konstantin\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t quite fade. He doesn\u2019t even have the decency to pretend to be shocked, or scandalized. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a little young for me, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Oksana quirks an eyebrow disbelievingly. That\u2019s a line older men are supposed to use at first, she figures, except she can\u2019t imagine why someone like Konstantin would bother. \u00a0\u201cWould you get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not, if I said I was keeping you in line.\u201d \u00a0Konstantin shrugs. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the point. I said I would like for us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>She stares at him rather blankly for a moment. \u00a0If he was trying to control her, it\u2019s just as he said \u2013 it would be easier her way. Why put in all this extra effort?</p><p>He\u2019ll get bored of it soon enough anyway, she\u2019s certain. Maybe they\u2019ll send someone else. She wonders how many handlers she can go through while she\u2019s here, thinks it might be fun to find out. </p><p>But for now\u2026 she must settle for what she has.</p><p>She shifts beside him, fidgeting a little. \u00a0\u201cI want a new name,\u201d she says eventually, because it\u2019s as good a subject change as any.</p><p>Konstantin grunts in agreement. \u201cYou\u2019ll<i> need </i>a new name, seeing as you\u2019re now legally deceased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give me one?\u201d That\u2019s probably how these things work. They pick codenames for their assets, or whatever. Oksana watches Konstantin a little skeptically and thinks that maybe this could be some kind of bullshit psychological indicator of how he sees her, if she wanted it to be.</p><p>But Konstantin only shakes his head, smiling faintly still. \u201cI think,\u201d he tells her. \u201cYou are the one who ought to choose.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p><b><br></b>There are now several important organizations who most definitely want Villanelle dead. \u00a0She\u2019s pretty sure it should count as some kind of accomplishment.<b><br></b></p><p>She\u2019s less immediately concerned about MI6 - those idiots took years to find her, and that was only with Eve\u2019s help - and a little more concerned with the Twelve. They know her patterns, and many of her tricks, but what they do not know is that she is alive. They\u2019ll find all the blood in her apartment, the knife, and they\u2019ll have to wonder. At least for a little while.</p><p>It gives her a little time to recover. When she does, she can go looking for <i>them</i>.</p><p>The thing is, Villanelle is not very good at recovery.<b><br></b></p><p>She finds an off-duty surgeon to stitch her up and can\u2019t risk reopening her injury to kill him afterwards, so she supposes she\u2019ll have to pray he doesn\u2019t run his mouth. Not that it matters, in the very brief time it takes her to disappear afterwards. But holeing herself up in one shitty hotel room after another gives her much too much time to think.</p><p>And she doesn\u2019t want to think. Not about Eve, for once, not right now. And not about Konstantin, who may or may not have survived the shot she\u2019d fired at him (she hadn\u2019t been aiming to kill, not quite, but there are too many variables in play for her to know whether that really matters).</p><p>As a bleak alternative, then, she thinks for a little while about Anna.</p><p>Anna.</p><p>Villanelle had missed her for a very long time. Now she knows it would have been better if they\u2019d never seen each other again.</p><p>She can\u2019t work out which of the things she\u2019d said to Anna were lies, and which were the truth. That happens sometimes. Villanelle spins things to get under people\u2019s skin, and sometimes ends up losing track of it all herself. She knows that when Anna had been pointing a gun at her, it had felt good to tell her that she no longer loved her. Like Anna would actually care. She knows that when she had her own gun in her hand, and had told Anna that she could shoot her, it had felt like the truth in the moment. </p><p>But she\u2019d never pulled the trigger. So now she would never know.<b><br></b></p><p>Villanelle begrudgingly supposes that maybe Anna deserved to deprive her of that.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t fair that she can\u2019t get the images out of her head; Anna\u2019s gun pressed against her own throat, Anna crumpling as the shot rang out, all that blood soaking into the floor. Villanelle has long since stopped being fazed by violence, of course, so she doesn\u2019t know why this stays with her. As if Anna hasn\u2019t haunted her for long enough.</p><p>Villanelle knows she didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but she also knows it\u2019s still her fault. What she doesn\u2019t know is how she feels about that. Things she doesn\u2019t know how to name bubble in her chest unpleasantly, but really, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish that from the continuous ache of the knife wound in her side. Maybe it\u2019s all the same in the end.</p><p>There\u2019s a pen and a notepad on the bedside table of the hotel room. Villanelle contemplates them for a few moments. Wonders if she could still write pretty, flowing French words in pretty, flowing letters, and pretend that one day Anna would still read them.</p><p>She almost tries it. Pretending would make all of this much simpler. \u00a0But in the end, she doesn\u2019t know what she would say, and the truth is, Villanelle doesn\u2019t really want to think about this either.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>It\u2019s been two months since Eve stuck her with a knife. Villanelle thinks that seems fair. Fitting payback, to just let Eve <i>wonder</i> whether she\u2019s alive or dead for two whole months.<b><br></b></p><p>She suspects it\u2019s kept Eve up at night, which is both amusing and intriguing. Villanelle hadn\u2019t thought Eve would stab her, and then when Eve had, Villanelle hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d feel bad about it afterwards. But Eve, Villanelle thinks, might never stop surprising her. She can\u2019t imagine a world in which she\u2019d ever find Eve <i>boring</i>. Maybe occasionally predictable, but only long enough to lull Villanelle into thinking she knows what Eve is about to do, until she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s missed her, really.<b><br></b></p><p>When she does decide to pay Eve a little reunion visit, it\u2019s almost disconcertingly easy to track her down. She is no longer living with her husband (something which Villanelle is not particularly lamenting), but alone in a flat on the other side of London. If Villanelle had wanted to flatter herself, she might have speculated that Eve <i>wants</i> her to find her. Which is a nice thought, and all, except that Villanelle isn\u2019t the only person Eve needed to be concerned about.</p><p>So when Eve comes home one night, shoulders half-slumped with a kind of recognizable exhaustion, Villanelle is leisurely sprawled across her couch, and the first conversational thing she says is, \u201cIf I were one of the Twelve, you\u2019d be dead. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>Eve drops her bag and <i>screams</i>, and Villanelle rolls her eyes, because really, aren\u2019t they past this by now?</p><p>\u201cNot upping your chances,\u201d she adds, not bothering to sit up.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cYou \u2013\u201d \u00a0Eve sputters after a shell-shocked moment. Villanelle expects her to continue, Eve can\u2019t seem to find the words.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget my name already?\u201d \u00a0Villanelle feigns a hurt expression. \u201cA girl would think you\u2019d already moved on to some other immensely talented, incredibly attractive international assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou \u2013\u201d \u00a0Eve tries again \u201c \u2013 <i>fucking</i> asshole!\u201d</p><p>Villanelle has to try not to laugh. \u00a0\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were <i>dead</i>.\u201d</p><p>Did she? <i>Really</i>? Villanelle isn\u2019t sure whether she ought to be insulted or not. She smirks a little, all the same. \u201cYou sound very upset about it. Did you miss me that much?\u201d</p><p>Eve does not look impressed, however. Eve still looks somewhere between shocked and angry and \u2013 something else Villanelle can\u2019t identify. \u00a0\u201cWhere the hell have you<i> been </i>all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecovering.\u201d Villanelle shrugs slightly. \u201cIt takes a while, when you\u2019ve been stabbed in all your\u2026 vital organs. Your fault, if you didn\u2019t remember.\u201d Does Eve really have any room to blame her for not telling her where she was?<br></p><p>Disregarding the bag she dropped on the floor, Eve keeps her eyes fixed on Villanelle, almost disbelievingly. Ignoring the strange, apprehensive pull in her chest, Villanelle feigns laziness as she watches Eve move tentatively a little closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 um \u2013\u201d</p><p>Villanelle smiles at her slightly. \u00a0\u201cYou meant to.\u201d<br></p><p>There\u2019s a stiff pause.</p><p>\u201cWell. I\u2019m still sorry. I guess I didn\u2019t really realize that I \u2013 that you \u2013 I\u2019m just sorry.\u201d</p><p>If Villanelle\u2019s being honest with herself, she didn\u2019t really expect an apology. \u00a0It\u2019s blunt and almost strangled, and Villanelle thinks she should probably respond by telling Eve any of the things she\u2019s been feeling about it since the last time they saw each other. But it\u2019s one of those complicated things. Hard to put into words. Some strange mixture of betrayal and hurt and intrigue and an almost tender kind of pride.</p><p>\u201cI have this really crazy scar now,\u201d Villanelle tells her instead of any of those things. \u201cI kind of like it. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>Eve pales a little, but still manages to roll her eyes. \u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you don\u2019t want me to take my shirt off.\u201d</p><p>Eve snorts, and for a moment some of the tension between them seems to dissipate. But only for a moment. \u00a0\u201cAre you\u2026 here because you want revenge?\u201d It sounds oddly dramatic spoken aloud, and Eve scrunches her nose awkwardly. \u201cOr something?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle\u2019s thought about it, of course. Long enough to know what the answer is. \u00a0\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think stabbing you would make me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s. Uh. Good.\u201d</p><p>Villanelle gives her a twitch of a smile, and, surprising her slightly yet again, Eve returns it carefully. Villanelle does sit up a little then, instinctively drawing her legs up to her chest, and Eve gingerly sits down on the other side of the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>are</i> you here for?\u201d</p><p>Villanelle is a little taken aback that Eve doesn\u2019t know the answer to that question \u2013 until she realizes she\u2019s not really sure she knows it herself. She shrugs lightly again. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eve agrees slowly, searching Villanelle\u2019s face for \u2013 something. Villanelle isn\u2019t sure what. \u201cI \u2013\u201d But again, she cuts off, and Villanelle\u2019s smile turns a little more lofty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left you quite speechless, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2026 have to say, I. Wasn\u2019t expecting you to just. I mean. I thought you were <i>dead</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said. With that exact inflection.\u201d</p><p>Eve nudges her leg with her foot, a gesture that feels oddly casual and familiar, given that Villanelle can count the number of times they\u2019ve been alone together on one hand. \u00a0\u201cCan you take this seriously for a second? Isn\u2019t it dangerous for you to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Villanelle replies automatically \u2013 and then backtracks at a sudden realization. \u201c\u2013 I mean. I made sure I wasn\u2019t followed, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. You\u2019re not in any more danger than you were just \u2013 hanging out in some minimum security apartment in London.\u201d</p><p>Eve looks less sheepish than she would have expected. Of course, this is the woman who\u2019d set her iPhone password to \u20181-2-3-4\u2019. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m tired of running. I figured if the Twelve really wanted me, then just \u2013 fuck it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s smart,\u201d Villanelle notes sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a job, or a husband, or a\u2026 purpose anymore. I thought you were \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d Villanelle finishes for her, a little softer. She considers for a moment, because maybe she wants Eve to be a lot of things, but not unhappy. Not \u2013 haphazardly disinterested in her own survival, though she suspects a part of that is just Eve playing it up. \u201cWell, now you know that I\u2019m not.

                "content": "<p>okay so as a collective piece i don&rsquo;t really know what this is but <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mORz94VkcSBCXou_95PQsCw\">@fizzlep0p</a> was interested in me writing villanelle&rsquo;s perspective re: the few people in her life who&rsquo;ve been important to her, and killing eve in general has been buzzing around in my head a lot, so this is a thing! it gets a bit unexpectedly sad towards the middle but i can&rsquo;t really write killing eve with <i>too</i> much angst, so. just some little pieces of character / relationship study, i guess</p><p>the first is pre-canon and the other two are post-canon, as a note</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nThere are now several important organizations who most definitely want Villanelle dead. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s pretty sure it should count as some kind of accomplishment.\n\n</i><br /></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>The apartment they lease for her is beautiful &ndash; not quite extravagant, but more spacious and airy and<i> nice</i> than anything else Oksana has ever been able to call her own.</p><p>Not warm and homey and personal like Anna&rsquo;s flat was. But then, Oksana supposes, she wouldn&rsquo;t want it to remind her of Anna. Or of anything from before. Even her own name feels bitter and stale in her thoughts, like it belongs to someone else. Someone who is now dead, both in the eyes of the Russian government and her own.</p><p>She walks leisurely from room to empty room, less browsing and more just marveling at all this space. It almost feels like more than she would ever know what to do with, after years spent in that tiny prison cell.<b><br /></b></p><p>It&rsquo;s so much to take in that she almost doesn&rsquo;t see him, at first, which goes against all of her training. There is a man sitting on the still-stripped bed, and really, Oksana should&rsquo;ve expected this, some kind of trick or test. She draws her gun in the same time it takes for her to turn fully towards him, cocks it tellingly, but doesn&rsquo;t shoot. Yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; says the man pleasantly, in Russian. He hardly seems fazed.</p><p>Oksana gauges him to be in his early fifties, perhaps late forties. Old enough to remind her of her father, which makes her hackles rise, but she says nothing. Does nothing, except keep the weapon trained on him. If he is someone important, and she shoots him, she imagines her generous new employers will hardly be pleased.</p><p>The man&rsquo;s lips twitch. &nbsp;&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; he continues - in English, this time. &ldquo;They tell me you prefer English. No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;French. Actually,&rdquo; Oksana says (though obligingly in English), mostly just to be difficult.</p><p>He chuckles in acknowledgement. &ldquo;English will be more useful to you internationally. For now, we&rsquo;ll stick to that.&rdquo;</p><p>He hasn&rsquo;t yet asked her to put down the gun, perhaps confident that he has nothing to worry about. It ruffles Oksana a bit, that and the fact that he is so <i>different </i>from any of the agents who have trained her so far. There are no harsh lines in his face, nothing cold or analytical in his eyes. He looks almost kind. It makes Oksana wary.</p><p>She lowers the gun of her own accord, suspecting that might have been what he wanted all along. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Konstantin.&rdquo; Of course, that could be an alias. Oksana is sure they do not trust her yet. &ldquo;I am to be your handler from now on.&rdquo;</p><p>Inwardly, she processes that information cautiously. Outwardly, she works an eyebrow at him. &ldquo;Sounds a little bit naughty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Well. You are the one insisting we converse in English,&rdquo; Konstantin reminds her goodnaturedly, not reacting otherwise. That irks Oksana a bit too, but she doesn&rsquo;t let him see it this time.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;So as my <i>handler</i>, what do you do? Are we going to train more?&rdquo; she asks, sizing him up.</p><p>&ldquo;A little. My job is more about overseeing you in yours.&rdquo;</p><p>So he&rsquo;s to be the one keeping an eye on her, Oksana acknowledges silently. She isn&rsquo;t stupid enough to have thought they wouldn&rsquo;t send someone. &nbsp;&ldquo;You should see the scar I left on the last man who trained me. It ruined his pretty face. He is very angry, I think, but someone more important than he was must have been pleased.&rdquo; &nbsp;She wouldn&rsquo;t be here otherwise, after all.</p><p>Konstantin smiles as though this anecdote does not surprise him, probably because he&rsquo;s heard about the incident from somewhere else. &ldquo;Was that not the point of the exercise?&rdquo;</p><p>She shrugs in response. &ldquo;They gave me a knife and told me to defend myself. And he was a lot bigger than I was, so maybe he was just not good enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Maybe it&rsquo;s him who needs more training.&rdquo;</p><p>The quip catches Oksana a little off guard. She doesn&rsquo;t return Konstantin&rsquo;s smile, too busy analyzing the joke. She wonders if it was meant to lull her, make it sound like he&rsquo;s on her side.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Our training will not be about hurting one another,&rdquo; Konstantin continues, ignoring her pause. &ldquo;I think you already know how to do that well enough. So what I am going to teach you is more about&hellip; people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People.&rdquo; Oksana blinks. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There will be times when your job will not be quick. Times when it will take days, or weeks, of infiltration. We already know you are a good liar, but what we will ask of you will sometimes require more than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you want me to know how to be good with people,&rdquo; Oksana finishes for him. The idea is almost amusing.</p><p>Konstantin almost smirks. &ldquo;You catch on quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>To assert some control over the conversation, Oksana moves over to the bed and sits next to Konstantin, almost shoulder to shoulder, though she does not particularly enjoy the proximity. &ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p><p>He turns slightly to face her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then you will be very bad at your job.&rdquo;</p><p>And Oksana can&rsquo;t help but raise her eyebrows at that. &nbsp;&ldquo;Really? You&rsquo;re not going to threaten me to do what you want? Be what you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can already see you&rsquo;re not a person who responds well to threats.&rdquo; The glint in Konstantin&rsquo;s eyes is almost warm. Disconcerting. &ldquo;Besides, Oksana. I would like for you and I to be friends.&rdquo;</p><p>So that&rsquo;s his game, Oksana thinks. Konstantin thinks he can catch more flies with honey, or whatever the stupid English expression is. She sighs aloud, resting her chin in her hands. &nbsp;&ldquo;You are more boring than I thought you&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm. You don&rsquo;t like the idea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we skip to the interesting part?&rdquo; she suggests, evading. &ldquo;Our scandalous love affair? If you want me to seduce you first, I am very good at that.&rdquo;</p><p>Konstantin&rsquo;s smile doesn&rsquo;t quite fade. He doesn&rsquo;t even have the decency to pretend to be shocked, or scandalized. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little young for me, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p><p>Oksana quirks an eyebrow disbelievingly. That&rsquo;s a line older men are supposed to use at first, she figures, except she can&rsquo;t imagine why someone like Konstantin would bother. &nbsp;&ldquo;Would you get in trouble?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. Maybe not, if I said I was keeping you in line.&rdquo; &nbsp;Konstantin shrugs. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the point. I said I would like for us to be friends.&rdquo;</p><p>She stares at him rather blankly for a moment. &nbsp;If he was trying to control her, it&rsquo;s just as he said &ndash; it would be easier her way. Why put in all this extra effort?</p><p>He&rsquo;ll get bored of it soon enough anyway, she&rsquo;s certain. Maybe they&rsquo;ll send someone else. She wonders how many handlers she can go through while she&rsquo;s here, thinks it might be fun to find out. </p><p>But for now&hellip; she must settle for what she has.</p><p>She shifts beside him, fidgeting a little. &nbsp;&ldquo;I want a new name,&rdquo; she says eventually, because it&rsquo;s as good a subject change as any.</p><p>Konstantin grunts in agreement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll<i> need </i>a new name, seeing as you&rsquo;re now legally deceased.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to give me one?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s probably how these things work. They pick codenames for their assets, or whatever. Oksana watches Konstantin a little skeptically and thinks that maybe this could be some kind of bullshit psychological indicator of how he sees her, if she wanted it to be.</p><p>But Konstantin only shakes his head, smiling faintly still. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he tells her. &ldquo;You are the one who ought to choose.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><b><br /></b>There are now several important organizations who most definitely want Villanelle dead. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s pretty sure it should count as some kind of accomplishment.<b><br /></b></p><p>She&rsquo;s less immediately concerned about MI6 - those idiots took years to find her, and that was only with Eve&rsquo;s help - and a little more concerned with the Twelve. They know her patterns, and many of her tricks, but what they do not know is that she is alive. They&rsquo;ll find all the blood in her apartment, the knife, and they&rsquo;ll have to wonder. At least for a little while.</p><p>It gives her a little time to recover. When she does, she can go looking for <i>them</i>.</p><p>The thing is, Villanelle is not very good at recovery.<b><br /></b></p><p>She finds an off-duty surgeon to stitch her up and can&rsquo;t risk reopening her injury to kill him afterwards, so she supposes she&rsquo;ll have to pray he doesn&rsquo;t run his mouth. Not that it matters, in the very brief time it takes her to disappear afterwards. But holeing herself up in one shitty hotel room after another gives her much too much time to think.</p><p>And she doesn&rsquo;t want to think. Not about Eve, for once, not right now. And not about Konstantin, who may or may not have survived the shot she&rsquo;d fired at him (she hadn&rsquo;t been aiming to kill, not quite, but there are too many variables in play for her to know whether that really matters).</p><p>As a bleak alternative, then, she thinks for a little while about Anna.</p><p>Anna.</p><p>Villanelle had missed her for a very long time. Now she knows it would have been better if they&rsquo;d never seen each other again.</p><p>She can&rsquo;t work out which of the things she&rsquo;d said to Anna were lies, and which were the truth. That happens sometimes. Villanelle spins things to get under people&rsquo;s skin, and sometimes ends up losing track of it all herself. She knows that when Anna had been pointing a gun at her, it had felt good to tell her that she no longer loved her. Like Anna would actually care. She knows that when she had her own gun in her hand, and had told Anna that she could shoot her, it had felt like the truth in the moment. </p><p>But she&rsquo;d never pulled the trigger. So now she would never know.<b><br /></b></p><p>Villanelle begrudgingly supposes that maybe Anna deserved to deprive her of that.</p><p>But it isn&rsquo;t fair that she can&rsquo;t get the images out of her head; Anna&rsquo;s gun pressed against her own throat, Anna crumpling as the shot rang out, all that blood soaking into the floor. Villanelle has long since stopped being fazed by violence, of course, so she doesn&rsquo;t know why this stays with her. As if Anna hasn&rsquo;t haunted her for long enough.</p><p>Villanelle knows she didn&rsquo;t pull the trigger, but she also knows it&rsquo;s still her fault. What she doesn&rsquo;t know is how she feels about that. Things she doesn&rsquo;t know how to name bubble in her chest unpleasantly, but really, it&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish that from the continuous ache of the knife wound in her side. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the same in the end.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a pen and a notepad on the bedside table of the hotel room. Villanelle contemplates them for a few moments. Wonders if she could still write pretty, flowing French words in pretty, flowing letters, and pretend that one day Anna would still read them.</p><p>She almost tries it. Pretending would make all of this much simpler. &nbsp;But in the end, she doesn&rsquo;t know what she would say, and the truth is, Villanelle doesn&rsquo;t really want to think about this either.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s been two months since Eve stuck her with a knife. Villanelle thinks that seems fair. Fitting payback, to just let Eve <i>wonder</i> whether she&rsquo;s alive or dead for two whole months.<b><br /></b></p><p>She suspects it&rsquo;s kept Eve up at night, which is both amusing and intriguing. Villanelle hadn&rsquo;t thought Eve would stab her, and then when Eve had, Villanelle hadn&rsquo;t thought she&rsquo;d feel bad about it afterwards. But Eve, Villanelle thinks, might never stop surprising her. She can&rsquo;t imagine a world in which she&rsquo;d ever find Eve <i>boring</i>. Maybe occasionally predictable, but only long enough to lull Villanelle into thinking she knows what Eve is about to do, until she doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s missed her, really.<b><br /></b></p><p>When she does decide to pay Eve a little reunion visit, it&rsquo;s almost disconcertingly easy to track her down. She is no longer living with her husband (something which Villanelle is not particularly lamenting), but alone in a flat on the other side of London. If Villanelle had wanted to flatter herself, she might have speculated that Eve <i>wants</i> her to find her. Which is a nice thought, and all, except that Villanelle isn&rsquo;t the only person Eve needed to be concerned about.</p><p>So when Eve comes home one night, shoulders half-slumped with a kind of recognizable exhaustion, Villanelle is leisurely sprawled across her couch, and the first conversational thing she says is, &ldquo;If I were one of the Twelve, you&rsquo;d be dead. Just like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve drops her bag and <i>screams</i>, and Villanelle rolls her eyes, because really, aren&rsquo;t they past this by now?</p><p>&ldquo;Not upping your chances,&rdquo; she adds, not bothering to sit up.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;You &ndash;&rdquo; &nbsp;Eve sputters after a shell-shocked moment. Villanelle expects her to continue, Eve can&rsquo;t seem to find the words.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you forget my name already?&rdquo; &nbsp;Villanelle feigns a hurt expression. &ldquo;A girl would think you&rsquo;d already moved on to some other immensely talented, incredibly attractive international assassin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You &ndash;&rdquo; &nbsp;Eve tries again &ldquo; &ndash; <i>fucking</i> asshole!&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle has to try not to laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;Close enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were <i>dead</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Did she? <i>Really</i>? Villanelle isn&rsquo;t sure whether she ought to be insulted or not. She smirks a little, all the same. &ldquo;You sound very upset about it. Did you miss me that much?&rdquo;</p><p>Eve does not look impressed, however. Eve still looks somewhere between shocked and angry and &ndash; something else Villanelle can&rsquo;t identify. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where the hell have you<i> been </i>all this time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Recovering.&rdquo; Villanelle shrugs slightly. &ldquo;It takes a while, when you&rsquo;ve been stabbed in all your&hellip; vital organs. Your fault, if you didn&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; Does Eve really have any room to blame her for not telling her where she was?<br /></p><p>Disregarding the bag she dropped on the floor, Eve keeps her eyes fixed on Villanelle, almost disbelievingly. Ignoring the strange, apprehensive pull in her chest, Villanelle feigns laziness as she watches Eve move tentatively a little closer. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t &ndash; um &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle smiles at her slightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;You meant to.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>There&rsquo;s a stiff pause.</p><p>&ldquo;Well. I&rsquo;m still sorry. I guess I didn&rsquo;t really realize that I &ndash; that you &ndash; I&rsquo;m just sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>If Villanelle&rsquo;s being honest with herself, she didn&rsquo;t really expect an apology. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s blunt and almost strangled, and Villanelle thinks she should probably respond by telling Eve any of the things she&rsquo;s been feeling about it since the last time they saw each other. But it&rsquo;s one of those complicated things. Hard to put into words. Some strange mixture of betrayal and hurt and intrigue and an almost tender kind of pride.</p><p>&ldquo;I have this really crazy scar now,&rdquo; Villanelle tells her instead of any of those things. &ldquo;I kind of like it. Want to see?&rdquo;</p><p>Eve pales a little, but still manages to roll her eyes. &ldquo;Oh, shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like you don&rsquo;t want me to take my shirt off.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve snorts, and for a moment some of the tension between them seems to dissipate. But only for a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you&hellip; here because you want revenge?&rdquo; It sounds oddly dramatic spoken aloud, and Eve scrunches her nose awkwardly. &ldquo;Or something?&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle&rsquo;s thought about it, of course. Long enough to know what the answer is. &nbsp;&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think stabbing you would make me feel any better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s. Uh. Good.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle gives her a twitch of a smile, and, surprising her slightly yet again, Eve returns it carefully. Villanelle does sit up a little then, instinctively drawing her legs up to her chest, and Eve gingerly sits down on the other side of the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;So.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> you here for?&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle is a little taken aback that Eve doesn&rsquo;t know the answer to that question &ndash; until she realizes she&rsquo;s not really sure she knows it herself. She shrugs lightly again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Eve agrees slowly, searching Villanelle&rsquo;s face for &ndash; something. Villanelle isn&rsquo;t sure what. &ldquo;I &ndash;&rdquo; But again, she cuts off, and Villanelle&rsquo;s smile turns a little more lofty.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left you quite speechless, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&hellip; have to say, I. Wasn&rsquo;t expecting you to just. I mean. I thought you were <i>dead</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said. With that exact inflection.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve nudges her leg with her foot, a gesture that feels oddly casual and familiar, given that Villanelle can count the number of times they&rsquo;ve been alone together on one hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;Can you take this seriously for a second? Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous for you to be here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Villanelle replies automatically &ndash; and then backtracks at a sudden realization. &ldquo;&ndash; I mean. I made sure I wasn&rsquo;t followed, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re worried about. You&rsquo;re not in any more danger than you were just &ndash; hanging out in some minimum security apartment in London.&rdquo;</p><p>Eve looks less sheepish than she would have expected. Of course, this is the woman who&rsquo;d set her iPhone password to &lsquo;1-2-3-4&rsquo;. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of running. I figured if the Twelve really wanted me, then just &ndash; fuck it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s smart,&rdquo; Villanelle notes sarcastically.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t have a job, or a husband, or a&hellip; purpose anymore. I thought you were &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; Villanelle finishes for her, a little softer. She considers for a moment, because maybe she wants Eve to be a lot of things, but not unhappy. Not &ndash; haphazardly disinterested in her own survival, though she suspects a part of that is just Eve playing it up. &ldquo;Well, now you know that I&rsquo;m not. So you will have to tough it out a little while longer, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; Eve agrees, a little more wry, still watching her closely. &nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;What are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like, <i>now </i>now?&rdquo; Villanelle pretends to think. &nbsp;&ldquo;What is this, like, our third date? So &ndash;&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, you know what I mean,&rdquo; Eve cuts in, though Villanelle takes a small amount of satisfaction in seeing that she&rsquo;s flushed a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Right. That.&rdquo; &nbsp;Villanelle raises her eyebrows, vaguely mysterious. &nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s still your job to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Eve reminds her. &ldquo;I was fired.&rdquo;</p><p>Villanelle isn&rsquo;t fooled for a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;And so you are just&hellip; giving up?&rdquo;</p><p>Eve meets her gaze for a heartbeat &ndash; and then sort of laughs. &ldquo;Not on your life.&rdquo;</p><p>She looks less tired than she did when she came in, sounds more alive. There&rsquo;s a certain spark in her eyes, and Villanelle finds she&rsquo;s missed that, too. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she retorts almost affectionately, and then abruptly rises from the couch. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then consider this your pep talk, or whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait &ndash;&rdquo; Eve straightens a little, seeming taken aback. &nbsp;&ldquo;&ndash; That&rsquo;s it? You&rsquo;re leaving?</p><p>Villanelle pauses. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why?
