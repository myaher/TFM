I know it may seem I&rsquo;m saying this because I&rsquo;m pretty much one of the hardest Phan shippers out there, but&hellip;if you think about it, it&rsquo;s clear. Dan and Phil, are in a relationship. They are either dating, or married if you want to think that far. I don&rsquo;t know why it hadnt seemed more obvious to me earlier. But&hellip;it makes sense. You see, Dan and Phil, have never, ever, ever, ever, ever, mentioned that they were looking for a date, or looking for someone in general. They&rsquo;ve always just been&hellip;Dan and Phil. Neither of them have talked about going on dates with anyone ( except back in high school or junior high ). We&rsquo;ve never seen them in public kissing someone, or being &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; for a relationship. Because&hellip;looking for relationships were never on their mind. Why?? Because they already have one. With eachother. And&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always had a feeling that, they just aren&rsquo;t going to make &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; videos, or a &ldquo;relationship announcement&rdquo; vid. They just&hellip;live. They don&rsquo;t just tell the world &ldquo;hey we&rsquo;re dating&rdquo;. I mean&hellip;to be honest, if I was a YouTuber, and was in a relationship&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d actually talk about it. It may seem weird, but&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t want everything to revolve around my relationship. I&rsquo;d just want a channel, and then to live life normally. I mean&hellip;you don&rsquo;t randomly tell someone who your uncle is. So why randomly tell who your partner is. I&rsquo;m not against open relationships or anything, I just think that, maybe I&rsquo;d just want to keep that out of the main picture. Personal. Because if Dan and Phil &ldquo;announced&rdquo; their relationship, then everyone would start asking them to do couple tags, relationship videos, the chapstick challenge&hellip;etc. And as you know, Dan and Phil just don&rsquo;t seem like the kind of people that would do that. I think they want to keep their relationship simple and private. And I hate to say this, but&hellip;.damn, I support that. They love eachother so much, that they aren&rsquo;t going to let themselves use eachother for views or clicks or more subs. They just want to live, be in love, and enjoy their careers together, like they always have. And&hellip;.the hiatus makes even more sense now that I&rsquo;m saying this. I mean think about it. World tour for a whole year. In front of fans. Gaming videos imbetween. In front of fans. Editing their film. For the fans. Pinof 10. In front of and for the fans. Hons&hellip;.they just want time. Since their relationship isnt a video title or clickbait,\u00a0 they want to spend time together, and live out their relationship like they desire. Just no cameras for now. They&rsquo;re living life. In love. Yes, in a relationship. Might I add that by now, they would&rsquo;ve said something about their connection if it wasn&rsquo;t a relationship. Dan and Phil aren&rsquo;t ones to keep things under the radar.Dan even opened up about his Depression. And they&rsquo;re technically opening up about their relationship, but in a way that is slower, and less obvious, so it doesn&rsquo;t capture too much attention. So&hellip;if this hiatus really makes you as sad as it did for me, remember, as I have now, that this is only helping these two grow closer, and really express the appreciation they have of eachother, that they&rsquo;ve possesed for such a long time~ Nine and a half years~ So&hellip;please.

I know it may seem I\u2019m saying this because I\u2019m pretty much one of the hardest Phan shippers out there, but\u2026if you think about it, it\u2019s clear. Dan and Phil, are in a relationship. They are either dating, or married if you want to think that far. I don\u2019t know why it hadnt seemed more obvious to me earlier. But\u2026it makes sense. You see, Dan and Phil, have never, ever, ever, ever, ever, mentioned that they were looking for a date, or looking for someone in general. They\u2019ve always just been\u2026Dan and Phil. Neither of them have talked about going on dates with anyone ( except back in high school or junior high ). We\u2019ve never seen them in public kissing someone, or being \u201cexposed\u201d for a relationship. Because\u2026looking for relationships were never on their mind. Why?? Because they already have one. With eachother. And\u2026 I\u2019ve always had a feeling that, they just aren\u2019t going to make \u201ccoming out\u201d videos, or a \u201crelationship announcement\u201d vid. They just\u2026live. They don\u2019t just tell the world \u201chey we\u2019re dating\u201d. I mean\u2026to be honest, if I was a YouTuber, and was in a relationship\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019d actually talk about it. It may seem weird, but\u2026I wouldn\u2019t want everything to revolve around my relationship. I\u2019d just want a channel, and then to live life normally. I mean\u2026you don\u2019t randomly tell someone who your uncle is. So why randomly tell who your partner is. I\u2019m not against open relationships or anything, I just think that, maybe I\u2019d just want to keep that out of the main picture. Personal. Because if Dan and Phil \u201cannounced\u201d their relationship, then everyone would start asking them to do couple tags, relationship videos, the chapstick challenge\u2026etc. And as you know, Dan and Phil just don\u2019t seem like the kind of people that would do that. I think they want to keep their relationship simple and private. And I hate to say this, but\u2026.damn, I support that. They love eachother so much, that they aren\u2019t going to let themselves use eachother for views or clicks or more subs. They just want to live, be in love, and enjoy their careers together, like they always have. And\u2026.the hiatus makes even more sense now that I\u2019m saying this. I mean think about it. World tour for a whole year. In front of fans. Gaming videos imbetween. In front of fans. Editing their film. For the fans. Pinof 10. In front of and for the fans. Hons\u2026.they just want time. Since their relationship isnt a video title or clickbait,\u00a0 they want to spend time together, and live out their relationship like they desire. Just no cameras for now. They\u2019re living life. In love. Yes, in a relationship. Might I add that by now, they would\u2019ve said something about their connection if it wasn\u2019t a relationship. Dan and Phil aren\u2019t ones to keep things under the radar.Dan even opened up about his Depression. And they\u2019re technically opening up about their relationship, but in a way that is slower, and less obvious, so it doesn\u2019t capture too much attention. So\u2026if this hiatus really makes you as sad as it did for me, remember, as I have now, that this is only helping these two grow closer, and really express the appreciation they have of eachother, that they\u2019ve possesed for such a long time~ Nine and a half years~ So\u2026please. Respect Dan. Respect Phil. Respect their lives. Respect their privacy.Yes, I\u2019m sure they are in a relationship.But that\u2019s their life. <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">And</span> <span class=\"npf_color_monica\">they\u2019re</span> <span class=\"npf_color_ross\">living</span> <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">it~</span></p><h1>\ud83d\udc9b</h1><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"720\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7396a788cb3fb6b2045d2062f6661e54/tumblr_pqcpp8SoUz1wayw2l_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"720\"></figure></p>",
