        "body": "<h1>Patience</h1><p><i>Thank you for all the support. It means the world for me. N.x</i></p><p>\u201cCould I ask you a question, please?\u201d A humming sound was the answer for me. His eyes which were covered with a pair of glasses looked down upon a thick and old book, his hair was messy, yet freshly cut from yesterday.</p><p>As I was staring at him in dead silence, something melancholic caught me. I couldn\u2019t really figure out what it indicated. However, a question that had been haunting me for a long time now came back to my mind. It quickly persuaded me to formulate words. So, I hesitantly did prepare him &ndash; or rather myself with another question. Then a long silence came again, now with his attention on me waiting and expecting.</p><p>I took a glance at his huge yellow old T-shirt, and under that piece of clothing his tummy made an appearance. My hands itched to caress him immediately, but for this serious aura that suddenly created itself I stayed still in my place. Because of my anxiety I started picking my nails, my heart began beating faster, and my lungs felt as if they were squished.</p><p>Harry furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, his eyes filled with worry. He put his book away, went closer to me, to the point I felt his sweatpants covered knees beside mine. His skin felt smooth when he grabbed my hands with his, and the way his thumbs stroked me gently really did calm me a little bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, love? You know, you can tell me anything, I\u2019m all ears for you. Always,\u201d his voice was smooth and quiet, almost a whisper. It felt as though it also got more hoarse.</p><p>From outside, this weather with sudden warmness and sunshine due to spring brought us birds and insects back that were hiding throughout all winter &ndash; and all those lively creatures sang some songs. One of those songs were heard at that moment, and I was pretty sure about the fact that it was that specific bird who had came back repeatedly for a few weeks at that point. The little bird liked to sit on our tree which was the closest to our backdoor with glass. We could see it resting, and both of the bird and us were thrilled. For different reasons, but it was the same feeling.</p><p>Now was the first time that small creature brought me something else, though. Something that I also couldn\u2019t name, only could tell that it left me with deeper peace.</p><p>This is why I chose braveness.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I sighed a little bit after that, then continued on while burning under his focused gaze on me, \u201cI have seen a sneaky photo of you and Camille when you two had dinner the other day, and although I knew about the whole thing, and honestly I felt okay with it before the picture, because I trust you, I-I couldn\u2019t help this uncomfortable feeling which created itself in my heart. And,\u201d another sigh, more nervous lip biting and shaky breaths &ndash; I felt like a child with my small and weak voice, and with the way I was avoiding eye contact, \u201cYou know how I am like. I-I can\u2019t stop my brain from wondering &ndash; overthinking everything, so, fuck&hellip;\u201d I felt stupid for making this seem so hard and painful when it was such an unnecessary problem of mine. It wasn\u2019t really a problem, rather a turmoil in my stomach which didn\u2019t want to go away easily. I was afraid of having this feeling all the time &ndash; until Harry chooses to leave me, because he gets fed up with my anxious and possessive behaviour. I jumped a bit when his hands squeezed mine to show me support. I really appreciated that small gesture, and beside my panic that made my heart heavy, I felt a sudden warmness spread around me. It was refreshing.</p><p>So I dared to continue on &ndash; again.</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t help wondering about your strength,\u201d Harry was more confused than before when I stated this, I noticed that immediately. If it was a different situation, I\u2019d have giggled at the way he furrowed his eyebrows and pouted his lips like a lost puppy begging you to take her/him home with you.</p><p>When this comparison reached me, I couldn\u2019t help myself: my head in between his neck and his left shoulder with his calming smell and soft skin intoxicating me seemed very promising, so that\u2019s what I did. Then I felt him vibrating under me, because an amused chuckle left him while his left hand started caressing the top of my head where my hair bun took place. It apparently annoyed him in a way, because he made my hair unbound, falling down on to my back freely. My fast heartbeat began to slow down gradually.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, love?\u201d And his baritone which was lower than usual had me sigh in content in his close presence.</p><p>I almost forgot to answer until a long pause came, along with a realisation about the quick silence. My voice was muffled due to the fact that I nuzzled my face into his neck completely.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you do it&hellip; How you manage to stay friends with people who hurt you when you loved them in a romantic way before. Can\u2019t help wondering what would happen if you got bored of me.\u201d</p><p>A high squeak left my mouth when he grabbed me by my jaw to look him in the eyes. His gaze was harsh, yet soft &ndash; and all of this contrast confused and impressed me. It was a look that I had never experienced before, even from him. As if I hurt him, but he knew that I couldn\u2019t help feeling insecure on many occasions. However, he always repeated himself without any signs of annoyance: he loves me, he is the lucky one, he will always be there for me.</p><p>But what if he won\u2019t? What if he was just one of those people who I had met in the past whose promises still ached my heart?</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d I had never seen him talk this way before either. He almost looked threatening with his gritting teeth and something which hid away in the back of his throat, holding it back, because he knew it was damaging, \u201cYou mean everything to me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes started tearing up, and mine followed. Both of our eyes filled up with tears, and for a moment I thought: how strange we could seem from an outsider\u2019s perspective. Two people crying because they love each other in a film must be something that anyone would say \u201cew\u201d to, yet those mushy and unrealistic scenes in a romantic movie would also make everyone desire for something close to that fulfilling connection &ndash; a relationship as well.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me, love,\u201d he kept holding my jaw, his grip loosened, yet it was still tight, as if he felt desperate &ndash; desperate for something which I couldn\u2019t name. Maybe he strongly wished he could show proofs &ndash; signs of those feelings that hid away deep in his throat.</p><p>He spoke again after some long and comfortable moments of silence.</p><p>\u201cI stay friends with people who I was in a relationship before, because I am desperate, hun. That\u2019s it. I am desperate in a way which makes me still hold on to old memories and promises, because sometimes I get so lonely, I feel like I\u2019m the only one in this world &ndash; in this bubble inside this world where I watch everyone else connect and fall in love and get married, then have kids, and,\u201d a heavy sigh followed,\u201d I might have always despised this way of thinking: growing up only to reach regular purposes that have been already reached before by billions of people, but I am still human. I still have \u201cingrained reflexes\u201d, we could say. So I always said: fuck it! If I can\u2019t have real romantic love, because something must be wrong with me, why not hold on to friendships? Sometimes friends are more loyal than your own significant other, because there are no specific rules and expectations: you are just you, and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just rambling now,\u201d he excused himself, stood up with heavy limbs and heart, he took deep breaths and rubbed his face in frustration.</p><p>I let him cool down, be on his own for some time. Meanwhile, he stayed inside our bedroom upstairs, I hysterically tried finding tasks around the house: hoovering, mopping, washing the dishes, putting many neglected dirty clothes in the washing machine, watering our collection of plants, scrubbing the windows, the coffee table, everything, even if something didn\u2019t even have any little spots. Every now and then the guilt in me got so bad, I stopped for a few moments and let myself cry for a while.</p><p>That whole day was incredibly strange. And lonely. Mostly confusing. We didn\u2019t fight properly or in any way possible, yet it still felt like it. I knew I made Harry sad without meaning to, and I was stuck in this powerless situation.</p><p>I had never been good at talking &ndash; communicating about serious issues had always created bigger anxiety inside me, so I avoided it with all my will.</p><p>However, I knew I needed to force myself for just once finally.</p><p>With wobbly legs, I tried repeating to myself that it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just Harry &ndash; the man who is always so accepting and understanding and kind. Someone who says I love you until he shushes my insecure thoughts. Someone who always buys extra fruit, because he knows I could eat tons of them, stating stuffs like it only benefits him: seeing my eyes light up in genuine happiness makes him happy, too.</p><p>I thought about all the times he hugged me without asking anything, because he just knew that something was wrong, and that I needed him. I thought about the way he puts everyone ahead of himself, to the point he completely ignores his own needs. He wants everyone happy, because that helps his sadness.</p><p>This thing felt familiar. Maybe this is one of the things why we found each other somehow, and in that moment when millions of memories flashed before my eyes while I was climbing up those stairs, my love grew towards him &ndash; it was something that I thought was impossible to happen before. My heart could have exploded, for a few moments I needed to remind myself that this is reality, that this is my present. Having one good person to love and to be loved by in life is really enough.</p><p>Our bedroom door creaked, and that high-pitched sound startled him, it was obvious when he jerked his head up fast with big eyes and messy hair. The silk blanket covered up every inch of his body, even half of his face: I could only see his mentioned hair and eyes, and his cute nose.</p><p>He was in a small mood. This meant that he really needed to be held and cuddled, told that I love him and that he is amazing, it was no stranger occurrence. Like now he got grumbly and pouty, very impatient and just inseparable from me. The fact that he still wanted me in his vulnerable state relaxed me.</p><p>I smiled at him gently, took calm steps towards his open arms.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, love, it feels lonely without you in here,\u201d half lidded eyes and a cosy lilac jumper described his being in that moment, along with his begging voice.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Harry. Genuinely,\u201d I mumbled into the back of his neck while I held him tightly from behind. Our legs tangled, our hearts undisturbed, and the sadness went away. My words held honest feelings.</p><p>\u201cI know. I love you, too,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>For now this was enough. Baby steps are the key to success, I reminded myself. This could work out &ndash; everything works out in the end.</p>",

N.x</i></p><p>\u201cCould I ask you a question, please?\u201d A humming sound was the answer for me. His eyes which were covered with a pair of glasses looked down upon a thick and old book, his hair was messy, yet freshly cut from yesterday.</p><p>As I was staring at him in dead silence, something melancholic caught me. I couldn\u2019t really figure out what it indicated. However, a question that had been haunting me for a long time now came back to my mind. It quickly persuaded me to formulate words. So, I hesitantly did prepare him \u2013 or rather myself with another question. Then a long silence came again, now with his attention on me waiting and expecting.</p><p>I took a glance at his huge yellow old T-shirt, and under that piece of clothing his tummy made an appearance. My hands itched to caress him immediately, but for this serious aura that suddenly created itself I stayed still in my place. Because of my anxiety I started picking my nails, my heart began beating faster, and my lungs felt as if they were squished.</p><p>Harry furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, his eyes filled with worry. He put his book away, went closer to me, to the point I felt his sweatpants covered knees beside mine. His skin felt smooth when he grabbed my hands with his, and the way his thumbs stroked me gently really did calm me a little bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, love? You know, you can tell me anything, I\u2019m all ears for you. Always,\u201d his voice was smooth and quiet, almost a whisper. It felt as though it also got more hoarse.</p><p>From outside, this weather with sudden warmness and sunshine due to spring brought us birds and insects back that were hiding throughout all winter \u2013 and all those lively creatures sang some songs. One of those songs were heard at that moment, and I was pretty sure about the fact that it was that specific bird who had came back repeatedly for a few weeks at that point. The little bird liked to sit on our tree which was the closest to our backdoor with glass. We could see it resting, and both of the bird and us were thrilled. For different reasons, but it was the same feeling.</p><p>Now was the first time that small creature brought me something else, though. Something that I also couldn\u2019t name, only could tell that it left me with deeper peace.</p><p>This is why I chose braveness.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I sighed a little bit after that, then continued on while burning under his focused gaze on me, \u201cI have seen a sneaky photo of you and Camille when you two had dinner the other day, and although I knew about the whole thing, and honestly I felt okay with it before the picture, because I trust you, I-I couldn\u2019t help this uncomfortable feeling which created itself in my heart. And,\u201d another sigh, more nervous lip biting and shaky breaths \u2013 I felt like a child with my small and weak voice, and with the way I was avoiding eye contact, \u201cYou know how I am like. I-I can\u2019t stop my brain from wondering \u2013 overthinking everything, so, fuck\u2026\u201d I felt stupid for making this seem so hard and painful when it was such an unnecessary problem of mine. It wasn\u2019t really a problem, rather a turmoil in my stomach which didn\u2019t want to go away easily. I was afraid of having this feeling all the time \u2013 until Harry chooses to leave me, because he gets fed up with my anxious and possessive behaviour. I jumped a bit when his hands squeezed mine to show me support. I really appreciated that small gesture, and beside my panic that made my heart heavy, I felt a sudden warmness spread around me. It was refreshing.</p><p>So I dared to continue on \u2013 again.</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t help wondering about your strength,\u201d Harry was more confused than before when I stated this, I noticed that immediately. If it was a different situation, I\u2019d have giggled at the way he furrowed his eyebrows and pouted his lips like a lost puppy begging you to take her/him home with you.</p><p>When this comparison reached me, I couldn\u2019t help myself: my head in between his neck and his left shoulder with his calming smell and soft skin intoxicating me seemed very promising, so that\u2019s what I did. Then I felt him vibrating under me, because an amused chuckle left him while his left hand started caressing the top of my head where my hair bun took place. It apparently annoyed him in a way, because he made my hair unbound, falling down on to my back freely. My fast heartbeat began to slow down gradually.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, love?\u201d And his baritone which was lower than usual had me sigh in content in his close presence.</p><p>I almost forgot to answer until a long pause came, along with a realisation about the quick silence. My voice was muffled due to the fact that I nuzzled my face into his neck completely.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you do it\u2026 How you manage to stay friends with people who hurt you when you loved them in a romantic way before. Can\u2019t help wondering what would happen if you got bored of me.\u201d</p><p>A high squeak left my mouth when he grabbed me by my jaw to look him in the eyes. His gaze was harsh, yet soft \u2013 and all of this contrast confused and impressed me. It was a look that I had never experienced before, even from him. As if I hurt him, but he knew that I couldn\u2019t help feeling insecure on many occasions. However, he always repeated himself without any signs of annoyance: he loves me, he is the lucky one, he will always be there for me.</p><p>But what if he won\u2019t? What if he was just one of those people who I had met in the past whose promises still ached my heart?</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d I had never seen him talk this way before either. He almost looked threatening with his gritting teeth and something which hid away in the back of his throat, holding it back, because he knew it was damaging, \u201cYou mean everything to me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes started tearing up, and mine followed. Both of our eyes filled up with tears, and for a moment I thought: how strange we could seem from an outsider\u2019s perspective. Two people crying because they love each other in a film must be something that anyone would say \u201cew\u201d to, yet those mushy and unrealistic scenes in a romantic movie would also make everyone desire for something close to that fulfilling connection \u2013 a relationship as well.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me, love,\u201d he kept holding my jaw, his grip loosened, yet it was still tight, as if he felt desperate \u2013 desperate for something which I couldn\u2019t name. Maybe he strongly wished he could show proofs \u2013 signs of those feelings that hid away deep in his throat.</p><p>He spoke again after some long and comfortable moments of silence.</p><p>\u201cI stay friends with people who I was in a relationship before, because I am desperate, hun. That\u2019s it. I am desperate in a way which makes me still hold on to old memories and promises, because sometimes I get so lonely, I feel like I\u2019m the only one in this world \u2013 in this bubble inside this world where I watch everyone else connect and fall in love and get married, then have kids, and,\u201d a heavy sigh followed,\u201d I might have always despised this way of thinking: growing up only to reach regular purposes that have been already reached before by billions of people, but I am still human. I still have \u201cingrained reflexes\u201d, we could say. So I always said: fuck it! If I can\u2019t have real romantic love, because something must be wrong with me, why not hold on to friendships? Sometimes friends are more loyal than your own significant other, because there are no specific rules and expectations: you are just you, and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just rambling now,\u201d he excused himself, stood up with heavy limbs and heart, he took deep breaths and rubbed his face in frustration.</p><p>I let him cool down, be on his own for some time. Meanwhile, he stayed inside our bedroom upstairs, I hysterically tried finding tasks around the house: hoovering, mopping, washing the dishes, putting many neglected dirty clothes in the washing machine, watering our collection of plants, scrubbing the windows, the coffee table, everything, even if something didn\u2019t even have any little spots. Every now and then the guilt in me got so bad, I stopped for a few moments and let myself cry for a while.</p><p>That whole day was incredibly strange. And lonely. Mostly confusing. We didn\u2019t fight properly or in any way possible, yet it still felt like it. I knew I made Harry sad without meaning to, and I was stuck in this powerless situation.</p><p>I had never been good at talking \u2013 communicating about serious issues had always created bigger anxiety inside me, so I avoided it with all my will.</p><p>However, I knew I needed to force myself for just once finally.</p><p>With wobbly legs, I tried repeating to myself that it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just Harry \u2013 the man who is always so accepting and understanding and kind. Someone who says I love you until he shushes my insecure thoughts. Someone who always buys extra fruit, because he knows I could eat tons of them, stating stuffs like it only benefits him: seeing my eyes light up in genuine happiness makes him happy, too.</p><p>I thought about all the times he hugged me without asking anything, because he just knew that something was wrong, and that I needed him. I thought about the way he puts everyone ahead of himself, to the point he completely ignores his own needs. He wants everyone happy, because that helps his sadness.</p><p>This thing felt familiar. Maybe this is one of the things why we found each other somehow, and in that moment when millions of memories flashed before my eyes while I was climbing up those stairs, my love grew towards him \u2013 it was something that I thought was impossible to happen before. My heart could have exploded, for a few moments I needed to remind myself that this is reality, that this is my present. Having one good person to love and to be loved by in life is really enough.</p><p>Our bedroom door creaked, and that high-pitched sound startled him, it was obvious when he jerked his head up fast with big eyes and messy hair. The silk blanket covered up every inch of his body, even half of his face: I could only see his mentioned hair and eyes, and his cute nose.</p><p>He was in a small mood. This meant that he really needed to be held and cuddled, told that I love him and that he is amazing, it was no stranger occurrence. Like now he got grumbly and pouty, very impatient and just inseparable from me. The fact that he still wanted me in his vulnerable state relaxed me.</p><p>I smiled at him gently, took calm steps towards his open arms.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, love, it feels lonely without you in here,\u201d half lidded eyes and a cosy lilac jumper described his being in that moment, along with his begging voice.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Harry. Genuinely,\u201d I mumbled into the back of his neck while I held him tightly from behind. Our legs tangled, our hearts undisturbed, and the sadness went away. My words held honest feelings.</p><p>\u201cI know. I love you, too,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>For now this was enough. Baby steps are the key to success, I reminded myself. This could work out \u2013 everything works out in the end.</p></p>",
