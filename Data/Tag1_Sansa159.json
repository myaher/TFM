So every Stark who lost a wolf didn't live. Then I saw someone suggest Sansa will die in the same way as her wolf - sacrificing herself for Arya. This really scares me because I can totally see it happening. On top of that, Maisie posted a \"Last woman standing\" on her Insta awhile ago. I can't watch if Sansa dies. What do you think?",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>I could give you a very long answer to this, but I just alert you to a series by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173567788277/lady-and-the-ghost-part-1\">here, here </a>and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173701172447/lady-and-the-ghost-part-3\">here). <br/></a></p><p>But to give you also a short answer: If Lady\u2019s death was a foreshadowing of Sansa\u2019s death you would have to ask, how she survived 7 seasons without Lady, when Robb and Grey Wind died almost simultaneously. <br/></p><p>The death of Lady has several reasons, some of them are Doylist reasons, some of them in-world. Lady is buried in Winterfell and this is an early hint that Sansa will return to Winterfell and that this is her home. Bran awakes after Lady is killed. This might be an example of magic, of \u2018death pays for life\u2019. It is hinted at in the books just be the order of how things happen, in the show it is heavily hinted at, because at the end of episode 2, Bran opens his eyes the moment Lady dies. In a way, Sansa\u2019s arc is also about the death of her inner lady, the trusting child that thought \u201clife is a song.\u201d Sansa sheds this persona with every further step she takes until she will be a Queen, but she won\u2019t have lost her kindness and other \u2018ladylike\u2019 characteristics.It is more of a transformation from Lady to Queen than a full-blown change.<br/></p><p>From a doylist perspective Lady needs to die so that Sansa won\u2019t have a protector in King\u2019s Landing and her death is used by GRRM to drive a wedge between her and her sister and to alienate Sansa from her father. It is also a means to show us, how dangerous Cersei is. I think Lady\u2019s death is also a means to hide the fact that Sansa has some magic of her own. I\u2019m not sure I believe the theory that part of Lady lives on in her, but I am certain that Sansa has the magic of singing. This will be very important once she reunites with Jon in the books, as I have explained in my Beren and Luthien meta (here is the link to the <a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/171595236550/tolkien-and-grrm-the-tale-of-beren-and-luthien\">third part</a>) and my meta on \u201csingers singing songs\u201d (the part on Sansa is <a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/173800407095/singers-singing-songs-and-their-impact-on\">here</a>). <br/></p><p>So, there are in-world and doylist reasons for Lady\u2019s death and none of them are connected to Sansa dying. People who predict Sansa\u2019s death are usually people who are still stuck in the opininon they shaped from Arya\u2019s first chapters in AGOT - chapters that strongly convey the \u2018Cinderella\u2019s awful step-sisters\u2019 vibes, and that are misleading the readers. This leads them to the opinion that Sansa somehow \u2018has to pay\u2019 and consequently sacrifice herself for Arya. You wouldn\u2019t believe some of the punishments Sansa haters manage to come up with! Sacrificing herself for Arya is one of the nicer ones\u2026. As if there weren\u2019t many, many much more nasty people in ASOIAF that GRRM would waste his time to punish one sister for the squabbles of children.<br/></p><p>I don\u2019t believe that there is even the slightest chance that this will happen. Sansa is not the mean step-sister, but only readers who are ready to read her chapters carefully can disentangle themselves from the tropes GRRM cleverly put into place in AGOT.</p><p>No, Sansa and Arya will live:</p><blockquote><p>\nThe night the bird had come \nfrom Winterfell, Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle \ngodswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the \nriver. The heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown\n with smokeberry vines; they knelt before it to offer their \nthanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as \nthe moon rose, Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under \nNed\u2019s cloak. All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone. When dawn\n broke over the city, the dark red blooms of dragon\u2019s breath surrounded \nthe girls where they lay. \u201cI dreamed of Bran,\u201d Sansa had whispered to \nhim. \u201cI saw him smiling.\u201d\n \u00a0\u00a0 (AGOT, Eddard V).</p></blockquote><p>After the long Night, Sansa and Arya will be alive, Bran probably as well, even though maybe he\u2019ll be a tree ofr in some \u2018dream\u2019 situation, and maybe even Jon will live (dragon\u2019s breath). <br/></p><p>I hope to have dispelled your doubts!<br/></p><p>Thanks for the ask and thanks for the compliments!<br/></p>",

In a way, Sansa\u2019s arc is also about the death of her inner lady, the trusting child that thought \u201clife is a song.\u201d Sansa sheds this persona with every further step she takes until she will be a Queen, but she won\u2019t have lost her kindness and other \u2018ladylike\u2019 characteristics.It is more of a transformation from Lady to Queen than a full-blown change.<br></p><p>From a doylist perspective Lady needs to die so that Sansa won\u2019t have a protector in King\u2019s Landing and her death is used by GRRM to drive a wedge between her and her sister and to alienate Sansa from her father. It is also a means to show us, how dangerous Cersei is. I think Lady\u2019s death is also a means to hide the fact that Sansa has some magic of her own. I\u2019m not sure I believe the theory that part of Lady lives on in her, but I am certain that Sansa has the magic of singing. This will be very important once she reunites with Jon in the books, as I have explained in my Beren and Luthien meta (here is the link to the <a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/171595236550/tolkien-and-grrm-the-tale-of-beren-and-luthien\">third part</a>) and my meta on \u201csingers singing songs\u201d (the part on Sansa is <a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/173800407095/singers-singing-songs-and-their-impact-on\">here</a>). <br></p><p>So, there are in-world and doylist reasons for Lady\u2019s death and none of them are connected to Sansa dying. People who predict Sansa\u2019s death are usually people who are still stuck in the opininon they shaped from Arya\u2019s first chapters in AGOT - chapters that strongly convey the \u2018Cinderella\u2019s awful step-sisters\u2019 vibes, and that are misleading the readers. This leads them to the opinion that Sansa somehow \u2018has to pay\u2019 and consequently sacrifice herself for Arya. You wouldn\u2019t believe some of the punishments Sansa haters manage to come up with! Sacrificing herself for Arya is one of the nicer ones\u2026. As if there weren\u2019t many, many much more nasty people in ASOIAF that GRRM would waste his time to punish one sister for the squabbles of children.<br></p><p>I don\u2019t believe that there is even the slightest chance that this will happen. Sansa is not the mean step-sister, but only readers who are ready to read her chapters carefully can disentangle themselves from the tropes GRRM cleverly put into place in AGOT.</p><p>No, Sansa and Arya will live:</p><blockquote><p>\nThe night the bird had come \nfrom Winterfell, Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle \ngodswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the \nriver.

Sansa drifted to sleep as \nthe moon rose, Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under \nNed\u2019s cloak. All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone. When dawn\n broke over the city, the dark red blooms of dragon\u2019s breath surrounded \nthe girls where they lay. \u201cI dreamed of Bran,\u201d Sansa had whispered to \nhim. \u201cI saw him smiling.\u201d\n \u00a0\u00a0 (AGOT, Eddard V).</p></blockquote><p>After the long Night, Sansa and Arya will be alive, Bran probably as well, even though maybe he\u2019ll be a tree ofr in some \u2018dream\u2019 situation, and maybe even Jon will live (dragon\u2019s breath). <br></p><p>I hope to have dispelled your doubts!<br></p><p>Thanks for the ask and thanks for the compliments!<br></p>",
                "content": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>I could give you a very long answer to this, but I just alert you to a series by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> (<a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173567788277/lady-and-the-ghost-part-1\">here, here </a>and <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173701172447/lady-and-the-ghost-part-3\">here). <br /></a></p><p>But to give you also a short answer: If Lady&rsquo;s death was a foreshadowing of Sansa&rsquo;s death you would have to ask, how she survived 7 seasons without Lady, when Robb and Grey Wind died almost simultaneously. <br /></p><p>The death of Lady has several reasons, some of them are Doylist reasons, some of them in-world. Lady is buried in Winterfell and this is an early hint that Sansa will return to Winterfell and that this is her home. Bran awakes after Lady is killed.
