Lord\u2019s liaison for the giants, you traveled a great deal between the Death Eater headquarters and the many colonies of giants. \u00a0It was your job to keep things smooth and pass along messages, since Voldemort preferred to visit the colony as little as possible due to his distaste for the beings.<br/></p><p>You had been away for a couple of days, engaging in some delicate discussions with a handful of leaders from different colonies. \u00a0The aurors were starting to take down too many of their brethren for comfort and they were beginning to grow cold feet as a consequence. \u00a0The Dark Lord would not be pleased with either their requests for him to show in person or their request of Death Eaters as back up for their raids on Muggle towns and cities.</p><p>You felt tired just thinking about it and slumped yourself in an overstuffed chair in the library\u2019s sitting area, not sure what to really do with yourself until the meeting in a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve returned.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Hearing the cold, but familiar drawl put a weak smile on your face and you turned your face to look at its source. \u00a0He was the reason you were here with a Dark Mark etched visibly into your left forearm, for better or worse.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Sev.\u201d \u00a0<br/></p><p>Seating himself in the chair across from you, Snape sat down a couple of leather bound books on the coffee table between you. \u00a0Both of them looked old and the gilded script on the first one\u2019s cover wasn\u2019t in English&hellip;or any other human script for that matter.</p><p>\u201cOoh, are these &hellip;?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Gobbledegook? \u00a0Indeed.\u201d \u00a0Pushing them toward you before leaning back in his seat, he was quick to avert his gaze out the nearby window and let his dark curtains of greasy hair obscure his face. \u00a0\u201cI thought they might be of interest to you &hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile at the gesture and were quick to pick up the top book and giving it a quick look over before turning your attention to the second. \u00a0\u201cThey absolutely are, thank you. \u00a0It looks like one\u2019s a compendium of famous goblin-made artifacts and the other is about goblin history with a focus on their rebellions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your visit with the giants? \u00a0You were gone longer than anticipated.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Terrible.</i>\u201d<i> \u00a0</i>That seemed to catch Severus\u2019 attention as he turned to look back at you. \u00a0\u201cThe aurors are getting more efficient at felling them and they\u2019re starting to reconsider the terms of their argument with the Dark Lord. \u00a0They\u2019re now requesting his presence at a summit in a couple weeks time for some potential renegotiations.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, I was afraid that would be the case. \u00a0The Dark Lord will not be pleased.\u201d \u00a0He turned his face away from you again, but you were able to catch the small frown and crease between his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m not looking forward to reporting about it in front of everyone, but it\u2019ll be okay. \u00a0It always is.\u201d \u00a0Truly, you dreaded what was to follow after when you had to go into more detail with him in private and receive your punishment for failing. \u00a0As unfair as it was, the Dark Lord would view this as a failure on your part.<br/></p><p>You saw Severus visibly tense at that, his fingers practically digging into the arms of the chair.\u00a0 Even if you couldn\u2019t see it, you got the impression that he was giving the gloomy courtyard outside one of his withering death stares.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeverus?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c&hellip; Pardon me?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u00a0It was quieter this time, softer as if there was some barely repressed emotion attempting to seep out.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut what&hellip;what are you sorry for? \u00a0This isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d \u00a0The softness was gone, a cold edge took its place, the abruptness of it was enough to make you flinch. \u00a0\u201cYet you joined because of me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cN-No, I\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Didn\u2019t </i>you?\u201d He didn\u2019t raise his voice, he didn\u2019t even have to. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t asking you, he was commanding you and it was clear that there wasn\u2019t any room for. \u00a0It was rare for him to direct that way of speaking to you, which made it all the more effective.<br/></p><p>Fidgeting with the book in your hands, you could only stare at it as if it was the most interesting thing you had ever seen. \u00a0\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable silence hung over the pair of you for a few moments, you felt tears beginning to well up and soon your vision was thoroughly blurred. \u00a0You didn\u2019t look up even when he stated your name, \u201cYou are a fool.\u201d</p><p>His tone wasn\u2019t as harsh, instead it was something softer, most likely pity.\u00a0 His expression of emotions was typically far subtler than other people, but you had put in a concerted effort into.\u00a0 Still, he wasn\u2019t wrong.\u00a0 You were a fool.\u00a0 Giving up so much just to follow the man you were <i>hopelessly</i> in love with?\u00a0 A terribly foolish thing, indeed.\u00a0 There was no debating that.</p><p>After a few moments passed and you didn\u2019t refute him or even say anything further, Severus stood up.\u00a0 In your peripheral vision, you could see the blur of his black robes and by some subconscious impulse, you ended up reaching out and gently grasping his wrist.\u00a0 Even though you knew you must have looked pathetic in that moment, you forced yourself to look up at him.</p><p>His expression was a blank mask as he looked down at you over his hooked nose, you managed to give him a weak smile before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re just as much of a fool as I am, Sev.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not your fault.\u00a0 None of this is\u201d\u2014you released his wrist\u2014\u201dsince I think we both know that this sort of thing can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>His mask had broken and even with your blurred vision you could practically see see a series of complex emotions pass over his face, as his eyebrows twitched and lips quivered.\u00a0 It took him a few moments to settle on pressing his lips together.</p><p>You were surprised when he exhaled heavily from his nose before reaching a hand down and gently wiped a tear away with the back of his curved index finger.\u00a0 You hadn\u2019t even been aware that your tears were beginning to overflow.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I detest crying.\u201d\u00a0 The wry delivery was enough to get a small chuckle out of you, which in turn put a small smile on his face. \u201cRegardless, I\u2019m afraid that my particular brand of foolishness is more&hellip;<i>complicated</i> than you know.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201c<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, well&hellip;\u00a0 What have we here?\u201d Malfoy sounded unmistakably pleased, you could imagine the smirk on his face from his place in the doorway behind you.\u00a0 Saying that you felt displeasure at his sudden appearance was a massive understatement.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Severus\u2019 expression almost instantaneously shifted back to something entirely neutral before he dropped his hand back to his side.\u00a0 \u201cIt is none of your concern, Lucius.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your companion took his leave from your side then, his bat-like robes billowing about him as he strode to meet your fellow Death Eater.\u00a0 You were quick to wipe the tears away from your face, doing what you could to make yourself look presentable.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it isn\u2019t, but can you blame me for my curiosity?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely: when it\u2019s not your business to be curious about.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat when you heard Severus\u2019s footsteps pause and you assumed that the two of them shared a look during it before the subject of your affections left the room.</p><p>Lucius called out your name and you craned your neck to look at him.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe Dark Lord requests your presence in his office most urgently.\u00a0 He does not wish to wait until the meeting to hear of what news you have.\u201d</p><p>It was most unwise to keep the Dark Lord waiting, especially when you didn\u2019t even have good news to report.\u00a0 Knowing such, you quickly stood up and began to gather up your new books with trembling hands, dread already building up in your stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u00a0 Thank you, Malfoy.\u201d</p><p>He gave you a curt nod before leaving you alone.\u00a0 With your books clutched to your chest, you did your best to steel your nerves before exiting the library with your head held high.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It would pass and now you at least had a conversation you looked forward to continue.\u00a0 Even with it all, you couldn\u2019t truly regret the path you had chosen.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Not yet.</p>",

out.<br></p><p>\u201cBut what\u2026what are you sorry for? \u00a0This isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d \u00a0The softness was gone, a cold edge took its place, the abruptness of it was enough to make you flinch. \u00a0\u201cYet you joined because of me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cN-No, I\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Didn\u2019t </i>you?\u201d He didn\u2019t raise his voice, he didn\u2019t even have to. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t asking you, he was commanding you and it was clear that there wasn\u2019t any room for. \u00a0It was rare for him to direct that way of speaking to you, which made it all the more effective.<br></p><p>Fidgeting with the book in your hands, you could only stare at it as if it was the most interesting thing you had ever seen. \u00a0\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable silence hung over the pair of you for a few moments, you felt tears beginning to well up and soon your vision was thoroughly blurred. \u00a0You didn\u2019t look up even when he stated your name, \u201cYou are a fool.\u201d</p><p>His tone wasn\u2019t as harsh, instead it was something softer, most likely pity.\u00a0 His expression of emotions was typically far subtler than other people, but you had put in a concerted effort into.\u00a0 Still, he wasn\u2019t wrong.\u00a0 You were a fool.\u00a0 Giving up so much just to follow the man you were <i>hopelessly</i> in love with?\u00a0 A terribly foolish thing, indeed.\u00a0 There was no debating that.</p><p>After a few moments passed and you didn\u2019t refute him or even say anything further, Severus stood up.\u00a0 In your peripheral vision, you could see the blur of his black robes and by some subconscious impulse, you ended up reaching out and gently grasping his wrist.\u00a0 Even though you knew you must have looked pathetic in that moment, you forced yourself to look up at him.</p><p>His expression was a blank mask as he looked down at you over his hooked nose, you managed to give him a weak smile before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re just as much of a fool as I am, Sev.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not your fault.\u00a0 None of this is\u201d\u2014you released his wrist\u2014\u201dsince I think we both know that this sort of thing can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>His mask had broken and even with your blurred vision you could practically see see a series of complex emotions pass over his face, as his eyebrows twitched and lips quivered.\u00a0 It took him a few moments to settle on pressing his lips together.</p><p>You were surprised when he exhaled heavily from his nose before reaching a hand down and gently wiped a tear away with the back of his curved index finger.\u00a0 You hadn\u2019t even been aware that your tears were beginning to overflow.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I detest crying.\u201d\u00a0 The wry delivery was enough to get a small chuckle out of you, which in turn put a small smile on his face. \u201cRegardless, I\u2019m afraid that my particular brand of foolishness is more\u2026<i>complicated</i> than you know.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201c<br></p><p>\u201cWell, well\u2026\u00a0 What have we here?\u201d Malfoy sounded unmistakably pleased, you could imagine the smirk on his face from his place in the doorway behind you.\u00a0 Saying that you felt displeasure at his sudden appearance was a massive understatement.\u00a0<br></p><p>Severus\u2019 expression almost instantaneously shifted back to something entirely neutral before he dropped his hand back to his side.\u00a0 \u201cIt is none of your concern, Lucius.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your companion took his leave from your side then, his bat-like robes billowing about him as he strode to meet your fellow Death Eater.\u00a0 You were quick to wipe the tears away from your face, doing what you could to make yourself look presentable.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it isn\u2019t, but can you blame me for my curiosity?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely: when it\u2019s not your business to be curious about.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat when you heard Severus\u2019s footsteps pause and you assumed that the two of them shared a look during it before the subject of your affections left the room.</p><p>Lucius called out your name and you craned your neck to look at him.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe Dark Lord requests your presence in his office most urgently.\u00a0 He does not wish to wait until the meeting to hear of what news you have.\u201d</p><p>It was most unwise to keep the Dark Lord waiting, especially when you didn\u2019t even have good news to report.\u00a0 Knowing such, you quickly stood up and began to gather up your new books with trembling hands, dread already building up in your stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u00a0 Thank you, Malfoy.\u201d</p><p>He gave you a curt nod before leaving you alone.\u00a0 With your books clutched to your chest, you did your best to steel your nerves before exiting the library with your head held high.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It would pass and now you at least had a conversation you looked forward to continue.\u00a0 Even with it all, you couldn\u2019t truly regret the path you had chosen.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Not yet.</p>",

Lord\u2019s liaison for the giants, you traveled a great deal between the Death Eater headquarters and the many colonies of giants. \u00a0It was your job to keep things smooth and pass along messages, since Voldemort preferred to visit the colony as little as possible due to his distaste for the beings.<br></p><p>You had been away for a couple of days, engaging in some delicate discussions with a handful of leaders from different colonies. \u00a0The aurors were starting to take down too many of their brethren for comfort and they were beginning to grow cold feet as a consequence. \u00a0The Dark Lord would not be pleased with either their requests for him to show in person or their request of Death Eaters as back up for their raids on Muggle towns and cities.</p><p>You felt tired just thinking about it and slumped yourself in an overstuffed chair in the library\u2019s sitting area, not sure what to really do with yourself until the meeting in a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve returned.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Hearing the cold, but familiar drawl put a weak smile on your face and you turned your face to look at its source. \u00a0He was the reason you were here with a Dark Mark etched visibly into your left forearm, for better or worse.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Sev.\u201d \u00a0<br></p><p>Seating himself in the chair across from you, Snape sat down a couple of leather bound books on the coffee table between you. \u00a0Both of them looked old and the gilded script on the first one\u2019s cover wasn\u2019t in English\u2026or any other human script for that matter.</p><p>\u201cOoh, are these \u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Gobbledegook? \u00a0Indeed.\u201d \u00a0Pushing them toward you before leaning back in his seat, he was quick to avert his gaze out the nearby window and let his dark curtains of greasy hair obscure his face. \u00a0\u201cI thought they might be of interest to you \u2026\u201d<br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but smile at the gesture and were quick to pick up the top book and giving it a quick look over before turning your attention to the second. \u00a0\u201cThey absolutely are, thank you. \u00a0It looks like one\u2019s a compendium of famous goblin-made artifacts and the other is about goblin history with a focus on their rebellions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your visit with the giants? \u00a0You were gone longer than anticipated.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Terrible.</i>\u201d<i> \u00a0</i>That seemed to catch Severus\u2019 attention as he turned to look back at you. \u00a0\u201cThe aurors are getting more efficient at felling them and they\u2019re starting to reconsider the terms of their argument with the Dark Lord. \u00a0They\u2019re now requesting his presence at a summit in a couple weeks time for some potential renegotiations.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes, I was afraid that would be the case. \u00a0The Dark Lord will not be pleased.\u201d \u00a0He turned his face away from you again, but you were able to catch the small frown and crease between his eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m not looking forward to reporting about it in front of everyone, but it\u2019ll be okay. \u00a0It always is.\u201d \u00a0Truly, you dreaded what was to follow after when you had to go into more detail with him in private and receive your punishment for failing. \u00a0As unfair as it was, the Dark Lord would view this as a failure on your part.<br></p><p>You saw Severus visibly tense at that, his fingers practically digging into the arms of the chair.\u00a0 Even if you couldn\u2019t

Pardon me?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; &nbsp;It was quieter this time, softer as if there was some barely repressed emotion attempting to seep out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But what&hellip;what are you sorry for? &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t belong here.&rdquo; &nbsp;The softness was gone, a cold edge took its place, the abruptness of it was enough to make you flinch. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yet you joined because of me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;N-No, I&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Didn&rsquo;t </i>you?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t raise his voice, he didn&rsquo;t even have to. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t asking you, he was commanding you and it was clear that there wasn&rsquo;t any room for. &nbsp;It was rare for him to direct that way of speaking to you, which made it all the more effective.<br /></p><p>Fidgeting with the book in your hands, you could only stare at it as if it was the most interesting thing you had ever seen. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p><p>An uncomfortable silence hung over the pair of you for a few moments, you felt tears beginning to well up and soon your vision was thoroughly blurred. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t look up even when he stated your name, &ldquo;You are a fool.&rdquo;</p><p>His tone wasn&rsquo;t as harsh, instead it was something softer, most likely pity.&nbsp; His expression of emotions was typically far subtler than other people, but you had put in a concerted effort into.&nbsp; Still, he wasn&rsquo;t wrong.&nbsp; You were a fool.&nbsp; Giving up so much just to follow the man you were <i>hopelessly</i> in love with?&nbsp; A terribly foolish thing, indeed.&nbsp; There was no debating that.</p><p>After a few moments passed and you didn&rsquo;t refute him or even say anything further, Severus stood up.&nbsp; In your peripheral vision, you could see the blur of his black robes and by some subconscious impulse, you ended up reaching out and gently grasping his wrist.&nbsp; Even though you knew you must have looked pathetic in that moment, you forced yourself to look up at him.</p><p>His expression was a blank mask as he looked down at you over his hooked nose, you managed to give him a weak smile before saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as much of a fool as I am, Sev.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not your fault.&nbsp; None of this is&rdquo;&mdash;you released his wrist&mdash;&rdquo;since I think we both know that this sort of thing can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p><p>His mask had broken and even with your blurred vision you could practically see see a series of complex emotions pass over his face, as his eyebrows twitched and lips quivered.&nbsp; It took him a few moments to settle on pressing his lips together.</p><p>You were surprised when he exhaled heavily from his nose before reaching a hand down and gently wiped a tear away with the back of his curved index finger.&nbsp; You hadn&rsquo;t even been aware that your tears were beginning to overflow.</p><p>&ldquo;You know how I detest crying.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wry delivery was enough to get a small chuckle out of you, which in turn put a small smile on his face. &ldquo;Regardless, I&rsquo;m afraid that my particular brand of foolishness is more&hellip;<i>complicated</i> than you know.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you&mdash;&ldquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, well&hellip;&nbsp; What have we here?&rdquo; Malfoy sounded unmistakably pleased, you could imagine the smirk on his face from his place in the doorway behind you.&nbsp; Saying that you felt displeasure at his sudden appearance was a massive understatement.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Severus&rsquo; expression almost instantaneously shifted back to something entirely neutral before he dropped his hand back to his side.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is none of your concern, Lucius.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Your companion took his leave from your side then, his bat-like robes billowing about him as he strode to meet your fellow Death Eater.&nbsp; You were quick to wipe the tears away from your face, doing what you could to make yourself look presentable.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose it isn&rsquo;t, but can you blame me for my curiosity?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely: when it&rsquo;s not your business to be curious about.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a beat when you heard Severus&rsquo;s footsteps pause and you assumed that the two of them shared a look during it before the subject of your affections left the room.</p><p>Lucius called out your name and you craned your neck to look at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The Dark Lord requests your presence in his office most urgently.&nbsp; He does not wish to wait until the meeting to hear of what news you have.&rdquo;</p><p>It was most unwise to keep the Dark Lord waiting, especially when you didn&rsquo;t even have good news to report.&nbsp; Knowing such, you quickly stood up and began to gather up your new books with trembling hands, dread already building up in your stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right there.&nbsp; Thank you, Malfoy.&rdquo;</p><p>He gave you a curt nod before leaving you alone.&nbsp; With your books clutched to your chest, you did your best to steel your nerves before exiting the library with your head held high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It would pass and now you at least had a conversation you looked forward to continue.&nbsp; Even with it all, you couldn&rsquo;t truly regret the path you had chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Not yet.</p>",

        "body": "<h1>Coffee</h1><p>Draco wanted to cry. He really did. Only his energy was limited, and he&rsquo;d already spent it all on curling up in a ball on the break room couch. Which meant that now he could only stare at the tiny kitchen, eyes glassy and heart filled with betreyal. </p><p>Empty.</p><p>It was empty. </p><p>He could already feel his migrane set in. </p><p>&ldquo;Draco? Are you alright? What are you doing here? Didn&rsquo;t night shift end like two hours ago?&rdquo; </p><p>Draco would be pissed if he had the energy for it. Fucking Potter stood in the door opening, with his stupid hair and his stupid skinny jeans and his stupid muscled arms which he had no right to have! Potter had quit the aurors and now worked at a small coffeeshop as barista. </p><p>Which reminded Draco of his own terrible fate. </p><p>&ldquo;Coffee&rsquo;s gone. I had overtime and now it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; Tears actually fell from his eyes now. &ldquo;Stupid morning shift drank it all.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh honey.&rdquo; Potter was at his side in an instant, pulling him in a bone crushing hug. &ldquo;You really hate your job, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No. I just want coffee.&rdquo; Draco hated how small his voice was. &ldquo;I can manage with coffee.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you coffee, don&rsquo;t you worry love.&rdquo; Potter kissed the side of his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll apparate us to my work and make my first cup just for you, how does that sound?&rdquo; </p><p>Draco didn&rsquo;t respond.
