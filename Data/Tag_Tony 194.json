No further information was forthcoming.</p><p>&ldquo;A transfor - sorry, Jarvis, you&rsquo;re going to have to give me a hand here.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He appears, to all intents and purposes, to be a seven-year-old boy.&rdquo; Steve braced his hands against the kitchen counter, and sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony &hellip; OK, very funny, but also, <i>very </i>early in the morning. If you could hold off until -&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you, Captain, this is no joke,&rdquo; Jarvis interjected, sounding slightly stressed. &ldquo;It is against my programming to lie.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Steve snorted, gingerly picking up the cup, now full of hot coffee. &ldquo;If this is a ploy to get coffee delivered, I&rsquo;m surprised he doesn&rsquo;t have a machine in his room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Captain Rogers, I assure you -&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, Tony, I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Steve grumbled, heading toward the elevator to the personal levels. &ldquo;Honestly, your dependence on this stuff, anyway &hellip;&ldquo;</p><p>He faltered a little in his stride when the elevator doors opened to reveal Natasha, her brow furrowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Nat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did Jarvis call you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes - well, I sort of assumed it was Tony -&ldquo; Nat shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d mess with me. He values his limbs too much.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;I was mid work-out, though, so if this does turn out to be a ruse, I&rsquo;m all warmed up and ready to push him through something glass and replaceable.&rdquo; Steve stepped in alongside her.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t seriously be suggesting that he&rsquo;s a child?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Figuratively? Absolutely. Literally? Well &hellip; those were <i>actual</i> Nazi dinosaurs we fought last week.&rdquo; The elevator doors opened on Tony&rsquo;s floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s everyone else?&rdquo; Steve directed to the ceiling, beginning to accept that this was how his morning was starting. They headed for Tony&rsquo;s bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;You are the two on site I thought proper to inform,&rdquo; Jarvis said. &ldquo;Mr. Barton is perhaps not best suited to the sensitivity of this situation, and I deemed it unwise to put undue, unexpected pressure on Dr. Banner.&rdquo; Steve raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, now I&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also the best looking,&rdquo; Natasha said, smirking at Steve. &ldquo;Maybe this is his way of propositioning us for a threesome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you -&ldquo; Steve stammered, heat flooding his face, &ldquo;Do people really -&ldquo; Nat laughed and slapped him on the back, which he didn&rsquo;t find reassuring at all. She reached for the door.</p><p>&ldquo;If I may,&rdquo; Jarvis said. &ldquo;Captain, I thought you should be informed, but I believe it would be wiser for you to initially remain outside. Ms. Romanov will be better received.&rdquo; Steve frowned, and took a step back. He felt adrenaline begin to prickle his skin. That did sound more like Jarvis than Tony. Nat&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</p><p>&ldquo;If there actually is a child in here, Jarvis, I hope you&rsquo;re not suggesting it needs &lsquo;a woman&rsquo;s touch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can assure you, Ms. Romanov, the situation is rather more complicated than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it always,&rdquo; Nat muttered, pushing open the door.</p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F16441238%2Fchapters%2F38498054&amp;t=ZGEyNTNhNTdhNjExNGNmNjkyMGMwOWM2MWQ1ZTBkMmI2NzFhZGJhMSwxTU52OGZFTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ACVJ_gqDAui2dfhOb7zfXNw&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fcoveredsnow.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F180996837956%2Fchapter-7-of-provide-me-is-up&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a></p>",
