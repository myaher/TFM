Plus, lots of some good feminism and literature.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&bull; Last thing I googled: </b>How to write&nbsp;&lsquo;asshole&rsquo; in high valyrian. Couldn&rsquo;t find. Anyone?</p><p><b>&bull; Do I have any other blogs:</b>&nbsp;Yes, my main one and an actual fashion blog. :D</p><p><b>&bull; Do I get asks:</b>&nbsp;Unfortunally a bunch of negative ones lately so I do appreciate any nice ones. I do love getting asks, but I&rsquo;d prefer some positive ones. I did get a nice one earlier today, thanks for that one, anon. You guys can always ask me stuff, when I&rsquo;m around I love to answer it.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&bull; Why did I choose my URL:</b>&nbsp;toaquiprashippar means&nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m here to ship it&rsquo;, this is my safe space to ship all my ships and let the obsession run free. What a bless.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&bull; Following:</b>&nbsp;Some great people.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&bull; Followed by:</b>&nbsp;Some awesome people.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&bull; Average hours of sleep:</b> Honestly? Around 5 or 6 when I&rsquo;m working or mom wakes me up early (considering I usually sleep very late, I&rsquo;m a night owl!) and next to 7/8 whenever I can.</p><p><b>&bull; Lucky number: </b>13 and 2. Dunno, don&rsquo;t ask. They just seem to bring me luck.</p><p><b>&bull; Instruments: </b>Not one, I tried guittar, but apparently I suck on it. But I can sing, does that count for anything?&nbsp;<b></b></p><p><b>&bull; What I am wearing:</b>&nbsp;Denim shorts and a blue gym top. It&rsquo;s really hot here right now.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&bull; Dream trip:</b> Wherever I can see the Northern Lights, but even though you can&rsquo;t see it there, I can say any trip to London is a dreamy one, I love that place.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&bull; Fav food: </b>Italian and Japonese. Either one, I&rsquo;m in. Also, brazilian food damn a good feijoada, am I right?</p><p><b>&bull; Nationality: Brazilian :D</b></p><p><b>&bull; Fav song</b>: One does not have a favorite song, come on. But right now?&nbsp;&lsquo;Girls Like You&rsquo; by Maroon 5 and&nbsp;&lsquo;Sons and Daughters&rsquo; by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eru8DlHoOFM\" target=\"_blank\">Allman Brown &amp; Liz Lawrence</a>\n\n</p><p><b>&bull; Last book I read: </b>A Game Of Thrones, currently reading A Clash Of Kings.

A Clash Of Kings by George RR Martin.</p><p><b>&bull; Top 3 universes I wanna join:</b>&nbsp;Not sure if it&rsquo;s actually healthy to join Westeros but damn I would love to be a dragonrider Targaryen, or a Stark warg. LOL&nbsp;<br />Marvel, can I be an mutant Avenger, please? I just want to be buddies with Tony Stark and have powers to save the world.&nbsp;<br />Also, Harry Potter.

You think you stood there for a solid ten minutes before FRIDAY interrupted the comfortable silence, saying that Tony is needed downstairs in the conference room.

Feedback is much appreciated and my ask box is open for requests (mainly Tony and Bucky, but you can send in other Marvel characters and I will see what I can do!) Thanks for reading :)</p><p>You wake up to the soft rays of sunlight streaming in through the translucent curtain and the weight of an arm over your waist. Gently turning around as to not wake Tony up, you lightly snake your arms around his neck and bury your face in the crook of his neck. A faint scent of whiskey and sandalwood surrounded you, no doubt thanks to the glass of whiskey he had nursed last night. </p><p>Home. Right here in Tony\u2019s arms, you are home.</p><p>You grew up with a strict and stoic father figure and a relaxed yet fussy mother. Like Tony, you entered your teenage years, looking to your father for anything, a word of praise or encouragement for your achievements, only to be met with more comments and comparisons to others. Although, that was the least of your problems, considering the fact that he had cheated on your mother on multiple occasions and she still stayed for you and your brother, resulting in an easily irritable family and arguments being a common household activity. For the last few years of staying with your parents, you constantly had to pull on a mask and tip toe around them when speaking because a mistake will send your parents into argument hour. You hated it. Hated the insincerity of the place and its people.</p><p>Your childhood left you wanting to be better for your children. And now, you are going to have one of your own with the love of your life.</p><p>You wish you could go back and tell your younger self of the man who loves you with every fibre of his being, and tell her to stop chasing after the boys who didn\u2019t matter. So that her heart wasn\u2019t broken over and over again by boys who did not recognise her value or appreciate the enormity of her love. If only she could have saved all her love for this man sleeping beside her peacefully, his heartbeat a steady rhythm against your ribcage.</p><p>Like every morning, Tony greets you with a kiss on your forehead and tugging you even closer to him. You smile against his skin, fingers moving north to brush through his dark hair. His fingers slip under his shirt that you had on, drawing soothing circles on your back. Both of you equally love the few minutes between sleep and getting up for the day, which were filled with these silent moments of touch and affection, and more often than not, you both just laze around in bed for at least half an hour.</p><p>Tony had admitted to you that he is touch starved after several months of dating and you\u2019d be lying if you said you weren\u2019t. Instead, you just pulled him in for a long tight hug, one arm around his back and fingers tangled in his hair, and he was holding onto you just as tight. You think you stood there for a solid ten minutes before FRIDAY interrupted the comfortable silence, saying that Tony is needed downstairs in the conference room. You made it a point to grab on to his hand and tell him that you were just as touch starved as he was, if not more, before he left.</p><p>Finally satisfied by his scent, you lift your head to plant a soft sleepy kiss on his lips. Once, twice, thrice. Morning kisses aren\u2019t lust-filled most of the time. There was no rush, no need or chase for a release. Just innocence and love, free of your duties and worries. Mornings in bed, you are just (Y/N) and Tony, nothing more than two people being madly in love.</p><p>\u201cMorning, love.\u201d Tony smiles at you with a sparkle in his chocolate eyes. Your heart soars, just like it does every time he calls you love. And just like it did when he went down on one knee and ended his speech by calling you his love. And in that moment, you just\u00a0<i>knew\u00a0</i>you are going to spend the rest of your life with this man.\u00a0<i>Your love.</i></p><hr><p>tag(s): <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAiBMMVNpb0axjbR4ech-jw\">@lilyrosebae</a></p>",
