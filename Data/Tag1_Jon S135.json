R. Martin</a><br /><b>Rating</b>: Mature<br /><b>Relationships</b>: Jon Snow/Daenerys Targaryen<br /><b>Summary</b>:(I posted this back in September but just decided to continue on with it!) Jon and Daenerys have been estranged since the truth about his parentage was revealed. Unwilling to rule without her and filled with uncertainty, Jon knocks on Dany&rsquo;s door late at night for the second time. A one shot set shortly after the beginning of season 8.</p></blockquote><p><b>Excerpt: <br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;Will there be anything else, Your Grace?&rdquo; Lord Glover asked, making a point to emphasize Jon&rsquo;s title. His tone was not lost on Daenerys. </p><p>A small council was gathered in the Great Hall, not the usually large number of Northern lords and members of Dany&rsquo;s retinue. Robett Glover, Lyanna Mormont, and Yohn Royce represented the Northmen and the Vale. Davos, Gendry, and Tyrion were seated together as well as Missandei, Theon, Arya, Bran and Sansa. Jorah Mormont and Grey Worm stood faithfully behind Daenerys. The council had been discussing the best way to fortify Winterfell against a potential attack from the White Walkers and what to do with Jaime Lannister who had recently arrived from King&rsquo;s Landing with the ominous news that Cersei Lannister had no intention of holding up her side of the peace treaty and that Euron Greyjoy had not turned tail for the Iron Islands but was sailing to lead the Golden Company. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jon replied. &ldquo;There is something else.&rdquo; </p><p>Whatever he was about to say, he had made no mention of it to Dany before he left her chambers that morning. They had slept late and she was truly surprised to find him still in her bed when she awoke with the familiar nausea that had plagued her of late. She thought he must have needed a good night&rsquo;s rest to still be asleep even when Missandei entered her rooms to help her dress for the day. Her friend had regarded his sleeping form with wide eyes, but Dany merely shrugged. There was time enough for her to explain what had transpired the previous night after Jon was awake. She waited until after she was dressed and her Missandei had gone before she gently woke him and they parted ways for most of the day. </p><p>&ldquo;I know many of you have been anxious for me to make a decision regarding the Iron Throne. I&rsquo;ve listened to all of your counsel and advice and last night I came to my conclusion.&rdquo; </p><p>He paused and looked directly at Daenerys before speaking again. For a brief moment she feared that he had reconsidered his proposal. Dread sat like a weight in the pit of her stomach as she clasped her hands together in her lap. She knew she was being foolish. Jon Snow was many &nbsp;things, but two-faced and deceitful were not among his attributes. </p><p>&ldquo;I have decided to rule,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Together <i>with </i>Daenerys. As equals.&rdquo; </p><p>A murmur echoed through the Great Hall and Dany felt the color begin to rise in her cheeks. She knew the notion of a joint rule seemed unusual. Even Jaehaerys and Alysanne did not rule as equals, despite the esteem he held for her. Westeros had never been ruled by joint rulers. She did not want to look away from him, did not dare to find approval or disapproval among her friends and foes. </p><p><i>Together</i>, he had said. He was fond of that word, she noted. He had used it before they departed Dragonstone for White Harbor and ever since then he spoke of what they would accomplish together whether it was in the North against the Night King or in the South against Cersei. He had promised her before they reached Winterfell that they would face everything <i>together</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; Lord Glover sputtered. &ldquo;Surely I must ask you to reconsider this matter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; Jon replied firmly and Dany was not sure if his answer was for Glover&rsquo;s benefit or her own. </p><p>&ldquo;Surely there is a more <i>suitable </i>match&hellip;one that would unite the <i>North </i>with the Iron Throne. The Karstark girl, or&hellip;or even Lady Stark. She is, afterall, merely your cousin.&rdquo; <br /></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16071494/chapters/41924237#workskin\"><b>Read the rest of Chapter 2 on AO3!</b></a><br /></p></p>",

        "answer": "<p>Hi Char!</p><p>I\u2019ll keep it to three&hellip;.. Three examples that show, that Jon cares for people and that he is smart and sometimes devious.<br/></p><p>Jon cares for all his siblings/cousins, when he persuades Ned not to kill the direwolf pups. Jon was introduced here, and it really helped me like him. <br/></p><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;Lord Stark,&rdquo; Jon said. It \nwas strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him \nwith desperate hope. &ldquo;There are five pups,&rdquo; he told Father. &ldquo;Three male,\n two female.&rdquo;\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What of it, Jon?&ldquo;\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You have five trueborn children,&rdquo; Jon said.\n &ldquo;Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. \nYour children were meant to have these pups, my lord.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>\nBran saw his father&rsquo;s face \nchange, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his \nheart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother \nhad done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself.\n He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the \nbastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given\n to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of \ntheir own.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Their father understood as well. &ldquo;You want no pup for yourself, Jon?&rdquo; he asked softly.\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,&ldquo; Jon pointed out. &quot;I am no Stark, Father.&rdquo;\n\n(AGOT, Bran I)<br/></p></blockquote><p>When he looks out for Sam and serves the Night\u2019s Watch when he persuades Maester Aemon to take Sam as steward. It shows that he cares for his friend Sam, another one of my favourites (I love their friendship). It shows again how he can negotiate, but also that he is ruthless when it comes to the wellfare of his friend Sam over the unsympathetic Chett.<br/></p><blockquote><p>\nMaester Aemon smiled. &ldquo;And so?&rdquo;\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;The Night&rsquo;s Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn&rsquo;t make Sam\n a warrior, and Ser Alliser won&rsquo;t either. You can&rsquo;t hammer tin into \niron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean tin is \nuseless.

Finally he said, \n&ldquo;Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft as your \nblade, it would seem.&rdquo; (AGOT, Jon V)<br /></p></blockquote><p>And as a last example, Jon not watching out for a friend, but for a woman he only knows superficially, just because she is in need of help, and again he is acting smart! He watches out for Alys Karstark in ADWD, not only marries her to Sigorn but also makes sure, that her bad uncle won&rsquo;t pester her or abduct her:</p><blockquote><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cregan Karstark had turned up a day behind his niece. With him \ncame four mounted men-at-arms, a huntsman, and a pack of dogs, sniffing \nafter Lady Alys as if she were a deer. Jon Snow met them on the \nkingsroad half a league south of Mole&rsquo;s Town, before they could turn up \nat Castle Black, claim guest right, or call for parley. One of \nKarstark&rsquo;s men had loosed a crossbow quarrel at Ty and died for it. That\n left four, and Cregan himself.\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately they had a dozen ice cells. Room for all.\n\n(ADWD, Jon X)<br /></p></blockquote><p>I also like this because it may foreshadow Sansa arriving at Castle Black as the Girl in Grey, but Jon takes care that Cregan can&rsquo;t wriggle through the holes the usual laws of Westeros would normally leave him.</p><p>Thanks for the ask! Lovely idea!<br /></p>",
