McGonagall is the only one who seems to have a grasp of balance when disciplining the children at school. Snape is extremely harsh, Lupin is shown as favoring Harry, as is Lockhart, Crouch tries to kill him, but is, honestly the next closest to being fair with him and of course Umbridge is a fucking worm. Dumbledore, however, is the biggest issue. He lets Harry get away with so much when it comes to rewarding him for being a rule breaker. There was no need for Harry to go to the 3rd floor. Quirrel couldn&rsquo;t get past the Mirror of Erised. He was extremely arrogant to think this way, but in the end, rather than being punished for endangering themselves and other students, the trio is rewarded.
