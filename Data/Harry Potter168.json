They\u2019re not a problem. They have\nabsolutely no idea. I\u2019m still clean.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a\nshaky breath, then a hysterical laugh. \u201cYou think it\u2019s <i>Vongola</i> that\nfound out? No. It\u2019s worse than that. I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>What was\nworse than the Vongola?</p><p>He doesn\u2019t\nhave time to think of the answer\u00a0because it\u2019s about that time that the\ndoor to the bar opens and four people walk in.</p><p>He wants to\nrun but his knees go weak and he muffles a whimper.</p><p>Yes, <i>they</i>\nare worse than the Vongola.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to kill you\ntoo fast,\u201d Reborn informs the vermin hanging by his wrists from the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d de Luca sobs\nunashamedly the moment he\u2019d recovered from what Viper did to make him sleep.\n\u201cWhat did I do? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Reborn goes still, then he yanks him\nforward, not minding his strength in the least. \u201cDo you mean to say you sold\nout news of a pregnant Sky on accident? Hmm? Did you? de Luca, I have no idea\nif you\u2019re extremely\u00a0lucky or extremely\u00a0unlucky. Probably a\ncombination of both.\u201d</p><p>de Luca cries\u00a0silently, finally\nunderstanding he\u2019d crossed the line that all mafiosos never cross.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start with his back, Reborn can\nhave the rest of him.\u201d Fon says calmly, that unnerving smile still there.\n\u201cViper, do you have a knife?\u201d</p><p>Reborn wants to pout, but the sight\nof the snivelling man has already soothed the savage anger in him.</p><p>\u201cOf course, \u201d Viper nods, tossing\nover a small but wickedly sharp stiletto knife. \u201cDon\u2019t get blood on the\nhandle.\u201d</p><p>Fon, being a professional and having\nworked with the Triads for years, does it cleanly and quickly. The blood\nsplatter is cleverly disguised by the red silk he\u2019s wearing.</p><p>Really, if Reborn didn\u2019t like Fon so\nmuch, he would absolutely not trust the man to watch his back. Men who smiled\nwhile carving a picture on someone\u2019s back are on another level.</p><p>Skull, who had been pretty\u00a0quiet\nso far, huffs and lets out a wisp of Cloud Flames, connecting it to the ring\nhe\u2019d slipped on the vermin earlier.</p><p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d Skull mutters. \u201cJust\nbecause I said I\u2019d keep an eye on the blood levels doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t\navoid the major arteries.\u201d</p><p>Fon\nlaughs, which. Hmm. What\u00a0<i>does</i>\u00a0Fon do for\nthe Triads?</p><p>\u201cReborn, he fainted,\u201d Viper says\nirritably.</p><p>Reborn directs a jolt of Sun Flames,\nenough for an adrenaline rush but not enough to heal him. The man wakes up and\ncries\u00a0again, weak little whimpers that cooled the anger in him. The memory\nof Hyacinth\u2019s trembling fingers fans it back to a roaring flame though. He will\nnever forgive this man.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he sobs.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Reborn tilts his head to the side.\n\u201cAny of you know how to make him stop talking? He can still scream if we do\nthat, right?\u201d</p><p>Fon laughs again, moving to stand\nbeside Reborn. \u201cPut your Flames on his throat, I\u2019ll take care of his tongue.\u201d</p><p>The Storm Flames coating his fingers\ntell Reborn how he\u2019s going to remove it. He has no qualms on how painful it\nwould be. Burning tongues away is a novel way to do it though. He takes note of\nit. </p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>The video\nrockets its way to infamy. </p><p>Frederico de\nLuca\u2019s body is found in a bathtub, chains weighing him down, covered in honey\nand surrounded by flies that slowly eat him as he rots alive. Not that he has\nlong when they find him. His lungs punctured by micro-thin needles ensure that\nhe\u2019s slowly drowning in his own blood.</p><p>It\u2019s a slow\nand painful death.</p><p>Everyone\nknows who killed him, even without the video. </p><p>There\u2019s a\nchameleon with a pacifier around its neck carved on the man\u2019s back in exquisite\ndetail.</p><p>.</p><hr><p>.</p><p>\u201cLove,\neverything alright?\u201d Hyacinth asks, harvesting sunflower seeds carefully.</p><p>The four\nArcobaleno lounge about. Viper is making notes, Fon is sleeping, Skull is\neating his body weight in homemade pizza and Reborn is cuddling Teddy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nperfect,\u201d he smiles at her. \u201cThat leak you found earlier is fixed. We spent all\nday plugging it.\u201d</p><p>Hyacinth\nblinks, before finding herself caught up in a hug.</p><p>\u201cReborn,\u201d\nTeddy says. \u201cHaya pruned the fruit trees the normal way.\u201d</p><p>Reborn ran a\nglowing yellow hand over her body in response. \u201cThe normal way being no magic,\nam I right?\u201d</p><p>Hyacinth\nnods. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a surplus of fruits now. Do you want it turned into wine or\njam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not\nboth?\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you knew how to make wine.\u201d</p><p>She gives\nhim a look. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry you. I mean, we\u2019re magically married. How can I\n<i>not</i> know how to make wine when you buy <i>three bottles</i> every\nmonth?\u201d</p><p>His heart\nswells. He loves this woman so much.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\ndeserve you,\u201d he whispers, sadly.</p><p>Teddy, still\non his shoulders, kisses his head in comfort.</p><p>\u201cStop that\nnon-sense, you\u2019re perfect for me,\u201d she corrects him. \u201cSo. Strawberry Jam and\nOrange Wine?\u201d</p><p>Reborn\nlaughs.</p>",

Men who smiled\nwhile carving a picture on someone&rsquo;s back are on another level.</p><p>Skull, who had been pretty&nbsp;quiet\nso far, huffs and lets out a wisp of Cloud Flames, connecting it to the ring\nhe&rsquo;d slipped on the vermin earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly,&rdquo; Skull mutters. &ldquo;Just\nbecause I said I&rsquo;d keep an eye on the blood levels doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t\navoid the major arteries.&rdquo;</p><p>Fon\nlaughs, which. Hmm. What&nbsp;<i>does</i>&nbsp;Fon do for\nthe Triads?</p><p>&ldquo;Reborn, he fainted,&rdquo; Viper says\nirritably.</p><p>Reborn directs a jolt of Sun Flames,\nenough for an adrenaline rush but not enough to heal him. The man wakes up and\ncries&nbsp;again, weak little whimpers that cooled the anger in him. The memory\nof Hyacinth&rsquo;s trembling fingers fans it back to a roaring flame though. He will\nnever forgive this man.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he sobs.\n&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>Reborn tilts his head to the side.\n&ldquo;Any of you know how to make him stop talking? He can still scream if we do\nthat, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Fon laughs again, moving to stand\nbeside Reborn. &ldquo;Put your Flames on his throat, I&rsquo;ll take care of his tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>The Storm Flames coating his fingers\ntell Reborn how he&rsquo;s going to remove it. He has no qualms on how painful it\nwould be. Burning tongues away is a novel way to do it though. He takes note of\nit. </p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>The video\nrockets its way to infamy. </p><p>Frederico de\nLuca&rsquo;s body is found in a bathtub, chains weighing him down, covered in honey\nand surrounded by flies that slowly eat him as he rots alive. Not that he has\nlong when they find him. His lungs punctured by micro-thin needles ensure that\nhe&rsquo;s slowly drowning in his own blood.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a slow\nand painful death.</p><p>Everyone\nknows who killed him, even without the video. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a\nchameleon with a pacifier around its neck carved on the man&rsquo;s back in exquisite\ndetail.</p><p>.</p><hr /><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Love,\neverything alright?&rdquo; Hyacinth asks, harvesting sunflower seeds carefully.</p><p>The four\nArcobaleno lounge about. Viper is making notes, Fon is sleeping, Skull is\neating his body weight in homemade pizza and Reborn is cuddling Teddy.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nperfect,&rdquo; he smiles at her. &ldquo;That leak you found earlier is fixed. We spent all\nday plugging it.&rdquo;</p><p>Hyacinth\nblinks, before finding herself caught up in a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Reborn,&rdquo;\nTeddy says. &ldquo;Haya pruned the fruit trees the normal way.&rdquo;</p><p>Reborn ran a\nglowing yellow hand over her body in response. &ldquo;The normal way being no magic,\nam I right?&rdquo;</p><p>Hyacinth\nnods. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a surplus of fruits now. Do you want it turned into wine or\njam?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not\nboth?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you knew how to make wine.&rdquo;</p><p>She gives\nhim a look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry you. I mean, we&rsquo;re magically married. How can I\n<i>not</i> know how to make wine when you buy <i>three bottles</i> every\nmonth?&rdquo;</p><p>His heart\nswells. He loves this woman so much.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\ndeserve you,&rdquo; he whispers, sadly.</p><p>Teddy, still\non his shoulders, kisses his head in comfort.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop that\nnon-sense, you&rsquo;re perfect for me,&rdquo; she corrects him. &ldquo;So. Strawberry Jam and\nOrange Wine?&rdquo;</p><p>Reborn\nlaughs.</p>",

He&rsquo;s not calmer, oh no. The red-hot\nrage is simmering, and now it&rsquo;s almost like all of him is seething.</p>\n<p>The last\ntime he&rsquo;d ever felt like this, he&rsquo;d caused an all out war and he still doesn&rsquo;t\nremember why he&rsquo;s banned from Palermo.

You had potions and magic, how can you not instantly feel better?&rdquo;</p><p>Well buddy, when you&rsquo;re throwing up the potions that make you &ldquo;feel better&rdquo; then you&rsquo;re not getting the parts of the potion to make you healthy again now are you?! </p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry for yelling, but it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve been sick without my mom taking care of me. I miss her and even though I know she&rsquo;s technically not my mom and she in fact kidnapped me, but she&rsquo;s the mom I know and love. I miss her and being sick without her warm hugs and chicken noodle soup reminded me of how much I missed her. </p><p>I&rsquo;m still sick (and contagious) so I may not post much any time soon. But Christmas is coming up and I&rsquo;m curious as to what this year what Santa will bring! </p>",
