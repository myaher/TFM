        "body": "<p>I was having this discussion with <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRi099CEADAL4CvQwneF5qw\">@argentvive</a> yesterday, about the fate of the Stark sisters. Well, I haven\u2019t made my mind about Sansa yet, but I realized something unsettling about Arya.\u00a0</p><p>Lady\u2019s death, in season 1, somewhat foreshadowed Arya\u2019s training with servants of the many faces God. The faceless men have a very\u00a0\u201cmaterialistic\u201d view of lives: victims are sometime (often) arbitrarily chosen. It doesn\u2019t matter who they are or what they\u2019ve done; all that matter is that they need to die\u00a0\u201cbecause the many faces God wants it\u201d. Lady Crane, and to a lesser extent the\u00a0\u201ctickler\u201d of Harrenhal were the unlucky chosen (although the tickler kinda deserved it). The situation with Sansa\u2019s direwolf was similar: Lady was killed for a purely materialistic purpose. Cersei wanted a wolf killed, and it fell on Lady because it was convenient. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not Lady deserved it. Even then, however, Arya had a part to play in Lady\u2019s death. It wasn\u2019t her fault, and I\u2019ll never blame her for it, but the situation as a whole - basically switching Nymeria for Lady, because in the end, it didn\u2019t matter to Cersei (who\u2019d be the metaphorical\u00a0\u201cmany faces God\u201d in here) - came dangerously close to the\u00a0\u201ckilling policy\u201d of the faceless men.\u00a0</p><p>Every starkling still alive by season 7 have undergone a form of death: Jon died literally. Bran died in the cave with Summer. A part of Sansa died when Lady was executed. As for Arya, she died when she sailed for Braavos: She was given a coin from Jaqen H\u2019ghar - her\u00a0\u201cpass\u201d for the House of Black and White\u201d - and crossed the sea to join a guild of assassins who worship the god of death. From a mythological perspective, it reminds us of the coin payed by the dead to Charon, so he can sail them across the Styx and to the Underworld.\u00a0</p><p>However, Arya eventually transgresses the rules of the\u00a0\u201cUnderworld\u201d; metaphorically by sailing back to Westeros (the crossing of the Styx is supposed to be a one way trip, obviously), and also literally, by showing the finger to the many faces god: she goes on to uses her newly gained powers - switching faces - for her own agenda, NOT the agenda of the many faces god. In the House of Black and White, such a behavior wasn\u2019t gonna go unpunished (she goes blind, the waif attempts to murder her), but in Westeros, Arya would be free to do as she pleases&hellip; or will she?</p><p>My main concern for Arya is that she won\u2019t be able to cheat the many faces god for much longer. What that means, exactly, I\u2019m not sure, but we can speculate. For instance, we know that, before sailing for Braavos, Arya spent much of her time on the run from Cersei, the\u00a0\u201cwesterosi equivalent\u201d of the many faces god. Even back then, her main asset was her\u00a0\u201cface-switching\u201d ability: she would disguise herself, change her name, pass as a boy. Season 7 onward, Arya\u2019s goal in Westeros is to kill Cersei; ironically, the \u201cgod\u201d she\u2019s been running away from. So all in all, my endgame prediction for Arya is, either she\u2019ll kill Cersei, or Cersei will kill <i>her</i>.\u00a0</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>P.S sorry for the grammar mistakes.

        "body": "<h1>Feminine Rebellion In ASOIAF</h1><p>One of the things I love most about ASOIAF is how carefully crafted each of the female main characters are.  GRRM has taken so much time to create meaningful characters that aren\u2019t stereotypical, sexist, or caricatured.  Though each female character is unique and shows a different perspective of what it\u2019s like to live in such an incredibly patriarchal society, I think the three I find most interesting are Sansa, Arya, and Cersei. \u00a0Each of them shows one of the three main ways a woman can react to the expectations a patriarchal society places on them. \u00a0Sansa reacts by fully embracing society\u2019s expectations of her, Arya reacts by rejecting the expectations she\u2019s not naturally suited for and pursuing other skills, and Cersei reacts by becoming embittered towards everybody, but especially other women she views as not fighting hard enough for her idea of women\u2019s equality in Westeros. \u00a0In their own way each of these points of views is fighting against the sexist society they\u2019re living in (some in a much healthier way than others). \u00a0It\u2019s fascinating what can be learned from the perspective of each of these three women, and I love that GRRM gave us these contrasting characters. \u00a0I think understanding how each of them relates to the societal expectations around them is crucial to understanding them fully as characters, so it\u2019s worthwhile to break down each of these reactions to patriarchal society:</p><p><b>Sansa</b></p><p>Of all the female perspectives in ASOIAF, Sansa\u2019s rebellion against her circumstances is often the most subtle, but it is effective and important nonetheless. \u00a0Though Sansa has mostly catered to the Westerosi male standard of what a woman \u201cshould be\u201d (she excels at activities like needlework, is polite to a fault, and constantly thinks about the duties of a Lady) she still uses these attributes to help those around her and put herself in a better social position. \u00a0Despite being ridiculed endlessly by the likes of Cersei, Joffrey, and the Hound for her kindness and pleasantries, she still never gives up on her ideal of what a true Lady should be. \u00a0Instead of allowing her situation to make her bitter and resentful, she stays resiliently gentle throughout her whole arch, even when she\u2019s in the throes of depression.  Just because her rebellions against society are gentle doesn\u2019t make them any less worthwhile. \u00a0Each time she refuses to play the part that\u2019s expected of her, even when it\u2019s subtle, ends up leading to a defining character moment or to an improvement in her circumstance \u2013 for instance, the Hound expects her to play the role of scared little girl, but instead she remains polite and caring just as a lady should, choosing to comfort him instead of shy away from him, which leads to him protecting her later. \u00a0This type of scenario happens over and over again \u2013 her decision to show no outer signs of distress while Joffrey torments her so as not to allow him the satisfaction, her choosing to de-stress the guests in Maegor\u2019s Holdfast during Blackwater when Cersei expects her to beg for her life. \u00a0Westeros\u2019s patriarchal society has forced roles upon Sansa, expecting her to be weak because of them, but instead she takes every opportunity to prove that courtesy, kindness, and goodness are strengths that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. \u00a0It should also be noted that Sansa\u2019s strength can be seen in more obvious rebellions, like her actually physically fighting against her marriage to Tyrion:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'><b>\u201cSansa tried to run, but Cersei&rsquo;s handmaid caught her before she&rsquo;d gone a yard.

            "comment": "<p><h1>Feminine Rebellion In ASOIAF</h1><p>One of the things I love most about ASOIAF is how carefully crafted each of the female main characters are.  GRRM has taken so much time to create meaningful characters that aren\u2019t stereotypical, sexist, or caricatured.  Though each female character is unique and shows a different perspective of what it\u2019s like to live in such an incredibly patriarchal society, I think the three I find most interesting are Sansa, Arya, and Cersei. \u00a0Each of them shows one of the three main ways a woman can react to the expectations a patriarchal society places on them. \u00a0Sansa reacts by fully embracing society\u2019s expectations of her, Arya reacts by rejecting the expectations she\u2019s not naturally suited for and pursuing other skills, and Cersei reacts by becoming embittered towards everybody, but especially other women she views as not fighting hard enough for her idea of women\u2019s equality in Westeros. \u00a0In their own way each of these points of views is fighting against the sexist society they\u2019re living in (some in a much healthier way than others). \u00a0It\u2019s fascinating what can be learned from the perspective of each of these three women, and I love that GRRM gave us these contrasting characters. \u00a0I think understanding how each of them relates to the societal expectations around them is crucial to understanding them fully as characters, so it\u2019s worthwhile to break down each of these reactions to patriarchal society:</p><p><b>Sansa</b></p><p>Of all the female perspectives in ASOIAF, Sansa\u2019s rebellion against her circumstances is often the most subtle, but it is effective and important nonetheless. \u00a0Though Sansa has mostly catered to the Westerosi male standard of what a woman \u201cshould be\u201d (she excels at activities like needlework, is polite to a fault, and constantly thinks about the duties of a Lady) she still uses these attributes to help those around her and put herself in a better social position. \u00a0Despite being ridiculed endlessly by the likes of Cersei, Joffrey, and the Hound for her kindness and pleasantries, she still never gives up on her ideal of what a true Lady should be. \u00a0Instead of allowing her situation to make her bitter and resentful, she stays resiliently gentle throughout her whole arch, even when she\u2019s in the throes of depression.  Just because her rebellions against society are gentle doesn\u2019t make them any less worthwhile. \u00a0Each time she refuses to play the part that\u2019s expected of her, even when it\u2019s subtle, ends up leading to a defining character moment or to an improvement in her circumstance \u2013 for instance, the Hound expects her to play the role of scared little girl, but instead she remains polite and caring just as a lady should, choosing to comfort him instead of shy away from him, which leads to him protecting her later. \u00a0This type of scenario happens over and over again \u2013 her decision to show no outer signs of distress while Joffrey torments her so as not to allow him the satisfaction, her choosing to de-stress the guests in Maegor\u2019s Holdfast during Blackwater when Cersei expects her to beg for her life. \u00a0Westeros\u2019s patriarchal society has forced roles upon Sansa, expecting her to be weak because of them, but instead she takes every opportunity to prove that courtesy, kindness, and goodness are strengths that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. \u00a0It should also be noted that Sansa\u2019s strength can be seen in more obvious rebellions, like her actually physically fighting against her marriage to Tyrion:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'><b>\u201cSansa tried to run, but Cersei\u2019s handmaid caught her before she\u2019d gone a yard.

                "content": "<p><h1>Feminine Rebellion In ASOIAF</h1><p>One of the things I love most about ASOIAF is how carefully crafted each of the female main characters are.  GRRM has taken so much time to create meaningful characters that aren&rsquo;t stereotypical, sexist, or caricatured.  Though each female character is unique and shows a different perspective of what it&rsquo;s like to live in such an incredibly patriarchal society, I think the three I find most interesting are Sansa, Arya, and Cersei. &nbsp;Each of them shows one of the three main ways a woman can react to the expectations a patriarchal society places on them. &nbsp;Sansa reacts by fully embracing society&rsquo;s expectations of her, Arya reacts by rejecting the expectations she&rsquo;s not naturally suited for and pursuing other skills, and Cersei reacts by becoming embittered towards everybody, but especially other women she views as not fighting hard enough for her idea of women&rsquo;s equality in Westeros. &nbsp;In their own way each of these points of views is fighting against the sexist society they&rsquo;re living in (some in a much healthier way than others). &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fascinating what can be learned from the perspective of each of these three women, and I love that GRRM gave us these contrasting characters. &nbsp;I think understanding how each of them relates to the societal expectations around them is crucial to understanding them fully as characters, so it&rsquo;s worthwhile to break down each of these reactions to patriarchal society:</p><p><b>Sansa</b></p><p>Of all the female perspectives in ASOIAF, Sansa&rsquo;s rebellion against her circumstances is often the most subtle, but it is effective and important nonetheless. &nbsp;Though Sansa has mostly catered to the Westerosi male standard of what a woman &ldquo;should be&rdquo; (she excels at activities like needlework, is polite to a fault, and constantly thinks about the duties of a Lady) she still uses these attributes to help those around her and put herself in a better social position. &nbsp;Despite being ridiculed endlessly by the likes of Cersei, Joffrey, and the Hound for her kindness and pleasantries, she still never gives up on her ideal of what a true Lady should be. &nbsp;Instead of allowing her situation to make her bitter and resentful, she stays resiliently gentle throughout her whole arch, even when she&rsquo;s in the throes of depression.  Just because her rebellions against society are gentle doesn&rsquo;t make them any less worthwhile. &nbsp;Each time she refuses to play the part that&rsquo;s expected of her, even when it&rsquo;s subtle, ends up leading to a defining character moment or to an improvement in her circumstance &ndash; for instance, the Hound expects her to play the role of scared little girl, but instead she remains polite and caring just as a lady should, choosing to comfort him instead of shy away from him, which leads to him protecting her later. &nbsp;This type of scenario happens over and over again &ndash; her decision to show no outer signs of distress while Joffrey torments her so as not to allow him the satisfaction, her choosing to de-stress the guests in Maegor&rsquo;s Holdfast during Blackwater when Cersei expects her to beg for her life. &nbsp;Westeros&rsquo;s patriarchal society has forced roles upon Sansa, expecting her to be weak because of them, but instead she takes every opportunity to prove that courtesy, kindness, and goodness are strengths that shouldn&rsquo;t be underestimated. &nbsp;It should also be noted that Sansa&rsquo;s strength can be seen in more obvious rebellions, like her actually physically fighting against her marriage to Tyrion:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\"><b>&ldquo;Sansa tried to run, but Cersei&rsquo;s handmaid caught her before she&rsquo;d gone a yard. Ser Meryn Trant gave her a look that made her cringe, but Kettleblack touched her almost gently and said, &lsquo;Do as you&rsquo;re told, sweetling, it won&rsquo;t be so bad. Wolves are supposed to be brave, aren&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;</b></p><p><b>Brave. Sansa took a deep breath. I am a Stark, yes, I can be brave.&rdquo;</b></p><p>-&nbsp;<b>Sansa III, A Storm of Swords</b></p><p><b>Arya</b></p><p>Though some people view Arya as a simple tomboy, her character is actually much more complex than that. &nbsp;Arya is naturally considerably less suited for Westeros&rsquo;s idea of what a highborn lady should be, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she doesn&rsquo;t wish she was suited for life as a lady:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\"><b>&ldquo;Arya&rsquo;s stitches were crooked again. &nbsp;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa&rsquo;s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so.&rdquo;</b></p><p>-&nbsp;<b>Arya I, A Game of Thrones</b></p><p>She is upset by the fact that she isn&rsquo;t as capable of lady-like activities as Sansa is, and that constant feeling of inadequacy is mostly what&rsquo;s driven her to pursuing other interests like swordplay. &nbsp;But rather than wallow in her feelings of inadequacy, she embraces the talents she&rsquo;s better suited for. &nbsp;One of my favorite things about her character is that she never lingers too long on the conflict of her refusal to meet society&rsquo;s expectations. &nbsp;Instead of worrying about her identity as a female in a patriarchal society, she just digs deeper into her identity as a &ldquo;wolf&rdquo;:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\"><b>&ldquo;Arya was a trial, it must be said. Half a boy and half a wolf pup. Forbid her anything and it became her heart&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</b></p><p>-&nbsp;<b>Catelyn VII, A Clash of Kings</b></p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\"><b>&ldquo;Yes, Arya thought. Yes, it&rsquo;s you who ought to run, you and Lord Tywin and the Mountain and Ser Addam and Ser Amory and stupid Ser Lyonel whoever he is, all of you better run or my brother will kill you, he&rsquo;s a Stark, he&rsquo;s more wolf than man, and so am I.&rdquo;</b></p><p>-&nbsp;<b>Arya VIII, A Clash of Kings</b></p><p>Though Arya takes every chance she can get to rebel against the expectations Westeros has for women, it&rsquo;s never a conscious decision she decided to make &ndash; it&rsquo;s just her nature:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;quote&quot;}\"><b>&ldquo;&rsquo;You look different now.
