Benji Wilson\ndiscovers how Pratchett\u2019s dying wish came true</p><p><br/></p><p>\tHeaven, as it turns\nout, is in an industrial park in Weybridge. The old Samsung building,\nwith floor-to-ceiling windows and lighting so bright you have to\nsquint, is the celestial set for Good Omens, the BBC and Amazon\u2019s\nTV adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\u2019s beloved fantasy\nnovel. The floor, in particular, is attracting attention from Jon\nHamm, who plays the angel Gabriel.</p><p>\t\u201cDid we put this\nfloor in?\u201d he asks, wearing a power suit and looking more Wall\nStreet CEO than heavenly host. When he looks down, he sees his own\nface reflected. \u201cI mean, who orders up a silver floor? Of all the\nchoices.\u201d Then an angel rides by on a hoverboard. \u201cThis,\u201d Hamm\nsays, \u201cis insane.\u201d</p><p>\tMuch of Good Omens\ncould be described that way. Were he alive, Terry Pratchett would\nprobably delight in the description. It tells the story of an angel,\nAziraphale, and a demon, Crowley, played by Michael Sheen and David\nTennant respectively. They have been on Earth since the Garden of\nEden, working for their opposing teams in heaven and hell, one\nlighting fires, the other putting them out. Over the centuries, they\nhave become friends.</p><p>\tWe first meet them\nas the Antichrist is being delivered to Earth \u2013 indeed, one of\nCrowley\u2019s missions is to deliver the Antichrist to the maternity\nward. But they both realise this means the end of humanity as we know\nit, and, as Tennant puts it, \u201cCrowley and Aziraphale have quite a\nnice time on earth. They quite enjoy the dinners and the wine and the\nlifestyle.\u201d</p><p>\tSo they get\ntogether to decide they\u2019re going to try to avert the apocalypse.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a comedy,\u201d Sheen says. \u201cIt\u2019s in the vein of\nDouglas Adams and Monty Python. When Neil sent me the first draft of\nthe script, it reminded me of Whoops Apocalypse [Andrew Marshall and\nDavid Renwick\u2019s 1982 ITV comedy set in the weeks leading up to the\nend of the world.] I remember watching that when I was a kid and\nfinding it funny but also quite scary. It\u2019s hard to know what my\n14-year\u2014old self would think of Good Omens, but I imagine it might\nbe similar.\u201d</p><p>\tThis kind of tonal\nmash-up intermingling humanity\u2019s most momentous concerns with the\nquotidian minutiae of \u201cwhere did I leave my keys?\u201d, is\nnotoriously hard to pull off. For a start, there\u2019s the scope of it:\nGood Omens has been in production since mid-2017 and has had to\nrecreate not merely heaven and hell, but all of Christian history in\nbetween. The beginning of episode three features a sequence catching\nup with Aziraphale and Crowley at the Garden of Eden, Noah\u2019s Ark,\nthe crucifixion, ancient Rome, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, the crucible of\nthe French Revolution and on, via the world wards, to the present. We\nsee their relationship developing down the aeons. It\u2019s all been\ndone in less than 20 minutes.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s basically\na collection of single scenes,\u201d Tennant says when I speak to him in\na church in an Oxfordshire village. (He\u2019s about to go outside and\ntake delivery of the Antichrist.) \u201cBut for one of those scenes we\ngot Shakespeare\u2019s Globe for a day. For another, we transformed St\nJames\u2019s Park into Edwardian England for a day. For one scene. It\u2019s\nfantastic to be able to work on something that has those sort of\nresources. You wouldn\u2019t really be able to tell this story\notherwise.\u201d</p><p>\tResources means\nAmazon\u2019s money. That, and the allure of Gaiman\u2019s writing, has\ndrawn in a supporting cast including Frances McDormand as the voice\nof God, alongside Hamm, Jack Whitehall, Michael McKeen and Miranda\nRichardson. With a Game of Thrones-shaped hole to be filled, Good\nOmens is supposed to be a very big deal indeed.</p><p>\tYet Gaiman, who\nco-wrote the original novel, adapted it for the screen and is the\nshowrunner, would happily not have made it at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nreally plan to give 18 months of my life to making a TV show. I\u2019d\nmuch rather be writing novels. I would be making a lot more money\nwriting novels. Nobody would be telling me what to do and my wife\nwouldn\u2019t be complaining about not seeing me. But on the other hand,\nthis,\u201d he says, pointing at the shiny floor and Hamm running\nthrough lines as Gabriel, \u201cwas what Terry wanted to happen. And\nhe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\tGood Omens was\npublished in 1990. There followed almost 20 years of fruitless\nattempts to turn it into a film. Terry Gilliam received a\nprepublication copy of the book asking for a cover blurb. He\nmisplaced the letter that came with it and thought he was being sent\na story that might work for his next film.

The old Samsung building,\nwith floor-to-ceiling windows and lighting so bright you have to\nsquint, is the celestial set for Good Omens, the BBC and Amazon\u2019s\nTV adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\u2019s beloved fantasy\nnovel. The floor, in particular, is attracting attention from Jon\nHamm, who plays the angel Gabriel.</p><p>\t\u201cDid we put this\nfloor in?\u201d he asks, wearing a power suit and looking more Wall\nStreet CEO than heavenly host. When he looks down, he sees his own\nface reflected. \u201cI mean, who orders up a silver floor? Of all the\nchoices.\u201d Then an angel rides by on a hoverboard. \u201cThis,\u201d Hamm\nsays, \u201cis insane.\u201d</p><p>\tMuch of Good Omens\ncould be described that way. Were he alive, Terry Pratchett would\nprobably delight in the description. It tells the story of an angel,\nAziraphale, and a demon, Crowley, played by Michael Sheen and David\nTennant respectively. They have been on Earth since the Garden of\nEden, working for their opposing teams in heaven and hell, one\nlighting fires, the other putting them out. Over the centuries, they\nhave become friends.</p><p>\tWe first meet them\nas the Antichrist is being delivered to Earth \u2013 indeed, one of\nCrowley\u2019s missions is to deliver the Antichrist to the maternity\nward. But they both realise this means the end of humanity as we know\nit, and, as Tennant puts it, \u201cCrowley and Aziraphale have quite a\nnice time on earth. They quite enjoy the dinners and the wine and the\nlifestyle.\u201d</p><p>\tSo they get\ntogether to decide they\u2019re going to try to avert the apocalypse.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a comedy,\u201d Sheen says. \u201cIt\u2019s in the vein of\nDouglas Adams and Monty Python. When Neil sent me the first draft of\nthe script, it reminded me of Whoops Apocalypse [Andrew Marshall and\nDavid Renwick\u2019s 1982 ITV comedy set in the weeks leading up to the\nend of the world.] I remember watching that when I was a kid and\nfinding it funny but also quite scary. It\u2019s hard to know what my\n14-year\u2014old self would think of Good Omens, but I imagine it might\nbe similar.\u201d</p><p>\tThis kind of tonal\nmash-up intermingling humanity\u2019s most momentous concerns with the\nquotidian minutiae of \u201cwhere did I leave my keys?\u201d, is\nnotoriously hard to pull off. For a start, there\u2019s the scope of it:\nGood Omens has been in production since mid-2017 and has had to\nrecreate not merely heaven and hell, but all of Christian history in\nbetween. The beginning of episode three features a sequence catching\nup with Aziraphale and Crowley at the Garden of Eden, Noah\u2019s Ark,\nthe crucifixion, ancient Rome, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, the crucible of\nthe French Revolution and on, via the world wards, to the present. We\nsee their relationship developing down the aeons. It\u2019s all been\ndone in less than 20 minutes.</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s basically\na collection of single scenes,\u201d Tennant says when I speak to him in\na church in an Oxfordshire village. (He\u2019s about to go outside and\ntake delivery of the Antichrist.) \u201cBut for one of those scenes we\ngot Shakespeare\u2019s Globe for a day. For another, we transformed St\nJames\u2019s Park into Edwardian England for a day. For one scene. It\u2019s\nfantastic to be able to work on something that has those sort of\nresources. You wouldn\u2019t really be able to tell this story\notherwise.\u201d</p><p>\tResources means\nAmazon\u2019s money. That, and the allure of Gaiman\u2019s writing, has\ndrawn in a supporting cast including Frances McDormand as the voice\nof God, alongside Hamm, Jack Whitehall, Michael McKeen and Miranda\nRichardson. With a Game of Thrones-shaped hole to be filled, Good\nOmens is supposed to be a very big deal indeed.</p><p>\tYet Gaiman, who\nco-wrote the original novel, adapted it for the screen and is the\nshowrunner, would happily not have made it at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t\nreally plan to give 18 months of my life to making a TV show. I\u2019d\nmuch rather be writing novels. I would be making a lot more money\nwriting novels. Nobody would be telling me what to do and my wife\nwouldn\u2019t be complaining about not seeing me. But on the other hand,\nthis,\u201d he says, pointing at the shiny floor and Hamm running\nthrough lines as Gabriel, \u201cwas what Terry wanted to happen. And\nhe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\tGood Omens was\npublished in 1990. There followed almost 20 years of fruitless\nattempts to turn it into a film. Terry Gilliam received a\nprepublication copy of the book asking for a cover blurb. He\nmisplaced the letter that came with it and thought he was being sent\na story that might work for his next film.

                "content": "<p>The Sunday Times\narticle</p><p><br /></p><p>DEMON DAZE</p><p><br /></p><p>After almost 30\nyears, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s comic fantasy Good Omens\nhas made it to the screen &ndash; and in lavish fashion. Benji Wilson\ndiscovers how Pratchett&rsquo;s dying wish came true</p><p><br /></p><p>\tHeaven, as it turns\nout, is in an industrial park in Weybridge. The old Samsung building,\nwith floor-to-ceiling windows and lighting so bright you have to\nsquint, is the celestial set for Good Omens, the BBC and Amazon&rsquo;s\nTV adaptation of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s beloved fantasy\nnovel. The floor, in particular, is attracting attention from Jon\nHamm, who plays the angel Gabriel.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Did we put this\nfloor in?&rdquo; he asks, wearing a power suit and looking more Wall\nStreet CEO than heavenly host. When he looks down, he sees his own\nface reflected. &ldquo;I mean, who orders up a silver floor? Of all the\nchoices.&rdquo; Then an angel rides by on a hoverboard. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Hamm\nsays, &ldquo;is insane.&rdquo;</p><p>\tMuch of Good Omens\ncould be described that way. Were he alive, Terry Pratchett would\nprobably delight in the description. It tells the story of an angel,\nAziraphale, and a demon, Crowley, played by Michael Sheen and David\nTennant respectively. They have been on Earth since the Garden of\nEden, working for their opposing teams in heaven and hell, one\nlighting fires, the other putting them out. Over the centuries, they\nhave become friends.</p><p>\tWe first meet them\nas the Antichrist is being delivered to Earth &ndash; indeed, one of\nCrowley&rsquo;s missions is to deliver the Antichrist to the maternity\nward. But they both realise this means the end of humanity as we know\nit, and, as Tennant puts it, &ldquo;Crowley and Aziraphale have quite a\nnice time on earth. They quite enjoy the dinners and the wine and the\nlifestyle.&rdquo;</p><p>\tSo they get\ntogether to decide they&rsquo;re going to try to avert the apocalypse.\n&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a comedy,&rdquo; Sheen says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the vein of\nDouglas Adams and Monty Python. When Neil sent me the first draft of\nthe script, it reminded me of Whoops Apocalypse [Andrew Marshall and\nDavid Renwick&rsquo;s 1982 ITV comedy set in the weeks leading up to the\nend of the world.] I remember watching that when I was a kid and\nfinding it funny but also quite scary. It&rsquo;s hard to know what my\n14-year&mdash;old self would think of Good Omens, but I imagine it might\nbe similar.&rdquo;</p><p>\tThis kind of tonal\nmash-up intermingling humanity&rsquo;s most momentous concerns with the\nquotidian minutiae of &ldquo;where did I leave my keys?&rdquo;, is\nnotoriously hard to pull off. For a start, there&rsquo;s the scope of it:\nGood Omens has been in production since mid-2017 and has had to\nrecreate not merely heaven and hell, but all of Christian history in\nbetween. The beginning of episode three features a sequence catching\nup with Aziraphale and Crowley at the Garden of Eden, Noah&rsquo;s Ark,\nthe crucifixion, ancient Rome, Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe, the crucible of\nthe French Revolution and on, via the world wards, to the present. We\nsee their relationship developing down the aeons. It&rsquo;s all been\ndone in less than 20 minutes.</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically\na collection of single scenes,&rdquo; Tennant says when I speak to him in\na church in an Oxfordshire village. (He&rsquo;s about to go outside and\ntake delivery of the Antichrist.) &ldquo;But for one of those scenes we\ngot Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe for a day. For another, we transformed St\nJames&rsquo;s Park into Edwardian England for a day. For one scene. It&rsquo;s\nfantastic to be able to work on something that has those sort of\nresources. You wouldn&rsquo;t really be able to tell this story\notherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>\tResources means\nAmazon&rsquo;s money. That, and the allure of Gaiman&rsquo;s writing, has\ndrawn in a supporting cast including Frances McDormand as the voice\nof God, alongside Hamm, Jack Whitehall, Michael McKeen and Miranda\nRichardson. With a Game of Thrones-shaped hole to be filled, Good\nOmens is supposed to be a very big deal indeed.</p><p>\tYet Gaiman, who\nco-wrote the original novel, adapted it for the screen and is the\nshowrunner, would happily not have made it at all. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t\nreally plan to give 18 months of my life to making a TV show. I&rsquo;d\nmuch rather be writing novels. I would be making a lot more money\nwriting novels. Nobody would be telling me what to do and my wife\nwouldn&rsquo;t be complaining about not seeing me. But on the other hand,\nthis,&rdquo; he says, pointing at the shiny floor and Hamm running\nthrough lines as Gabriel, &ldquo;was what Terry wanted to happen. And\nhe&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo;</p><p>\tGood Omens was\npublished in 1990. There followed almost 20 years of fruitless\nattempts to turn it into a film. Terry Gilliam received a\nprepublication copy of the book asking for a cover blurb. He\nmisplaced the letter that came with it and thought he was being sent\na story that might work for his next film. He loved it, but, as so\noften with Gilliam&rsquo;s grand visions, Hollywood got in the way.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Terry\n[Pratchett] and I decided that we wanted it to be television six\nyears ago,&rdquo; Gaiman says. &ldquo;We went went looking for a writer &ndash;\nboth of us were too busy &ndash; but basically we couldn&rsquo;t find one.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPratchett died in\nMarch 2015. As he was overtaken by Alzheimer&rsquo;s in his final years,\nhe wrote Gaiman a letter &ndash; something he had never done before. &ldquo;He\nsaid, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the only other person out there with the same love\nand understanding and passion for this that I have. I know how busy\nyou are, but I want to see this before the darkness takes me. Will\nyou do this, please?&rsquo; In 35 years, he&rsquo;d never asked me anything\nbefore. So I said yes. And then he died. So suddenly I was dealing\nwith a last request. And I&rsquo;m honouring it.&rdquo;</p><p>\tGaiman and Sheen\nhave been friends since the actor mentioned in an interview about a\ndecade ago that Gaiman was one of his favourite writers, across\nnovels and comic books. Gaiman happened to read this, and sent Sheen\na selection of special editions with a card saying &ldquo;From one fan to\nanother.&rdquo; Since then, Sheen has appeared in Gaiman&rsquo;s episode of\nDoctor Who, and now stars in Good Omens. Part of their friendship is\nbased on a shared love of science fiction &ndash; Sheen only mentioned\nGaiman in that interview in order to make a point about genre snobs.\nMany of his favourite writers, he said, worked in fantasy and SF.</p><p>\tSheen says the\nsnobbery still pertains - &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re of a mindset that anything\nwritten in a science-fiction context just can&rsquo;t be great\nliterature, then I don&rsquo;t think anything is going to change your\nmind&rdquo; - adding that there&rsquo;s a similar prejudice against comedy as\nhigh art.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Comedy films are\nalways seen as impossible to be great films. They&rsquo;re rarely winning\nOscars. Good Omens ticks both boxes, comedy and fantasy &ndash; and I\nlike that. When I was growing up, two of the biggest influences on me\nin terms of how I see art were The South Bank Show on TV and Kenneth\nTynan, especially his profiles. Neither of them made a distinction\nbetween high and low art. One week is was Shostakovich , the next\nBilly Connolly. Tynan would profile Brecht, then Morecambe and Wise.\nI loved that.&rdquo;</p><p>\tJust because Good\nOmens is funny, he goes on, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s glib. &ldquo;I was\nlooking at a scene today when one of the angels says it&rsquo;s been\nwritten that the end of the world begins with unrest in the Middle\nEast, and the Antichrist is being taken to the Pains of Megiddo. I&rsquo;ve\nseen that being written in newspaper articles &ndash; Isis are trying to\nengineer a situation where this battle takes place in a certain\nlocation because that&rsquo;s &lsquo;what was written&rsquo;. People actually\nthink that Trump is the coming of the Christ. Or the Antichrist.\nPeople are actually talking about this in fairly mainstream circles.</p><p>\t&ldquo;That gives Good\nOmens a difficult context to when the book came out. You&rsquo;ve got\nthese two main characters who are very much in their own echo\nchambers &ndash; or should be.

It does give an added piquancy that the\nworld might not be as stable as we thought it was a couple of years\nago. By the time this article is printed, who knows where we&rsquo;ll\nbe?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><i>Good Omens is on\nAmazon Prime Video from May 31 and will air on BBC2 at the end of the\nyear.</i></p>",
