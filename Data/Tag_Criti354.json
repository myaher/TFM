It\ncontains torture, general creepy content, and the big thing, an\nemotionally abusive teacher-student dynamic. (NOT a sexual one\nbecause that\u2019s not my headcanon and also holy shit, this situation\nis already upsetting enough&hellip; but it still might be triggering to\nsome, so be aware.) Also as a further content note it contains\nteenagers who are probably like 17 at the time (if I\u2019m getting my\ntimeline right) having relationships with people their own age, though nothing explicit. \n</i></p><p><i>Credit\nto my darling <a>@valarhalla</a>\u200b \u2013 who is not even in this fandom \u2013 for helping\nprovide me with many adorable German terms of endearment. Any\nlanguage mistakes that remain are my own. Also, the title is from the song Atticus by the Noisettes, which isn\u2019t actually very related in the rest of its lyrics but I do love that phrasing and I think it fits.<br/></i></p></blockquote><hr><p>Here\u2019s\nhow it is: there are three of them, always the three of them\ntogether. They are just children, at the beginning.</p><p>At\nthe end, they are something else entirely. \n</p><!-- more --><p>They\nare eleven years old and they are friends already, even before they\nare accepted into the Academy. Even before they meet the man who will\nsee something special in them, pluck them from amongst its ranks of\nbrilliance, of students who hold promise. \n</p><p>The\nnight they find out they will all be going together, Eodwulf and\nCaleb sneak out of their homes, climbing the tree in Astrid\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s garden. There is a rickety little treehouse up there, and\nthe three of them sit and look at the stars until the dawn comes.\nIt\u2019s summer, and it\u2019s warm even in these cool northern latitudes,\nand the night is fragrant and bright with possibility.</p><p>After\nall, everything they could have possibly wanted and more is before\nthem; they need only reach out and take it.</p><hr><p>Blumenthal\nhas never had three of its children honoured so; they throw a\nfestival for them in the village square, a sent-off party one long\nnight near the end of summer. They all wear their best. Someone has\ngiven Eodwulf a crown of pink flowers. It suits him; he has dark skin\nand black hair, and the colour looks good against it, Caleb thinks.\nThe crown\u2019s a little too big and falls down over one eye as he\ngrins shyly at the others. Someone grabs Astrid\u2019s arm and puts one\non her too. It\u2019s yellow, matching her golden-brown skin, her mane\nof hair the colour of old, dusty gold woven into a long braid. She\npushes her thick, wire-rimmed glasses up her nose and squares her\nshoulders in determination, as though she is carrying the full weight\nand responsibility of a true crown. \n</p><p>Caleb\nhas a crown too; his is blue as the summer sky, and the pollen and\nthe scent makes him sneeze a little as a few petals fall down over\nhis face.</p><p>He\nwears it all evening, taking it off at night and laying it on his\nbedside table when he goes to sleep in his own bed for the last time.\nHe will return to Blumenthal, he knows this. But he\u2019s not sure that\nit will ever feel like home anymore, with the bright future stretched\nout before him, the path just waiting for him to walk down it.</p><hr><p>They\nhave been at the academy for a few years when they are told that they\nhave been chosen to be taught privately by Master Trent Ikithon.\nThey\u2019ve actually heard of him before; whispers abound, he\u2019s one\nof the greatest arcanists in the whole Empire, he\u2019s uniquely\ncommitted to both the defence of the realm and the training of the\nmost talented young mages, the best and brightest. He\u2019s tough, it\u2019s\nrumoured; he will not take anything other than the very best, and he\nwill punish failure harshly. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nEodwulf and Astrid cannot stop grinning, as they pack up their few\npossessions for the journey. They know, after all, that if they are\ntogether then they are three times as strong, three times as clever\nand talented. \n</p><p>The\nfact that all of them were chosen is proof enough of that.</p><hr><p>They\neach have their own strengths, and they must find them and train\nthem; that is Master Ikithon\u2019s very first lesson. \n</p><p>After\nhe takes them into his tutelage, the first two weeks are spent\nassessing their individual abilities. He has their files and progress\nreports from the Academy, of course, the records of the scholarships\nthey were each awarded, letters of recommendation, signed and sealed.\nHe barely touches the files; just as he picked them out, he tells\nthem he prefers to use his own experience with such things, to see\nwith his own eyes. They should too, he says; doing so will make it\neasier for them to bring out their full magical potential. \n</p><p>(They\nall have so much potential; it\u2019s something all three of them have\nknown for years now, but somehow when Master Ikithon says it it holds\nall the more promise. It makes them want to prove him right, to show\nhim what they are, and what they can be.)</p><p>They\nwill each complete their full, comprehensive education in history,\nreligion, a variety of languages both common and rare, mathematics,\nrhetoric, politics, natural philosophy, and of course magic. But in\nthis last, they must choose the areas they want to specialise in. \n</p><p>Most\nmages, Master Ikithon tells them, wait until later on in their\neducation to choose a school of magic to specialise in. <i>But you\nthree</i>, he says, smiling at them, <i>are not most mages</i>. They\nare the very brightest young minds in the Empire, and his course of\nstudy will be duly accelerated and advanced. And so they will each\npick a school of magic \u2013 or two if they choose, as ambition is to\nbe encouraged - to study, according to their strengths and their\ninterests once they discover them. They will have to work hard, he\nwarns them; they are not here for an easy few years. But if they\napply themselves then they will rise amongst the ranks of the\nAcademy, then go on to defend the Empire, and who knows to what\nheights they will ascend? \n</p><p>It\nis what they all want, more than anything. \n</p><p>And\nso, their new master spends some time assessing them. Already it is\nhard, demanding work. He has them show him to spells they already\nknow, subjects them to written tests and interviews them at length\nabout their interests, their hopes and dreams and aspirations. \n</p><p>Eventually,\nthe specialisations are chosen. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nwill study the school of illusion magic, with a secondary focus on\nenchantment. The two can be much greater than the sum of their parts\nwhen used together, their master tells Eodwulf, as he reports it back\nto Caleb and Astrid. It is no small thing to be able to look at a\nperson and enchant them so that they spill out the secret they keep\nlocked deep in their heart, especially if the knowledge can then be\nused to spin them an illusion that can either heal or break them. It\nis hard, on a personal level; this much, Master Ikithon acknowledges.\nBut he believes that Eodwulf can handle it, given proper guidance. \n</p><p>When\nEodwulf tells him this, Caleb agrees, and is happy for him; Eodwulf\nwas always the most empathetic of them, a sensitive and intensely\ncreative child. There is a small, hopeful spark in Eodwulf\u2019s eyes,\nand Caleb is happy for his friend.</p><p>(Caleb\nremembers the older boys who would hurt Eodwulf as a child, would\ntake turns trying to make him cry just because it was easy, because\nthey could. Eodwulf had always hated being so beholden to them, and\nCaleb supposes this is his way of fighting back, many years too\nlate.)</p><p>Astrid\ncomes and tells them that she has chosen to study necromancy, with\nconjuration. Caleb is surprised for a moment, until he thinks about\nit a little more, and then he\u2019s not. Master Ikithon, she explains,\nallowed her a little more choice in what she wanted to study. He had\njudged her the most resilient and hardworking of the three, stable of\nmind and always meticulous. Too many who have had the power to\ncontrol others, to bend the powers of life and death to their will,\nhave fallen off the righteous path, he tells Astrid. But that only\nmakes mages who can control these forces all the more valuable to the\nEmpire, and with her level-headed calm and emotional toughness, he\nbelieves that she is able to handle it. Conjuration, too, takes a\nsteadier hand and an even temperament to get right. \n</p><p>(Caleb\nwonders if Master Ikithon looked deeply enough into all their pasts\nto be aware that Astrid\u2019s brother died the winter he was four and\nshe was nine. She had nearly died too, but she had held on long\nenough by days for the snow to melt and the way to be clear for the\nmedicine to come from the capital to cure her. Since then, she has\nboth feared and been fascinated by death beyond anything else. Caleb\nwonders if this was behind her choice. He does not tell Master\nIkithon this; it\u2019s not his to tell, and he is not asked. He\nsupposes it is likely he knows anyway, though.)</p><p>Caleb\nis called last; he will be specialising jointly in transmutation and\nevocation. A true joint specialisation is a difficult task, not for\nthe complacent. Master Ikithon tells him that he is proud of him, and\nCaleb feels his face glow bright with satisfaction; compliments, from\ntheir master, are rare and precious. \n</p><p>But\nCaleb, his master says, has not only the strongest academic record\nbut also the most raw arcane power underneath it. Transmutation \u2013\nhis own particular area of expertise, no less \u2013 is a natural fit\nfor the academically gifted, as it requires a great deal of knowledge\nof substances, the non-magical basis of chemistry, of alchemy and the\ncomposition of things as they occur naturally in order to understand\nthe fundamental laws that govern the changing of one thing into\nanother. And Caleb will be learning the rigourous first principles;\nMaster Ikithon does not believe in a superficial approach to magical\neducation, and with transmutation in particular a solid grounding is\nvital. \n</p><p>And\nthen he will learn evocation. Here, there comes a warning. Many\npeople think, his teacher tells him, that evocation is all raw,\nuntamed power, righteous fire and destruction. But it is also one of\nthe most dangerous schools of magic for the caster; a good grasp of evocation magic\nis far more about learning control and mastery, lest the power the\nmage wields consume them. Fire, in the right hands, he tells Caleb,\nis as much a creative force as a destructive one.</p><p>He\ntells Caleb that if anyone can wield that power, it is him.</p><p>At\nthe time, Caleb glows with ecstatic joy, and immediately throws\nhimself into his studies.</p><hr><p>(It\ndoes not occur to Caleb until many, many years later that it was\nperhaps no coincidence that none of them were chosen to study\ndivination or abjuration. Seeing through illusions to the truth of\nthings, and evading and defending against magical attacks\u2026 at the\ntime, Caleb though what the others thought, that this was far less\nexciting for a young mage who was set to go far than magic that could\nbe used to attack. Besides, he didn\u2019t think that it was any of\ntheir strengths, and surely he could trust his teacher to be able to\nsee the truth of that from the beginning.)</p><p>(It\nonly strikes him so many years later, but he is a different person by\nthen, a whole new life of broken, jagged pieces replacing the shining\nbright one that he had imagined.)</p><hr><p>They\ncome to think of their master\u2019s house as home. The house is a\nbeautiful one, out in the country, away from the bustle and\npoliticking of Rexxentrum. The mountains march far off in the\ndistance, but the house itself is in a sheltered, green valley, a\nlittle warmer and more sundrenched than the city of marble and metal\nand slate, however grand and elegant it may be to Caleb\u2019s eyes. \n</p><p>Caleb\nloves everything about the valley and their master\u2019s house there.\nHe loves the way that the grass ripples and waves in the wind as they\ncome down the mountain road from the pass in their coach, and he\nloves the pear trees that grow in the sheltered garden. He loves the\nlibrary above all; being surrounded by so many books is a blessing he\nhasn\u2019t yet come to take for granted and probably never will.\nThere\u2019s so many of them, three levels with beautifully carved and\ndark-polished rolling ladders so he doesn\u2019t need to ask anyone if\nhe wants the highest ones. If he\u2019s got no other work to do, he can\njust sit there and read all day, in the reading room where the sun\nfilters down in stripes through the half-shuttered windows with their\ncomfortably-upholstered alcoves. If he wants, he can sit in a window\nseat curled up with a book for hours, and no one will tell him to go\nand do his chores instead because this is his <i>life</i> now, it\u2019s\nall part of his studies and besides, his master is rich enough to\nhave household servants who go about on quiet feet. There\u2019s also a\nwhole walk-in store cupboard of common spell components, which he can\njust take anything from; more dangerous or valuable components are\nkept personally by Master Ikithon, but Caleb knows he only has to ask\nfor it and tell his master why he needs it, and it will be his. \n</p><p>He\nloves that he and Eodwulf and Astrid have rooms next to each other,\nall three in a row. Their rooms open onto a little common sitting\nroom, with a cozy fireplace that they share. In the evenings, after\ndining with their master when he is there, or alone when he is away\non business in Rexxentrum or Zadash, they usually go back there and\ncurl up together on one of the soft chairs. Sometimes, they speak\nabout magic, and their studies, one or other of them showing the\nothers a new spell they\u2019ve learned with pride, or working through\nsomething they\u2019ve been finding difficult to master. Sometimes,\nthough, they just talk, their faces lit by the warm light of the\nfire. They grow close; they were close before of course, Blumenthal\nwas a small village and they\u2019ve all known each other for most of\ntheir lives, have seen each other grow up. But now, they grow closer\nthan they had ever thought possible, sharing their hopes and dreams\nfor the bright future they are bound for. \n</p><p>They\nare all homesick, from time to time. But none of them speak of it;\nthey don\u2019t need to, and besides, even to give voice to such a\nthought would feel wrong, ungrateful. \n</p><p>Besides,\nthey have each other, and as long as the three are together then to\nwhatever greatness they come, they will each always have that little\npiece of their history, reminding them where they came from.</p><p>It\ndoes not occur to any of them that there might come a time when the\nthree of them will not be together. It seems unthinkable, then.</p><hr><p>As\nwell as the lessons that Master Ikithon teaches them all together \u2013\ntheir general studies, and the magical theory and basic spells that\nevery mage should know \u2013 they each have private lessons, once a\nweek for two hours. These sessions take place in Master Ikithon\u2019s\nbrightly lit study, with its wide windows looking out onto the\ngarden, books and wood panelling covering the other three walls.\nCaleb loves these lessons; he sits in a chair at the other side of\nMaster Ikithon\u2019s desk, and his teacher asks him about what he has\nbeen learning that week. The three students spend a lot of time\nreading alone, and it is wonderful to be able to talk about what he\nreads, to ask questions of someone who actually knows the answers. As\na child, Caleb would read every book he could get his hands on, but\nno one in Blumenthal ever had the time or the knowledge for a proper\ndiscussion.</p><p>His\nteacher does. He sits calmly on the other side of his desk, sometimes\nasking a question that is designed to puzzle, to challenge;\nsometimes, Caleb can\u2019t answer them, but that only makes him more\ndetermined to find the answer by the next time. He is meticulous, he\nlikes to get them right; if he makes mistakes, Master Ikithon gets a\nlook of disappointment, a frown line deepening between his eyes,\nwhich grow a little colder. He is the sort of person that makes one\nfeel they must not disappoint.</p><p>After\ntheir discussion, they usually practice some magic; Caleb is learning\nspells as fast as he can, his fingers perpetually stained with ink\nfrom copying them down into one of his many notebooks. He always\nfeels a flicker of nervousness before showing them off though; Master\nIkithon is strong, stronger than any mage in the whole Empire, maybe.\n\n</p><p>He\ndoes not stand for failure in this, either. Magic, Master Ikithon\nsays, when used in the real world, can easily strike down the caster\nif handled incorrectly. It is not a toy but a tool, a weapon, and\nmust be treated as such. \n</p><p>Clumsiness\nand carelessness are thus punished severely. \n</p><p>Caleb\nlets a fireball slip from his control one summer morning as the light\nstreams in the window. It begins to disappate in the air, arcane fire\nsending distortions crackling upwards into the sunlit air above, and\nhe panics, sliding on the carpet to try to grasp the fire again, to\ncatch it back in his fist like a trapped bird. But instead of bending\nto his will, the fire slips from his grasp once more, flaring bright\nbefore vanishing to nothing. \n</p><p>A\nfew papers drift off Master Ikithon\u2019s desk in the downdraft, a\nlittle singed at one edge. They glow but do not catch. Nevertheless\nthey are a little blackened by the time they reach the carpet. \n</p><p>Caleb\nstares at them, his eyes wide as he looks up to meet his master\u2019s;\nsure enough, there is that disappointed look, that slight tightening\nof the mouth, and Caleb\u2019s feels as though his heart were tearing in\ntwo. \n</p><p>There\nare punishments, on days like this. \n</p><hr><p>Caleb\nis back in their common room, laying a rag soaked in a healing potion\non the deep gouges on his upper arm; arcane blades bite deeper than\nthe regular kind, and the pain takes longer to subside. Still, he can\ntake it. As his master says, he is strong, stronger than the others.\nHe deserved this; he\u2019s learned from it. \n</p><p>He\nclenches his fist experimentally, the pain running up his whole\nlacerated arm. The healing potion must be doing its work. When the\ncuts were fresh, he would have been screaming just trying to move his\nfingers, with the tear and burn of ruined skin, gashes deep enough to\ncatch the tendons in his wrist.</p><p>Caleb\ntakes a new rag, dips it in the potion and applies it to his skin. It\nis soothing and tingles a little. \n</p><p>There\nis a store room just for healing potions; they go through many, many\nof them. Their master will be angry with them, after all, if they\nallow his punishments to leave a scar, and so only magical healing\nwill do. After all, to scar them is not his goal. His punishments, he\ntakes pains to tell them, are for the purposes of teaching only. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon is not an inhumane person, after all. He is too indulgent to\nhis students, some at the Academy may even say.</p><p>Caleb\nsighs, looking over at the torn and bloody sleeve of his shirt that\nhe has taken off to clean and heal his arm. He must wash and mend the\nshirt; it was one he brought from home, after all. \n</p><p>Just\nthen, the door opens and in come Astrid and Eodwulf, midway through a\ndiscussion on the differences in casting gestures for holy and arcane\ncasting. Astrid wrote an assigned essay on it last week, and she is\nexplaining it to Eodwulf. \n</p><p>When\nthey see Caleb, they immediately break off speaking. They do not have\nto say anything; this is familiar, a ritual even. Astrid sighs,\nsympathetic, lays a hand on his shoulder in wordless support. Eodwulf\nsits down on the chair next to Caleb, taking the cloth from him and\nbeginning to wash the wounds. Caleb nods gratefully; the wounds are\nnearly fully healed now, the skin visibly knitting together to its\nusual pale, freckled smoothness again, but he appreciates the\ncloseness. Astrid sits down on his other side, heedless of the fact\nthat the deep armchair is only really meant for one, and begins to\ncast prestidigitation to clean Caleb\u2019s bloody shirt. After she is\nfinished, she casts mending, and at once it is good as new. By this\ntime, Eodwulf is finished healing Caleb\u2019s wounds, and the remaining\ndregs of the potion in the dish and the cloth are pink with blood,\nbut his arm is back to normal.</p><p><i>Good</i>.\nHe will need to be able to practice his spells, he thinks. He must\nbecome stronger, so he does not disappoint Master Ikithon again.</p><p>But\nnot quite yet. The others hold him between them, again an unspoken\nritual. They lean close; they both know that it helps him in moments\nlike this, to have the physicality and the grounding of it. They both\nunderstand, as if it\u2019s not him its one of them. \n</p><p>He\nis pressed between the two of them, and at long last, he begins to\nshake and sob, even though the pain is gone. Somehow, being so close\nto them allows him to let himself cry, and he does, dampening the\nshoulder of Astrid\u2019s shirt with his tears of pain and humiliation,\nas she holds him and Eodwulf strokes his hair. \n</p><p>They\nsit there until the sun goes down, and eventually, Caleb has calmed\ntoo, the pain replaced by weariness as he begins to doze, and finally\nthe tremble in his hands is stilled. \n</p><hr><p>Most\nof the time though, his private lessons do not end like this. If\nMaster Ikithon is happy with his work, then there will be a rare,\nbenevolent smile, a word of praise even. And there is something else\ntoo; a ritual, that comes at the end of the meeting. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon sits him down, and lays two gentle fingers on the side of\nCaleb\u2019s head, just at his temple, then briefly on the other side.\nIt feels almost like a blessing, a benediction. There is magic in\nthat touch, but it is so subtle that Caleb can barely detect it, let\nalone understand it. Not that he spends much time questioning it; the\ntruth that his master has his best interests at heart is one that he\nholds closer than any other, and Caleb trusts him implicitely.</p><p>\u201cVery\ngood, Caleb. You did well today.\u201d And then, the words with which\nhis master always ends their meetings: \u201cstay on this path and don\u2019t\nturn aside, and it will take you far.\u201d</p><hr><p>(There\nare things that don\u2019t match up, sometimes. Because he is very\nperceptive, Caleb notices them occasionally, just. Sometimes, it\u2019s\neveryday things; he will find himself more often in the situation\nwhere he walks through a door and forgets why. Other times, it\u2019s a\nlittle harder to dismiss; he will find himself at the end of a\ncorridor without remembering having walked there, or there will be a\nbloodstain on his cuff that is just a little bit too large to be from\na papercut, even if he remembered getting one.)</p><p>(If\nhe had asked Master Ikithon about these occurrances, they would have\nbeen waved away with a kind smile, advice to get a little more sleep\nat night if he finds himself forgetting things, so that he may\ncontinue to excel in his studies.)</p><p>(In\nthe event though, Caleb mentions nothing of these lapses; he doesn\u2019t\neven tell Astrid and Eodwulf, let alone his master. He wouldn\u2019t\nwant to be thought of as weak or falling behind after all, or worse,\nunworthy of his master\u2019s teaching.)</p><hr><p>Astrid\nhas been working on a particular spell; her hands are dusted black\nwith charcoal when she bursts out of her room to show Caleb and\nEodwulf, who are sitting back to back and studying by the fire. They\nboth look up when she enters the room, the scent of incense drifting\nafter her in a swirling cloud, a proud grin on her face. \n</p><p>On\none arm she wears one of the thick, slightly scorched and stained\nleather gloves that they wear sometimes for their alchemy lessons. \n</p><p>On\nher gloved hand stands a sparrow hawk, feathers a little ruffled but\neyes bright, immediately swivelling to catch the two of them in its\ngaze.</p><p>Eodwulf\u2019s\neyes widen. \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nmy own familiar!\u201d Astrid\u2019s eyes are shining with pride, bright as\nthe hawk\u2019s. \u201cHis name is Hieronymus.\u201d</p><p>Eodwulf\nraises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve really thought this through, haven\u2019t\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\nI love him already.\u201d</p><p>The\nbird caws, as though in agreement, and cocks his sleek feathered head\ntowards Astrid\u2019s. \n</p><p>Hieronymus\nbecomes a part of their lives, for a while. Astrid changes his form\noften; not long after she first summons him she gathers the\ncomponents she needs once again, and experiments with the form of a\nbearded dragon, then an adder. For a few months he is often found\ncurled around Astrid\u2019s arm or around her neck, gently scenting the\nair with his little forked tongue as she studies in the light of the\nlamp. Then he is a mouse, then a cat, a raven, and, for a few\nmemorable days, an octopus, living in the pond outside in the garden.\nAstrid loves Hieronymus, changing his form to indulge him, she\ndeclares. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nwatching them together, thinks that it helps Astrid, to have him\nthere. When he is in a form with fur, her fingers are always\nstroking, touching it. When he is a serpent, she winds her hand\naround his tail lazily as she thinks. \n</p><p>It\nhelps her though, and for that, Caleb is glad. \n</p><hr><p>Master\nIkithon is a good teacher, but a hard one, and as they have grown\nstronger he has only asked more of them; they are not children, not\nanymore, and they must learn mental fortitude. They must learn not to\nlet themselves be held hostage by their feelings, never to let pity\nget in the way of doing what must be done.</p><p>When\none of them fails, now the others suffer too. \n</p><p>When\none of them fails, they must test their mettle to prove to him that\nthey are still worthy of his training, he says, with logic that none\nof them can argue with. They must work through some of the more\nunpleasant but sadly necessary sides of keeping the Empire safe and\nfree of traitors. \n</p><p>They\nmust prove their faith by demonstrating their latest achievements on\nthe others. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis screaming, as Astrid\u2019s spell strikes him in the chest with a\ncrackling, paralysing ray of dark necrotic energy. He can feel it\ndraining his life force, setting his stomach to churning and cold\nsweat beading on his brow as his vision tunnels. He gasps, as nausea\nwashes over him and ugly black blemishes crawl their way up his arms.</p><p>He\nis on his hands and knees and he can see Astrid, through the hair\nthat has fallen over his eyes. She is standing with her hand\nextended, still channeling the last of the spell. Her teeth are\ngritted, her eyes fixed on him with that forced detachment that they\nall know. Some hair has come loose from her braid at the front, the\nsheen of sweat sticking it to her brow the only signal that betrays\nhow much effort it is taking her to maintain this, to watch Caleb\nwrithe on the floor and not turn aside. Master Ikithon stands behind\nher, Eodwulf on the other side, his hands clasped tight enough to\ndrain the blood from the knuckles as he watches. \n</p><p>Caleb\ndoes not look up, at either Astrid or Eodwulf. He knows from\nexperience that eye contact only makes the it harder for them. If he\nlooks up, it will go on longer, and he does not want them to suffer\nanymore. \n</p><p>It\nwas only a small mistake that she made; just a slight slip in one of\nher spells, but she had wasted a diamond with an ill-cast spell.\nMaster Ikithon is teaching her to be careful with components, a\nlesson that the three of them have never had any pressing need to\nlearn, though an important one. \n</p><p>She\nis being made an example of, and they all know it. Caleb kneels\nretching and convulsing on the floor and wishing he could take her\npain on himself, too. Eodwulf, his face bloodless and his eyes wide\nwith paralysed, forced stillness, is thinking the same, Caleb knows. \n</p><hr><p>\u201cNo,\nslower. You must <i>control</i> the flames, the heat. Keep the water\njust short of the boil for now.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\ngrits his teeth and nods at his teacher, laying his palm just shy of\nflat under the base of the copper tank. Heating slowly has never been his strong point, and Master Ikithon has a way of picking out the little\nimperfections in his casting technique, of making him practice them\nuntil they are no longer imperfections. \n</p><p>He\nallows a thin sheet of flame to coat his palm, heating the water from\nbeneath, and focuses on control. The goal of the exercise is to heat\nthe water as slowly as possible; it should take an hour at the very\nleast to bring it to the boil. \n</p><p>They\u2019ve\npracticed with wax, tar and oil before, which are more forgiving,\ntaking more heat before they are bubbling and frothing at the boil.\nWater requires a lighter touch, the greatest mastery of the flow of\nheat through his fingers. \n</p><p>Still,\nhis teacher said he was ready and Caleb is determined to prove him\nright.</p><hr><p>He\nmasters it, in the end. He shows Astrid and Eodwulf proudly, keeping\nAstrid\u2019s old copper tea-kettle hot for hours with the slow heat\nfrom his palm. The tea is far too strong and bitter by the end, but\nthe other two drink it, loyally and proudly, as the cold edges into\nthe room. It\u2019ll be the first frost of the year tonight, after all;\nfire and warmth and company are all comforting.</p><p>Caleb\nis still buoyed up by the excitement of learning a new spell late\ninto the night, and so it does not occur to him then that this is not\nthe only way that such a skill could be used. \n</p><hr><p>They\nare losing the Zemnian accents to their words, slowly. \n</p><p>At\nthe beginning, of course, they used to speak Zemnian amongst\nthemselves. Now, though, they speak Common increasingly; they\u2019ve\ngrown accustomed to it. Sometimes, one of them will forget a word \u2013\nAstrid snapping her fingers in frustration as she tries to think of\nit, or Eodwulf pulling a face, a self-deprecating laugh and and a\nquick mime, a gesture in the air. <i>You know&hellip;that thing</i>. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis not usually the one who forgets. But whenever it happens, it is an\nunspoken agreement that the others will hurry to supply the missing\nword. Especially if they are speaking to Master Ikithon. His\nimpression of them and their conduct matters, of course, above all\nothers. \n</p><p>(He\nnever quite ordered them not to use their mother tongue; not in so\nmany words. But, they all know, it wouldn\u2019t do for him to think\nthat any of them wants to exclude him, for then he might think that\nthey have something to hide; then he might think them ungrateful.)</p><p>(Besides,\nthey are growing more comfortable with Common, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s\ngood practice, they each think. Practice for those bright-shining\nfutures that are laid before their feet.)</p><p>Later\nthey learn other languages, too; they learn Sylvan, and Caleb loves\nthe way the syllables sound on his tongue. He\u2019s good at languages;\nhe seems to pick them up easier than the others, as he does most\nthings. They learn Celestial, and it\u2019s harder but more rewarding;\nthe grammar is strange to Caleb, all complex noun inflections like\nhe\u2019s never heard. He masters it too, in the end, spends nights\nreading ancient tomes just for the thrill of it, just because he can.\n\n</p><p>(He\nand Eodwulf and Astrid speak it sometimes to each other, taking a\nquiet thrill in speaking the language of the Gods. It feels right,\nsomehow. For are the three of them not bright with possibility? These\ngolden three can do anything they set their minds to, even scraping\nthe stars, with Master Ikithon to guide them there of course.)</p><hr><p>\u201cCaleb,\nEodwulf, look what I can do!\u201d \n</p><p>They\nboth rush over, to see what Astrid has done. They find her at the\ntable, and on the table are three small white objects. They are about\nto ask what they are, when Eodwulf draws in a breathy gasp; Caleb\nrecognises what is going on at the same moment.</p><p>They\nare three dead mice, fresh blood staining the fur around their noses\nand mouths. \n</p><p>Astrid\nraises a hand over the mice, and a moment later their bodies are\ntwitching grotesquely, a motion that is life-like, he supposes, but\nsomehow just a little bit off. A moment later, the twitching is\ngrowing stronger, and then the mice are moving, flipping upwards onto\nall fours and then each standing up on their hind legs in a way that\nis utterly different to any living mouse Caleb has ever seen.</p><p>Astrid\nwiggles her fingers, and the mice begin to dance. As they do she\nlooks up at the two of them proudly. Hieronymus is a snake again,\nand he curls over one of her shoulders, tongue lashing out hungrily.\nBut she pushes him back, staying fiercely focussed on the mice on the\ntable in front of her. They leave tiny, bloody smudges of footprints\non the wood of the tabletop.</p><p>It\nis a disturbing sight, but in that moment, Astrid looks so proud and\nhappy, the mere sight makes Caleb\u2019s heart sing. \n</p><hr><p>(There\nare no forbidden books in the library; what there are are books that\nhis mind slides away from, eyes that usually take in every detail\ngliding over their titles without taking them in. Luckily though,\nthese books are not on his reading lists, so it does not impact his\nstudies in any way.)</p><hr><p>Behind\nthe house there is a garden, and in the garden, there is a\nconservatory. The conservatory is bright and spacious, with wicker\nchairs and hanging baskets of flowers. \n</p><p>In\nthe corner of the conservatory, there is a plain wooden door that\nleads to the garden, and they have never seen it opened. Caleb,\nAstrid and Eodwulf don\u2019t think much of it, until they learn that it\ncannot be opened except with a key that Master Ikithon keeps on him\nat all times. \n</p><p>They\nhave been studying with him for about eight months when he first\ntakes them out to the conservatory and unlocks the door. Before they\ncan ask what he is doing, they see the door swing open for the first\ntime. Beyond it, where there should be the garden, there is a stone\nstaircase, a tight spiral lit by magical, ever-burning lamps, going\ndownwards.</p><p>They\nfollow Master Ikithon down the stairs. \n</p><p>The\nspiral goes on for a very long time, longer than Caleb expects;\nthough he\u2019s not quite sure if it really goes down so far or even\nhow much time has passed. There might well be some magic in it, a\nsubtle one he doesn\u2019t recognise yet. None of them talk on the way\ndown, they just keep following, the three students in a row behind\ntheir teacher.</p><p>Eventually,\nthe staircase ends. There is another locked door, there, and this one\ncertainly is magic; the doorjamb and the door itself seems to thrum\nwith it, though the spell is too powerful for him to have learned\nyet. He casts Detect Magic, discretely; he\u2019s in the habit of it, he\nlikes to know things even before Master Ikithon explains them. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb suspected, the door is radiating the bright glow of high-level\nconjuration magic. He looks over at Astrid, sees her frowning as she\nlays a tentative hand on the doorjamb. \n</p><p>Before\nany of them do anything else, though, their master turns to them. In\nthe glow of the magical lights, Master Ikithon\u2019s face is cast in\nstark light and shadow. \u201cOnce we cross this threshold, my bright\nones,\u201d he tells them, \u201cknow that there is a trust between us,\nabove and beyond what has been before.\u201d He raises a hand, smiling\nonce again that benevolent, almost fatherly smile, though it is\nsomewhat melancholic now. \u201cI know, I have already placed a great\ndeal of trust in you three. And I don\u2019t mean to stop now, but there\nare things that you will see and do that require&hellip;some extra\ncommitment, on your parts.\u201d He looks steadily at each of them, gaze\npiercing suddenly. Caleb stares determinedly back, holding the look\nuntil it moves on. \u201cCan I trust you to do what must be done for the\nEmpire, to never break under pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He\nnods, smiling once more, the sharpness in him gone almost as soon as\nit came. \u201cI knew I could.\u201d</p><p>And\nwith that, he opens the door for the first time. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb had suspected, the air smells different down here, and the\nchange in temperature and humidity is noticable; it confirms his\nsuspicion that the door is a portal of some kind, to somewhere other\nthan under their master\u2019s house. The corridor is not dark,\nprecisely, but it is dim, the magical lights lower here. They are in\na corridor with heavy steel vault doors in rows along each side. \n</p><p>The\ndoor vanishes behind them. Caleb cannot quite suppress a shiver, even\nthough it isn\u2019t cold.</p><p>\u201cWhere\nare we?\u201d asks Eodwulf. \n</p><p>\u201cWe\nare in Rexxentrum, far beneath the citadel and the castle keep.\u201d\nMaster Ikithon smiles, mildly. \u201cI am your teacher, and teaching\noccupies much of my time these days. But as you may know, I am\ninvolved, in the capacity of&hellip;ah, shall we say, more of a trusted\nconsultant now, in matters of intelligence, and specifically of\nquashing rebellion from within the Empire even before it takes root.\u201d\nHe clasps his hands, looks at the three of them standing before him.\n\u201cI am most pleased to inform you, my pupils, that you have come far\nenough that the council has allowed me to&hellip;enlist your help with\nthis, in certain ways.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf and Astrid exchange looks of excitement; they have heard\nmuch speculation about their master\u2019s role in the Empire, and\nrumours swirl of an exciting life in the keeping of secrets and\nspying, of daring missions to oust traitors. Could it possibly be\ntrue? And are they really being brought in on that noble task?</p><p>\u201cTo\nwit\u201d their teacher continues, continuing to walk them down the\nstone corridor with its ever burning lamps, \u201cI have decided that\nnow is the time to begin to train you in the art of negotiation. It\nwill serve you well, to be able to glean more information from a\nperson than you give away, and with the strength of your magic now,\nyou are well on your way to becoming just what the Empire needs to\nmaintain the peace.\u201d He stops in front of a great metal-bound door,\ncovered in heavy, complicated locks, both mechanical and glowing with\nthe arcane thrum of spells of locking and warding. He touches a spot\non the door and the locks begin to open one by one, the well-oiled\nslide of steel on steel making almost no noise. After a moment, the\ndoor behind him swings open, revealing another corridor lined with\nheavy locked doors. \n</p><p>Their\nmaster turns around to look at them, hands open towards them.\n\u201cTraitors all, in these cells\u201d he says. \u201cBound to be executed.\nBut it would be a waste to do so without finding out what secrets\nthey can tell us, that we can then use to make the Empire safer,\nwould it not?\u201d</p><p>The\nthree nod fervently; it makes sense, as does everything their teacher\nsays. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon gifts them a rare smile, turning to the corridor. He walks to\na door on the right, opening it to reveal a dwarven woman, dressed in\nrags, her face smeared with blood and grime. She is shackled hand and\nfoot, but it is her eyes that are truly frightening. They seem to\nburn with a cold hatred, an anger and resentment and defiance such as\nCaleb has never seen before. He exchanges looks with Astrid and\nEodwulf, knowing they are having the same thought: <i>this, then, is\nwhat a traitor looks like.</i></p><p>Master\nIkithon, however, seems unfazed, and spreads his hands out to them.\n\u201cThen let us begin our first lesson.\u201d And with that, he walks\ninto the cell. \n</p><p>He\ndoes not look to see if they are following after; he knows that they\nare. \n</p><hr><p>The\nsound of screams of pain, inflicted by their own hands, is already\none that is known to them. \n</p><p>It\nbecomes familiar, the more times they return to that dungeon under\nthe earth. It becomes commonplace, even, though when that happened\nnone of them can quite tell. \n</p><hr><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf are being punished, today. \n</p><p>Last\nnight they had fallen asleep over their written work together, heads\npillowed on each other\u2019s shoulders as they had studied for a test.\nAstrid had come back from a lesson to find them, and she had woken\nthem to keep studying \u2013 knowing, of course, exactly what they would\nwant her to do \u2013 but it had not been enough. They had taken the\ntest in the morning, and Eodwulf had failed. Caleb had scraped a\npassing grade, at least by Academy standards. But then, this is not\nthe academy; only the best is good enough. It is enough to distress\nCaleb terribly; usually, his grades are impeccable, but he has been\nputting in extra work lately, trying to add more and more time in the\ndungeons too. He needs to be stronger, he knows. Less forgiving, less\nmerciful. \n</p><p>Perhaps\nMaster Ikithon knows this, for this time, it is Caleb who is chosen\nto inflict the punishment. \n</p><p>He\nlooks into Eodwulf\u2019s eyes as he closes his fingers around his\nfriend\u2019s wrist, which is trembling very slightly. <i>Don\u2019t show\nfear!</i> Caleb wants to cry out, but he cannot, as his master stands\nbehind him. \n</p><p>Instead\nhe grits his teeth and holds on to Eodwulf\u2019s arm, ignites his palm\nand refuses to look away as his dear friend cries out for mercy. The\nsmell of burning skin \u2013 sickeningly familiar, now - begins to fill\nthe room, and Caleb is trembling, but his teacher\u2019s shadow is\nbehind him. A little way further back, he is distantly aware of the\nsound of Astrid\u2019s muffled sobs. \n</p><p>He\ntells himself that he and Eodwulf deserve this. He tells himself it\nwill be over quickly. Tears spill down his face, but he does not turn\nor look away.</p><p>It\nis over, in the end. Afterwards, when they have been judged to have\nlearned their lesson, Master Ikithon sends them away to the healing\npotion store with benevolent mercy.</p><p>They\nall sleep in Astrid\u2019s room that night, curled up on the bed\ntogether, crying until they all have no tears left. \n</p><p>At\nleast until the next time. \n</p><hr><p>They\nare given leave to return home to Blumenthal for visits,\noccasionally. They travel there for Harvest Close, or a little before\n\u2013 they all know that their parents need the extra pairs of hands to\nhelp with the harvest \u2013 or, sometimes, for Winter\u2019s Crest. \n</p><p>This\nis how it is the winter they are sixteen. \n</p><p>(This\nis not the last time they will return, nor the second last. But it is\nthe last that Caleb will be able to remember, from the distance of\nmany years and a broken second life, as truly happy.)</p><p>They\nare at Eodwulf\u2019s parents\u2019 house, and outside the window, snow is\nfalling gently. Their families are all there, as are some of the\nfamilies of the other children they knew, when they really were\nchildren; Caleb shares glances with Astrid and Eodwulf and knows that\nthey are thinking the same thing. How long it\u2019s been, how much\nthey\u2019ve grown beyond this place. The others that they left behind\nare living in a completely different world, and none of the three\nquite know how they should interact with this place they have left\nbehind. \n</p><p>It\u2019s\ncomforting, yes, in the way that home is, all soft colours and\nhalf-remembered voices. It smells like childhood. It\u2019s good to hear\nand speak Zemnian again, but if one more person informs Caleb he\u2019s\npicked up an accent, he mutters to the other two, he has half a mind\nto just up and leave.</p><p>He\ndoesn\u2019t leave, of course. He\u2019s finding himself too at ease for\nthat. The night carries on, as the snow falls softly outside. He\ndoesn\u2019t always feel at ease, talking to people \u2013 apart from his\nfamily, and Eodwulf and Astrid of course \u2013 but here, tonight, he\ndoes. He mingles around the room, but always he is watching them from\nthe corners of his eye. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nis spinning illusions for his little cousins, making even the adults\ngasp and praise his skill. The children are positively delighted,\ntheir small hands grabbing at a flight of miniature birds, seven baby\nrabbits hopping across the floor, a dancer in shimmering silks and\nsatins spinning in the centre of the floor to illusory music. Eodwulf\nstands in the centre of it, smiling in that shy way he has when\npeople compliment him, as though he doesn\u2019t know what to say. \n</p><p>Astrid\nstands a little way off, clapping and cheering for Eodwulf\u2019s\nillusions louder than any of the others. Her eyes catch Caleb\u2019s\nacross the room and she grins, beckoning him over to join in. \n</p><p>And\nof course, he goes.</p><p>Later\nin the evening, food is served \u2013 Eodwulf\u2019s family always makes\nthe best food, but everyone from the village has brought something to\nshare. There is hot, spiced wine, kept hot above a brazier in a brass\nbowl polished carefully to a mirror shine. Caleb knows what\u2019s\ncoming next; he remembers this from his childhood. He wasn\u2019t old\nenough then to be given more than a thimbleful, but he had loved to\nwatch anyway. He still does, smiling as Eodwulf\u2019s mother places a\nlittle wire shelf above the bowl, a loaf of solid sugar on top of it\nwhich she then soaks in rum. An anticipatory hush falls.</p><p>Then\nshe smiles, strikes a match, and sets it alight. \n</p><p>It\nburns orange for a moment, then bright blue, clear flames rippling\nalong the crystalline surface of the sugar. After a moment it begins\nto melt the sugar, dripping down into the wine. Magical fire is also\nblue sometimes, he finds himself thinking. It looks different though;\nit takes an expert to tell, but he knows fire, now. He knows how it\nbehaves, he knows how to create it and control it, the shapes it\nmakes and how it catches and spreads. \n</p><p>He\nrealises he is daydreaming as his mother touches his shoulder, and\nCaleb feels himself start, then smile, as Astrid elbows her way\nthrough the crowd of people filling the small sitting room, placing a\ncup in his hands. \n</p><p>He\nthanks her as he takes it, feeling the warmth glow against his hands.\nHe sips, enjoying the warmth and sweetness, the spirit already\nbeginning to heat his throat. \n</p><p>Astrid\nwanders off the other side of the room as the party resumes again,\nlouder now. But Caleb hangs back slightly. He is thinking about fire;\nit\u2019s true what his teacher says, he thinks, his mind a little warm\nand muzzy with the drink. It\u2019s true that fire can create new\nthings, as much as it can destroy. All this&hellip;whatever they do, in\nthat dungeon, it\u2019s all for the sake of the citizens of the Empire,\nfor people like these, leading safe lives like the ones the three of\nthem were raised to. It\u2019s all to protect them from the threat of\nchaos, of the dark that threatens to destroy them. \n</p><p>And\nin this moment it\u2019s absolutely worth it.</p><p>\u201cHaving\na good time, <i>Erdbeerchen</i>?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\nblinks, lifting his eyes from his cup at the sound of the childhood\nnickname; he\u2019s been gazing down into it for a few minutes now, he\nrealises, and not talking to anyone. <i>Right</i>; he remembers that\nwhen he does that, most people interpret it as him not having a good\ntime. \n</p><p>Not\nhis mother though; she knows him too well. She knows that he can\u2019t\nhandle large groups that well, though it\u2019s gotten a little easier\nsince he was a child. He looks up at her and smiles. \u201c<i>Ja,\nMutti</i>.\u201d</p><p>She\nruffles his hair, a scant shade darker red than he own. \u201cGood.\u201d\nShe raises an eyebrow asking for permission and he sighs, nods, lets\nher pull him in for a hug; suddenly he realises that in the time he\u2019s\nbeen away, he\u2019s grown as tall as she is. She pulls away, holding\nhim by the shoulders and inspecting him with an affectionate but\ncritical eye. He expects her to ask him if he\u2019s been using the\nsalve she gave him for his acne last time he was home, or tell him he\nlooks like he hasn\u2019t been sleeping enough, or some other such\nthing. But instead she grins, her eyes flicking off the the corner to\nwhere Astrid and Eodwulf are talking, their heads close together over\ntheir cups\nof wine. <br/></p><p>\n\u201cWhich\none of them is it that makes you look at them like that?\u201d his\nmother asks, and Caleb chokes a little, already feeling a blush rise. <br/></p><p>\u201cYou three are so inseparable these days, your father and I are\nhaving trouble telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\nno, it\u2019s not like that - \u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh.\u201d\nShe smiles, teasing. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be embarrassed. It\u2019s\nhow it is, at your age, and first love is an excitement\nthat-\u201d\n</p><p>\u201c<i>Mutti</i>&hellip;\nno, I mean I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say&hellip;ah&hellip;l-love\u2026\u201d\nthe word burns with possibility in his mouth, but more than that; it\nfeels strange and ill-fitting for what is between them, even\nreductive. It is a given, isn\u2019t it, that he loves Eodwulf and\nAstrid? They spend each day together, bound by their destiny, sharing\neverything. But he doesn\u2019t think that is the kind of love she\nmeans. He stares determinedly down into his cup, a grown-out lock of\nhair falling over his face. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cCaleb.\n<i>Mein liebling</i>. Look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\nflounders, as she leans forward and tucks the hair behind his ear. It\nis an affectionate gesture, but one that also means he has to meet\nher eye. She is merely looking at him with raised eyebrows. \u201cOnly\nyou can say what you really feel. And that means taking a good hard\nlook at what\u2019s in your heart, and not turning away from it.\u201d She\nsmiles. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen the way you\u2019ve been looking all evening,\nso I think you know already, somewhere in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\nsighs, looking back over at Astrid and Eodwulf. Astrid is telling a\nstory, gesturing with her free hand in the air, the firelight dancing\noff her glasses and golden waves of hair that is loose over her\nshoulder for once, unbraided and catching the light in burnished\ngold. Eodwulf is laughing at what she was saying, his cheeks dimpling\nas he smiles. He takes a sip of wine and the apple of his throat bobs\nup and down.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ntakes a drink too, sure his face is on fire now. He turns back to his\nmother, who is stifling laughter. \u201cSorry\u201d she says. \u201cYou&hellip;you\ndon\u2019t have to tell me, you know. Not if you don\u2019t want to. Just\nas long as you are being careful and safe&hellip;\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>M</i><i>utt</i><i>er!</i>\u201d\nhe blurts out, wishing he could sink into the floor, as she pats him\nconsolingly on the arm. He sighs, looking down. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\nboth of them, a bit. But it\u2019s not like that, with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\nnarrows her eyes for a second, and he knows she is reading him,\nseeing that what he says is the truth. She always had placed her\ntrust in him, even as a child. She hums sympathetically, dropping her\nvoice a little for the words she says next. \u201cBut I think\u2026you want\nit to be&hellip;or am I wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\ngrimaces, still half wishing to sink through the floor, but also,\nsurprisingly, finding himself glad to have someone to speak about\nthis with. \u201c\u2026Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm\u2026\nthat\u2019s a difficult problem. Have you tried&hellip;saying anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>His\neyes widen, slightly appalled. \u201cOh, no! I couldn\u2019t possibly&hellip;\u201d\nhe tails off, at her expression. He hesitates, face burning. \u201c<i>Mutti</i>,\njust&hellip;say that there was something&hellip;\u201d he ignores her triumphant\nsmile, resolute. \u201cSay that there was something&hellip;that I wanted to\nsay to someone.\u201d His face burns hotter than fire. \u201cHow would I\neven&hellip;\u201d he gestures wildly. \n</p>\n<p>Her\ngentle smile makes him pause, as she takes his hand in hers. \u201cJust\nsay it. I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s no other way.\u201d She sends a look\nover to where the other two stand, still talking in low voices. \u201cBut\nyou know\u2026 I think you\u2019re lucky to have them, and they to have\nyou. You three&hellip;\u201d she shook her head, \u201cyou three have a magic\nbetween you, that\u2019s not just the kind you learn in your classes.\nYou\u2019ve always been better together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsmiles to himself, as she ran her thumb over the back of his hand. \u201cI\nknow, <i>Mutti</i>. And\u2026 thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\nhugs him again, and he lets himself smile wider as her hair tickles\nhis face. \u201cAny time, <i>Kr</i><i>\u00fc</i><i>melchen</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Mutt</i><i>er</i>&hellip;\nplease <i>s</i>top\nit&hellip; I\u2019m not a baby anymore&hellip;\u201d</p>\n<p>Her\nlaughter is as warm as he always remembered it, mingling with the\ncontented chatter and quiet music of the room. She touches his cheek,\nlooking into his eyes with a proud smile, that is also slightly\nmelancholic; she misses the days of his childhood when he was at home\nwith her, he realises then. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry\u201d she says, cupping his cheek. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><hr><p>He\nthinks about what she\u2019s said with a slightly clearer head on the\njourney back, as the carriage jostles him back and forth. The three\nare bundled up in warm knitted clothes for the journey, and Caleb is\nbeginning to feel very warm. It\u2019s not the many layers though; it\u2019s\nbecause he is sitting squeezed in between the two of them in two\nseats. The other seats are occupied by a large basket of freshly\nbaked bread, almond crescent cookies and gingerbread stars and cakes\nfilled with sweet plum jam. Gifts from their parents, as well as new\nknitted clothes to keep them warm in the winter, and a new fur-lined\ncloak each \u2013 these they are actually wearing, as it\u2019s cold on the\njourney. There is also a wheel of cheese of the kind they remember\nfrom their childhoods in the village, a small cask containing ale,\nmade by Caleb\u2019s father\u2019s cousin, who is the village brewer.\nSeveral clumsy wooden toys whittled by the younger children, just\nlearning their craft. A beautifully embroidered quilt from Eodwulf\u2019s\ngrandmother. A wood flute like Astrid\u2019s uncle used to play on\nsummer nights under the moon. \n</p>\n<p>Simple\ngifts, but they are glad of them. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nand Eodwulf are leaning against both of his shoulders and dozing as\nthey journey back to their master\u2019s house. Astrid\u2019s hair tickles\nhis nose, and Eodwulf\u2019s wool-gloved hand has come to rest on the\nseat, just touching Caleb\u2019s knee.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\nnot new, of course. Or at least, not the closeness of them. Caleb and\nAstrid and Eodwulf have long passed the point in their friendship at\nwhich falling asleep curled together on the soft chairs in their\nlittle common room is ordinary. It is a source of comfort. When their\nmaster punishes them, or on nights when the nightmares come for one\nor the other of them, they will sometimes wordlessly slip into each\nother\u2019s rooms, not even needing to speak as they curl up together.\nThey\u2019re all used to closeness, to the gentle rhythm of each other\u2019s\nsleep breathing, the warm weight of each other pressed close. Them\nagainst the world. They understand this. \n</p>\n<p>Always\nbefore though, Caleb has imagined that this is what having siblings\nis like, but now, suddenly, it feels unimaginably different from\nthat. But to say that his mother\u2019s half-teasing, half insistent\nenquiring, has set him to rethinking that is a vast understatement;\nit has set off a firestorm inside his head, full of dangerous\npossibilities. Making his face heat even to contemplate, but somehow\nimpossible to look away from. \n</p>\n<p>And\ndoesn\u2019t he of all people know the possibilities of fire, doesn\u2019t\nhe know the way it spreads if left to itself?</p>\n<p>Astrid\u2019s\nhead nods against his chest, over his heart, and Caleb feels fire run\nup and down his whole body.</p>\n<p>Resignedly,\nhe raises the fur-lined travel blanket up to tuck around Astrid more\nfully, then hesitates for a moment, then lays his own head down on\ntop of Eodwulf\u2019s, pointedly resisting the sudden and urge to drop a\nkiss right in the center of his hair, where it parts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Verdammt!</i>\u201d\nCaleb mutters to himself, as he closes his eyes in resignation.</p>\n<hr><p>It\nis Eodwulf he kisses first, in the dim light of the lamp one night\nwhen Astrid is at a lesson. It is some months after the conversation with his mother, and he knows the others feel it too, now; the signs are there, or maybe they were all along, if only he had been looking. <br/></p><p>It was only a matter of time.<br/></p><p>They are sitting together by the fire,\nand silence has fallen; the kind of companionable silence that exists\nwhen people know each other so well that they understand each other\nperfectly without the need for words. Behind them, the fire is a dim\nred glow, and Caleb can see it reflected and dancing in miniature, in\nEodwulf\u2019s dark eyes, turned to molten amber in the firelight that\ncatches there. He feels something hitch in his chest, as they each\nlean forward, warm breath mingling between them as their lips meet.</p>\n<p>They\nare there for some time, kissing in the quiet.</p>\n<p>In\nfact, it is more time than Caleb thinks. Usually, he is able to know\nwhat time it is with perfect accuracy. But time, it seems, is\ndifferent in this situation \u2013 a fact he files away for future\nreference - because Astrid is back from her lesson. \n</p>\n<p>She\nknows immediately. Caleb sees it in her eyes, the small tug of a\nsmile at the corner of her mouth. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\npulls away quicker than Caleb, his face endearingly alarmed. He\ndoesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings. \u201cAstrid! We were just&hellip;\u201d he\ntails off vaguely, darting a glance at Caleb. \n</p>\n<p>He\ncan\u2019t help it; he immediately starts laughing, buoyed up by the\ntouch of Eodwulf\u2019s lips he can still feel against his. Astrid\nstarts laughing too, her face splitting into a mischievous grin.\n\u201cWell\u201d she says, \u201cI knew it was going to happen at some point.\u201d\nShe takes Caleb\u2019s hand, then Eodwulf\u2019s, looking endearingly\nvulnerable for a moment. As though asking for permission. Caleb takes\nher hand, holds it fiercely, tightly close, and she smiles again,\ncarrying on. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry you had to start without me.\u201d</p>\n<hr><p>Time\npasses, as time does.</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Master Ikithon are in the dungeons again, down the spiral from\nthe conservatory and into what sometimes seems like another world, in\ncontrast to the bright garden from which they enter that place. It is\neasier, Caleb has found, to think of it so; to separate these trips\nfrom the rest of his life. Some part of him, then, can pretend that\nthe work they do here is not real, that it is not a real person who\nscreams under his touch. \n</p>\n<p>The\nman \u2013 the traitor \u2013 is naked and submerged in water up to his\nneck, a large copper vessel almost like a bathtub. The metal conducts\nheat well; this Caleb knows from his lessons in alchemy. Chains run\nfrom his ankles, wrists and throat to heavy iron brackets on the\nwalls. \n</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon nods at him, and Caleb lays a hand against the copper\nexterior of the bath. \n</p>\n<p>He\nhas long since mastered the technique of heating water with\nexcruciating slowness, but they have been down here for some time\nnow; clouds of steam are beginning to roll off the top of the water,\nrising into the air which is growing hot and humid, though they are\ndeep in the dungeons. Caleb\u2019s face is shiny and dripping with sweat\nfrom the heat, but his hands do not shake as he lays them against the\nmetal. \n</p>\n<p>His\nteacher is watching him, after all. \n</p>\n<p>The\nheat rises, and the man in the bathtub begins to scream. All the\nwhile, Master Ikithon stands behind him with his hands clasped neatly\nbehind his back, asking questions in a voice with no inflection. He\nis thorough; he teases out information, getting into every corner and\nleaving nothing that could be of significance. \n</p>\n<p><i>Who\nwas your leader? When and where did the group meet? Did any of the\nothers get away? What were the plans if it went wrong? Where was your\nhideout? Do any of the other conspirators have families in the city?</i>\nAnd on and on. Caleb is expected to remember this, to take careful\nmental notes. Sometimes, after all, it is him doing the questioning.</p>\n<p>They\nall resist, at first; Caleb has come to know this. They all put up a\nshow of sticking to their treasonous principles. But when they are in\npain, when their minds are cooking within their flesh, then the truth\nspills. It takes control and attention to catch it as it does,\nthrough a semi-conscious haze and screams of agony, but Caleb is\nlearning. \n</p>\n<p>All\nfor the good of the empire, Caleb thinks, feeling a rush of\nsatisfaction as Master Ikithon nods to him approvingly, as he turns\nthe heat in the water up a little more. He is becoming good at\ntelling when they have no more to give, when the end must come. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare not unmerciful, after all. They are not cruel, they only seek the\ntruth, and once it has gone these traitors are mere husks, empty and\nworthless. Yet they still must be punished. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nraises the temperature of the water to boiling, the hiss mingling\nwith the man\u2019s final, exhausted scream. \n</p>\n<hr><p>The\nfollowing summer, Eodwulf almost breaks. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nnever finds out exactly what happened. He and Astrid spend a brief\ntime speculating, but neither quite have the words to speak about it.\n\n</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s\nwhat they know; they know that Eodwulf is growing strong in his\nmagic. They know that Master Ikithon is teaching him to pry open\nminds, to spin illusions to strike fear and then pick their heads\nlike locks and break inside, to better let them spill their secrets\nto him. For the sake of the Empire, of course. Some traitors have\nmuch more to yield if given this treatment. It depends on the person,\nas their teacher says. Everyone has their own way in which they\nbreak. \n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\ndangerous, Caleb knows; such things are not his main area of study,\nbut he knows that Eodwulf has had trouble in the past with not\nletting them into his own mind. From what he knows, for that sort of\nmagic one\u2019s own empathy needs to be both sharpened and blunted all\nat once. This is to allow the connection and the mastery over the\ntarget to be strong and pervasive enough to do what must be done,\nwhile protecting one\u2019s own mind from the strain, or from\nretaliatory attacks. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and a fine line to\nwalk. \n</p>\n<p>They\ndo not know exactly what Eodwulf learns in his private lessons with\ntheir teacher, in the dungeons under the conservatory; it feels\nsafer, somehow, not to know.</p>\n<p>One\ngolden summer day, Caleb and Astrid are sitting in the garden\nreading. Or rather, Caleb is reading, and Astrid has set down her\nbook, is lying down in the grass across Caleb\u2019s lap and idly\nlevitating his wide-brimmed straw hat in the air above his head. It\u2019s\nstill a good sunshade; she keeps it expertly in place, shading his\nface and eyes so that his paler skin does not burn in the noonday\nsun. It\u2019s a companionable silence between them.</p>\n<p>The\nsilence is broken by the slamming open of the door to the\nconservatory, and Caleb frowns, closing his book as Eodwulf appears\nat the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstrid&hellip;\u201d</p>\n<p>She\ndrops the spell, and the hat flops neatly back down over Caleb\u2019s\nhead. He pulls up the brim to exchange a look as she sits up, looking\nover to where Eodwulf is running across the garden back to the house.</p>\n<p>There\nis something in the way he is running; desperation, fear. \n</p>\n<p>They\ncan\u2019t see his face from this distance. But it looks almost as\nthough he\u2019s running away from something. \n</p>\n<hr><p>There\nis punishment, for running away from one\u2019s duties. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nis sitting on the ground, crying soundless tears and biting down hard\nenough on her lip to draw blood. Her glasses are cracked and her eyes\nare blank and staring into nothingness as Eodwulf stands in front of\nher, a trembling hand extended. Master Ikithon\u2019s hand is on his\nshoulder, his face grave. Illusion magic swirls about him, as Eodwulf\nchannels the spell that is making Astrid see horrors dance before her\neyes. Caleb feels a rush of sympathy for them both. The last time\nEodwulf made a mistake, it was Caleb who had to be the subject of his\ncorrective practice. Afterwards, Eodwulf had come to him gushing\napologies, curling up in Caleb\u2019s lap and sobbing. All Caleb had\nbeen able to do was hold him, stroking his hair and telling him that\nreally, he had been all right.</p>\n<p>(He\nhadn\u2019t been all right, actually; he had seen a detailed illusory\nimage of a dragon devouring his family, ripping them limb from limb\nwhile he was held in place and unable to go to them, and it still\nweighed on his mind, though he knew it was not real.)</p>\n<p>Eventually,\nAstrid had joined them, letting a weasel-formed Hieronymus curl\nsinuously around Eodwulf\u2019s neck as he sobbed into Caleb\u2019s\nshoulder. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, it would be different, Caleb knows. The look in Eodwulf\u2019s\neyes is different; something has tipped like a scale inside him. \n</p>\n<p>Suddenly,\nEodwulf is lowering his hand, the magic dissipating like smoke as\nAstrid slumps sideways. Caleb doesn\u2019t even know if she\u2019s\nconscious, and he wants nothing more than to run to her side. But in\nthat moment, he dare not. His eyes are fixed on Eodwulf, who had\nstopped casting his spell, in defiance of Master Ikithon\u2019s orders. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u201d\nEodwulf whispers, almost a question. As though he cannot believe the\nchoice he just made. His eyes are filled with tortured defiance,\ndarting toward their master, then looking back at the ground as\nthough he cannot look anymore. \u201cNo\u201d he says again, eyes filling\nwith tears as he falls to his knees. \u201cNo, no no no&hellip;\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nis about to reach out to him \u2013 though the look in their master\u2019s\neyes is one of disappointment, and reaching out to Eodwulf suddenly,\nin this moment, feels dangerous, as though fear and weakness is a\ndisease that is contagious \u2013 but before he can, Eodwulf turns, with\none last look at Master Ikithon, and runs from the room. \n</p>\n<p>Their\nmaster does no follow him, merely sighs, deep and disappointed. He\nshakes his head in sorrow, looking over at Astrid \u2013 beginning to\nlever herself up off the floor, wiping her tear-stained face roughly\nwith her sleeve \u2013 and Caleb, shuffling over to be at least by her\nside. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cClass\ndismissed,\u201d says their master, his voice heavy with regret, and\nsweeps from the room, leaving behind a sense that whatever had\nhappened here today is not over.  \n</p>\n<hr><p>When\nCaleb and Astrid return to their little common room, Eodwulf is not\nthere. They knock on his bedroom door. He has barricaded it shut \u2013\nwith a chair under the handle rather than magic - and only relents\nwhen they threaten to blast it open. At this he opens the door only a\ncrack, one dark eye appears in the gap and looking at the two of\nthem, reproachful. \u201c<i>Was?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Astrid\nplaces her hands on her hips, standing square in the doorway. She\nanswers deliberately in Common, voice accustory.  \u201cWhy did you\nstop?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nopens the door a little more, and Caleb can see the droop of his\nshoulders. \u201cBecause&hellip;because I was hurting you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Idiot</i><i>!</i>\u201d\nshe snaps. Anyone else might think that she is angry, but Caleb knows\nthe truth. It is always fear that makes Astrid sharp as glass. Fear\nfor Eodwulf though; it\u2019s always for one of the two of them, never\nfor herself. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d she gestures with a\nhand in the air, agitated. \u201cYou can\u2019t just&hellip;<i>not</i> do it!\nYou can\u2019t refuse him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nhangs his head, looking away from her sullenly, not defending\nhimself. \n</p>\n<p>This\nonly seems to make things worse. In her anger, she summons\nHieronymus with a click of her fingers. He appears around her throat\nin the form of a snake, hissing along with her words. \u201cIf you&hellip;if\nyou can\u2019t do something so simple, to someone you&hellip;\u201d Astrid\nbreaks off, biting her lip. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have the strength it\ntakes. It\u2019s fucking <i>selfish</i> to stop because of me, when you\n<i>know</i> I\u2019m stronger than that!\u201d She\u2019s glaring at him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d She takes a deep breath, looking\nat Caleb for support. He lays a slightly trembling hand on her arm.\n\u201cAnd we can get through it together, and at the end we\u2019ll all be\ndefending the Empire together. But&hellip;\u201d her fingers clench in the\nsleeve of her shirt, ruching the fabric. \u201cBut we can\u2019t just stop\nnow. We\u2019ve come too far. We have to keep going! <i>Stay on this\npath and don\u2019t turn aside</i>&hellip;remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy\nfor you to say\u201d counters Eodwulf, voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\nI\u2019m not strong like you. And I\u2019m not smart like Caleb&hellip;\u201d he\nsighs, running fingers through his hair, stopping Caleb\u2019s protest\nwith a raised hand. \u201cI\u2026 sometimes\u2026\u201d he meets Astrid\u2019s\nglare, desperate, eyes filled with panic suddenly. \u201cSometimes, I\ndon\u2019t know if I can do this, <i>mein</i><i>e</i><i> S</i><i style=\"background-color: transparent;\">onnenblume</i>&hellip;\u201d\nEodwulf looks to Caleb for help as Astrid winces, crossing her arms\nover her chest and turning away. \n</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Nein!</i>\nStop it! You <i>don\u2019t</i> get to say you can\u2019t do it. Not now,\nnot ever!\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, squeezing Astrid\u2019s arm in a wordless gesture of comfort,\nmeeting Eodwulf\u2019s eyes at the same time. He reaches out to take his\nhand, but Eodwulf twitches away, so Caleb drops his hand awkwardly at\nhis side. \u201cShe\u2019s right, though. If Master Ikithon sent you away\nfrom here&hellip;\u201d he lets the sentence hang in the air, as they all\nimagine it. It was always supposed to be the three of them, after\nall; they wouldn\u2019t know what to do, how to be, with just two. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nsighs. \u201cHe&hellip;he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d But Caleb can hear the uncertainty\nin his voice. Eodwulf wrings his hands, looking between the two of\nthem. He seems to only half be looking at their faces. \u201cNot for\nthis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, stepping up and putting an arm around Astrid, whose hands are\nballed in fists at her sides, her shoulders tense. \u201cEodwulf - \u201d</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can say more, there\u2019s a knock at the door. They all\nstart; it is a vanishingly rare occurrence that their teacher should\ncome to visit them after hours, unless in the case of a momentous\nastronomical even that he would have them witness. Yet still, they\nall know the sound of his knock, even the sound of his footsteps in\nthe hall. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, Eodwulf flinches violently at the sound, begins scrubbing at\nhis teary eyes with a sleeve with desperate haste.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ngets up to open it. Their teacher is there, but he doesn\u2019t look\nangry. He almost never does \u2013 only disappointed. Now, though, he\nseems to have easily slipped back into the mild-mannered, slightly\nindulgent smile, though it is a little aggrieved looking. \n</p>\n<p>He\nregrets having to punish them; he always tells them so. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\nCaleb. May I see Eodwulf, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nblinks a little, nodding quickly, and already Eodwulf is there beside\nhim, and only Caleb is close enough to see the stiffness in his\nmuscles, fear and panic written in every line of his body. \n</p>\n<hr><p>The\nnext day Caleb stands in resolute stillness beside Astrid, both\ndrawing as much comfort as they can afford to allow themselves from\nthe closeness between them. It is just the two of them, and the\nsilence hangs over the whole house, heavy and oppressive. Neither of\nthem can concentrate on any work. \n</p>\n<p>He\nknows, at least, what Astrid is thinking, as she lets Hieronymus\ntwine about her fingers, quickly enough to indicate that she is\nnervous. She could send him to spy, but she does not, and Caleb\ndoesn\u2019t ask her to. \n</p>\n<p>He\nunderstands, because he is thinking the same thing, as they watch the\ndoor to their little sitting room, cautious glances cast from beneath\ntheir lashes. They are waiting for it to open, yet it does not, all\nday.</p>\n<p><i>That\nwill never be me</i>, Caleb thinks. <i>I will become stronger, so\nthat I never have to displease Master Ikithon so. I will not break,\nnot for anything. I must be made of steel and stone.</i></p>\n<p>At\nnight, Caleb and Astrid cling together in Astrid\u2019s bed, without any\nwords. No words are necessary; only the comfort that they can give\neach other, just by being close. They curl up together, and Caleb\nfalls asleep with his face pressed into the hollow of Astrid\u2019s\nthroat, her chin resting on the crown of his head.</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nis back the next day, quieter than usual but otherwise the same.</p>\n<p>Or\nnot quite the same; they do not speak of it, but there is something\ndifferent about him. Caleb can\u2019t quite place it at first, until he\ncan; the look in Eodwulf\u2019s eyes is different, after whatever\npunishment Master Ikithon dealt out. Eodwulf looks far away, his eyes\nnot quite making contact as they used to. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nnotices it immediately too. The two of them do not speak about their\nargument the day before; somehow, such a discussion seems reduntant,\nnow. \n</p>\n<p>And\nEodwulf is different in other ways, after that. More withdrawn,\nslower to show his emotions and slower to cry, either with joy or\nsorrow. They\u2019ve all changed, over the years, but this is the time\nthat Caleb and Astrid see it most clearly. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare happy for him, they tell themselves. Eodwulf is stronger now, and\nhe will not make the same mistake again. This, they can see in his\neyes more than anything, eyes that tell a little less now. Eyes that\nare a little darker, a little blanker, but not so quick to betray\nhim. More driven and hungry, more steel behind the softness.</p>\n<p>Caleb\u2019s\nmind slips away from the shadows under those eyes, slightly deeper\nthan before. He\u2019s almost jealous. Eodwulf also seems to have mended\nfences with Master Ikithon; though of course, their teacher was\nalways the sort who would forgive them in the end. They are his\nshining stars, after all, the bright future of the Empire.</p>\n<p><i>Just\nas long as they stay on the path, and do not turn aside.</i></p>\n<hr><p>Eodwulf\ncuts his hair short, that year. It has always been long, not as long\nas Astrid\u2019s golden braid \u2013 which she has taken to looping around\nher head and pinning into a neat little crown with pins that seem to\nturn up everywhere, even amongst Caleb\u2019s spell components and\nwriting materials \u2013 but long enough to hang in soft, inky ringlets\nto about his shoulders. With short hair, Eodwulf looks so different\nthat for a brief moment Caleb doesn\u2019t recognise him. But then there\nis Astrid\u2019s gasp, running over to Eodwulf and immediately carding\nher fingers through his short hair, and Caleb is smiling too, telling\nhim that it looks better now. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn\u2019t know if he actually thinks that; it makes Eodwulf look\nolder, and certainly more attractive. You can see his face fully now,\nwhereas before his eyes would often be half-covered by a fall of\nhair. And the part of Caleb that makes his heart flutter whenever he\nwatches Eodwulf\u2019s hands at work, that melts into his arms when\ntheir lips meet in a passionate kiss&hellip;that part of him is all for\nit. But there\u2019s another part, a part that loved the feeling of\nrunning his fingers through thick dark locks, a part that remembered\nhow much a younger Eodwulf had taken pride in his long hair, and\nwondered if the loss of the sweet and shy child who had been one of\nhis two best friends long before they had ever become lovers was\nworth the price. It\u2019s not just hair, after all; something else has\nchanged, something that goes bone-deep. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn\u2019t say this though; instead he promises to lend Eodwulf the\nhair pomade that his father gave him, the very moment he learned that\nCaleb would be mixing with the nobles in the city. The smell reminds\nCaleb powerfully of his childhood; his father would comb the stuff\nthrough Caleb\u2019s hair to tame his wild ginger mop, for special\noccasions; births, marriages, funerals, festivals of all sorts. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\naccepts it with a smile and a nod, but his eyes betray nothing. \n</p>\n<hr><p>They\nhave certain unspoken agreements, the three of them; truths that they\nnever quite decided outright, boundaries that they do not cross,\nwithout being quite able to say why. \n</p>\n<p>One\nof these is that they rarely speak to each other of what goes on in\ntheir private lessons with their master. For rhe ones that take place\nin the dungeons below the conservatory, this goes double. And those\nlessons are becoming more and more frequent; Master Ikithon must know\nthat they all have the strength to be able to do what must be done,\nthinks Caleb with a slight glow of pride.</p>\n<p>Today\nis one of the exceptions, and Astrid is the reason for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\nso, once I had asked that question, Master Ikithon seemed terribly\npleased that I\u2019d apparently hit the nail on the head of a whole\narea of scholarship&hellip;did you know that there are many philosophers\nof magic over the years who have done experiments on whether the\nundead can feel pain?\u201d Astrid is prestidigitating the blood and\nviscera off her over-tunic, as the others watch. One spell isn\u2019t\nenough to get it clean, so she\u2019s doing it repeatedly, telling Caleb\nand Eodwulf about her most recent lesson as she works. \u201cAnd he\nseemed excited that my questions had gone to that place - \u201d she\nsmiles proudly \u201c - and loaned me several books&hellip;\u201d she waves a\nbloody hand over at the large stack of books on the floor beside her.\n\n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf exchange a look of recognition, and pride; they\nunderstand why Astrid is so animated, after all. They all live for\nthe feeling of their teacher telling them that their thinking on a\nparticular topic is sound. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\nI take it it became a practical lesson?\u201d Caleb asks, raising an\neyebrow. When one of them begins a philosophical discussion, their\nmaster is always the first to encourage them to test their findings,\nand learn more.</p>\n<p>Astrid\nfreezes, then nods slowly. \u201cIt did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nand Caleb exchange another look. \u201c&hellip;And?\u201d</p>\n<p>Astrid\nswallows, pressing her lips together for a moment, before looking up\nat them. \u201cAll experiments show that the undead do feel pain. The\nmanner and degree seems to depend very much on how recently death\noccurred, type of undead, the level of the spell used to resurrect\nthem, the strength and character of the mage who casts it. But&hellip;yes\u201d\nshe says. She hesitates a little longer. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s the\nproblem that if they die, the information we want dies with them\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf nod. They\u2019ve experienced this before; their master is\nalways most displeased when they kill a traitor too early, before all\nthe information they contain has been wrung from them. It\u2019s a\ndelicate process. \n</p>\n<p>\u201c&hellip;But\ntheoretically at least, one could bring them back an unlimited number\nof times. Now, getting information out is not a trivial problem\neither, as resurrection does not always leave the mind and memories\nintact&hellip;\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u201d\nsays Caleb, nodding. \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\nit\u2019s something that Master Ikithon said is an area ripe for future\nexperimentation. Maybe if we collect enough data, I will even be\nallowed to make a presentation of my findings before the next sitting\nof the Cerberus Assembly!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAstrid,\nthat is wonderful.\u201d Eodwulf raises an eyebrow, eyes fixed on her\nface. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\ncongratulations!\u201d Caleb grins, then falters, when he sees Eodwulf\nlooking at Astrid strangely.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre&hellip;are\nyou all right?\u201d he asks; it is true, she is not looking quite as\nhappy about about the prospect as perhaps she should be. \n</p>\n<p>He\nwonders what is going through her mind, but restrains himself from\ncasting a simple Detect Thoughts to try to find out. He thinks he can\nguess some of it, anyway.</p>\n<p>She\nlooks up at him, and Caleb sees something run between the two of\nthem, some calculation that he is not quite a party too, but thinks\nhe understands at least partially too. \u201cYes\u201d Astrid says, going\nback to her bloody tunic, with a determined smile. \u201cYes, I am\nfine.\u201d</p>\n<hr><p>Master\nIkithon brings them to Rexxentrum with him, sometimes. Truly to the\ncity in a beautiful coach with horses, rather than just through the\nportal to the dungeons. \n</p>\n<p>(That\nis, after all, a different world.) \n</p>\n<p>He\nwants to show them off, this best and brightest, and the knowledge\nmakes Caleb\u2019s heart flutter with troublesome nerves. Caleb squashes\nthem resolutely; this is too important to allow his fear to get in\nthe way.</p>\n<p>Getting\ndressed for the occasion helps. They wear stiff formal uniforms for\nofficial visits, imperial black and gold with red trim, buttoned up\nto the neck and tied with heavy and complex sashes and pinned with a\nbeautiful golden brooch that is probably worth more than several\nyears\u2019 worth of his parents\u2019 wages on its own, he thinks. Things\nlike this occur to him sometimes; it\u2019s always a strangely\ndisorientating moment, when they do. \n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\nall right, though; when he\u2019s a real mage working for the Empire,\nwith a position of his own, then he\u2019ll be able to send them all the\nmoney they could ever want. \n</p>\n<p>He\nlikes that thought.</p>\n<hr><p>They\ndance, sometimes. Caleb is not good at it \u2013 easily the worst of the\nthree \u2013 but he is getting better. Astrid is a good dancer; she has\nloved it since she was a child, twirling in a yellow dress at Harvest\nClose in Blumenthal. But now she has learned refinement, quickly\npicking up the steps to dances that the nobles of Rexxentrum favour. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nwas always timid, before, but he is learning to dance too. Since the\ntime he almost broke, he has been less afraid, less conflicted. More\npoised, appearing older even though he is the youngest of the three. \n</p>\n<p>Now,\nEodwulf and Caleb sit on the side of the hall, sipping a fizzy, astringent green drink from crystal flutes. They watch Astrid polka\nacross the floor with a beautiful orange tiefling arcanist dressed\nall in flowing white silks. \n</p>\n<p>The\ntwo dance together after a little while, spinning slowly across the\nfloor. Then Caleb dances with Astrid, a little pink-cheeked from the\ndrink and from dancing every dance. She bows to him with an\nexaggerated flourish before going over to Eodwulf and taking his hand\nin hers. \n</p>\n<p>All\nthis makes Caleb feel almost strong enough to socialise a little, as\nthey are supposed to. He knows that the author of a treatise on\nmagical metallurgy and mining techniques that he found so fascinating\nlast year is here, and Caleb has been working up courage to go and\nspeak to him all evening. \n</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can do so, Master Ikithon catches his arm. He looks up,\nsurprised; his master has been deep in conversation with Oremid Hass,\nas well as several other dignitaries whose names Caleb doesn\u2019t\nknow, their faces graver than usual. Something is preparing, maybe.\nAnd so, he is grateful and proud that his master has a moment to\nspare for him.</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon comes close, conspiratorial. \u201cAh, Caleb. Enjoying the\nevening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\nvery much.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\ngives Caleb a long, calculating look, then nods, patting him on the\nshoulder approvingly, steering him towards the group of dignitaries\nin the corner. \u201cGood. Now, go and do what you\u2019re here for&hellip;you\nwon\u2019t be a student forever, and the world must know your face. Do\nnot disappoint me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse not!\u201d \n</p>\n<p>And\nin that moment, he resolves to keep that promise as much as he can,\nwith everything he has to give.</p>\n<hr><p>Their\nmaster has been away a lot recently; there is trouble in the capital,\nrumours of traitors high up within the Cerberus Assembly. Rogue\nmages, making off with important state secrets. Caleb and the others\ndon\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but their master seems troubled. Not\nthat they have much time to wonder, as their workload is increasing.</p>\n<p>Even\nwhile he is away on business to Rexxentrum though, Master Ikithon\nwill meet them in the dungeons under the city; he has taught them to\nopen the portal under the conservatory themselves, a great honour and\na great weight of responsibility. They are undertaking more and more\nof the interrogations on their own, too. \n</p>\n<p>It\nbecomes almost routine, even a welcome respite from the rest of their\nwork.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon; they are all nervous, and tensions run high.\nAstrid and Eodwulf fight over nothing, and do not speak for a week,\nand Caleb is miserable and frustrated the whole time acting as their\nintermediary. They make up in tears, a little later, and it is a\nrelief, but the pressure remains. Astrid takes to constantly\nreorganising her collection of poisons, the little bottles\nmeticulously labeled and cataloged. Eodwulf paces their sitting\nroom in front of the fire, eyes half closed, lips moving slightly as\nhe runs through spells in his mind. Caleb finds himself writing\neverything down, even more so than before; it helps him to organise\nhis thoughts, but his room is awash with paper, stacks and piles of\nit, going through pots of ink and pens at an alarming rate.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon, their master says; sooner than they expected,\nbut their master needs them to reach their full potential sooner\nrather than later. He needs to have them trained soon, so that they\ncan aid him at his side, fully within his trust. \n</p>\n<p>No\nlonger students, but full members of the highest circle of mages in\nthe Empire. \n</p>\n<p>The\nprospect is both unnerving and exhilarating. Caleb thinks about how\nproud his parents will be, and it only makes him push himself harder.</p>\n<p>And\nso they study, and study more, and practice and prepare themselves.\nThere will be a final test of their abilities, they all know. Their\nmaster has not told them what it is yet, but they throw all of their\nstrength and academic abilities into preparing, into becoming\nstronger and cleverer. Caleb goes to bed each night exhausted, his\nmind thrumming with spells and lists and facts and incantations, and\nsometimes the screams of the traitors in the dungeons. Sometimes\nEodwulf or Astrid are with him, pressed close in the dark, or falling\nasleep over their work in front of the fireplace.</p>\n<p>And\nthen, one day, their master comes to them with an announcement. They\nlook at each other with trepidation in their eyes; could this be it?</p>\n<p>But\nno; Master Ikithon surprises them with the gift of some time off. He\ntells them he is giving them two weeks to return to Blumenthal and\ntheir families, once more before they graduate and assume positions\nin Rexxentrum. \n</p>\n<p>He\ntells them to enjoy the time, as afterwards their lives will change\nentirely. \n</p>\n<p>(Caleb\ndoesn\u2019t understand until later how true that statement is.)</p>\n<p>Before\nthey go, he wishes them each farewell with his strange blessing, one\nlast time. Master Ikithon\u2019s fingers feel warm against Caleb\u2019s\ntemple under the lightest of touches. The words sound familiar, an\necho of the years they have spent, of all the work and all of\nthemselves that they have given. A binding of their hearts to his\nmind, the three of them trusting their teacher implicitly. \u201cStay\non this path and don\u2019t turn aside, and it will take you far.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\nhold hands, all three in a row, as they begin their journey home.</p>",

They are just children, at the beginning.</p><p>At\nthe end, they are something else entirely. \n</p>[[MORE]]<p>They\nare eleven years old and they are friends already, even before they\nare accepted into the Academy. Even before they meet the man who will\nsee something special in them, pluck them from amongst its ranks of\nbrilliance, of students who hold promise. \n</p><p>The\nnight they find out they will all be going together, Eodwulf and\nCaleb sneak out of their homes, climbing the tree in Astrid\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s garden. There is a rickety little treehouse up there, and\nthe three of them sit and look at the stars until the dawn comes.\nIt\u2019s summer, and it\u2019s warm even in these cool northern latitudes,\nand the night is fragrant and bright with possibility.</p><p>After\nall, everything they could have possibly wanted and more is before\nthem; they need only reach out and take it.</p><hr><p>Blumenthal\nhas never had three of its children honoured so; they throw a\nfestival for them in the village square, a sent-off party one long\nnight near the end of summer. They all wear their best. Someone has\ngiven Eodwulf a crown of pink flowers. It suits him; he has dark skin\nand black hair, and the colour looks good against it, Caleb thinks.\nThe crown\u2019s a little too big and falls down over one eye as he\ngrins shyly at the others. Someone grabs Astrid\u2019s arm and puts one\non her too. It\u2019s yellow, matching her golden-brown skin, her mane\nof hair the colour of old, dusty gold woven into a long braid. She\npushes her thick, wire-rimmed glasses up her nose and squares her\nshoulders in determination, as though she is carrying the full weight\nand responsibility of a true crown. \n</p><p>Caleb\nhas a crown too; his is blue as the summer sky, and the pollen and\nthe scent makes him sneeze a little as a few petals fall down over\nhis face.</p><p>He\nwears it all evening, taking it off at night and laying it on his\nbedside table when he goes to sleep in his own bed for the last time.\nHe will return to Blumenthal, he knows this. But he\u2019s not sure that\nit will ever feel like home anymore, with the bright future stretched\nout before him, the path just waiting for him to walk down it.</p><hr><p>They\nhave been at the academy for a few years when they are told that they\nhave been chosen to be taught privately by Master Trent Ikithon.\nThey\u2019ve actually heard of him before; whispers abound, he\u2019s one\nof the greatest arcanists in the whole Empire, he\u2019s uniquely\ncommitted to both the defence of the realm and the training of the\nmost talented young mages, the best and brightest. He\u2019s tough, it\u2019s\nrumoured; he will not take anything other than the very best, and he\nwill punish failure harshly. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nEodwulf and Astrid cannot stop grinning, as they pack up their few\npossessions for the journey. They know, after all, that if they are\ntogether then they are three times as strong, three times as clever\nand talented. \n</p><p>The\nfact that all of them were chosen is proof enough of that.</p><hr><p>They\neach have their own strengths, and they must find them and train\nthem; that is Master Ikithon\u2019s very first lesson. \n</p><p>After\nhe takes them into his tutelage, the first two weeks are spent\nassessing their individual abilities. He has their files and progress\nreports from the Academy, of course, the records of the scholarships\nthey were each awarded, letters of recommendation, signed and sealed.\nHe barely touches the files; just as he picked them out, he tells\nthem he prefers to use his own experience with such things, to see\nwith his own eyes. They should too, he says; doing so will make it\neasier for them to bring out their full magical potential. \n</p><p>(They\nall have so much potential; it\u2019s something all three of them have\nknown for years now, but somehow when Master Ikithon says it it holds\nall the more promise. It makes them want to prove him right, to show\nhim what they are, and what they can be.)</p><p>They\nwill each complete their full, comprehensive education in history,\nreligion, a variety of languages both common and rare, mathematics,\nrhetoric, politics, natural philosophy, and of course magic. But in\nthis last, they must choose the areas they want to specialise in. \n</p><p>Most\nmages, Master Ikithon tells them, wait until later on in their\neducation to choose a school of magic to specialise in. <i>But you\nthree</i>, he says, smiling at them, <i>are not most mages</i>. They\nare the very brightest young minds in the Empire, and his course of\nstudy will be duly accelerated and advanced. And so they will each\npick a school of magic \u2013 or two if they choose, as ambition is to\nbe encouraged - to study, according to their strengths and their\ninterests once they discover them. They will have to work hard, he\nwarns them; they are not here for an easy few years. But if they\napply themselves then they will rise amongst the ranks of the\nAcademy, then go on to defend the Empire, and who knows to what\nheights they will ascend? \n</p><p>It\nis what they all want, more than anything. \n</p><p>And\nso, their new master spends some time assessing them. Already it is\nhard, demanding work. He has them show him to spells they already\nknow, subjects them to written tests and interviews them at length\nabout their interests, their hopes and dreams and aspirations. \n</p><p>Eventually,\nthe specialisations are chosen. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nwill study the school of illusion magic, with a secondary focus on\nenchantment. The two can be much greater than the sum of their parts\nwhen used together, their master tells Eodwulf, as he reports it back\nto Caleb and Astrid. It is no small thing to be able to look at a\nperson and enchant them so that they spill out the secret they keep\nlocked deep in their heart, especially if the knowledge can then be\nused to spin them an illusion that can either heal or break them. It\nis hard, on a personal level; this much, Master Ikithon acknowledges.\nBut he believes that Eodwulf can handle it, given proper guidance. \n</p><p>When\nEodwulf tells him this, Caleb agrees, and is happy for him; Eodwulf\nwas always the most empathetic of them, a sensitive and intensely\ncreative child. There is a small, hopeful spark in Eodwulf\u2019s eyes,\nand Caleb is happy for his friend.</p><p>(Caleb\nremembers the older boys who would hurt Eodwulf as a child, would\ntake turns trying to make him cry just because it was easy, because\nthey could. Eodwulf had always hated being so beholden to them, and\nCaleb supposes this is his way of fighting back, many years too\nlate.)</p><p>Astrid\ncomes and tells them that she has chosen to study necromancy, with\nconjuration. Caleb is surprised for a moment, until he thinks about\nit a little more, and then he\u2019s not. Master Ikithon, she explains,\nallowed her a little more choice in what she wanted to study. He had\njudged her the most resilient and hardworking of the three, stable of\nmind and always meticulous. Too many who have had the power to\ncontrol others, to bend the powers of life and death to their will,\nhave fallen off the righteous path, he tells Astrid. But that only\nmakes mages who can control these forces all the more valuable to the\nEmpire, and with her level-headed calm and emotional toughness, he\nbelieves that she is able to handle it. Conjuration, too, takes a\nsteadier hand and an even temperament to get right. \n</p><p>(Caleb\nwonders if Master Ikithon looked deeply enough into all their pasts\nto be aware that Astrid\u2019s brother died the winter he was four and\nshe was nine. She had nearly died too, but she had held on long\nenough by days for the snow to melt and the way to be clear for the\nmedicine to come from the capital to cure her. Since then, she has\nboth feared and been fascinated by death beyond anything else. Caleb\nwonders if this was behind her choice. He does not tell Master\nIkithon this; it\u2019s not his to tell, and he is not asked. He\nsupposes it is likely he knows anyway, though.)</p><p>Caleb\nis called last; he will be specialising jointly in transmutation and\nevocation. A true joint specialisation is a difficult task, not for\nthe complacent. Master Ikithon tells him that he is proud of him, and\nCaleb feels his face glow bright with satisfaction; compliments, from\ntheir master, are rare and precious. \n</p><p>But\nCaleb, his master says, has not only the strongest academic record\nbut also the most raw arcane power underneath it. Transmutation \u2013\nhis own particular area of expertise, no less \u2013 is a natural fit\nfor the academically gifted, as it requires a great deal of knowledge\nof substances, the non-magical basis of chemistry, of alchemy and the\ncomposition of things as they occur naturally in order to understand\nthe fundamental laws that govern the changing of one thing into\nanother. And Caleb will be learning the rigourous first principles;\nMaster Ikithon does not believe in a superficial approach to magical\neducation, and with transmutation in particular a solid grounding is\nvital. \n</p><p>And\nthen he will learn evocation. Here, there comes a warning. Many\npeople think, his teacher tells him, that evocation is all raw,\nuntamed power, righteous fire and destruction. But it is also one of\nthe most dangerous schools of magic for the caster; a good grasp of evocation magic\nis far more about learning control and mastery, lest the power the\nmage wields consume them. Fire, in the right hands, he tells Caleb,\nis as much a creative force as a destructive one.</p><p>He\ntells Caleb that if anyone can wield that power, it is him.</p><p>At\nthe time, Caleb glows with ecstatic joy, and immediately throws\nhimself into his studies.</p><hr><p>(It\ndoes not occur to Caleb until many, many years later that it was\nperhaps no coincidence that none of them were chosen to study\ndivination or abjuration. Seeing through illusions to the truth of\nthings, and evading and defending against magical attacks\u2026 at the\ntime, Caleb though what the others thought, that this was far less\nexciting for a young mage who was set to go far than magic that could\nbe used to attack. Besides, he didn\u2019t think that it was any of\ntheir strengths, and surely he could trust his teacher to be able to\nsee the truth of that from the beginning.)</p><p>(It\nonly strikes him so many years later, but he is a different person by\nthen, a whole new life of broken, jagged pieces replacing the shining\nbright one that he had imagined.)</p><hr><p>They\ncome to think of their master\u2019s house as home. The house is a\nbeautiful one, out in the country, away from the bustle and\npoliticking of Rexxentrum. The mountains march far off in the\ndistance, but the house itself is in a sheltered, green valley, a\nlittle warmer and more sundrenched than the city of marble and metal\nand slate, however grand and elegant it may be to Caleb\u2019s eyes. \n</p><p>Caleb\nloves everything about the valley and their master\u2019s house there.\nHe loves the way that the grass ripples and waves in the wind as they\ncome down the mountain road from the pass in their coach, and he\nloves the pear trees that grow in the sheltered garden. He loves the\nlibrary above all; being surrounded by so many books is a blessing he\nhasn\u2019t yet come to take for granted and probably never will.\nThere\u2019s so many of them, three levels with beautifully carved and\ndark-polished rolling ladders so he doesn\u2019t need to ask anyone if\nhe wants the highest ones. If he\u2019s got no other work to do, he can\njust sit there and read all day, in the reading room where the sun\nfilters down in stripes through the half-shuttered windows with their\ncomfortably-upholstered alcoves. If he wants, he can sit in a window\nseat curled up with a book for hours, and no one will tell him to go\nand do his chores instead because this is his <i>life</i> now, it\u2019s\nall part of his studies and besides, his master is rich enough to\nhave household servants who go about on quiet feet. There\u2019s also a\nwhole walk-in store cupboard of common spell components, which he can\njust take anything from; more dangerous or valuable components are\nkept personally by Master Ikithon, but Caleb knows he only has to ask\nfor it and tell his master why he needs it, and it will be his. \n</p><p>He\nloves that he and Eodwulf and Astrid have rooms next to each other,\nall three in a row. Their rooms open onto a little common sitting\nroom, with a cozy fireplace that they share. In the evenings, after\ndining with their master when he is there, or alone when he is away\non business in Rexxentrum or Zadash, they usually go back there and\ncurl up together on one of the soft chairs. Sometimes, they speak\nabout magic, and their studies, one or other of them showing the\nothers a new spell they\u2019ve learned with pride, or working through\nsomething they\u2019ve been finding difficult to master. Sometimes,\nthough, they just talk, their faces lit by the warm light of the\nfire. They grow close; they were close before of course, Blumenthal\nwas a small village and they\u2019ve all known each other for most of\ntheir lives, have seen each other grow up. But now, they grow closer\nthan they had ever thought possible, sharing their hopes and dreams\nfor the bright future they are bound for. \n</p><p>They\nare all homesick, from time to time. But none of them speak of it;\nthey don\u2019t need to, and besides, even to give voice to such a\nthought would feel wrong, ungrateful. \n</p><p>Besides,\nthey have each other, and as long as the three are together then to\nwhatever greatness they come, they will each always have that little\npiece of their history, reminding them where they came from.</p><p>It\ndoes not occur to any of them that there might come a time when the\nthree of them will not be together. It seems unthinkable, then.</p><hr><p>As\nwell as the lessons that Master Ikithon teaches them all together \u2013\ntheir general studies, and the magical theory and basic spells that\nevery mage should know \u2013 they each have private lessons, once a\nweek for two hours. These sessions take place in Master Ikithon\u2019s\nbrightly lit study, with its wide windows looking out onto the\ngarden, books and wood panelling covering the other three walls.\nCaleb loves these lessons; he sits in a chair at the other side of\nMaster Ikithon\u2019s desk, and his teacher asks him about what he has\nbeen learning that week. The three students spend a lot of time\nreading alone, and it is wonderful to be able to talk about what he\nreads, to ask questions of someone who actually knows the answers. As\na child, Caleb would read every book he could get his hands on, but\nno one in Blumenthal ever had the time or the knowledge for a proper\ndiscussion.</p><p>His\nteacher does. He sits calmly on the other side of his desk, sometimes\nasking a question that is designed to puzzle, to challenge;\nsometimes, Caleb can\u2019t answer them, but that only makes him more\ndetermined to find the answer by the next time. He is meticulous, he\nlikes to get them right; if he makes mistakes, Master Ikithon gets a\nlook of disappointment, a frown line deepening between his eyes,\nwhich grow a little colder. He is the sort of person that makes one\nfeel they must not disappoint.</p><p>After\ntheir discussion, they usually practice some magic; Caleb is learning\nspells as fast as he can, his fingers perpetually stained with ink\nfrom copying them down into one of his many notebooks. He always\nfeels a flicker of nervousness before showing them off though; Master\nIkithon is strong, stronger than any mage in the whole Empire, maybe.\n\n</p><p>He\ndoes not stand for failure in this, either. Magic, Master Ikithon\nsays, when used in the real world, can easily strike down the caster\nif handled incorrectly. It is not a toy but a tool, a weapon, and\nmust be treated as such. \n</p><p>Clumsiness\nand carelessness are thus punished severely. \n</p><p>Caleb\nlets a fireball slip from his control one summer morning as the light\nstreams in the window. It begins to disappate in the air, arcane fire\nsending distortions crackling upwards into the sunlit air above, and\nhe panics, sliding on the carpet to try to grasp the fire again, to\ncatch it back in his fist like a trapped bird. But instead of bending\nto his will, the fire slips from his grasp once more, flaring bright\nbefore vanishing to nothing. \n</p><p>A\nfew papers drift off Master Ikithon\u2019s desk in the downdraft, a\nlittle singed at one edge. They glow but do not catch. Nevertheless\nthey are a little blackened by the time they reach the carpet. \n</p><p>Caleb\nstares at them, his eyes wide as he looks up to meet his master\u2019s;\nsure enough, there is that disappointed look, that slight tightening\nof the mouth, and Caleb\u2019s feels as though his heart were tearing in\ntwo. \n</p><p>There\nare punishments, on days like this. \n</p><hr><p>Caleb\nis back in their common room, laying a rag soaked in a healing potion\non the deep gouges on his upper arm; arcane blades bite deeper than\nthe regular kind, and the pain takes longer to subside. Still, he can\ntake it. As his master says, he is strong, stronger than the others.\nHe deserved this; he\u2019s learned from it. \n</p><p>He\nclenches his fist experimentally, the pain running up his whole\nlacerated arm. The healing potion must be doing its work. When the\ncuts were fresh, he would have been screaming just trying to move his\nfingers, with the tear and burn of ruined skin, gashes deep enough to\ncatch the tendons in his wrist.</p><p>Caleb\ntakes a new rag, dips it in the potion and applies it to his skin. It\nis soothing and tingles a little. \n</p><p>There\nis a store room just for healing potions; they go through many, many\nof them. Their master will be angry with them, after all, if they\nallow his punishments to leave a scar, and so only magical healing\nwill do. After all, to scar them is not his goal. His punishments, he\ntakes pains to tell them, are for the purposes of teaching only. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon is not an inhumane person, after all. He is too indulgent to\nhis students, some at the Academy may even say.</p><p>Caleb\nsighs, looking over at the torn and bloody sleeve of his shirt that\nhe has taken off to clean and heal his arm. He must wash and mend the\nshirt; it was one he brought from home, after all. \n</p><p>Just\nthen, the door opens and in come Astrid and Eodwulf, midway through a\ndiscussion on the differences in casting gestures for holy and arcane\ncasting. Astrid wrote an assigned essay on it last week, and she is\nexplaining it to Eodwulf. \n</p><p>When\nthey see Caleb, they immediately break off speaking. They do not have\nto say anything; this is familiar, a ritual even. Astrid sighs,\nsympathetic, lays a hand on his shoulder in wordless support. Eodwulf\nsits down on the chair next to Caleb, taking the cloth from him and\nbeginning to wash the wounds. Caleb nods gratefully; the wounds are\nnearly fully healed now, the skin visibly knitting together to its\nusual pale, freckled smoothness again, but he appreciates the\ncloseness. Astrid sits down on his other side, heedless of the fact\nthat the deep armchair is only really meant for one, and begins to\ncast prestidigitation to clean Caleb\u2019s bloody shirt. After she is\nfinished, she casts mending, and at once it is good as new. By this\ntime, Eodwulf is finished healing Caleb\u2019s wounds, and the remaining\ndregs of the potion in the dish and the cloth are pink with blood,\nbut his arm is back to normal.</p><p><i>Good</i>.\nHe will need to be able to practice his spells, he thinks. He must\nbecome stronger, so he does not disappoint Master Ikithon again.</p><p>But\nnot quite yet. The others hold him between them, again an unspoken\nritual. They lean close; they both know that it helps him in moments\nlike this, to have the physicality and the grounding of it. They both\nunderstand, as if it\u2019s not him its one of them. \n</p><p>He\nis pressed between the two of them, and at long last, he begins to\nshake and sob, even though the pain is gone. Somehow, being so close\nto them allows him to let himself cry, and he does, dampening the\nshoulder of Astrid\u2019s shirt with his tears of pain and humiliation,\nas she holds him and Eodwulf strokes his hair. \n</p><p>They\nsit there until the sun goes down, and eventually, Caleb has calmed\ntoo, the pain replaced by weariness as he begins to doze, and finally\nthe tremble in his hands is stilled. \n</p><hr><p>Most\nof the time though, his private lessons do not end like this. If\nMaster Ikithon is happy with his work, then there will be a rare,\nbenevolent smile, a word of praise even. And there is something else\ntoo; a ritual, that comes at the end of the meeting. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon sits him down, and lays two gentle fingers on the side of\nCaleb\u2019s head, just at his temple, then briefly on the other side.\nIt feels almost like a blessing, a benediction. There is magic in\nthat touch, but it is so subtle that Caleb can barely detect it, let\nalone understand it. Not that he spends much time questioning it; the\ntruth that his master has his best interests at heart is one that he\nholds closer than any other, and Caleb trusts him implicitely.</p><p>\u201cVery\ngood, Caleb. You did well today.\u201d And then, the words with which\nhis master always ends their meetings: \u201cstay on this path and don\u2019t\nturn aside, and it will take you far.\u201d</p><hr><p>(There\nare things that don\u2019t match up, sometimes. Because he is very\nperceptive, Caleb notices them occasionally, just. Sometimes, it\u2019s\neveryday things; he will find himself more often in the situation\nwhere he walks through a door and forgets why. Other times, it\u2019s a\nlittle harder to dismiss; he will find himself at the end of a\ncorridor without remembering having walked there, or there will be a\nbloodstain on his cuff that is just a little bit too large to be from\na papercut, even if he remembered getting one.)</p><p>(If\nhe had asked Master Ikithon about these occurrances, they would have\nbeen waved away with a kind smile, advice to get a little more sleep\nat night if he finds himself forgetting things, so that he may\ncontinue to excel in his studies.)</p><p>(In\nthe event though, Caleb mentions nothing of these lapses; he doesn\u2019t\neven tell Astrid and Eodwulf, let alone his master. He wouldn\u2019t\nwant to be thought of as weak or falling behind after all, or worse,\nunworthy of his master\u2019s teaching.)</p><hr><p>Astrid\nhas been working on a particular spell; her hands are dusted black\nwith charcoal when she bursts out of her room to show Caleb and\nEodwulf, who are sitting back to back and studying by the fire. They\nboth look up when she enters the room, the scent of incense drifting\nafter her in a swirling cloud, a proud grin on her face. \n</p><p>On\none arm she wears one of the thick, slightly scorched and stained\nleather gloves that they wear sometimes for their alchemy lessons. \n</p><p>On\nher gloved hand stands a sparrow hawk, feathers a little ruffled but\neyes bright, immediately swivelling to catch the two of them in its\ngaze.</p><p>Eodwulf\u2019s\neyes widen. \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nmy own familiar!\u201d Astrid\u2019s eyes are shining with pride, bright as\nthe hawk\u2019s. \u201cHis name is Hieronymus.\u201d</p><p>Eodwulf\nraises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve really thought this through, haven\u2019t\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\nI love him already.\u201d</p><p>The\nbird caws, as though in agreement, and cocks his sleek feathered head\ntowards Astrid\u2019s. \n</p><p>Hieronymus\nbecomes a part of their lives, for a while. Astrid changes his form\noften; not long after she first summons him she gathers the\ncomponents she needs once again, and experiments with the form of a\nbearded dragon, then an adder. For a few months he is often found\ncurled around Astrid\u2019s arm or around her neck, gently scenting the\nair with his little forked tongue as she studies in the light of the\nlamp. Then he is a mouse, then a cat, a raven, and, for a few\nmemorable days, an octopus, living in the pond outside in the garden.\nAstrid loves Hieronymus, changing his form to indulge him, she\ndeclares. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nwatching them together, thinks that it helps Astrid, to have him\nthere. When he is in a form with fur, her fingers are always\nstroking, touching it. When he is a serpent, she winds her hand\naround his tail lazily as she thinks. \n</p><p>It\nhelps her though, and for that, Caleb is glad. \n</p><hr><p>Master\nIkithon is a good teacher, but a hard one, and as they have grown\nstronger he has only asked more of them; they are not children, not\nanymore, and they must learn mental fortitude. They must learn not to\nlet themselves be held hostage by their feelings, never to let pity\nget in the way of doing what must be done.</p><p>When\none of them fails, now the others suffer too. \n</p><p>When\none of them fails, they must test their mettle to prove to him that\nthey are still worthy of his training, he says, with logic that none\nof them can argue with. They must work through some of the more\nunpleasant but sadly necessary sides of keeping the Empire safe and\nfree of traitors. \n</p><p>They\nmust prove their faith by demonstrating their latest achievements on\nthe others. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis screaming, as Astrid\u2019s spell strikes him in the chest with a\ncrackling, paralysing ray of dark necrotic energy. He can feel it\ndraining his life force, setting his stomach to churning and cold\nsweat beading on his brow as his vision tunnels. He gasps, as nausea\nwashes over him and ugly black blemishes crawl their way up his arms.</p><p>He\nis on his hands and knees and he can see Astrid, through the hair\nthat has fallen over his eyes. She is standing with her hand\nextended, still channeling the last of the spell. Her teeth are\ngritted, her eyes fixed on him with that forced detachment that they\nall know. Some hair has come loose from her braid at the front, the\nsheen of sweat sticking it to her brow the only signal that betrays\nhow much effort it is taking her to maintain this, to watch Caleb\nwrithe on the floor and not turn aside. Master Ikithon stands behind\nher, Eodwulf on the other side, his hands clasped tight enough to\ndrain the blood from the knuckles as he watches. \n</p><p>Caleb\ndoes not look up, at either Astrid or Eodwulf. He knows from\nexperience that eye contact only makes the it harder for them. If he\nlooks up, it will go on longer, and he does not want them to suffer\nanymore. \n</p><p>It\nwas only a small mistake that she made; just a slight slip in one of\nher spells, but she had wasted a diamond with an ill-cast spell.\nMaster Ikithon is teaching her to be careful with components, a\nlesson that the three of them have never had any pressing need to\nlearn, though an important one. \n</p><p>She\nis being made an example of, and they all know it. Caleb kneels\nretching and convulsing on the floor and wishing he could take her\npain on himself, too. Eodwulf, his face bloodless and his eyes wide\nwith paralysed, forced stillness, is thinking the same, Caleb knows. \n</p><hr><p>\u201cNo,\nslower. You must <i>control</i> the flames, the heat. Keep the water\njust short of the boil for now.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\ngrits his teeth and nods at his teacher, laying his palm just shy of\nflat under the base of the copper tank. Heating slowly has never been his strong point, and Master Ikithon has a way of picking out the little\nimperfections in his casting technique, of making him practice them\nuntil they are no longer imperfections. \n</p><p>He\nallows a thin sheet of flame to coat his palm, heating the water from\nbeneath, and focuses on control. The goal of the exercise is to heat\nthe water as slowly as possible; it should take an hour at the very\nleast to bring it to the boil. \n</p><p>They\u2019ve\npracticed with wax, tar and oil before, which are more forgiving,\ntaking more heat before they are bubbling and frothing at the boil.\nWater requires a lighter touch, the greatest mastery of the flow of\nheat through his fingers. \n</p><p>Still,\nhis teacher said he was ready and Caleb is determined to prove him\nright.</p><hr><p>He\nmasters it, in the end. He shows Astrid and Eodwulf proudly, keeping\nAstrid\u2019s old copper tea-kettle hot for hours with the slow heat\nfrom his palm. The tea is far too strong and bitter by the end, but\nthe other two drink it, loyally and proudly, as the cold edges into\nthe room. It\u2019ll be the first frost of the year tonight, after all;\nfire and warmth and company are all comforting.</p><p>Caleb\nis still buoyed up by the excitement of learning a new spell late\ninto the night, and so it does not occur to him then that this is not\nthe only way that such a skill could be used. \n</p><hr><p>They\nare losing the Zemnian accents to their words, slowly. \n</p><p>At\nthe beginning, of course, they used to speak Zemnian amongst\nthemselves. Now, though, they speak Common increasingly; they\u2019ve\ngrown accustomed to it. Sometimes, one of them will forget a word \u2013\nAstrid snapping her fingers in frustration as she tries to think of\nit, or Eodwulf pulling a face, a self-deprecating laugh and and a\nquick mime, a gesture in the air. <i>You know\u2026that thing</i>. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis not usually the one who forgets. But whenever it happens, it is an\nunspoken agreement that the others will hurry to supply the missing\nword. Especially if they are speaking to Master Ikithon. His\nimpression of them and their conduct matters, of course, above all\nothers. \n</p><p>(He\nnever quite ordered them not to use their mother tongue; not in so\nmany words. But, they all know, it wouldn\u2019t do for him to think\nthat any of them wants to exclude him, for then he might think that\nthey have something to hide; then he might think them ungrateful.)</p><p>(Besides,\nthey are growing more comfortable with Common, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s\ngood practice, they each think. Practice for those bright-shining\nfutures that are laid before their feet.)</p><p>Later\nthey learn other languages, too; they learn Sylvan, and Caleb loves\nthe way the syllables sound on his tongue. He\u2019s good at languages;\nhe seems to pick them up easier than the others, as he does most\nthings. They learn Celestial, and it\u2019s harder but more rewarding;\nthe grammar is strange to Caleb, all complex noun inflections like\nhe\u2019s never heard. He masters it too, in the end, spends nights\nreading ancient tomes just for the thrill of it, just because he can.\n\n</p><p>(He\nand Eodwulf and Astrid speak it sometimes to each other, taking a\nquiet thrill in speaking the language of the Gods. It feels right,\nsomehow. For are the three of them not bright with possibility? These\ngolden three can do anything they set their minds to, even scraping\nthe stars, with Master Ikithon to guide them there of course.)</p><hr><p>\u201cCaleb,\nEodwulf, look what I can do!\u201d \n</p><p>They\nboth rush over, to see what Astrid has done. They find her at the\ntable, and on the table are three small white objects. They are about\nto ask what they are, when Eodwulf draws in a breathy gasp; Caleb\nrecognises what is going on at the same moment.</p><p>They\nare three dead mice, fresh blood staining the fur around their noses\nand mouths. \n</p><p>Astrid\nraises a hand over the mice, and a moment later their bodies are\ntwitching grotesquely, a motion that is life-like, he supposes, but\nsomehow just a little bit off. A moment later, the twitching is\ngrowing stronger, and then the mice are moving, flipping upwards onto\nall fours and then each standing up on their hind legs in a way that\nis utterly different to any living mouse Caleb has ever seen.</p><p>Astrid\nwiggles her fingers, and the mice begin to dance. As they do she\nlooks up at the two of them proudly. Hieronymus is a snake again,\nand he curls over one of her shoulders, tongue lashing out hungrily.\nBut she pushes him back, staying fiercely focussed on the mice on the\ntable in front of her. They leave tiny, bloody smudges of footprints\non the wood of the tabletop.</p><p>It\nis a disturbing sight, but in that moment, Astrid looks so proud and\nhappy, the mere sight makes Caleb\u2019s heart sing. \n</p><hr><p>(There\nare no forbidden books in the library; what there are are books that\nhis mind slides away from, eyes that usually take in every detail\ngliding over their titles without taking them in. Luckily though,\nthese books are not on his reading lists, so it does not impact his\nstudies in any way.)</p><hr><p>Behind\nthe house there is a garden, and in the garden, there is a\nconservatory. The conservatory is bright and spacious, with wicker\nchairs and hanging baskets of flowers. \n</p><p>In\nthe corner of the conservatory, there is a plain wooden door that\nleads to the garden, and they have never seen it opened. Caleb,\nAstrid and Eodwulf don\u2019t think much of it, until they learn that it\ncannot be opened except with a key that Master Ikithon keeps on him\nat all times. \n</p><p>They\nhave been studying with him for about eight months when he first\ntakes them out to the conservatory and unlocks the door. Before they\ncan ask what he is doing, they see the door swing open for the first\ntime. Beyond it, where there should be the garden, there is a stone\nstaircase, a tight spiral lit by magical, ever-burning lamps, going\ndownwards.</p><p>They\nfollow Master Ikithon down the stairs. \n</p><p>The\nspiral goes on for a very long time, longer than Caleb expects;\nthough he\u2019s not quite sure if it really goes down so far or even\nhow much time has passed. There might well be some magic in it, a\nsubtle one he doesn\u2019t recognise yet. None of them talk on the way\ndown, they just keep following, the three students in a row behind\ntheir teacher.</p><p>Eventually,\nthe staircase ends. There is another locked door, there, and this one\ncertainly is magic; the doorjamb and the door itself seems to thrum\nwith it, though the spell is too powerful for him to have learned\nyet. He casts Detect Magic, discretely; he\u2019s in the habit of it, he\nlikes to know things even before Master Ikithon explains them. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb suspected, the door is radiating the bright glow of high-level\nconjuration magic. He looks over at Astrid, sees her frowning as she\nlays a tentative hand on the doorjamb. \n</p><p>Before\nany of them do anything else, though, their master turns to them. In\nthe glow of the magical lights, Master Ikithon\u2019s face is cast in\nstark light and shadow. \u201cOnce we cross this threshold, my bright\nones,\u201d he tells them, \u201cknow that there is a trust between us,\nabove and beyond what has been before.\u201d He raises a hand, smiling\nonce again that benevolent, almost fatherly smile, though it is\nsomewhat melancholic now. \u201cI know, I have already placed a great\ndeal of trust in you three. And I don\u2019t mean to stop now, but there\nare things that you will see and do that require\u2026some extra\ncommitment, on your parts.\u201d He looks steadily at each of them, gaze\npiercing suddenly. Caleb stares determinedly back, holding the look\nuntil it moves on. \u201cCan I trust you to do what must be done for the\nEmpire, to never break under pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He\nnods, smiling once more, the sharpness in him gone almost as soon as\nit came. \u201cI knew I could.\u201d</p><p>And\nwith that, he opens the door for the first time. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb had suspected, the air smells different down here, and the\nchange in temperature and humidity is noticable; it confirms his\nsuspicion that the door is a portal of some kind, to somewhere other\nthan under their master\u2019s house. The corridor is not dark,\nprecisely, but it is dim, the magical lights lower here. They are in\na corridor with heavy steel vault doors in rows along each side. \n</p><p>The\ndoor vanishes behind them. Caleb cannot quite suppress a shiver, even\nthough it isn\u2019t cold.</p><p>\u201cWhere\nare we?\u201d asks Eodwulf. \n</p><p>\u201cWe\nare in Rexxentrum, far beneath the citadel and the castle keep.\u201d\nMaster Ikithon smiles, mildly. \u201cI am your teacher, and teaching\noccupies much of my time these days. But as you may know, I am\ninvolved, in the capacity of\u2026ah, shall we say, more of a trusted\nconsultant now, in matters of intelligence, and specifically of\nquashing rebellion from within the Empire even before it takes root.\u201d\nHe clasps his hands, looks at the three of them standing before him.\n\u201cI am most pleased to inform you, my pupils, that you have come far\nenough that the council has allowed me to\u2026enlist your help with\nthis, in certain ways.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf and Astrid exchange looks of excitement; they have heard\nmuch speculation about their master\u2019s role in the Empire, and\nrumours swirl of an exciting life in the keeping of secrets and\nspying, of daring missions to oust traitors. Could it possibly be\ntrue? And are they really being brought in on that noble task?</p><p>\u201cTo\nwit\u201d their teacher continues, continuing to walk them down the\nstone corridor with its ever burning lamps, \u201cI have decided that\nnow is the time to begin to train you in the art of negotiation. It\nwill serve you well, to be able to glean more information from a\nperson than you give away, and with the strength of your magic now,\nyou are well on your way to becoming just what the Empire needs to\nmaintain the peace.\u201d He stops in front of a great metal-bound door,\ncovered in heavy, complicated locks, both mechanical and glowing with\nthe arcane thrum of spells of locking and warding. He touches a spot\non the door and the locks begin to open one by one, the well-oiled\nslide of steel on steel making almost no noise. After a moment, the\ndoor behind him swings open, revealing another corridor lined with\nheavy locked doors. \n</p><p>Their\nmaster turns around to look at them, hands open towards them.\n\u201cTraitors all, in these cells\u201d he says. \u201cBound to be executed.\nBut it would be a waste to do so without finding out what secrets\nthey can tell us, that we can then use to make the Empire safer,\nwould it not?\u201d</p><p>The\nthree nod fervently; it makes sense, as does everything their teacher\nsays. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon gifts them a rare smile, turning to the corridor. He walks to\na door on the right, opening it to reveal a dwarven woman, dressed in\nrags, her face smeared with blood and grime. She is shackled hand and\nfoot, but it is her eyes that are truly frightening. They seem to\nburn with a cold hatred, an anger and resentment and defiance such as\nCaleb has never seen before. He exchanges looks with Astrid and\nEodwulf, knowing they are having the same thought: <i>this, then, is\nwhat a traitor looks like.</i></p><p>Master\nIkithon, however, seems unfazed, and spreads his hands out to them.\n\u201cThen let us begin our first lesson.\u201d And with that, he walks\ninto the cell. \n</p><p>He\ndoes not look to see if they are following after; he knows that they\nare. \n</p><hr><p>The\nsound of screams of pain, inflicted by their own hands, is already\none that is known to them. \n</p><p>It\nbecomes familiar, the more times they return to that dungeon under\nthe earth. It becomes commonplace, even, though when that happened\nnone of them can quite tell. \n</p><hr><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf are being punished, today. \n</p><p>Last\nnight they had fallen asleep over their written work together, heads\npillowed on each other\u2019s shoulders as they had studied for a test.\nAstrid had come back from a lesson to find them, and she had woken\nthem to keep studying \u2013 knowing, of course, exactly what they would\nwant her to do \u2013 but it had not been enough. They had taken the\ntest in the morning, and Eodwulf had failed. Caleb had scraped a\npassing grade, at least by Academy standards. But then, this is not\nthe academy; only the best is good enough. It is enough to distress\nCaleb terribly; usually, his grades are impeccable, but he has been\nputting in extra work lately, trying to add more and more time in the\ndungeons too. He needs to be stronger, he knows. Less forgiving, less\nmerciful. \n</p><p>Perhaps\nMaster Ikithon knows this, for this time, it is Caleb who is chosen\nto inflict the punishment. \n</p><p>He\nlooks into Eodwulf\u2019s eyes as he closes his fingers around his\nfriend\u2019s wrist, which is trembling very slightly. <i>Don\u2019t show\nfear!</i> Caleb wants to cry out, but he cannot, as his master stands\nbehind him. \n</p><p>Instead\nhe grits his teeth and holds on to Eodwulf\u2019s arm, ignites his palm\nand refuses to look away as his dear friend cries out for mercy. The\nsmell of burning skin \u2013 sickeningly familiar, now - begins to fill\nthe room, and Caleb is trembling, but his teacher\u2019s shadow is\nbehind him. A little way further back, he is distantly aware of the\nsound of Astrid\u2019s muffled sobs. \n</p><p>He\ntells himself that he and Eodwulf deserve this. He tells himself it\nwill be over quickly. Tears spill down his face, but he does not turn\nor look away.</p><p>It\nis over, in the end. Afterwards, when they have been judged to have\nlearned their lesson, Master Ikithon sends them away to the healing\npotion store with benevolent mercy.</p><p>They\nall sleep in Astrid\u2019s room that night, curled up on the bed\ntogether, crying until they all have no tears left. \n</p><p>At\nleast until the next time. \n</p><hr><p>They\nare given leave to return home to Blumenthal for visits,\noccasionally. They travel there for Harvest Close, or a little before\n\u2013 they all know that their parents need the extra pairs of hands to\nhelp with the harvest \u2013 or, sometimes, for Winter\u2019s Crest. \n</p><p>This\nis how it is the winter they are sixteen. \n</p><p>(This\nis not the last time they will return, nor the second last. But it is\nthe last that Caleb will be able to remember, from the distance of\nmany years and a broken second life, as truly happy.)</p><p>They\nare at Eodwulf\u2019s parents\u2019 house, and outside the window, snow is\nfalling gently. Their families are all there, as are some of the\nfamilies of the other children they knew, when they really were\nchildren; Caleb shares glances with Astrid and Eodwulf and knows that\nthey are thinking the same thing. How long it\u2019s been, how much\nthey\u2019ve grown beyond this place. The others that they left behind\nare living in a completely different world, and none of the three\nquite know how they should interact with this place they have left\nbehind. \n</p><p>It\u2019s\ncomforting, yes, in the way that home is, all soft colours and\nhalf-remembered voices. It smells like childhood. It\u2019s good to hear\nand speak Zemnian again, but if one more person informs Caleb he\u2019s\npicked up an accent, he mutters to the other two, he has half a mind\nto just up and leave.</p><p>He\ndoesn\u2019t leave, of course. He\u2019s finding himself too at ease for\nthat. The night carries on, as the snow falls softly outside. He\ndoesn\u2019t always feel at ease, talking to people \u2013 apart from his\nfamily, and Eodwulf and Astrid of course \u2013 but here, tonight, he\ndoes. He mingles around the room, but always he is watching them from\nthe corners of his eye. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nis spinning illusions for his little cousins, making even the adults\ngasp and praise his skill. The children are positively delighted,\ntheir small hands grabbing at a flight of miniature birds, seven baby\nrabbits hopping across the floor, a dancer in shimmering silks and\nsatins spinning in the centre of the floor to illusory music. Eodwulf\nstands in the centre of it, smiling in that shy way he has when\npeople compliment him, as though he doesn\u2019t know what to say. \n</p><p>Astrid\nstands a little way off, clapping and cheering for Eodwulf\u2019s\nillusions louder than any of the others. Her eyes catch Caleb\u2019s\nacross the room and she grins, beckoning him over to join in. \n</p><p>And\nof course, he goes.</p><p>Later\nin the evening, food is served \u2013 Eodwulf\u2019s family always makes\nthe best food, but everyone from the village has brought something to\nshare. There is hot, spiced wine, kept hot above a brazier in a brass\nbowl polished carefully to a mirror shine. Caleb knows what\u2019s\ncoming next; he remembers this from his childhood. He wasn\u2019t old\nenough then to be given more than a thimbleful, but he had loved to\nwatch anyway. He still does, smiling as Eodwulf\u2019s mother places a\nlittle wire shelf above the bowl, a loaf of solid sugar on top of it\nwhich she then soaks in rum. An anticipatory hush falls.</p><p>Then\nshe smiles, strikes a match, and sets it alight. \n</p><p>It\nburns orange for a moment, then bright blue, clear flames rippling\nalong the crystalline surface of the sugar. After a moment it begins\nto melt the sugar, dripping down into the wine. Magical fire is also\nblue sometimes, he finds himself thinking. It looks different though;\nit takes an expert to tell, but he knows fire, now. He knows how it\nbehaves, he knows how to create it and control it, the shapes it\nmakes and how it catches and spreads. \n</p><p>He\nrealises he is daydreaming as his mother touches his shoulder, and\nCaleb feels himself start, then smile, as Astrid elbows her way\nthrough the crowd of people filling the small sitting room, placing a\ncup in his hands. \n</p><p>He\nthanks her as he takes it, feeling the warmth glow against his hands.\nHe sips, enjoying the warmth and sweetness, the spirit already\nbeginning to heat his throat. \n</p><p>Astrid\nwanders off the other side of the room as the party resumes again,\nlouder now. But Caleb hangs back slightly. He is thinking about fire;\nit\u2019s true what his teacher says, he thinks, his mind a little warm\nand muzzy with the drink. It\u2019s true that fire can create new\nthings, as much as it can destroy. All this\u2026whatever they do, in\nthat dungeon, it\u2019s all for the sake of the citizens of the Empire,\nfor people like these, leading safe lives like the ones the three of\nthem were raised to. It\u2019s all to protect them from the threat of\nchaos, of the dark that threatens to destroy them. \n</p><p>And\nin this moment it\u2019s absolutely worth it.</p><p>\u201cHaving\na good time, <i>Erdbeerchen</i>?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\nblinks, lifting his eyes from his cup at the sound of the childhood\nnickname; he\u2019s been gazing down into it for a few minutes now, he\nrealises, and not talking to anyone. <i>Right</i>; he remembers that\nwhen he does that, most people interpret it as him not having a good\ntime. \n</p><p>Not\nhis mother though; she knows him too well. She knows that he can\u2019t\nhandle large groups that well, though it\u2019s gotten a little easier\nsince he was a child. He looks up at her and smiles. \u201c<i>Ja,\nMutti</i>.\u201d</p><p>She\nruffles his hair, a scant shade darker red than he own. \u201cGood.\u201d\nShe raises an eyebrow asking for permission and he sighs, nods, lets\nher pull him in for a hug; suddenly he realises that in the time he\u2019s\nbeen away, he\u2019s grown as tall as she is. She pulls away, holding\nhim by the shoulders and inspecting him with an affectionate but\ncritical eye. He expects her to ask him if he\u2019s been using the\nsalve she gave him for his acne last time he was home, or tell him he\nlooks like he hasn\u2019t been sleeping enough, or some other such\nthing. But instead she grins, her eyes flicking off the the corner to\nwhere Astrid and Eodwulf are talking, their heads close together over\ntheir cups\nof wine. <br></p><p>\n\u201cWhich\none of them is it that makes you look at them like that?\u201d his\nmother asks, and Caleb chokes a little, already feeling a blush rise. <br></p><p>\u201cYou three are so inseparable these days, your father and I are\nhaving trouble telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\nno, it\u2019s not like that - \u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh.\u201d\nShe smiles, teasing. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be embarrassed. It\u2019s\nhow it is, at your age, and first love is an excitement\nthat-\u201d\n</p><p>\u201c<i>Mutti</i>\u2026\nno, I mean I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say\u2026ah\u2026l-love\u2026\u201d\nthe word burns with possibility in his mouth, but more than that; it\nfeels strange and ill-fitting for what is between them, even\nreductive. It is a given, isn\u2019t it, that he loves Eodwulf and\nAstrid? They spend each day together, bound by their destiny, sharing\neverything. But he doesn\u2019t think that is the kind of love she\nmeans. He stares determinedly down into his cup, a grown-out lock of\nhair falling over his face. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cCaleb.\n<i>Mein liebling</i>. Look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\nflounders, as she leans forward and tucks the hair behind his ear. It\nis an affectionate gesture, but one that also means he has to meet\nher eye. She is merely looking at him with raised eyebrows. \u201cOnly\nyou can say what you really feel. And that means taking a good hard\nlook at what\u2019s in your heart, and not turning away from it.\u201d She\nsmiles. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen the way you\u2019ve been looking all evening,\nso I think you know already, somewhere in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\nsighs, looking back over at Astrid and Eodwulf. Astrid is telling a\nstory, gesturing with her free hand in the air, the firelight dancing\noff her glasses and golden waves of hair that is loose over her\nshoulder for once, unbraided and catching the light in burnished\ngold. Eodwulf is laughing at what she was saying, his cheeks dimpling\nas he smiles. He takes a sip of wine and the apple of his throat bobs\nup and down.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ntakes a drink too, sure his face is on fire now. He turns back to his\nmother, who is stifling laughter. \u201cSorry\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2026you\ndon\u2019t have to tell me, you know. Not if you don\u2019t want to. Just\nas long as you are being careful and safe\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>M</i><i>utt</i><i>er!</i>\u201d\nhe blurts out, wishing he could sink into the floor, as she pats him\nconsolingly on the arm. He sighs, looking down. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\nboth of them, a bit. But it\u2019s not like that, with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\nnarrows her eyes for a second, and he knows she is reading him,\nseeing that what he says is the truth. She always had placed her\ntrust in him, even as a child. She hums sympathetically, dropping her\nvoice a little for the words she says next. \u201cBut I think\u2026you want\nit to be\u2026or am I wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\ngrimaces, still half wishing to sink through the floor, but also,\nsurprisingly, finding himself glad to have someone to speak about\nthis with. \u201c\u2026Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm\u2026\nthat\u2019s a difficult problem. Have you tried\u2026saying anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>His\neyes widen, slightly appalled. \u201cOh, no! I couldn\u2019t possibly\u2026\u201d\nhe tails off, at her expression. He hesitates, face burning. \u201c<i>Mutti</i>,\njust\u2026say that there was something\u2026\u201d he ignores her triumphant\nsmile, resolute. \u201cSay that there was something\u2026that I wanted to\nsay to someone.\u201d His face burns hotter than fire. \u201cHow would I\neven\u2026\u201d he gestures wildly. \n</p>\n<p>Her\ngentle smile makes him pause, as she takes his hand in hers. \u201cJust\nsay it. I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s no other way.\u201d She sends a look\nover to where the other two stand, still talking in low voices. \u201cBut\nyou know\u2026 I think you\u2019re lucky to have them, and they to have\nyou. You three\u2026\u201d she shook her head, \u201cyou three have a magic\nbetween you, that\u2019s not just the kind you learn in your classes.\nYou\u2019ve always been better together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsmiles to himself, as she ran her thumb over the back of his hand. \u201cI\nknow, <i>Mutti</i>. And\u2026 thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\nhugs him again, and he lets himself smile wider as her hair tickles\nhis face. \u201cAny time, <i>Kr</i><i>\u00fc</i><i>melchen</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Mutt</i><i>er</i>\u2026\nplease <i>s</i>top\nit\u2026 I\u2019m not a baby anymore\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Her\nlaughter is as warm as he always remembered it, mingling with the\ncontented chatter and quiet music of the room. She touches his cheek,\nlooking into his eyes with a proud smile, that is also slightly\nmelancholic; she misses the days of his childhood when he was at home\nwith her, he realises then. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry\u201d she says, cupping his cheek. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><hr><p>He\nthinks about what she\u2019s said with a slightly clearer head on the\njourney back, as the carriage jostles him back and forth. The three\nare bundled up in warm knitted clothes for the journey, and Caleb is\nbeginning to feel very warm. It\u2019s not the many layers though; it\u2019s\nbecause he is sitting squeezed in between the two of them in two\nseats. The other seats are occupied by a large basket of freshly\nbaked bread, almond crescent cookies and gingerbread stars and cakes\nfilled with sweet plum jam. Gifts from their parents, as well as new\nknitted clothes to keep them warm in the winter, and a new fur-lined\ncloak each \u2013 these they are actually wearing, as it\u2019s cold on the\njourney. There is also a wheel of cheese of the kind they remember\nfrom their childhoods in the village, a small cask containing ale,\nmade by Caleb\u2019s father\u2019s cousin, who is the village brewer.\nSeveral clumsy wooden toys whittled by the younger children, just\nlearning their craft. A beautifully embroidered quilt from Eodwulf\u2019s\ngrandmother. A wood flute like Astrid\u2019s uncle used to play on\nsummer nights under the moon. \n</p>\n<p>Simple\ngifts, but they are glad of them. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nand Eodwulf are leaning against both of his shoulders and dozing as\nthey journey back to their master\u2019s house. Astrid\u2019s hair tickles\nhis nose, and Eodwulf\u2019s wool-gloved hand has come to rest on the\nseat, just touching Caleb\u2019s knee.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\nnot new, of course. Or at least, not the closeness of them. Caleb and\nAstrid and Eodwulf have long passed the point in their friendship at\nwhich falling asleep curled together on the soft chairs in their\nlittle common room is ordinary. It is a source of comfort. When their\nmaster punishes them, or on nights when the nightmares come for one\nor the other of them, they will sometimes wordlessly slip into each\nother\u2019s rooms, not even needing to speak as they curl up together.\nThey\u2019re all used to closeness, to the gentle rhythm of each other\u2019s\nsleep breathing, the warm weight of each other pressed close. Them\nagainst the world. They understand this. \n</p>\n<p>Always\nbefore though, Caleb has imagined that this is what having siblings\nis like, but now, suddenly, it feels unimaginably different from\nthat. But to say that his mother\u2019s half-teasing, half insistent\nenquiring, has set him to rethinking that is a vast understatement;\nit has set off a firestorm inside his head, full of dangerous\npossibilities. Making his face heat even to contemplate, but somehow\nimpossible to look away from. \n</p>\n<p>And\ndoesn\u2019t he of all people know the possibilities of fire, doesn\u2019t\nhe know the way it spreads if left to itself?</p>\n<p>Astrid\u2019s\nhead nods against his chest, over his heart, and Caleb feels fire run\nup and down his whole body.</p>\n<p>Resignedly,\nhe raises the fur-lined travel blanket up to tuck around Astrid more\nfully, then hesitates for a moment, then lays his own head down on\ntop of Eodwulf\u2019s, pointedly resisting the sudden and urge to drop a\nkiss right in the center of his hair, where it parts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Verdammt!</i>\u201d\nCaleb mutters to himself, as he closes his eyes in resignation.</p>\n<hr><p>It\nis Eodwulf he kisses first, in the dim light of the lamp one night\nwhen Astrid is at a lesson. It is some months after the conversation with his mother, and he knows the others feel it too, now; the signs are there, or maybe they were all along, if only he had been looking. <br></p><p>It was only a matter of time.<br></p><p>They are sitting together by the fire,\nand silence has fallen; the kind of companionable silence that exists\nwhen people know each other so well that they understand each other\nperfectly without the need for words. Behind them, the fire is a dim\nred glow, and Caleb can see it reflected and dancing in miniature, in\nEodwulf\u2019s dark eyes, turned to molten amber in the firelight that\ncatches there. He feels something hitch in his chest, as they each\nlean forward, warm breath mingling between them as their lips meet.</p>\n<p>They\nare there for some time, kissing in the quiet.</p>\n<p>In\nfact, it is more time than Caleb thinks. Usually, he is able to know\nwhat time it is with perfect accuracy. But time, it seems, is\ndifferent in this situation \u2013 a fact he files away for future\nreference - because Astrid is back from her lesson. \n</p>\n<p>She\nknows immediately. Caleb sees it in her eyes, the small tug of a\nsmile at the corner of her mouth. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\npulls away quicker than Caleb, his face endearingly alarmed. He\ndoesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings. \u201cAstrid! We were just\u2026\u201d he\ntails off vaguely, darting a glance at Caleb. \n</p>\n<p>He\ncan\u2019t help it; he immediately starts laughing, buoyed up by the\ntouch of Eodwulf\u2019s lips he can still feel against his. Astrid\nstarts laughing too, her face splitting into a mischievous grin.\n\u201cWell\u201d she says, \u201cI knew it was going to happen at some point.\u201d\nShe takes Caleb\u2019s hand, then Eodwulf\u2019s, looking endearingly\nvulnerable for a moment. As though asking for permission. Caleb takes\nher hand, holds it fiercely, tightly close, and she smiles again,\ncarrying on. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry you had to start without me.\u201d</p>\n<hr><p>Time\npasses, as time does.</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Master Ikithon are in the dungeons again, down the spiral from\nthe conservatory and into what sometimes seems like another world, in\ncontrast to the bright garden from which they enter that place. It is\neasier, Caleb has found, to think of it so; to separate these trips\nfrom the rest of his life. Some part of him, then, can pretend that\nthe work they do here is not real, that it is not a real person who\nscreams under his touch. \n</p>\n<p>The\nman \u2013 the traitor \u2013 is naked and submerged in water up to his\nneck, a large copper vessel almost like a bathtub. The metal conducts\nheat well; this Caleb knows from his lessons in alchemy. Chains run\nfrom his ankles, wrists and throat to heavy iron brackets on the\nwalls. \n</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon nods at him, and Caleb lays a hand against the copper\nexterior of the bath. \n</p>\n<p>He\nhas long since mastered the technique of heating water with\nexcruciating slowness, but they have been down here for some time\nnow; clouds of steam are beginning to roll off the top of the water,\nrising into the air which is growing hot and humid, though they are\ndeep in the dungeons. Caleb\u2019s face is shiny and dripping with sweat\nfrom the heat, but his hands do not shake as he lays them against the\nmetal. \n</p>\n<p>His\nteacher is watching him, after all. \n</p>\n<p>The\nheat rises, and the man in the bathtub begins to scream. All the\nwhile, Master Ikithon stands behind him with his hands clasped neatly\nbehind his back, asking questions in a voice with no inflection. He\nis thorough; he teases out information, getting into every corner and\nleaving nothing that could be of significance. \n</p>\n<p><i>Who\nwas your leader? When and where did the group meet? Did any of the\nothers get away? What were the plans if it went wrong? Where was your\nhideout? Do any of the other conspirators have families in the city?</i>\nAnd on and on. Caleb is expected to remember this, to take careful\nmental notes. Sometimes, after all, it is him doing the questioning.</p>\n<p>They\nall resist, at first; Caleb has come to know this. They all put up a\nshow of sticking to their treasonous principles. But when they are in\npain, when their minds are cooking within their flesh, then the truth\nspills. It takes control and attention to catch it as it does,\nthrough a semi-conscious haze and screams of agony, but Caleb is\nlearning. \n</p>\n<p>All\nfor the good of the empire, Caleb thinks, feeling a rush of\nsatisfaction as Master Ikithon nods to him approvingly, as he turns\nthe heat in the water up a little more. He is becoming good at\ntelling when they have no more to give, when the end must come. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare not unmerciful, after all. They are not cruel, they only seek the\ntruth, and once it has gone these traitors are mere husks, empty and\nworthless. Yet they still must be punished. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nraises the temperature of the water to boiling, the hiss mingling\nwith the man\u2019s final, exhausted scream. \n</p>\n<hr><p>The\nfollowing summer, Eodwulf almost breaks. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nnever finds out exactly what happened. He and Astrid spend a brief\ntime speculating, but neither quite have the words to speak about it.\n\n</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s\nwhat they know; they know that Eodwulf is growing strong in his\nmagic. They know that Master Ikithon is teaching him to pry open\nminds, to spin illusions to strike fear and then pick their heads\nlike locks and break inside, to better let them spill their secrets\nto him. For the sake of the Empire, of course. Some traitors have\nmuch more to yield if given this treatment. It depends on the person,\nas their teacher says. Everyone has their own way in which they\nbreak. \n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\ndangerous, Caleb knows; such things are not his main area of study,\nbut he knows that Eodwulf has had trouble in the past with not\nletting them into his own mind. From what he knows, for that sort of\nmagic one\u2019s own empathy needs to be both sharpened and blunted all\nat once. This is to allow the connection and the mastery over the\ntarget to be strong and pervasive enough to do what must be done,\nwhile protecting one\u2019s own mind from the strain, or from\nretaliatory attacks. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and a fine line to\nwalk. \n</p>\n<p>They\ndo not know exactly what Eodwulf learns in his private lessons with\ntheir teacher, in the dungeons under the conservatory; it feels\nsafer, somehow, not to know.</p>\n<p>One\ngolden summer day, Caleb and Astrid are sitting in the garden\nreading. Or rather, Caleb is reading, and Astrid has set down her\nbook, is lying down in the grass across Caleb\u2019s lap and idly\nlevitating his wide-brimmed straw hat in the air above his head. It\u2019s\nstill a good sunshade; she keeps it expertly in place, shading his\nface and eyes so that his paler skin does not burn in the noonday\nsun. It\u2019s a companionable silence between them.</p>\n<p>The\nsilence is broken by the slamming open of the door to the\nconservatory, and Caleb frowns, closing his book as Eodwulf appears\nat the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstrid\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She\ndrops the spell, and the hat flops neatly back down over Caleb\u2019s\nhead. He pulls up the brim to exchange a look as she sits up, looking\nover to where Eodwulf is running across the garden back to the house.</p>\n<p>There\nis something in the way he is running; desperation, fear. \n</p>\n<p>They\ncan\u2019t see his face from this distance. But it looks almost as\nthough he\u2019s running away from something. \n</p>\n<hr><p>There\nis punishment, for running away from one\u2019s duties. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nis sitting on the ground, crying soundless tears and biting down hard\nenough on her lip to draw blood. Her glasses are cracked and her eyes\nare blank and staring into nothingness as Eodwulf stands in front of\nher, a trembling hand extended. Master Ikithon\u2019s hand is on his\nshoulder, his face grave. Illusion magic swirls about him, as Eodwulf\nchannels the spell that is making Astrid see horrors dance before her\neyes. Caleb feels a rush of sympathy for them both. The last time\nEodwulf made a mistake, it was Caleb who had to be the subject of his\ncorrective practice. Afterwards, Eodwulf had come to him gushing\napologies, curling up in Caleb\u2019s lap and sobbing. All Caleb had\nbeen able to do was hold him, stroking his hair and telling him that\nreally, he had been all right.</p>\n<p>(He\nhadn\u2019t been all right, actually; he had seen a detailed illusory\nimage of a dragon devouring his family, ripping them limb from limb\nwhile he was held in place and unable to go to them, and it still\nweighed on his mind, though he knew it was not real.)</p>\n<p>Eventually,\nAstrid had joined them, letting a weasel-formed Hieronymus curl\nsinuously around Eodwulf\u2019s neck as he sobbed into Caleb\u2019s\nshoulder. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, it would be different, Caleb knows. The look in Eodwulf\u2019s\neyes is different; something has tipped like a scale inside him. \n</p>\n<p>Suddenly,\nEodwulf is lowering his hand, the magic dissipating like smoke as\nAstrid slumps sideways. Caleb doesn\u2019t even know if she\u2019s\nconscious, and he wants nothing more than to run to her side. But in\nthat moment, he dare not. His eyes are fixed on Eodwulf, who had\nstopped casting his spell, in defiance of Master Ikithon\u2019s orders. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u201d\nEodwulf whispers, almost a question. As though he cannot believe the\nchoice he just made. His eyes are filled with tortured defiance,\ndarting toward their master, then looking back at the ground as\nthough he cannot look anymore. \u201cNo\u201d he says again, eyes filling\nwith tears as he falls to his knees. \u201cNo, no no no\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nis about to reach out to him \u2013 though the look in their master\u2019s\neyes is one of disappointment, and reaching out to Eodwulf suddenly,\nin this moment, feels dangerous, as though fear and weakness is a\ndisease that is contagious \u2013 but before he can, Eodwulf turns, with\none last look at Master Ikithon, and runs from the room. \n</p>\n<p>Their\nmaster does no follow him, merely sighs, deep and disappointed. He\nshakes his head in sorrow, looking over at Astrid \u2013 beginning to\nlever herself up off the floor, wiping her tear-stained face roughly\nwith her sleeve \u2013 and Caleb, shuffling over to be at least by her\nside. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cClass\ndismissed,\u201d says their master, his voice heavy with regret, and\nsweeps from the room, leaving behind a sense that whatever had\nhappened here today is not over.  \n</p>\n<hr><p>When\nCaleb and Astrid return to their little common room, Eodwulf is not\nthere. They knock on his bedroom door. He has barricaded it shut \u2013\nwith a chair under the handle rather than magic - and only relents\nwhen they threaten to blast it open. At this he opens the door only a\ncrack, one dark eye appears in the gap and looking at the two of\nthem, reproachful. \u201c<i>Was?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Astrid\nplaces her hands on her hips, standing square in the doorway. She\nanswers deliberately in Common, voice accustory.  \u201cWhy did you\nstop?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nopens the door a little more, and Caleb can see the droop of his\nshoulders. \u201cBecause\u2026because I was hurting you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Idiot</i><i>!</i>\u201d\nshe snaps. Anyone else might think that she is angry, but Caleb knows\nthe truth. It is always fear that makes Astrid sharp as glass. Fear\nfor Eodwulf though; it\u2019s always for one of the two of them, never\nfor herself. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d she gestures with a\nhand in the air, agitated. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2026<i>not</i> do it!\nYou can\u2019t refuse him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nhangs his head, looking away from her sullenly, not defending\nhimself. \n</p>\n<p>This\nonly seems to make things worse. In her anger, she summons\nHieronymus with a click of her fingers. He appears around her throat\nin the form of a snake, hissing along with her words. \u201cIf you\u2026if\nyou can\u2019t do something so simple, to someone you\u2026\u201d Astrid\nbreaks off, biting her lip. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have the strength it\ntakes. It\u2019s fucking <i>selfish</i> to stop because of me, when you\n<i>know</i> I\u2019m stronger than that!\u201d She\u2019s glaring at him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d She takes a deep breath, looking\nat Caleb for support. He lays a slightly trembling hand on her arm.\n\u201cAnd we can get through it together, and at the end we\u2019ll all be\ndefending the Empire together. But\u2026\u201d her fingers clench in the\nsleeve of her shirt, ruching the fabric. \u201cBut we can\u2019t just stop\nnow. We\u2019ve come too far. We have to keep going! <i>Stay on this\npath and don\u2019t turn aside</i>\u2026remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy\nfor you to say\u201d counters Eodwulf, voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\nI\u2019m not strong like you. And I\u2019m not smart like Caleb\u2026\u201d he\nsighs, running fingers through his hair, stopping Caleb\u2019s protest\nwith a raised hand. \u201cI\u2026 sometimes\u2026\u201d he meets Astrid\u2019s\nglare, desperate, eyes filled with panic suddenly. \u201cSometimes, I\ndon\u2019t know if I can do this, <i>mein</i><i>e</i><i> S</i><i style=\"background-color: transparent;\">onnenblume</i>\u2026\u201d\nEodwulf looks to Caleb for help as Astrid winces, crossing her arms\nover her chest and turning away. \n</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Nein!</i>\nStop it! You <i>don\u2019t</i> get to say you can\u2019t do it. Not now,\nnot ever!\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, squeezing Astrid\u2019s arm in a wordless gesture of comfort,\nmeeting Eodwulf\u2019s eyes at the same time. He reaches out to take his\nhand, but Eodwulf twitches away, so Caleb drops his hand awkwardly at\nhis side. \u201cShe\u2019s right, though. If Master Ikithon sent you away\nfrom here\u2026\u201d he lets the sentence hang in the air, as they all\nimagine it. It was always supposed to be the three of them, after\nall; they wouldn\u2019t know what to do, how to be, with just two. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nsighs. \u201cHe\u2026he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d But Caleb can hear the uncertainty\nin his voice. Eodwulf wrings his hands, looking between the two of\nthem. He seems to only half be looking at their faces. \u201cNot for\nthis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, stepping up and putting an arm around Astrid, whose hands are\nballed in fists at her sides, her shoulders tense. \u201cEodwulf - \u201d</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can say more, there\u2019s a knock at the door. They all\nstart; it is a vanishingly rare occurrence that their teacher should\ncome to visit them after hours, unless in the case of a momentous\nastronomical even that he would have them witness. Yet still, they\nall know the sound of his knock, even the sound of his footsteps in\nthe hall. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, Eodwulf flinches violently at the sound, begins scrubbing at\nhis teary eyes with a sleeve with desperate haste.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ngets up to open it. Their teacher is there, but he doesn\u2019t look\nangry. He almost never does \u2013 only disappointed. Now, though, he\nseems to have easily slipped back into the mild-mannered, slightly\nindulgent smile, though it is a little aggrieved looking. \n</p>\n<p>He\nregrets having to punish them; he always tells them so. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\nCaleb. May I see Eodwulf, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nblinks a little, nodding quickly, and already Eodwulf is there beside\nhim, and only Caleb is close enough to see the stiffness in his\nmuscles, fear and panic written in every line of his body. \n</p>\n<hr><p>The\nnext day Caleb stands in resolute stillness beside Astrid, both\ndrawing as much comfort as they can afford to allow themselves from\nthe closeness between them. It is just the two of them, and the\nsilence hangs over the whole house, heavy and oppressive. Neither of\nthem can concentrate on any work. \n</p>\n<p>He\nknows, at least, what Astrid is thinking, as she lets Hieronymus\ntwine about her fingers, quickly enough to indicate that she is\nnervous. She could send him to spy, but she does not, and Caleb\ndoesn\u2019t ask her to. \n</p>\n<p>He\nunderstands, because he is thinking the same thing, as they watch the\ndoor to their little sitting room, cautious glances cast from beneath\ntheir lashes. They are waiting for it to open, yet it does not, all\nday.</p>\n<p><i>That\nwill never be me</i>, Caleb thinks. <i>I will become stronger, so\nthat I never have to displease Master Ikithon so. I will not break,\nnot for anything. I must be made of steel and stone.</i></p>\n<p>At\nnight, Caleb and Astrid cling together in Astrid\u2019s bed, without any\nwords. No words are necessary; only the comfort that they can give\neach other, just by being close. They curl up together, and Caleb\nfalls asleep with his face pressed into the hollow of Astrid\u2019s\nthroat, her chin resting on the crown of his head.</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nis back the next day, quieter than usual but otherwise the same.</p>\n<p>Or\nnot quite the same; they do not speak of it, but there is something\ndifferent about him. Caleb can\u2019t quite place it at first, until he\ncan; the look in Eodwulf\u2019s eyes is different, after whatever\npunishment Master Ikithon dealt out. Eodwulf looks far away, his eyes\nnot quite making contact as they used to. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nnotices it immediately too. The two of them do not speak about their\nargument the day before; somehow, such a discussion seems reduntant,\nnow. \n</p>\n<p>And\nEodwulf is different in other ways, after that. More withdrawn,\nslower to show his emotions and slower to cry, either with joy or\nsorrow. They\u2019ve all changed, over the years, but this is the time\nthat Caleb and Astrid see it most clearly. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare happy for him, they tell themselves. Eodwulf is stronger now, and\nhe will not make the same mistake again. This, they can see in his\neyes more than anything, eyes that tell a little less now. Eyes that\nare a little darker, a little blanker, but not so quick to betray\nhim. More driven and hungry, more steel behind the softness.</p>\n<p>Caleb\u2019s\nmind slips away from the shadows under those eyes, slightly deeper\nthan before. He\u2019s almost jealous. Eodwulf also seems to have mended\nfences with Master Ikithon; though of course, their teacher was\nalways the sort who would forgive them in the end. They are his\nshining stars, after all, the bright future of the Empire.</p>\n<p><i>Just\nas long as they stay on the path, and do not turn aside.</i></p>\n<hr><p>Eodwulf\ncuts his hair short, that year. It has always been long, not as long\nas Astrid\u2019s golden braid \u2013 which she has taken to looping around\nher head and pinning into a neat little crown with pins that seem to\nturn up everywhere, even amongst Caleb\u2019s spell components and\nwriting materials \u2013 but long enough to hang in soft, inky ringlets\nto about his shoulders. With short hair, Eodwulf looks so different\nthat for a brief moment Caleb doesn\u2019t recognise him. But then there\nis Astrid\u2019s gasp, running over to Eodwulf and immediately carding\nher fingers through his short hair, and Caleb is smiling too, telling\nhim that it looks better now. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn\u2019t know if he actually thinks that; it makes Eodwulf look\nolder, and certainly more attractive. You can see his face fully now,\nwhereas before his eyes would often be half-covered by a fall of\nhair. And the part of Caleb that makes his heart flutter whenever he\nwatches Eodwulf\u2019s hands at work, that melts into his arms when\ntheir lips meet in a passionate kiss\u2026that part of him is all for\nit. But there\u2019s another part, a part that loved the feeling of\nrunning his fingers through thick dark locks, a part that remembered\nhow much a younger Eodwulf had taken pride in his long hair, and\nwondered if the loss of the sweet and shy child who had been one of\nhis two best friends long before they had ever become lovers was\nworth the price. It\u2019s not just hair, after all; something else has\nchanged, something that goes bone-deep. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn\u2019t say this though; instead he promises to lend Eodwulf the\nhair pomade that his father gave him, the very moment he learned that\nCaleb would be mixing with the nobles in the city. The smell reminds\nCaleb powerfully of his childhood; his father would comb the stuff\nthrough Caleb\u2019s hair to tame his wild ginger mop, for special\noccasions; births, marriages, funerals, festivals of all sorts. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\naccepts it with a smile and a nod, but his eyes betray nothing. \n</p>\n<hr><p>They\nhave certain unspoken agreements, the three of them; truths that they\nnever quite decided outright, boundaries that they do not cross,\nwithout being quite able to say why. \n</p>\n<p>One\nof these is that they rarely speak to each other of what goes on in\ntheir private lessons with their master. For rhe ones that take place\nin the dungeons below the conservatory, this goes double. And those\nlessons are becoming more and more frequent; Master Ikithon must know\nthat they all have the strength to be able to do what must be done,\nthinks Caleb with a slight glow of pride.</p>\n<p>Today\nis one of the exceptions, and Astrid is the reason for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\nso, once I had asked that question, Master Ikithon seemed terribly\npleased that I\u2019d apparently hit the nail on the head of a whole\narea of scholarship\u2026did you know that there are many philosophers\nof magic over the years who have done experiments on whether the\nundead can feel pain?\u201d Astrid is prestidigitating the blood and\nviscera off her over-tunic, as the others watch. One spell isn\u2019t\nenough to get it clean, so she\u2019s doing it repeatedly, telling Caleb\nand Eodwulf about her most recent lesson as she works. \u201cAnd he\nseemed excited that my questions had gone to that place - \u201d she\nsmiles proudly \u201c - and loaned me several books\u2026\u201d she waves a\nbloody hand over at the large stack of books on the floor beside her.\n\n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf exchange a look of recognition, and pride; they\nunderstand why Astrid is so animated, after all. They all live for\nthe feeling of their teacher telling them that their thinking on a\nparticular topic is sound. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\nI take it it became a practical lesson?\u201d Caleb asks, raising an\neyebrow. When one of them begins a philosophical discussion, their\nmaster is always the first to encourage them to test their findings,\nand learn more.</p>\n<p>Astrid\nfreezes, then nods slowly. \u201cIt did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nand Caleb exchange another look. \u201c\u2026And?\u201d</p>\n<p>Astrid\nswallows, pressing her lips together for a moment, before looking up\nat them. \u201cAll experiments show that the undead do feel pain. The\nmanner and degree seems to depend very much on how recently death\noccurred, type of undead, the level of the spell used to resurrect\nthem, the strength and character of the mage who casts it. But\u2026yes\u201d\nshe says. She hesitates a little longer. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s the\nproblem that if they die, the information we want dies with them\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf nod. They\u2019ve experienced this before; their master is\nalways most displeased when they kill a traitor too early, before all\nthe information they contain has been wrung from them. It\u2019s a\ndelicate process. \n</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026But\ntheoretically at least, one could bring them back an unlimited number\nof times. Now, getting information out is not a trivial problem\neither, as resurrection does not always leave the mind and memories\nintact\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u201d\nsays Caleb, nodding. \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\nit\u2019s something that Master Ikithon said is an area ripe for future\nexperimentation. Maybe if we collect enough data, I will even be\nallowed to make a presentation of my findings before the next sitting\nof the Cerberus Assembly!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAstrid,\nthat is wonderful.\u201d Eodwulf raises an eyebrow, eyes fixed on her\nface. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\ncongratulations!\u201d Caleb grins, then falters, when he sees Eodwulf\nlooking at Astrid strangely.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre\u2026are\nyou all right?\u201d he asks; it is true, she is not looking quite as\nhappy about about the prospect as perhaps she should be. \n</p>\n<p>He\nwonders what is going through her mind, but restrains himself from\ncasting a simple Detect Thoughts to try to find out. He thinks he can\nguess some of it, anyway.</p>\n<p>She\nlooks up at him, and Caleb sees something run between the two of\nthem, some calculation that he is not quite a party too, but thinks\nhe understands at least partially too. \u201cYes\u201d Astrid says, going\nback to her bloody tunic, with a determined smile. \u201cYes, I am\nfine.\u201d</p>\n<hr><p>Master\nIkithon brings them to Rexxentrum with him, sometimes. Truly to the\ncity in a beautiful coach with horses, rather than just through the\nportal to the dungeons. \n</p>\n<p>(That\nis, after all, a different world.) \n</p>\n<p>He\nwants to show them off, this best and brightest, and the knowledge\nmakes Caleb\u2019s heart flutter with troublesome nerves. Caleb squashes\nthem resolutely; this is too important to allow his fear to get in\nthe way.</p>\n<p>Getting\ndressed for the occasion helps. They wear stiff formal uniforms for\nofficial visits, imperial black and gold with red trim, buttoned up\nto the neck and tied with heavy and complex sashes and pinned with a\nbeautiful golden brooch that is probably worth more than several\nyears\u2019 worth of his parents\u2019 wages on its own, he thinks. Things\nlike this occur to him sometimes; it\u2019s always a strangely\ndisorientating moment, when they do. \n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\nall right, though; when he\u2019s a real mage working for the Empire,\nwith a position of his own, then he\u2019ll be able to send them all the\nmoney they could ever want. \n</p>\n<p>He\nlikes that thought.</p>\n<hr><p>They\ndance, sometimes. Caleb is not good at it \u2013 easily the worst of the\nthree \u2013 but he is getting better. Astrid is a good dancer; she has\nloved it since she was a child, twirling in a yellow dress at Harvest\nClose in Blumenthal. But now she has learned refinement, quickly\npicking up the steps to dances that the nobles of Rexxentrum favour. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nwas always timid, before, but he is learning to dance too. Since the\ntime he almost broke, he has been less afraid, less conflicted. More\npoised, appearing older even though he is the youngest of the three. \n</p>\n<p>Now,\nEodwulf and Caleb sit on the side of the hall, sipping a fizzy, astringent green drink from crystal flutes. They watch Astrid polka\nacross the floor with a beautiful orange tiefling arcanist dressed\nall in flowing white silks. \n</p>\n<p>The\ntwo dance together after a little while, spinning slowly across the\nfloor. Then Caleb dances with Astrid, a little pink-cheeked from the\ndrink and from dancing every dance. She bows to him with an\nexaggerated flourish before going over to Eodwulf and taking his hand\nin hers. \n</p>\n<p>All\nthis makes Caleb feel almost strong enough to socialise a little, as\nthey are supposed to. He knows that the author of a treatise on\nmagical metallurgy and mining techniques that he found so fascinating\nlast year is here, and Caleb has been working up courage to go and\nspeak to him all evening. \n</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can do so, Master Ikithon catches his arm. He looks up,\nsurprised; his master has been deep in conversation with Oremid Hass,\nas well as several other dignitaries whose names Caleb doesn\u2019t\nknow, their faces graver than usual. Something is preparing, maybe.\nAnd so, he is grateful and proud that his master has a moment to\nspare for him.</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon comes close, conspiratorial. \u201cAh, Caleb. Enjoying the\nevening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\nvery much.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\ngives Caleb a long, calculating look, then nods, patting him on the\nshoulder approvingly, steering him towards the group of dignitaries\nin the corner. \u201cGood. Now, go and do what you\u2019re here for\u2026you\nwon\u2019t be a student forever, and the world must know your face. Do\nnot disappoint me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse not!\u201d \n</p>\n<p>And\nin that moment, he resolves to keep that promise as much as he can,\nwith everything he has to give.</p>\n<hr><p>Their\nmaster has been away a lot recently; there is trouble in the capital,\nrumours of traitors high up within the Cerberus Assembly. Rogue\nmages, making off with important state secrets. Caleb and the others\ndon\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but their master seems troubled. Not\nthat they have much time to wonder, as their workload is increasing.</p>\n<p>Even\nwhile he is away on business to Rexxentrum though, Master Ikithon\nwill meet them in the dungeons under the city; he has taught them to\nopen the portal under the conservatory themselves, a great honour and\na great weight of responsibility. They are undertaking more and more\nof the interrogations on their own, too. \n</p>\n<p>It\nbecomes almost routine, even a welcome respite from the rest of their\nwork.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon; they are all nervous, and tensions run high.\nAstrid and Eodwulf fight over nothing, and do not speak for a week,\nand Caleb is miserable and frustrated the whole time acting as their\nintermediary. They make up in tears, a little later, and it is a\nrelief, but the pressure remains. Astrid takes to constantly\nreorganising her collection of poisons, the little bottles\nmeticulously labeled and cataloged. Eodwulf paces their sitting\nroom in front of the fire, eyes half closed, lips moving slightly as\nhe runs through spells in his mind. Caleb finds himself writing\neverything down, even more so than before; it helps him to organise\nhis thoughts, but his room is awash with paper, stacks and piles of\nit, going through pots of ink and pens at an alarming rate.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon, their master says; sooner than they expected,\nbut their master needs them to reach their full potential sooner\nrather than later. He needs to have them trained soon, so that they\ncan aid him at his side, fully within his trust. \n</p>\n<p>No\nlonger students, but full members of the highest circle of mages in\nthe Empire. \n</p>\n<p>The\nprospect is both unnerving and exhilarating. Caleb thinks about how\nproud his parents will be, and it only makes him push himself harder.</p>\n<p>And\nso they study, and study more, and practice and prepare themselves.\nThere will be a final test of their abilities, they all know. Their\nmaster has not told them what it is yet, but they throw all of their\nstrength and academic abilities into preparing, into becoming\nstronger and cleverer. Caleb goes to bed each night exhausted, his\nmind thrumming with spells and lists and facts and incantations, and\nsometimes the screams of the traitors in the dungeons. Sometimes\nEodwulf or Astrid are with him, pressed close in the dark, or falling\nasleep over their work in front of the fireplace.</p>\n<p>And\nthen, one day, their master comes to them with an announcement. They\nlook at each other with trepidation in their eyes; could this be it?</p>\n<p>But\nno; Master Ikithon surprises them with the gift of some time off. He\ntells them he is giving them two weeks to return to Blumenthal and\ntheir families, once more before they graduate and assume positions\nin Rexxentrum. \n</p>\n<p>He\ntells them to enjoy the time, as afterwards their lives will change\nentirely. \n</p>\n<p>(Caleb\ndoesn\u2019t understand until later how true that statement is.)</p>\n<p>Before\nthey go, he wishes them each farewell with his strange blessing, one\nlast time. Master Ikithon\u2019s fingers feel warm against Caleb\u2019s\ntemple under the lightest of touches. The words sound familiar, an\necho of the years they have spent, of all the work and all of\nthemselves that they have given. A binding of their hearts to his\nmind, the three of them trusting their teacher implicitly. \u201cStay\non this path and don\u2019t turn aside, and it will take you far.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\nhold hands, all three in a row, as they begin their journey home.</p></p>",

They are just children, at the beginning.</p><p>At\nthe end, they are something else entirely. \n</p>[[MORE]]<p>They\nare eleven years old and they are friends already, even before they\nare accepted into the Academy. Even before they meet the man who will\nsee something special in them, pluck them from amongst its ranks of\nbrilliance, of students who hold promise. \n</p><p>The\nnight they find out they will all be going together, Eodwulf and\nCaleb sneak out of their homes, climbing the tree in Astrid\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s garden. There is a rickety little treehouse up there, and\nthe three of them sit and look at the stars until the dawn comes.\nIt\u2019s summer, and it\u2019s warm even in these cool northern latitudes,\nand the night is fragrant and bright with possibility.</p><p>After\nall, everything they could have possibly wanted and more is before\nthem; they need only reach out and take it.</p><hr><p>Blumenthal\nhas never had three of its children honoured so; they throw a\nfestival for them in the village square, a sent-off party one long\nnight near the end of summer. They all wear their best. Someone has\ngiven Eodwulf a crown of pink flowers. It suits him; he has dark skin\nand black hair, and the colour looks good against it, Caleb thinks.\nThe crown\u2019s a little too big and falls down over one eye as he\ngrins shyly at the others. Someone grabs Astrid\u2019s arm and puts one\non her too. It\u2019s yellow, matching her golden-brown skin, her mane\nof hair the colour of old, dusty gold woven into a long braid. She\npushes her thick, wire-rimmed glasses up her nose and squares her\nshoulders in determination, as though she is carrying the full weight\nand responsibility of a true crown. \n</p><p>Caleb\nhas a crown too; his is blue as the summer sky, and the pollen and\nthe scent makes him sneeze a little as a few petals fall down over\nhis face.</p><p>He\nwears it all evening, taking it off at night and laying it on his\nbedside table when he goes to sleep in his own bed for the last time.\nHe will return to Blumenthal, he knows this. But he\u2019s not sure that\nit will ever feel like home anymore, with the bright future stretched\nout before him, the path just waiting for him to walk down it.</p><hr><p>They\nhave been at the academy for a few years when they are told that they\nhave been chosen to be taught privately by Master Trent Ikithon.\nThey\u2019ve actually heard of him before; whispers abound, he\u2019s one\nof the greatest arcanists in the whole Empire, he\u2019s uniquely\ncommitted to both the defence of the realm and the training of the\nmost talented young mages, the best and brightest. He\u2019s tough, it\u2019s\nrumoured; he will not take anything other than the very best, and he\nwill punish failure harshly. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nEodwulf and Astrid cannot stop grinning, as they pack up their few\npossessions for the journey. They know, after all, that if they are\ntogether then they are three times as strong, three times as clever\nand talented. \n</p><p>The\nfact that all of them were chosen is proof enough of that.</p><hr><p>They\neach have their own strengths, and they must find them and train\nthem; that is Master Ikithon\u2019s very first lesson. \n</p><p>After\nhe takes them into his tutelage, the first two weeks are spent\nassessing their individual abilities. He has their files and progress\nreports from the Academy, of course, the records of the scholarships\nthey were each awarded, letters of recommendation, signed and sealed.\nHe barely touches the files; just as he picked them out, he tells\nthem he prefers to use his own experience with such things, to see\nwith his own eyes. They should too, he says; doing so will make it\neasier for them to bring out their full magical potential. \n</p><p>(They\nall have so much potential; it\u2019s something all three of them have\nknown for years now, but somehow when Master Ikithon says it it holds\nall the more promise. It makes them want to prove him right, to show\nhim what they are, and what they can be.)</p><p>They\nwill each complete their full, comprehensive education in history,\nreligion, a variety of languages both common and rare, mathematics,\nrhetoric, politics, natural philosophy, and of course magic. But in\nthis last, they must choose the areas they want to specialise in. \n</p><p>Most\nmages, Master Ikithon tells them, wait until later on in their\neducation to choose a school of magic to specialise in. <i>But you\nthree</i>, he says, smiling at them, <i>are not most mages</i>. They\nare the very brightest young minds in the Empire, and his course of\nstudy will be duly accelerated and advanced. And so they will each\npick a school of magic \u2013 or two if they choose, as ambition is to\nbe encouraged - to study, according to their strengths and their\ninterests once they discover them. They will have to work hard, he\nwarns them; they are not here for an easy few years. But if they\napply themselves then they will rise amongst the ranks of the\nAcademy, then go on to defend the Empire, and who knows to what\nheights they will ascend? \n</p><p>It\nis what they all want, more than anything. \n</p><p>And\nso, their new master spends some time assessing them. Already it is\nhard, demanding work. He has them show him to spells they already\nknow, subjects them to written tests and interviews them at length\nabout their interests, their hopes and dreams and aspirations. \n</p><p>Eventually,\nthe specialisations are chosen. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nwill study the school of illusion magic, with a secondary focus on\nenchantment. The two can be much greater than the sum of their parts\nwhen used together, their master tells Eodwulf, as he reports it back\nto Caleb and Astrid. It is no small thing to be able to look at a\nperson and enchant them so that they spill out the secret they keep\nlocked deep in their heart, especially if the knowledge can then be\nused to spin them an illusion that can either heal or break them. It\nis hard, on a personal level; this much, Master Ikithon acknowledges.\nBut he believes that Eodwulf can handle it, given proper guidance. \n</p><p>When\nEodwulf tells him this, Caleb agrees, and is happy for him; Eodwulf\nwas always the most empathetic of them, a sensitive and intensely\ncreative child. There is a small, hopeful spark in Eodwulf\u2019s eyes,\nand Caleb is happy for his friend.</p><p>(Caleb\nremembers the older boys who would hurt Eodwulf as a child, would\ntake turns trying to make him cry just because it was easy, because\nthey could. Eodwulf had always hated being so beholden to them, and\nCaleb supposes this is his way of fighting back, many years too\nlate.)</p><p>Astrid\ncomes and tells them that she has chosen to study necromancy, with\nconjuration. Caleb is surprised for a moment, until he thinks about\nit a little more, and then he\u2019s not. Master Ikithon, she explains,\nallowed her a little more choice in what she wanted to study. He had\njudged her the most resilient and hardworking of the three, stable of\nmind and always meticulous. Too many who have had the power to\ncontrol others, to bend the powers of life and death to their will,\nhave fallen off the righteous path, he tells Astrid. But that only\nmakes mages who can control these forces all the more valuable to the\nEmpire, and with her level-headed calm and emotional toughness, he\nbelieves that she is able to handle it. Conjuration, too, takes a\nsteadier hand and an even temperament to get right. \n</p><p>(Caleb\nwonders if Master Ikithon looked deeply enough into all their pasts\nto be aware that Astrid\u2019s brother died the winter he was four and\nshe was nine. She had nearly died too, but she had held on long\nenough by days for the snow to melt and the way to be clear for the\nmedicine to come from the capital to cure her. Since then, she has\nboth feared and been fascinated by death beyond anything else. Caleb\nwonders if this was behind her choice. He does not tell Master\nIkithon this; it\u2019s not his to tell, and he is not asked. He\nsupposes it is likely he knows anyway, though.)</p><p>Caleb\nis called last; he will be specialising jointly in transmutation and\nevocation. A true joint specialisation is a difficult task, not for\nthe complacent. Master Ikithon tells him that he is proud of him, and\nCaleb feels his face glow bright with satisfaction; compliments, from\ntheir master, are rare and precious. \n</p><p>But\nCaleb, his master says, has not only the strongest academic record\nbut also the most raw arcane power underneath it. Transmutation \u2013\nhis own particular area of expertise, no less \u2013 is a natural fit\nfor the academically gifted, as it requires a great deal of knowledge\nof substances, the non-magical basis of chemistry, of alchemy and the\ncomposition of things as they occur naturally in order to understand\nthe fundamental laws that govern the changing of one thing into\nanother. And Caleb will be learning the rigourous first principles;\nMaster Ikithon does not believe in a superficial approach to magical\neducation, and with transmutation in particular a solid grounding is\nvital. \n</p><p>And\nthen he will learn evocation. Here, there comes a warning. Many\npeople think, his teacher tells him, that evocation is all raw,\nuntamed power, righteous fire and destruction. But it is also one of\nthe most dangerous schools of magic for the caster; a good grasp of evocation magic\nis far more about learning control and mastery, lest the power the\nmage wields consume them. Fire, in the right hands, he tells Caleb,\nis as much a creative force as a destructive one.</p><p>He\ntells Caleb that if anyone can wield that power, it is him.</p><p>At\nthe time, Caleb glows with ecstatic joy, and immediately throws\nhimself into his studies.</p><hr><p>(It\ndoes not occur to Caleb until many, many years later that it was\nperhaps no coincidence that none of them were chosen to study\ndivination or abjuration. Seeing through illusions to the truth of\nthings, and evading and defending against magical attacks\u2026 at the\ntime, Caleb though what the others thought, that this was far less\nexciting for a young mage who was set to go far than magic that could\nbe used to attack. Besides, he didn\u2019t think that it was any of\ntheir strengths, and surely he could trust his teacher to be able to\nsee the truth of that from the beginning.)</p><p>(It\nonly strikes him so many years later, but he is a different person by\nthen, a whole new life of broken, jagged pieces replacing the shining\nbright one that he had imagined.)</p><hr><p>They\ncome to think of their master\u2019s house as home. The house is a\nbeautiful one, out in the country, away from the bustle and\npoliticking of Rexxentrum. The mountains march far off in the\ndistance, but the house itself is in a sheltered, green valley, a\nlittle warmer and more sundrenched than the city of marble and metal\nand slate, however grand and elegant it may be to Caleb\u2019s eyes. \n</p><p>Caleb\nloves everything about the valley and their master\u2019s house there.\nHe loves the way that the grass ripples and waves in the wind as they\ncome down the mountain road from the pass in their coach, and he\nloves the pear trees that grow in the sheltered garden. He loves the\nlibrary above all; being surrounded by so many books is a blessing he\nhasn\u2019t yet come to take for granted and probably never will.\nThere\u2019s so many of them, three levels with beautifully carved and\ndark-polished rolling ladders so he doesn\u2019t need to ask anyone if\nhe wants the highest ones. If he\u2019s got no other work to do, he can\njust sit there and read all day, in the reading room where the sun\nfilters down in stripes through the half-shuttered windows with their\ncomfortably-upholstered alcoves. If he wants, he can sit in a window\nseat curled up with a book for hours, and no one will tell him to go\nand do his chores instead because this is his <i>life</i> now, it\u2019s\nall part of his studies and besides, his master is rich enough to\nhave household servants who go about on quiet feet. There\u2019s also a\nwhole walk-in store cupboard of common spell components, which he can\njust take anything from; more dangerous or valuable components are\nkept personally by Master Ikithon, but Caleb knows he only has to ask\nfor it and tell his master why he needs it, and it will be his. \n</p><p>He\nloves that he and Eodwulf and Astrid have rooms next to each other,\nall three in a row. Their rooms open onto a little common sitting\nroom, with a cozy fireplace that they share. In the evenings, after\ndining with their master when he is there, or alone when he is away\non business in Rexxentrum or Zadash, they usually go back there and\ncurl up together on one of the soft chairs. Sometimes, they speak\nabout magic, and their studies, one or other of them showing the\nothers a new spell they\u2019ve learned with pride, or working through\nsomething they\u2019ve been finding difficult to master. Sometimes,\nthough, they just talk, their faces lit by the warm light of the\nfire. They grow close; they were close before of course, Blumenthal\nwas a small village and they\u2019ve all known each other for most of\ntheir lives, have seen each other grow up. But now, they grow closer\nthan they had ever thought possible, sharing their hopes and dreams\nfor the bright future they are bound for. \n</p><p>They\nare all homesick, from time to time. But none of them speak of it;\nthey don\u2019t need to, and besides, even to give voice to such a\nthought would feel wrong, ungrateful. \n</p><p>Besides,\nthey have each other, and as long as the three are together then to\nwhatever greatness they come, they will each always have that little\npiece of their history, reminding them where they came from.</p><p>It\ndoes not occur to any of them that there might come a time when the\nthree of them will not be together. It seems unthinkable, then.</p><hr><p>As\nwell as the lessons that Master Ikithon teaches them all together \u2013\ntheir general studies, and the magical theory and basic spells that\nevery mage should know \u2013 they each have private lessons, once a\nweek for two hours. These sessions take place in Master Ikithon\u2019s\nbrightly lit study, with its wide windows looking out onto the\ngarden, books and wood panelling covering the other three walls.\nCaleb loves these lessons; he sits in a chair at the other side of\nMaster Ikithon\u2019s desk, and his teacher asks him about what he has\nbeen learning that week. The three students spend a lot of time\nreading alone, and it is wonderful to be able to talk about what he\nreads, to ask questions of someone who actually knows the answers. As\na child, Caleb would read every book he could get his hands on, but\nno one in Blumenthal ever had the time or the knowledge for a proper\ndiscussion.</p><p>His\nteacher does. He sits calmly on the other side of his desk, sometimes\nasking a question that is designed to puzzle, to challenge;\nsometimes, Caleb can\u2019t answer them, but that only makes him more\ndetermined to find the answer by the next time. He is meticulous, he\nlikes to get them right; if he makes mistakes, Master Ikithon gets a\nlook of disappointment, a frown line deepening between his eyes,\nwhich grow a little colder. He is the sort of person that makes one\nfeel they must not disappoint.</p><p>After\ntheir discussion, they usually practice some magic; Caleb is learning\nspells as fast as he can, his fingers perpetually stained with ink\nfrom copying them down into one of his many notebooks. He always\nfeels a flicker of nervousness before showing them off though; Master\nIkithon is strong, stronger than any mage in the whole Empire, maybe.\n\n</p><p>He\ndoes not stand for failure in this, either. Magic, Master Ikithon\nsays, when used in the real world, can easily strike down the caster\nif handled incorrectly. It is not a toy but a tool, a weapon, and\nmust be treated as such. \n</p><p>Clumsiness\nand carelessness are thus punished severely. \n</p><p>Caleb\nlets a fireball slip from his control one summer morning as the light\nstreams in the window. It begins to disappate in the air, arcane fire\nsending distortions crackling upwards into the sunlit air above, and\nhe panics, sliding on the carpet to try to grasp the fire again, to\ncatch it back in his fist like a trapped bird. But instead of bending\nto his will, the fire slips from his grasp once more, flaring bright\nbefore vanishing to nothing. \n</p><p>A\nfew papers drift off Master Ikithon\u2019s desk in the downdraft, a\nlittle singed at one edge. They glow but do not catch. Nevertheless\nthey are a little blackened by the time they reach the carpet. \n</p><p>Caleb\nstares at them, his eyes wide as he looks up to meet his master\u2019s;\nsure enough, there is that disappointed look, that slight tightening\nof the mouth, and Caleb\u2019s feels as though his heart were tearing in\ntwo. \n</p><p>There\nare punishments, on days like this. \n</p><hr><p>Caleb\nis back in their common room, laying a rag soaked in a healing potion\non the deep gouges on his upper arm; arcane blades bite deeper than\nthe regular kind, and the pain takes longer to subside. Still, he can\ntake it. As his master says, he is strong, stronger than the others.\nHe deserved this; he\u2019s learned from it. \n</p><p>He\nclenches his fist experimentally, the pain running up his whole\nlacerated arm. The healing potion must be doing its work. When the\ncuts were fresh, he would have been screaming just trying to move his\nfingers, with the tear and burn of ruined skin, gashes deep enough to\ncatch the tendons in his wrist.</p><p>Caleb\ntakes a new rag, dips it in the potion and applies it to his skin. It\nis soothing and tingles a little. \n</p><p>There\nis a store room just for healing potions; they go through many, many\nof them. Their master will be angry with them, after all, if they\nallow his punishments to leave a scar, and so only magical healing\nwill do. After all, to scar them is not his goal. His punishments, he\ntakes pains to tell them, are for the purposes of teaching only. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon is not an inhumane person, after all. He is too indulgent to\nhis students, some at the Academy may even say.</p><p>Caleb\nsighs, looking over at the torn and bloody sleeve of his shirt that\nhe has taken off to clean and heal his arm. He must wash and mend the\nshirt; it was one he brought from home, after all. \n</p><p>Just\nthen, the door opens and in come Astrid and Eodwulf, midway through a\ndiscussion on the differences in casting gestures for holy and arcane\ncasting. Astrid wrote an assigned essay on it last week, and she is\nexplaining it to Eodwulf. \n</p><p>When\nthey see Caleb, they immediately break off speaking. They do not have\nto say anything; this is familiar, a ritual even. Astrid sighs,\nsympathetic, lays a hand on his shoulder in wordless support. Eodwulf\nsits down on the chair next to Caleb, taking the cloth from him and\nbeginning to wash the wounds. Caleb nods gratefully; the wounds are\nnearly fully healed now, the skin visibly knitting together to its\nusual pale, freckled smoothness again, but he appreciates the\ncloseness. Astrid sits down on his other side, heedless of the fact\nthat the deep armchair is only really meant for one, and begins to\ncast prestidigitation to clean Caleb\u2019s bloody shirt. After she is\nfinished, she casts mending, and at once it is good as new. By this\ntime, Eodwulf is finished healing Caleb\u2019s wounds, and the remaining\ndregs of the potion in the dish and the cloth are pink with blood,\nbut his arm is back to normal.</p><p><i>Good</i>.\nHe will need to be able to practice his spells, he thinks. He must\nbecome stronger, so he does not disappoint Master Ikithon again.</p><p>But\nnot quite yet. The others hold him between them, again an unspoken\nritual. They lean close; they both know that it helps him in moments\nlike this, to have the physicality and the grounding of it. They both\nunderstand, as if it\u2019s not him its one of them. \n</p><p>He\nis pressed between the two of them, and at long last, he begins to\nshake and sob, even though the pain is gone. Somehow, being so close\nto them allows him to let himself cry, and he does, dampening the\nshoulder of Astrid\u2019s shirt with his tears of pain and humiliation,\nas she holds him and Eodwulf strokes his hair. \n</p><p>They\nsit there until the sun goes down, and eventually, Caleb has calmed\ntoo, the pain replaced by weariness as he begins to doze, and finally\nthe tremble in his hands is stilled. \n</p><hr><p>Most\nof the time though, his private lessons do not end like this. If\nMaster Ikithon is happy with his work, then there will be a rare,\nbenevolent smile, a word of praise even. And there is something else\ntoo; a ritual, that comes at the end of the meeting. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon sits him down, and lays two gentle fingers on the side of\nCaleb\u2019s head, just at his temple, then briefly on the other side.\nIt feels almost like a blessing, a benediction. There is magic in\nthat touch, but it is so subtle that Caleb can barely detect it, let\nalone understand it. Not that he spends much time questioning it; the\ntruth that his master has his best interests at heart is one that he\nholds closer than any other, and Caleb trusts him implicitely.</p><p>\u201cVery\ngood, Caleb. You did well today.\u201d And then, the words with which\nhis master always ends their meetings: \u201cstay on this path and don\u2019t\nturn aside, and it will take you far.\u201d</p><hr><p>(There\nare things that don\u2019t match up, sometimes. Because he is very\nperceptive, Caleb notices them occasionally, just. Sometimes, it\u2019s\neveryday things; he will find himself more often in the situation\nwhere he walks through a door and forgets why. Other times, it\u2019s a\nlittle harder to dismiss; he will find himself at the end of a\ncorridor without remembering having walked there, or there will be a\nbloodstain on his cuff that is just a little bit too large to be from\na papercut, even if he remembered getting one.)</p><p>(If\nhe had asked Master Ikithon about these occurrances, they would have\nbeen waved away with a kind smile, advice to get a little more sleep\nat night if he finds himself forgetting things, so that he may\ncontinue to excel in his studies.)</p><p>(In\nthe event though, Caleb mentions nothing of these lapses; he doesn\u2019t\neven tell Astrid and Eodwulf, let alone his master. He wouldn\u2019t\nwant to be thought of as weak or falling behind after all, or worse,\nunworthy of his master\u2019s teaching.)</p><hr><p>Astrid\nhas been working on a particular spell; her hands are dusted black\nwith charcoal when she bursts out of her room to show Caleb and\nEodwulf, who are sitting back to back and studying by the fire. They\nboth look up when she enters the room, the scent of incense drifting\nafter her in a swirling cloud, a proud grin on her face. \n</p><p>On\none arm she wears one of the thick, slightly scorched and stained\nleather gloves that they wear sometimes for their alchemy lessons. \n</p><p>On\nher gloved hand stands a sparrow hawk, feathers a little ruffled but\neyes bright, immediately swivelling to catch the two of them in its\ngaze.</p><p>Eodwulf\u2019s\neyes widen. \u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nmy own familiar!\u201d Astrid\u2019s eyes are shining with pride, bright as\nthe hawk\u2019s. \u201cHis name is Hieronymus.\u201d</p><p>Eodwulf\nraises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve really thought this through, haven\u2019t\nyou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\nI love him already.\u201d</p><p>The\nbird caws, as though in agreement, and cocks his sleek feathered head\ntowards Astrid\u2019s. \n</p><p>Hieronymus\nbecomes a part of their lives, for a while. Astrid changes his form\noften; not long after she first summons him she gathers the\ncomponents she needs once again, and experiments with the form of a\nbearded dragon, then an adder. For a few months he is often found\ncurled around Astrid\u2019s arm or around her neck, gently scenting the\nair with his little forked tongue as she studies in the light of the\nlamp. Then he is a mouse, then a cat, a raven, and, for a few\nmemorable days, an octopus, living in the pond outside in the garden.\nAstrid loves Hieronymus, changing his form to indulge him, she\ndeclares. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nwatching them together, thinks that it helps Astrid, to have him\nthere. When he is in a form with fur, her fingers are always\nstroking, touching it. When he is a serpent, she winds her hand\naround his tail lazily as she thinks. \n</p><p>It\nhelps her though, and for that, Caleb is glad. \n</p><hr><p>Master\nIkithon is a good teacher, but a hard one, and as they have grown\nstronger he has only asked more of them; they are not children, not\nanymore, and they must learn mental fortitude. They must learn not to\nlet themselves be held hostage by their feelings, never to let pity\nget in the way of doing what must be done.</p><p>When\none of them fails, now the others suffer too. \n</p><p>When\none of them fails, they must test their mettle to prove to him that\nthey are still worthy of his training, he says, with logic that none\nof them can argue with. They must work through some of the more\nunpleasant but sadly necessary sides of keeping the Empire safe and\nfree of traitors. \n</p><p>They\nmust prove their faith by demonstrating their latest achievements on\nthe others. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis screaming, as Astrid\u2019s spell strikes him in the chest with a\ncrackling, paralysing ray of dark necrotic energy. He can feel it\ndraining his life force, setting his stomach to churning and cold\nsweat beading on his brow as his vision tunnels. He gasps, as nausea\nwashes over him and ugly black blemishes crawl their way up his arms.</p><p>He\nis on his hands and knees and he can see Astrid, through the hair\nthat has fallen over his eyes. She is standing with her hand\nextended, still channeling the last of the spell. Her teeth are\ngritted, her eyes fixed on him with that forced detachment that they\nall know. Some hair has come loose from her braid at the front, the\nsheen of sweat sticking it to her brow the only signal that betrays\nhow much effort it is taking her to maintain this, to watch Caleb\nwrithe on the floor and not turn aside. Master Ikithon stands behind\nher, Eodwulf on the other side, his hands clasped tight enough to\ndrain the blood from the knuckles as he watches. \n</p><p>Caleb\ndoes not look up, at either Astrid or Eodwulf. He knows from\nexperience that eye contact only makes the it harder for them. If he\nlooks up, it will go on longer, and he does not want them to suffer\nanymore. \n</p><p>It\nwas only a small mistake that she made; just a slight slip in one of\nher spells, but she had wasted a diamond with an ill-cast spell.\nMaster Ikithon is teaching her to be careful with components, a\nlesson that the three of them have never had any pressing need to\nlearn, though an important one. \n</p><p>She\nis being made an example of, and they all know it. Caleb kneels\nretching and convulsing on the floor and wishing he could take her\npain on himself, too. Eodwulf, his face bloodless and his eyes wide\nwith paralysed, forced stillness, is thinking the same, Caleb knows. \n</p><hr><p>\u201cNo,\nslower. You must <i>control</i> the flames, the heat. Keep the water\njust short of the boil for now.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\ngrits his teeth and nods at his teacher, laying his palm just shy of\nflat under the base of the copper tank. Heating slowly has never been his strong point, and Master Ikithon has a way of picking out the little\nimperfections in his casting technique, of making him practice them\nuntil they are no longer imperfections. \n</p><p>He\nallows a thin sheet of flame to coat his palm, heating the water from\nbeneath, and focuses on control. The goal of the exercise is to heat\nthe water as slowly as possible; it should take an hour at the very\nleast to bring it to the boil. \n</p><p>They\u2019ve\npracticed with wax, tar and oil before, which are more forgiving,\ntaking more heat before they are bubbling and frothing at the boil.\nWater requires a lighter touch, the greatest mastery of the flow of\nheat through his fingers. \n</p><p>Still,\nhis teacher said he was ready and Caleb is determined to prove him\nright.</p><hr><p>He\nmasters it, in the end. He shows Astrid and Eodwulf proudly, keeping\nAstrid\u2019s old copper tea-kettle hot for hours with the slow heat\nfrom his palm. The tea is far too strong and bitter by the end, but\nthe other two drink it, loyally and proudly, as the cold edges into\nthe room. It\u2019ll be the first frost of the year tonight, after all;\nfire and warmth and company are all comforting.</p><p>Caleb\nis still buoyed up by the excitement of learning a new spell late\ninto the night, and so it does not occur to him then that this is not\nthe only way that such a skill could be used. \n</p><hr><p>They\nare losing the Zemnian accents to their words, slowly. \n</p><p>At\nthe beginning, of course, they used to speak Zemnian amongst\nthemselves. Now, though, they speak Common increasingly; they\u2019ve\ngrown accustomed to it. Sometimes, one of them will forget a word \u2013\nAstrid snapping her fingers in frustration as she tries to think of\nit, or Eodwulf pulling a face, a self-deprecating laugh and and a\nquick mime, a gesture in the air. <i>You know\u2026that thing</i>. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis not usually the one who forgets. But whenever it happens, it is an\nunspoken agreement that the others will hurry to supply the missing\nword. Especially if they are speaking to Master Ikithon. His\nimpression of them and their conduct matters, of course, above all\nothers. \n</p><p>(He\nnever quite ordered them not to use their mother tongue; not in so\nmany words. But, they all know, it wouldn\u2019t do for him to think\nthat any of them wants to exclude him, for then he might think that\nthey have something to hide; then he might think them ungrateful.)</p><p>(Besides,\nthey are growing more comfortable with Common, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s\ngood practice, they each think. Practice for those bright-shining\nfutures that are laid before their feet.)</p><p>Later\nthey learn other languages, too; they learn Sylvan, and Caleb loves\nthe way the syllables sound on his tongue. He\u2019s good at languages;\nhe seems to pick them up easier than the others, as he does most\nthings. They learn Celestial, and it\u2019s harder but more rewarding;\nthe grammar is strange to Caleb, all complex noun inflections like\nhe\u2019s never heard. He masters it too, in the end, spends nights\nreading ancient tomes just for the thrill of it, just because he can.\n\n</p><p>(He\nand Eodwulf and Astrid speak it sometimes to each other, taking a\nquiet thrill in speaking the language of the Gods. It feels right,\nsomehow. For are the three of them not bright with possibility? These\ngolden three can do anything they set their minds to, even scraping\nthe stars, with Master Ikithon to guide them there of course.)</p><hr><p>\u201cCaleb,\nEodwulf, look what I can do!\u201d \n</p><p>They\nboth rush over, to see what Astrid has done. They find her at the\ntable, and on the table are three small white objects. They are about\nto ask what they are, when Eodwulf draws in a breathy gasp; Caleb\nrecognises what is going on at the same moment.</p><p>They\nare three dead mice, fresh blood staining the fur around their noses\nand mouths. \n</p><p>Astrid\nraises a hand over the mice, and a moment later their bodies are\ntwitching grotesquely, a motion that is life-like, he supposes, but\nsomehow just a little bit off. A moment later, the twitching is\ngrowing stronger, and then the mice are moving, flipping upwards onto\nall fours and then each standing up on their hind legs in a way that\nis utterly different to any living mouse Caleb has ever seen.</p><p>Astrid\nwiggles her fingers, and the mice begin to dance. As they do she\nlooks up at the two of them proudly. Hieronymus is a snake again,\nand he curls over one of her shoulders, tongue lashing out hungrily.\nBut she pushes him back, staying fiercely focussed on the mice on the\ntable in front of her. They leave tiny, bloody smudges of footprints\non the wood of the tabletop.</p><p>It\nis a disturbing sight, but in that moment, Astrid looks so proud and\nhappy, the mere sight makes Caleb\u2019s heart sing. \n</p><hr><p>(There\nare no forbidden books in the library; what there are are books that\nhis mind slides away from, eyes that usually take in every detail\ngliding over their titles without taking them in. Luckily though,\nthese books are not on his reading lists, so it does not impact his\nstudies in any way.)</p><hr><p>Behind\nthe house there is a garden, and in the garden, there is a\nconservatory. The conservatory is bright and spacious, with wicker\nchairs and hanging baskets of flowers. \n</p><p>In\nthe corner of the conservatory, there is a plain wooden door that\nleads to the garden, and they have never seen it opened. Caleb,\nAstrid and Eodwulf don\u2019t think much of it, until they learn that it\ncannot be opened except with a key that Master Ikithon keeps on him\nat all times. \n</p><p>They\nhave been studying with him for about eight months when he first\ntakes them out to the conservatory and unlocks the door. Before they\ncan ask what he is doing, they see the door swing open for the first\ntime. Beyond it, where there should be the garden, there is a stone\nstaircase, a tight spiral lit by magical, ever-burning lamps, going\ndownwards.</p><p>They\nfollow Master Ikithon down the stairs. \n</p><p>The\nspiral goes on for a very long time, longer than Caleb expects;\nthough he\u2019s not quite sure if it really goes down so far or even\nhow much time has passed. There might well be some magic in it, a\nsubtle one he doesn\u2019t recognise yet. None of them talk on the way\ndown, they just keep following, the three students in a row behind\ntheir teacher.</p><p>Eventually,\nthe staircase ends. There is another locked door, there, and this one\ncertainly is magic; the doorjamb and the door itself seems to thrum\nwith it, though the spell is too powerful for him to have learned\nyet. He casts Detect Magic, discretely; he\u2019s in the habit of it, he\nlikes to know things even before Master Ikithon explains them. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb suspected, the door is radiating the bright glow of high-level\nconjuration magic. He looks over at Astrid, sees her frowning as she\nlays a tentative hand on the doorjamb. \n</p><p>Before\nany of them do anything else, though, their master turns to them. In\nthe glow of the magical lights, Master Ikithon\u2019s face is cast in\nstark light and shadow. \u201cOnce we cross this threshold, my bright\nones,\u201d he tells them, \u201cknow that there is a trust between us,\nabove and beyond what has been before.\u201d He raises a hand, smiling\nonce again that benevolent, almost fatherly smile, though it is\nsomewhat melancholic now. \u201cI know, I have already placed a great\ndeal of trust in you three. And I don\u2019t mean to stop now, but there\nare things that you will see and do that require\u2026some extra\ncommitment, on your parts.\u201d He looks steadily at each of them, gaze\npiercing suddenly. Caleb stares determinedly back, holding the look\nuntil it moves on. \u201cCan I trust you to do what must be done for the\nEmpire, to never break under pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He\nnods, smiling once more, the sharpness in him gone almost as soon as\nit came. \u201cI knew I could.\u201d</p><p>And\nwith that, he opens the door for the first time. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb had suspected, the air smells different down here, and the\nchange in temperature and humidity is noticable; it confirms his\nsuspicion that the door is a portal of some kind, to somewhere other\nthan under their master\u2019s house. The corridor is not dark,\nprecisely, but it is dim, the magical lights lower here. They are in\na corridor with heavy steel vault doors in rows along each side. \n</p><p>The\ndoor vanishes behind them. Caleb cannot quite suppress a shiver, even\nthough it isn\u2019t cold.</p><p>\u201cWhere\nare we?\u201d asks Eodwulf. \n</p><p>\u201cWe\nare in Rexxentrum, far beneath the citadel and the castle keep.\u201d\nMaster Ikithon smiles, mildly. \u201cI am your teacher, and teaching\noccupies much of my time these days. But as you may know, I am\ninvolved, in the capacity of\u2026ah, shall we say, more of a trusted\nconsultant now, in matters of intelligence, and specifically of\nquashing rebellion from within the Empire even before it takes root.\u201d\nHe clasps his hands, looks at the three of them standing before him.\n\u201cI am most pleased to inform you, my pupils, that you have come far\nenough that the council has allowed me to\u2026enlist your help with\nthis, in certain ways.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf and Astrid exchange looks of excitement; they have heard\nmuch speculation about their master\u2019s role in the Empire, and\nrumours swirl of an exciting life in the keeping of secrets and\nspying, of daring missions to oust traitors. Could it possibly be\ntrue? And are they really being brought in on that noble task?</p><p>\u201cTo\nwit\u201d their teacher continues, continuing to walk them down the\nstone corridor with its ever burning lamps, \u201cI have decided that\nnow is the time to begin to train you in the art of negotiation. It\nwill serve you well, to be able to glean more information from a\nperson than you give away, and with the strength of your magic now,\nyou are well on your way to becoming just what the Empire needs to\nmaintain the peace.\u201d He stops in front of a great metal-bound door,\ncovered in heavy, complicated locks, both mechanical and glowing with\nthe arcane thrum of spells of locking and warding. He touches a spot\non the door and the locks begin to open one by one, the well-oiled\nslide of steel on steel making almost no noise. After a moment, the\ndoor behind him swings open, revealing another corridor lined with\nheavy locked doors. \n</p><p>Their\nmaster turns around to look at them, hands open towards them.\n\u201cTraitors all, in these cells\u201d he says. \u201cBound to be executed.\nBut it would be a waste to do so without finding out what secrets\nthey can tell us, that we can then use to make the Empire safer,\nwould it not?\u201d</p><p>The\nthree nod fervently; it makes sense, as does everything their teacher\nsays. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon gifts them a rare smile, turning to the corridor. He walks to\na door on the right, opening it to reveal a dwarven woman, dressed in\nrags, her face smeared with blood and grime. She is shackled hand and\nfoot, but it is her eyes that are truly frightening. They seem to\nburn with a cold hatred, an anger and resentment and defiance such as\nCaleb has never seen before. He exchanges looks with Astrid and\nEodwulf, knowing they are having the same thought: <i>this, then, is\nwhat a traitor looks like.</i></p><p>Master\nIkithon, however, seems unfazed, and spreads his hands out to them.\n\u201cThen let us begin our first lesson.\u201d And with that, he walks\ninto the cell. \n</p><p>He\ndoes not look to see if they are following after; he knows that they\nare. \n</p><hr><p>The\nsound of screams of pain, inflicted by their own hands, is already\none that is known to them. \n</p><p>It\nbecomes familiar, the more times they return to that dungeon under\nthe earth. It becomes commonplace, even, though when that happened\nnone of them can quite tell. \n</p><hr><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf are being punished, today. \n</p><p>Last\nnight they had fallen asleep over their written work together, heads\npillowed on each other\u2019s shoulders as they had studied for a test.\nAstrid had come back from a lesson to find them, and she had woken\nthem to keep studying \u2013 knowing, of course, exactly what they would\nwant her to do \u2013 but it had not been enough. They had taken the\ntest in the morning, and Eodwulf had failed. Caleb had scraped a\npassing grade, at least by Academy standards. But then, this is not\nthe academy; only the best is good enough. It is enough to distress\nCaleb terribly; usually, his grades are impeccable, but he has been\nputting in extra work lately, trying to add more and more time in the\ndungeons too. He needs to be stronger, he knows. Less forgiving, less\nmerciful. \n</p><p>Perhaps\nMaster Ikithon knows this, for this time, it is Caleb who is chosen\nto inflict the punishment. \n</p><p>He\nlooks into Eodwulf\u2019s eyes as he closes his fingers around his\nfriend\u2019s wrist, which is trembling very slightly. <i>Don\u2019t show\nfear!</i> Caleb wants to cry out, but he cannot, as his master stands\nbehind him. \n</p><p>Instead\nhe grits his teeth and holds on to Eodwulf\u2019s arm, ignites his palm\nand refuses to look away as his dear friend cries out for mercy. The\nsmell of burning skin \u2013 sickeningly familiar, now - begins to fill\nthe room, and Caleb is trembling, but his teacher\u2019s shadow is\nbehind him. A little way further back, he is distantly aware of the\nsound of Astrid\u2019s muffled sobs. \n</p><p>He\ntells himself that he and Eodwulf deserve this. He tells himself it\nwill be over quickly. Tears spill down his face, but he does not turn\nor look away.</p><p>It\nis over, in the end. Afterwards, when they have been judged to have\nlearned their lesson, Master Ikithon sends them away to the healing\npotion store with benevolent mercy.</p><p>They\nall sleep in Astrid\u2019s room that night, curled up on the bed\ntogether, crying until they all have no tears left. \n</p><p>At\nleast until the next time. \n</p><hr><p>They\nare given leave to return home to Blumenthal for visits,\noccasionally. They travel there for Harvest Close, or a little before\n\u2013 they all know that their parents need the extra pairs of hands to\nhelp with the harvest \u2013 or, sometimes, for Winter\u2019s Crest. \n</p><p>This\nis how it is the winter they are sixteen. \n</p><p>(This\nis not the last time they will return, nor the second last. But it is\nthe last that Caleb will be able to remember, from the distance of\nmany years and a broken second life, as truly happy.)</p><p>They\nare at Eodwulf\u2019s parents\u2019 house, and outside the window, snow is\nfalling gently. Their families are all there, as are some of the\nfamilies of the other children they knew, when they really were\nchildren; Caleb shares glances with Astrid and Eodwulf and knows that\nthey are thinking the same thing. How long it\u2019s been, how much\nthey\u2019ve grown beyond this place. The others that they left behind\nare living in a completely different world, and none of the three\nquite know how they should interact with this place they have left\nbehind. \n</p><p>It\u2019s\ncomforting, yes, in the way that home is, all soft colours and\nhalf-remembered voices. It smells like childhood. It\u2019s good to hear\nand speak Zemnian again, but if one more person informs Caleb he\u2019s\npicked up an accent, he mutters to the other two, he has half a mind\nto just up and leave.</p><p>He\ndoesn\u2019t leave, of course. He\u2019s finding himself too at ease for\nthat. The night carries on, as the snow falls softly outside. He\ndoesn\u2019t always feel at ease, talking to people \u2013 apart from his\nfamily, and Eodwulf and Astrid of course \u2013 but here, tonight, he\ndoes. He mingles around the room, but always he is watching them from\nthe corners of his eye. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nis spinning illusions for his little cousins, making even the adults\ngasp and praise his skill. The children are positively delighted,\ntheir small hands grabbing at a flight of miniature birds, seven baby\nrabbits hopping across the floor, a dancer in shimmering silks and\nsatins spinning in the centre of the floor to illusory music. Eodwulf\nstands in the centre of it, smiling in that shy way he has when\npeople compliment him, as though he doesn\u2019t know what to say. \n</p><p>Astrid\nstands a little way off, clapping and cheering for Eodwulf\u2019s\nillusions louder than any of the others. Her eyes catch Caleb\u2019s\nacross the room and she grins, beckoning him over to join in. \n</p><p>And\nof course, he goes.</p><p>Later\nin the evening, food is served \u2013 Eodwulf\u2019s family always makes\nthe best food, but everyone from the village has brought something to\nshare. There is hot, spiced wine, kept hot above a brazier in a brass\nbowl polished carefully to a mirror shine. Caleb knows what\u2019s\ncoming next; he remembers this from his childhood. He wasn\u2019t old\nenough then to be given more than a thimbleful, but he had loved to\nwatch anyway. He still does, smiling as Eodwulf\u2019s mother places a\nlittle wire shelf above the bowl, a loaf of solid sugar on top of it\nwhich she then soaks in rum. An anticipatory hush falls.</p><p>Then\nshe smiles, strikes a match, and sets it alight. \n</p><p>It\nburns orange for a moment, then bright blue, clear flames rippling\nalong the crystalline surface of the sugar. After a moment it begins\nto melt the sugar, dripping down into the wine. Magical fire is also\nblue sometimes, he finds himself thinking. It looks different though;\nit takes an expert to tell, but he knows fire, now. He knows how it\nbehaves, he knows how to create it and control it, the shapes it\nmakes and how it catches and spreads. \n</p><p>He\nrealises he is daydreaming as his mother touches his shoulder, and\nCaleb feels himself start, then smile, as Astrid elbows her way\nthrough the crowd of people filling the small sitting room, placing a\ncup in his hands. \n</p><p>He\nthanks her as he takes it, feeling the warmth glow against his hands.\nHe sips, enjoying the warmth and sweetness, the spirit already\nbeginning to heat his throat. \n</p><p>Astrid\nwanders off the other side of the room as the party resumes again,\nlouder now. But Caleb hangs back slightly. He is thinking about fire;\nit\u2019s true what his teacher says, he thinks, his mind a little warm\nand muzzy with the drink. It\u2019s true that fire can create new\nthings, as much as it can destroy. All this\u2026whatever they do, in\nthat dungeon, it\u2019s all for the sake of the citizens of the Empire,\nfor people like these, leading safe lives like the ones the three of\nthem were raised to. It\u2019s all to protect them from the threat of\nchaos, of the dark that threatens to destroy them. \n</p><p>And\nin this moment it\u2019s absolutely worth it.</p><p>\u201cHaving\na good time, <i>Erdbeerchen</i>?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\nblinks, lifting his eyes from his cup at the sound of the childhood\nnickname; he\u2019s been gazing down into it for a few minutes now, he\nrealises, and not talking to anyone. <i>Right</i>; he remembers that\nwhen he does that, most people interpret it as him not having a good\ntime. \n</p><p>Not\nhis mother though; she knows him too well. She knows that he can\u2019t\nhandle large groups that well, though it\u2019s gotten a little easier\nsince he was a child. He looks up at her and smiles. \u201c<i>Ja,\nMutti</i>.\u201d</p><p>She\nruffles his hair, a scant shade darker red than he own. \u201cGood.\u201d\nShe raises an eyebrow asking for permission and he sighs, nods, lets\nher pull him in for a hug; suddenly he realises that in the time he\u2019s\nbeen away, he\u2019s grown as tall as she is. She pulls away, holding\nhim by the shoulders and inspecting him with an affectionate but\ncritical eye. He expects her to ask him if he\u2019s been using the\nsalve she gave him for his acne last time he was home, or tell him he\nlooks like he hasn\u2019t been sleeping enough, or some other such\nthing. But instead she grins, her eyes flicking off the the corner to\nwhere Astrid and Eodwulf are talking, their heads close together over\ntheir cups\nof wine. <br></p><p>\n\u201cWhich\none of them is it that makes you look at them like that?\u201d his\nmother asks, and Caleb chokes a little, already feeling a blush rise. <br></p><p>\u201cYou three are so inseparable these days, your father and I are\nhaving trouble telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\nno, it\u2019s not like that - \u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh.\u201d\nShe smiles, teasing. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be embarrassed. It\u2019s\nhow it is, at your age, and first love is an excitement\nthat-\u201d\n</p><p>\u201c<i>Mutti</i>\u2026\nno, I mean I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say\u2026ah\u2026l-love\u2026\u201d\nthe word burns with possibility in his mouth, but more than that; it\nfeels strange and ill-fitting for what is between them, even\nreductive. It is a given, isn\u2019t it, that he loves Eodwulf and\nAstrid? They spend each day together, bound by their destiny, sharing\neverything. But he doesn\u2019t think that is the kind of love she\nmeans. He stares determinedly down into his cup, a grown-out lock of\nhair falling over his face. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cCaleb.\n<i>Mein liebling</i>. Look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\nflounders, as she leans forward and tucks the hair behind his ear. It\nis an affectionate gesture, but one that also means he has to meet\nher eye. She is merely looking at him with raised eyebrows. \u201cOnly\nyou can say what you really feel. And that means taking a good hard\nlook at what\u2019s in your heart, and not turning away from it.\u201d She\nsmiles. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen the way you\u2019ve been looking all evening,\nso I think you know already, somewhere in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\nsighs, looking back over at Astrid and Eodwulf. Astrid is telling a\nstory, gesturing with her free hand in the air, the firelight dancing\noff her glasses and golden waves of hair that is loose over her\nshoulder for once, unbraided and catching the light in burnished\ngold. Eodwulf is laughing at what she was saying, his cheeks dimpling\nas he smiles. He takes a sip of wine and the apple of his throat bobs\nup and down.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ntakes a drink too, sure his face is on fire now. He turns back to his\nmother, who is stifling laughter. \u201cSorry\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2026you\ndon\u2019t have to tell me, you know. Not if you don\u2019t want to. Just\nas long as you are being careful and safe\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>M</i><i>utt</i><i>er!</i>\u201d\nhe blurts out, wishing he could sink into the floor, as she pats him\nconsolingly on the arm. He sighs, looking down. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\nboth of them, a bit. But it\u2019s not like that, with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\nnarrows her eyes for a second, and he knows she is reading him,\nseeing that what he says is the truth. She always had placed her\ntrust in him, even as a child. She hums sympathetically, dropping her\nvoice a little for the words she says next. \u201cBut I think\u2026you want\nit to be\u2026or am I wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\ngrimaces, still half wishing to sink through the floor, but also,\nsurprisingly, finding himself glad to have someone to speak about\nthis with. \u201c\u2026Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm\u2026\nthat\u2019s a difficult problem. Have you tried\u2026saying anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>His\neyes widen, slightly appalled. \u201cOh, no! I couldn\u2019t possibly\u2026\u201d\nhe tails off, at her expression. He hesitates, face burning. \u201c<i>Mutti</i>,\njust\u2026say that there was something\u2026\u201d he ignores her triumphant\nsmile, resolute. \u201cSay that there was something\u2026that I wanted to\nsay to someone.\u201d His face burns hotter than fire. \u201cHow would I\neven\u2026\u201d he gestures wildly. \n</p>\n<p>Her\ngentle smile makes him pause, as she takes his hand in hers. \u201cJust\nsay it. I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s no other way.\u201d She sends a look\nover to where the other two stand, still talking in low voices. \u201cBut\nyou know\u2026 I think you\u2019re lucky to have them, and they to have\nyou. You three\u2026\u201d she shook her head, \u201cyou three have a magic\nbetween you, that\u2019s not just the kind you learn in your classes.\nYou\u2019ve always been better together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsmiles to himself, as she ran her thumb over the back of his hand. \u201cI\nknow, <i>Mutti</i>. And\u2026 thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\nhugs him again, and he lets himself smile wider as her hair tickles\nhis face. \u201cAny time, <i>Kr</i><i>\u00fc</i><i>melchen</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Mutt</i><i>er</i>\u2026\nplease <i>s</i>top\nit\u2026 I\u2019m not a baby anymore\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Her\nlaughter is as warm as he always remembered it, mingling with the\ncontented chatter and quiet music of the room. She touches his cheek,\nlooking into his eyes with a proud smile, that is also slightly\nmelancholic; she misses the days of his childhood when he was at home\nwith her, he realises then. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry\u201d she says, cupping his cheek. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><hr><p>He\nthinks about what she\u2019s said with a slightly clearer head on the\njourney back, as the carriage jostles him back and forth. The three\nare bundled up in warm knitted clothes for the journey, and Caleb is\nbeginning to feel very warm. It\u2019s not the many layers though; it\u2019s\nbecause he is sitting squeezed in between the two of them in two\nseats. The other seats are occupied by a large basket of freshly\nbaked bread, almond crescent cookies and gingerbread stars and cakes\nfilled with sweet plum jam. Gifts from their parents, as well as new\nknitted clothes to keep them warm in the winter, and a new fur-lined\ncloak each \u2013 these they are actually wearing, as it\u2019s cold on the\njourney. There is also a wheel of cheese of the kind they remember\nfrom their childhoods in the village, a small cask containing ale,\nmade by Caleb\u2019s father\u2019s cousin, who is the village brewer.\nSeveral clumsy wooden toys whittled by the younger children, just\nlearning their craft. A beautifully embroidered quilt from Eodwulf\u2019s\ngrandmother. A wood flute like Astrid\u2019s uncle used to play on\nsummer nights under the moon. \n</p>\n<p>Simple\ngifts, but they are glad of them. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nand Eodwulf are leaning against both of his shoulders and dozing as\nthey journey back to their master\u2019s house. Astrid\u2019s hair tickles\nhis nose, and Eodwulf\u2019s wool-gloved hand has come to rest on the\nseat, just touching Caleb\u2019s knee.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\nnot new, of course. Or at least, not the closeness of them. Caleb and\nAstrid and Eodwulf have long passed the point in their friendship at\nwhich falling asleep curled together on the soft chairs in their\nlittle common room is ordinary. It is a source of comfort. When their\nmaster punishes them, or on nights when the nightmares come for one\nor the other of them, they will sometimes wordlessly slip into each\nother\u2019s rooms, not even needing to speak as they curl up together.\nThey\u2019re all used to closeness, to the gentle rhythm of each other\u2019s\nsleep breathing, the warm weight of each other pressed close. Them\nagainst the world. They understand this. \n</p>\n<p>Always\nbefore though, Caleb has imagined that this is what having siblings\nis like, but now, suddenly, it feels unimaginably different from\nthat. But to say that his mother\u2019s half-teasing, half insistent\nenquiring, has set him to rethinking that is a vast understatement;\nit has set off a firestorm inside his head, full of dangerous\npossibilities. Making his face heat even to contemplate, but somehow\nimpossible to look away from. \n</p>\n<p>And\ndoesn\u2019t he of all people know the possibilities of fire, doesn\u2019t\nhe know the way it spreads if left to itself?</p>\n<p>Astrid\u2019s\nhead nods against his chest, over his heart, and Caleb feels fire run\nup and down his whole body.</p>\n<p>Resignedly,\nhe raises the fur-lined travel blanket up to tuck around Astrid more\nfully, then hesitates for a moment, then lays his own head down on\ntop of Eodwulf\u2019s, pointedly resisting the sudden and urge to drop a\nkiss right in the center of his hair, where it parts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Verdammt!</i>\u201d\nCaleb mutters to himself, as he closes his eyes in resignation.</p>\n<hr><p>It\nis Eodwulf he kisses first, in the dim light of the lamp one night\nwhen Astrid is at a lesson. It is some months after the conversation with his mother, and he knows the others feel it too, now; the signs are there, or maybe they were all along, if only he had been looking. <br></p><p>It was only a matter of time.<br></p><p>They are sitting together by the fire,\nand silence has fallen; the kind of companionable silence that exists\nwhen people know each other so well that they understand each other\nperfectly without the need for words. Behind them, the fire is a dim\nred glow, and Caleb can see it reflected and dancing in miniature, in\nEodwulf\u2019s dark eyes, turned to molten amber in the firelight that\ncatches there. He feels something hitch in his chest, as they each\nlean forward, warm breath mingling between them as their lips meet.</p>\n<p>They\nare there for some time, kissing in the quiet.</p>\n<p>In\nfact, it is more time than Caleb thinks. Usually, he is able to know\nwhat time it is with perfect accuracy. But time, it seems, is\ndifferent in this situation \u2013 a fact he files away for future\nreference - because Astrid is back from her lesson. \n</p>\n<p>She\nknows immediately. Caleb sees it in her eyes, the small tug of a\nsmile at the corner of her mouth. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\npulls away quicker than Caleb, his face endearingly alarmed. He\ndoesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings. \u201cAstrid! We were just\u2026\u201d he\ntails off vaguely, darting a glance at Caleb. \n</p>\n<p>He\ncan\u2019t help it; he immediately starts laughing, buoyed up by the\ntouch of Eodwulf\u2019s lips he can still feel against his. Astrid\nstarts laughing too, her face splitting into a mischievous grin.\n\u201cWell\u201d she says, \u201cI knew it was going to happen at some point.\u201d\nShe takes Caleb\u2019s hand, then Eodwulf\u2019s, looking endearingly\nvulnerable for a moment. As though asking for permission. Caleb takes\nher hand, holds it fiercely, tightly close, and she smiles again,\ncarrying on. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry you had to start without me.\u201d</p>\n<hr><p>Time\npasses, as time does.</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Master Ikithon are in the dungeons again, down the spiral from\nthe conservatory and into what sometimes seems like another world, in\ncontrast to the bright garden from which they enter that place. It is\neasier, Caleb has found, to think of it so; to separate these trips\nfrom the rest of his life. Some part of him, then, can pretend that\nthe work they do here is not real, that it is not a real person who\nscreams under his touch. \n</p>\n<p>The\nman \u2013 the traitor \u2013 is naked and submerged in water up to his\nneck, a large copper vessel almost like a bathtub. The metal conducts\nheat well; this Caleb knows from his lessons in alchemy. Chains run\nfrom his ankles, wrists and throat to heavy iron brackets on the\nwalls. \n</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon nods at him, and Caleb lays a hand against the copper\nexterior of the bath. \n</p>\n<p>He\nhas long since mastered the technique of heating water with\nexcruciating slowness, but they have been down here for some time\nnow; clouds of steam are beginning to roll off the top of the water,\nrising into the air which is growing hot and humid, though they are\ndeep in the dungeons. Caleb\u2019s face is shiny and dripping with sweat\nfrom the heat, but his hands do not shake as he lays them against the\nmetal. \n</p>\n<p>His\nteacher is watching him, after all. \n</p>\n<p>The\nheat rises, and the man in the bathtub begins to scream. All the\nwhile, Master Ikithon stands behind him with his hands clasped neatly\nbehind his back, asking questions in a voice with no inflection. He\nis thorough; he teases out information, getting into every corner and\nleaving nothing that could be of significance. \n</p>\n<p><i>Who\nwas your leader? When and where did the group meet? Did any of the\nothers get away? What were the plans if it went wrong? Where was your\nhideout? Do any of the other conspirators have families in the city?</i>\nAnd on and on. Caleb is expected to remember this, to take careful\nmental notes. Sometimes, after all, it is him doing the questioning.</p>\n<p>They\nall resist, at first; Caleb has come to know this. They all put up a\nshow of sticking to their treasonous principles. But when they are in\npain, when their minds are cooking within their flesh, then the truth\nspills. It takes control and attention to catch it as it does,\nthrough a semi-conscious haze and screams of agony, but Caleb is\nlearning. \n</p>\n<p>All\nfor the good of the empire, Caleb thinks, feeling a rush of\nsatisfaction as Master Ikithon nods to him approvingly, as he turns\nthe heat in the water up a little more. He is becoming good at\ntelling when they have no more to give, when the end must come. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare not unmerciful, after all. They are not cruel, they only seek the\ntruth, and once it has gone these traitors are mere husks, empty and\nworthless. Yet they still must be punished. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nraises the temperature of the water to boiling, the hiss mingling\nwith the man\u2019s final, exhausted scream. \n</p>\n<hr><p>The\nfollowing summer, Eodwulf almost breaks. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nnever finds out exactly what happened. He and Astrid spend a brief\ntime speculating, but neither quite have the words to speak about it.\n\n</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s\nwhat they know; they know that Eodwulf is growing strong in his\nmagic. They know that Master Ikithon is teaching him to pry open\nminds, to spin illusions to strike fear and then pick their heads\nlike locks and break inside, to better let them spill their secrets\nto him. For the sake of the Empire, of course. Some traitors have\nmuch more to yield if given this treatment. It depends on the person,\nas their teacher says. Everyone has their own way in which they\nbreak. \n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\ndangerous, Caleb knows; such things are not his main area of study,\nbut he knows that Eodwulf has had trouble in the past with not\nletting them into his own mind. From what he knows, for that sort of\nmagic one\u2019s own empathy needs to be both sharpened and blunted all\nat once. This is to allow the connection and the mastery over the\ntarget to be strong and pervasive enough to do what must be done,\nwhile protecting one\u2019s own mind from the strain, or from\nretaliatory attacks. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and a fine line to\nwalk. \n</p>\n<p>They\ndo not know exactly what Eodwulf learns in his private lessons with\ntheir teacher, in the dungeons under the conservatory; it feels\nsafer, somehow, not to know.</p>\n<p>One\ngolden summer day, Caleb and Astrid are sitting in the garden\nreading. Or rather, Caleb is reading, and Astrid has set down her\nbook, is lying down in the grass across Caleb\u2019s lap and idly\nlevitating his wide-brimmed straw hat in the air above his head. It\u2019s\nstill a good sunshade; she keeps it expertly in place, shading his\nface and eyes so that his paler skin does not burn in the noonday\nsun. It\u2019s a companionable silence between them.</p>\n<p>The\nsilence is broken by the slamming open of the door to the\nconservatory, and Caleb frowns, closing his book as Eodwulf appears\nat the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstrid\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She\ndrops the spell, and the hat flops neatly back down over Caleb\u2019s\nhead. He pulls up the brim to exchange a look as she sits up, looking\nover to where Eodwulf is running across the garden back to the house.</p>\n<p>There\nis something in the way he is running; desperation, fear. \n</p>\n<p>They\ncan\u2019t see his face from this distance. But it looks almost as\nthough he\u2019s running away from something. \n</p>\n<hr><p>There\nis punishment, for running away from one\u2019s duties. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nis sitting on the ground, crying soundless tears and biting down hard\nenough on her lip to draw blood. Her glasses are cracked and her eyes\nare blank and staring into nothingness as Eodwulf stands in front of\nher, a trembling hand extended. Master Ikithon\u2019s hand is on his\nshoulder, his face grave. Illusion magic swirls about him, as Eodwulf\nchannels the spell that is making Astrid see horrors dance before her\neyes. Caleb feels a rush of sympathy for them both. The last time\nEodwulf made a mistake, it was Caleb who had to be the subject of his\ncorrective practice. Afterwards, Eodwulf had come to him gushing\napologies, curling up in Caleb\u2019s lap and sobbing. All Caleb had\nbeen able to do was hold him, stroking his hair and telling him that\nreally, he had been all right.</p>\n<p>(He\nhadn\u2019t been all right, actually; he had seen a detailed illusory\nimage of a dragon devouring his family, ripping them limb from limb\nwhile he was held in place and unable to go to them, and it still\nweighed on his mind, though he knew it was not real.)</p>\n<p>Eventually,\nAstrid had joined them, letting a weasel-formed Hieronymus curl\nsinuously around Eodwulf\u2019s neck as he sobbed into Caleb\u2019s\nshoulder. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, it would be different, Caleb knows. The look in Eodwulf\u2019s\neyes is different; something has tipped like a scale inside him. \n</p>\n<p>Suddenly,\nEodwulf is lowering his hand, the magic dissipating like smoke as\nAstrid slumps sideways. Caleb doesn\u2019t even know if she\u2019s\nconscious, and he wants nothing more than to run to her side. But in\nthat moment, he dare not. His eyes are fixed on Eodwulf, who had\nstopped casting his spell, in defiance of Master Ikithon\u2019s orders. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u201d\nEodwulf whispers, almost a question. As though he cannot believe the\nchoice he just made. His eyes are filled with tortured defiance,\ndarting toward their master, then looking back at the ground as\nthough he cannot look anymore. \u201cNo\u201d he says again, eyes filling\nwith tears as he falls to his knees. \u201cNo, no no no\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nis about to reach out to him \u2013 though the look in their master\u2019s\neyes is one of disappointment, and reaching out to Eodwulf suddenly,\nin this moment, feels dangerous, as though fear and weakness is a\ndisease that is contagious \u2013 but before he can, Eodwulf turns, with\none last look at Master Ikithon, and runs from the room. \n</p>\n<p>Their\nmaster does no follow him, merely sighs, deep and disappointed. He\nshakes his head in sorrow, looking over at Astrid \u2013 beginning to\nlever herself up off the floor, wiping her tear-stained face roughly\nwith her sleeve \u2013 and Caleb, shuffling over to be at least by her\nside. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cClass\ndismissed,\u201d says their master, his voice heavy with regret, and\nsweeps from the room, leaving behind a sense that whatever had\nhappened here today is not over.  \n</p>\n<hr><p>When\nCaleb and Astrid return to their little common room, Eodwulf is not\nthere. They knock on his bedroom door. He has barricaded it shut \u2013\nwith a chair under the handle rather than magic - and only relents\nwhen they threaten to blast it open. At this he opens the door only a\ncrack, one dark eye appears in the gap and looking at the two of\nthem, reproachful. \u201c<i>Was?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Astrid\nplaces her hands on her hips, standing square in the doorway. She\nanswers deliberately in Common, voice accustory.  \u201cWhy did you\nstop?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nopens the door a little more, and Caleb can see the droop of his\nshoulders. \u201cBecause\u2026because I was hurting you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Idiot</i><i>!</i>\u201d\nshe snaps. Anyone else might think that she is angry, but Caleb knows\nthe truth. It is always fear that makes Astrid sharp as glass. Fear\nfor Eodwulf though; it\u2019s always for one of the two of them, never\nfor herself. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t just\u2026\u201d she gestures with a\nhand in the air, agitated. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2026<i>not</i> do it!\nYou can\u2019t refuse him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nhangs his head, looking away from her sullenly, not defending\nhimself. \n</p>\n<p>This\nonly seems to make things worse. In her anger, she summons\nHieronymus with a click of her fingers. He appears around her throat\nin the form of a snake, hissing along with her words. \u201cIf you\u2026if\nyou can\u2019t do something so simple, to someone you\u2026\u201d Astrid\nbreaks off, biting her lip. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have the strength it\ntakes. It\u2019s fucking <i>selfish</i> to stop because of me, when you\n<i>know</i> I\u2019m stronger than that!\u201d She\u2019s glaring at him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d She takes a deep breath, looking\nat Caleb for support. He lays a slightly trembling hand on her arm.\n\u201cAnd we can get through it together, and at the end we\u2019ll all be\ndefending the Empire together. But\u2026\u201d her fingers clench in the\nsleeve of her shirt, ruching the fabric. \u201cBut we can\u2019t just stop\nnow. We\u2019ve come too far. We have to keep going! <i>Stay on this\npath and don\u2019t turn aside</i>\u2026remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy\nfor you to say\u201d counters Eodwulf, voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\nI\u2019m not strong like you. And I\u2019m not smart like Caleb\u2026\u201d he\nsighs, running fingers through his hair, stopping Caleb\u2019s protest\nwith a raised hand. \u201cI\u2026 sometimes\u2026\u201d he meets Astrid\u2019s\nglare, desperate, eyes filled with panic suddenly. \u201cSometimes, I\ndon\u2019t know if I can do this, <i>mein</i><i>e</i><i> S</i><i style=\"background-color: transparent;\">onnenblume</i>\u2026\u201d\nEodwulf looks to Caleb for help as Astrid winces, crossing her arms\nover her chest and turning away. \n</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Nein!</i>\nStop it! You <i>don\u2019t</i> get to say you can\u2019t do it. Not now,\nnot ever!\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, squeezing Astrid\u2019s arm in a wordless gesture of comfort,\nmeeting Eodwulf\u2019s eyes at the same time. He reaches out to take his\nhand, but Eodwulf twitches away, so Caleb drops his hand awkwardly at\nhis side. \u201cShe\u2019s right, though. If Master Ikithon sent you away\nfrom here\u2026\u201d he lets the sentence hang in the air, as they all\nimagine it. It was always supposed to be the three of them, after\nall; they wouldn\u2019t know what to do, how to be, with just two. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nsighs. \u201cHe\u2026he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d But Caleb can hear the uncertainty\nin his voice. Eodwulf wrings his hands, looking between the two of\nthem. He seems to only half be looking at their faces. \u201cNot for\nthis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, stepping up and putting an arm around Astrid, whose hands are\nballed in fists at her sides, her shoulders tense. \u201cEodwulf - \u201d</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can say more, there\u2019s a knock at the door. They all\nstart; it is a vanishingly rare occurrence that their teacher should\ncome to visit them after hours, unless in the case of a momentous\nastronomical even that he would have them witness. Yet still, they\nall know the sound of his knock, even the sound of his footsteps in\nthe hall. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, Eodwulf flinches violently at the sound, begins scrubbing at\nhis teary eyes with a sleeve with desperate haste.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ngets up to open it. Their teacher is there, but he doesn\u2019t look\nangry. He almost never does \u2013 only disappointed. Now, though, he\nseems to have easily slipped back into the mild-mannered, slightly\nindulgent smile, though it is a little aggrieved looking. \n</p>\n<p>He\nregrets having to punish them; he always tells them so. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\nCaleb. May I see Eodwulf, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nblinks a little, nodding quickly, and already Eodwulf is there beside\nhim, and only Caleb is close enough to see the stiffness in his\nmuscles, fear and panic written in every line of his body. \n</p>\n<hr><p>The\nnext day Caleb stands in resolute stillness beside Astrid, both\ndrawing as much comfort as they can afford to allow themselves from\nthe closeness between them. It is just the two of them, and the\nsilence hangs over the whole house, heavy and oppressive. Neither of\nthem can concentrate on any work. \n</p>\n<p>He\nknows, at least, what Astrid is thinking, as she lets Hieronymus\ntwine about her fingers, quickly enough to indicate that she is\nnervous. She could send him to spy, but she does not, and Caleb\ndoesn\u2019t ask her to. \n</p>\n<p>He\nunderstands, because he is thinking the same thing, as they watch the\ndoor to their little sitting room, cautious glances cast from beneath\ntheir lashes. They are waiting for it to open, yet it does not, all\nday.</p>\n<p><i>That\nwill never be me</i>, Caleb thinks. <i>I will become stronger, so\nthat I never have to displease Master Ikithon so. I will not break,\nnot for anything. I must be made of steel and stone.</i></p>\n<p>At\nnight, Caleb and Astrid cling together in Astrid\u2019s bed, without any\nwords. No words are necessary; only the comfort that they can give\neach other, just by being close. They curl up together, and Caleb\nfalls asleep with his face pressed into the hollow of Astrid\u2019s\nthroat, her chin resting on the crown of his head.</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nis back the next day, quieter than usual but otherwise the same.</p>\n<p>Or\nnot quite the same; they do not speak of it, but there is something\ndifferent about him. Caleb can\u2019t quite place it at first, until he\ncan; the look in Eodwulf\u2019s eyes is different, after whatever\npunishment Master Ikithon dealt out. Eodwulf looks far away, his eyes\nnot quite making contact as they used to. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nnotices it immediately too. The two of them do not speak about their\nargument the day before; somehow, such a discussion seems reduntant,\nnow. \n</p>\n<p>And\nEodwulf is different in other ways, after that. More withdrawn,\nslower to show his emotions and slower to cry, either with joy or\nsorrow. They\u2019ve all changed, over the years, but this is the time\nthat Caleb and Astrid see it most clearly. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare happy for him, they tell themselves. Eodwulf is stronger now, and\nhe will not make the same mistake again. This, they can see in his\neyes more than anything, eyes that tell a little less now. Eyes that\nare a little darker, a little blanker, but not so quick to betray\nhim. More driven and hungry, more steel behind the softness.</p>\n<p>Caleb\u2019s\nmind slips away from the shadows under those eyes, slightly deeper\nthan before. He\u2019s almost jealous. Eodwulf also seems to have mended\nfences with Master Ikithon; though of course, their teacher was\nalways the sort who would forgive them in the end. They are his\nshining stars, after all, the bright future of the Empire.</p>\n<p><i>Just\nas long as they stay on the path, and do not turn aside.</i></p>\n<hr><p>Eodwulf\ncuts his hair short, that year. It has always been long, not as long\nas Astrid\u2019s golden braid \u2013 which she has taken to looping around\nher head and pinning into a neat little crown with pins that seem to\nturn up everywhere, even amongst Caleb\u2019s spell components and\nwriting materials \u2013 but long enough to hang in soft, inky ringlets\nto about his shoulders. With short hair, Eodwulf looks so different\nthat for a brief moment Caleb doesn\u2019t recognise him. But then there\nis Astrid\u2019s gasp, running over to Eodwulf and immediately carding\nher fingers through his short hair, and Caleb is smiling too, telling\nhim that it looks better now. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn\u2019t know if he actually thinks that; it makes Eodwulf look\nolder, and certainly more attractive. You can see his face fully now,\nwhereas before his eyes would often be half-covered by a fall of\nhair. And the part of Caleb that makes his heart flutter whenever he\nwatches Eodwulf\u2019s hands at work, that melts into his arms when\ntheir lips meet in a passionate kiss\u2026that part of him is all for\nit. But there\u2019s another part, a part that loved the feeling of\nrunning his fingers through thick dark locks, a part that remembered\nhow much a younger Eodwulf had taken pride in his long hair, and\nwondered if the loss of the sweet and shy child who had been one of\nhis two best friends long before they had ever become lovers was\nworth the price. It\u2019s not just hair, after all; something else has\nchanged, something that goes bone-deep. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn\u2019t say this though; instead he promises to lend Eodwulf the\nhair pomade that his father gave him, the very moment he learned that\nCaleb would be mixing with the nobles in the city. The smell reminds\nCaleb powerfully of his childhood; his father would comb the stuff\nthrough Caleb\u2019s hair to tame his wild ginger mop, for special\noccasions; births, marriages, funerals, festivals of all sorts. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\naccepts it with a smile and a nod, but his eyes betray nothing. \n</p>\n<hr><p>They\nhave certain unspoken agreements, the three of them; truths that they\nnever quite decided outright, boundaries that they do not cross,\nwithout being quite able to say why. \n</p>\n<p>One\nof these is that they rarely speak to each other of what goes on in\ntheir private lessons with their master. For rhe ones that take place\nin the dungeons below the conservatory, this goes double. And those\nlessons are becoming more and more frequent; Master Ikithon must know\nthat they all have the strength to be able to do what must be done,\nthinks Caleb with a slight glow of pride.</p>\n<p>Today\nis one of the exceptions, and Astrid is the reason for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\nso, once I had asked that question, Master Ikithon seemed terribly\npleased that I\u2019d apparently hit the nail on the head of a whole\narea of scholarship\u2026did you know that there are many philosophers\nof magic over the years who have done experiments on whether the\nundead can feel pain?\u201d Astrid is prestidigitating the blood and\nviscera off her over-tunic, as the others watch. One spell isn\u2019t\nenough to get it clean, so she\u2019s doing it repeatedly, telling Caleb\nand Eodwulf about her most recent lesson as she works. \u201cAnd he\nseemed excited that my questions had gone to that place - \u201d she\nsmiles proudly \u201c - and loaned me several books\u2026\u201d she waves a\nbloody hand over at the large stack of books on the floor beside her.\n\n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf exchange a look of recognition, and pride; they\nunderstand why Astrid is so animated, after all. They all live for\nthe feeling of their teacher telling them that their thinking on a\nparticular topic is sound. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\nI take it it became a practical lesson?\u201d Caleb asks, raising an\neyebrow. When one of them begins a philosophical discussion, their\nmaster is always the first to encourage them to test their findings,\nand learn more.</p>\n<p>Astrid\nfreezes, then nods slowly. \u201cIt did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nand Caleb exchange another look. \u201c\u2026And?\u201d</p>\n<p>Astrid\nswallows, pressing her lips together for a moment, before looking up\nat them. \u201cAll experiments show that the undead do feel pain. The\nmanner and degree seems to depend very much on how recently death\noccurred, type of undead, the level of the spell used to resurrect\nthem, the strength and character of the mage who casts it. But\u2026yes\u201d\nshe says. She hesitates a little longer. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s the\nproblem that if they die, the information we want dies with them\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf nod. They\u2019ve experienced this before; their master is\nalways most displeased when they kill a traitor too early, before all\nthe information they contain has been wrung from them. It\u2019s a\ndelicate process. \n</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026But\ntheoretically at least, one could bring them back an unlimited number\nof times. Now, getting information out is not a trivial problem\neither, as resurrection does not always leave the mind and memories\nintact\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u201d\nsays Caleb, nodding. \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\nit\u2019s something that Master Ikithon said is an area ripe for future\nexperimentation. Maybe if we collect enough data, I will even be\nallowed to make a presentation of my findings before the next sitting\nof the Cerberus Assembly!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAstrid,\nthat is wonderful.\u201d Eodwulf raises an eyebrow, eyes fixed on her\nface. \n</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\ncongratulations!\u201d Caleb grins, then falters, when he sees Eodwulf\nlooking at Astrid strangely.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre\u2026are\nyou all right?\u201d he asks; it is true, she is not looking quite as\nhappy about about the prospect as perhaps she should be. \n</p>\n<p>He\nwonders what is going through her mind, but restrains himself from\ncasting a simple Detect Thoughts to try to find out. He thinks he can\nguess some of it, anyway.</p>\n<p>She\nlooks up at him, and Caleb sees something run between the two of\nthem, some calculation that he is not quite a party too, but thinks\nhe understands at least partially too. \u201cYes\u201d Astrid says, going\nback to her bloody tunic, with a determined smile. \u201cYes, I am\nfine.\u201d</p>\n<hr><p>Master\nIkithon brings them to Rexxentrum with him, sometimes. Truly to the\ncity in a beautiful coach with horses, rather than just through the\nportal to the dungeons. \n</p>\n<p>(That\nis, after all, a different world.) \n</p>\n<p>He\nwants to show them off, this best and brightest, and the knowledge\nmakes Caleb\u2019s heart flutter with troublesome nerves. Caleb squashes\nthem resolutely; this is too important to allow his fear to get in\nthe way.</p>\n<p>Getting\ndressed for the occasion helps. They wear stiff formal uniforms for\nofficial visits, imperial black and gold with red trim, buttoned up\nto the neck and tied with heavy and complex sashes and pinned with a\nbeautiful golden brooch that is probably worth more than several\nyears\u2019 worth of his parents\u2019 wages on its own, he thinks. Things\nlike this occur to him sometimes; it\u2019s always a strangely\ndisorientating moment, when they do. \n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\nall right, though; when he\u2019s a real mage working for the Empire,\nwith a position of his own, then he\u2019ll be able to send them all the\nmoney they could ever want. \n</p>\n<p>He\nlikes that thought.</p>\n<hr><p>They\ndance, sometimes. Caleb is not good at it \u2013 easily the worst of the\nthree \u2013 but he is getting better. Astrid is a good dancer; she has\nloved it since she was a child, twirling in a yellow dress at Harvest\nClose in Blumenthal. But now she has learned refinement, quickly\npicking up the steps to dances that the nobles of Rexxentrum favour. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nwas always timid, before, but he is learning to dance too. Since the\ntime he almost broke, he has been less afraid, less conflicted. More\npoised, appearing older even though he is the youngest of the three. \n</p>\n<p>Now,\nEodwulf and Caleb sit on the side of the hall, sipping a fizzy, astringent green drink from crystal flutes. They watch Astrid polka\nacross the floor with a beautiful orange tiefling arcanist dressed\nall in flowing white silks. \n</p>\n<p>The\ntwo dance together after a little while, spinning slowly across the\nfloor. Then Caleb dances with Astrid, a little pink-cheeked from the\ndrink and from dancing every dance. She bows to him with an\nexaggerated flourish before going over to Eodwulf and taking his hand\nin hers. \n</p>\n<p>All\nthis makes Caleb feel almost strong enough to socialise a little, as\nthey are supposed to. He knows that the author of a treatise on\nmagical metallurgy and mining techniques that he found so fascinating\nlast year is here, and Caleb has been working up courage to go and\nspeak to him all evening. \n</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can do so, Master Ikithon catches his arm. He looks up,\nsurprised; his master has been deep in conversation with Oremid Hass,\nas well as several other dignitaries whose names Caleb doesn\u2019t\nknow, their faces graver than usual. Something is preparing, maybe.\nAnd so, he is grateful and proud that his master has a moment to\nspare for him.</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon comes close, conspiratorial. \u201cAh, Caleb. Enjoying the\nevening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\nvery much.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\ngives Caleb a long, calculating look, then nods, patting him on the\nshoulder approvingly, steering him towards the group of dignitaries\nin the corner. \u201cGood. Now, go and do what you\u2019re here for\u2026you\nwon\u2019t be a student forever, and the world must know your face. Do\nnot disappoint me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf\ncourse not!\u201d \n</p>\n<p>And\nin that moment, he resolves to keep that promise as much as he can,\nwith everything he has to give.</p>\n<hr><p>Their\nmaster has been away a lot recently; there is trouble in the capital,\nrumours of traitors high up within the Cerberus Assembly. Rogue\nmages, making off with important state secrets. Caleb and the others\ndon\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but their master seems troubled. Not\nthat they have much time to wonder, as their workload is increasing.</p>\n<p>Even\nwhile he is away on business to Rexxentrum though, Master Ikithon\nwill meet them in the dungeons under the city; he has taught them to\nopen the portal under the conservatory themselves, a great honour and\na great weight of responsibility. They are undertaking more and more\nof the interrogations on their own, too. \n</p>\n<p>It\nbecomes almost routine, even a welcome respite from the rest of their\nwork.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon; they are all nervous, and tensions run high.\nAstrid and Eodwulf fight over nothing, and do not speak for a week,\nand Caleb is miserable and frustrated the whole time acting as their\nintermediary. They make up in tears, a little later, and it is a\nrelief, but the pressure remains. Astrid takes to constantly\nreorganising her collection of poisons, the little bottles\nmeticulously labeled and cataloged. Eodwulf paces their sitting\nroom in front of the fire, eyes half closed, lips moving slightly as\nhe runs through spells in his mind. Caleb finds himself writing\neverything down, even more so than before; it helps him to organise\nhis thoughts, but his room is awash with paper, stacks and piles of\nit, going through pots of ink and pens at an alarming rate.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon, their master says; sooner than they expected,\nbut their master needs them to reach their full potential sooner\nrather than later. He needs to have them trained soon, so that they\ncan aid him at his side, fully within his trust. \n</p>\n<p>No\nlonger students, but full members of the highest circle of mages in\nthe Empire. \n</p>\n<p>The\nprospect is both unnerving and exhilarating. Caleb thinks about how\nproud his parents will be, and it only makes him push himself harder.</p>\n<p>And\nso they study, and study more, and practice and prepare themselves.\nThere will be a final test of their abilities, they all know. Their\nmaster has not told them what it is yet, but they throw all of their\nstrength and academic abilities into preparing, into becoming\nstronger and cleverer. Caleb goes to bed each night exhausted, his\nmind thrumming with spells and lists and facts and incantations, and\nsometimes the screams of the traitors in the dungeons. Sometimes\nEodwulf or Astrid are with him, pressed close in the dark, or falling\nasleep over their work in front of the fireplace.</p>\n<p>And\nthen, one day, their master comes to them with an announcement. They\nlook at each other with trepidation in their eyes; could this be it?</p>\n<p>But\nno; Master Ikithon surprises them with the gift of some time off. He\ntells them he is giving them two weeks to return to Blumenthal and\ntheir families, once more before they graduate and assume positions\nin Rexxentrum. \n</p>\n<p>He\ntells them to enjoy the time, as afterwards their lives will change\nentirely. \n</p>\n<p>(Caleb\ndoesn\u2019t understand until later how true that statement is.)</p>\n<p>Before\nthey go, he wishes them each farewell with his strange blessing, one\nlast time. Master Ikithon\u2019s fingers feel warm against Caleb\u2019s\ntemple under the lightest of touches. The words sound familiar, an\necho of the years they have spent, of all the work and all of\nthemselves that they have given. A binding of their hearts to his\nmind, the three of them trusting their teacher implicitly. \u201cStay\non this path and don\u2019t turn aside, and it will take you far.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\nhold hands, all three in a row, as they begin their journey home.</p></p>",

They are just children, at the beginning.</p><p>At\nthe end, they are something else entirely. \n</p><p>They\nare eleven years old and they are friends already, even before they\nare accepted into the Academy. Even before they meet the man who will\nsee something special in them, pluck them from amongst its ranks of\nbrilliance, of students who hold promise. \n</p><p>The\nnight they find out they will all be going together, Eodwulf and\nCaleb sneak out of their homes, climbing the tree in Astrid&rsquo;s\nfamily&rsquo;s garden. There is a rickety little treehouse up there, and\nthe three of them sit and look at the stars until the dawn comes.\nIt&rsquo;s summer, and it&rsquo;s warm even in these cool northern latitudes,\nand the night is fragrant and bright with possibility.</p><p>After\nall, everything they could have possibly wanted and more is before\nthem; they need only reach out and take it.</p><hr /><p>Blumenthal\nhas never had three of its children honoured so; they throw a\nfestival for them in the village square, a sent-off party one long\nnight near the end of summer. They all wear their best. Someone has\ngiven Eodwulf a crown of pink flowers. It suits him; he has dark skin\nand black hair, and the colour looks good against it, Caleb thinks.\nThe crown&rsquo;s a little too big and falls down over one eye as he\ngrins shyly at the others. Someone grabs Astrid&rsquo;s arm and puts one\non her too. It&rsquo;s yellow, matching her golden-brown skin, her mane\nof hair the colour of old, dusty gold woven into a long braid. She\npushes her thick, wire-rimmed glasses up her nose and squares her\nshoulders in determination, as though she is carrying the full weight\nand responsibility of a true crown. \n</p><p>Caleb\nhas a crown too; his is blue as the summer sky, and the pollen and\nthe scent makes him sneeze a little as a few petals fall down over\nhis face.</p><p>He\nwears it all evening, taking it off at night and laying it on his\nbedside table when he goes to sleep in his own bed for the last time.\nHe will return to Blumenthal, he knows this. But he&rsquo;s not sure that\nit will ever feel like home anymore, with the bright future stretched\nout before him, the path just waiting for him to walk down it.</p><hr /><p>They\nhave been at the academy for a few years when they are told that they\nhave been chosen to be taught privately by Master Trent Ikithon.\nThey&rsquo;ve actually heard of him before; whispers abound, he&rsquo;s one\nof the greatest arcanists in the whole Empire, he&rsquo;s uniquely\ncommitted to both the defence of the realm and the training of the\nmost talented young mages, the best and brightest. He&rsquo;s tough, it&rsquo;s\nrumoured; he will not take anything other than the very best, and he\nwill punish failure harshly. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nEodwulf and Astrid cannot stop grinning, as they pack up their few\npossessions for the journey. They know, after all, that if they are\ntogether then they are three times as strong, three times as clever\nand talented. \n</p><p>The\nfact that all of them were chosen is proof enough of that.</p><hr /><p>They\neach have their own strengths, and they must find them and train\nthem; that is Master Ikithon&rsquo;s very first lesson. \n</p><p>After\nhe takes them into his tutelage, the first two weeks are spent\nassessing their individual abilities. He has their files and progress\nreports from the Academy, of course, the records of the scholarships\nthey were each awarded, letters of recommendation, signed and sealed.\nHe barely touches the files; just as he picked them out, he tells\nthem he prefers to use his own experience with such things, to see\nwith his own eyes. They should too, he says; doing so will make it\neasier for them to bring out their full magical potential. \n</p><p>(They\nall have so much potential; it&rsquo;s something all three of them have\nknown for years now, but somehow when Master Ikithon says it it holds\nall the more promise. It makes them want to prove him right, to show\nhim what they are, and what they can be.)</p><p>They\nwill each complete their full, comprehensive education in history,\nreligion, a variety of languages both common and rare, mathematics,\nrhetoric, politics, natural philosophy, and of course magic. But in\nthis last, they must choose the areas they want to specialise in. \n</p><p>Most\nmages, Master Ikithon tells them, wait until later on in their\neducation to choose a school of magic to specialise in. <i>But you\nthree</i>, he says, smiling at them, <i>are not most mages</i>. They\nare the very brightest young minds in the Empire, and his course of\nstudy will be duly accelerated and advanced. And so they will each\npick a school of magic &ndash; or two if they choose, as ambition is to\nbe encouraged - to study, according to their strengths and their\ninterests once they discover them. They will have to work hard, he\nwarns them; they are not here for an easy few years. But if they\napply themselves then they will rise amongst the ranks of the\nAcademy, then go on to defend the Empire, and who knows to what\nheights they will ascend? \n</p><p>It\nis what they all want, more than anything. \n</p><p>And\nso, their new master spends some time assessing them. Already it is\nhard, demanding work. He has them show him to spells they already\nknow, subjects them to written tests and interviews them at length\nabout their interests, their hopes and dreams and aspirations. \n</p><p>Eventually,\nthe specialisations are chosen. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nwill study the school of illusion magic, with a secondary focus on\nenchantment. The two can be much greater than the sum of their parts\nwhen used together, their master tells Eodwulf, as he reports it back\nto Caleb and Astrid. It is no small thing to be able to look at a\nperson and enchant them so that they spill out the secret they keep\nlocked deep in their heart, especially if the knowledge can then be\nused to spin them an illusion that can either heal or break them. It\nis hard, on a personal level; this much, Master Ikithon acknowledges.\nBut he believes that Eodwulf can handle it, given proper guidance. \n</p><p>When\nEodwulf tells him this, Caleb agrees, and is happy for him; Eodwulf\nwas always the most empathetic of them, a sensitive and intensely\ncreative child. There is a small, hopeful spark in Eodwulf&rsquo;s eyes,\nand Caleb is happy for his friend.</p><p>(Caleb\nremembers the older boys who would hurt Eodwulf as a child, would\ntake turns trying to make him cry just because it was easy, because\nthey could. Eodwulf had always hated being so beholden to them, and\nCaleb supposes this is his way of fighting back, many years too\nlate.)</p><p>Astrid\ncomes and tells them that she has chosen to study necromancy, with\nconjuration. Caleb is surprised for a moment, until he thinks about\nit a little more, and then he&rsquo;s not. Master Ikithon, she explains,\nallowed her a little more choice in what she wanted to study. He had\njudged her the most resilient and hardworking of the three, stable of\nmind and always meticulous. Too many who have had the power to\ncontrol others, to bend the powers of life and death to their will,\nhave fallen off the righteous path, he tells Astrid. But that only\nmakes mages who can control these forces all the more valuable to the\nEmpire, and with her level-headed calm and emotional toughness, he\nbelieves that she is able to handle it. Conjuration, too, takes a\nsteadier hand and an even temperament to get right. \n</p><p>(Caleb\nwonders if Master Ikithon looked deeply enough into all their pasts\nto be aware that Astrid&rsquo;s brother died the winter he was four and\nshe was nine. She had nearly died too, but she had held on long\nenough by days for the snow to melt and the way to be clear for the\nmedicine to come from the capital to cure her. Since then, she has\nboth feared and been fascinated by death beyond anything else. Caleb\nwonders if this was behind her choice. He does not tell Master\nIkithon this; it&rsquo;s not his to tell, and he is not asked. He\nsupposes it is likely he knows anyway, though.)</p><p>Caleb\nis called last; he will be specialising jointly in transmutation and\nevocation. A true joint specialisation is a difficult task, not for\nthe complacent. Master Ikithon tells him that he is proud of him, and\nCaleb feels his face glow bright with satisfaction; compliments, from\ntheir master, are rare and precious. \n</p><p>But\nCaleb, his master says, has not only the strongest academic record\nbut also the most raw arcane power underneath it. Transmutation &ndash;\nhis own particular area of expertise, no less &ndash; is a natural fit\nfor the academically gifted, as it requires a great deal of knowledge\nof substances, the non-magical basis of chemistry, of alchemy and the\ncomposition of things as they occur naturally in order to understand\nthe fundamental laws that govern the changing of one thing into\nanother. And Caleb will be learning the rigourous first principles;\nMaster Ikithon does not believe in a superficial approach to magical\neducation, and with transmutation in particular a solid grounding is\nvital. \n</p><p>And\nthen he will learn evocation. Here, there comes a warning. Many\npeople think, his teacher tells him, that evocation is all raw,\nuntamed power, righteous fire and destruction. But it is also one of\nthe most dangerous schools of magic for the caster; a good grasp of evocation magic\nis far more about learning control and mastery, lest the power the\nmage wields consume them. Fire, in the right hands, he tells Caleb,\nis as much a creative force as a destructive one.</p><p>He\ntells Caleb that if anyone can wield that power, it is him.</p><p>At\nthe time, Caleb glows with ecstatic joy, and immediately throws\nhimself into his studies.</p><hr /><p>(It\ndoes not occur to Caleb until many, many years later that it was\nperhaps no coincidence that none of them were chosen to study\ndivination or abjuration. Seeing through illusions to the truth of\nthings, and evading and defending against magical attacks&hellip; at the\ntime, Caleb though what the others thought, that this was far less\nexciting for a young mage who was set to go far than magic that could\nbe used to attack. Besides, he didn&rsquo;t think that it was any of\ntheir strengths, and surely he could trust his teacher to be able to\nsee the truth of that from the beginning.)</p><p>(It\nonly strikes him so many years later, but he is a different person by\nthen, a whole new life of broken, jagged pieces replacing the shining\nbright one that he had imagined.)</p><hr /><p>They\ncome to think of their master&rsquo;s house as home. The house is a\nbeautiful one, out in the country, away from the bustle and\npoliticking of Rexxentrum. The mountains march far off in the\ndistance, but the house itself is in a sheltered, green valley, a\nlittle warmer and more sundrenched than the city of marble and metal\nand slate, however grand and elegant it may be to Caleb&rsquo;s eyes. \n</p><p>Caleb\nloves everything about the valley and their master&rsquo;s house there.\nHe loves the way that the grass ripples and waves in the wind as they\ncome down the mountain road from the pass in their coach, and he\nloves the pear trees that grow in the sheltered garden. He loves the\nlibrary above all; being surrounded by so many books is a blessing he\nhasn&rsquo;t yet come to take for granted and probably never will.\nThere&rsquo;s so many of them, three levels with beautifully carved and\ndark-polished rolling ladders so he doesn&rsquo;t need to ask anyone if\nhe wants the highest ones. If he&rsquo;s got no other work to do, he can\njust sit there and read all day, in the reading room where the sun\nfilters down in stripes through the half-shuttered windows with their\ncomfortably-upholstered alcoves. If he wants, he can sit in a window\nseat curled up with a book for hours, and no one will tell him to go\nand do his chores instead because this is his <i>life</i> now, it&rsquo;s\nall part of his studies and besides, his master is rich enough to\nhave household servants who go about on quiet feet. There&rsquo;s also a\nwhole walk-in store cupboard of common spell components, which he can\njust take anything from; more dangerous or valuable components are\nkept personally by Master Ikithon, but Caleb knows he only has to ask\nfor it and tell his master why he needs it, and it will be his. \n</p><p>He\nloves that he and Eodwulf and Astrid have rooms next to each other,\nall three in a row. Their rooms open onto a little common sitting\nroom, with a cozy fireplace that they share. In the evenings, after\ndining with their master when he is there, or alone when he is away\non business in Rexxentrum or Zadash, they usually go back there and\ncurl up together on one of the soft chairs. Sometimes, they speak\nabout magic, and their studies, one or other of them showing the\nothers a new spell they&rsquo;ve learned with pride, or working through\nsomething they&rsquo;ve been finding difficult to master. Sometimes,\nthough, they just talk, their faces lit by the warm light of the\nfire. They grow close; they were close before of course, Blumenthal\nwas a small village and they&rsquo;ve all known each other for most of\ntheir lives, have seen each other grow up. But now, they grow closer\nthan they had ever thought possible, sharing their hopes and dreams\nfor the bright future they are bound for. \n</p><p>They\nare all homesick, from time to time. But none of them speak of it;\nthey don&rsquo;t need to, and besides, even to give voice to such a\nthought would feel wrong, ungrateful. \n</p><p>Besides,\nthey have each other, and as long as the three are together then to\nwhatever greatness they come, they will each always have that little\npiece of their history, reminding them where they came from.</p><p>It\ndoes not occur to any of them that there might come a time when the\nthree of them will not be together. It seems unthinkable, then.</p><hr /><p>As\nwell as the lessons that Master Ikithon teaches them all together &ndash;\ntheir general studies, and the magical theory and basic spells that\nevery mage should know &ndash; they each have private lessons, once a\nweek for two hours. These sessions take place in Master Ikithon&rsquo;s\nbrightly lit study, with its wide windows looking out onto the\ngarden, books and wood panelling covering the other three walls.\nCaleb loves these lessons; he sits in a chair at the other side of\nMaster Ikithon&rsquo;s desk, and his teacher asks him about what he has\nbeen learning that week. The three students spend a lot of time\nreading alone, and it is wonderful to be able to talk about what he\nreads, to ask questions of someone who actually knows the answers. As\na child, Caleb would read every book he could get his hands on, but\nno one in Blumenthal ever had the time or the knowledge for a proper\ndiscussion.</p><p>His\nteacher does. He sits calmly on the other side of his desk, sometimes\nasking a question that is designed to puzzle, to challenge;\nsometimes, Caleb can&rsquo;t answer them, but that only makes him more\ndetermined to find the answer by the next time. He is meticulous, he\nlikes to get them right; if he makes mistakes, Master Ikithon gets a\nlook of disappointment, a frown line deepening between his eyes,\nwhich grow a little colder. He is the sort of person that makes one\nfeel they must not disappoint.</p><p>After\ntheir discussion, they usually practice some magic; Caleb is learning\nspells as fast as he can, his fingers perpetually stained with ink\nfrom copying them down into one of his many notebooks. He always\nfeels a flicker of nervousness before showing them off though; Master\nIkithon is strong, stronger than any mage in the whole Empire, maybe.\n\n</p><p>He\ndoes not stand for failure in this, either. Magic, Master Ikithon\nsays, when used in the real world, can easily strike down the caster\nif handled incorrectly. It is not a toy but a tool, a weapon, and\nmust be treated as such. \n</p><p>Clumsiness\nand carelessness are thus punished severely. \n</p><p>Caleb\nlets a fireball slip from his control one summer morning as the light\nstreams in the window. It begins to disappate in the air, arcane fire\nsending distortions crackling upwards into the sunlit air above, and\nhe panics, sliding on the carpet to try to grasp the fire again, to\ncatch it back in his fist like a trapped bird. But instead of bending\nto his will, the fire slips from his grasp once more, flaring bright\nbefore vanishing to nothing. \n</p><p>A\nfew papers drift off Master Ikithon&rsquo;s desk in the downdraft, a\nlittle singed at one edge. They glow but do not catch. Nevertheless\nthey are a little blackened by the time they reach the carpet. \n</p><p>Caleb\nstares at them, his eyes wide as he looks up to meet his master&rsquo;s;\nsure enough, there is that disappointed look, that slight tightening\nof the mouth, and Caleb&rsquo;s feels as though his heart were tearing in\ntwo. \n</p><p>There\nare punishments, on days like this. \n</p><hr /><p>Caleb\nis back in their common room, laying a rag soaked in a healing potion\non the deep gouges on his upper arm; arcane blades bite deeper than\nthe regular kind, and the pain takes longer to subside. Still, he can\ntake it. As his master says, he is strong, stronger than the others.\nHe deserved this; he&rsquo;s learned from it. \n</p><p>He\nclenches his fist experimentally, the pain running up his whole\nlacerated arm. The healing potion must be doing its work. When the\ncuts were fresh, he would have been screaming just trying to move his\nfingers, with the tear and burn of ruined skin, gashes deep enough to\ncatch the tendons in his wrist.</p><p>Caleb\ntakes a new rag, dips it in the potion and applies it to his skin. It\nis soothing and tingles a little. \n</p><p>There\nis a store room just for healing potions; they go through many, many\nof them. Their master will be angry with them, after all, if they\nallow his punishments to leave a scar, and so only magical healing\nwill do. After all, to scar them is not his goal. His punishments, he\ntakes pains to tell them, are for the purposes of teaching only. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon is not an inhumane person, after all. He is too indulgent to\nhis students, some at the Academy may even say.</p><p>Caleb\nsighs, looking over at the torn and bloody sleeve of his shirt that\nhe has taken off to clean and heal his arm. He must wash and mend the\nshirt; it was one he brought from home, after all. \n</p><p>Just\nthen, the door opens and in come Astrid and Eodwulf, midway through a\ndiscussion on the differences in casting gestures for holy and arcane\ncasting. Astrid wrote an assigned essay on it last week, and she is\nexplaining it to Eodwulf. \n</p><p>When\nthey see Caleb, they immediately break off speaking. They do not have\nto say anything; this is familiar, a ritual even. Astrid sighs,\nsympathetic, lays a hand on his shoulder in wordless support. Eodwulf\nsits down on the chair next to Caleb, taking the cloth from him and\nbeginning to wash the wounds. Caleb nods gratefully; the wounds are\nnearly fully healed now, the skin visibly knitting together to its\nusual pale, freckled smoothness again, but he appreciates the\ncloseness. Astrid sits down on his other side, heedless of the fact\nthat the deep armchair is only really meant for one, and begins to\ncast prestidigitation to clean Caleb&rsquo;s bloody shirt. After she is\nfinished, she casts mending, and at once it is good as new. By this\ntime, Eodwulf is finished healing Caleb&rsquo;s wounds, and the remaining\ndregs of the potion in the dish and the cloth are pink with blood,\nbut his arm is back to normal.</p><p><i>Good</i>.\nHe will need to be able to practice his spells, he thinks. He must\nbecome stronger, so he does not disappoint Master Ikithon again.</p><p>But\nnot quite yet. The others hold him between them, again an unspoken\nritual. They lean close; they both know that it helps him in moments\nlike this, to have the physicality and the grounding of it. They both\nunderstand, as if it&rsquo;s not him its one of them. \n</p><p>He\nis pressed between the two of them, and at long last, he begins to\nshake and sob, even though the pain is gone. Somehow, being so close\nto them allows him to let himself cry, and he does, dampening the\nshoulder of Astrid&rsquo;s shirt with his tears of pain and humiliation,\nas she holds him and Eodwulf strokes his hair. \n</p><p>They\nsit there until the sun goes down, and eventually, Caleb has calmed\ntoo, the pain replaced by weariness as he begins to doze, and finally\nthe tremble in his hands is stilled. \n</p><hr /><p>Most\nof the time though, his private lessons do not end like this. If\nMaster Ikithon is happy with his work, then there will be a rare,\nbenevolent smile, a word of praise even. And there is something else\ntoo; a ritual, that comes at the end of the meeting. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon sits him down, and lays two gentle fingers on the side of\nCaleb&rsquo;s head, just at his temple, then briefly on the other side.\nIt feels almost like a blessing, a benediction. There is magic in\nthat touch, but it is so subtle that Caleb can barely detect it, let\nalone understand it. Not that he spends much time questioning it; the\ntruth that his master has his best interests at heart is one that he\nholds closer than any other, and Caleb trusts him implicitely.</p><p>&ldquo;Very\ngood, Caleb. You did well today.&rdquo; And then, the words with which\nhis master always ends their meetings: &ldquo;stay on this path and don&rsquo;t\nturn aside, and it will take you far.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>(There\nare things that don&rsquo;t match up, sometimes. Because he is very\nperceptive, Caleb notices them occasionally, just. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s\neveryday things; he will find himself more often in the situation\nwhere he walks through a door and forgets why. Other times, it&rsquo;s a\nlittle harder to dismiss; he will find himself at the end of a\ncorridor without remembering having walked there, or there will be a\nbloodstain on his cuff that is just a little bit too large to be from\na papercut, even if he remembered getting one.)</p><p>(If\nhe had asked Master Ikithon about these occurrances, they would have\nbeen waved away with a kind smile, advice to get a little more sleep\nat night if he finds himself forgetting things, so that he may\ncontinue to excel in his studies.)</p><p>(In\nthe event though, Caleb mentions nothing of these lapses; he doesn&rsquo;t\neven tell Astrid and Eodwulf, let alone his master. He wouldn&rsquo;t\nwant to be thought of as weak or falling behind after all, or worse,\nunworthy of his master&rsquo;s teaching.)</p><hr /><p>Astrid\nhas been working on a particular spell; her hands are dusted black\nwith charcoal when she bursts out of her room to show Caleb and\nEodwulf, who are sitting back to back and studying by the fire. They\nboth look up when she enters the room, the scent of incense drifting\nafter her in a swirling cloud, a proud grin on her face. \n</p><p>On\none arm she wears one of the thick, slightly scorched and stained\nleather gloves that they wear sometimes for their alchemy lessons. \n</p><p>On\nher gloved hand stands a sparrow hawk, feathers a little ruffled but\neyes bright, immediately swivelling to catch the two of them in its\ngaze.</p><p>Eodwulf&rsquo;s\neyes widen. &ldquo;Is that&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nmy own familiar!&rdquo; Astrid&rsquo;s eyes are shining with pride, bright as\nthe hawk&rsquo;s. &ldquo;His name is Hieronymus.&rdquo;</p><p>Eodwulf\nraises an eyebrow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really thought this through, haven&rsquo;t\nyou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely.\nI love him already.&rdquo;</p><p>The\nbird caws, as though in agreement, and cocks his sleek feathered head\ntowards Astrid&rsquo;s. \n</p><p>Hieronymus\nbecomes a part of their lives, for a while. Astrid changes his form\noften; not long after she first summons him she gathers the\ncomponents she needs once again, and experiments with the form of a\nbearded dragon, then an adder. For a few months he is often found\ncurled around Astrid&rsquo;s arm or around her neck, gently scenting the\nair with his little forked tongue as she studies in the light of the\nlamp. Then he is a mouse, then a cat, a raven, and, for a few\nmemorable days, an octopus, living in the pond outside in the garden.\nAstrid loves Hieronymus, changing his form to indulge him, she\ndeclares. \n</p><p>Caleb,\nwatching them together, thinks that it helps Astrid, to have him\nthere. When he is in a form with fur, her fingers are always\nstroking, touching it. When he is a serpent, she winds her hand\naround his tail lazily as she thinks. \n</p><p>It\nhelps her though, and for that, Caleb is glad. \n</p><hr /><p>Master\nIkithon is a good teacher, but a hard one, and as they have grown\nstronger he has only asked more of them; they are not children, not\nanymore, and they must learn mental fortitude. They must learn not to\nlet themselves be held hostage by their feelings, never to let pity\nget in the way of doing what must be done.</p><p>When\none of them fails, now the others suffer too. \n</p><p>When\none of them fails, they must test their mettle to prove to him that\nthey are still worthy of his training, he says, with logic that none\nof them can argue with. They must work through some of the more\nunpleasant but sadly necessary sides of keeping the Empire safe and\nfree of traitors. \n</p><p>They\nmust prove their faith by demonstrating their latest achievements on\nthe others. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis screaming, as Astrid&rsquo;s spell strikes him in the chest with a\ncrackling, paralysing ray of dark necrotic energy. He can feel it\ndraining his life force, setting his stomach to churning and cold\nsweat beading on his brow as his vision tunnels. He gasps, as nausea\nwashes over him and ugly black blemishes crawl their way up his arms.</p><p>He\nis on his hands and knees and he can see Astrid, through the hair\nthat has fallen over his eyes. She is standing with her hand\nextended, still channeling the last of the spell. Her teeth are\ngritted, her eyes fixed on him with that forced detachment that they\nall know. Some hair has come loose from her braid at the front, the\nsheen of sweat sticking it to her brow the only signal that betrays\nhow much effort it is taking her to maintain this, to watch Caleb\nwrithe on the floor and not turn aside. Master Ikithon stands behind\nher, Eodwulf on the other side, his hands clasped tight enough to\ndrain the blood from the knuckles as he watches. \n</p><p>Caleb\ndoes not look up, at either Astrid or Eodwulf. He knows from\nexperience that eye contact only makes the it harder for them. If he\nlooks up, it will go on longer, and he does not want them to suffer\nanymore. \n</p><p>It\nwas only a small mistake that she made; just a slight slip in one of\nher spells, but she had wasted a diamond with an ill-cast spell.\nMaster Ikithon is teaching her to be careful with components, a\nlesson that the three of them have never had any pressing need to\nlearn, though an important one. \n</p><p>She\nis being made an example of, and they all know it. Caleb kneels\nretching and convulsing on the floor and wishing he could take her\npain on himself, too. Eodwulf, his face bloodless and his eyes wide\nwith paralysed, forced stillness, is thinking the same, Caleb knows. \n</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;No,\nslower. You must <i>control</i> the flames, the heat. Keep the water\njust short of the boil for now.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb\ngrits his teeth and nods at his teacher, laying his palm just shy of\nflat under the base of the copper tank. Heating slowly has never been his strong point, and Master Ikithon has a way of picking out the little\nimperfections in his casting technique, of making him practice them\nuntil they are no longer imperfections. \n</p><p>He\nallows a thin sheet of flame to coat his palm, heating the water from\nbeneath, and focuses on control. The goal of the exercise is to heat\nthe water as slowly as possible; it should take an hour at the very\nleast to bring it to the boil. \n</p><p>They&rsquo;ve\npracticed with wax, tar and oil before, which are more forgiving,\ntaking more heat before they are bubbling and frothing at the boil.\nWater requires a lighter touch, the greatest mastery of the flow of\nheat through his fingers. \n</p><p>Still,\nhis teacher said he was ready and Caleb is determined to prove him\nright.</p><hr /><p>He\nmasters it, in the end. He shows Astrid and Eodwulf proudly, keeping\nAstrid&rsquo;s old copper tea-kettle hot for hours with the slow heat\nfrom his palm. The tea is far too strong and bitter by the end, but\nthe other two drink it, loyally and proudly, as the cold edges into\nthe room. It&rsquo;ll be the first frost of the year tonight, after all;\nfire and warmth and company are all comforting.</p><p>Caleb\nis still buoyed up by the excitement of learning a new spell late\ninto the night, and so it does not occur to him then that this is not\nthe only way that such a skill could be used. \n</p><hr /><p>They\nare losing the Zemnian accents to their words, slowly. \n</p><p>At\nthe beginning, of course, they used to speak Zemnian amongst\nthemselves. Now, though, they speak Common increasingly; they&rsquo;ve\ngrown accustomed to it. Sometimes, one of them will forget a word &ndash;\nAstrid snapping her fingers in frustration as she tries to think of\nit, or Eodwulf pulling a face, a self-deprecating laugh and and a\nquick mime, a gesture in the air. <i>You know&hellip;that thing</i>. \n</p><p>Caleb\nis not usually the one who forgets. But whenever it happens, it is an\nunspoken agreement that the others will hurry to supply the missing\nword. Especially if they are speaking to Master Ikithon. His\nimpression of them and their conduct matters, of course, above all\nothers. \n</p><p>(He\nnever quite ordered them not to use their mother tongue; not in so\nmany words. But, they all know, it wouldn&rsquo;t do for him to think\nthat any of them wants to exclude him, for then he might think that\nthey have something to hide; then he might think them ungrateful.)</p><p>(Besides,\nthey are growing more comfortable with Common, aren&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s\ngood practice, they each think. Practice for those bright-shining\nfutures that are laid before their feet.)</p><p>Later\nthey learn other languages, too; they learn Sylvan, and Caleb loves\nthe way the syllables sound on his tongue. He&rsquo;s good at languages;\nhe seems to pick them up easier than the others, as he does most\nthings. They learn Celestial, and it&rsquo;s harder but more rewarding;\nthe grammar is strange to Caleb, all complex noun inflections like\nhe&rsquo;s never heard. He masters it too, in the end, spends nights\nreading ancient tomes just for the thrill of it, just because he can.\n\n</p><p>(He\nand Eodwulf and Astrid speak it sometimes to each other, taking a\nquiet thrill in speaking the language of the Gods. It feels right,\nsomehow. For are the three of them not bright with possibility? These\ngolden three can do anything they set their minds to, even scraping\nthe stars, with Master Ikithon to guide them there of course.)</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Caleb,\nEodwulf, look what I can do!&rdquo; \n</p><p>They\nboth rush over, to see what Astrid has done. They find her at the\ntable, and on the table are three small white objects. They are about\nto ask what they are, when Eodwulf draws in a breathy gasp; Caleb\nrecognises what is going on at the same moment.</p><p>They\nare three dead mice, fresh blood staining the fur around their noses\nand mouths. \n</p><p>Astrid\nraises a hand over the mice, and a moment later their bodies are\ntwitching grotesquely, a motion that is life-like, he supposes, but\nsomehow just a little bit off. A moment later, the twitching is\ngrowing stronger, and then the mice are moving, flipping upwards onto\nall fours and then each standing up on their hind legs in a way that\nis utterly different to any living mouse Caleb has ever seen.</p><p>Astrid\nwiggles her fingers, and the mice begin to dance. As they do she\nlooks up at the two of them proudly. Hieronymus is a snake again,\nand he curls over one of her shoulders, tongue lashing out hungrily.\nBut she pushes him back, staying fiercely focussed on the mice on the\ntable in front of her. They leave tiny, bloody smudges of footprints\non the wood of the tabletop.</p><p>It\nis a disturbing sight, but in that moment, Astrid looks so proud and\nhappy, the mere sight makes Caleb&rsquo;s heart sing. \n</p><hr /><p>(There\nare no forbidden books in the library; what there are are books that\nhis mind slides away from, eyes that usually take in every detail\ngliding over their titles without taking them in. Luckily though,\nthese books are not on his reading lists, so it does not impact his\nstudies in any way.)</p><hr /><p>Behind\nthe house there is a garden, and in the garden, there is a\nconservatory. The conservatory is bright and spacious, with wicker\nchairs and hanging baskets of flowers. \n</p><p>In\nthe corner of the conservatory, there is a plain wooden door that\nleads to the garden, and they have never seen it opened. Caleb,\nAstrid and Eodwulf don&rsquo;t think much of it, until they learn that it\ncannot be opened except with a key that Master Ikithon keeps on him\nat all times. \n</p><p>They\nhave been studying with him for about eight months when he first\ntakes them out to the conservatory and unlocks the door. Before they\ncan ask what he is doing, they see the door swing open for the first\ntime. Beyond it, where there should be the garden, there is a stone\nstaircase, a tight spiral lit by magical, ever-burning lamps, going\ndownwards.</p><p>They\nfollow Master Ikithon down the stairs. \n</p><p>The\nspiral goes on for a very long time, longer than Caleb expects;\nthough he&rsquo;s not quite sure if it really goes down so far or even\nhow much time has passed. There might well be some magic in it, a\nsubtle one he doesn&rsquo;t recognise yet. None of them talk on the way\ndown, they just keep following, the three students in a row behind\ntheir teacher.</p><p>Eventually,\nthe staircase ends. There is another locked door, there, and this one\ncertainly is magic; the doorjamb and the door itself seems to thrum\nwith it, though the spell is too powerful for him to have learned\nyet. He casts Detect Magic, discretely; he&rsquo;s in the habit of it, he\nlikes to know things even before Master Ikithon explains them. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb suspected, the door is radiating the bright glow of high-level\nconjuration magic. He looks over at Astrid, sees her frowning as she\nlays a tentative hand on the doorjamb. \n</p><p>Before\nany of them do anything else, though, their master turns to them. In\nthe glow of the magical lights, Master Ikithon&rsquo;s face is cast in\nstark light and shadow. &ldquo;Once we cross this threshold, my bright\nones,&rdquo; he tells them, &ldquo;know that there is a trust between us,\nabove and beyond what has been before.&rdquo; He raises a hand, smiling\nonce again that benevolent, almost fatherly smile, though it is\nsomewhat melancholic now. &ldquo;I know, I have already placed a great\ndeal of trust in you three. And I don&rsquo;t mean to stop now, but there\nare things that you will see and do that require&hellip;some extra\ncommitment, on your parts.&rdquo; He looks steadily at each of them, gaze\npiercing suddenly. Caleb stares determinedly back, holding the look\nuntil it moves on. &ldquo;Can I trust you to do what must be done for the\nEmpire, to never break under pressure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nnods, smiling once more, the sharpness in him gone almost as soon as\nit came. &ldquo;I knew I could.&rdquo;</p><p>And\nwith that, he opens the door for the first time. \n</p><p>As\nCaleb had suspected, the air smells different down here, and the\nchange in temperature and humidity is noticable; it confirms his\nsuspicion that the door is a portal of some kind, to somewhere other\nthan under their master&rsquo;s house. The corridor is not dark,\nprecisely, but it is dim, the magical lights lower here. They are in\na corridor with heavy steel vault doors in rows along each side. \n</p><p>The\ndoor vanishes behind them. Caleb cannot quite suppress a shiver, even\nthough it isn&rsquo;t cold.</p><p>&ldquo;Where\nare we?&rdquo; asks Eodwulf. \n</p><p>&ldquo;We\nare in Rexxentrum, far beneath the citadel and the castle keep.&rdquo;\nMaster Ikithon smiles, mildly. &ldquo;I am your teacher, and teaching\noccupies much of my time these days. But as you may know, I am\ninvolved, in the capacity of&hellip;ah, shall we say, more of a trusted\nconsultant now, in matters of intelligence, and specifically of\nquashing rebellion from within the Empire even before it takes root.&rdquo;\nHe clasps his hands, looks at the three of them standing before him.\n&ldquo;I am most pleased to inform you, my pupils, that you have come far\nenough that the council has allowed me to&hellip;enlist your help with\nthis, in certain ways.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf and Astrid exchange looks of excitement; they have heard\nmuch speculation about their master&rsquo;s role in the Empire, and\nrumours swirl of an exciting life in the keeping of secrets and\nspying, of daring missions to oust traitors. Could it possibly be\ntrue? And are they really being brought in on that noble task?</p><p>&ldquo;To\nwit&rdquo; their teacher continues, continuing to walk them down the\nstone corridor with its ever burning lamps, &ldquo;I have decided that\nnow is the time to begin to train you in the art of negotiation. It\nwill serve you well, to be able to glean more information from a\nperson than you give away, and with the strength of your magic now,\nyou are well on your way to becoming just what the Empire needs to\nmaintain the peace.&rdquo; He stops in front of a great metal-bound door,\ncovered in heavy, complicated locks, both mechanical and glowing with\nthe arcane thrum of spells of locking and warding. He touches a spot\non the door and the locks begin to open one by one, the well-oiled\nslide of steel on steel making almost no noise. After a moment, the\ndoor behind him swings open, revealing another corridor lined with\nheavy locked doors. \n</p><p>Their\nmaster turns around to look at them, hands open towards them.\n&ldquo;Traitors all, in these cells&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Bound to be executed.\nBut it would be a waste to do so without finding out what secrets\nthey can tell us, that we can then use to make the Empire safer,\nwould it not?&rdquo;</p><p>The\nthree nod fervently; it makes sense, as does everything their teacher\nsays. \n</p><p>Master\nIkithon gifts them a rare smile, turning to the corridor. He walks to\na door on the right, opening it to reveal a dwarven woman, dressed in\nrags, her face smeared with blood and grime. She is shackled hand and\nfoot, but it is her eyes that are truly frightening. They seem to\nburn with a cold hatred, an anger and resentment and defiance such as\nCaleb has never seen before. He exchanges looks with Astrid and\nEodwulf, knowing they are having the same thought: <i>this, then, is\nwhat a traitor looks like.</i></p><p>Master\nIkithon, however, seems unfazed, and spreads his hands out to them.\n&ldquo;Then let us begin our first lesson.&rdquo; And with that, he walks\ninto the cell. \n</p><p>He\ndoes not look to see if they are following after; he knows that they\nare. \n</p><hr /><p>The\nsound of screams of pain, inflicted by their own hands, is already\none that is known to them. \n</p><p>It\nbecomes familiar, the more times they return to that dungeon under\nthe earth. It becomes commonplace, even, though when that happened\nnone of them can quite tell. \n</p><hr /><p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf are being punished, today. \n</p><p>Last\nnight they had fallen asleep over their written work together, heads\npillowed on each other&rsquo;s shoulders as they had studied for a test.\nAstrid had come back from a lesson to find them, and she had woken\nthem to keep studying &ndash; knowing, of course, exactly what they would\nwant her to do &ndash; but it had not been enough. They had taken the\ntest in the morning, and Eodwulf had failed. Caleb had scraped a\npassing grade, at least by Academy standards. But then, this is not\nthe academy; only the best is good enough. It is enough to distress\nCaleb terribly; usually, his grades are impeccable, but he has been\nputting in extra work lately, trying to add more and more time in the\ndungeons too. He needs to be stronger, he knows. Less forgiving, less\nmerciful. \n</p><p>Perhaps\nMaster Ikithon knows this, for this time, it is Caleb who is chosen\nto inflict the punishment. \n</p><p>He\nlooks into Eodwulf&rsquo;s eyes as he closes his fingers around his\nfriend&rsquo;s wrist, which is trembling very slightly. <i>Don&rsquo;t show\nfear!</i> Caleb wants to cry out, but he cannot, as his master stands\nbehind him. \n</p><p>Instead\nhe grits his teeth and holds on to Eodwulf&rsquo;s arm, ignites his palm\nand refuses to look away as his dear friend cries out for mercy. The\nsmell of burning skin &ndash; sickeningly familiar, now - begins to fill\nthe room, and Caleb is trembling, but his teacher&rsquo;s shadow is\nbehind him. A little way further back, he is distantly aware of the\nsound of Astrid&rsquo;s muffled sobs. \n</p><p>He\ntells himself that he and Eodwulf deserve this. He tells himself it\nwill be over quickly. Tears spill down his face, but he does not turn\nor look away.</p><p>It\nis over, in the end. Afterwards, when they have been judged to have\nlearned their lesson, Master Ikithon sends them away to the healing\npotion store with benevolent mercy.</p><p>They\nall sleep in Astrid&rsquo;s room that night, curled up on the bed\ntogether, crying until they all have no tears left. \n</p><p>At\nleast until the next time. \n</p><hr /><p>They\nare given leave to return home to Blumenthal for visits,\noccasionally. They travel there for Harvest Close, or a little before\n&ndash; they all know that their parents need the extra pairs of hands to\nhelp with the harvest &ndash; or, sometimes, for Winter&rsquo;s Crest. \n</p><p>This\nis how it is the winter they are sixteen. \n</p><p>(This\nis not the last time they will return, nor the second last. But it is\nthe last that Caleb will be able to remember, from the distance of\nmany years and a broken second life, as truly happy.)</p><p>They\nare at Eodwulf&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; house, and outside the window, snow is\nfalling gently. Their families are all there, as are some of the\nfamilies of the other children they knew, when they really were\nchildren; Caleb shares glances with Astrid and Eodwulf and knows that\nthey are thinking the same thing. How long it&rsquo;s been, how much\nthey&rsquo;ve grown beyond this place. The others that they left behind\nare living in a completely different world, and none of the three\nquite know how they should interact with this place they have left\nbehind. \n</p><p>It&rsquo;s\ncomforting, yes, in the way that home is, all soft colours and\nhalf-remembered voices. It smells like childhood. It&rsquo;s good to hear\nand speak Zemnian again, but if one more person informs Caleb he&rsquo;s\npicked up an accent, he mutters to the other two, he has half a mind\nto just up and leave.</p><p>He\ndoesn&rsquo;t leave, of course. He&rsquo;s finding himself too at ease for\nthat. The night carries on, as the snow falls softly outside. He\ndoesn&rsquo;t always feel at ease, talking to people &ndash; apart from his\nfamily, and Eodwulf and Astrid of course &ndash; but here, tonight, he\ndoes. He mingles around the room, but always he is watching them from\nthe corners of his eye. \n</p><p>Eodwulf\nis spinning illusions for his little cousins, making even the adults\ngasp and praise his skill. The children are positively delighted,\ntheir small hands grabbing at a flight of miniature birds, seven baby\nrabbits hopping across the floor, a dancer in shimmering silks and\nsatins spinning in the centre of the floor to illusory music. Eodwulf\nstands in the centre of it, smiling in that shy way he has when\npeople compliment him, as though he doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. \n</p><p>Astrid\nstands a little way off, clapping and cheering for Eodwulf&rsquo;s\nillusions louder than any of the others. Her eyes catch Caleb&rsquo;s\nacross the room and she grins, beckoning him over to join in. \n</p><p>And\nof course, he goes.</p><p>Later\nin the evening, food is served &ndash; Eodwulf&rsquo;s family always makes\nthe best food, but everyone from the village has brought something to\nshare. There is hot, spiced wine, kept hot above a brazier in a brass\nbowl polished carefully to a mirror shine. Caleb knows what&rsquo;s\ncoming next; he remembers this from his childhood. He wasn&rsquo;t old\nenough then to be given more than a thimbleful, but he had loved to\nwatch anyway. He still does, smiling as Eodwulf&rsquo;s mother places a\nlittle wire shelf above the bowl, a loaf of solid sugar on top of it\nwhich she then soaks in rum. An anticipatory hush falls.</p><p>Then\nshe smiles, strikes a match, and sets it alight. \n</p><p>It\nburns orange for a moment, then bright blue, clear flames rippling\nalong the crystalline surface of the sugar. After a moment it begins\nto melt the sugar, dripping down into the wine. Magical fire is also\nblue sometimes, he finds himself thinking. It looks different though;\nit takes an expert to tell, but he knows fire, now. He knows how it\nbehaves, he knows how to create it and control it, the shapes it\nmakes and how it catches and spreads. \n</p><p>He\nrealises he is daydreaming as his mother touches his shoulder, and\nCaleb feels himself start, then smile, as Astrid elbows her way\nthrough the crowd of people filling the small sitting room, placing a\ncup in his hands. \n</p><p>He\nthanks her as he takes it, feeling the warmth glow against his hands.\nHe sips, enjoying the warmth and sweetness, the spirit already\nbeginning to heat his throat. \n</p><p>Astrid\nwanders off the other side of the room as the party resumes again,\nlouder now. But Caleb hangs back slightly. He is thinking about fire;\nit&rsquo;s true what his teacher says, he thinks, his mind a little warm\nand muzzy with the drink. It&rsquo;s true that fire can create new\nthings, as much as it can destroy. All this&hellip;whatever they do, in\nthat dungeon, it&rsquo;s all for the sake of the citizens of the Empire,\nfor people like these, leading safe lives like the ones the three of\nthem were raised to. It&rsquo;s all to protect them from the threat of\nchaos, of the dark that threatens to destroy them. \n</p><p>And\nin this moment it&rsquo;s absolutely worth it.</p><p>&ldquo;Having\na good time, <i>Erdbeerchen</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb\nblinks, lifting his eyes from his cup at the sound of the childhood\nnickname; he&rsquo;s been gazing down into it for a few minutes now, he\nrealises, and not talking to anyone. <i>Right</i>; he remembers that\nwhen he does that, most people interpret it as him not having a good\ntime. \n</p><p>Not\nhis mother though; she knows him too well. She knows that he can&rsquo;t\nhandle large groups that well, though it&rsquo;s gotten a little easier\nsince he was a child. He looks up at her and smiles. &ldquo;<i>Ja,\nMutti</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>She\nruffles his hair, a scant shade darker red than he own. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;\nShe raises an eyebrow asking for permission and he sighs, nods, lets\nher pull him in for a hug; suddenly he realises that in the time he&rsquo;s\nbeen away, he&rsquo;s grown as tall as she is. She pulls away, holding\nhim by the shoulders and inspecting him with an affectionate but\ncritical eye. He expects her to ask him if he&rsquo;s been using the\nsalve she gave him for his acne last time he was home, or tell him he\nlooks like he hasn&rsquo;t been sleeping enough, or some other such\nthing. But instead she grins, her eyes flicking off the the corner to\nwhere Astrid and Eodwulf are talking, their heads close together over\ntheir cups\nof wine. <br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;Which\none of them is it that makes you look at them like that?&rdquo; his\nmother asks, and Caleb chokes a little, already feeling a blush rise. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You three are so inseparable these days, your father and I are\nhaving trouble telling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah\nno, it&rsquo;s not like that - &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Psh.&rdquo;\nShe smiles, teasing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be embarrassed. It&rsquo;s\nhow it is, at your age, and first love is an excitement\nthat-&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mutti</i>&hellip;\nno, I mean I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d say&hellip;ah&hellip;l-love&hellip;&rdquo;\nthe word burns with possibility in his mouth, but more than that; it\nfeels strange and ill-fitting for what is between them, even\nreductive. It is a given, isn&rsquo;t it, that he loves Eodwulf and\nAstrid? They spend each day together, bound by their destiny, sharing\neverything. But he doesn&rsquo;t think that is the kind of love she\nmeans. He stares determinedly down into his cup, a grown-out lock of\nhair falling over his face. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Caleb.\n<i>Mein liebling</i>. Look at me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He\nflounders, as she leans forward and tucks the hair behind his ear. It\nis an affectionate gesture, but one that also means he has to meet\nher eye. She is merely looking at him with raised eyebrows. &ldquo;Only\nyou can say what you really feel. And that means taking a good hard\nlook at what&rsquo;s in your heart, and not turning away from it.&rdquo; She\nsmiles. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen the way you&rsquo;ve been looking all evening,\nso I think you know already, somewhere in there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He\nsighs, looking back over at Astrid and Eodwulf. Astrid is telling a\nstory, gesturing with her free hand in the air, the firelight dancing\noff her glasses and golden waves of hair that is loose over her\nshoulder for once, unbraided and catching the light in burnished\ngold. Eodwulf is laughing at what she was saying, his cheeks dimpling\nas he smiles. He takes a sip of wine and the apple of his throat bobs\nup and down.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ntakes a drink too, sure his face is on fire now. He turns back to his\nmother, who is stifling laughter. &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You&hellip;you\ndon&rsquo;t have to tell me, you know. Not if you don&rsquo;t want to. Just\nas long as you are being careful and safe&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>M</i><i>utt</i><i>er!</i>&rdquo;\nhe blurts out, wishing he could sink into the floor, as she pats him\nconsolingly on the arm. He sighs, looking down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s\nboth of them, a bit. But it&rsquo;s not like that, with us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She\nnarrows her eyes for a second, and he knows she is reading him,\nseeing that what he says is the truth. She always had placed her\ntrust in him, even as a child. She hums sympathetically, dropping her\nvoice a little for the words she says next. &ldquo;But I think&hellip;you want\nit to be&hellip;or am I wrong?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He\ngrimaces, still half wishing to sink through the floor, but also,\nsurprisingly, finding himself glad to have someone to speak about\nthis with. &ldquo;&hellip;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;\nthat&rsquo;s a difficult problem. Have you tried&hellip;saying anything?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>His\neyes widen, slightly appalled. &ldquo;Oh, no! I couldn&rsquo;t possibly&hellip;&rdquo;\nhe tails off, at her expression. He hesitates, face burning. &ldquo;<i>Mutti</i>,\njust&hellip;say that there was something&hellip;&rdquo; he ignores her triumphant\nsmile, resolute. &ldquo;Say that there was something&hellip;that I wanted to\nsay to someone.&rdquo; His face burns hotter than fire. &ldquo;How would I\neven&hellip;&rdquo; he gestures wildly. \n</p>\n<p>Her\ngentle smile makes him pause, as she takes his hand in hers. &ldquo;Just\nsay it. I&rsquo;m sorry, but there&rsquo;s no other way.&rdquo; She sends a look\nover to where the other two stand, still talking in low voices. &ldquo;But\nyou know&hellip; I think you&rsquo;re lucky to have them, and they to have\nyou. You three&hellip;&rdquo; she shook her head, &ldquo;you three have a magic\nbetween you, that&rsquo;s not just the kind you learn in your classes.\nYou&rsquo;ve always been better together.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsmiles to himself, as she ran her thumb over the back of his hand. &ldquo;I\nknow, <i>Mutti</i>. And&hellip; thank you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She\nhugs him again, and he lets himself smile wider as her hair tickles\nhis face. &ldquo;Any time, <i>Kr</i><i>&uuml;</i><i>melchen</i>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Mutt</i><i>er</i>&hellip;\nplease <i>s</i>top\nit&hellip; I&rsquo;m not a baby anymore&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Her\nlaughter is as warm as he always remembered it, mingling with the\ncontented chatter and quiet music of the room. She touches his cheek,\nlooking into his eyes with a proud smile, that is also slightly\nmelancholic; she misses the days of his childhood when he was at home\nwith her, he realises then. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nworry&rdquo; she says, cupping his cheek. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>He\nthinks about what she&rsquo;s said with a slightly clearer head on the\njourney back, as the carriage jostles him back and forth. The three\nare bundled up in warm knitted clothes for the journey, and Caleb is\nbeginning to feel very warm. It&rsquo;s not the many layers though; it&rsquo;s\nbecause he is sitting squeezed in between the two of them in two\nseats. The other seats are occupied by a large basket of freshly\nbaked bread, almond crescent cookies and gingerbread stars and cakes\nfilled with sweet plum jam. Gifts from their parents, as well as new\nknitted clothes to keep them warm in the winter, and a new fur-lined\ncloak each &ndash; these they are actually wearing, as it&rsquo;s cold on the\njourney. There is also a wheel of cheese of the kind they remember\nfrom their childhoods in the village, a small cask containing ale,\nmade by Caleb&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s cousin, who is the village brewer.\nSeveral clumsy wooden toys whittled by the younger children, just\nlearning their craft. A beautifully embroidered quilt from Eodwulf&rsquo;s\ngrandmother. A wood flute like Astrid&rsquo;s uncle used to play on\nsummer nights under the moon. \n</p>\n<p>Simple\ngifts, but they are glad of them. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nand Eodwulf are leaning against both of his shoulders and dozing as\nthey journey back to their master&rsquo;s house. Astrid&rsquo;s hair tickles\nhis nose, and Eodwulf&rsquo;s wool-gloved hand has come to rest on the\nseat, just touching Caleb&rsquo;s knee.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s\nnot new, of course. Or at least, not the closeness of them. Caleb and\nAstrid and Eodwulf have long passed the point in their friendship at\nwhich falling asleep curled together on the soft chairs in their\nlittle common room is ordinary. It is a source of comfort. When their\nmaster punishes them, or on nights when the nightmares come for one\nor the other of them, they will sometimes wordlessly slip into each\nother&rsquo;s rooms, not even needing to speak as they curl up together.\nThey&rsquo;re all used to closeness, to the gentle rhythm of each other&rsquo;s\nsleep breathing, the warm weight of each other pressed close. Them\nagainst the world. They understand this. \n</p>\n<p>Always\nbefore though, Caleb has imagined that this is what having siblings\nis like, but now, suddenly, it feels unimaginably different from\nthat. But to say that his mother&rsquo;s half-teasing, half insistent\nenquiring, has set him to rethinking that is a vast understatement;\nit has set off a firestorm inside his head, full of dangerous\npossibilities. Making his face heat even to contemplate, but somehow\nimpossible to look away from. \n</p>\n<p>And\ndoesn&rsquo;t he of all people know the possibilities of fire, doesn&rsquo;t\nhe know the way it spreads if left to itself?</p>\n<p>Astrid&rsquo;s\nhead nods against his chest, over his heart, and Caleb feels fire run\nup and down his whole body.</p>\n<p>Resignedly,\nhe raises the fur-lined travel blanket up to tuck around Astrid more\nfully, then hesitates for a moment, then lays his own head down on\ntop of Eodwulf&rsquo;s, pointedly resisting the sudden and urge to drop a\nkiss right in the center of his hair, where it parts.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Verdammt!</i>&rdquo;\nCaleb mutters to himself, as he closes his eyes in resignation.</p>\n<hr /><p>It\nis Eodwulf he kisses first, in the dim light of the lamp one night\nwhen Astrid is at a lesson. It is some months after the conversation with his mother, and he knows the others feel it too, now; the signs are there, or maybe they were all along, if only he had been looking. <br /></p><p>It was only a matter of time.<br /></p><p>They are sitting together by the fire,\nand silence has fallen; the kind of companionable silence that exists\nwhen people know each other so well that they understand each other\nperfectly without the need for words. Behind them, the fire is a dim\nred glow, and Caleb can see it reflected and dancing in miniature, in\nEodwulf&rsquo;s dark eyes, turned to molten amber in the firelight that\ncatches there. He feels something hitch in his chest, as they each\nlean forward, warm breath mingling between them as their lips meet.</p>\n<p>They\nare there for some time, kissing in the quiet.</p>\n<p>In\nfact, it is more time than Caleb thinks. Usually, he is able to know\nwhat time it is with perfect accuracy. But time, it seems, is\ndifferent in this situation &ndash; a fact he files away for future\nreference - because Astrid is back from her lesson. \n</p>\n<p>She\nknows immediately. Caleb sees it in her eyes, the small tug of a\nsmile at the corner of her mouth. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\npulls away quicker than Caleb, his face endearingly alarmed. He\ndoesn&rsquo;t want to hurt her feelings. &ldquo;Astrid! We were just&hellip;&rdquo; he\ntails off vaguely, darting a glance at Caleb. \n</p>\n<p>He\ncan&rsquo;t help it; he immediately starts laughing, buoyed up by the\ntouch of Eodwulf&rsquo;s lips he can still feel against his. Astrid\nstarts laughing too, her face splitting into a mischievous grin.\n&ldquo;Well&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I knew it was going to happen at some point.&rdquo;\nShe takes Caleb&rsquo;s hand, then Eodwulf&rsquo;s, looking endearingly\nvulnerable for a moment. As though asking for permission. Caleb takes\nher hand, holds it fiercely, tightly close, and she smiles again,\ncarrying on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sorry you had to start without me.&rdquo;</p>\n<hr /><p>Time\npasses, as time does.</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Master Ikithon are in the dungeons again, down the spiral from\nthe conservatory and into what sometimes seems like another world, in\ncontrast to the bright garden from which they enter that place. It is\neasier, Caleb has found, to think of it so; to separate these trips\nfrom the rest of his life. Some part of him, then, can pretend that\nthe work they do here is not real, that it is not a real person who\nscreams under his touch. \n</p>\n<p>The\nman &ndash; the traitor &ndash; is naked and submerged in water up to his\nneck, a large copper vessel almost like a bathtub. The metal conducts\nheat well; this Caleb knows from his lessons in alchemy. Chains run\nfrom his ankles, wrists and throat to heavy iron brackets on the\nwalls. \n</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon nods at him, and Caleb lays a hand against the copper\nexterior of the bath. \n</p>\n<p>He\nhas long since mastered the technique of heating water with\nexcruciating slowness, but they have been down here for some time\nnow; clouds of steam are beginning to roll off the top of the water,\nrising into the air which is growing hot and humid, though they are\ndeep in the dungeons. Caleb&rsquo;s face is shiny and dripping with sweat\nfrom the heat, but his hands do not shake as he lays them against the\nmetal. \n</p>\n<p>His\nteacher is watching him, after all. \n</p>\n<p>The\nheat rises, and the man in the bathtub begins to scream. All the\nwhile, Master Ikithon stands behind him with his hands clasped neatly\nbehind his back, asking questions in a voice with no inflection. He\nis thorough; he teases out information, getting into every corner and\nleaving nothing that could be of significance. \n</p>\n<p><i>Who\nwas your leader? When and where did the group meet? Did any of the\nothers get away? What were the plans if it went wrong? Where was your\nhideout? Do any of the other conspirators have families in the city?</i>\nAnd on and on. Caleb is expected to remember this, to take careful\nmental notes. Sometimes, after all, it is him doing the questioning.</p>\n<p>They\nall resist, at first; Caleb has come to know this. They all put up a\nshow of sticking to their treasonous principles. But when they are in\npain, when their minds are cooking within their flesh, then the truth\nspills. It takes control and attention to catch it as it does,\nthrough a semi-conscious haze and screams of agony, but Caleb is\nlearning. \n</p>\n<p>All\nfor the good of the empire, Caleb thinks, feeling a rush of\nsatisfaction as Master Ikithon nods to him approvingly, as he turns\nthe heat in the water up a little more. He is becoming good at\ntelling when they have no more to give, when the end must come. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare not unmerciful, after all. They are not cruel, they only seek the\ntruth, and once it has gone these traitors are mere husks, empty and\nworthless. Yet they still must be punished. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nraises the temperature of the water to boiling, the hiss mingling\nwith the man&rsquo;s final, exhausted scream. \n</p>\n<hr /><p>The\nfollowing summer, Eodwulf almost breaks. \n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nnever finds out exactly what happened. He and Astrid spend a brief\ntime speculating, but neither quite have the words to speak about it.\n\n</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s\nwhat they know; they know that Eodwulf is growing strong in his\nmagic. They know that Master Ikithon is teaching him to pry open\nminds, to spin illusions to strike fear and then pick their heads\nlike locks and break inside, to better let them spill their secrets\nto him. For the sake of the Empire, of course. Some traitors have\nmuch more to yield if given this treatment. It depends on the person,\nas their teacher says. Everyone has their own way in which they\nbreak. \n</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s\ndangerous, Caleb knows; such things are not his main area of study,\nbut he knows that Eodwulf has had trouble in the past with not\nletting them into his own mind. From what he knows, for that sort of\nmagic one&rsquo;s own empathy needs to be both sharpened and blunted all\nat once. This is to allow the connection and the mastery over the\ntarget to be strong and pervasive enough to do what must be done,\nwhile protecting one&rsquo;s own mind from the strain, or from\nretaliatory attacks. It&rsquo;s a delicate balance, and a fine line to\nwalk. \n</p>\n<p>They\ndo not know exactly what Eodwulf learns in his private lessons with\ntheir teacher, in the dungeons under the conservatory; it feels\nsafer, somehow, not to know.</p>\n<p>One\ngolden summer day, Caleb and Astrid are sitting in the garden\nreading. Or rather, Caleb is reading, and Astrid has set down her\nbook, is lying down in the grass across Caleb&rsquo;s lap and idly\nlevitating his wide-brimmed straw hat in the air above his head. It&rsquo;s\nstill a good sunshade; she keeps it expertly in place, shading his\nface and eyes so that his paler skin does not burn in the noonday\nsun. It&rsquo;s a companionable silence between them.</p>\n<p>The\nsilence is broken by the slamming open of the door to the\nconservatory, and Caleb frowns, closing his book as Eodwulf appears\nat the door.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Astrid&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She\ndrops the spell, and the hat flops neatly back down over Caleb&rsquo;s\nhead. He pulls up the brim to exchange a look as she sits up, looking\nover to where Eodwulf is running across the garden back to the house.</p>\n<p>There\nis something in the way he is running; desperation, fear. \n</p>\n<p>They\ncan&rsquo;t see his face from this distance. But it looks almost as\nthough he&rsquo;s running away from something. \n</p>\n<hr /><p>There\nis punishment, for running away from one&rsquo;s duties. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nis sitting on the ground, crying soundless tears and biting down hard\nenough on her lip to draw blood. Her glasses are cracked and her eyes\nare blank and staring into nothingness as Eodwulf stands in front of\nher, a trembling hand extended. Master Ikithon&rsquo;s hand is on his\nshoulder, his face grave. Illusion magic swirls about him, as Eodwulf\nchannels the spell that is making Astrid see horrors dance before her\neyes. Caleb feels a rush of sympathy for them both. The last time\nEodwulf made a mistake, it was Caleb who had to be the subject of his\ncorrective practice. Afterwards, Eodwulf had come to him gushing\napologies, curling up in Caleb&rsquo;s lap and sobbing. All Caleb had\nbeen able to do was hold him, stroking his hair and telling him that\nreally, he had been all right.</p>\n<p>(He\nhadn&rsquo;t been all right, actually; he had seen a detailed illusory\nimage of a dragon devouring his family, ripping them limb from limb\nwhile he was held in place and unable to go to them, and it still\nweighed on his mind, though he knew it was not real.)</p>\n<p>Eventually,\nAstrid had joined them, letting a weasel-formed Hieronymus curl\nsinuously around Eodwulf&rsquo;s neck as he sobbed into Caleb&rsquo;s\nshoulder. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, it would be different, Caleb knows. The look in Eodwulf&rsquo;s\neyes is different; something has tipped like a scale inside him. \n</p>\n<p>Suddenly,\nEodwulf is lowering his hand, the magic dissipating like smoke as\nAstrid slumps sideways. Caleb doesn&rsquo;t even know if she&rsquo;s\nconscious, and he wants nothing more than to run to her side. But in\nthat moment, he dare not. His eyes are fixed on Eodwulf, who had\nstopped casting his spell, in defiance of Master Ikithon&rsquo;s orders. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;\nEodwulf whispers, almost a question. As though he cannot believe the\nchoice he just made. His eyes are filled with tortured defiance,\ndarting toward their master, then looking back at the ground as\nthough he cannot look anymore. &ldquo;No&rdquo; he says again, eyes filling\nwith tears as he falls to his knees. &ldquo;No, no no no&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Caleb\nis about to reach out to him &ndash; though the look in their master&rsquo;s\neyes is one of disappointment, and reaching out to Eodwulf suddenly,\nin this moment, feels dangerous, as though fear and weakness is a\ndisease that is contagious &ndash; but before he can, Eodwulf turns, with\none last look at Master Ikithon, and runs from the room. \n</p>\n<p>Their\nmaster does no follow him, merely sighs, deep and disappointed. He\nshakes his head in sorrow, looking over at Astrid &ndash; beginning to\nlever herself up off the floor, wiping her tear-stained face roughly\nwith her sleeve &ndash; and Caleb, shuffling over to be at least by her\nside. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Class\ndismissed,&rdquo; says their master, his voice heavy with regret, and\nsweeps from the room, leaving behind a sense that whatever had\nhappened here today is not over.  \n</p>\n<hr /><p>When\nCaleb and Astrid return to their little common room, Eodwulf is not\nthere. They knock on his bedroom door. He has barricaded it shut &ndash;\nwith a chair under the handle rather than magic - and only relents\nwhen they threaten to blast it open. At this he opens the door only a\ncrack, one dark eye appears in the gap and looking at the two of\nthem, reproachful. &ldquo;<i>Was?</i>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Astrid\nplaces her hands on her hips, standing square in the doorway. She\nanswers deliberately in Common, voice accustory.  &ldquo;Why did you\nstop?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nopens the door a little more, and Caleb can see the droop of his\nshoulders. &ldquo;Because&hellip;because I was hurting you!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Idiot</i><i>!</i>&rdquo;\nshe snaps. Anyone else might think that she is angry, but Caleb knows\nthe truth. It is always fear that makes Astrid sharp as glass. Fear\nfor Eodwulf though; it&rsquo;s always for one of the two of them, never\nfor herself. &ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t just&hellip;&rdquo; she gestures with a\nhand in the air, agitated. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just&hellip;<i>not</i> do it!\nYou can&rsquo;t refuse him!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nhangs his head, looking away from her sullenly, not defending\nhimself. \n</p>\n<p>This\nonly seems to make things worse. In her anger, she summons\nHieronymus with a click of her fingers. He appears around her throat\nin the form of a snake, hissing along with her words. &ldquo;If you&hellip;if\nyou can&rsquo;t do something so simple, to someone you&hellip;&rdquo; Astrid\nbreaks off, biting her lip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never have the strength it\ntakes. It&rsquo;s fucking <i>selfish</i> to stop because of me, when you\n<i>know</i> I&rsquo;m stronger than that!&rdquo; She&rsquo;s glaring at him.\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in this together.&rdquo; She takes a deep breath, looking\nat Caleb for support. He lays a slightly trembling hand on her arm.\n&ldquo;And we can get through it together, and at the end we&rsquo;ll all be\ndefending the Empire together. But&hellip;&rdquo; her fingers clench in the\nsleeve of her shirt, ruching the fabric. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t just stop\nnow. We&rsquo;ve come too far. We have to keep going! <i>Stay on this\npath and don&rsquo;t turn aside</i>&hellip;remember?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Easy\nfor you to say&rdquo; counters Eodwulf, voice cracking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip;\nI&rsquo;m not strong like you. And I&rsquo;m not smart like Caleb&hellip;&rdquo; he\nsighs, running fingers through his hair, stopping Caleb&rsquo;s protest\nwith a raised hand. &ldquo;I&hellip; sometimes&hellip;&rdquo; he meets Astrid&rsquo;s\nglare, desperate, eyes filled with panic suddenly. &ldquo;Sometimes, I\ndon&rsquo;t know if I can do this, <i>mein</i><i>e</i><i> S</i><i>onnenblume</i>&hellip;&rdquo;\nEodwulf looks to Caleb for help as Astrid winces, crossing her arms\nover her chest and turning away. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Nein!</i>\nStop it! You <i>don&rsquo;t</i> get to say you can&rsquo;t do it. Not now,\nnot ever!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, squeezing Astrid&rsquo;s arm in a wordless gesture of comfort,\nmeeting Eodwulf&rsquo;s eyes at the same time. He reaches out to take his\nhand, but Eodwulf twitches away, so Caleb drops his hand awkwardly at\nhis side. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right, though. If Master Ikithon sent you away\nfrom here&hellip;&rdquo; he lets the sentence hang in the air, as they all\nimagine it. It was always supposed to be the three of them, after\nall; they wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do, how to be, with just two. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nsighs. &ldquo;He&hellip;he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; But Caleb can hear the uncertainty\nin his voice. Eodwulf wrings his hands, looking between the two of\nthem. He seems to only half be looking at their faces. &ldquo;Not for\nthis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Caleb\nsighs, stepping up and putting an arm around Astrid, whose hands are\nballed in fists at her sides, her shoulders tense. &ldquo;Eodwulf - &rdquo;</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can say more, there&rsquo;s a knock at the door. They all\nstart; it is a vanishingly rare occurrence that their teacher should\ncome to visit them after hours, unless in the case of a momentous\nastronomical even that he would have them witness. Yet still, they\nall know the sound of his knock, even the sound of his footsteps in\nthe hall. \n</p>\n<p>This\ntime, Eodwulf flinches violently at the sound, begins scrubbing at\nhis teary eyes with a sleeve with desperate haste.</p>\n<p>Caleb\ngets up to open it. Their teacher is there, but he doesn&rsquo;t look\nangry. He almost never does &ndash; only disappointed. Now, though, he\nseems to have easily slipped back into the mild-mannered, slightly\nindulgent smile, though it is a little aggrieved looking. \n</p>\n<p>He\nregrets having to punish them; he always tells them so. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ah,\nCaleb. May I see Eodwulf, please?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Caleb\nblinks a little, nodding quickly, and already Eodwulf is there beside\nhim, and only Caleb is close enough to see the stiffness in his\nmuscles, fear and panic written in every line of his body. \n</p>\n<hr /><p>The\nnext day Caleb stands in resolute stillness beside Astrid, both\ndrawing as much comfort as they can afford to allow themselves from\nthe closeness between them. It is just the two of them, and the\nsilence hangs over the whole house, heavy and oppressive. Neither of\nthem can concentrate on any work. \n</p>\n<p>He\nknows, at least, what Astrid is thinking, as she lets Hieronymus\ntwine about her fingers, quickly enough to indicate that she is\nnervous. She could send him to spy, but she does not, and Caleb\ndoesn&rsquo;t ask her to. \n</p>\n<p>He\nunderstands, because he is thinking the same thing, as they watch the\ndoor to their little sitting room, cautious glances cast from beneath\ntheir lashes. They are waiting for it to open, yet it does not, all\nday.</p>\n<p><i>That\nwill never be me</i>, Caleb thinks. <i>I will become stronger, so\nthat I never have to displease Master Ikithon so. I will not break,\nnot for anything. I must be made of steel and stone.</i></p>\n<p>At\nnight, Caleb and Astrid cling together in Astrid&rsquo;s bed, without any\nwords. No words are necessary; only the comfort that they can give\neach other, just by being close. They curl up together, and Caleb\nfalls asleep with his face pressed into the hollow of Astrid&rsquo;s\nthroat, her chin resting on the crown of his head.</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nis back the next day, quieter than usual but otherwise the same.</p>\n<p>Or\nnot quite the same; they do not speak of it, but there is something\ndifferent about him. Caleb can&rsquo;t quite place it at first, until he\ncan; the look in Eodwulf&rsquo;s eyes is different, after whatever\npunishment Master Ikithon dealt out. Eodwulf looks far away, his eyes\nnot quite making contact as they used to. \n</p>\n<p>Astrid\nnotices it immediately too. The two of them do not speak about their\nargument the day before; somehow, such a discussion seems reduntant,\nnow. \n</p>\n<p>And\nEodwulf is different in other ways, after that. More withdrawn,\nslower to show his emotions and slower to cry, either with joy or\nsorrow. They&rsquo;ve all changed, over the years, but this is the time\nthat Caleb and Astrid see it most clearly. \n</p>\n<p>They\nare happy for him, they tell themselves. Eodwulf is stronger now, and\nhe will not make the same mistake again. This, they can see in his\neyes more than anything, eyes that tell a little less now. Eyes that\nare a little darker, a little blanker, but not so quick to betray\nhim. More driven and hungry, more steel behind the softness.</p>\n<p>Caleb&rsquo;s\nmind slips away from the shadows under those eyes, slightly deeper\nthan before. He&rsquo;s almost jealous. Eodwulf also seems to have mended\nfences with Master Ikithon; though of course, their teacher was\nalways the sort who would forgive them in the end. They are his\nshining stars, after all, the bright future of the Empire.</p>\n<p><i>Just\nas long as they stay on the path, and do not turn aside.</i></p>\n<hr /><p>Eodwulf\ncuts his hair short, that year. It has always been long, not as long\nas Astrid&rsquo;s golden braid &ndash; which she has taken to looping around\nher head and pinning into a neat little crown with pins that seem to\nturn up everywhere, even amongst Caleb&rsquo;s spell components and\nwriting materials &ndash; but long enough to hang in soft, inky ringlets\nto about his shoulders. With short hair, Eodwulf looks so different\nthat for a brief moment Caleb doesn&rsquo;t recognise him. But then there\nis Astrid&rsquo;s gasp, running over to Eodwulf and immediately carding\nher fingers through his short hair, and Caleb is smiling too, telling\nhim that it looks better now. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn&rsquo;t know if he actually thinks that; it makes Eodwulf look\nolder, and certainly more attractive. You can see his face fully now,\nwhereas before his eyes would often be half-covered by a fall of\nhair. And the part of Caleb that makes his heart flutter whenever he\nwatches Eodwulf&rsquo;s hands at work, that melts into his arms when\ntheir lips meet in a passionate kiss&hellip;that part of him is all for\nit. But there&rsquo;s another part, a part that loved the feeling of\nrunning his fingers through thick dark locks, a part that remembered\nhow much a younger Eodwulf had taken pride in his long hair, and\nwondered if the loss of the sweet and shy child who had been one of\nhis two best friends long before they had ever become lovers was\nworth the price. It&rsquo;s not just hair, after all; something else has\nchanged, something that goes bone-deep. \n</p>\n<p>He\ndoesn&rsquo;t say this though; instead he promises to lend Eodwulf the\nhair pomade that his father gave him, the very moment he learned that\nCaleb would be mixing with the nobles in the city. The smell reminds\nCaleb powerfully of his childhood; his father would comb the stuff\nthrough Caleb&rsquo;s hair to tame his wild ginger mop, for special\noccasions; births, marriages, funerals, festivals of all sorts. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\naccepts it with a smile and a nod, but his eyes betray nothing. \n</p>\n<hr /><p>They\nhave certain unspoken agreements, the three of them; truths that they\nnever quite decided outright, boundaries that they do not cross,\nwithout being quite able to say why. \n</p>\n<p>One\nof these is that they rarely speak to each other of what goes on in\ntheir private lessons with their master. For rhe ones that take place\nin the dungeons below the conservatory, this goes double. And those\nlessons are becoming more and more frequent; Master Ikithon must know\nthat they all have the strength to be able to do what must be done,\nthinks Caleb with a slight glow of pride.</p>\n<p>Today\nis one of the exceptions, and Astrid is the reason for it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And\nso, once I had asked that question, Master Ikithon seemed terribly\npleased that I&rsquo;d apparently hit the nail on the head of a whole\narea of scholarship&hellip;did you know that there are many philosophers\nof magic over the years who have done experiments on whether the\nundead can feel pain?&rdquo; Astrid is prestidigitating the blood and\nviscera off her over-tunic, as the others watch. One spell isn&rsquo;t\nenough to get it clean, so she&rsquo;s doing it repeatedly, telling Caleb\nand Eodwulf about her most recent lesson as she works. &ldquo;And he\nseemed excited that my questions had gone to that place - &rdquo; she\nsmiles proudly &ldquo; - and loaned me several books&hellip;&rdquo; she waves a\nbloody hand over at the large stack of books on the floor beside her.\n\n</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf exchange a look of recognition, and pride; they\nunderstand why Astrid is so animated, after all. They all live for\nthe feeling of their teacher telling them that their thinking on a\nparticular topic is sound. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And\nI take it it became a practical lesson?&rdquo; Caleb asks, raising an\neyebrow. When one of them begins a philosophical discussion, their\nmaster is always the first to encourage them to test their findings,\nand learn more.</p>\n<p>Astrid\nfreezes, then nods slowly. &ldquo;It did.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nand Caleb exchange another look. &ldquo;&hellip;And?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Astrid\nswallows, pressing her lips together for a moment, before looking up\nat them. &ldquo;All experiments show that the undead do feel pain. The\nmanner and degree seems to depend very much on how recently death\noccurred, type of undead, the level of the spell used to resurrect\nthem, the strength and character of the mage who casts it. But&hellip;yes&rdquo;\nshe says. She hesitates a little longer. &ldquo;Also, there&rsquo;s the\nproblem that if they die, the information we want dies with them&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Caleb\nand Eodwulf nod. They&rsquo;ve experienced this before; their master is\nalways most displeased when they kill a traitor too early, before all\nthe information they contain has been wrung from them. It&rsquo;s a\ndelicate process. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;But\ntheoretically at least, one could bring them back an unlimited number\nof times. Now, getting information out is not a trivial problem\neither, as resurrection does not always leave the mind and memories\nintact&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;\nsays Caleb, nodding. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But\nit&rsquo;s something that Master Ikithon said is an area ripe for future\nexperimentation. Maybe if we collect enough data, I will even be\nallowed to make a presentation of my findings before the next sitting\nof the Cerberus Assembly!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Astrid,\nthat is wonderful.&rdquo; Eodwulf raises an eyebrow, eyes fixed on her\nface. \n</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,\ncongratulations!&rdquo; Caleb grins, then falters, when he sees Eodwulf\nlooking at Astrid strangely.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are&hellip;are\nyou all right?&rdquo; he asks; it is true, she is not looking quite as\nhappy about about the prospect as perhaps she should be. \n</p>\n<p>He\nwonders what is going through her mind, but restrains himself from\ncasting a simple Detect Thoughts to try to find out. He thinks he can\nguess some of it, anyway.</p>\n<p>She\nlooks up at him, and Caleb sees something run between the two of\nthem, some calculation that he is not quite a party too, but thinks\nhe understands at least partially too. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Astrid says, going\nback to her bloody tunic, with a determined smile. &ldquo;Yes, I am\nfine.&rdquo;</p>\n<hr /><p>Master\nIkithon brings them to Rexxentrum with him, sometimes. Truly to the\ncity in a beautiful coach with horses, rather than just through the\nportal to the dungeons. \n</p>\n<p>(That\nis, after all, a different world.) \n</p>\n<p>He\nwants to show them off, this best and brightest, and the knowledge\nmakes Caleb&rsquo;s heart flutter with troublesome nerves. Caleb squashes\nthem resolutely; this is too important to allow his fear to get in\nthe way.</p>\n<p>Getting\ndressed for the occasion helps. They wear stiff formal uniforms for\nofficial visits, imperial black and gold with red trim, buttoned up\nto the neck and tied with heavy and complex sashes and pinned with a\nbeautiful golden brooch that is probably worth more than several\nyears&rsquo; worth of his parents&rsquo; wages on its own, he thinks. Things\nlike this occur to him sometimes; it&rsquo;s always a strangely\ndisorientating moment, when they do. \n</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s\nall right, though; when he&rsquo;s a real mage working for the Empire,\nwith a position of his own, then he&rsquo;ll be able to send them all the\nmoney they could ever want. \n</p>\n<p>He\nlikes that thought.</p>\n<hr /><p>They\ndance, sometimes. Caleb is not good at it &ndash; easily the worst of the\nthree &ndash; but he is getting better. Astrid is a good dancer; she has\nloved it since she was a child, twirling in a yellow dress at Harvest\nClose in Blumenthal. But now she has learned refinement, quickly\npicking up the steps to dances that the nobles of Rexxentrum favour. \n</p>\n<p>Eodwulf\nwas always timid, before, but he is learning to dance too. Since the\ntime he almost broke, he has been less afraid, less conflicted. More\npoised, appearing older even though he is the youngest of the three. \n</p>\n<p>Now,\nEodwulf and Caleb sit on the side of the hall, sipping a fizzy, astringent green drink from crystal flutes. They watch Astrid polka\nacross the floor with a beautiful orange tiefling arcanist dressed\nall in flowing white silks. \n</p>\n<p>The\ntwo dance together after a little while, spinning slowly across the\nfloor. Then Caleb dances with Astrid, a little pink-cheeked from the\ndrink and from dancing every dance. She bows to him with an\nexaggerated flourish before going over to Eodwulf and taking his hand\nin hers. \n</p>\n<p>All\nthis makes Caleb feel almost strong enough to socialise a little, as\nthey are supposed to. He knows that the author of a treatise on\nmagical metallurgy and mining techniques that he found so fascinating\nlast year is here, and Caleb has been working up courage to go and\nspeak to him all evening. \n</p>\n<p>But\nbefore he can do so, Master Ikithon catches his arm. He looks up,\nsurprised; his master has been deep in conversation with Oremid Hass,\nas well as several other dignitaries whose names Caleb doesn&rsquo;t\nknow, their faces graver than usual. Something is preparing, maybe.\nAnd so, he is grateful and proud that his master has a moment to\nspare for him.</p>\n<p>Master\nIkithon comes close, conspiratorial. &ldquo;Ah, Caleb. Enjoying the\nevening?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,\nvery much.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He\ngives Caleb a long, calculating look, then nods, patting him on the\nshoulder approvingly, steering him towards the group of dignitaries\nin the corner. &ldquo;Good. Now, go and do what you&rsquo;re here for&hellip;you\nwon&rsquo;t be a student forever, and the world must know your face. Do\nnot disappoint me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of\ncourse not!&rdquo; \n</p>\n<p>And\nin that moment, he resolves to keep that promise as much as he can,\nwith everything he has to give.</p>\n<hr /><p>Their\nmaster has been away a lot recently; there is trouble in the capital,\nrumours of traitors high up within the Cerberus Assembly. Rogue\nmages, making off with important state secrets. Caleb and the others\ndon&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true, but their master seems troubled. Not\nthat they have much time to wonder, as their workload is increasing.</p>\n<p>Even\nwhile he is away on business to Rexxentrum though, Master Ikithon\nwill meet them in the dungeons under the city; he has taught them to\nopen the portal under the conservatory themselves, a great honour and\na great weight of responsibility. They are undertaking more and more\nof the interrogations on their own, too. \n</p>\n<p>It\nbecomes almost routine, even a welcome respite from the rest of their\nwork.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon; they are all nervous, and tensions run high.\nAstrid and Eodwulf fight over nothing, and do not speak for a week,\nand Caleb is miserable and frustrated the whole time acting as their\nintermediary. They make up in tears, a little later, and it is a\nrelief, but the pressure remains. Astrid takes to constantly\nreorganising her collection of poisons, the little bottles\nmeticulously labeled and cataloged. Eodwulf paces their sitting\nroom in front of the fire, eyes half closed, lips moving slightly as\nhe runs through spells in his mind. Caleb finds himself writing\neverything down, even more so than before; it helps him to organise\nhis thoughts, but his room is awash with paper, stacks and piles of\nit, going through pots of ink and pens at an alarming rate.</p>\n<p>They\nare to graduate soon, their master says; sooner than they expected,\nbut their master needs them to reach their full potential sooner\nrather than later. He needs to have them trained soon, so that they\ncan aid him at his side, fully within his trust. \n</p>\n<p>No\nlonger students, but full members of the highest circle of mages in\nthe Empire. \n</p>\n<p>The\nprospect is both unnerving and exhilarating. Caleb thinks about how\nproud his parents will be, and it only makes him push himself harder.</p>\n<p>And\nso they study, and study more, and practice and prepare themselves.\nThere will be a final test of their abilities, they all know. Their\nmaster has not told them what it is yet, but they throw all of their\nstrength and academic abilities into preparing, into becoming\nstronger and cleverer. Caleb goes to bed each night exhausted, his\nmind thrumming with spells and lists and facts and incantations, and\nsometimes the screams of the traitors in the dungeons. Sometimes\nEodwulf or Astrid are with him, pressed close in the dark, or falling\nasleep over their work in front of the fireplace.</p>\n<p>And\nthen, one day, their master comes to them with an announcement. They\nlook at each other with trepidation in their eyes; could this be it?</p>\n<p>But\nno; Master Ikithon surprises them with the gift of some time off. He\ntells them he is giving them two weeks to return to Blumenthal and\ntheir families, once more before they graduate and assume positions\nin Rexxentrum. \n</p>\n<p>He\ntells them to enjoy the time, as afterwards their lives will change\nentirely. \n</p>\n<p>(Caleb\ndoesn&rsquo;t understand until later how true that statement is.)</p>\n<p>Before\nthey go, he wishes them each farewell with his strange blessing, one\nlast time. Master Ikithon&rsquo;s fingers feel warm against Caleb&rsquo;s\ntemple under the lightest of touches. The words sound familiar, an\necho of the years they have spent, of all the work and all of\nthemselves that they have given. A binding of their hearts to his\nmind, the three of them trusting their teacher implicitly. &ldquo;Stay\non this path and don&rsquo;t turn aside, and it will take you far.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They\nhold hands, all three in a row, as they begin their journey home.</p></p>",
