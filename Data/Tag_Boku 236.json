It felt almost childlike, to pass you a note but he was afraid he couldn\u2019t articulate it any other way.\u00a0His last mistake was sheepishly asking Mirio to proofread it - his goal from then on was to make his friend happy and introduce the two of you formally.\u00a0</p><p>\n\n\u2606 Mirio was, undeniably, a superb wingman but Tamaki grimaced with unease at each of his attempts to bring you two closer together. The more he got to know you though, he was relieved to find that your vibrant personality made it easier and easier to talk with you - it was hard for him to resist a small chuckle when you finally levelled with Mirio, letting him know that\u00a0\u201cif your friend wants to talk to me, surely he can do it himself\u201d.<br/></p><p>\u201cThen <i>my</i> job here is done!\u201d Mirio said with a smile and a wink.<br/></p><p>\n\n\u2606 Tamaki appreciates your ability to give sound advice and encouragement, even if his kneejerk reaction is to feel as though he is being patronized, or scolded.

It was a sort of security blanket at first, but in time he came to truly appreciate the long, quiet evenings with you watching your favorite shows, reading books, or having you read a favorite story to him. It allowed you to share a bond that had little need for words, which he treasured.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\n\n\u2606 His somewhat escapist tendencies would allow him to revel in your love of fantasy with you, from worlds filled with magic, to those more realistic tales of the triumph of good versus evil. With your artistic tendencies, he\u2019d find ways of helping you develop new stories, and plan art pieces - often times indulging himself by imagining the two of you in place of the main characters.
