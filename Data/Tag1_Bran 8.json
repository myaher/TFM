With every step on the stones you felt like a huge monster, stomping around. You felt like you weighed so much that surely every footfall sounded like a tree falling in the forest. You sped up your pace, trying to get back to your chambers as quickly as you could. Every step bringing tears and making you long for the privacy of your room even more.</p><p>Thankfully for you Bran was away in some meeting; he wouldn\u2019t be there when you felt so weak. You didn\u2019t want him to see you that way. On top of seeing you as revolting, you didn\u2019t need him seeing you as helpless.</p><p>You sat down on the edge of your bed with a sob. You had known that you weren\u2019t exactly the thinnest girl around, but it never bothered you. At least, it never bothered you to the point it did today. Bran loved you unconditionally, and that is what mattered to you. But hearing the ladies of the court speak about you that way behind your back was devastating.</p><p>You had feared not fitting in at court, but once you married Bran all of your worries seemed to vanish. The ladies accepted you, and the lords respected you. But now, all of that security went up in smoke. You were filled with paranoia, afraid now that everybody in court thought the same of you.</p><p><i>Of course they do</i>, you thought. <i>I\u2019m a fat pig.</i></p><p>The little voice in the back of your head wouldn\u2019t stop running wild, throwing insults at yourself and hurling words that would hurt you the worst. From your spot in the bed you were suddenly very aware of how your stomach felt. The way that it would roll over itself, leaving creases in the fabric of your dress.</p><p><i>They were right. I really am disgusting.</i></p><p>You stood up, very aware of the way your thighs jiggled when you did so. Your thighs rubbed together as you walked, making the tears fall faster. You shed your beautiful gown, feeling unfit to wear such a gorgeous garment. As you took it off, you turned to face yourself in the mirror hanging on the wall of your room.</p><p>You saw your double chin which only got worse as you looked down to the rest of your body. Your upper arms reminded you of wings as they jiggled and jostled, only rivaled by your midsection. Your stomach seemed too big for your body, as if perhaps you had eaten a whole feast on your own. You looked through blurry eyes at your reflection as your eyes continued to water and let tears cascade down your cheeks. Your thighs were no better, looking like two sacks of potatoes covered in cellulite.</p><p>You felt like the most horrid woman in the world.</p><p>The door opened, startling you from your thoughts. You wiped furiously at your face in an attempt to dry it, scrambling to pull a blanket around your body so you were less exposed to the unknown intruder.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Darling?\u201d Came a loving voice, that of your dear husband Bran. As he wheeled into the room and shut the door behind him, you saw his face drop.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He took one look at you, desperately trying to hide your body even though you now knew it was only him. He didn\u2019t need to use his greensight to know how you felt.</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N,\u201d he said sadly, reaching out to grab your hand.\u00a0\u201cLet go of the blanket.\u201d</p><p>The tears began falling from your eyes again as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m repulsive,\u201d you whispered. You let out a sob despite trying to hold it back,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not thin and beautiful like the other ladies here in King\u2019s Landing. I\u2019m not the right size.\u201d<br/></p><p>Bran let out a small sigh before he responded. He reached out for your other hand, and you let him take it this time. The blanket fell to a pool at your feet and Bran took the opportunity to let go of your hands and caress your body.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you\u2019re right.\u201d He said, startling you and making your chest tighten as you wanted to scream. Noticing your reaction, he quickly continued.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right that you aren\u2019t thin, I mean. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re repulsive.\u201d You looked down to meet Bran\u2019s big brown eyes, full of love and compassion.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you could think that you aren\u2019t the right size. You are the perfect size for me. I love you My Dear, you know that I do with all my heart.\u201d<br/></p><p>You bent down, allowing Bran to take you into his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Bran,\u201d you told him through your tears.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd trust me,\u201d continued Bran,\u00a0\u201cyou won\u2019t have to worry about people like that ever again.\u201d<br/></p><p>You gasped, pulling back to look at Bran. Had he looked into your past to see what had happened?</p><p>\u201cBran, you promised you would never invade my privacy like that!\u201d You yelled.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t do that at all Darling,\u201d he assured you.\u00a0\u201cSer Brienne heard what they were saying. I reckon she has been in a similar situation.\u201d<br/></p><p>You smiled sadly, knowing that he was right. You had become good friends with Brienne during your time in King\u2019s Landing. You bonded over many things, one being the way you were viewed.</p><p>\u201cThey will have to leave the Red Keep by morning.\u201d He revealed.<br/></p><p>You let Bran pull you back into his arms, savoring the feeling of him holding you. If you fit so well in his arms, perhaps he was right. You were the perfect size for him.</p><p><b>A/N: </b>I really liked this request! I hope I was able to do it justice for you. I have had body image issues myself for years, and although I may have changed the specific insecurities for this fic I poured my heart and soul into it. I really hope you enjoyed.</p><p>If you liked this, consider buying me a coffee &ndash;&gt; <a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/brrahbrrahcharacterimagines\">Ko-Fi</a></p>",

With every step on the stones you felt like a huge monster, stomping around. You felt like you weighed so much that surely every footfall sounded like a tree falling in the forest. You sped up your pace, trying to get back to your chambers as quickly as you could. Every step bringing tears and making you long for the privacy of your room even more.</p><p>Thankfully for you Bran was away in some meeting; he wouldn\u2019t be there when you felt so weak. You didn\u2019t want him to see you that way. On top of seeing you as revolting, you didn\u2019t need him seeing you as helpless.</p><p>You sat down on the edge of your bed with a sob. You had known that you weren\u2019t exactly the thinnest girl around, but it never bothered you. At least, it never bothered you to the point it did today. Bran loved you unconditionally, and that is what mattered to you. But hearing the ladies of the court speak about you that way behind your back was devastating.</p><p>You had feared not fitting in at court, but once you married Bran all of your worries seemed to vanish. The ladies accepted you, and the lords respected you. But now, all of that security went up in smoke. You were filled with paranoia, afraid now that everybody in court thought the same of you.</p><p><i>Of course they do</i>, you thought. <i>I\u2019m a fat pig.</i></p><p>The little voice in the back of your head wouldn\u2019t stop running wild, throwing insults at yourself and hurling words that would hurt you the worst. From your spot in the bed you were suddenly very aware of how your stomach felt. The way that it would roll over itself, leaving creases in the fabric of your dress.</p><p><i>They were right. I really am disgusting.</i></p><p>You stood up, very aware of the way your thighs jiggled when you did so. Your thighs rubbed together as you walked, making the tears fall faster. You shed your beautiful gown, feeling unfit to wear such a gorgeous garment. As you took it off, you turned to face yourself in the mirror hanging on the wall of your room.</p><p>You saw your double chin which only got worse as you looked down to the rest of your body. Your upper arms reminded you of wings as they jiggled and jostled, only rivaled by your midsection. Your stomach seemed too big for your body, as if perhaps you had eaten a whole feast on your own. You looked through blurry eyes at your reflection as your eyes continued to water and let tears cascade down your cheeks. Your thighs were no better, looking like two sacks of potatoes covered in cellulite.</p><p>You felt like the most horrid woman in the world.</p><p>The door opened, startling you from your thoughts. You wiped furiously at your face in an attempt to dry it, scrambling to pull a blanket around your body so you were less exposed to the unknown intruder.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Darling?\u201d Came a loving voice, that of your dear husband Bran. As he wheeled into the room and shut the door behind him, you saw his face drop.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He took one look at you, desperately trying to hide your body even though you now knew it was only him. He didn\u2019t need to use his greensight to know how you felt.</p><p>\u201cOh, Y/N,\u201d he said sadly, reaching out to grab your hand.\u00a0\u201cLet go of the blanket.\u201d</p><p>The tears began falling from your eyes again as you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m repulsive,\u201d you whispered. You let out a sob despite trying to hold it back,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not thin and beautiful like the other ladies here in King\u2019s Landing. I\u2019m not the right size.\u201d<br></p><p>Bran let out a small sigh before he responded. He reached out for your other hand, and you let him take it this time. The blanket fell to a pool at your feet and Bran took the opportunity to let go of your hands and caress your body.</p><p>\u201cY/N, you\u2019re right.\u201d He said, startling you and making your chest tighten as you wanted to scream. Noticing your reaction, he quickly continued.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right that you aren\u2019t thin, I mean. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re repulsive.\u201d You looked down to meet Bran\u2019s big brown eyes, full of love and compassion.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you could think that you aren\u2019t the right size. You are the perfect size for me. I love you My Dear, you know that I do with all my heart.\u201d<br></p><p>You bent down, allowing Bran to take you into his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Bran,\u201d you told him through your tears.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd trust me,\u201d continued Bran,\u00a0\u201cyou won\u2019t have to worry about people like that ever again.\u201d<br></p><p>You gasped, pulling back to look at Bran. Had he looked into your past to see what had happened?</p><p>\u201cBran, you promised you would never invade my privacy like that!\u201d You yelled.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t do that at all Darling,\u201d he assured you.\u00a0\u201cSer Brienne heard what they were saying. I reckon she has been in a similar situation.\u201d<br></p><p>You smiled sadly, knowing that he was right. You had become good friends with Brienne during your time in King\u2019s Landing. You bonded over many things, one being the way you were viewed.</p><p>\u201cThey will have to leave the Red Keep by morning.\u201d He revealed.<br></p><p>You let Bran pull you back into his arms, savoring the feeling of him holding you. If you fit so well in his arms, perhaps he was right. You were the perfect size for him.</p><p><b>A/N: </b>I really liked this request! I hope I was able to do it justice for you.
