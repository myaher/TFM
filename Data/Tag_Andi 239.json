        "body": "<h1>Tyrus: We Need To Stop Dragging Our Feet</h1><p>Synopsis: Cyrus finds out that TJ has more of a protective side than he&rsquo;d previously thought, and hand in hand finds out that it might cause some tension.</p><p>Word Count: 2344</p><p>Ao3: (<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16464776/chapters/38609087\">x</a>)</p><p>Cyrus is almost hesitant to go to the swings, for one reason, and one reason only: he is one hundred percent sure that TJ will already be there, and he\u2019s one hundred percent sure that his face is the last one TJ wants to see.</p><p>Cyrus is definitely not one for fights, especially with the people he cares about the most. He\u2019d burst out crying when he and Andi got into a fight in the fourth grade because she covered his favourite mechanical pencil in washi tape. Of course, now the pencil is safely kept in a box of fond memories, but it still felt like a big deal at the time. Even recently, when Andi and Buffy had been in their own quarrel, Cyrus felt as though he had to fix it, because it just seems to be the thing he\u2019s good at. When he couldn\u2019t fix that one, he once again started crying, but this time in the quietness of his own bedroom, and not in the middle of a classroom. Cyrus is starting to find out that thirteen year old cries tend to be saved for privacy, when nobody can judge him for it.</p><p>Now, he finds himself in a fight of his own, and this time, with TJ. It was a huge misunderstanding, and was definitely sparked by the fact that they\u2019d both been withholding certain emotions, never letting the other know. At some point, something snapped.</p><p>They\u2019d been hanging out like normal, walking around after TJ\u2019s shift at the gym, having an enjoyable conversation about the importance of binder clips over paper clips (they held significantly more paper) when a boy from Cyrus\u2019 dance class approached them.</p><p>\u201cCyrus! Hey!\u201d he had exclaimed, waving as he crossed the street. Cyrus turned around, mostly confused, and smiled at the boy he didn\u2019t even know the name of.</p><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re in dance class, right?\u201d he asked, needing reassurance that he was recalling the same face. The boy nodded and laughed.</p><p>\u201cGlad to know I\u2019m so memorable.\u201d He reached a hand up to push his shaggy brown hair out of his eyes, only to have it come falling back down again. Cyrus was beginning to get uncomfortable, especially with TJ standing next to him, probably not even knowing what to do. Wasn\u2019t it rude to interrupt someone who was having a conversation? He was beginning to get annoyed with the nameless boy.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, I really have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you maybe wanted to hang out sometime?\u201d the boy asked. Cyrus raised an eyebrow, not really feeling entirely okay with this situation. \u201cI mean, I know this is kinda weird, running up to you on the street and all. But I don\u2019t know, I just figured if I didn\u2019t say it now, I wouldn\u2019t ever ask.\u201d Okay. This was definitely getting weird.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus turned around, stunned the the words hadn\u2019t come from his own mouth, but from TJ\u2019s. His eyes were narrowed, and he was cocking his eyebrow, standing much more rigidly than he was a few minutes ago. That was when Cyrus knew the worst had happened.</p><p>TJ had gone into intimidating bully mode.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back Scary-Basketball-Guy,\u201d Cyrus whispered to himself, stepping back to try and talk TJ out of bully mode. \u201cTJ, he\u2019s in my dance class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard that part. I just want to know why he\u2019s being all creepy,\u201d TJ said, definitely aimed at the now dubbed \u201cDance Dude\u201d by Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cTJ, please,\u201d Cyrus said softly, forcing eye contact with the older boy. When green eyes met brown, Cyrus almost saw him falter. Until he closed his eyes and looked to the side, face hardening again.</p><p>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t mean to get in the middle of you guys, I didn\u2019t realise. I\u2019ll just go,\u201d Dance Dude said, holding his arms up in surrender. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you Monday then?\u201d he asked Cyrus, looking completely terrified. Cyrus nodded silently, and the boy who still didn\u2019t have a name ran off, pocketing his hands as he rounded a corner fairly quickly. Cyrus definitely noted his lack of apology.</p><p>Then he turned to TJ, who looked like he was practically about to crack like a statue with how hard his facial expression was. Cyrus could barely look at him as he sighed, looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate it when you turn into Scary-Basketball-Guy,\u201d Cyrus deadpanned, not really sure how he was feeling. All he knew was that there was a pit in his stomach, and a pressure in his chest, threatening to escape in a scream.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate random people coming up to you and interrupting a conversation,\u201d TJ said, as if he was mad at Cyrus. His words sounded protective, but his tone sounded full of conviction. It knocked Cyrus back a step.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your protection all the time. I knew who he was!\u201d Cyrus said, his ears starting to burn with the heat of his now bubbling anger. Oh, no. It was starting.</p><p>\u201cOh please, you don\u2019t even know what his name is,\u201d TJ said, rolling his eyes. Cyrus\u2019 cheeks flared red in shame and humiliation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d Cyrus said quietly, crossing his arms over his chest, feeling so much smaller than he did before. \u201cHe was only being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d TJ said, his voice full of disgust. There was a muted thump, and Cyrus assumed it was TJ hitting his hand against his leg in exasperation. \u201cYou call that friendly? Listen to me Cyrus, he was flirting with you.\u201d The words came out clipped, dripping with venom, and Cyrus could only begin to wonder why before his mouth took over.</p><p>\u201cSo what if he was? What\u2019s so bad about a guy liking me?\u201d Cyrus said, his words coming out choked. If TJ was homophobic, he\u2019d never be able to recover from that discovery. He felt the back of his head starting to buzz, his fingers starting to tingle, and his eyes starting to sting. This was the beginning of a panic attack.</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d TJ started, but was cut off by his own sigh. He took a few deep breaths before his voice came back, this time quieter, almost unheard. \u201cNothing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is the problem here?\u201d Cyrus asked, a tear threatening to slip as he looked at TJ, who was staring at the ground, head ducked in what looked like humiliation. Suddenly, there was a small, wet spot on the pavement, and TJ was wiping his eyes, turning around. \u201cTJ, what is going on?\u201d he asked again, this time with more curiosity than conviction. TJ turned around suddenly.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Cyrus, I like you! Okay?\u201d TJ said, his lungs seeming to take an exhausted breath for him. Maybe it was a sob. Cyrus didn\u2019t know. He was, once again, knocked back a step. But this time, the pressure seemed to manifest in his heart, tearing it open and making him lose any sort of control. Tears began to fall down his cheeks, even if he didn\u2019t want them to. And he couldn\u2019t even move his arms to wipe them again. \u201cI like you.\u201d The words were more broken that time. Before Cyrus could even think about replying, TJ was already walking away quickly, his hands reaching up to his face.</p><p>Cyrus was simply left on the sidewalk, trying to pinpoint the moment things went bad.</p><p>Now, he\u2019s standing at the perimeter of the park, trying to decide whether he should take the step, or double back to where he was, and let them both just forget.</p><p>He can\u2019t forget, though. Not after a confession like that. Especially since the feelings aren\u2019t unrequited.</p><p>Looking around, the park seems deserted. Kids don\u2019t usually come to the park when it starts getting cold, seeing as the sun sets earlier, and parents don\u2019t want to parade around a freezing park just so their kids can go down a slide a few times before they lose interest due to their dwindling attention span. It makes for a perfect place for the older kids to hang out during fall and winter.</p><p>He swallows the lump in his throat, closing his eyes and realising just how exhausted he is. Bawling his eyes out tends to have that effect on him, and the fact that they were hand in hand with a panic attack definitely doesn\u2019t help. He knows that his eyelashes are crusted with tears, and his cheeks are red and puffy, but if he doesn\u2019t do this now, he never will. There will never be a better time.</p><p>Bravely, he steps onto the park property, listening to the crunching of leaves under his shoes, and the whistling of wind in his ears. He\u2019s light headed and dizzy, but he has to do this.</p><p>The only time he hesitates is when he starts to near the swings, and he sees the small, far away figure of TJ sitting there, head dipped, and feet barely leaving the ground. He stops for a moment, just simply watching, feeling horrible about everything. Quickly, he takes a deep breath, and starts forward again. As he\u2019s walking, the noisy leaves catch TJ\u2019s attention, and his head snaps up, staring dumbly at Cyrus before looking down again. Cyrus takes this as the closest thing he\u2019ll get to an invitation, and gets closer, sitting down on the swing next to TJ as if he\u2019s a feral cat, neither boy daring to say a word.</p><p>Cyrus begins swinging, hoping that the sound of the metal chain will make him brave enough to say what he needs to say. He\u2019d even rehearsed it.</p><p>Instead, he starts humming, feeling much more content starting out that way. But words startle him, and he stops swinging.</p><p>\u201cLegs go up, legs go down.\u201d The words are quiet, and sung with the melody of Cyrus\u2019 humming. A smile slowly manifests itself on Cyrus\u2019 face. \u201cThat\u2019s how we make the swing go \u2018round.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus starts to feel absolutely ridiculous as TJ sings the words he\u2019d made up when he was little, his cheeks burning at the embarrassment of hearing it come from someone else\u2019s mouth. At this point, TJ is one of three people who know about the song. And he actually bothered to remember the juvenile lyrics.</p><p>\u201cDrag your feet, you\u2019ll go slow. The more you drag, the less you go.\u201d</p><p>A mutual silence comes over them as Cyrus starts to swing again.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an idiot, don\u2019t you?\u201d TJ asks quietly, words broken. Cyrus has to take a deep breath. Apparently, the conversation part of the argument is happening now.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. That would make me an idiot, too,\u201d Cyrus tells him, almost forgetting how to speak for a moment. There\u2019s another beat of silence before TJ speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lost my temper. I know you hate the Scary-Basketball-Guy,\u201d he says, still not looking at Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOnly in certain situations. Other times he comes in handy,\u201d Cyrus tells him, trying to offer some sort of comic relief. He\u2019s really not sure how people handle these situations. He\u2019s just kinda winging it.</p><p>\u201cI just get protective sometimes. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d The words are honest, and raw, and they start splitting Cyrus\u2019 heart in half, simply because of how sweet they are. He can\u2019t help the smile that grows on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know. I get it. Trust me, if I had any capability of being intimidating, there would have been multiple casualties on my behalf, all from defending you,\u201d Cyrus admits. He\u2019s not beating around the bush. He doesn\u2019t have the time nor the patience for dragging things out. At this statement, TJ laughs, though it sounds more like a scoff.</p><p>\u201cNah, you don\u2019t have a mean bone in your body,\u201d he says, his voice full of what sounds like longing. It\u2019s now or never.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he starts, waiting until the older boy finally lifts his head to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d he says, looking into his eyes. His face is softer now than it was before, and he looks just as exhausted as Cyrus feels.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me that I didn\u2019t totally ruin everything?\u201d TJ asks, looking away. There\u2019s more humour in his voice than curiosity, the question laced with sarcasm. Cyrus laughs softly, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we just need to stop dragging our feet,\u201d he says, biting his lip. When TJ doesn\u2019t look at him, he reaches over, placing his hand on top of TJ\u2019s on the swing chain, pulling it off and tangling their fingers together, leaving them hanging between them.</p><p>\u201cThis is terrifying,\u201d TJ tells him, his free hand coming up to rub his forehead. Cyrus feels tension in the exact same place, suggesting that TJ must have had quite a similar crying session. The thought sends ice through his blood, and his look softens. He squeezes TJ\u2019s hand in reassurance, nodding when he looks at him.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. But if we do it together, it\u2019s much less scary,\u201d Cyrus reminds him. TJ takes a deep breath through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, Underdog,\u201d he says, forming his first real smile since before the argument.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replies, returning the gesture. Suddenly, everything\u2019s changed, and Cyrus isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s necessarily ready. Nevertheless, he\u2019s here now, and he can\u2019t go back.</p><p>\u201cWanna go to The Spoon? Maybe start this day over?\u201d TJ asks, proving to remain braver than Cyrus by a longshot. Cyrus nods, slowly letting go of TJ\u2019s hand and standing up, reaching out again, letting TJ return the gesture. Hand in hand, Cyrus starts to feel content as he faces TJ for the first time in this new, weird era.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s start over,\u201d he says, starting to walk backwards, pulling TJ along with him as wide smiles begin to take over their frowns, and sheepish conversation fills their silence, full of admiration and newfound mutual feelings. It\u2019s as if nothing had even happened, and yet everything still changed.</p>",

Cyrus takes this as the closest thing he\u2019ll get to an invitation, and gets closer, sitting down on the swing next to TJ as if he\u2019s a feral cat, neither boy daring to say a word.</p><p>Cyrus begins swinging, hoping that the sound of the metal chain will make him brave enough to say what he needs to say. He\u2019d even rehearsed it.</p><p>Instead, he starts humming, feeling much more content starting out that way. But words startle him, and he stops swinging.</p><p>\u201cLegs go up, legs go down.\u201d The words are quiet, and sung with the melody of Cyrus\u2019 humming. A smile slowly manifests itself on Cyrus\u2019 face. \u201cThat\u2019s how we make the swing go \u2018round.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus starts to feel absolutely ridiculous as TJ sings the words he\u2019d made up when he was little, his cheeks burning at the embarrassment of hearing it come from someone else\u2019s mouth. At this point, TJ is one of three people who know about the song. And he actually bothered to remember the juvenile lyrics.</p><p>\u201cDrag your feet, you\u2019ll go slow. The more you drag, the less you go.\u201d</p><p>A mutual silence comes over them as Cyrus starts to swing again.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an idiot, don\u2019t you?\u201d TJ asks quietly, words broken. Cyrus has to take a deep breath. Apparently, the conversation part of the argument is happening now.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. That would make me an idiot, too,\u201d Cyrus tells him, almost forgetting how to speak for a moment. There\u2019s another beat of silence before TJ speaks again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lost my temper. I know you hate the Scary-Basketball-Guy,\u201d he says, still not looking at Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOnly in certain situations. Other times he comes in handy,\u201d Cyrus tells him, trying to offer some sort of comic relief. He\u2019s really not sure how people handle these situations. He\u2019s just kinda winging it.</p><p>\u201cI just get protective sometimes. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d The words are honest, and raw, and they start splitting Cyrus\u2019 heart in half, simply because of how sweet they are. He can\u2019t help the smile that grows on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know. I get it. Trust me, if I had any capability of being intimidating, there would have been multiple casualties on my behalf, all from defending you,\u201d Cyrus admits. He\u2019s not beating around the bush. He doesn\u2019t have the time nor the patience for dragging things out. At this statement, TJ laughs, though it sounds more like a scoff.</p><p>\u201cNah, you don\u2019t have a mean bone in your body,\u201d he says, his voice full of what sounds like longing. It\u2019s now or never.</p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d he starts, waiting until the older boy finally lifts his head to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d he says, looking into his eyes. His face is softer now than it was before, and he looks just as exhausted as Cyrus feels.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me that I didn\u2019t totally ruin everything?\u201d TJ asks, looking away. There\u2019s more humour in his voice than curiosity, the question laced with sarcasm. Cyrus laughs softly, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we just need to stop dragging our feet,\u201d he says, biting his lip. When TJ doesn\u2019t look at him, he reaches over, placing his hand on top of TJ\u2019s on the swing chain, pulling it off and tangling their fingers together, leaving them hanging between them.</p><p>\u201cThis is terrifying,\u201d TJ tells him, his free hand coming up to rub his forehead. Cyrus feels tension in the exact same place, suggesting that TJ must have had quite a similar crying session. The thought sends ice through his blood, and his look softens. He squeezes TJ\u2019s hand in reassurance, nodding when he looks at him.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. But if we do it together, it\u2019s much less scary,\u201d Cyrus reminds him. TJ takes a deep breath through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, Underdog,\u201d he says, forming his first real smile since before the argument.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, too, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replies, returning the gesture. Suddenly, everything\u2019s changed, and Cyrus isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s necessarily ready. Nevertheless, he\u2019s here now, and he can\u2019t go back.</p><p>\u201cWanna go to The Spoon? Maybe start this day over?\u201d TJ asks, proving to remain braver than Cyrus by a longshot. Cyrus nods, slowly letting go of TJ\u2019s hand and standing up, reaching out again, letting TJ return the gesture. Hand in hand, Cyrus starts to feel content as he faces TJ for the first time in this new, weird era.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s start over,\u201d he says, starting to walk backwards, pulling TJ along with him as wide smiles begin to take over their frowns, and sheepish conversation fills their silence, full of admiration and newfound mutual feelings. It\u2019s as if nothing had even happened, and yet everything still changed.</p></p>",

He\u2019d burst out crying when he and Andi got into a fight in the fourth grade because she covered his favourite mechanical pencil in washi tape. Of course, now the pencil is safely kept in a box of fond memories, but it still felt like a big deal at the time. Even recently, when Andi and Buffy had been in their own quarrel, Cyrus felt as though he had to fix it, because it just seems to be the thing he\u2019s good at. When he couldn\u2019t fix that one, he once again started crying, but this time in the quietness of his own bedroom, and not in the middle of a classroom. Cyrus is starting to find out that thirteen year old cries tend to be saved for privacy, when nobody can judge him for it.</p><p>Now, he finds himself in a fight of his own, and this time, with TJ. It was a huge misunderstanding, and was definitely sparked by the fact that they\u2019d both been withholding certain emotions, never letting the other know. At some point, something snapped.</p><p>They\u2019d been hanging out like normal, walking around after TJ\u2019s shift at the gym, having an enjoyable conversation about the importance of binder clips over paper clips (they held significantly more paper) when a boy from Cyrus\u2019 dance class approached them.</p><p>\u201cCyrus! Hey!\u201d he had exclaimed, waving as he crossed the street. Cyrus turned around, mostly confused, and smiled at the boy he didn\u2019t even know the name of.</p><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re in dance class, right?\u201d he asked, needing reassurance that he was recalling the same face. The boy nodded and laughed.</p><p>\u201cGlad to know I\u2019m so memorable.\u201d He reached a hand up to push his shaggy brown hair out of his eyes, only to have it come falling back down again. Cyrus was beginning to get uncomfortable, especially with TJ standing next to him, probably not even knowing what to do. Wasn\u2019t it rude to interrupt someone who was having a conversation? He was beginning to get annoyed with the nameless boy.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, I really have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you maybe wanted to hang out sometime?\u201d the boy asked. Cyrus raised an eyebrow, not really feeling entirely okay with this situation. \u201cI mean, I know this is kinda weird, running up to you on the street and all. But I don\u2019t know, I just figured if I didn\u2019t say it now, I wouldn\u2019t ever ask.\u201d Okay. This was definitely getting weird.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus turned around, stunned the the words hadn\u2019t come from his own mouth, but from TJ\u2019s. His eyes were narrowed, and he was cocking his eyebrow, standing much more rigidly than he was a few minutes ago. That was when Cyrus knew the worst had happened.</p><p>TJ had gone into intimidating bully mode.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back Scary-Basketball-Guy,\u201d Cyrus whispered to himself, stepping back to try and talk TJ out of bully mode. \u201cTJ, he\u2019s in my dance class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard that part. I just want to know why he\u2019s being all creepy,\u201d TJ said, definitely aimed at the now dubbed \u201cDance Dude\u201d by Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cTJ, please,\u201d Cyrus said softly, forcing eye contact with the older boy. When green eyes met brown, Cyrus almost saw him falter. Until he closed his eyes and looked to the side, face hardening again.</p><p>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t mean to get in the middle of you guys, I didn\u2019t realise. I\u2019ll just go,\u201d Dance Dude said, holding his arms up in surrender. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you Monday then?\u201d he asked Cyrus, looking completely terrified. Cyrus nodded silently, and the boy who still didn\u2019t have a name ran off, pocketing his hands as he rounded a corner fairly quickly. Cyrus definitely noted his lack of apology.</p><p>Then he turned to TJ, who looked like he was practically about to crack like a statue with how hard his facial expression was. Cyrus could barely look at him as he sighed, looking at the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate it when you turn into Scary-Basketball-Guy,\u201d Cyrus deadpanned, not really sure how he was feeling. All he knew was that there was a pit in his stomach, and a pressure in his chest, threatening to escape in a scream.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate random people coming up to you and interrupting a conversation,\u201d TJ said, as if he was mad at Cyrus. His words sounded protective, but his tone sounded full of conviction. It knocked Cyrus back a step.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your protection all the time. I knew who he was!\u201d Cyrus said, his ears starting to burn with the heat of his now bubbling anger. Oh, no. It was starting.</p><p>\u201cOh please, you don\u2019t even know what his name is,\u201d TJ said, rolling his eyes. Cyrus\u2019 cheeks flared red in shame and humiliation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d Cyrus said quietly, crossing his arms over his chest, feeling so much smaller than he did before. \u201cHe was only being friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d TJ said, his voice full of disgust. There was a muted thump, and Cyrus assumed it was TJ hitting his hand against his leg in exasperation. \u201cYou call that friendly? Listen to me Cyrus, he was flirting with you.\u201d The words came out clipped, dripping with venom, and Cyrus could only begin to wonder why before his mouth took over.</p><p>\u201cSo what if he was? What\u2019s so bad about a guy liking me?\u201d Cyrus said, his words coming out choked. If TJ was homophobic, he\u2019d never be able to recover from that discovery. He felt the back of his head starting to buzz, his fingers starting to tingle, and his eyes starting to sting. This was the beginning of a panic attack.</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d TJ started, but was cut off by his own sigh. He took a few deep breaths before his voice came back, this time quieter, almost unheard. \u201cNothing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is the problem here?\u201d Cyrus asked, a tear threatening to slip as he looked at TJ, who was staring at the ground, head ducked in what looked like humiliation. Suddenly, there was a small, wet spot on the pavement, and TJ was wiping his eyes, turning around. \u201cTJ, what is going on?\u201d he asked again, this time with more curiosity than conviction. TJ turned around suddenly.</p><p>\u201cDamnit, Cyrus, I like you! Okay?\u201d TJ said, his lungs seeming to take an exhausted breath for him. Maybe it was a sob. Cyrus didn\u2019t know. He was, once again, knocked back a step. But this time, the pressure seemed to manifest in his heart, tearing it open and making him lose any sort of control. Tears began to fall down his cheeks, even if he didn\u2019t want them to. And he couldn\u2019t even move his arms to wipe them again. \u201cI like you.\u201d The words were more broken that time. Before Cyrus could even think about replying, TJ was already walking away quickly, his hands reaching up to his face.</p><p>Cyrus was simply left on the sidewalk, trying to pinpoint the moment things went bad.</p><p>Now, he\u2019s standing at the perimeter of the park, trying to decide whether he should take the step, or double back to where he was, and let them both just forget.</p><p>He can\u2019t forget, though. Not after a confession like that. Especially since the feelings aren\u2019t unrequited.</p><p>Looking around, the park seems deserted. Kids don\u2019t usually come to the park when it starts getting cold, seeing as the sun sets earlier, and parents don\u2019t want to parade around a freezing park just so their kids can go down a slide a few times before they lose interest due to their dwindling attention span. It makes for a perfect place for the older kids to hang out during fall and winter.</p><p>He swallows the lump in his throat, closing his eyes and realising just how exhausted he is. Bawling his eyes out tends to have that effect on him, and the fact that they were hand in hand with a panic attack definitely doesn\u2019t help. He knows that his eyelashes are crusted with tears, and his cheeks are red and puffy, but if he doesn\u2019t do this now, he never will. There will never be a better time.</p><p>Bravely, he steps onto the park property, listening to the crunching of leaves under his shoes, and the whistling of wind in his ears. He\u2019s light headed and dizzy, but he has to do this.</p><p>The only time he hesitates is when he starts to near the swings, and he sees the small, far away figure of TJ sitting there, head dipped, and feet barely leaving the ground. He stops for a moment, just simply watching, feeling horrible about everything. Quickly, he takes a deep breath, and starts forward again. As he\u2019s walking, the noisy leaves catch TJ\u2019s attention, and his head snaps up, staring dumbly at Cyrus before looking down again. Cyrus takes this as the closest thing he\u2019ll get to an invitation, and gets closer, sitting down on the swing next to TJ as if he\u2019s a feral cat, neither boy daring to say a word.</p><p>Cyrus begins swinging, hoping that the sound of the metal chain will make him brave enough to say what he needs to say. He\u2019d even rehearsed it.</p><p>Instead, he starts humming, feeling much more content starting out that way. But words startle him, and he stops swinging.</p><p>\u201cLegs go up, legs go down.\u201d The words are quiet, and sung with the melody of Cyrus\u2019 humming. A smile slowly manifests itself on Cyrus\u2019 face. \u201cThat\u2019s how we make the swing go \u2018round.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus starts to feel absolutely ridiculous as TJ sings the words he\u2019d made up when he was little, his cheeks burning at the embarrassment of hearing it come from someone else\u2019s mouth. At this point, TJ is one of three people who know about the song. And he actually bothered to remember the juvenile lyrics.</p><p>\u201cDrag your feet, you\u2019ll go slow. The more you drag, the less you go.\u201d</p><p>A mutual silence comes over them as Cyrus starts to swing again.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an idiot, don\u2019t you?\u201d TJ asks quietly, words broken.

This was definitely getting weird.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus turned around, stunned the the words hadn&rsquo;t come from his own mouth, but from TJ&rsquo;s. His eyes were narrowed, and he was cocking his eyebrow, standing much more rigidly than he was a few minutes ago. That was when Cyrus knew the worst had happened.</p><p>TJ had gone into intimidating bully mode.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome back Scary-Basketball-Guy,&rdquo; Cyrus whispered to himself, stepping back to try and talk TJ out of bully mode. &ldquo;TJ, he&rsquo;s in my dance class.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I heard that part. I just want to know why he&rsquo;s being all creepy,&rdquo; TJ said, definitely aimed at the now dubbed &ldquo;Dance Dude&rdquo; by Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, please,&rdquo; Cyrus said softly, forcing eye contact with the older boy. When green eyes met brown, Cyrus almost saw him falter. Until he closed his eyes and looked to the side, face hardening again.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I didn&rsquo;t mean to get in the middle of you guys, I didn&rsquo;t realise. I&rsquo;ll just go,&rdquo; Dance Dude said, holding his arms up in surrender. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll see you Monday then?&rdquo; he asked Cyrus, looking completely terrified. Cyrus nodded silently, and the boy who still didn&rsquo;t have a name ran off, pocketing his hands as he rounded a corner fairly quickly. Cyrus definitely noted his lack of apology.</p><p>Then he turned to TJ, who looked like he was practically about to crack like a statue with how hard his facial expression was. Cyrus could barely look at him as he sighed, looking at the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I hate it when you turn into Scary-Basketball-Guy,&rdquo; Cyrus deadpanned, not really sure how he was feeling. All he knew was that there was a pit in his stomach, and a pressure in his chest, threatening to escape in a scream.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t appreciate random people coming up to you and interrupting a conversation,&rdquo; TJ said, as if he was mad at Cyrus. His words sounded protective, but his tone sounded full of conviction. It knocked Cyrus back a step.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your protection all the time. I knew who he was!&rdquo; Cyrus said, his ears starting to burn with the heat of his now bubbling anger. Oh, no. It was starting.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please, you don&rsquo;t even know what his name is,&rdquo; TJ said, rolling his eyes. Cyrus&rsquo; cheeks flared red in shame and humiliation.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; Cyrus said quietly, crossing his arms over his chest, feeling so much smaller than he did before. &ldquo;He was only being friendly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my God,&rdquo; TJ said, his voice full of disgust. There was a muted thump, and Cyrus assumed it was TJ hitting his hand against his leg in exasperation. &ldquo;You call that friendly? Listen to me Cyrus, he was flirting with you.&rdquo; The words came out clipped, dripping with venom, and Cyrus could only begin to wonder why before his mouth took over.</p><p>&ldquo;So what if he was? What&rsquo;s so bad about a guy liking me?&rdquo; Cyrus said, his words coming out choked. If TJ was homophobic, he&rsquo;d never be able to recover from that discovery. He felt the back of his head starting to buzz, his fingers starting to tingle, and his eyes starting to sting. This was the beginning of a panic attack.</p><p>&ldquo;I-&rdquo; TJ started, but was cut off by his own sigh. He took a few deep breaths before his voice came back, this time quieter, almost unheard. &ldquo;Nothing. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what is the problem here?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, a tear threatening to slip as he looked at TJ, who was staring at the ground, head ducked in what looked like humiliation. Suddenly, there was a small, wet spot on the pavement, and TJ was wiping his eyes, turning around. &ldquo;TJ, what is going on?&rdquo; he asked again, this time with more curiosity than conviction. TJ turned around suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;Damnit, Cyrus, I like you! Okay?&rdquo; TJ said, his lungs seeming to take an exhausted breath for him. Maybe it was a sob. Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know. He was, once again, knocked back a step. But this time, the pressure seemed to manifest in his heart, tearing it open and making him lose any sort of control. Tears began to fall down his cheeks, even if he didn&rsquo;t want them to. And he couldn&rsquo;t even move his arms to wipe them again. &ldquo;I like you.&rdquo; The words were more broken that time. Before Cyrus could even think about replying, TJ was already walking away quickly, his hands reaching up to his face.</p><p>Cyrus was simply left on the sidewalk, trying to pinpoint the moment things went bad.</p><p>Now, he&rsquo;s standing at the perimeter of the park, trying to decide whether he should take the step, or double back to where he was, and let them both just forget.</p><p>He can&rsquo;t forget, though. Not after a confession like that. Especially since the feelings aren&rsquo;t unrequited.</p><p>Looking around, the park seems deserted. Kids don&rsquo;t usually come to the park when it starts getting cold, seeing as the sun sets earlier, and parents don&rsquo;t want to parade around a freezing park just so their kids can go down a slide a few times before they lose interest due to their dwindling attention span. It makes for a perfect place for the older kids to hang out during fall and winter.</p><p>He swallows the lump in his throat, closing his eyes and realising just how exhausted he is. Bawling his eyes out tends to have that effect on him, and the fact that they were hand in hand with a panic attack definitely doesn&rsquo;t help. He knows that his eyelashes are crusted with tears, and his cheeks are red and puffy, but if he doesn&rsquo;t do this now, he never will. There will never be a better time.</p><p>Bravely, he steps onto the park property, listening to the crunching of leaves under his shoes, and the whistling of wind in his ears. He&rsquo;s light headed and dizzy, but he has to do this.</p><p>The only time he hesitates is when he starts to near the swings, and he sees the small, far away figure of TJ sitting there, head dipped, and feet barely leaving the ground. He stops for a moment, just simply watching, feeling horrible about everything. Quickly, he takes a deep breath, and starts forward again. As he&rsquo;s walking, the noisy leaves catch TJ&rsquo;s attention, and his head snaps up, staring dumbly at Cyrus before looking down again. Cyrus takes this as the closest thing he&rsquo;ll get to an invitation, and gets closer, sitting down on the swing next to TJ as if he&rsquo;s a feral cat, neither boy daring to say a word.</p><p>Cyrus begins swinging, hoping that the sound of the metal chain will make him brave enough to say what he needs to say. He&rsquo;d even rehearsed it.</p><p>Instead, he starts humming, feeling much more content starting out that way. But words startle him, and he stops swinging.</p><p>&ldquo;Legs go up, legs go down.&rdquo; The words are quiet, and sung with the melody of Cyrus&rsquo; humming. A smile slowly manifests itself on Cyrus&rsquo; face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we make the swing go &lsquo;round.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus starts to feel absolutely ridiculous as TJ sings the words he&rsquo;d made up when he was little, his cheeks burning at the embarrassment of hearing it come from someone else&rsquo;s mouth. At this point, TJ is one of three people who know about the song. And he actually bothered to remember the juvenile lyrics.</p><p>&ldquo;Drag your feet, you&rsquo;ll go slow. The more you drag, the less you go.&rdquo;</p><p>A mutual silence comes over them as Cyrus starts to swing again.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m an idiot, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; TJ asks quietly, words broken. Cyrus has to take a deep breath. Apparently, the conversation part of the argument is happening now.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. That would make me an idiot, too,&rdquo; Cyrus tells him, almost forgetting how to speak for a moment. There&rsquo;s another beat of silence before TJ speaks again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I lost my temper. I know you hate the Scary-Basketball-Guy,&rdquo; he says, still not looking at Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;Only in certain situations. Other times he comes in handy,&rdquo; Cyrus tells him, trying to offer some sort of comic relief. He&rsquo;s really not sure how people handle these situations. He&rsquo;s just kinda winging it.</p><p>&ldquo;I just get protective sometimes. I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo; The words are honest, and raw, and they start splitting Cyrus&rsquo; heart in half, simply because of how sweet they are. He can&rsquo;t help the smile that grows on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I get it. Trust me, if I had any capability of being intimidating, there would have been multiple casualties on my behalf, all from defending you,&rdquo; Cyrus admits. He&rsquo;s not beating around the bush. He doesn&rsquo;t have the time nor the patience for dragging things out. At this statement, TJ laughs, though it sounds more like a scoff.</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, you don&rsquo;t have a mean bone in your body,&rdquo; he says, his voice full of what sounds like longing. It&rsquo;s now or never.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ,&rdquo; he starts, waiting until the older boy finally lifts his head to look at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not alone,&rdquo; he says, looking into his eyes. His face is softer now than it was before, and he looks just as exhausted as Cyrus feels.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re telling me that I didn&rsquo;t totally ruin everything?&rdquo; TJ asks, looking away. There&rsquo;s more humour in his voice than curiosity, the question laced with sarcasm. Cyrus laughs softly, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we just need to stop dragging our feet,&rdquo; he says, biting his lip. When TJ doesn&rsquo;t look at him, he reaches over, placing his hand on top of TJ&rsquo;s on the swing chain, pulling it off and tangling their fingers together, leaving them hanging between them.</p><p>&ldquo;This is terrifying,&rdquo; TJ tells him, his free hand coming up to rub his forehead. Cyrus feels tension in the exact same place, suggesting that TJ must have had quite a similar crying session. The thought sends ice through his blood, and his look softens. He squeezes TJ&rsquo;s hand in reassurance, nodding when he looks at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely. But if we do it together, it&rsquo;s much less scary,&rdquo; Cyrus reminds him. TJ takes a deep breath through his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like you, Underdog,&rdquo; he says, forming his first real smile since before the argument.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like you, too, TJ,&rdquo; Cyrus replies, returning the gesture. Suddenly, everything&rsquo;s changed, and Cyrus isn&rsquo;t sure if he&rsquo;s necessarily ready. Nevertheless, he&rsquo;s here now, and he can&rsquo;t go back.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna go to The Spoon? Maybe start this day over?&rdquo; TJ asks, proving to remain braver than Cyrus by a longshot. Cyrus nods, slowly letting go of TJ&rsquo;s hand and standing up, reaching out again, letting TJ return the gesture. Hand in hand, Cyrus starts to feel content as he faces TJ for the first time in this new, weird era.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Let&rsquo;s start over,&rdquo; he says, starting to walk backwards, pulling TJ along with him as wide smiles begin to take over their frowns, and sheepish conversation fills their silence, full of admiration and newfound mutual feelings. It&rsquo;s as if nothing had even happened, and yet everything still changed.</p></p>",

As we know, the episode where Cyrus comes out, came out (haha I\u2019m funny) October 27, 2017. Now, obviously this was a Friday night. Something you guys should know is that my dad is a football coach for the high school football team in my town. It was the first game of the playoffs which is a pretty big deal in my family, so we went. Meaning I didn\u2019t get to watch the season premiere until that Saturday. Other problem was that I was going to my grandparents house Saturday morning for my cousin\u2019s birthday party. (My grandparents live 2 hours away) Saturday morning, we all pile in the car at 9am to get there in time to help set up. My mom was scrolling through Facebook and asked me, \u201cYou were wanting to watch Andi Mack, right?\u201d I told her yes and she said, \u201cOh, well parents are freaking out over it. \u2018Andi Mack ruined Disney for my child.\u2019 Is what one says. Let me look into it.\u201d Of course I told her not to tell me what happened so I could watch and she said fine. Fast forward to after the party, I\u2019m watching a rerun of the episode, and my mom came in to watch with me. I\u2019m sure she wanted to see what everyone was talking about. So,when that seen came on, she said \u201cYou know it\u2019s ok right?\u201d I said \u201cWhat\u2019s ok?\u201d She said \u201cIt\u2019s ok to watch this show. Those moms on Facebook are being weird because there isn\u2019t anything wrong with him like boys.\u201d And that\u2019s the story of me watching the season 2 premiere.</p>",

As we know, the episode where Cyrus comes out, came out (haha I\u2019m funny) October 27, 2017. Now, obviously this was a Friday night. Something you guys should know is that my dad is a football coach for the high school football team in my town. It was the first game of the playoffs which is a pretty big deal in my family, so we went. Meaning I didn\u2019t get to watch the season premiere until that Saturday. Other problem was that I was going to my grandparents house Saturday morning for my cousin\u2019s birthday party. (My grandparents live 2 hours away) Saturday morning, we all pile in the car at 9am to get there in time to help set up. My mom was scrolling through Facebook and asked me, \u201cYou were wanting to watch Andi Mack, right?\u201d I told her yes and she said, \u201cOh, well parents are freaking out over it. \u2018Andi Mack ruined Disney for my child.\u2019 Is what one says. Let me look into it.\u201d Of course I told her not to tell me what happened so I could watch and she said fine. Fast forward to after the party, I\u2019m watching a rerun of the episode, and my mom came in to watch with me. I\u2019m sure she wanted to see what everyone was talking about. So,when that seen came on, she said \u201cYou know it\u2019s ok right?\u201d I said \u201cWhat\u2019s ok?\u201d She said \u201cIt\u2019s ok to watch this show. Those moms on Facebook are being weird because there isn\u2019t anything wrong with him like boys.\u201d And that\u2019s the story of me watching the season 2 premiere.</p></p>",
