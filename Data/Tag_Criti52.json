With potent spellcasting if he cant use a spell he should be using his cantrip, in 2 more levels sacred flame is going to be a better option than the staff almost every time.</p>",

Jester with her 16 str has a +7 chance to hit with it as opposed to cad\u2019s 10 str which gives him a +4 and can do more base damage with it. Not to mention that as a trickery domain cleric jester can use her duplicate to gain advantage on all her attacks as long as they\u2019re both within 5 feet of an enemy.  Even more, her divine strike deals an extra 1d8 poison damage that should stack with the withering staffs extra 2d8 necrotic. Plus with how Laura plays jester as kind of a warrior cleric who likes to mix it up it would just be more useful to her than cad</p><p>Like I said cad is built for a spell caster, his domain abilities are all geared towards supporting others in battle or boosting his own spell casting. With potent spellcasting if he cant use a spell he should be using his cantrip, in 2 more levels sacred flame is going to be a better option than the staff almost every time.</p>",
