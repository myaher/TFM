And why are the control styles separate\nstars, when nearly all of them before controlled the same way?<br/>\nIt\u2019s the worst mode in this game but it\u2019s not a bad mode. Just painfully\naverage.</p><hr><p>In City\nTrial, you powerup your star by collecting items. Collecting a lot of weight\nmakes your star less slippery, glide lets you fly higher and glide faster, top\nspeed increases your top speed and so on. You start off with a standard star,\nthe Compact Star. It\u2019s quite weak but you\u2019ll also find different stars that you\ncan hop onto instead and find the star that you\u2019d prefer. Make sure that you\u2019re\nnot losing your items or your star by defending yourself against the other\nplayers. Or you could mess up their day, either or.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"337\" data-orig-width=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/782ae04537617cffdf00b34c57f753a3/tumblr_inline_pmqdj8LOwA1v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"337\" data-orig-width=\"420\"/></figure><p><br/>There are also random\nevents that can make your life harder or easier. For example, Dyna Blade can appear and you need to hit her head to defeat her. It\u2019s a little hard to hit here but you\u2019ll get the hang of it. Other events are kinda nice and surprising too, but I need to mention 2 bad ones. One is where the items get bouncy. They\u2019ll bounce really high and it\u2019s kinda just frustrating when you see an item and you have to make sure the item lands where you\u2019d predict it to fall.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7079be4188f7bc2e4356380da73a6452/tumblr_inline_pmqegjNgfA1v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"/></figure><p>But the worst one is \u201cAir Ride machine transformation approaching!\u201d. See, what they\u2019ve intended you to do is fly up to the flying machines, hop off your current machine and jump onto one of the flying ones to take it. But if you take more than one or try to bump into them to bring them from the sky, the game crashes. Maybe the developers had to get that event out of the door and didn\u2019t have time to debug it but it\u2019d have been better to not include at all. But again, the other events are fun.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"299\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58b847676f292954e10965f19b0c7f6c/tumblr_inline_pmqe9o6aBo1v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"240\" data-orig-width=\"299\"/></figure><p>The mode ultimately ends in a\nminigame to determine the winner. It could be about who can fly the highest,\nwho can defeat the most enemies under a time limit, and so on. But you might be\nable to predict it with a hint that can sometimes pop up. If that sounds\nfamiliar, you might be thinking of Super Smash Bros. 3DS\u2019 Smash Run mode. Same\nbasic principle but Kirby Air Ride does it a lot better by having a number of\nsettings that aren\u2019t present in Smash. Like setting the minigame, the time\nlimit, how many items can appear, letting all players compete in the same\narena, basically it\u2019s just way better.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42cd32bf2ce4af81a801ffcdf3c60ad5/tumblr_inline_pmqekxXyjE1v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"/></figure><p>I also think that Kirby Air Ride has way better minigames. I mean, yeah, sure, beating up as many enemies as you can in Smash 3DS is fun and all but you\u2019re not a living dart flying into a target or&hellip; defeating enemies in 3D with a vehicle and stuff. So, yeah, City Trial is fun, chaotic and the best mode in this game. If someone brings up Kirby Air Ride, they\u2019ll bring up this mode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0285df280feddfad847725df918be23d/tumblr_inline_pmqexqtLkF1v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"/></figure><p>Also, HOLY MOLY YOU CAN CONTROL KIRBY IN\nA 3D ENVIRONMENT?!?! JUMPING AND PUFFING UP TOO?!?!?! THAT\u2019S AMAZING!! </p><hr><p>Finally, if\nthis all doesn\u2019t seem enough for you, there\u2019s tons of replay value with\nachievements with a ton of unlockable content. And there\u2019s not just 120\nachievements. Not 240. But 360 of them. But just like what eventually Super\nSmash Bros. Brawl will do, you can skip some of them by using purple boxes. How\ndo you get those? By doing other achievements, of course.<br/>\nAnd some will unlock songs, some will unlock skins, some won\u2019t do anything at\nall. You\u2019ll never know until you do them. Whether on purpose or on accident.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1352\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/813ce0dfbce4497d331acc6989223541/tumblr_inline_pmqew25p2V1v8ihra_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1352\"/></figure><p>Maybe you\u2019re asking\n\u201cwhy would I want Kirby Air Ride when I could get Mario Kart: Double Dash!! or\nF-Zero GX<b>\u201d</b>? That\u2019s because the game doesn\u2019t\nwant to be a chaotic fun-racer, nor a more realistic high speed racer. It kinda\nis parts of both? You could play it competitively but also have fun by messing\nwith the other players. Kinda like the Smash Bros. games, you\u2019ll have fun\neither way. And that\u2019s why I recommend playing it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1352\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8be31b26544e2e9fe55c522d8a7bf8ff/tumblr_inline_pmqf0gQHju1v8ihra_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1352\"/></figure>",

If you fly off a ramp, you can tilt your star\nup into the air to gain height, then fly forwards and land correctly to earn a\nboost.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"421\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d03291ed9ca2645be66ce07625f85b4/tumblr_inline_pmq8qeToul1v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"421\"></figure><p>Besides that, the analog stick is only used for steering.

You can decide how many\nlaps you\u2019ll race, whether or not enemies should appear, heck, maybe you want a\ntime limit instead.<br>\nThe courses themselves make use of a lot of corner drifting but are also\npopulated with tons of enemies. Defeating enemies gives you a little extra\nspeed for a while too so it becomes a balance act of messing with your\nopponents and enemies but also trying to get boosts in various ways.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"421\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/23f33175ec752acbbf7d3c1f913e452f/tumblr_inline_pmqc2ouq501v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"421\"></figure><p>There are also 2 separate time trial modes (one with enemies and a specific number of laps and the other without enemies and infinite laps; saving the best lap time instead) and if you want to get extra\ncompetitive, you can enable a lifebar. Having a lifebar makes a huge difference\non the balancing act. Now you want to defeat your opponents more so than\ngetting boosts but focusing on that too much could also make you lose 1<sup>st</sup>\nplace. See how \u201csimple to play easy to master\u201d just works amazingly well with\nthis? There\u2019s just one flaw with this: There aren\u2019t enough courses, at least in\nmy opinion. What we have is great though. \n<br>\nAnd if you want to get extra unnecessary, you can use a broadband adapter to\nplay it with up to 4 GameCube systems via LAN\u2026 but why would you do that? It\nwill still only support 4 players, so just play 4 player splitscreen with one\nconsole.</p><hr><p>\u201cTop\nRide\u201d\u2019s mode is about races from the top-down perspective. You can choose to\nturn your star left or right or hold the analog stick in the direction it\nshould go. Each of the 7 courses has a different theme with an obstacle or a\ngimmick. Players can pick up various items and abilities.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e699db9d03b135a9cc774d69ab9323e9/tumblr_inline_pmqcjldzeV1v8ihra_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"338\" data-orig-width=\"420\"></figure><p>This mode is\ndefinitely more party orientated.

Drifting, braking,\nabsorbing enemies and using your copy abilities, activating switches and boost\npads&hellip; Everything with just one button.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7eabd3ff41547dc9c6839acce4814c94/tumblr_inline_pmqaz3HUQK1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\nYou could even play the game in one hand and eat pizza in the other! &hellip;Get it?</p><p>&ldquo;Air Ride&rdquo;\nis the racing mode. 9 courses with a ton of options. You can decide how many\nlaps you&rsquo;ll race, whether or not enemies should appear, heck, maybe you want a\ntime limit instead.<br />\nThe courses themselves make use of a lot of corner drifting but are also\npopulated with tons of enemies. Defeating enemies gives you a little extra\nspeed for a while too so it becomes a balance act of messing with your\nopponents and enemies but also trying to get boosts in various ways.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/23f33175ec752acbbf7d3c1f913e452f/tumblr_inline_pmqc2ouq501v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There are also 2 separate time trial modes (one with enemies and a specific number of laps and the other without enemies and infinite laps; saving the best lap time instead) and if you want to get extra\ncompetitive, you can enable a lifebar. Having a lifebar makes a huge difference\non the balancing act. Now you want to defeat your opponents more so than\ngetting boosts but focusing on that too much could also make you lose 1<sup>st</sup>\nplace. See how &ldquo;simple to play easy to master&rdquo; just works amazingly well with\nthis? There&rsquo;s just one flaw with this: There aren&rsquo;t enough courses, at least in\nmy opinion. What we have is great though. \n<br />\nAnd if you want to get extra unnecessary, you can use a broadband adapter to\nplay it with up to 4 GameCube systems via LAN&hellip; but why would you do that? It\nwill still only support 4 players, so just play 4 player splitscreen with one\nconsole.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Top\nRide&rdquo;&rsquo;s mode is about races from the top-down perspective. You can choose to\nturn your star left or right or hold the analog stick in the direction it\nshould go. Each of the 7 courses has a different theme with an obstacle or a\ngimmick. Players can pick up various items and abilities.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e699db9d03b135a9cc774d69ab9323e9/tumblr_inline_pmqcjldzeV1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This mode is\ndefinitely more party orientated. With Top Ride, you can easily conquer 1<sup>st</sup>\nplace with items, while Air Ride rewards good driving skills more.<br /></p><p>\nAnd there are two separate time trials again.<br />\nThere&rsquo;s not much else to say besides mentioning that you can unlock songs from\nolder Kirby games for this mode. And that Kirby looks kinda squished. And there&rsquo;s\nnot much else to say besides that&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ade497428ba7dd517d079d893875f35a/tumblr_inline_pmqcymBCzT1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Wait, that&rsquo;s the issue! There aren&rsquo;t enough courses, all of the stars from Air\nRide are gone (which do return in the next mode)&hellip; Maybe if the courses would be\nbigger, I wouldn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that bad? And why are the control styles separate\nstars, when nearly all of them before controlled the same way?<br />\nIt&rsquo;s the worst mode in this game but it&rsquo;s not a bad mode. Just painfully\naverage.</p><hr /><p>In City\nTrial, you powerup your star by collecting items. Collecting a lot of weight\nmakes your star less slippery, glide lets you fly higher and glide faster, top\nspeed increases your top speed and so on. You start off with a standard star,\nthe Compact Star. It&rsquo;s quite weak but you&rsquo;ll also find different stars that you\ncan hop onto instead and find the star that you&rsquo;d prefer. Make sure that you&rsquo;re\nnot losing your items or your star by defending yourself against the other\nplayers. Or you could mess up their day, either or.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/782ae04537617cffdf00b34c57f753a3/tumblr_inline_pmqdj8LOwA1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />There are also random\nevents that can make your life harder or easier. For example, Dyna Blade can appear and you need to hit her head to defeat her. It&rsquo;s a little hard to hit here but you&rsquo;ll get the hang of it. Other events are kinda nice and surprising too, but I need to mention 2 bad ones. One is where the items get bouncy. They&rsquo;ll bounce really high and it&rsquo;s kinda just frustrating when you see an item and you have to make sure the item lands where you&rsquo;d predict it to fall.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7079be4188f7bc2e4356380da73a6452/tumblr_inline_pmqegjNgfA1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But the worst one is &ldquo;Air Ride machine transformation approaching!&rdquo;. See, what they&rsquo;ve intended you to do is fly up to the flying machines, hop off your current machine and jump onto one of the flying ones to take it. But if you take more than one or try to bump into them to bring them from the sky, the game crashes. Maybe the developers had to get that event out of the door and didn&rsquo;t have time to debug it but it&rsquo;d have been better to not include at all. But again, the other events are fun.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58b847676f292954e10965f19b0c7f6c/tumblr_inline_pmqe9o6aBo1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The mode ultimately ends in a\nminigame to determine the winner. It could be about who can fly the highest,\nwho can defeat the most enemies under a time limit, and so on. But you might be\nable to predict it with a hint that can sometimes pop up. If that sounds\nfamiliar, you might be thinking of Super Smash Bros. 3DS&rsquo; Smash Run mode. Same\nbasic principle but Kirby Air Ride does it a lot better by having a number of\nsettings that aren&rsquo;t present in Smash. Like setting the minigame, the time\nlimit, how many items can appear, letting all players compete in the same\narena, basically it&rsquo;s just way better.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42cd32bf2ce4af81a801ffcdf3c60ad5/tumblr_inline_pmqekxXyjE1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I also think that Kirby Air Ride has way better minigames. I mean, yeah, sure, beating up as many enemies as you can in Smash 3DS is fun and all but you&rsquo;re not a living dart flying into a target or&hellip; defeating enemies in 3D with a vehicle and stuff. So, yeah, City Trial is fun, chaotic and the best mode in this game. If someone brings up Kirby Air Ride, they&rsquo;ll bring up this mode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0285df280feddfad847725df918be23d/tumblr_inline_pmqexqtLkF1v8ihra_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Also, HOLY MOLY YOU CAN CONTROL KIRBY IN\nA 3D ENVIRONMENT?!?! JUMPING AND PUFFING UP TOO?!?!?! THAT&rsquo;S AMAZING!! </p><hr /><p>Finally, if\nthis all doesn&rsquo;t seem enough for you, there&rsquo;s tons of replay value with\nachievements with a ton of unlockable content. And there&rsquo;s not just 120\nachievements. Not 240. But 360 of them. But just like what eventually Super\nSmash Bros. Brawl will do, you can skip some of them by using purple boxes. How\ndo you get those? By doing other achievements, of course.<br />\nAnd some will unlock songs, some will unlock skins, some won&rsquo;t do anything at\nall. You&rsquo;ll never know until you do them. Whether on purpose or on accident.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/813ce0dfbce4497d331acc6989223541/tumblr_inline_pmqew25p2V1v8ihra_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Maybe you&rsquo;re asking\n&ldquo;why would I want Kirby Air Ride when I could get Mario Kart: Double Dash!! or\nF-Zero GX<b>&rdquo;</b>? That&rsquo;s because the game doesn&rsquo;t\nwant to be a chaotic fun-racer, nor a more realistic high speed racer. It kinda\nis parts of both? You could play it competitively but also have fun by messing\nwith the other players. Kinda like the Smash Bros. games, you&rsquo;ll have fun\neither way. And that&rsquo;s why I recommend playing it.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8be31b26544e2e9fe55c522d8a7bf8ff/tumblr_inline_pmqf0gQHju1v8ihra_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",

A super challenging side-scroller platformer\nthat has been simultaneously loved and criticized by fans and critics alike.\nCan a game be too hard for its own good? Lets find out. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"351\" data-orig-width=\"624\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6538466788d81161649f9cd68826cbde/tumblr_inline_pmqe2eJ8a91tegiv4_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"351\" data-orig-width=\"624\"/></figure><p>Gameplay \u2013 To answer the previous question, yes, yes you\ncan. This game\u2019s difficulty is unfair and unbalanced. I am not saying its bad,\nbut ill cover why it is unfair. First of all, enemies, they are the bane of\nthis game. Enemies tend to spawn out of nowhere and in later levels spawn in\nsuch a way its almost impossible to avoid getting hit. This is best seen with the\nroom before the final boss, where enemies rain from the ceiling and just try to\nhover over you while knocking you back and forth. Due to this game\u2019s wonky\nrespawn system, enemies immediately respawn when offscreen, and enemies that\nfly from the corner of the screen can appear infinitely. Look no further than\nthe infamous birds for this example. Some enemy layouts are so complicated or\nso unfairly placed that its almost pure luck if you can escape. A good example\nis this one point in the final level where dozens of flying ninjas at various\nspeeds and elevations bombard you while you platform, and due to the way\nenemies respawn, the bombardment never ends. Now with the negative out of the\nway, lets look at the positive. Level layouts are alright, straightforward and\nstandard. Some of the games more infamous moments are only found late in the\ngame regarding level layout. The cliffside is without a doubt the worst level.\nHowever, there are some good levels in there as well, the first level does a\ngreat job weaning you into the games style. Though it\u2019s a rocky road from\nthere. Some of the platforming feels stiff and Ryu lacks some mobility\nregarding his wall jumping, its easy to get stuck on a top of a wall and get\nhit, or an enemy might just decided to stand at the edge and make it a pain to\nprogress. Ryu fights with a sword, meaning all foes must be very close to\ndamage, various other things, like shuriken or fire balls appear in limited\nqualities. The extra tools can make certain parts a bit easier. Bosses in this\ngame are a mix bag but are not overly difficult with two exceptions. The last 2\nbosses, being Malth and the final boss room, are painfully difficult. Most of\ntheir moves seem unavoidable and losing to them means replaying some of the\nhardest levels in the game! I cannot give this game a very high score in this\ndepartment, its not bad, but it is to frustrating and hard to be enjoyable.\nPlease note that I did beat the game, so I\u2019m not just moaning over not being\nable to beat it. <br/>\nScore \u2013 12/20</p><p>Graphics \u2013 Pretty good. Each level has a color scheme that,\nwhile not realistic, is a constant. Ryu and the enemies don\u2019t clash with the\nbackground, so you will see enemies on the screen along with interactable\ntorches that could be hit for points, health or weapons. There are many enemy\ntypes, and the game can handle a lot of character movement at once. The\ncutscenes between levels look great for their time and are inspired by anime\nfrom the 80s. While some levels can feel dull or look boring, the games overall\ngraphical presentation is up to par.<br/>\nScore \u2013 8/10</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"377\" data-orig-width=\"431\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8adfb67146dc9c1efce879ec211e45b2/tumblr_inline_pmqe2y6nm31tegiv4_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"377\" data-orig-width=\"431\"/></figure><p>Story \u2013 For a game from the 80s, where story was usually\nlocked in the pages of a manual, Ninja Gaiden does tell a story. While this\nstory, if told nowadays might better fit a cartoon than a game made to be taken\nseriously, it works really well. Ryu\u2019s father is supposedly killed in combat,\nand Ryu, armed with the dragon sword seeks revenge. Ryu is hunted by the CIA,\nwhom try to force him to help overthrow a cult trying to revive a demon. There\nis a romantic subplot\u2026kind of. There is a plot point about Ryu\u2019s father and of\ncourse there is the evil demon and the cult leader revealing his evil plans.\nOverall the plot is nothing special and again by today standards, it would be\nconsidered clich\u00e9. This was the 80s though, so this could be one of the most\nenticing game stories of the time. Couple this with the aforementioned\ncutscenes and you have a good solid plot. The game also leaves room for a\nsequel as well, but that\u2019s a review for another day.<br/>\nScore \u2013 7/10</p><p>Replay Ability \u2013 Low, there are no secrets in this game nor\nany elements in the game that are introduced in a subsequent playthrough. While\nsome people speed run or try for high scores, the general audience might try it\nand put it down. Unless it is for nostalgia reasons of course. Given this games\nbrutal nature, I think one playthrough will suffice all but the hardcore Ninja\nGaiden fans. On the plus side, it is short enough to not eat up a day\u2026if the\nplayer in question is good at it.<br/>\nScore \u2013 2/5</p><p>Music \u2013 Pretty good! The majority of the ost is somewhat\ntechno and upbeat. The music compounds the gameplay by being fast paced and\norganized yet hectic as well. Even though there is not much diversity in music,\neach level has its own theme. While it may sound repetitive in some cases, it\nis enjoyable nonetheless. Sound effects are alright, the main sound effects you\nwill be hearing is the sound of the sword swinging and the sound of an item\nbeing picked up. I would recommend giving the ost a listen to.<br/>\nScore \u2013 4/5</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dli5NtaIfjOg%26list%3DPLq87CEQrNX6XUklCRJd8l4UbXigLXYvSj%26index%3D9\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/li5NtaIfjOg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>Overall \u2013 This game is hard, so hard that it negatively\nimpacts the quality of presentation. While this game shines in other forms of\npresentation, it is the fundamental gameplay that undoes it all. There is a\ndifference between fair and balanced hard and unfair hard. Unfortunately, a lot\nof old school hard games had this more unfair spike to it. Now, I think this\ngame is flawed, yes, but its not that bad. It is frustrating but competent with\nlevel design for the most part. If you are looking for a hardcore challenge,\nthen this is a game worth trying, but if you want a genuine tough but\nmanageable old school Nintendo game, look elsewhere.<br/>\nFinal score \u2013 6.6/10 \u2013 so - so</p>",

Ryu\u2019s father is supposedly killed in combat,\nand Ryu, armed with the dragon sword seeks revenge.

This game\u2019s difficulty is unfair and unbalanced. I am not saying its bad,\nbut ill cover why it is unfair. First of all, enemies, they are the bane of\nthis game. Enemies tend to spawn out of nowhere and in later levels spawn in\nsuch a way its almost impossible to avoid getting hit. This is best seen with the\nroom before the final boss, where enemies rain from the ceiling and just try to\nhover over you while knocking you back and forth. Due to this game\u2019s wonky\nrespawn system, enemies immediately respawn when offscreen, and enemies that\nfly from the corner of the screen can appear infinitely. Look no further than\nthe infamous birds for this example. Some enemy layouts are so complicated or\nso unfairly placed that its almost pure luck if you can escape. A good example\nis this one point in the final level where dozens of flying ninjas at various\nspeeds and elevations bombard you while you platform, and due to the way\nenemies respawn, the bombardment never ends. Now with the negative out of the\nway, lets look at the positive. Level layouts are alright, straightforward and\nstandard. Some of the games more infamous moments are only found late in the\ngame regarding level layout. The cliffside is without a doubt the worst level.\nHowever, there are some good levels in there as well, the first level does a\ngreat job weaning you into the games style.
