Yes, he still had lingering, unresolved issues from his time in the Army, and sure, he had what Bucky annoyingly referred to as a criminally untapped ass, and no life outside of work and Peter, but Steve was okay with how his life had turned out because of trusting his instincts.</p><p>Unfortunately, those same instincts had straight up betrayed him by going absolutely haywire upon being exposed to Tony Stark.</p><p><small>Veteran single dad Steve runs a tattoo shop. For his 40th birthday, Pepper arranges for Tony to get that tattoo he always wanted, and he winds up with the mother of all crushes instead. Jumping out of airplanes is one thing, but falling in love is something else entirely. Steve struggles with the idea of actually letting someone into his life. Tony is left trying to keep his heart from being broken while Steve figures things out.</small></p><p><b>Review: <br/></b>Wow what a journey this was! I literally went through so much by reading how Steve and Tony go through <i>so much.</i> It\u2019s has a beautiful build and is such a well constructed story. The more you read, the more you uncover and realize this isn\u2019t a straight forward\u00a0\u201cmeet and get together\u201d fic, you get to see Tony and Steve build a relationship, go through milestones, support each other, love each other, fight for each other, and get their happy ending (I promise it is the happiest of endings!)

He usually took it as a sign to be a\nlittle more upbeat than usual, quietly steering Tony\u2019s thoughts away from\nwhatever was bothering him. </p><p>Tony\u2019s fingers curled and uncurled, his mouth set in a hard\nline. Peter didn\u2019t point it out\u2014he\u2019d learned the first time that mentioning it\njust made Tony quieter and more sullen\u2014but he watched out of the corner of his\neye.</p><p>He started to get more worried when Tony raised his other\nhand to his chest, rubbing at it as if in pain.</p><p>He was finally going to bite the bullet and ask, but FRIDAY\nbeat him to it. \u201cSir, you are exhibiting the early signs of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, FRI,\u201d Tony sighed. </p><p>\u201cBoss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY,\u201d Tony snapped.</p><p>The AI fell silent, and Peter hesitantly turned away,\nfocusing back on his chemistry homework. </p><p>He regretted it when a minute later, he heard a groan and\nthe distinct sound of someone collapsing to the floor.</p><p>Peter whirled around, his heart jumping to his throat as he\nsaw Tony sprawled on the hard floor of the lab, his face slack and flushed.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Peter cried, his voice breaking as he rushed to his\nmentor\u2019s side. \u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having a heart attack,\u201d FRIDAY informed him, her accent\nthick as her words rushed together. \u201cI\u2019ve already alerted medical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I\u2014what do I do?\u201d he hiccupped, gripping frantically\nat Tony\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear Tony breathing. He couldn\u2019t hear his heart\nbeating.</p><p>\u201cPeter, you need to perform CPR,\u201d FRIDAY instructed. </p><p>Peter knew how to give CPR. It was one of the three badges\nhe\u2019d earned in his seven months in Boy Scouts before Ben and May had no longer\nbeen able to afford it. But the instructions were for normal people\u2014people who\ndidn\u2019t have to stop themselves from breaking everything they touched on a daily\nbasis. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peter gasped, nearly hyperventilating. \u201cI could\nhurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is common for ribs to break during CPR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between broken and crushed, FRI! I\ncould kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already dying, Peter,\u201d FRIDAY urged. \u201cWe\u2019re going to\nlose him!\u201d</p><p>Peter whimpered, but he got in the position he remembered.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d FRIDAY barked.</p><p>Peter thought of the tempo he was supposed to stick to\u2014<i>staying alive, staying alive, please for the\nlove of all that is good stay alive\u2014</i>and started to push. </p><p>He heard Tony\u2019s rib snap on the third compression.</p><p>Peter jerked his hands back, choking slightly.</p><p>\u201cKeep going. A little lighter.\u201d </p><p>Tears blurring his vision, Peter resumed. It felt like he\nwas barely pressing down, but with each downward thrust he could hear Tony\u2019s heart\nbeat one more time. One more.

Peter didn\u2019t point it out\u2014he\u2019d learned the first time that mentioning it\njust made Tony quieter and more sullen\u2014but he watched out of the corner of his\neye.</p><p>He started to get more worried when Tony raised his other\nhand to his chest, rubbing at it as if in pain.</p><p>He was finally going to bite the bullet and ask, but FRIDAY\nbeat him to it. \u201cSir, you are exhibiting the early signs of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet, FRI,\u201d Tony sighed. </p><p>\u201cBoss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY,\u201d Tony snapped.</p><p>The AI fell silent, and Peter hesitantly turned away,\nfocusing back on his chemistry homework. </p><p>He regretted it when a minute later, he heard a groan and\nthe distinct sound of someone collapsing to the floor.</p><p>Peter whirled around, his heart jumping to his throat as he\nsaw Tony sprawled on the hard floor of the lab, his face slack and flushed.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Peter cried, his voice breaking as he rushed to his\nmentor\u2019s side. \u201cTony!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having a heart attack,\u201d FRIDAY informed him, her accent\nthick as her words rushed together. \u201cI\u2019ve already alerted medical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I\u2014what do I do?\u201d he hiccupped, gripping frantically\nat Tony\u2019s shoulders. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear Tony breathing. He couldn\u2019t hear his heart\nbeating.</p><p>\u201cPeter, you need to perform CPR,\u201d FRIDAY instructed. </p><p>Peter knew how to give CPR. It was one of the three badges\nhe\u2019d earned in his seven months in Boy Scouts before Ben and May had no longer\nbeen able to afford it. But the instructions were for normal people\u2014people who\ndidn\u2019t have to stop themselves from breaking everything they touched on a daily\nbasis. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peter gasped, nearly hyperventilating. \u201cI could\nhurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is common for ribs to break during CPR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between broken and crushed, FRI!

One more. One more. </p><p>He was panting around his sobs, crying so hard he couldn\u2019t\ndraw in a real breath. </p><p>He broke another rib. </p><p>Peter let out a short yell of fear and desperation and\nguilt.</p><p>\u201cSixty seconds until the medics arrive.

One more. One more.</p><p>Someone knelt on the other side of Tony\u2019s body. Hands fitted\nright next to his own. The person was pushing with him, in the same rhythm,\nready to take over. Another set of hands tried to gently shove Peter away.</p><p>Peter knew he could stop now. He\u2019d just had to hold on until\nthe medics arrived and they were here, but he was the only thing keeping Tony\u2019s\nheart beating and he couldn\u2019t just stop because Tony would <i>die</i>.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok, kid, we\u2019ll take over now,\u201d the second medic said.\nHe took Peter\u2019s wrists and pulled them away, not even commenting when Tony\u2019s\nshirt stuck to them until it ripped.</p><p>The other doctor, a young man whose mouth was set in a\ndetermined line, kept up the CPR. Peter could hear Tony\u2019s heart pumping one\nmore time. One more. One more. </p><p>Peter backed up and sat with his knees pulled up to his\nchest, watching in numb horror as the EMT\u2019s brought out the defibrillators and\nshocked Tony once, twice, three times before they finally got a heartbeat. They\nshoved him on a back board and onto the gurney they\u2019d brought and ran him back\ninto the elevator. Peter listened to it go. </p><p>Then, realizing that Tony was <i>gone</i>, they had <i>taken him</i>,\nPeter bolted to his feet and down the seven flights of stairs separating Tony\u2019s\nlab and the medbay. </p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mr. Stark?\u201d he asked the first person he saw\u2014a stern\nlooking nurse with graying hair. </p><p>\u201cBeing taken care of. Sit,\u201d she ordered, then disappeared\nbehind the STAFF ONLY doors.</p><p>He sat, tears dripping unheeded down his face. He could\nstill hear Tony\u2019s ribs splintering under his hands. </p><p>At some point, Pepper appeared next to him. She looked at\nhis face, her expression soft and compassionate, her eyes failing to hide her\nworry.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter,\u201d she said quietly. Peter swallowed,\nopened his mouth to talk. No words came out.</p><p>Pepper seemed to understand. She sat next to Peter and\nwrapped an arm around his shoulders, pulling him against her side. They waited\ntogether.</p><p><br></p><p>The doctors had come out and pulled Pepper aside unaware\nthat Peter could hear. They told her that there was little to be done. The\ndamage from Afghanistan was too severe. He\u2019d be alright for now, but they had\nno way of knowing if and when another heart attack would happen. She\u2019d gone in\nand talked to Tony, who was awake and recovering, for a while, then she came\nback out and told Peter he could go in. </p><p>His stomach bunching up in nerves, Peter stood and walked to\nthe doorway. As soon as he was at the threshold, he could hear Tony\u2019s heart\nbeating. It soothed him, if only a little. He took a deep breath and kept\ngoing.</p><p>Tony smiled at him as he approached. \u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter muttered. He cautiously sat in the\nseat next to Tony\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was a surprisingly un-peppy hello,\u201d Tony\nobserved mildly. \u201cSad I didn\u2019t kick the bucket so you could get your\ninheritance early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d Peter snapped without thinking. He crossed\nhis arms over his chest and slumped into the chair, scowling at the floor.</p><p>Tony held up one hand placatingly. \u201cOk, sorry. Just trying\nto lighten the mood.\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cKid, come on, you\u2019re\u2026 well, I was going to say you\u2019re\nkilling me, but that seems rather tactless given the situation,\u201d Tony\ncontinued. </p><p>Tears filled Peter\u2019s eyes. He hoped Tony wouldn\u2019t notice,\nbut immediately Tony reached out a hand and tried to sit up.</p><p>\u201cPete, what\u2019s wro\u2014\u201d he cut off, a strangled gasp of pain\nescaping him. Peter flinched, unconsciously pushing himself farther from Tony\nas if his mere proximity was hurting the man. </p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Tony wheezed. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Just give me a\nsecond.\u201d</p><p>Teeth clenched so hard his jaw hurt, Peter stayed stock\nstill while Tony got his breathing back under control. </p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d Tony murmured, \u201cI\u2019m good now. Kid, come here.\u201d He didn\u2019t\ngive Peter a choice when he seized the kid\u2019s wrist and tugged him closer,\nforcing him to sit on the side of the hospital bed. </p><p>Peter held himself stiffly, careful not to even brush against\nTony. When Tony tried to shift his grip from Peter\u2019s wrist to his hand, Peter\npulled away.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony said, sounding hurt. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you touch me?\u201d</p><p>Bottom lip trembling as his vision blurred, Peter finally\nwhispered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked in surprise. \u201cWhat, because of the-the ribs? I\nbroke more testing my first Iron Man suit, buddy. They\u2019ll heal. It\u2019s ok.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head. He drew an uneven breath. \u201cI could\nfeel them break. I could <i>hear </i>them\nbreak. And I was barely even pushing, I could have\u2026 I could have crushed your\nchest on accident, I still could.\u201d Peter paused, took another ragged breath,\nthe next sentence spilling out before he could stop it. \u201cAnd it\u2019s even worse\ncause you\u2019re not some random criminal, you\u2019re my\u2026 my Tony,\u201d he finished\nlamely, his cheeks flushing as he wiped at his eyes.</p><p>The corner of Tony\u2019s mouth quirked up. \u201cYour Tony.\u201d It didn\u2019t\nsound like a question, but an agreement.</p><p>Peter sniffled. \u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d </p><p>Peter stared resolutely down at the pale blue blanket.</p><p>\u201cPeter Benjamin,\u201d Tony said softly. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Tony had never used his middle name before. Peter slowly\nlifted his head, meeting Tony\u2019s fond gaze. </p><p>\u201cYou saved me.\u201d His voice was firm and honest.\nUnquestionable. \u201cYou saved me. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Peter swiped a hand across his face, banishing the last of\nhis tears. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again,\u201d he commanded, his voice shakier than he\u2019d\nlike it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Tony agreed, smiling. He raised a hand\nas if to grasp Peter\u2019s shoulder, but he couldn\u2019t quite reach without sitting up\nand aggravating his broken ribs. He changed tactics, once again wrapping his\nfingers around Peter\u2019s wrist. He pulled it toward him, raising Peter\u2019s hand and\npressing a soft kiss to his knuckles. \u201cMy Peter.\u201d </p><p>Peter blushed, making Tony\u2019s smile broaden. Peter carefully slumped\nforward and buried his face in Tony\u2019s shoulder, hiding his embarrassment. He\nfelt Tony\u2019s fingers combing through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYour Peter,\u201d he muttered in agreement. </p><p>He could hear Tony\u2019s heart beat one more time. One more. One\nmore. \u00a0 \u00a0</p>",
