Being Tony Stark\u2019s <i>\u201clittle one\u201d </i>gave you an advantage with the game meaning you were almost always around the boy. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s quite funny the reactions that you get from the boy, like yesterday for instance, your hand rubbed on his thigh making him turn a bright red that\u2019s traveled down his neck to be covered by his grey shirt. You leaned over and basically purred in his ear , \u201cLook at you blush handsome..I wonder, does that blush go all the way down?\u201d His stuttering voice would become high pitched as he replied with a <i>stop</i>.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today you wanted to try something different, you wanted to tease the boy a little, make him crave your touch. Your goal was to have him begging for you to even just put a finger on him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201c(Y/N) come here, come here.\u201d Your father beckoned you towards him with a smile, he was practically jumping with excitement. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you want to show me Pops?\u201d You leaned over to look at the tablet.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis!\u201d He pushed the tablet so you have a better view, you looked over two see two suit designs similar to each other. \u201cPeter and-\u201c</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMr. Stark, Sir!\u201d A boyish voice rang through the house cutting off Tony. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIn here Peter!\u201d Your father called out. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter walked in to see both Starks looking at a tablet as Tony waved him over. Peter stood in-between the two, your body not even touching his which made him wonder. \u201cPeter, (Y/N), so I\u2019ve been cooking up some ideas for new suits for you guys and these are the designs I came up with.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You reached your arm over, making Peter shutter, to point at a part of the suit. Peter zoned out as you asked your father questions, his mind was going wild. Usually you\u2019re closer to him but this time you didn\u2019t even brush against him even when you reached over. Oh how he wished your hand brush against him. He felt selfish and confused of how much he craved your touch.</p><p>\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd77 </p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You plopped down next to Peter taking  the remote from the table flipping it to a different channel. \u201cHey I was watching that!\u201d He said reaching towards the remote, You scooted over and held the remote away from him . \u201cNot anymore Spidy.\u201d He continued to reach almost touching you, before he could you threw the remote on his lap and adventured off somewhere else in the tower. Peter looked towards you, usually you would be all over him. Teasing him was something you usually did, you would drag your hand over his body making him a whimper. You would purr out something along the times of \u201cIf you want it, kiss me first\u201d or \u201cIf you want it , come and get it\u201d.</p><p>\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd77 </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peter, Your father and yourself decided to have a movie night. You sat on the other side of Tony which made Peter whimper, he didn\u2019t understand what he did. Did he say something? Did he do something? You would always sit next to him during movie nights, you would touch him in ways you shouldn\u2019t around other people but you found it a game, how long can Peter go before making a sound? But here you were not next to him leaving him in his thoughts that blamed him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few movies you yawned, \u201cDad I\u2019m going to head to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He said a goodnight and shooed you off too involved with the movie. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You sat In your bed, reading a book when your door slammed open.\u00a0\u201cWhat did i do?\u201d Peter questioned quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat do you mean Peter?\u201d You set down the book giving your full attention to the boy who now closed your door.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know what I mean (Y/N).\u201d Peter glared.<br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonestly Pete I don\u2019t, what do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you talked to me or touched me all day?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve talked to you.\u201d At your statement Peter\u2019s face lit up red.<br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know what I mean! Usually you\u2019re always touching me every chance you can get but today.. today you\u2019re avoiding me like.. like the plague!\u201d His face got brighter, if that was even possible, smoke seemed to almost pour out his ears as he stalked towards you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t anymore, maybe I found someone.\u201d You winced at your own statement, how were you able to tell that to this sensitive boy without breaking? Your eyes met his as they seemed to gloss over, his lips trembled.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve.. You\u2019ve found someone? When? Was I never good enough?

                "content": "<p><h2><b>Mess | Peter Parker </b></h2><p><i>This is my first writing thingy on here, hopefully y&rsquo;all enjoy.</i> <i>Also enjoy a little bit of&nbsp; sub!peter</i></p><p><i>Requests are open.</i></p><p>&#128375;&#128375;&#128375; </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You made it a game to see how many times you can make Peter a mess around you. Being Tony Stark&rsquo;s <i>&ldquo;little one&rdquo; </i>gave you an advantage with the game meaning you were almost always around the boy. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s quite funny the reactions that you get from the boy, like yesterday for instance, your hand rubbed on his thigh making him turn a bright red that&rsquo;s traveled down his neck to be covered by his grey shirt. You leaned over and basically purred in his ear , &ldquo;Look at you blush handsome..I wonder, does that blush go all the way down?&rdquo; His stuttering voice would become high pitched as he replied with a <i>stop</i>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today you wanted to try something different, you wanted to tease the boy a little, make him crave your touch. Your goal was to have him begging for you to even just put a finger on him.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;(Y/N) come here, come here.&rdquo; Your father beckoned you towards him with a smile, he was practically jumping with excitement. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you want to show me Pops?&rdquo; You leaned over to look at the tablet.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;This!&rdquo; He pushed the tablet so you have a better view, you looked over two see two suit designs similar to each other. &ldquo;Peter and-&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Mr. Stark, Sir!&rdquo; A boyish voice rang through the house cutting off Tony. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;In here Peter!&rdquo; Your father called out. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter walked in to see both Starks looking at a tablet as Tony waved him over. Peter stood in-between the two, your body not even touching his which made him wonder. &ldquo;Peter, (Y/N), so I&rsquo;ve been cooking up some ideas for new suits for you guys and these are the designs I came up with.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You reached your arm over, making Peter shutter, to point at a part of the suit. Peter zoned out as you asked your father questions, his mind was going wild. Usually you&rsquo;re closer to him but this time you didn&rsquo;t even brush against him even when you reached over. Oh how he wished your hand brush against him. He felt selfish and confused of how much he craved your touch.</p><p>&#128375;&#128375;&#128375; </p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You plopped down next to Peter taking  the remote from the table flipping it to a different channel. &ldquo;Hey I was watching that!&rdquo; He said reaching towards the remote, You scooted over and held the remote away from him . &ldquo;Not anymore Spidy.&rdquo; He continued to reach almost touching you, before he could you threw the remote on his lap and adventured off somewhere else in the tower. Peter looked towards you, usually you would be all over him. Teasing him was something you usually did, you would drag your hand over his body making him a whimper. You would purr out something along the times of &ldquo;If you want it, kiss me first&rdquo; or &ldquo;If you want it , come and get it&rdquo;.</p><p>&#128375;&#128375;&#128375; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter, Your father and yourself decided to have a movie night. You sat on the other side of Tony which made Peter whimper, he didn&rsquo;t understand what he did. Did he say something? Did he do something? You would always sit next to him during movie nights, you would touch him in ways you shouldn&rsquo;t around other people but you found it a game, how long can Peter go before making a sound? But here you were not next to him leaving him in his thoughts that blamed him.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a few movies you yawned, &ldquo;Dad I&rsquo;m going to head to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He said a goodnight and shooed you off too involved with the movie. </p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You sat In your bed, reading a book when your door slammed open.&nbsp;&ldquo;What did i do?&rdquo; Peter questioned quietly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean Peter?&rdquo; You set down the book giving your full attention to the boy who now closed your door.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You know what I mean (Y/N).&rdquo; Peter glared.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly Pete I don&rsquo;t, what do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you talked to me or touched me all day?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to you.&rdquo; At your statement Peter&rsquo;s face lit up red.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You know what I mean! Usually you&rsquo;re always touching me every chance you can get but today.. today you&rsquo;re avoiding me like.. like the plague!&rdquo; His face got brighter, if that was even possible, smoke seemed to almost pour out his ears as he stalked towards you.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe I can&rsquo;t anymore, maybe I found someone.&rdquo; You winced at your own statement, how were you able to tell that to this sensitive boy without breaking? Your eyes met his as they seemed to gloss over, his lips trembled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve.. You&rsquo;ve found someone? When? Was I never good enough? I&rsquo;ll be good enough! I can be, I really can!&rdquo; Hot tears poured down his cheeks, you couldn&rsquo;t take it.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Peter-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I can be good enough, I can!&rdquo; He fell on his knees, head clenched in his hands whimpering. You rushed towards him wrapping your arms around him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better, huh?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter, no-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Peter if you don&rsquo;t shut up i&rsquo;m going to shove my foot in your mouth.&rdquo; He lifted his head and held a disgust face.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now that I have your attention, I wanted to tell you that I didn&rsquo;t mean for any of this-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What?! How can you say that-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;PETER!&rdquo; You screamed loudly, breathing in deeply you continued.&nbsp;&ldquo; I didn&rsquo;t mean for any of this to get to far, I was just trying to tease you a little. I&rsquo;m sorry Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peters arms wrapped around you, kissing every inch of your face.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever do that again, I was a mess!&rdquo;</p></p>",
