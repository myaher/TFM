They are not even hot.&rdquo; Now that ticked me off because to me it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are &ldquo;hot&rdquo; or not they put their all into making all of their listeners happy.  I then answered them with a question of my own. &ldquo;Why the hell do you listen to that rap music that is way to mature for someone like you to handle.&rdquo; They were taken a back because I am a very patient person and I have never talked to them like that. Even though I didn&rsquo;t show it I was pissed. I then kept going and said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t listen to them if they are &quot;hot&rdquo; or not, now don&rsquo;t get me wrong they are all attractive men, but they are more then just that they bring me happiness like other fans around the world. They perform like it is their last time they will ever be on stage. They went through struggles that you can&rsquo;t even imagine, unlike the artists that you listen to. Bts are always greatful for everything they have, every time they get an award you can see it in their eyes, they are greatful. And their music is basically a story they are telling us, some happy and some sad. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, even if some fans will never meet them, bts and their fans feel like a family. One of the best part about them is that they are all unique and different from one another, you can tell by the way they sing or rap. They all have the passion to make their fans happy, even if they are tired and hurt they will still be there to perform. Now I get that some peeple don&rsquo;t like this type of genre but at least respect the fact that they climbed their way up the latter with their blood, sweat, and tears. They have made records that the guys you listen to will never make in a million years.&ldquo; Then I walked away. </p><p>In the end they were so pissed at me and have not talked to me since.

what was\nmissing. \u00a0It was also one of the few days\nthroughout the year that she didn\u2019t work, but she found herself unable to stay\ninside for long. \u00a0In the afternoon, after\na turkey sandwich, she bundled herself up and headed to a park. \u00a0One glimpse told her that Yoongi was still\ngone. \u00a0She had been fearing the worse for\nhim, that his brains were splattered in a pattern above his bed, or an array of\npills were scattered around his body, or one stray match would explode the gas\nhe had slowly leaked out to engulf him. \nThe way he smoked, the last option might have been his way to go. \u00a0Any day now the smell would finally penetrate\nthe door that she stopped by every morning and she would finally know that she\nwas right, that she hadn\u2019t helped at all, and that her neighbor\u2014Yoongi\u2014was\ndead. \u00a0She regretted now not taking his\nnumber as well; she knew no one who knew him, and she wasn\u2019t going to call the\npolice.</p><!-- more --><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWithout\nphysical proof, they could have no cause for forced entry.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nshe had found herself checking the obituaries and missing person reports\nanyway. \u00a0She did every day for work,\nanyway, to check up on old cases and be on the lookout for any new ones.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nwasn\u2019t really sure what she wanted to find, or what she expected.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nwhen the sun was setting, she returned from her walk, and there he was,\noutside, smoking, and she was sure he saw her as she saw him, but, not wanting\nto break the spell, she said and did nothing except ascend the steps until she\nwas in front of her door. \u00a0From there she\ncould tell he really was back; his hair had aged three weeks, and had suddenly\nbeen bleached blonde, and he was fully dressed, but apart from that, his\nfingers went to his mouth and out in the same habitual manner.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWelcome\nback,\u201d she said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNice\nflannel.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d \u00a0She didn\u2019t know what she had expected, but it\nwasn\u2019t as painful as she thought it would be. \nHe was far from forthcoming, but his eyes were responsive, and she could\ntell something had changed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\ndid you actually get cold, or?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNah,\nI just tend to get dressed when I go out.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\nright, for the best,\u201d Charlie said. \n\u201cFamily?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHell\nno,\u201d he said, a puff of smoke releasing them from him. \u201cJust got back.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cwhere were you?\u201d \u00a0She was\ncloser to him now, and while the smoke repelled her, something in him had\nsoftened and was even inviting. \u00a0That was\na possibility. \u00a0Or Charlie was just dying\nfor anyone to be close to on this accursed holiday. \u00a0There was a power in shared loneliness. \u00a0She had learned that too late in some cases.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nwhen I told my sponsor what happened he insisted I check myself in. \u00a0So I was on a 72-hour suicide watch that\nturned into three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d\nCharlie said, but her breath disappeared as he rolled up his flannel sleeves to\nshow her all of his freshly made scars. \nThe knowledge that he may not even feel her empowered her to softly run\nher fingers along them. \u00a0\u201cI was really\nworried about you.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\nhe said, his fingers faltering. \u00a0He took\na step away from her and stepped out his cigarette. \u00a0\u201cYou wanna come in for a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nopened the door, and for want of company or pure curiosity, Charlie followed\nhim in.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHelplessness\nwas not going to beat him. \u00a0He had beaten\nthese thoughts and feelings before, so this time shouldn\u2019t be any harder.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nit was. \u00a0Because every day was getting\nharder, because every day was added to the next. \u00a0He\u2019d just lost it for a bit, for a few\ndays. \u00a0That\u2019s what he always allowed\nhimself to believe. \u00a0And the meds would\nwork better this time. \u00a0He already felt\nbetter. \u00a0Woozier, sure, and more\ndulled. \u00a0He had seen Charlie touch his\narm, but he had felt nothing.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ncould feel the smoke against his throat, though, and he could feel the steaming\ntea on his tongue. \u00a0And he could see\nCharlie eyeing his apartment. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t\nas clean as hers; he had more junk sitting around taking up room, but he had\ncleaned it when he had come home earlier that day. \u00a0A musty smell remained, but he could open\nwindows when she left.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nhad taken off her coat, and he could see her collarbone above her sweater, and\nhe followed her eyes around his apartment.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nmessy, sorry,\u201d he said, suddenly, surprisingly, embarrassed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\njust got back,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m just admiring your posters.\u201d \u00a0Stylish <i>The</i>\n<i>Black Knight Rises, Scott Pilgrim, Harry\nPotter, Kingsmen, Fargo, </i>and <i>Mad Max </i>posters\nlined his walls, some peeling and tearing in the corners. \u00a0They had been up for three years, and he\nthought nothing of them now.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMmm. \u00a0So you\u2019re a social worker?\u201d he said, and\nCharlie struggled to remember for a second giving him her card, but she also supposed\nhe could have found that information out easily.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAny\ngood?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDepends\non what you mean by good,\u201d she said, faltering again. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a question she had been asked\nbefore.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou help kids?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. \u00a0Those that I can.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSometimes\nthey don\u2019t want help. \u00a0Sometimes\npaperwork gets in the way. \u00a0Sometimes\nthere doesn\u2019t seem to be a solution.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWork\nwith any kids like me?\u201d he said, nonchalantly sipping his tea. \u00a0She, of course, didn\u2019t know what he\nmeant. \u00a0Suicidal? \u00a0Smoker? \nSeemingly without a family or job? \nOf course. \u00a0But an obvious\nquestion wasn\u2019t always so obvious.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean \u2018like you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d he said, suddenly pulling down his sleeve again and running his fingers\nalong his arm, the bumps in the road. \nAnd suddenly Charlie was angry.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSuicidal? \u00a0Yeah. \nIf that\u2019s what you mean, then yeah, I work with kids \u2018like you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd\nyou help them liked you helped me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nsure,\u201d she said, putting her cup down for fear her shaking would show, \u201cwhen I\ncan.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndo you know what to say?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t. \u00a0Not really. \u00a0You go through a lot of training. \u00a0But sometimes that doesn\u2019t work. \u00a0So then you just have to be good at reading\npeople and improv from there.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou good at reading people?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nlike to think so. \u00a0I\u2019m good at listening,\nand that\u2019s part, most, of it,\u201d Charlie said, meeting Yoongi\u2019s stare. \u00a0Neither of their eyes faltered beyond blinks.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHave\nyou ever not saved someone?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCharlie said casually, \u201cof course.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t\nsave \u2018em all, huh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwasn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nenough training, huh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nCharlie said, \u201cplenty of training. \u00a0Not\nenough experience.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWho\nwas it?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl?\u201d Yoongi said, and he watched as Charlie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u00a0She may have training in reading people, but\nso did he. \u00a0His years on the streets had\ntaught him plenty of ways to catch a liar.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl,\u201d Charlie repeated.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you just tell me? \u00a0I mean, we\u2019ve\ncome this far.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThis\nfar?\u201d </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFor\nfuck\u2019s sake, Charlie, you almost saw me kill myself. \u00a0And, arguably, you saved me. \u00a0I probably wouldn\u2019t be here if you hadn\u2019t\nstopped me. \u00a0I don\u2019t know about you, and\nI admit this is hard to admit, but, God, I feel like that connected us\nsomehow. \u00a0Maybe that\u2019s stupid, but.\u201d \u00a0Charlie sighed and looked at the hallway,\nwondering if his room was around the corner, wondering what was hiding in his\ncloset.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019d\nbetter go,\u201d she said, standing up. \u00a0Yoongi\nwatched her but didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d\nYoongi barely muttered under his breath. </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cLook,\nI hate Thanksgiving, you know? \u00a0It makes\nme feel insanely sentimental. \u00a0My\nfeelings are all fucked up. \u00a0And seeing\nyou didn\u2019t help. \u00a0I just mean,\u201d she said,\nholding her hands out of front of her and trying to wipe out everything she\njust said, \u201cI agree with you. \u00a0I haven\u2019t\nstopped thinking about you since you got down off that wall, okay? \u00a0I know we\u2019re connected, but I don\u2019t really\nknow what that means, and I\u2019d rather figure that out before I resort to getting\nswept up in some emotional wave. \u00a0And I\nknow that makes me sound like a complete ass,\u201d she said, and was relieved to\nreceive a smile, \u201cbut it\u2019s instinct to push back against connections for me\nwhile simultaneously wanting them. \nThat\u2019s what my training\u2019s been in, or something.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nYoongi said, walking her to the door. \n\u201cJust remember I may not feel you push, but I do have feelings.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nCharlie said, turning back around outside to look at Yoongi. \u00a0He didn\u2019t look like a Yoongi; not round or\nsmooth at all; leaner and more scarred than he should be, than anyone should\nbe.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nhey, I\u2019m only joking,\u201d he said, grinning an irresistible grin that quickly\ndissolved when Charlie actually pushed him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d\nshe said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhoa,\nshit, I didn\u2019t mean actually push me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nsay that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat? \u00a0Gah,\u201d Yoongi said as she pushed him lighter\nthis time.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nsay you\u2019re kidding if you\u2019re not. \u00a0That\u2019s\nthe kind of talk that will make people stop paying attention to you. \u00a0Don\u2019t cry wolf.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nalright,\u201d he said, \u201cstop pushing me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nyou feel that?\u201d Charlie said, her hand still on Yoongi\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno,\u201d he said, picking her hand off of his chest.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\nwas my sister,\u201d Charlie said, and Yoongi held onto her. \u00a0\u201cWhen I was fourteen. \u00a0She\u2019d been depressed for years, but my\nparents didn\u2019t take her seriously. \u00a0She\nlooked fine. \u00a0And then one day on our way\nhome from school she jumped in front of the train.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nYoongi said, loosening his grip on her hand. \n\u201cIn front of you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight\nin front of me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Yoongi muttered, and\nthen lamely her hand dropped from his. \nBut before she could stick them back in her coat pockets, he wrapped his\narms around her. \u00a0They felt like limp\nnoodles, and he knew he had found his hands behind her, and he knew his face\nwas pressed gently against her hair, but he felt so little, and he was afraid\nshe would feel less. \u00a0But he was warmer\nthan she expected, and her shoulders slackened, and she rested her forehead on\nhis shoulder and took a deep breath. \u00a0But\nhe smelled so much like smoke. \u00a0She\npushed him gently away, coughing.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\nsorry,\u201d Yoongi said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay,\u201d Charlie said in-between coughs. \n\u201cMy body just really hates smoke.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncan\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks\nfor the tea,\u201d Charlie said before slipping away. \u00a0And as soon as his door was shut, he slipped\noff his shoes and his shirt and slipped into bed, waiting to slip into sleep.</p><hr><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nalways slept with her phone beside her and her notifications on. \u00a0Not because anyone ever called\u2014besides a few\ncases of drunk friends desperate for a ride in college\u2014but because she had\npromised every friend she would always be available. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t an empty promise; she meant what she\nsaid and said what she meant. \u00a0But\nhaven\u2019t not met anyone like her, most people did not take her seriously. \u00a0So when her phone buzzed, she immediately\nwoke up, her heart racing and adrenaline pumping, ready to deal with an\nemergency. \u00a0The phone light temporarily\nblinded her, but then she read the time and the text:</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nUnknown\nnumber: You up? (2:42AM)</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe had received\nplenty of random calls and texts; it was part of having a phone these\ndays. \u00a0And she had received plenty of\nprank calls and texts; it was part of giving your phone number away to\nteenagers. \u00a0And she had received plenty\nof \u201cbooty calls\u201d and unsolicited inappropriate pictures; it was part of being a\nwoman. \u00a0But her sense that someone could\nbe in danger was too strong, so she had to reply.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charlie: Who is this? (2:44AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unknown number: Ouch. \u00a0Yoongi (2:45AM)</p><p>Charlie sat up in\nbed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charlie: Oh shit, sorry, didn\u2019t have\nyour number (2:45AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi: Ah yeah (2:45AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi: So I guess you\u2019re up.\n(2:46AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charlie: Am now (2:46AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi: Did I wake you up?? (2:46AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charlie: Yeah (2:47AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi: Shit, sorry, go back to\nsleep. (2:47AM)</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charlie: What\u2019s up?

(2:54AM)</p><p>Charlie got out of\nbed, shuffling down the hall and to the front door. \u00a0She flicked on the outside light and undid\nthe latch. \u00a0Then she leaned against the\ncounter and closed her eyes. \u00a0Her phone\nbuzzed again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi: Ok (2:58AM)</p><p>Charlie opened the\ndoor, and there he was, minus his shoes and shirt again, but this seemed to be\nhow she recognized him best. \u00a0She\nmotioned for him to come in and then shut and locked the door behind him. \u00a0She shuffled back down the hall, but at the\ndoorway turned around as he stood in the kitchen.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on,\u201d she whispered, her eyes\nhalf open. \u00a0He followed but found himself\nsuddenly in an odd position. \u00a0He had not\nexpected her to be up. \u00a0Or to\nrespond. \u00a0Or to invite him over. \u00a0Or to care. \nHe stood again at her bedroom door and watched her get back into bed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, a little\nexasperated, patting the bed beside her. \nBut he lingered for a moment, the glow of her lamp revealing a patchwork\nquilt of various flowers. \u00a0Two plants sat\nin her window sill, and a picture he couldn\u2019t make out sat on her dresser. \u00a0She had already slid down under the covers\nand was reaching to turn out the light, so he hurried\u2014while still tiptoeing\nlike an idiot\u2014to climb into bed beside her. \nHe could tell it was warmer, and the smell of lavender seemed to\nsurround him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTwo rules,\u201d he heard Charlie\nwhisper, and he lay on his side to look at her in the dark. \u00a0\u201cNo touching, and no getting upset if I fall\nasleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, feeling like\nhe was at a sleepover at the cool kid\u2019s house. \nNow that he was here, he was afraid to say or do anything for fear of\nbeing kicked out. \u00a0So he didn\u2019t, and\nCharlie didn\u2019t seem to care, as she was soon asleep. \u00a0</p>",

what was\nmissing. \u00a0It was also one of the few days\nthroughout the year that she didn\u2019t work, but she found herself unable to stay\ninside for long. \u00a0In the afternoon, after\na turkey sandwich, she bundled herself up and headed to a park. \u00a0One glimpse told her that Yoongi was still\ngone. \u00a0She had been fearing the worse for\nhim, that his brains were splattered in a pattern above his bed, or an array of\npills were scattered around his body, or one stray match would explode the gas\nhe had slowly leaked out to engulf him. \nThe way he smoked, the last option might have been his way to go. \u00a0Any day now the smell would finally penetrate\nthe door that she stopped by every morning and she would finally know that she\nwas right, that she hadn\u2019t helped at all, and that her neighbor\u2014Yoongi\u2014was\ndead. \u00a0She regretted now not taking his\nnumber as well; she knew no one who knew him, and she wasn\u2019t going to call the\npolice.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWithout\nphysical proof, they could have no cause for forced entry.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nshe had found herself checking the obituaries and missing person reports\nanyway. \u00a0She did every day for work,\nanyway, to check up on old cases and be on the lookout for any new ones.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nwasn\u2019t really sure what she wanted to find, or what she expected.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nwhen the sun was setting, she returned from her walk, and there he was,\noutside, smoking, and she was sure he saw her as she saw him, but, not wanting\nto break the spell, she said and did nothing except ascend the steps until she\nwas in front of her door. \u00a0From there she\ncould tell he really was back; his hair had aged three weeks, and had suddenly\nbeen bleached blonde, and he was fully dressed, but apart from that, his\nfingers went to his mouth and out in the same habitual manner.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWelcome\nback,\u201d she said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNice\nflannel.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d \u00a0She didn\u2019t know what she had expected, but it\nwasn\u2019t as painful as she thought it would be. \nHe was far from forthcoming, but his eyes were responsive, and she could\ntell something had changed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\ndid you actually get cold, or?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNah,\nI just tend to get dressed when I go out.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\nright, for the best,\u201d Charlie said. \n\u201cFamily?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHell\nno,\u201d he said, a puff of smoke releasing them from him. \u201cJust got back.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cwhere were you?\u201d \u00a0She was\ncloser to him now, and while the smoke repelled her, something in him had\nsoftened and was even inviting. \u00a0That was\na possibility. \u00a0Or Charlie was just dying\nfor anyone to be close to on this accursed holiday. \u00a0There was a power in shared loneliness. \u00a0She had learned that too late in some cases.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nwhen I told my sponsor what happened he insisted I check myself in. \u00a0So I was on a 72-hour suicide watch that\nturned into three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d\nCharlie said, but her breath disappeared as he rolled up his flannel sleeves to\nshow her all of his freshly made scars. \nThe knowledge that he may not even feel her empowered her to softly run\nher fingers along them. \u00a0\u201cI was really\nworried about you.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\nhe said, his fingers faltering. \u00a0He took\na step away from her and stepped out his cigarette. \u00a0\u201cYou wanna come in for a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nopened the door, and for want of company or pure curiosity, Charlie followed\nhim in.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHelplessness\nwas not going to beat him. \u00a0He had beaten\nthese thoughts and feelings before, so this time shouldn\u2019t be any harder.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nit was. \u00a0Because every day was getting\nharder, because every day was added to the next. \u00a0He\u2019d just lost it for a bit, for a few\ndays. \u00a0That\u2019s what he always allowed\nhimself to believe. \u00a0And the meds would\nwork better this time. \u00a0He already felt\nbetter. \u00a0Woozier, sure, and more\ndulled. \u00a0He had seen Charlie touch his\narm, but he had felt nothing.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ncould feel the smoke against his throat, though, and he could feel the steaming\ntea on his tongue. \u00a0And he could see\nCharlie eyeing his apartment. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t\nas clean as hers; he had more junk sitting around taking up room, but he had\ncleaned it when he had come home earlier that day. \u00a0A musty smell remained, but he could open\nwindows when she left.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nhad taken off her coat, and he could see her collarbone above her sweater, and\nhe followed her eyes around his apartment.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nmessy, sorry,\u201d he said, suddenly, surprisingly, embarrassed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\njust got back,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m just admiring your posters.\u201d \u00a0Stylish <i>The</i>\n<i>Black Knight Rises, Scott Pilgrim, Harry\nPotter, Kingsmen, Fargo, </i>and <i>Mad Max </i>posters\nlined his walls, some peeling and tearing in the corners. \u00a0They had been up for three years, and he\nthought nothing of them now.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMmm. \u00a0So you\u2019re a social worker?\u201d he said, and\nCharlie struggled to remember for a second giving him her card, but she also supposed\nhe could have found that information out easily.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAny\ngood?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDepends\non what you mean by good,\u201d she said, faltering again. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a question she had been asked\nbefore.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou help kids?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. \u00a0Those that I can.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSometimes\nthey don\u2019t want help. \u00a0Sometimes\npaperwork gets in the way. \u00a0Sometimes\nthere doesn\u2019t seem to be a solution.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWork\nwith any kids like me?\u201d he said, nonchalantly sipping his tea. \u00a0She, of course, didn\u2019t know what he\nmeant. \u00a0Suicidal? \u00a0Smoker? \nSeemingly without a family or job? \nOf course. \u00a0But an obvious\nquestion wasn\u2019t always so obvious.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean \u2018like you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d he said, suddenly pulling down his sleeve again and running his fingers\nalong his arm, the bumps in the road. \nAnd suddenly Charlie was angry.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSuicidal? \u00a0Yeah. \nIf that\u2019s what you mean, then yeah, I work with kids \u2018like you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd\nyou help them liked you helped me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nsure,\u201d she said, putting her cup down for fear her shaking would show, \u201cwhen I\ncan.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndo you know what to say?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t. \u00a0Not really. \u00a0You go through a lot of training. \u00a0But sometimes that doesn\u2019t work. \u00a0So then you just have to be good at reading\npeople and improv from there.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou good at reading people?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nlike to think so. \u00a0I\u2019m good at listening,\nand that\u2019s part, most, of it,\u201d Charlie said, meeting Yoongi\u2019s stare. \u00a0Neither of their eyes faltered beyond blinks.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHave\nyou ever not saved someone?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCharlie said casually, \u201cof course.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t\nsave \u2018em all, huh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\nhappened?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwasn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nenough training, huh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nCharlie said, \u201cplenty of training. \u00a0Not\nenough experience.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWho\nwas it?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl?\u201d Yoongi said, and he watched as Charlie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u00a0She may have training in reading people, but\nso did he. \u00a0His years on the streets had\ntaught him plenty of ways to catch a liar.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl,\u201d Charlie repeated.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you just tell me? \u00a0I mean, we\u2019ve\ncome this far.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThis\nfar?\u201d </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFor\nfuck\u2019s sake, Charlie, you almost saw me kill myself. \u00a0And, arguably, you saved me. \u00a0I probably wouldn\u2019t be here if you hadn\u2019t\nstopped me. \u00a0I don\u2019t know about you, and\nI admit this is hard to admit, but, God, I feel like that connected us\nsomehow. \u00a0Maybe that\u2019s stupid, but.\u201d \u00a0Charlie sighed and looked at the hallway,\nwondering if his room was around the corner, wondering what was hiding in his\ncloset.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019d\nbetter go,\u201d she said, standing up. \u00a0Yoongi\nwatched her but didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d\nYoongi barely muttered under his breath. </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cLook,\nI hate Thanksgiving, you know? \u00a0It makes\nme feel insanely sentimental. \u00a0My\nfeelings are all fucked up. \u00a0And seeing\nyou didn\u2019t help. \u00a0I just mean,\u201d she said,\nholding her hands out of front of her and trying to wipe out everything she\njust said, \u201cI agree with you. \u00a0I haven\u2019t\nstopped thinking about you since you got down off that wall, okay? \u00a0I know we\u2019re connected, but I don\u2019t really\nknow what that means, and I\u2019d rather figure that out before I resort to getting\nswept up in some emotional wave. \u00a0And I\nknow that makes me sound like a complete ass,\u201d she said, and was relieved to\nreceive a smile, \u201cbut it\u2019s instinct to push back against connections for me\nwhile simultaneously wanting them. \nThat\u2019s what my training\u2019s been in, or something.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nYoongi said, walking her to the door. \n\u201cJust remember I may not feel you push, but I do have feelings.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nCharlie said, turning back around outside to look at Yoongi. \u00a0He didn\u2019t look like a Yoongi; not round or\nsmooth at all; leaner and more scarred than he should be, than anyone should\nbe.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nhey, I\u2019m only joking,\u201d he said, grinning an irresistible grin that quickly\ndissolved when Charlie actually pushed him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d\nshe said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhoa,\nshit, I didn\u2019t mean actually push me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nsay that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat? \u00a0Gah,\u201d Yoongi said as she pushed him lighter\nthis time.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nsay you\u2019re kidding if you\u2019re not. \u00a0That\u2019s\nthe kind of talk that will make people stop paying attention to you. \u00a0Don\u2019t cry wolf.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nalright,\u201d he said, \u201cstop pushing me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nyou feel that?\u201d Charlie said, her hand still on Yoongi\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno,\u201d he said, picking her hand off of his chest.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\nwas my sister,\u201d Charlie said, and Yoongi held onto her. \u00a0\u201cWhen I was fourteen. \u00a0She\u2019d been depressed for years, but my\nparents didn\u2019t take her seriously. \u00a0She\nlooked fine. \u00a0And then one day on our way\nhome from school she jumped in front of the train.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nYoongi said, loosening his grip on her hand. \n\u201cIn front of you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight\nin front of me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Yoongi muttered, and\nthen lamely her hand dropped from his. \nBut before she could stick them back in her coat pockets, he wrapped his\narms around her. \u00a0They felt like limp\nnoodles, and he knew he had found his hands behind her, and he knew his face\nwas pressed gently against her hair, but he felt so little, and he was afraid\nshe would feel less. \u00a0But he was warmer\nthan she expected, and her shoulders slackened, and she rested her forehead on\nhis shoulder and took a deep breath. \u00a0But\nhe smelled so much like smoke. \u00a0She\npushed him gently away, coughing.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\nsorry,\u201d Yoongi said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay,\u201d Charlie said in-between coughs. \n\u201cMy body just really hates smoke.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncan\u2019t

and his shirt and slipped into bed, waiting to slip into sleep.</p><hr><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nalways slept with her phone beside her and her notifications on. \u00a0Not because anyone ever called\u2014besides a few\ncases of drunk friends desperate for a ride in college\u2014but because she had\npromised every friend she would always be available. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t an empty promise; she meant what she\nsaid and said what she meant. \u00a0But\nhaven\u2019t not met anyone like her, most people did not take her seriously. \u00a0So when her phone buzzed, she immediately\nwoke up, her heart racing and adrenaline pumping, ready to deal with an\nemergency. \u00a0The phone light temporarily\nblinded her, but then she read the time and the text:</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nUnknown\nnumber: You up? (2:42AM)</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe had received\nplenty of random calls and texts; it was part of having a phone these\ndays. \u00a0And she had received plenty of\nprank calls and texts; it was part of giving your phone number away to\nteenagers. \u00a0And she had received plenty\nof \u201cbooty calls\u201d and unsolicited inappropriate pictures; it was part of being a\nwoman. \u00a0But her sense that someone could\nbe in danger was too strong, so she had to reply.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charlie: Who is this?

(2:54AM)</p><p>Charlie got out of\nbed, shuffling down the hall and to the front door. \u00a0She flicked on the outside light and undid\nthe latch. \u00a0Then she leaned against the\ncounter and closed her eyes. \u00a0Her phone\nbuzzed again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yoongi: Ok (2:58AM)</p><p>Charlie opened the\ndoor, and there he was, minus his shoes and shirt again, but this seemed to be\nhow she recognized him best. \u00a0She\nmotioned for him to come in and then shut and locked the door behind him. \u00a0She shuffled back down the hall, but at the\ndoorway turned around as he stood in the kitchen.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on,\u201d she whispered, her eyes\nhalf open. \u00a0He followed but found himself\nsuddenly in an odd position. \u00a0He had not\nexpected her to be up. \u00a0Or to\nrespond. \u00a0Or to invite him over. \u00a0Or to care. \nHe stood again at her bedroom door and watched her get back into bed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, a little\nexasperated, patting the bed beside her. \nBut he lingered for a moment, the glow of her lamp revealing a patchwork\nquilt of various flowers. \u00a0Two plants sat\nin her window sill, and a picture he couldn\u2019t make out sat on her dresser. \u00a0She had already slid down under the covers\nand was reaching to turn out the light, so he hurried\u2014while still tiptoeing\nlike an idiot\u2014to climb into bed beside her. \nHe could tell it was warmer, and the smell of lavender seemed to\nsurround him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTwo rules,\u201d he heard Charlie\nwhisper, and he lay on his side to look at her in the dark. \u00a0\u201cNo touching, and no getting upset if I fall\nasleep.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said, feeling like\nhe was at a sleepover at the cool kid\u2019s house. \nNow that he was here, he was afraid to say or do anything for fear of\nbeing kicked out. \u00a0So he didn\u2019t, and\nCharlie didn\u2019t seem to care, as she was soon asleep. \u00a0</p></p>",

what was\nmissing. \u00a0It was also one of the few days\nthroughout the year that she didn\u2019t work, but she found herself unable to stay\ninside for long. \u00a0In the afternoon, after\na turkey sandwich, she bundled herself up and headed to a park. \u00a0One glimpse told her that Yoongi was still\ngone. \u00a0She had been fearing the worse for\nhim, that his brains were splattered in a pattern above his bed, or an array of\npills were scattered around his body, or one stray match would explode the gas\nhe had slowly leaked out to engulf him. \nThe way he smoked, the last option might have been his way to go. \u00a0Any day now the smell would finally penetrate\nthe door that she stopped by every morning and she would finally know that she\nwas right, that she hadn\u2019t helped at all, and that her neighbor\u2014Yoongi\u2014was\ndead. \u00a0She regretted now not taking his\nnumber as well; she knew no one who knew him, and she wasn\u2019t going to call the\npolice.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWithout\nphysical proof, they could have no cause for forced entry.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nshe had found herself checking the obituaries and missing person reports\nanyway. \u00a0She did every day for work,\nanyway, to check up on old cases and be on the lookout for any new ones.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nwasn\u2019t really sure what she wanted to find, or what she expected.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nwhen the sun was setting, she returned from her walk, and there he was,\noutside, smoking, and she was sure he saw her as she saw him, but, not wanting\nto break the spell, she said and did nothing except ascend the steps until she\nwas in front of her door. \u00a0From there she\ncould tell he really was back; his hair had aged three weeks, and had suddenly\nbeen bleached blonde, and he was fully dressed, but apart from that, his\nfingers went to his mouth and out in the same habitual manner.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWelcome\nback,\u201d she said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNice\nflannel.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d \u00a0She didn\u2019t know what she had expected, but it\nwasn\u2019t as painful as she thought it would be. \nHe was far from forthcoming, but his eyes were responsive, and she could\ntell something had changed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\ndid you actually get cold, or?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNah,\nI just tend to get dressed when I go out.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAh,\nright, for the best,\u201d Charlie said. \n\u201cFamily?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHell\nno,\u201d he said, a puff of smoke releasing them from him. \u201cJust got back.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cwhere were you?\u201d \u00a0She was\ncloser to him now, and while the smoke repelled her, something in him had\nsoftened and was even inviting. \u00a0That was\na possibility. \u00a0Or Charlie was just dying\nfor anyone to be close to on this accursed holiday. \u00a0There was a power in shared loneliness. \u00a0She had learned that too late in some cases.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nwhen I told my sponsor what happened he insisted I check myself in. \u00a0So I was on a 72-hour suicide watch that\nturned into three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d\nCharlie said, but her breath disappeared as he rolled up his flannel sleeves to\nshow her all of his freshly made scars. \nThe knowledge that he may not even feel her empowered her to softly run\nher fingers along them. \u00a0\u201cI was really\nworried about you.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\nhe said, his fingers faltering. \u00a0He took\na step away from her and stepped out his cigarette. \u00a0\u201cYou wanna come in for a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nopened the door, and for want of company or pure curiosity, Charlie followed\nhim in.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHelplessness\nwas not going to beat him. \u00a0He had beaten\nthese thoughts and feelings before, so this time shouldn\u2019t be any harder.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nit was. \u00a0Because every day was getting\nharder, because every day was added to the next. \u00a0He\u2019d just lost it for a bit, for a few\ndays. \u00a0That\u2019s what he always allowed\nhimself to believe. \u00a0And the meds would\nwork better this time. \u00a0He already felt\nbetter. \u00a0Woozier, sure, and more\ndulled. \u00a0He had seen Charlie touch his\narm, but he had felt nothing.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ncould feel the smoke against his throat, though, and he could feel the steaming\ntea on his tongue. \u00a0And he could see\nCharlie eyeing his apartment. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t\nas clean as hers; he had more junk sitting around taking up room, but he had\ncleaned it when he had come home earlier that day. \u00a0A musty smell remained, but he could open\nwindows when she left.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nhad taken off her coat, and he could see her collarbone above her sweater, and\nhe followed her eyes around his apartment.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nmessy, sorry,\u201d he said, suddenly, surprisingly, embarrassed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\njust got back,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m just admiring your posters.\u201d \u00a0Stylish <i>The</i>\n<i>Black Knight Rises, Scott Pilgrim, Harry\nPotter, Kingsmen, Fargo, </i>and <i>Mad Max </i>posters\nlined his walls, some peeling and tearing in the corners. \u00a0They had been up for three years, and he\nthought nothing of them now.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMmm. \u00a0So you\u2019re a social worker?\u201d he said, and\nCharlie struggled to remember for a second giving him her card, but she also supposed\nhe could have found that information out easily.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAny\ngood?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDepends\non what you mean by good,\u201d she said, faltering again. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t a question she had been asked\nbefore.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou help kids?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. \u00a0Those that I can.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWork\nwith any kids like me?\u201d he said, nonchalantly sipping his tea. \u00a0She, of course, didn\u2019t know what he\nmeant. \u00a0Suicidal? \u00a0Smoker? \nSeemingly without a family or job? \nOf course. \u00a0But an obvious\nquestion wasn\u2019t always so obvious.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\ndo you mean \u2018like

\nAnd suddenly Charlie was angry.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSuicidal? \u00a0Yeah. \nIf that\u2019s what you mean, then yeah, I work with kids \u2018like

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t. \u00a0Not really. \u00a0You go through a lot of training. \u00a0But sometimes that doesn\u2019t work. \u00a0So then you just have to be good at reading\npeople and improv from there.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou good at reading people?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nlike to think so. \u00a0I\u2019m good at listening,\nand that\u2019s part, most, of it,\u201d Charlie said, meeting Yoongi\u2019s stare. \u00a0Neither of their eyes faltered beyond blinks.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHave\nyou ever not saved someone?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nCharlie said casually,

experience.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWho\nwas it?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl?\u201d Yoongi said, and he watched as Charlie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u00a0She may have training in reading people, but\nso did he. \u00a0His years on the streets had\ntaught him plenty of ways to catch a liar.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust\nsome girl,\u201d Charlie repeated.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\ndon\u2019t you just tell me? \u00a0I mean, we\u2019ve\ncome this far.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThis\nfar?\u201d </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFor\nfuck\u2019s sake, Charlie, you almost saw me kill myself. \u00a0And, arguably, you saved me. \u00a0I probably wouldn\u2019t be here if you hadn\u2019t\nstopped me. \u00a0I don\u2019t know about you, and\nI admit this is hard to admit, but, God, I feel like that connected us\nsomehow. \u00a0Maybe that\u2019s stupid, but.\u201d \u00a0Charlie sighed and looked at the hallway,\nwondering if his room was around the corner, wondering what was hiding in his\ncloset.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019d\nbetter go,\u201d she said, standing up. \u00a0Yoongi\nwatched her but didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d\nYoongi barely muttered under his breath. </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cLook,\nI hate Thanksgiving, you know? \u00a0It makes\nme feel insanely sentimental. \u00a0My\nfeelings are all fucked up. \u00a0And seeing\nyou didn\u2019t help. \u00a0I just mean,\u201d she said,\nholding her hands out of front of her and trying to wipe out everything she\njust said, \u201cI agree with you. \u00a0I haven\u2019t\nstopped thinking about you since you got down off that wall, okay? \u00a0I know we\u2019re connected, but I don\u2019t really\nknow what that means, and I\u2019d rather figure that out before I resort to getting\nswept up in some emotional wave. \u00a0And I\nknow that makes me sound like a complete ass,\u201d she said, and was relieved to\nreceive a smile, \u201cbut it\u2019s instinct to push back against connections for me\nwhile simultaneously wanting them. \nThat\u2019s what my training\u2019s been in, or something.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d\nYoongi said, walking her to the door. \n\u201cJust remember I may not feel you push, but I do have feelings.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nCharlie said, turning back around outside to look at Yoongi. \u00a0He didn\u2019t look like a Yoongi; not round or\nsmooth at all; leaner and more scarred than he should be, than anyone should\nbe.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nhey, I\u2019m only joking,\u201d he said, grinning an irresistible grin that quickly\ndissolved when Charlie actually pushed him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d\nshe said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhoa,\nshit, I didn\u2019t mean actually push me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nsay that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat? \u00a0Gah,\u201d Yoongi said as she pushed him lighter\nthis time.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nsay you\u2019re kidding if you\u2019re not. \u00a0That\u2019s\nthe kind of talk that will make people stop paying attention to you. \u00a0Don\u2019t cry wolf.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nalright,\u201d he said, \u201cstop pushing me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nyou feel that?\u201d Charlie said, her hand still on Yoongi\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno,\u201d he said, picking her hand off of his chest.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\nwas my sister,\u201d Charlie said, and Yoongi held onto her. \u00a0\u201cWhen I was fourteen. \u00a0She\u2019d been depressed for years, but my\nparents didn\u2019t take her seriously. \u00a0She\nlooked fine. \u00a0And then one day on our way\nhome from school she jumped in front of the train.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nYoongi said, loosening his grip on her hand. \n\u201cIn front of you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight\nin front of me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Yoongi muttered, and\nthen lamely her hand dropped from his. \nBut before she could stick them back in her coat pockets, he wrapped his\narms around her. \u00a0They felt like limp\nnoodles, and he knew he had found his hands behind her, and he knew his face\nwas pressed gently against her hair, but he felt so little, and he was afraid\nshe would feel less. \u00a0But he was warmer\nthan she expected, and her shoulders slackened, and she rested her forehead on\nhis shoulder and took a deep breath. \u00a0But\nhe smelled so much like smoke. \u00a0She\npushed him gently away, coughing.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\nsorry,\u201d Yoongi said.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay,\u201d Charlie said in-between coughs. \n\u201cMy body just really hates smoke.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncan\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThanks\nfor the tea,\u201d Charlie said before slipping away. \u00a0And as soon as his door was shut, he slipped\noff his shoes and his shirt and slipped into bed, waiting to slip into sleep.</p><hr><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe\nalways slept with her phone beside her and her notifications on. \u00a0Not because anyone ever called\u2014besides a few\ncases of drunk friends desperate for a ride in college\u2014but because she had\npromised every friend she would always be available. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t an empty promise; she meant what she\nsaid and said what she meant. \u00a0But\nhaven\u2019t not met anyone like her, most people did not take her seriously. \u00a0So when her phone buzzed, she immediately\nwoke up, her heart racing and adrenaline pumping, ready to deal with an\nemergency. \u00a0The phone light temporarily\nblinded her, but then she read the time and the text:</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nUnknown\nnumber: You up? (2:42AM)</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nShe had received\nplenty of random calls and texts; it was part of having a phone these\ndays. \u00a0And she had received plenty of\nprank calls and texts; it was part of giving your phone number away to\nteenagers. \u00a0And she had received plenty\nof \u201cbooty calls\u201d and unsolicited inappropriate pictures; it was part of being a\nwoman. \u00a0But her sense that someone could\nbe in danger was too strong, so she had to reply.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charlie: Who is this?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nShe\nwasn&rsquo;t really sure what she wanted to find, or what she expected.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nBut\nwhen the sun was setting, she returned from her walk, and there he was,\noutside, smoking, and she was sure he saw her as she saw him, but, not wanting\nto break the spell, she said and did nothing except ascend the steps until she\nwas in front of her door. &nbsp;From there she\ncould tell he really was back; his hair had aged three weeks, and had suddenly\nbeen bleached blonde, and he was fully dressed, but apart from that, his\nfingers went to his mouth and out in the same habitual manner.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Welcome\nback,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Nice\nflannel.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t know what she had expected, but it\nwasn&rsquo;t as painful as she thought it would be. \nHe was far from forthcoming, but his eyes were responsive, and she could\ntell something had changed.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;So\ndid you actually get cold, or?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Nah,\nI just tend to get dressed when I go out.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Ah,\nright, for the best,&rdquo; Charlie said. \n&ldquo;Family?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hell\nno,&rdquo; he said, a puff of smoke releasing them from him. &ldquo;Just got back.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nshe said, &ldquo;where were you?&rdquo; &nbsp;She was\ncloser to him now, and while the smoke repelled her, something in him had\nsoftened and was even inviting. &nbsp;That was\na possibility. &nbsp;Or Charlie was just dying\nfor anyone to be close to on this accursed holiday. &nbsp;There was a power in shared loneliness. &nbsp;She had learned that too late in some cases.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Well,\nwhen I told my sponsor what happened he insisted I check myself in. &nbsp;So I was on a 72-hour suicide watch that\nturned into three weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo;\nCharlie said, but her breath disappeared as he rolled up his flannel sleeves to\nshow her all of his freshly made scars. \nThe knowledge that he may not even feel her empowered her to softly run\nher fingers along them. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was really\nworried about you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;\nhe said, his fingers faltering. &nbsp;He took\na step away from her and stepped out his cigarette. &nbsp;&ldquo;You wanna come in for a cup of tea?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\nopened the door, and for want of company or pure curiosity, Charlie followed\nhim in.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHelplessness\nwas not going to beat him. &nbsp;He had beaten\nthese thoughts and feelings before, so this time shouldn&rsquo;t be any harder.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nBut\nit was. &nbsp;Because every day was getting\nharder, because every day was added to the next. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d just lost it for a bit, for a few\ndays. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what he always allowed\nhimself to believe. &nbsp;And the meds would\nwork better this time. &nbsp;He already felt\nbetter. &nbsp;Woozier, sure, and more\ndulled. &nbsp;He had seen Charlie touch his\narm, but he had felt nothing.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\ncould feel the smoke against his throat, though, and he could feel the steaming\ntea on his tongue. &nbsp;And he could see\nCharlie eyeing his apartment. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t\nas clean as hers; he had more junk sitting around taking up room, but he had\ncleaned it when he had come home earlier that day. &nbsp;A musty smell remained, but he could open\nwindows when she left.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nShe\nhad taken off her coat, and he could see her collarbone above her sweater, and\nhe followed her eyes around his apartment.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nmessy, sorry,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, surprisingly, embarrassed.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\njust got back,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just admiring your posters.&rdquo; &nbsp;Stylish <i>The</i>\n<i>Black Knight Rises, Scott Pilgrim, Harry\nPotter, Kingsmen, Fargo, </i>and <i>Mad Max </i>posters\nlined his walls, some peeling and tearing in the corners. &nbsp;They had been up for three years, and he\nthought nothing of them now.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Mmm. &nbsp;So you&rsquo;re a social worker?&rdquo; he said, and\nCharlie struggled to remember for a second giving him her card, but she also supposed\nhe could have found that information out easily.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Any\ngood?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Depends\non what you mean by good,&rdquo; she said, faltering again. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t a question she had been asked\nbefore.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou help kids?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Those that I can.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What\ndo you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Sometimes\nthey don&rsquo;t want help. &nbsp;Sometimes\npaperwork gets in the way. &nbsp;Sometimes\nthere doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a solution.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Work\nwith any kids like me?&rdquo; he said, nonchalantly sipping his tea. &nbsp;She, of course, didn&rsquo;t know what he\nmeant. &nbsp;Suicidal? &nbsp;Smoker? \nSeemingly without a family or job? \nOf course. &nbsp;But an obvious\nquestion wasn&rsquo;t always so obvious.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What\ndo you mean &lsquo;like you&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nknow,&rdquo; he said, suddenly pulling down his sleeve again and running his fingers\nalong his arm, the bumps in the road. \nAnd suddenly Charlie was angry.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Suicidal? &nbsp;Yeah. \nIf that&rsquo;s what you mean, then yeah, I work with kids &lsquo;like you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;And\nyou help them liked you helped me?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nsure,&rdquo; she said, putting her cup down for fear her shaking would show, &ldquo;when I\ncan.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;How\ndo you know what to say?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;You go through a lot of training. &nbsp;But sometimes that doesn&rsquo;t work. &nbsp;So then you just have to be good at reading\npeople and improv from there.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Are\nyou good at reading people?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nlike to think so. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m good at listening,\nand that&rsquo;s part, most, of it,&rdquo; Charlie said, meeting Yoongi&rsquo;s stare. &nbsp;Neither of their eyes faltered beyond blinks.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Have\nyou ever not saved someone?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nCharlie said casually, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t\nsave &lsquo;em all, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What\nhappened?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nwasn&rsquo;t ready.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Not\nenough training, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nCharlie said, &ldquo;plenty of training. &nbsp;Not\nenough experience.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Who\nwas it?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Just\nsome girl.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Just\nsome girl?&rdquo; Yoongi said, and he watched as Charlie&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &nbsp;She may have training in reading people, but\nso did he. &nbsp;His years on the streets had\ntaught him plenty of ways to catch a liar.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Just\nsome girl,&rdquo; Charlie repeated.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Why\ndon&rsquo;t you just tell me? &nbsp;I mean, we&rsquo;ve\ncome this far.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;This\nfar?&rdquo; </p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;For\nfuck&rsquo;s sake, Charlie, you almost saw me kill myself. &nbsp;And, arguably, you saved me. &nbsp;I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be here if you hadn&rsquo;t\nstopped me. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know about you, and\nI admit this is hard to admit, but, God, I feel like that connected us\nsomehow. &nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s stupid, but.&rdquo; &nbsp;Charlie sighed and looked at the hallway,\nwondering if his room was around the corner, wondering what was hiding in his\ncloset.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d\nbetter go,&rdquo; she said, standing up. &nbsp;Yoongi\nwatched her but didn&rsquo;t move.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo;\nYoongi barely muttered under his breath. </p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Look,\nI hate Thanksgiving, you know? &nbsp;It makes\nme feel insanely sentimental. &nbsp;My\nfeelings are all fucked up. &nbsp;And seeing\nyou didn&rsquo;t help. &nbsp;I just mean,&rdquo; she said,\nholding her hands out of front of her and trying to wipe out everything she\njust said, &ldquo;I agree with you. &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t\nstopped thinking about you since you got down off that wall, okay? &nbsp;I know we&rsquo;re connected, but I don&rsquo;t really\nknow what that means, and I&rsquo;d rather figure that out before I resort to getting\nswept up in some emotional wave. &nbsp;And I\nknow that makes me sound like a complete ass,&rdquo; she said, and was relieved to\nreceive a smile, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s instinct to push back against connections for me\nwhile simultaneously wanting them. \nThat&rsquo;s what my training&rsquo;s been in, or something.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nYoongi said, walking her to the door. \n&ldquo;Just remember I may not feel you push, but I do have feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo;\nCharlie said, turning back around outside to look at Yoongi. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t look like a Yoongi; not round or\nsmooth at all; leaner and more scarred than he should be, than anyone should\nbe.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nhey, I&rsquo;m only joking,&rdquo; he said, grinning an irresistible grin that quickly\ndissolved when Charlie actually pushed him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;\nshe said.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Whoa,\nshit, I didn&rsquo;t mean actually push me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nsay that.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What? &nbsp;Gah,&rdquo; Yoongi said as she pushed him lighter\nthis time.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nsay you&rsquo;re kidding if you&rsquo;re not. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s\nthe kind of talk that will make people stop paying attention to you. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t cry wolf.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nalright,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;stop pushing me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Can\nyou feel that?&rdquo; Charlie said, her hand still on Yoongi&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nno,&rdquo; he said, picking her hand off of his chest.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It\nwas my sister,&rdquo; Charlie said, and Yoongi held onto her. &nbsp;&ldquo;When I was fourteen. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d been depressed for years, but my\nparents didn&rsquo;t take her seriously. &nbsp;She\nlooked fine. &nbsp;And then one day on our way\nhome from school she jumped in front of the train.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo;\nYoongi said, loosening his grip on her hand. \n&ldquo;In front of you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Right\nin front of me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; Yoongi muttered, and\nthen lamely her hand dropped from his. \nBut before she could stick them back in her coat pockets, he wrapped his\narms around her. &nbsp;They felt like limp\nnoodles, and he knew he had found his hands behind her, and he knew his face\nwas pressed gently against her hair, but he felt so little, and he was afraid\nshe would feel less. &nbsp;But he was warmer\nthan she expected, and her shoulders slackened, and she rested her forehead on\nhis shoulder and took a deep breath. &nbsp;But\nhe smelled so much like smoke. &nbsp;She\npushed him gently away, coughing.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Shit,\nsorry,&rdquo; Yoongi said.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nokay,&rdquo; Charlie said in-between coughs. \n&ldquo;My body just really hates smoke.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Thanks\nfor the tea,&rdquo; Charlie said before slipping away. &nbsp;And as soon as his door was shut, he slipped\noff his shoes and his shirt and slipped into bed, waiting to slip into sleep.</p><hr /><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nShe\nalways slept with her phone beside her and her notifications on. &nbsp;Not because anyone ever called&mdash;besides a few\ncases of drunk friends desperate for a ride in college&mdash;but because she had\npromised every friend she would always be available. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t an empty promise; she meant what she\nsaid and said what she meant. &nbsp;But\nhaven&rsquo;t not met anyone like her, most people did not take her seriously. &nbsp;So when her phone buzzed, she immediately\nwoke up, her heart racing and adrenaline pumping, ready to deal with an\nemergency. &nbsp;The phone light temporarily\nblinded her, but then she read the time and the text:</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nUnknown\nnumber: You up? (2:42AM)</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nShe had received\nplenty of random calls and texts; it was part of having a phone these\ndays. &nbsp;And she had received plenty of\nprank calls and texts; it was part of giving your phone number away to\nteenagers. &nbsp;And she had received plenty\nof &ldquo;booty calls&rdquo; and unsolicited inappropriate pictures; it was part of being a\nwoman. &nbsp;But her sense that someone could\nbe in danger was too strong, so she had to reply.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Who is this? (2:44AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&hellip;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown number: Ouch. &nbsp;Yoongi (2:45AM)</p><p>Charlie sat up in\nbed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Oh shit, sorry, didn&rsquo;t have\nyour number (2:45AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Ah yeah (2:45AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: So I guess you&rsquo;re up.\n(2:46AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Am now (2:46AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Did I wake you up?? (2:46AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Yeah (2:47AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Shit, sorry, go back to\nsleep. (2:47AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: What&rsquo;s up? (2:47AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Nah, nothing (2:47AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Right. &nbsp;Why you still awake? (2:48AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Can&rsquo;t sleep (2:49AM)</p><p>Charlie turned on\nher lamp. &nbsp;Ever additional beam of\nlight made her want to close her eyes more.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: You okay? (2:49AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Yeah (2:50AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Convincing (2:50AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Ha (2:50AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Want to come talk about it?\n(2:52AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Nah, no worries (2:52AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie: Don&rsquo;t make me come push you\n(2:52AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Ha. Don&rsquo;t you have work in\nthe morning? (2:53AM)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie, just come over. I&rsquo;ll unlock\nthe door. (2:54AM)</p><p>Charlie got out of\nbed, shuffling down the hall and to the front door. &nbsp;She flicked on the outside light and undid\nthe latch. &nbsp;Then she leaned against the\ncounter and closed her eyes. &nbsp;Her phone\nbuzzed again.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yoongi: Ok (2:58AM)</p><p>Charlie opened the\ndoor, and there he was, minus his shoes and shirt again, but this seemed to be\nhow she recognized him best. &nbsp;She\nmotioned for him to come in and then shut and locked the door behind him. &nbsp;She shuffled back down the hall, but at the\ndoorway turned around as he stood in the kitchen.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she whispered, her eyes\nhalf open. &nbsp;He followed but found himself\nsuddenly in an odd position. &nbsp;He had not\nexpected her to be up. &nbsp;Or to\nrespond. &nbsp;Or to invite him over. &nbsp;Or to care. \nHe stood again at her bedroom door and watched her get back into bed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she said, a little\nexasperated, patting the bed beside her. \nBut he lingered for a moment, the glow of her lamp revealing a patchwork\nquilt of various flowers. &nbsp;Two plants sat\nin her window sill, and a picture he couldn&rsquo;t make out sat on her dresser. &nbsp;She had already slid down under the covers\nand was reaching to turn out the light, so he hurried&mdash;while still tiptoeing\nlike an idiot&mdash;to climb into bed beside her. \nHe could tell it was warmer, and the smell of lavender seemed to\nsurround him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Two rules,&rdquo; he heard Charlie\nwhisper, and he lay on his side to look at her in the dark. &nbsp;&ldquo;No touching, and no getting upset if I fall\nasleep.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; he said, feeling like\nhe was at a sleepover at the cool kid&rsquo;s house. \nNow that he was here, he was afraid to say or do anything for fear of\nbeing kicked out. &nbsp;So he didn&rsquo;t, and\nCharlie didn&rsquo;t seem to care, as she was soon asleep. &nbsp;</p></p>",
