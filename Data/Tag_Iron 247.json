He didn\u2019t think about that. Could two year olds use the bathroom by themselves or did they need help? And If Peter needed help, he desperately hoped the kid wouldn\u2019t remember it when he was changed back.<b><br/></b></p><p>He walked to the bathroom with Peter following suit.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d </p><p>Peter gave a shy nod.</p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s give this a go then, I guess.\u201d Tony took a deep breath.</p><p>He pulled down the boy\u2019s pants and lifted him so that he was sat on the toilet, but kept a firm grip on his underarms.</p><p>Peter kept his hands attached to Tony\u2019s arms, and the seconds passed by agonizingly slow before Peter shouted, \u201cAll done!\u201d</p><p>After getting his hands washed, Tony brought Peter back out to the living room where he remembered why they had even been out there in the first place.</p><p>\u201cOh shi-shoot, you need food,\u201d </p><p>\u201cHungwy!\u201d</p><p>Tony lifted Peter and headed to the kitchen, where he searched again for food, finding a box of mac and cheese, \u201cCan two year olds have this?\u201d He spoke to himself. He looked at Peter who was now chewing on his shirt, \u201cYeah I think this\u2019ll work for now.\u201d</p><p>He got to work making the kid\u2019s lunch, but it proved to be a difficult task with only one available arm. </p><p>Pepper strode back into the room, much to Tony\u2019s relief. </p><p>\u201cBabe, can you watch Pete while I make this?\u201d He called over his shoulder, attempting to stir the noodles while keeping a grabby Peter away from the oven. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Pepper apologized as she strode over to the pair, \u201cI\u2019m going to be late for a meeting if I don\u2019t leave now,\u201d She kissed her husband\u2019s cheek, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have one of the others come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll never hear the end of it,\u201d Tony grumbled and Pepper chuckled. </p><p>\u201cSorry honey, I\u2019ll be back later this evening and I\u2019ll help you then.\u201d She reassured him and placed a quick kiss on Peter\u2019s forehead, making him giggle, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to me or him?\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>Pepper smirked, \u201cBoth of you. And I\u2019m talking to both of you when I say to <i>behave</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright alright, go before you\u2019re late.\u201d Tony told her, and she gave him one more kiss before heading out. </p><p>Sighing, Tony called to his AI, \u201cFRI, can you see if Steve\u2019s busy?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHe is currently reading on the common floor.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cGreat, tell him I need him to come up here,\u201d He glanced at Peter, \u201cAlso, go ahead and order anything a two year old might need. Food, clothes, toys, whatever. And a bed. I don\u2019t know how long this arrangement is going to be.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWill do, boss.\u201d</i></p><p>A minute passed before she spoke again, <i>\u201cMost everything will be delivered by this evening. There are a few things that will be here in the morning.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Tony. What did you-\u201c Steve stopped in his tracks to see Tony turning towards him, stirring spoon in one hand and a baby in the other, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please watch him for a few minutes? I need to finish making his lunch and he\u2019s making that damn near impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, who is this exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201c</p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow, \u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d</p><p>Tony let out an exaggerated sigh, \u201cIt was one of Loki\u2019s tricks,\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Steve walked into the kitchen, holding his hands out towards Peter, \u201cHey little guy, why don\u2019t you come with me for a little bit?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared back at him, his hands fisted in Tony\u2019s shirt, then turned to look at Tony. </p><p>Tony only smiled down at him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay buddy. I need to finish making your lunch. I just need you to go with Steve for a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Peter turned back to the captain, his eyes suspiciously wet but reached out nonetheless.</p><p>Steve smiled and pulled the small bundle into his arms, heading over to the living room.</p><p>Tony watched as Steve set Peter on his lap and cooed at him, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of sadness at the idea of Peter going back to 16. He knew he wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s father, but he still felt upset at the fact that he never got to see Peter grow up.</p><p>Shoving his feelings down, Tony turned back to his task and finished making the mac and cheese.</p><p>He had just finished, putting some into a small bowl when he heard a glass shattering squeal and Steve screaming, \u201cPeter, get down from there!\u201d</p><p>Tony turned to see Steve staring up at the ceiling, his arms extended. Slowly, he raised his head, only to see Peter crawling on the MOTHER FUCKING CEILING.</p><p>That shit was unnerving when Peter did it as a <i>teenager</i>, but it was gut wrenchingly terrifying to see him do it as a <i>baby</i>.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Tony screamed, dropping the fork he had in his hand and running into the living room, \u201cHow the hell did he get up there?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must still have his powers-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, dipshit! I mean how did he get up there while you were watching him??\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s face fell and he looked guilty, \u201cHe was on the floor playing with the coaster I gave him as a distraction. I went to text Nat back and when I looked back up, he was up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogers, I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Pider!\u201d Peter screamed.</p><p>Tony turned his attention to the child hanging above him, \u201cYes Pete, you\u2019re a spider. Now will you please come down?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head and screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d and crawled away, Tony and Steve chasing after him.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Tony cursed under his breath, \u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? I have food ready.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of food Peter turned his little body, looking at Tony, \u201cOtay,\u201d He crawled back to the men and looked down at them.</p><p>The next moment Tony would never be able to unsee for the rest of his life.</p><p>Peter unhooked from the ceiling, free falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d The two men screamed.</p><p>Steve caught Peter in his arms, and Tony clutched at his chest, desperately trying to slow his breathing.</p><p>\u201cChrist Peter! You\u2019re gonna give me a f-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve chided.</p><p>\u201cFreaking heart attack.\u201d Tony corrected himself.</p><p>He took Peter from Steve and carried him over to the kitchen. He grabbed the bowl and set it on the table, setting Peter in his lap. Peter took the fork and began feeding himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that,\u201d Steve apologized.</p><p>Tony rubbed one of his temples, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. You caught him, so let\u2019s just call it even, yeah?\u201d Tony spoke, but his eyes never left Peter. He ran his hands through the boy\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d Steve added, before walking back to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI might actually need you and the others to help bring stuff up here later on. I had to uh, order a bunch of baby stuff.\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled, \u201cAlright, just let us know.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>Tony continued to watch Peter eat, but was so lost in thought he didn\u2019t notice Peter totally disregard the fork and begin eating with his hands.</p><p>He only noticed when Peter grabbed the bowl and almost throw it.</p><p>\u201cPete! Geez kid,\u201d He grabbed the bowl and set it aside.</p><p>\u201cMo\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWan\u2019 mo\u2019!\u201d Peter replied, \u201cHungwy.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, but obliged, giving Peter another bowl of the food.</p><p>Once he was done, Tony threw everything in the sink, then took one look at Peter and realized how much of a mess the kid had made.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s bath time.\u201d He huffed. He took Peter to the bathroom and drew a small bath, checking several times to make sure the water wasn\u2019t too hot.</p><p>When the time came to get the boy\u2019s dirty clothes off, Tony stopped.</p><p>He looked at Peter, who was sitting on the toilet seat, swinging his little legs, staring at the water.</p><p>He sighed, \u201cOkay, Pete. I guess this isn\u2019t any worse than having to help you use the bathroom, huh?.\u201d</p><p>But Peter just looked at Tony with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cI really hope you don\u2019t remember any of this,\u201d Tony muttered as he stood the boy on the floor, shedding his dirty clothes. </p><p>He picked Peter up, and began to slowly lower him into the tub, but Peter screamed once his toes touched the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat?? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tony pulled him back, immediately checking to see if maybe the temperature of the water was too cold or too hot.</p><p>\u201cNo swim!\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at him, dumbfounded, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019 swim!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to swim, Petey. Just sit. I promise you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Peter gave Tony his signature puppy dog eyes, \u201cPwomise?\u201d</p><p>It was damn near a miracle Tony\u2019s heart didn\u2019t burst out of his chest right there.</p><p>\u201cI promise, bud.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at the water once more before nodding.</p><p>Tony again took Peter in his arms, and slowly lowered him into the water. Peter immediately sat in the shallow depth, using his hands to swish the water around.</p><p>While he was distracted, Tony grabbed a wash rag and submerged it, then put a small dollop of Pepper\u2019s body wash on it.</p><p>He figured her\u2019s would be more gentle on Peter\u2019s already sensitive skin.</p><p>He began to rub the child down, covering his body in foaming soap.</p><p>When he was finished, he grabbed the handheld shower head, and began to wash Peter\u2019s hair.</p><p>Peter leaned into Tony\u2019s touch, and Tony saw the boy\u2019s eyes beginning to flutter shut.</p><p>Figuring it was time for a nap, he quickly finished, draining the tub and wrapping Peter in the fluffiest towel he had.</p><p>When he got back into the bedroom, Tony realized he didn\u2019t have any clothes to fit Peter yet.</p><p>He decided to just use one of his shirts for the time being, so he grabbed an old Black Sabbath shirt from his drawer and pulled it over Peter\u2019s tiny body.</p><p>It was way too big on him, it looked like it was eating him whole. But it covered him and that was the point, right?</p><p>\u201cOkay, Petey, time for a nap.\u201d He gathered the boy in his arms and laid him in the middle of the bed. Deciding Peter couldn\u2019t get into any trouble while sleeping, he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Ony?\u201d Came Peter\u2019s sleepy voice.</p><p>Tony turned to see Peter sitting up from the bed, trying to rub the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo leave.\u201d Peter\u2019s lower lip trembled.</p><p>\u201cNo no, Petey. I\u2019m right here. No need to cry.\u201d Tony hurried back to Peter\u2019s side, grabbing his tiny hands.</p><p>\u201cNo leave.\u201d The boy repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Tony assured, climbing into bed next to him.</p><p>Peter crawled up onto Tony, resting his head on the man\u2019s chest.</p><p>Tony wrapped his arms protectively around him, and they both fell asleep like that.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>Tony grunted, but didn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTony. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>Opening his eyes, he saw Natasha standing at the end of his bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s stuff is here.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of the boy, Tony realized the warm weight on his chest was gone, and shot up from the bed, \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He was still sleeping when we came up here, but I guess he heard us and waddled out there.\u201d Natasha said, pointing to the door, \u201cLet me tell you, you and Wanda are gonna have to fight over him. She won\u2019t let him go.\u201d She smirked.</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, getting out of the bed.</p><p>He followed the assassin out to the living room to see the entire team vying for Peter\u2019s attention.</p><p>Who knew a baby would bring them together like this?</p><p>But of course it\u2019s baby Peter. And everyone already loved Peter.</p><p>Once Tony got into Peter\u2019s line of sight, however, the boy squealed and squirmed from Clint\u2019s grasp, \u201c\u2018Ony!\u201d</p><p>Clint let go, and Peter clumsily bounded towards Tony, who scooped him up, \u201cHey bud, you having fun?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, \u201cSpeve gimme i\u2019 cweam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeve gave you ice cream?\u201d Tony snickered.</p><p>Steve rolled his eyes and Bucky laughed, \u201cI gave him some ice cream, he said he was hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have given him something with less sugar?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cSpeve wanted Peter to like him best.\u201d Bucky said through barely controlled laughter.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019re just pouty because Peter can actually say <i>my </i>name.\u201d</p><p>Steve ignored him, \u201cTony, do you want the crib in your room?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, \u201cYeah, please.\u201d</p><p>The two super soldiers took the crib that they had put together (how long had Tony been sleeping?) in Tony\u2019s room.</p><p>They all helped him put the stuff away in an organized manner so that he could find what he needed easily.</p><p>Soon Pepper came back, and the team had decided to have a movie night in their suite.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t bother refuting the idea, he knew they just wanted to be near Peter.</p><p>They chose a movie that would be appropriate for a two year old to watch (they settled on Frozen, since half the team hadn\u2019t seen it yet).</p><p>By the time the movie ended, Peter had snuggled in between Pepper and Tony, gripping a stuffed giraffe that he had so accurately named \u2018puppy\u2019, that came with the several toys that were delivered earlier. He was sound asleep, head resting on Tony\u2019s arm.</p><p>The team quietly left the suite, leaving Peter, Tony, and Pepper alone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Pepper whispered, carding her fingers through the boy\u2019s brown curls.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony agreed, smiling.</p><p>He picked up the boy and carried him to the bedroom, setting him down in the crib. He was thankful they had decided to change him into his new pajamas earlier in the night.</p><p>After both Tony and Pepper changed into their own pajamas, they climbed into bed, Tony with his arms around her.</p><p>He was half asleep when he heard a sniffle and a small whimper. Turning his head, he saw Peter standing in the crib, peeking over the railing.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Peter.\u201d Tony whispered.</p><p>Peter only whimpered again, reaching a hand out to grab at Tony.</p><p>\u201cJust bring him to bed,\u201d Came Pepper\u2019s sleep laced voice.</p><p>Tony startled, not aware that she was awake.</p><p>He huffed, and threw the covers off, walking over to Peter.</p><p>Peter smiled a big toothy grin and reached up for Tony.</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Tony sighed.</p><p>He picked up the boy and brought him back to the bed, setting him between him and Pepper.</p><p>Peter crawled up next to Tony and curled himself into the man\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWuv you, daddy.\u201d </p><p>And if Tony cried that night, nobody would ever know.</p><p>****</p><p>Iron Dad tag list: <b></b><a>@tranquility-or-chaos</a>\u200b<br/><a>@a-black-pegasus</a>\u200b <br/><strike>@phiauniverse</strike> <a>@justsomeone-notimportant</a>\u200b</p><p>Baby For a Week tag list: <b></b><a>@sirasslessunicorn</a>\u200b <a>@muggle-who-lived</a>\u200b <a>@thefourthnorn</a>\u200b <strike>@jolandax13</strike> <a>@justsomeone-notimportant</a>\u200b <a>@thegraceofme</a>\u200b <strike>@generalsuitcaselightflap</strike> <a>@corkeecoderyt</a>\u200b <a>@kristin5687</a>\u200b <a>@thatfakepoison</a>\u200b <a>@mayfernandar5</a>\u200b <a>@pityandchiil</a>\u200b <strike>@quirkyoracle</strike> <a>@jake-the-snake-from-state-farm</a>\u200b <a>@ironfamjam</a>\u200b\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdQwBxG3YgSqxbVadasMAKA\">@vitrumpapilionum</a> <strike>@gq3668and5</strike>\u00a0</p><p>If there\u2019s a strike-through it means I wasn\u2019t able to tag you, sorry!!</p>",

What did you-\u201c Steve stopped in his tracks to see Tony turning towards him, stirring spoon in one hand and a baby in the other, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please watch him for a few minutes? I need to finish making his lunch and he\u2019s making that damn near impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, who is this exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201c</p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow, \u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d</p><p>Tony let out an exaggerated sigh, \u201cIt was one of Loki\u2019s tricks,\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Steve walked into the kitchen, holding his hands out towards Peter, \u201cHey little guy, why don\u2019t you come with me for a little bit?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared back at him, his hands fisted in Tony\u2019s shirt, then turned to look at Tony. </p><p>Tony only smiled down at him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay buddy. I need to finish making your lunch. I just need you to go with Steve for a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Peter turned back to the captain, his eyes suspiciously wet but reached out nonetheless.</p><p>Steve smiled and pulled the small bundle into his arms, heading over to the living room.</p><p>Tony watched as Steve set Peter on his lap and cooed at him, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of sadness at the idea of Peter going back to 16. He knew he wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s father, but he still felt upset at the fact that he never got to see Peter grow up.</p><p>Shoving his feelings down, Tony turned back to his task and finished making the mac and cheese.</p><p>He had just finished, putting some into a small bowl when he heard a glass shattering squeal and Steve screaming, \u201cPeter, get down from there!\u201d</p><p>Tony turned to see Steve staring up at the ceiling, his arms extended. Slowly, he raised his head, only to see Peter crawling on the MOTHER FUCKING CEILING.</p><p>That shit was unnerving when Peter did it as a <i>teenager</i>, but it was gut wrenchingly terrifying to see him do it as a <i>baby</i>.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Tony screamed, dropping the fork he had in his hand and running into the living room, \u201cHow the hell did he get up there?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must still have his powers-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, dipshit! I mean how did he get up there while you were watching him??\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s face fell and he looked guilty, \u201cHe was on the floor playing with the coaster I gave him as a distraction. I went to text Nat back and when I looked back up, he was up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogers, I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Pider!\u201d Peter screamed.</p><p>Tony turned his attention to the child hanging above him, \u201cYes Pete, you\u2019re a spider. Now will you please come down?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head and screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d and crawled away, Tony and Steve chasing after him.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Tony cursed under his breath, \u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? I have food ready.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of food Peter turned his little body, looking at Tony, \u201cOtay,\u201d He crawled back to the men and looked down at them.</p><p>The next moment Tony would never be able to unsee for the rest of his life.</p><p>Peter unhooked from the ceiling, free falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d The two men screamed.</p><p>Steve caught Peter in his arms, and Tony clutched at his chest, desperately trying to slow his breathing.</p><p>\u201cChrist Peter! You\u2019re gonna give me a f-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve chided.</p><p>\u201cFreaking heart attack.\u201d Tony corrected himself.</p><p>He took Peter from Steve and carried him over to the kitchen. He grabbed the bowl and set it on the table, setting Peter in his lap. Peter took the fork and began feeding himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that,\u201d Steve apologized.</p><p>Tony rubbed one of his temples, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. You caught him, so let\u2019s just call it even, yeah?\u201d Tony spoke, but his eyes never left Peter. He ran his hands through the boy\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d Steve added, before walking back to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI might actually need you and the others to help bring stuff up here later on. I had to uh, order a bunch of baby stuff.\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled, \u201cAlright, just let us know.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>Tony continued to watch Peter eat, but was so lost in thought he didn\u2019t notice Peter totally disregard the fork and begin eating with his hands.</p><p>He only noticed when Peter grabbed the bowl and almost throw it.</p><p>\u201cPete! Geez kid,\u201d He grabbed the bowl and set it aside.</p><p>\u201cMo\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWan\u2019 mo\u2019!\u201d Peter replied, \u201cHungwy.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, but obliged, giving Peter another bowl of the food.</p><p>Once he was done, Tony threw everything in the sink, then took one look at Peter and realized how much of a mess the kid had made.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s bath time.\u201d He huffed. He took Peter to the bathroom and drew a small bath, checking several times to make sure the water wasn\u2019t too hot.</p><p>When the time came to get the boy\u2019s dirty clothes off, Tony stopped.</p><p>He looked at Peter, who was sitting on the toilet seat, swinging his little legs, staring at the water.</p><p>He sighed, \u201cOkay, Pete. I guess this isn\u2019t any worse than having to help you use the bathroom, huh?.\u201d</p><p>But Peter just looked at Tony with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cI really hope you don\u2019t remember any of this,\u201d Tony muttered as he stood the boy on the floor, shedding his dirty clothes. </p><p>He picked Peter up, and began to slowly lower him into the tub, but Peter screamed once his toes touched the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat?? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tony pulled him back, immediately checking to see if maybe the temperature of the water was too cold or too hot.</p><p>\u201cNo swim!\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at him, dumbfounded, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019 swim!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to swim, Petey. Just sit. I promise you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Peter gave Tony his signature puppy dog eyes, \u201cPwomise?\u201d</p><p>It was damn near a miracle Tony\u2019s heart didn\u2019t burst out of his chest right there.</p><p>\u201cI promise, bud.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked at the water once more before nodding.</p><p>Tony again took Peter in his arms, and slowly lowered him into the water. Peter immediately sat in the shallow depth, using his hands to swish the water around.</p><p>While he was distracted, Tony grabbed a wash rag and submerged it, then put a small dollop of Pepper\u2019s body wash on it.</p><p>He figured her\u2019s would be more gentle on Peter\u2019s already sensitive skin.</p><p>He began to rub the child down, covering his body in foaming soap.</p><p>When he was finished, he grabbed the handheld shower head, and began to wash Peter\u2019s hair.</p><p>Peter leaned into Tony\u2019s touch, and Tony saw the boy\u2019s eyes beginning to flutter shut.</p><p>Figuring it was time for a nap, he quickly finished, draining the tub and wrapping Peter in the fluffiest towel he had.</p><p>When he got back into the bedroom, Tony realized he didn\u2019t have any clothes to fit Peter yet.</p><p>He decided to just use one of his shirts for the time being, so he grabbed an old Black Sabbath shirt from his drawer and pulled it over Peter\u2019s tiny body.</p><p>It was way too big on him, it looked like it was eating him whole. But it covered him and that was the point, right?</p><p>\u201cOkay, Petey, time for a nap.\u201d He gathered the boy in his arms and laid him in the middle of the bed. Deciding Peter couldn\u2019t get into any trouble while sleeping, he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Ony?\u201d Came Peter\u2019s sleepy voice.</p><p>Tony turned to see Peter sitting up from the bed, trying to rub the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo leave.\u201d Peter\u2019s lower lip trembled.</p><p>\u201cNo no, Petey. I\u2019m right here. No need to cry.\u201d Tony hurried back to Peter\u2019s side, grabbing his tiny hands.</p><p>\u201cNo leave.\u201d The boy repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Tony assured, climbing into bed next to him.</p><p>Peter crawled up onto Tony, resting his head on the man\u2019s chest.</p><p>Tony wrapped his arms protectively around him, and they both fell asleep like that.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>Tony grunted, but didn\u2019t open his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTony. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>Opening his eyes, he saw Natasha standing at the end of his bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s stuff is here.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of the boy, Tony realized the warm weight on his chest was gone, and shot up from the bed, \u201cPeter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He was still sleeping when we came up here, but I guess he heard us and waddled out there.\u201d Natasha said, pointing to the door, \u201cLet me tell you, you and Wanda are gonna have to fight over him. She won\u2019t let him go.\u201d She smirked.</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, getting out of the bed.</p><p>He followed the assassin out to the living room to see the entire team vying for Peter\u2019s attention.</p><p>Who knew a baby would bring them together like this?</p><p>But of course it\u2019s baby Peter. And everyone already loved Peter.</p><p>Once Tony got into Peter\u2019s line of sight, however, the boy squealed and squirmed from Clint\u2019s grasp, \u201c\u2018Ony!\u201d</p><p>Clint let go, and Peter clumsily bounded towards Tony, who scooped him up, \u201cHey bud, you having fun?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, \u201cSpeve gimme i\u2019 cweam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeve gave you ice cream?\u201d Tony snickered.</p><p>Steve rolled his eyes and Bucky laughed, \u201cI gave him some ice cream, he said he was hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have given him something with less sugar?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cSpeve wanted Peter to like him best.\u201d Bucky said through barely controlled laughter.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019re just pouty because Peter can actually say <i>my </i>name.\u201d</p><p>Steve ignored him, \u201cTony, do you want the crib in your room?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, \u201cYeah, please.\u201d</p><p>The two super soldiers took the crib that they had put together (how long had Tony been sleeping?) in Tony\u2019s room.</p><p>They all helped him put the stuff away in an organized manner so that he could find what he needed easily.</p><p>Soon Pepper came back, and the team had decided to have a movie night in their suite.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t bother refuting the idea, he knew they just wanted to be near Peter.</p><p>They chose a movie that would be appropriate for a two year old to watch (they settled on Frozen, since half the team hadn\u2019t seen it yet).</p><p>By the time the movie ended, Peter had snuggled in between Pepper and Tony, gripping a stuffed giraffe that he had so accurately named \u2018puppy\u2019, that came with the several toys that were delivered earlier. He was sound asleep, head resting on Tony\u2019s arm.</p><p>The team quietly left the suite, leaving Peter, Tony, and Pepper alone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Pepper whispered, carding her fingers through the boy\u2019s brown curls.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony agreed, smiling.</p><p>He picked up the boy and carried him to the bedroom, setting him down in the crib. He was thankful they had decided to change him into his new pajamas earlier in the night.</p><p>After both Tony and Pepper changed into their own pajamas, they climbed into bed, Tony with his arms around her.</p><p>He was half asleep when he heard a sniffle and a small whimper. Turning his head, he saw Peter standing in the crib, peeking over the railing.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Peter.\u201d Tony whispered.</p><p>Peter only whimpered again, reaching a hand out to grab at Tony.</p><p>\u201cJust bring him to bed,\u201d Came Pepper\u2019s sleep laced voice.</p><p>Tony startled, not aware that she was awake.</p><p>He huffed, and threw the covers off, walking over to Peter.</p><p>Peter smiled a big toothy grin and reached up for Tony.</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Tony sighed.</p><p>He picked up the boy and brought him back to the bed, setting him between him and Pepper.</p><p>Peter crawled up next to Tony and curled himself into the man\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWuv you, daddy.\u201d </p><p>And if Tony cried that night, nobody would ever know.</p><p>****</p><p>Iron Dad tag list: <b></b><a>@tranquility-or-chaos</a>\u200b<br><a>@a-black-pegasus</a>\u200b <br><strike>@phiauniverse</strike> <a>@justsomeone-notimportant</a>\u200b</p><p>Baby For a Week tag list: <b></b><a>@sirasslessunicorn</a>\u200b <a>@muggle-who-lived</a>\u200b <a>@thefourthnorn</a>\u200b <strike>@jolandax13</strike> <a>@justsomeone-notimportant</a>\u200b <a>@thegraceofme</a>\u200b <strike>@generalsuitcaselightflap</strike> <a>@corkeecoderyt</a>\u200b <a>@kristin5687</a>\u200b <a>@thatfakepoison</a>\u200b <a>@mayfernandar5</a>\u200b <a>@pityandchiil</a>\u200b <strike>@quirkyoracle</strike> <a>@jake-the-snake-from-state-farm</a>\u200b <a>@ironfamjam</a>\u200b\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdQwBxG3YgSqxbVadasMAKA\">@vitrumpapilionum</a> <strike>@gq3668and5</strike>\u00a0</p><p>If there\u2019s a strike-through it means I wasn\u2019t able to tag you, sorry!!</p></p>",

He didn\u2019t think about that. Could two year olds use the bathroom by themselves or did they need help? And If Peter needed help, he desperately hoped the kid wouldn\u2019t remember it when he was changed back.<b><br></b></p><p>He walked to the bathroom with Peter following suit.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d </p><p>Peter gave a shy nod.</p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s give this a go then, I guess.\u201d Tony took a deep breath.</p><p>He pulled down the boy\u2019s pants and lifted him so that he was sat on the toilet, but kept a firm grip on his underarms.</p><p>Peter kept his hands attached to Tony\u2019s arms, and the seconds passed by agonizingly slow before Peter shouted, \u201cAll done!\u201d</p><p>After getting his hands washed, Tony brought Peter back out to the living room where he remembered why they had even been out there in the first place.</p><p>\u201cOh shi-shoot, you need food,\u201d </p><p>\u201cHungwy!\u201d</p><p>Tony lifted Peter and headed to the kitchen, where he searched again for food, finding a box of mac and cheese, \u201cCan two year olds have this?\u201d He spoke to himself. He looked at Peter who was now chewing on his shirt, \u201cYeah I think this\u2019ll work for now.\u201d</p><p>He got to work making the kid\u2019s lunch, but it proved to be a difficult task with only one available arm. </p><p>Pepper strode back into the room, much to Tony\u2019s relief. </p><p>\u201cBabe, can you watch Pete while I make this?\u201d He called over his shoulder, attempting to stir the noodles while keeping a grabby Peter away from the oven. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Pepper apologized as she strode over to the pair, \u201cI\u2019m going to be late for a meeting if I don\u2019t leave now,\u201d She kissed her husband\u2019s cheek, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have one of the others come up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll never hear the end of it,\u201d Tony grumbled and Pepper chuckled. </p><p>\u201cSorry honey, I\u2019ll be back later this evening and I\u2019ll help you then.\u201d She reassured him and placed a quick kiss on Peter\u2019s forehead, making him giggle, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to me or him?\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>Pepper smirked, \u201cBoth of you. And I\u2019m talking to both of you when I say to <i>behave</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright alright, go before you\u2019re late.\u201d Tony told her, and she gave him one more kiss before heading out. </p><p>Sighing, Tony called to his AI, \u201cFRI, can you see if Steve\u2019s busy?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHe is currently reading on the common floor.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cGreat, tell him I need him to come up here,\u201d He glanced at Peter, \u201cAlso, go ahead and order anything a two year old might need. Food, clothes, toys, whatever. And a bed. I don\u2019t know how long this arrangement is going to be.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWill do, boss.\u201d</i></p><p>A minute passed before she spoke again, <i>\u201cMost everything will be delivered by this evening. There are a few things that will be here in the morning.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Tony. What did you-\u201c Steve stopped in his tracks to see Tony turning towards him, stirring spoon in one hand and a baby in the other, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please watch him for a few minutes? I need to finish making his lunch and he\u2019s making that damn near impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, who is this exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201c</p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow, \u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d</p><p>Tony let out an exaggerated sigh, \u201cIt was one of Loki\u2019s tricks,\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Steve walked into the kitchen, holding his hands out towards Peter, \u201cHey little guy, why don\u2019t you come with me for a little bit?\u201d</p><p>Peter stared back at him, his hands fisted in Tony\u2019s shirt, then turned to look at Tony. </p><p>Tony only smiled down at him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay buddy. I need to finish making your lunch. I just need you to go with Steve for a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Peter turned back to the captain, his eyes suspiciously wet but reached out nonetheless.</p><p>Steve smiled and pulled the small bundle into his arms, heading over to the living room.</p><p>Tony watched as Steve set Peter on his lap and cooed at him, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of sadness at the idea of Peter going back to 16. He knew he wasn\u2019t the kid\u2019s father, but he still felt upset at the fact that he never got to see Peter grow up.</p><p>Shoving his feelings down, Tony turned back to his task and finished making the mac and cheese.</p><p>He had just finished, putting some into a small bowl when he heard a glass shattering squeal and Steve screaming, \u201cPeter, get down from there!\u201d</p><p>Tony turned to see Steve staring up at the ceiling, his arms extended. Slowly, he raised his head, only to see Peter crawling on the MOTHER FUCKING CEILING.</p><p>That shit was unnerving when Peter did it as a <i>teenager</i>, but it was gut wrenchingly terrifying to see him do it as a <i>baby</i>.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Tony screamed, dropping the fork he had in his hand and running into the living room, \u201cHow the hell did he get up there?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must still have his powers-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, dipshit! I mean how did he get up there while you were watching him??\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s face fell and he looked guilty, \u201cHe was on the floor playing with the coaster I gave him as a distraction. I went to text Nat back and when I looked back up, he was up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogers, I swear to God.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Pider!\u201d Peter screamed.</p><p>Tony turned his attention to the child hanging above him, \u201cYes Pete, you\u2019re a spider. Now will you please come down?\u201d</p><p>Peter cocked his head and screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d and crawled away, Tony and Steve chasing after him.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Tony cursed under his breath, \u201cAren\u2019t you hungry? I have food ready.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of food Peter turned his little body, looking at Tony, \u201cOtay,\u201d He crawled back to the men and looked down at them.</p><p>The next moment Tony would never be able to unsee for the rest of his life.</p><p>Peter unhooked from the ceiling, free falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d The two men screamed.</p><p>Steve caught Peter in his arms, and Tony clutched at his chest, desperately trying to slow his breathing.</p><p>\u201cChrist Peter! You\u2019re gonna give me a f-\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve chided.</p><p>\u201cFreaking heart attack.\u201d Tony corrected himself.</p><p>He took Peter from Steve and carried him over to the kitchen. He grabbed the bowl and set it on the table, setting Peter in his lap. Peter took the fork and began feeding himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that,\u201d Steve apologized.</p><p>Tony rubbed one of his temples, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. You caught him, so let\u2019s just call it even, yeah?\u201d Tony spoke, but his eyes never left Peter. He ran his hands through the boy\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d Steve added, before walking back to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI might actually need you and the others to help bring stuff up here later on. I had to uh, order a bunch of baby stuff.\u201d</p><p>Steve chuckled, \u201cAlright, just let us know.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>Tony continued to watch Peter eat, but was so lost in thought he didn\u2019t notice Peter totally disregard the fork and begin eating with his hands.</p><p>He only noticed when Peter grabbed the bowl and almost throw it.</p><p>\u201cPete! Geez kid,\u201d He grabbed the bowl and set it aside.</p><p>\u201cMo\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWan\u2019 mo\u2019!\u201d Peter replied, \u201cHungwy.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, but obliged, giving Peter another bowl of the food.</p><p>Once he was done, Tony threw everything in the sink, then took one look at Peter and realized how much of a mess the kid had made.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s bath time.\u201d He huffed. He took Peter to the bathroom and drew a small bath, checking several times to make sure the water wasn\u2019t too hot.</p><p>When the time came to get the boy\u2019s dirty clothes off, Tony stopped.</p><p>He looked at Peter, who was sitting on the toilet seat, swinging his little legs, staring at the water.</p><p>He sighed, \u201cOkay, Pete. I guess this isn\u2019t any worse than having to help you use the bathroom, huh?.\u201d</p><p>But Peter just looked at Tony with a confused expression.</p><p>\u201cI really hope you don\u2019t remember any of this,\u201d Tony muttered as he stood the boy on the floor, shedding his dirty clothes. </p><p>He picked Peter up, and began to slowly lower him into the tub, but Peter screamed once his toes touched the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat?? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tony pulled him back, immediately checking to see if maybe the temperature of the water was too cold or too hot.</p><p>\u201cNo swim!\u201d</p><p>Tony looked at him, dumbfounded, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019 swim!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to swim, Petey.

He didn&rsquo;t think about that. Could two year olds use the bathroom by themselves or did they need help? And If Peter needed help, he desperately hoped the kid wouldn&rsquo;t remember it when he was changed back.<b><br /></b></p><p>He walked to the bathroom with Peter following suit.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you need help?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter gave a shy nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s give this a go then, I guess.&rdquo; Tony took a deep breath.</p><p>He pulled down the boy&rsquo;s pants and lifted him so that he was sat on the toilet, but kept a firm grip on his underarms.</p><p>Peter kept his hands attached to Tony&rsquo;s arms, and the seconds passed by agonizingly slow before Peter shouted, &ldquo;All done!&rdquo;</p><p>After getting his hands washed, Tony brought Peter back out to the living room where he remembered why they had even been out there in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shi-shoot, you need food,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hungwy!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony lifted Peter and headed to the kitchen, where he searched again for food, finding a box of mac and cheese, &ldquo;Can two year olds have this?&rdquo; He spoke to himself. He looked at Peter who was now chewing on his shirt, &ldquo;Yeah I think this&rsquo;ll work for now.&rdquo;</p><p>He got to work making the kid&rsquo;s lunch, but it proved to be a difficult task with only one available arm. </p><p>Pepper strode back into the room, much to Tony&rsquo;s relief. </p><p>&ldquo;Babe, can you watch Pete while I make this?&rdquo; He called over his shoulder, attempting to stir the noodles while keeping a grabby Peter away from the oven. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Pepper apologized as she strode over to the pair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be late for a meeting if I don&rsquo;t leave now,&rdquo; She kissed her husband&rsquo;s cheek, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have one of the others come up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ll never hear the end of it,&rdquo; Tony grumbled and Pepper chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry honey, I&rsquo;ll be back later this evening and I&rsquo;ll help you then.&rdquo; She reassured him and placed a quick kiss on Peter&rsquo;s forehead, making him giggle, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you talking to me or him?&rdquo; </p><p>Pepper smirked, &ldquo;Both of you. And I&rsquo;m talking to both of you when I say to <i>behave</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Alright alright, go before you&rsquo;re late.&rdquo; Tony told her, and she gave him one more kiss before heading out. </p><p>Sighing, Tony called to his AI, &ldquo;FRI, can you see if Steve&rsquo;s busy?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;He is currently reading on the common floor.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Great, tell him I need him to come up here,&rdquo; He glanced at Peter, &ldquo;Also, go ahead and order anything a two year old might need. Food, clothes, toys, whatever. And a bed. I don&rsquo;t know how long this arrangement is going to be.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Will do, boss.&rdquo;</i></p><p>A minute passed before she spoke again, <i>&ldquo;Most everything will be delivered by this evening. There are a few things that will be here in the morning.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Tony. What did you-&ldquo; Steve stopped in his tracks to see Tony turning towards him, stirring spoon in one hand and a baby in the other, &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you please watch him for a few minutes? I need to finish making his lunch and he&rsquo;s making that damn near impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, who is this exactly?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&ldquo;</p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow, &ldquo;Care to elaborate?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo;</p><p>Tony let out an exaggerated sigh, &ldquo;It was one of Loki&rsquo;s tricks,&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Steve walked into the kitchen, holding his hands out towards Peter, &ldquo;Hey little guy, why don&rsquo;t you come with me for a little bit?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stared back at him, his hands fisted in Tony&rsquo;s shirt, then turned to look at Tony. </p><p>Tony only smiled down at him, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay buddy. I need to finish making your lunch. I just need you to go with Steve for a little bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter turned back to the captain, his eyes suspiciously wet but reached out nonetheless.</p><p>Steve smiled and pulled the small bundle into his arms, heading over to the living room.</p><p>Tony watched as Steve set Peter on his lap and cooed at him, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a pang of sadness at the idea of Peter going back to 16. He knew he wasn&rsquo;t the kid&rsquo;s father, but he still felt upset at the fact that he never got to see Peter grow up.</p><p>Shoving his feelings down, Tony turned back to his task and finished making the mac and cheese.</p><p>He had just finished, putting some into a small bowl when he heard a glass shattering squeal and Steve screaming, &ldquo;Peter, get down from there!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turned to see Steve staring up at the ceiling, his arms extended. Slowly, he raised his head, only to see Peter crawling on the MOTHER FUCKING CEILING.</p><p>That shit was unnerving when Peter did it as a <i>teenager</i>, but it was gut wrenchingly terrifying to see him do it as a <i>baby</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; Tony screamed, dropping the fork he had in his hand and running into the living room, &ldquo;How the hell did he get up there?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He must still have his powers-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that, dipshit! I mean how did he get up there while you were watching him??&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s face fell and he looked guilty, &ldquo;He was on the floor playing with the coaster I gave him as a distraction. I went to text Nat back and when I looked back up, he was up there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rogers, I swear to God.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pider!&rdquo; Peter screamed.</p><p>Tony turned his attention to the child hanging above him, &ldquo;Yes Pete, you&rsquo;re a spider. Now will you please come down?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter cocked his head and screamed, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and crawled away, Tony and Steve chasing after him.</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking hell,&rdquo; Tony cursed under his breath, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you hungry? I have food ready.&rdquo;</p><p>At the mention of food Peter turned his little body, looking at Tony, &ldquo;Otay,&rdquo; He crawled back to the men and looked down at them.</p><p>The next moment Tony would never be able to unsee for the rest of his life.</p><p>Peter unhooked from the ceiling, free falling to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;PETER!&rdquo; The two men screamed.</p><p>Steve caught Peter in his arms, and Tony clutched at his chest, desperately trying to slow his breathing.</p><p>&ldquo;Christ Peter! You&rsquo;re gonna give me a f-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Tony</i>.&rdquo; Steve chided.</p><p>&ldquo;Freaking heart attack.&rdquo; Tony corrected himself.</p><p>He took Peter from Steve and carried him over to the kitchen. He grabbed the bowl and set it on the table, setting Peter in his lap. Peter took the fork and began feeding himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry about that,&rdquo; Steve apologized.</p><p>Tony rubbed one of his temples, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sweat it. You caught him, so let&rsquo;s just call it even, yeah?&rdquo; Tony spoke, but his eyes never left Peter. He ran his hands through the boy&rsquo;s curls.</p><p>&ldquo;Call me if you need anything.&rdquo; Steve added, before walking back to the elevator.</p><p>&ldquo;I might actually need you and the others to help bring stuff up here later on. I had to uh, order a bunch of baby stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve chuckled, &ldquo;Alright, just let us know.&rdquo; And he was gone.</p><p>Tony continued to watch Peter eat, but was so lost in thought he didn&rsquo;t notice Peter totally disregard the fork and begin eating with his hands.</p><p>He only noticed when Peter grabbed the bowl and almost throw it.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete! Geez kid,&rdquo; He grabbed the bowl and set it aside.</p><p>&ldquo;Mo&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wan&rsquo; mo&rsquo;!&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;Hungwy.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, but obliged, giving Peter another bowl of the food.</p><p>Once he was done, Tony threw everything in the sink, then took one look at Peter and realized how much of a mess the kid had made.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s bath time.&rdquo; He huffed. He took Peter to the bathroom and drew a small bath, checking several times to make sure the water wasn&rsquo;t too hot.</p><p>When the time came to get the boy&rsquo;s dirty clothes off, Tony stopped.</p><p>He looked at Peter, who was sitting on the toilet seat, swinging his little legs, staring at the water.</p><p>He sighed, &ldquo;Okay, Pete. I guess this isn&rsquo;t any worse than having to help you use the bathroom, huh?.&rdquo;</p><p>But Peter just looked at Tony with a confused expression.</p><p>&ldquo;I really hope you don&rsquo;t remember any of this,&rdquo; Tony muttered as he stood the boy on the floor, shedding his dirty clothes. </p><p>He picked Peter up, and began to slowly lower him into the tub, but Peter screamed once his toes touched the water.</p><p>&ldquo;What?? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Tony pulled him back, immediately checking to see if maybe the temperature of the water was too cold or too hot.</p><p>&ldquo;No swim!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looked at him, dumbfounded, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo; swim!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t swim?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to swim, Petey. Just sit. I promise you&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gave Tony his signature puppy dog eyes, &ldquo;Pwomise?&rdquo;</p><p>It was damn near a miracle Tony&rsquo;s heart didn&rsquo;t burst out of his chest right there.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise, bud.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked at the water once more before nodding.</p><p>Tony again took Peter in his arms, and slowly lowered him into the water.

I&rsquo;m right here. No need to cry.&rdquo; Tony hurried back to Peter&rsquo;s side, grabbing his tiny hands.</p><p>&ldquo;No leave.&rdquo; The boy repeated.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo; Tony assured, climbing into bed next to him.</p><p>Peter crawled up onto Tony, resting his head on the man&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>Tony wrapped his arms protectively around him, and they both fell asleep like that.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grunted, but didn&rsquo;t open his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.

He didn&rsquo;t think about that. Could two year olds use the bathroom by themselves or did they need help? And If Peter needed help, he desperately hoped the kid wouldn&rsquo;t remember it when he was changed back.<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>He walked to the bathroom with Peter following suit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you need help?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Peter gave a shy nod.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s give this a go then, I guess.&rdquo; Tony took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>He pulled down the boy&rsquo;s pants and lifted him so that he was sat on the toilet, but kept a firm grip on his underarms.</p>\n<p>Peter kept his hands attached to Tony&rsquo;s arms, and the seconds passed by agonizingly slow before Peter shouted, &ldquo;All done!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After getting his hands washed, Tony brought Peter back out to the living room where he remembered why they had even been out there in the first place.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh shi-shoot, you need food,&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hungwy!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony lifted Peter and headed to the kitchen, where he searched again for food, finding a box of mac and cheese, &ldquo;Can two year olds have this?&rdquo; He spoke to himself. He looked at Peter who was now chewing on his shirt, &ldquo;Yeah I think this&rsquo;ll work for now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He got to work making the kid&rsquo;s lunch, but it proved to be a difficult task with only one available arm. </p>\n<p>Pepper strode back into the room, much to Tony&rsquo;s relief. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Babe, can you watch Pete while I make this?&rdquo; He called over his shoulder, attempting to stir the noodles while keeping a grabby Peter away from the oven. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Pepper apologized as she strode over to the pair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be late for a meeting if I don&rsquo;t leave now,&rdquo; She kissed her husband&rsquo;s cheek, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have one of the others come up?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ll never hear the end of it,&rdquo; Tony grumbled and Pepper chuckled. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry honey, I&rsquo;ll be back later this evening and I&rsquo;ll help you then.&rdquo; She reassured him and placed a quick kiss on Peter&rsquo;s forehead, making him giggle, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Are you talking to me or him?&rdquo; </p>\n</p>",
