Every gust of wind brought an unwelcome feeling. One that he could only describe as bittersweet and unnerving as he watched the Titan disappear. With wide eyes, everyone saw him turn to ash along with his army and after that, there was nothing but a deafening silence.</p><p>\u201cDad? H-hey?\u201d You tried too, leaning in closer and placing your hand gently on his cheek.</p><p><i>Just a little bit longer</i>, Tony thought. He needed to stay just a little bit longer. For you, your sister, and Pepper. For Peter. Rhodey and Steve. He was doing the best he could, each breath he took was now numbered but he knew that he had to hold on. Even though his eyes fought to close and the glow of the reactor in his chest dimmed, he couldn\u2019t go just yet. He turned his head with all the strength he had left toward you and the boy who had managed to weasel his way into whatever broken shards of Tony\u2019s heart were left. </p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d Your shoulders sagged and your heart felt heavy with each breath you wished you could give to him and you wanted to be strong. Because he had always taught you to be but you couldn\u2019t. With Peter\u2019s arm around your waist, he held you as if it were enough and you started to cry more.</p><p>\u201cDad, no. Please. We- we won. You did it!\u201d</p><p>You were having a hard time finding the silver lining. You won but did you really? When you were in the midst of losing so much more with every second that passed. How could it really be considered a victory if the consequence was losing the very best of the team? The best parts of <i>you</i>?</p><p>As your tears continued to fall, you placed your hand on Tony\u2019s arm, pleading with him silently to just say something. You remained hopeful until the very last second, watching as the ugly shade of black creeped farther up your father\u2019s face and gasps for air he was taking in between pale white lips became grave and unsteady.</p><p>The others were now surrounding you, standing amongst the wreckage of the facility that they could no longer call home. Under the orange glow and dark clouds in the sky it was like the whole world fell silent, as if for one moment, all and any noise ceased to exist, seeming to already mourn their fallen hero.</p><p>Peter hangs his head, looking up through his own wet lashes and between sobs, he whispers, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tony.\u201d</p><p>All he wanted was to hear Tony\u2019s voice fill the silence. For him to tell him that it would be okay, that <i>he</i> was okay and that yes. They won. But he knew he couldn\u2019t. He never would again and all that mattered to him now, was you. </p><p>But it was Pepper who, with a gentle hand on his shoulder, pulled Peter up and into her arms for just a second before she took his place next to you.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026</p><p>Look at me.\u201d</p><p>You closed your eyes, listening to your mother\u2019s voice as she tried to be strong for the both of you. She sounded calm but this was after the storm and it didn\u2019t make any sense to you. There was fire and metal, dust and fog for miles and yet she was as gentle as ever.</p><p>Her hand came up to cover the glow in his chest with shaking fingers slowly sliding between his and he turned his head with all the strength he had left.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay,\u201d Pepper nodded, reassuring him and you did the same even though it truly felt like you never would be again. She placed her hand on the reactor, hiding the faint glow as he lifted his. He slowly looked at the both of you; his two favorite girls. He knew you would be okay. He always told you that you got your strength from your mother, because he never considered himself strong except he was and it rang clear in his last words.</p><p><i>I am\u2026 Iron Man.</i></p>",
