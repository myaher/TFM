Despite this installment&rsquo;s sheer emotionality (a great achievement for Marvel), I spent a quarter of the movie laughing <i>at</i> them and another laughing <i>with</i> them, because they just had so much <i>fun </i>making it.&nbsp;The mourning, endurance and hope of Endgame is all the more fitting, because in totality, it&rsquo;s a well-executed sendoff to the first decade of MCU and the cast that made it happen.</p>",

There\u2019s the whole you-can\u2019t-change-the-past\u2019s-future-because-your-visit-to-the-past-is-your-future, but you also have the changes-in-the-past-alter-the-past\u2019s-timeline. So, does this mean that the past is one timeline and the present is another? Because, to my understanding, they are the same timeline, since one is going back to one\u2019s own timeline. The timeline that someone visits is one\u2019s own, therefore a change in the past creates a new timeline and, consequently, doesn\u2019t allow for what is the present to exist. The movie isn\u2019t dealing with different universes, but with one same universe, thus, with one same timeline. </p><p>So, if one alters the past one <b>is</b> altering the future of the past, and, consequently, what was one\u2019s present. This is theoretically corroborated by the fact that the stones <b>have</b> to be returned to the exact moment and place where they were taken from, otherwise there will be a break in the timeline of the past. A break that creates a new timeline, which means a different sequence of events for that universe. Therefore, if you visit the past and alter it in any way, you alter the timeline and its future. So, as you can see, Markus and McFeely didn\u2019t really think through their time travel mechanics.</p><p>If the stones have to be returned so that the past is kept intact, as well as the timeline, Steve\u2019s decision to remain in the past, in order to have no impact in the present time, would mean that he didn\u2019t alter anything in the past. Which would mean that he would have let past atrocities just happen, otherwise he would incur in changing the timeline. Not only that, but if he did go back in time and actually married Peggy, like it\u2019s hinted that he did, he erased the existence of her children with the husband she actually had in the original timeline. And both things are absolutely appalling and completely out of character for Steve Rogers. Other than that, this would mean that Steve actually changed the timeline, so we have a problem in how the present in the movie remained the same.</p><p>Now, if we are to believe that alterations in the past create parallel timelines to the ones that brought about the present of the movie, which, in my opinion, isn\u2019t coherent to the idea of a timeline, we don\u2019t know what Steve has done, how he acted in that timeline. All we can do is suppose that, even though he built a family, he remained the same guy, he had the same character, and acted to make the world better while being a family man. However, this doesn\u2019t explain how he appeared as an old man in the other timeline that supposedly remained in existence unaltered.</p><p><a href=\"https://apensivelady.tumblr.com/post/184882104625/markus-and-mcfeely-confirmed-though-that-steve-was\" target=\"_blank\">The Russos said</a> that Steve created a different timeline when he went to the past and stayed there, hinting at the existence of parallel timelines, but they didn\u2019t tell us what happens in that timeline, nor how senior Steve goes back to the other timeline. </p><p>Differently, <a href=\"https://apensivelady.tumblr.com/post/184882104625/markus-and-mcfeely-confirmed-though-that-steve-was\" target=\"_blank\">Markus and McFeely said</a> that Steve didn\u2019t change the timeline, that he was the very husband that Peggy talked about in <i>Captain America: the Winter Soldier</i> and that he was the father of her children all along. This would mean that Steve would have knowledge of the things that would come to pass, and that he would have consciously decided to stay out of them in order that the timeline were kept intact.</p><p>The fact is that the closure of Steve\u2019s arc wasn\u2019t thought through, at all. So we don\u2019t actually know what happened to him. Steve had to go because Chris Evans was leaving the MCU, but he was given the worst possible ending. An ending that has nothing to do with who Steve Rogers had been throughout the MCU. I don\u2019t have a problem with Steve retiring from \u201cactive duty\u201d. Steve wouldn\u2019t be selfish for doing that. What I have a problem with is the manner in which Steve was retired in <i>Endgame</i>. It didn\u2019t take into consideration his whole character development in the MCU, which curiously was mainly written by Markus and McFeely themselves, and it left room for the interpretation that Steve chose to retire in a past he had full knowledge of, of how it would unfold, and that he consciously chose to live in it knowing he couldn\u2019t alter it. And this is what hurt me. That my favourite Marvel character was turned into something he could never be. So when I see people saying that if I believe this is what Steve did, then I do not know him, I can only answer by saying that the movie was constructed in a way that one can conclude that. And this is why my heart was broken. Because the Steve that I know was turned into a Steve that I do not know. Because the Steve that I know couldn\u2019t sit while so many atrocities unfolded all around him. I can\u2019t possibly believe that he could just retire and live a suburban life knowing very well all the bad things that were bound to happen. This isn\u2019t Steve Rogers. Steve Rogers wouldn\u2019t sit on the sidelines while Hydra was sure to rise and his best friend was sure to be abused and tortured by it.</p><p>Markus and McFeely, the Russos and everyone else that green lit this ending for Steve Rogers managed to turn him into something he could never be in just a couple of minutes. Because they couldn\u2019t conceive a manner of Steve retiring in the present. <a href=\"https://apensivelady.tumblr.com/post/184462814615/you-know-what-could-be-interesting-in-my-opinion\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote an option some time ago</a>, but I\u2019m sure there could have been many other ways of doing it. Steve didn\u2019t deserve an ending that leaves open the interpretation of him becoming everything he could never be.</p>",

Because the Steve that I know couldn\u2019t sit while so many atrocities unfolded all around him.

                "content": "<p><h1>A personal opinion on Steve Rogers&rsquo;s ending in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> </h1><p>Seeing all the discussions about Steve Rogers&rsquo;s ending in <i>Endgame</i> made me realise that the big issue with it is the fact that we don&rsquo;t know anything about what actually happened to him. </p><p>The rules set by the movie regarding time travel are completely flawed. There&rsquo;s the whole you-can&rsquo;t-change-the-past&rsquo;s-future-because-your-visit-to-the-past-is-your-future, but you also have the changes-in-the-past-alter-the-past&rsquo;s-timeline. So, does this mean that the past is one timeline and the present is another? Because, to my understanding, they are the same timeline, since one is going back to one&rsquo;s own timeline. The timeline that someone visits is one&rsquo;s own, therefore a change in the past creates a new timeline and, consequently, doesn&rsquo;t allow for what is the present to exist. The movie isn&rsquo;t dealing with different universes, but with one same universe, thus, with one same timeline. </p><p>So, if one alters the past one <b>is</b> altering the future of the past, and, consequently, what was one&rsquo;s present. This is theoretically corroborated by the fact that the stones <b>have</b> to be returned to the exact moment and place where they were taken from, otherwise there will be a break in the timeline of the past. A break that creates a new timeline, which means a different sequence of events for that universe. Therefore, if you visit the past and alter it in any way, you alter the timeline and its future. So, as you can see, Markus and McFeely didn&rsquo;t really think through their time travel mechanics.</p><p>If the stones have to be returned so that the past is kept intact, as well as the timeline, Steve&rsquo;s decision to remain in the past, in order to have no impact in the present time, would mean that he didn&rsquo;t alter anything in the past. Which would mean that he would have let past atrocities just happen, otherwise he would incur in changing the timeline. Not only that, but if he did go back in time and actually married Peggy, like it&rsquo;s hinted that he did, he erased the existence of her children with the husband she actually had in the original timeline. And both things are absolutely appalling and completely out of character for Steve Rogers. Other than that, this would mean that Steve actually changed the timeline, so we have a problem in how the present in the movie remained the same.</p><p>Now, if we are to believe that alterations in the past create parallel timelines to the ones that brought about the present of the movie, which, in my opinion, isn&rsquo;t coherent to the idea of a timeline, we don&rsquo;t know what Steve has done, how he acted in that timeline.
