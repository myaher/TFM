        "body": "<p><i>Summary: Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter\u2019s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</i></p><p><i>But he kept fading.</i></p><p><b>{warnings: drowning, graphic depictions of medical procedures}</b></p><p>The people the media had dubbed as the <i>\u2018Rogue Avengers\u2019</i> were recently pardoned for reasons largely unknown. Not even Peter knew why, though upon questioning Tony about it the man tensed up prompting the teen to back off. He supposed it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and if the general public weren\u2019t told why there\u2019s no reason he should\u2019ve been any different. However, now that they were all officially part of a team again, Pepper and T\u2019Challa decided the previously divided group needed to start having so-called bonding sessions. The awkwardness and tension between everybody was impossible to ignore, or so Tony and Rhodey told Peter one night during a lab session. Pepper said that it couldn\u2019t continue if they were to function normally on missions or in the battlefield, so she and (reluctantly) Tony organized a party set at the tower in typical Stark fashion.</p><p>To say Peter was nervous would be the understatement of the century.</p><!-- more --><p>When expressing his concern to May, she comforted him yet noted that he should turn those nerves into excitement. After all, it\u2019s not every day you get to hang out with the <i>Avengers</i>. Of course she was right, and of course he was excited but that anticipation was a mere speck compared to the storm of anxiety swirling in the pool of his gut. What if he did something stupid? Said something embarrassing? What if they kicked him out because he was a kid or didn\u2019t fit their standards of being a true hero.</p><p><i>What if they didn\u2019t like him?</i></p><p>Some of those thoughts may have been irrational\u2014 He\u2019s sure Tony wouldn\u2019t let the teen leave his sight\u2014 but they filled Peter\u2019s mind nonetheless. He didn\u2019t even really want to go to the gathering, but his mentor insisted, saying that despite him turning down an official spot on the Avengers he was still as much a part of the team as everyone else and the other members would need to get used to him being around. Peter guessed Tony was right and agreed, also deciding it better than to mention the fact that he knew the billionaire largely wanted Pete there to keep him grounded as well as a source of comfort. But that went unspoken.</p><p>So here Peter and Happy sat, stuck in a sea of Manhattan traffic. His Spidey-Senses were off the charts but he figured it was just because of the claustrophobia that came with being stuck amidst a swarm of dozens of cars that finally caused his pent up anxiety to come loose.</p><p>Happy honked and let out a colorful bout of curses due to some jerk in front of them who had carelessly swerved into the wrong lane at the wrong time and almost caused a pile-up. Aggressively rolling down the window and sticking his head out he shouted, \u201cLearn to use your turn signal, asshole!\u201d</p><p>All the while, Peter was trying to keep down the cafeteria made pizza he\u2019d had for lunch just hours prior. In an <i>hour </i>they\u2019d only managed to go three blocks. All this time sitting back against leather seating ensured his brain conjured up every possible embarrassing situation that could play out. That is, if they ever <i>got </i>to the damn party.</p><p>The teenager sighed as Happy slouched back into the driver&rsquo;s seat, grumbling to himself. Pete rested his elbow against the edge of the window and set his jaw into his palm, subconsciously bouncing his leg up and down so fast that Happy needed to tell the boy to stop as it was shaking the entire vehicle. Over the course of the next ten minutes he continued to change positions, shifting from one to the next in a desperate attempt to find one that would somehow calm him and ease the buzzing in the nape of his neck that was growing more irritating and impossible to ignore by the minute.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just swing to the tower?\u201d He finally asked before unbuckling his seatbelt, stretching his legs across the three back seats of the car, deciding that position made everything <i>much</i> worse, and ultimately going back to a normal position again. Happy straightened before answering.</p><p>\u201cBoss has strict orders that I not let you out of my sight until we get to the tower,\u201d he adjusted the mirror to get a better view of Peter who was now biting his fingernails. \u201cBesides, last I knew Tony\u2019s still fixing up your suit from when you decided it was a good idea to take on a lunatic who could spit fire all by yourself,\u201d Happy remarked. Peter sighed, eyeing the compartment in his backpack where his web-shooters were stashed.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve gone out without the mask,\u201d he mumbled, rolling down the window to breathe in some fresh air. A little girl skipped by with an Iron Man balloon. \u201cPlus, I have superpowers. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Peter could practically feel the eye roll radiating off Happy. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to bother telling you how stupid swinging around New York without your mask on is because I&rsquo;m sure you\u2019re well aware, but,\u201d he gripped the steering wheel a little harder. \u201cYou know how people have been about the pardoning. Just this morning some nut job tried to pull Pepper into his car to get information out of her.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart wrenched with concern. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little shaken, but fine. What I\u2019m saying is, if anybody thinks you know anything because of your internship, you could be at real risk and Tony\u2019s going to go to any lengths possible to prevent that. As am I,\u201d The car moved a few feet forward before lurching to a stop again, an echo of honks reverberating throughout the avenue. \u201cSo if we have to sit here for another hour, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Peter appreciated their concern, he really did. And he knew that Happy wasn\u2019t one to express such feelings so openly and this was a serious situation but god, his spidey-sense was going haywire and everything was becoming too much too much too<i> much\u2014</i></p><p>So when a gloved hand smashed a crowbar into his temple through the window and a previously activated smoke grenade was tossed into the car, Peter couldn\u2019t exactly say he was surprised.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Peter opened his eyes to his worn sneakers planted firmly on the familiarly pristine carpet of Happy\u2019s black Sedan. The teen felt groggy, much like the time he woke up in the med bay after getting shot in his abdomen by some street thug trying to rob Sub Haven. His head was fuzzy and it took him a moment or two to realize the awkward position he was situated in\u2014 Zip tied to the chicken handle screwed to the roof of the car. His arms were hanging above him, bent ever-so-slightly and his head was hanging forward just short of resting against the front passenger&rsquo;s seat. Peter let out a quiet groan, lifting his head while he attempted to gather his bearings. He was in the same spot he was in when whoever it was hit him with that crowbar\u2014</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His eyes snapped open, the boy now painfully aware of his surroundings. The car was nowhere near East 34th Street, instead parked by the docks of some old warehouse. The side of his head throbbed awfully as he turned his head to the left only to come face-to-face with a middle-aged man in a black hoodie grinning maliciously back. Peter started and backed up as far as he could against the door to put as much distance between himself and this cigar-smelling creep. One other man accompanied them in the car and was wearing a red ski mask, sat in the front seat while staring out at the sunset as if they hadn\u2019t just kidnapped a sixteen-year-old kid.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker,\u201d The man said casually with a Russian accent. \u201cI heard you\u2019re close with Stark, yes?\u201d</p><p>Peter said nothing in response, only staring back with what he hoped were hard eyes. Showing fear and weakness would only prove to this man that he\u2019d already gotten underneath Peter\u2019s skin, and vulnerability was the last thing he needed. If Pete had any chance of outsmarting this guy and escaping unscathed he needed at least some remnants of the upper hand.</p><p>The sun was only just beginning to disappear over the horizon so it couldn\u2019t have been long, which could be either a good or bad thing. They weren\u2019t far from the city but it was too soon for anybody to have noticed their absence if word hadn\u2019t gotten out already. Peter was unconscious before he could see whether or not these men made a scene of their kidnapping or did it as discreetly as they could, so either Iron Man was searching the skies and would be blasting these men into the Hudson within minutes, or Mr. Stark was waiting insouciantly for their arrival at the tower. Peter clenched his fists hard, just short of breaking skin. He was suddenly very aware of how uncomfortable having your arms hung above your head for so long was if the first twinges of muscle cramps were anything to go by.</p><p>When Peter still didn\u2019t answer, the man sighed and picked up the crowbar from where it was set on the floor. Peter tensed as his kidnapper gripped the jagged end firmly, jabbing the rounded steel into his stomach. The boy wheezed and made an attempt to further back into the door, but was met with little success.</p><p>\u201cWhen I ask a question,\u201d he flipped his hold on the crowbar and prodded the pigfoot along the teen\u2019s bobbing throat where he was still struggling to draw in a proper breath. \u201cYou answer. Capiche?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded and the man placed the tool gently into his lap, though it did little to relax the teen. He then leaned back casually against the opposite door with an unreadable expression plastered across his face, running his thumb against the polyester seatbelt absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re close with Stark?\u201d He asked again. Peter swallowed the lump in his throat, finally having recovered from the violent blow before answering.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d it came out less shaky than he thought it would, and the boy felt a mini-surge of confidence. \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>His abductor huffed a laugh at his nerve before sitting up straight and tipping forwards again. He clasped his hands together, staring at them for a moment before looking directly at Peter. \u201cI want to know why that scum was pardoned.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped. God, Happy was right. Happy was right and Peter didn\u2019t take him seriously and now he was zip tied in the back of a car with two strangers who probably had every intention of hurting him for this information. He should be by Tony\u2019s side right now, laughing off awkward conversations with unfamiliar members of the team but instead he was being threatened by some crazy Russian dude and his eerily silent friend.</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d The man shrieked, making Peter flinch. \u201cI am not interested in being here for long. I am not interested in hurting you. Just tell me what I want and I will release you,\u201d his voice got lower, \u201cbut I <i>will</i> do what I have to in order to get what I am looking for. Easy or hard way, you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m just an intern. I\u2019m not cleared to receive that kind of information!\u201d He reasoned. The man only grew more irritated, twisting his body to unlock the door. He shoved it open with a grunt and motioned for his accomplice to do the same, muttering a quick word that Peter didn\u2019t quite pick up on.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he announced, slamming the door while the ski mask-clad man shifted the gears and fiddled with the gas below the steering wheel. \u201cHard way it is.\u201d His accomplice appeared to finish whatever he was setting up and glanced over his shoulder at the Russian man who gave a nod. He yanked something harshly, took several swift steps backward, and the tires began screeching. The car remained in place for a moment as it struggled to gain traction and once it did the car sped forward, momentum pushing Peter up against the back of the seat as the vehicle rolled off of the dock and into the river below.</p><p>For a second Peter did nothing, shock and confusion clouding his thinking. But then the car began to sink faster than it should have as water poured into the car through wide holes drilled into the floor beneath the seats that Peter had failed to notice beforehand and he began to panic. Within seconds the car was already submerged halfway under the surface and the water pooling in the car reached Pete\u2019s ankles.</p><p>\u201cRethink your decision, Peter,\u201d The man\u2019s voice sounded through a mini-speaker that was haphazardly taped to the ceiling of the car just short of the windshield. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly rescue you, but only if I get what I want.\u201d</p><p>Peter clenched his fists in annoyance and fright, \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p><p>The teen\u2019s breathing began to pick up and he desperately tried to keep it under control as the car was now fully submerged. He didn\u2019t want to waste the limited air supply he may have and spiraling into a full-blown panic attack definitely wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cGive me an answer,\u201d the criminal said firmly. \u201cThe car\u2019s filling up quick, is it not?\u201d Peter clenched his jaw because yes, it absolutely was. It was pooling above his knees and creeping up towards his abdomen. At this rate he\u2019d be completely under in less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe me, they didn\u2019t tell me anything!\u201d He shouted, mind scrambling for something he could say to get him out of this. \u201cI\u2014 I can get it for you!\u201d He tried. \u201cI was on my way to see him earlier, just let me see Mr. Stark and I\u2019ll convince him to tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can get him to swaddle you with protection? So you can rat me out? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he spoke. The ice-cold water lapped just below Peter\u2019s neck, and he snapped the cuffs apart without care. There weren\u2019t any camera\u2019s visible and he needed to get out. \u201cLast chance, <i>\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a</i>,\u201d he spat. \u201cWhy where they pardoned?\u201d</p><p>Peter began slamming the window as hard as he could, his final response punctuated with each punch to the glass, \u201cI. Don\u2019t. <i>Know!</i>\u201d The liquid that now came to his chin was substantially hindering the force of his hits, not to mention the fact the Tony had modified the windows to be <i>bulletproof</i> didn\u2019t help his case. But he kept going regardless, striking the pane with all his might.</p><p>While doing so the boy distantly heard the two men conversing over the speaker before the Russian man announced, \u201cI believe you. In that case, I have no further use for you,\u201d Peter\u2019s heart dropped.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. The teen now had to tilt his head upwards to keep it above the surface of the water, his forehead resting against the ceiling of the car. \u201cNo! Come back!\u201d He pleaded. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d But it was useless. He was soaked head-to-toe and was about to drown if he didn\u2019t break this damned glass. So he squeezed his eyes shut, took in the deepest breath he could muster, and allowed the water to engulf him.</p><p>The silence that followed was excruciating. Compared to the fast-paced sound of water rushing in, his panicked huffing filling the air, and the crackling of his abductor\u2019s voice over that speaker, the complete and utter lack of noise was disturbing.</p><p>People always said drowning was the most peaceful way to go. Peter never understood that statement. He had never drowned, but it looked anything but peaceful and judging by the ache of his lungs that were screaming at him to take a breath, his inevitable demise would be agonizing. It was only then that he understood what they were talking about\u2014 the peacefulness was breathtaking (What an ironic choice of words, Peter thought bitterly). It wasn\u2019t that he was at peace because God, was he far from it, however even as his mind scrambled and fell apart in his struggle to survive it was oddly\u2026 serene.</p><p>Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad way to go.</p><p>The boy quickly shook that thought from his head, berating himself for almost giving up so quickly. How could he say that? How could he have thought of leaving everything behind, even for a second? Peter had his whole life ahead of him. Who would build LEGO sets with Ned, answer all the physics questions during decathlon meets? Tony wouldn\u2019t handle his loss well, the man\u2019s liver would probably give out as he tried to drink away the guilt. And God, <i>May</i>. She\u2019s lost everything and Peter would be damned if that woman had to lose him too.</p><p>Peter suddenly felt a surge of anger, at himself, at the men who took him, the rogue avengers, the government, at Mr. Stark for making this fucking glass so assuredly impenetrable. He hit harder than before, not caring that his knuckles had split open and stained the water a murky crimson.</p><p><i>Come on</i>, he thought. <i>Break. Break. Break!</i></p><p>Just as the teen\u2019s strength began wearing thin and his hope began to dwindle once again, the smallest of cracks appeared where the window was slightly smeared with blood. His lungs and muscles burned like hell but he wasn\u2019t going to give up now. Peter grit his teeth and drove his fist into the pane again. He never thought the sound of glass giving in could be so sweet.</p><p>The fractures in the pane spread further, resembling a spider\u2019s web more and more with each hit. Just a few more, he was almost there and\u2014</p><p>Peter\u2019s fist smashed through the window and the shards scattered into the liquid around him, a few pieces getting caught in his knuckles. But the teen didn\u2019t notice and he pushed himself through the opening as hard as he could, longing for the surface that seemed so close yet so far. In his desperation, Peter didn\u2019t spot the pointed, jagged edges of broken glass that remained attached to the frame of the window. It wasn\u2019t until he came to an abrupt halt that he looked down and pain overcame him in a harrowing wave.</p><p>One of the remaining shards had caught onto the boy\u2019s pant leg, slicing through the fabric and into the skin of his ankle. It dug into him like a fishing hook, anchoring him to the car. Peter couldn\u2019t help but let out a shout of pain, eyes going wide and mouth snapping shut when he realized that <i>shit</i>, that was all of his air. Suddenly the pain in his ankle didn\u2019t seem so bad as his lungs started to spasm with the need for air the sudden absence of it. Peter bent down, pulling at the glass shard itself because it was stuck into him at too awkward of an angle for him to take it out on his own. The glass needed to come with him, but damn this reinforced car because it wasn\u2019t coming loose. He was thrashing now as his muscles and mind went into one final fit of hysteria in a last-ditch attempt to get free. Little did Peter know that by doing so he was only embedding the shard further into his ankle but it didn\u2019t matter because he couldn\u2019t breathe, he needed to breathe, needed to breathe, <i>needed to the breathe.</i></p><p>Eventually Peter\u2019s movements began to slow down, his grip on the object going slack as he subconsciously focused all attention on not taking a breath. His chest rose and fell as his body\u2019s instincts took over, not caring whether he would breathe in water or not. But Peter refused to open his mouth, he couldn\u2019t. For Ned, for MJ, for Happy and Tony and May.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter\u2019s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</p><p>But he kept fading.</p><p>Even when a set of burly arms somehow detached his ankle from the glass, wrapping around his middle and pulling him towards the surface he continued to evanesce. Distantly he registered them getting closer to the evening sunlight, closer to air that he could safely breathe in.</p><p>But he had held it for so long. He couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. His mind was slipping, his vision was dissolving into nothingness and he no longer had control.</p><p>Water filled his lungs.</p><p>He took a breath.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cChill out, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whipped around, staring Sam Wilson down with a death glare that could intimidate even the most hardened criminals. \u201c<i>\u2018Chill out\u2019</i>?\u201d Tony fumed, taking a step towards him. Rhodey set his drink down at the bar and made his way towards the scene. \u201cThey were supposed to be here an hour and a half ago. Neither of them are returning my calls, I can\u2019t track their phones or the car they took, and you expect me to chill out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTones, hey,\u201d Rhodes crossed a hand over his friend&rsquo;s chest, guiding him away from where Sam had a hand placed threateningly over his wristwatch. The man appeared a moment away from summoning Redwing and Tony a second away from calling a suit. This definitely wasn\u2019t the vibe they had aimed for when planning a team bonding party. \u201cStand down. Starting a fight with Wilson won\u2019t help anyone,\u201d Tony grumbled, relaxing his fists and turning the other way to follow Rhodey to the bar. \u201cI\u2019m sure they just got stuck in a traffic jam. Happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took that into account, Rhodes,\u201d He politely declined a drink from the bartender and leaned against the counter, \u201cEven with traffic they should have been here a long time ago,\u201d the man picked up a generous amount of pecan cheese wafers from a platter and scarfed them down. Stress eating wouldn\u2019t help anyone either but hey, old habits die hard. Rhodes began to say something again but Tony tuned him out, staring at the double doors as if Happy would come stumbling through them with Peter safely in arms any second.</p><p>And they did.</p><p>Well, minus the \u2018safely\u2019 part.</p><p>The pair burst through the doors, startling everybody on the team so effectively they all went into their respective fighting stances. Happy and Peter were drenched head-to-toe, the older man out of breath, completely supporting the younger one who seemed to barely be breathing at all. In a blur, Tony sprinted towards the two as the head of security halfheartedly plopped Peter onto the ground. The boy stayed down, not moving an inch even when Tony appeared by his side.</p><p>\u201cHap, what the hell happened?\u201d Tony yelled, taking Peter\u2019s head in his lap. There was a half-healed gash at his temple and the boy\u2019s eyes were closed. His mouth was parted and skin white as a sheet, breathing gravelly and short. \u201cBruce, get your ass over here! Friday, prep the med team,\u201d the billionaire ordered. Banner appeared on the other side of Peter less than a second later, assessing him as best he could. Tony was now focused on the hideous wound in the kid\u2019s ankle that was bleeding profusely, and the man wondered how long it had been since he&rsquo;d sustained the injury. How much blood had he lost? How did he get a cut like that? Why were they so wet, and why did Peter\u2019s breathing sound like his throat had been put through a meat grinder? Seeing as the teen was unconscious the only person who could answer these question was Happy, whom Rhodey was surveying.</p><p>Tony jumped up, hesitant to leave Peter\u2019s side but trusting Bruce to take care of him and desperate to know what the hell happened. Rhodes seemed to have sat Happy down in a nearby chair, the man staring straight ahead with a frightfully bloody nose Tony previously failed to notice. The colonel was quietly coaxing him as the billionaire approached.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unresponsive,\u201d Rhodes said before Tony got the chance to speak. \u201cEither someone drugged him or he\u2019s got one hell of a concussion.\u201d</p><p>By now the rest of the team had gathered around the scene, some doing what they could to help, others not sure what that was and just watching. Wilson and a few others had already raced up to the Med Bay to help the nursing staff since most were off because of the party and Bruce was continuing to look over Peter with the assistance of Rogers. Tony would be lying if the idea of Steve being there instead of him didn\u2019t make him feel a surge of protectiveness and hostility, but logically he knew he was only helping and if Tony wanted to do the same he needed to get answers.</p><p>\u201cUnresponsive?\u201d Tony questioned rhetorically. \u201cHap, come on. What happened? Why do you two look like you just took a cat dive into the Hudson?\u201d The man didn\u2019t answer, staring straight through Tony. The man would\u2019ve kept trying but Bruce\u2019s next words sent ice through the man\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got water in his lungs!\u201d He shouted, \u201cWe need to get him to the Med Bay, <i>now!</i>\u201d</p><p>All thoughts of questioning Happy were wiped from Tony\u2019s mind. The next few minutes were a complete blur. Steve and T\u2019Challa helped carefully but quickly carry Peter down to the medical ward until the nurses met them halfway with a pair of stretchers. Nat and Rhodes handed Happy off, two nurses helping him while the rest focused on Peter, hooking the boy up to wires and checking his vitals as they wheeled him into a room.</p><p>\u201cPrep him for thoracentesis,\u201d Bruce instructed. Tony didn\u2019t have any clue as to what that procedure was but judging by the size of the needle a nurse he knew by the name of Zenia whipped out, it was nothing good.</p><p>\u201cWoah\u2014 Jesus, Bruce, what the hell\u2014?\u201d Tony began to ramble but was cut off by Banner\u2019s hand. He was highly focused as he typically was while working and hated distractions, but this was his kid and Tony demanded to know what was going on and what they were about to do to him. Bruce sighed before looking him in the eye and giving him a rundown.</p><p>\u201cPeter has water in his lungs. We aren\u2019t sure how much but we need to get it out and the only way to do that quickly and efficiently is by inserting a needle into the thorax and draining it from there into a bag. He\u2019s sustained other injuries but none are life-threatening and if we don\u2019t clear his lungs we could be facing organ failure because his blood isn\u2019t being properly oxygenated,\u201d he spoke carefully as the nurses worked together to lift Peter into a sitting position, remove his dampened sweater and lean him against the over-bed table so his back was bent and exposed. His skin was ghostly pale and the way his torso just barely rose and fell made Tony sick. Bile rose in his throat at the sight and he turned away before it could make him vomit. The man still didn\u2019t know what happened, but after the stunt that lowlife pulled with Pepper he had a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with the accords. If he was right and Peter suffered because of that\u2026</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Bruce spoke softly, slipping latex gloves on. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the best medical team on the East Coast. Let us do our job, alright? He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Tony prayed he was right.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>If there was one thing Tony never wanted to witness again, it was a goddamn thoracentesis. Maybe it was the fact that it was being performed on Peter of all people, but sickening squelch of the syringe puncturing his lung was unexpected and completely revolting. If that wasn\u2019t enough, watching murky fluid leak out of his body through a tube and into a waiting plastic bag was almost just as bad. The amount of water was more than they\u2019d anticipated, calling for them to switch out the collection pouch once for each lung. The procedure as a whole didn\u2019t take very long but it was borderline traumatizing for Tony nonetheless, he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the image of the kid bent over the table with two needles poking into his lungs out of his head for days to come. He\u2019d never been so grateful the teen was unconscious.</p><p>Tony guessed Rhodes or Friday had called May because not long after it was over the woman was bursting through the doors of the room and jogging towards her unconscious nephew. Joining Tony\u2019s side the woman, who was still clad in her own nursing scrubs, held her hand up to her mouth and let out a soft gasp.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what did they do to you?\u201d She whispered, clearly wanting nothing more than to comfort him but stayed put, knowing better than anyone that Bruce and the nurses needed to do their jobs.</p><p>A few of Peter\u2019s knuckles were fractured on each hand and fifteen minutes were spent painstakingly picking glass shards from the cuts on both, a clear indication that there was a struggle. The gash on his ankle looked like a stab wound but upon closer inspection was too sloppy and torn much too awkwardly to have been caused by a knife. The best they could do was treat it and wait until he or Happy woke up to ask what happened.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t for another hour and a half when they completed dressing Peter\u2019s injuries and treating Happy that the older man finally became coherent and responsive. Bruce was called into the room and Tony followed, knowing Peter was in safe enough hands with his aunt.</p><p>They entered Happy\u2019s room across the hall, the billionaire very surprised to see him already sitting up and talking to the nurse.</p><p>\u201cIs the kid okay?\u201d Happy was asking repeatedly. The nurse opened her mouth to respond but when the bodyguard caught sight of Tony and Bruce he completely disregarded her, almost jumping out of bed. The two men pushed him back down delicately, reprimanding him for being so careless.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Hap, do you have a death wish?\u201d Tony said. The man had his head bandaged, nose also wrapped as it had been severely broken. Getting up so fast was a sure-fire way to collapse and hit his already fractured skull on the ground.</p><p>\u201cPeter, is he\u2014? I tried to\u2014 but they were\u2014 I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he stumbled over his words, looking on the verge of tears. It caught Tony off guard. He\u2019d never seen the man so vulnerable and emotional.</p><p>\u201cPeter will be fine,\u201d Bruce cut in. Happy sagged with relief, closing his eyes and sinking into the sheets. \u201cHappy, can you tell us what happened?\u201d The doctor asked gently.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Happy muttered under his breath, vigorously rubbing his face before meeting Tony\u2019s eyes with the most undeniably apologetic look he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cWe were on our way to the tower,\u201d he started, looking down. \u201cWe were stuck in traffic, stopped beside an alleyway. They came up and threw some kind of gas in. I got out before breathing it all in but Peter was already out cold in the backseat. They dragged me into the alley and\u2014\u201c he stopped, eyebrows furrowing as he concentrated on trying to remember the following events. \u201cI guess they hit my head pretty hard. Everything else is there in bits and pieces. I remember they took the car, they disabled the tracking device and tossed out his phone but the kid had those spider tracer doohickies in his bag. I think I used those to find him. I\u2019m not so sure how I got there, but I know that they brought him to the docks and drove the car into the water with\u2014 with Peter in it,\u201d Tony grit his teeth. <i>Oh</i>. \u201cI knocked those bastard\u2019s out and dove after him. Everything else up until ten minutes ago is gone. I dunno why I didn\u2019t call for backup, I\u2019m so sorry, Tony. It should have never happened in the\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Tony said, placing a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou did just fine, Hap. The kid\u2019s alive and he\u2019s going to be okay, all thanks to you. It\u2019s not your fault some lunatics went after Peter.&ldquo;</p><p>\u201cExactly. And with the damage done to your head, it\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re conscious now, much less able to accomplish all that. When you came in it was like you were in a trance, your brain must have been focused on getting Peter to the safest place possible, which is here,\u201d Bruce nodded, squeezing his shoulder in reassurance. \u201cLike Tony said, you did a fantastic job. Now <i>rest</i>. Let your body recover. And don\u2019t make me sedate you,\u201d he warned, pointing a finger at the bodyguard. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Happy raised in hands in defense, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, doc. I think I could sleep for the next century.\u201d</p><p>With that problem settled, Tony returned to Peter\u2019s side and got started on the next one\u2014 apprehending the numbskulls who caused this problem in the first place. The billionaire tracked down the car just as Happy had, locating the spider-tracers with ease. He notified the authorities and Rhodey suited up to deal with any <i>problems</i> they may encounter and, as May put it, give them \u201ca good clobbering\u201d. Not too long after leaving the tower Tony was notified that the two men were in custody and if the bruised and bloody mugshots were anything to go by, Rhodes kept up on his promise. Apparently they had some vendetta against Cap and his entourage, but as long as the two were no longer a threat Tony couldn\u2019t give two shits what their reasoning was. There was no excuse for kidnapping a child, especially one as innocent and undeserving as Peter.</p><p>Speaking of, the kid didn\u2019t wake up until early the next morning. Four, to be exact, but it wasn\u2019t like anyone got much sleep anyways. It was fairly touch-and-go all night since they could only estimate how long Peter was breathing with liquid in his lungs, so the extent of damage was TBD. His organs were working fine however if his blood wasn\u2019t sufficiently oxygenated, there was a high chance of brain damage and it was almost impossible to tell while unconscious. So when he woke up so soon, it was a major relief for everybody.</p><p>The boy awoke and immediately tensed up, only relaxing when his eyes landed on May and Tony. He squeezed his eyes shut and winced in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling, bud?\u201d Tony asked, pressing the call button. May smiled down at her nephew, running her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cMy chest feels like it got rammed by a truck,\u201d he croaked. Tony and May both grimaced at the teen\u2019s voice. It was hellishly thick and raspy, somewhat reminding the billionaire of how he sounded following the abysmal waterboarding in Afghanistan. The man shook the thought from his head before his mind got lost in that dark place, but the comparison struck sorrow into his heart. The thought of Peter going through something as dreadful and vile as drowning sickened the man.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s expected,\u201d Bruce announced as he entered the room, accompanied by nurse Zenia. \u201cDo you feel any abnormalities outside of the discomfort?\u201d He asked, suddenly leaning over him and shining a penlight in the teen\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWoah, Doctor Banner, I\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you dizzy? Trouble breathing? Any pain? Can you tell me your full name and date of birth?\u201d Peter obliged, but seemed very uncomfortable at being poked and prodded so promptly after awakening. \u201cOpen,\u201d Bruce commanded, sticking a thermometer under the boy\u2019s tongue. While he waited and Zenia took his pulse and blood pressure at the same time, Pete glanced over at his aunt with narrowed eyes. She in turn looked up at Tony, a silent exchange that told him to get Banner to lay off.</p><p>\u201cBruce, could we just\u2014 give him a little space, please?\u201d Tony spoke. The thermometer beeped and though the doctor looked less than satisfied, but nevertheless nodded at Zenia who gathered the vitals cart and wheeled it out. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the first time Mr. Stark has told somebody to <i>stop</i> fussing over me,\u201d Peter remarked. Tony rolled his eyes, however felt very much relieved now that Pete was cracking jokes.</p><p>\u201cSo, no brain damage then?\u201d May asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t appear to be,\u201d Bruce responded, removing his glasses. \u201cDo you want to ask him some questions, Tony?\u201d</p><p>The billionaire sighed, grabbing hold of Peter\u2019s hand. The teen\u2019s skin was still ice-cold and the man felt a sudden urge to wrap him in every blanket the tower owned. \u201cWhat do you remember about the attack, Pete?\u201d</p><p>The small grin the boy had disappeared from his face and his eyes downcast, grip on Tony\u2019s fingers tightening ever-so-slightly as he seemed to recall the events of the previous night. He opened his mouth once before clamping it shut again, repeating that action three times before finally speaking.</p><p>\u201cWe were on our way to the party,\u201d he said, eyes trained on the tube that led to his nasal cannula. \u201cMy spider-sense was ringing like crazy, but I figured it was just nerves. Then somebody cracked a crowbar into the side of my head and threw these gas thingies in. I blacked out after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Bruce urged.</p><p>\u201cI woke up in the back on the car handcuffed to the handlebar on the ceiling. There was a Russian man and some guy with a ski-mask on. The Russian one asked me why Mr. Rogers and his friends were pardoned, but he didn\u2019t believe me when I told him no and\u2014 and set the car to drive into the river,\u201d May squeezed Peter\u2019s wrist reassuringly when he hesitated. \u201cUm, they kept asking through a speaker while the water was filling up the car through holes they must\u2019ve drilled before I woke up. Eventually they believed me but it was already up to my chin and they just\u2014 <i>left</i> me there. I started punching the glass,\u201d he glanced over his bandaged knuckles, taking in a long, deep breath as if the room would fill with water any second. \u201cBut they\u2019re bulletproof and the water had filled the car so it was even harder. I\u2014 I kept going even when it hurt but it got so hard to hold my breath and oh my god, May, I thought I was going to <i>die</i> down there,\u201d a few tears pricked at the boy\u2019s eyes but he pushed them back, squeezing his eyes shut as his aunt engulfed him in a hug. Tony very gently clasped his hand a little tighter as he continued to recount the story into May\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of you guys kept me going. I broke the window but I guess a piece of glass was still stuck in the framing because it caught on my ankle and trapped me there. I couldn\u2019t get it out and started to black out but\u2014 somebody saved me? Was it\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy,\u201d Tony finished. \u201cHe brought you here. Crashed our party. Which was going <i>egregiously</i> without you, might I add.\u201d</p><p>May pulled away and Peter let out a small giggle. Tony loved and hated it because it filled him with love and affection but at the same time reminded the man of just how small and young the boy was. Those men had just left him there to drown. God, as soon as he could Tony swore he would fly straight to whatever station they were being held at and deliver a beating twice that of Rhodey\u2019s.</p><p>But for now the kid needed him, and he wouldn\u2019t leave his side until he was bouncing off the walls, rambling on about the newest version of web fluid he\u2019d brainstormed or latest news on the upcoming Star Wars film.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Peter asked after Bruce completed all the required tests and they\u2019d settled in with some oh-so-tasty ice chips. \u201cWhy <i>was</i> Mr. Rogers pardoned?\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed. All this trouble for something so small and insignificant. The UN was planning on announcing everything in the coming days but for some bullshit legal reasons and to \u201cprevent panic\u201d they couldn\u2019t tell the public that. Clearly, it only caused further hysteria and drove people to attempt to kidnap and succeed in kidnapping Stark Industries personnel. Tony would be having a lengthy word with whoever\u2019s idea it was to hold off on sharing the information, legalities be damned.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t hurt to tell the kid now, would it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026\u201d</p>",

After all, it\u2019s not every day you get to hang out with the <i>Avengers</i>. Of course she was right, and of course he was excited but that anticipation was a mere speck compared to the storm of anxiety swirling in the pool of his gut. What if he did something stupid? Said something embarrassing? What if they kicked him out because he was a kid or didn\u2019t fit their standards of being a true hero.</p><p><i>What if they didn\u2019t like him?</i></p><p>Some of those thoughts may have been irrational\u2014 He\u2019s sure Tony wouldn\u2019t let the teen leave his sight\u2014 but they filled Peter\u2019s mind nonetheless. He didn\u2019t even really want to go to the gathering, but his mentor insisted, saying that despite him turning down an official spot on the Avengers he was still as much a part of the team as everyone else and the other members would need to get used to him being around. Peter guessed Tony was right and agreed, also deciding it better than to mention the fact that he knew the billionaire largely wanted Pete there to keep him grounded as well as a source of comfort. But that went unspoken.</p><p>So here Peter and Happy sat, stuck in a sea of Manhattan traffic. His Spidey-Senses were off the charts but he figured it was just because of the claustrophobia that came with being stuck amidst a swarm of dozens of cars that finally caused his pent up anxiety to come loose.</p><p>Happy honked and let out a colorful bout of curses due to some jerk in front of them who had carelessly swerved into the wrong lane at the wrong time and almost caused a pile-up. Aggressively rolling down the window and sticking his head out he shouted, \u201cLearn to use your turn signal, asshole!\u201d</p><p>All the while, Peter was trying to keep down the cafeteria made pizza he\u2019d had for lunch just hours prior. In an <i>hour </i>they\u2019d only managed to go three blocks. All this time sitting back against leather seating ensured his brain conjured up every possible embarrassing situation that could play out. That is, if they ever <i>got </i>to the damn party.</p><p>The teenager sighed as Happy slouched back into the driver\u2019s seat, grumbling to himself. Pete rested his elbow against the edge of the window and set his jaw into his palm, subconsciously bouncing his leg up and down so fast that Happy needed to tell the boy to stop as it was shaking the entire vehicle. Over the course of the next ten minutes he continued to change positions, shifting from one to the next in a desperate attempt to find one that would somehow calm him and ease the buzzing in the nape of his neck that was growing more irritating and impossible to ignore by the minute.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just swing to the tower?\u201d He finally asked before unbuckling his seatbelt, stretching his legs across the three back seats of the car, deciding that position made everything <i>much</i> worse, and ultimately going back to a normal position again. Happy straightened before answering.</p><p>\u201cBoss has strict orders that I not let you out of my sight until we get to the tower,\u201d he adjusted the mirror to get a better view of Peter who was now biting his fingernails. \u201cBesides, last I knew Tony\u2019s still fixing up your suit from when you decided it was a good idea to take on a lunatic who could spit fire all by yourself,\u201d Happy remarked. Peter sighed, eyeing the compartment in his backpack where his web-shooters were stashed.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve gone out without the mask,\u201d he mumbled, rolling down the window to breathe in some fresh air. A little girl skipped by with an Iron Man balloon. \u201cPlus, I have superpowers. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Peter could practically feel the eye roll radiating off Happy. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to bother telling you how stupid swinging around New York without your mask on is because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, but,\u201d he gripped the steering wheel a little harder. \u201cYou know how people have been about the pardoning. Just this morning some nut job tried to pull Pepper into his car to get information out of her.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart wrenched with concern. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little shaken, but fine. What I\u2019m saying is, if anybody thinks you know anything because of your internship, you could be at real risk and Tony\u2019s going to go to any lengths possible to prevent that. As am I,\u201d The car moved a few feet forward before lurching to a stop again, an echo of honks reverberating throughout the avenue. \u201cSo if we have to sit here for another hour, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Peter appreciated their concern, he really did. And he knew that Happy wasn\u2019t one to express such feelings so openly and this was a serious situation but god, his spidey-sense was going haywire and everything was becoming too much too much too<i> much\u2014</i></p><p>So when a gloved hand smashed a crowbar into his temple through the window and a previously activated smoke grenade was tossed into the car, Peter couldn\u2019t exactly say he was surprised.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Peter opened his eyes to his worn sneakers planted firmly on the familiarly pristine carpet of Happy\u2019s black Sedan. The teen felt groggy, much like the time he woke up in the med bay after getting shot in his abdomen by some street thug trying to rob Sub Haven. His head was fuzzy and it took him a moment or two to realize the awkward position he was situated in\u2014 Zip tied to the chicken handle screwed to the roof of the car. His arms were hanging above him, bent ever-so-slightly and his head was hanging forward just short of resting against the front passenger\u2019s seat. Peter let out a quiet groan, lifting his head while he attempted to gather his bearings. He was in the same spot he was in when whoever it was hit him with that crowbar\u2014</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His eyes snapped open, the boy now painfully aware of his surroundings. The car was nowhere near East 34th Street, instead parked by the docks of some old warehouse. The side of his head throbbed awfully as he turned his head to the left only to come face-to-face with a middle-aged man in a black hoodie grinning maliciously back. Peter started and backed up as far as he could against the door to put as much distance between himself and this cigar-smelling creep. One other man accompanied them in the car and was wearing a red ski mask, sat in the front seat while staring out at the sunset as if they hadn\u2019t just kidnapped a sixteen-year-old kid.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker,\u201d The man said casually with a Russian accent. \u201cI heard you\u2019re close with Stark, yes?\u201d</p><p>Peter said nothing in response, only staring back with what he hoped were hard eyes. Showing fear and weakness would only prove to this man that he\u2019d already gotten underneath Peter\u2019s skin, and vulnerability was the last thing he needed. If Pete had any chance of outsmarting this guy and escaping unscathed he needed at least some remnants of the upper hand.</p><p>The sun was only just beginning to disappear over the horizon so it couldn\u2019t have been long, which could be either a good or bad thing. They weren\u2019t far from the city but it was too soon for anybody to have noticed their absence if word hadn\u2019t gotten out already. Peter was unconscious before he could see whether or not these men made a scene of their kidnapping or did it as discreetly as they could, so either Iron Man was searching the skies and would be blasting these men into the Hudson within minutes, or Mr. Stark was waiting insouciantly for their arrival at the tower. Peter clenched his fists hard, just short of breaking skin. He was suddenly very aware of how uncomfortable having your arms hung above your head for so long was if the first twinges of muscle cramps were anything to go by.</p><p>When Peter still didn\u2019t answer, the man sighed and picked up the crowbar from where it was set on the floor. Peter tensed as his kidnapper gripped the jagged end firmly, jabbing the rounded steel into his stomach. The boy wheezed and made an attempt to further back into the door, but was met with little success.</p><p>\u201cWhen I ask a question,\u201d he flipped his hold on the crowbar and prodded the pigfoot along the teen\u2019s bobbing throat where he was still struggling to draw in a proper breath. \u201cYou answer. Capiche?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded and the man placed the tool gently into his lap, though it did little to relax the teen. He then leaned back casually against the opposite door with an unreadable expression plastered across his face, running his thumb against the polyester seatbelt absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re close with Stark?\u201d He asked again. Peter swallowed the lump in his throat, finally having recovered from the violent blow before answering.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d it came out less shaky than he thought it would, and the boy felt a mini-surge of confidence. \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>His abductor huffed a laugh at his nerve before sitting up straight and tipping forwards again. He clasped his hands together, staring at them for a moment before looking directly at Peter. \u201cI want to know why that scum was pardoned.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped. God, Happy was right. Happy was right and Peter didn\u2019t take him seriously and now he was zip tied in the back of a car with two strangers who probably had every intention of hurting him for this information. He should be by Tony\u2019s side right now, laughing off awkward conversations with unfamiliar members of the team but instead he was being threatened by some crazy Russian dude and his eerily silent friend.</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d The man shrieked, making Peter flinch. \u201cI am not interested in being here for long. I am not interested in hurting you. Just tell me what I want and I will release you,\u201d his voice got lower, \u201cbut I <i>will</i> do what I have to in order to get what I am looking for. Easy or hard way, you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m just an intern. I\u2019m not cleared to receive that kind of information!\u201d He reasoned. The man only grew more irritated, twisting his body to unlock the door. He shoved it open with a grunt and motioned for his accomplice to do the same, muttering a quick word that Peter didn\u2019t quite pick up on.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he announced, slamming the door while the ski mask-clad man shifted the gears and fiddled with the gas below the steering wheel. \u201cHard way it is.\u201d His accomplice appeared to finish whatever he was setting up and glanced over his shoulder at the Russian man who gave a nod. He yanked something harshly, took several swift steps backward, and the tires began screeching. The car remained in place for a moment as it struggled to gain traction and once it did the car sped forward, momentum pushing Peter up against the back of the seat as the vehicle rolled off of the dock and into the river below.</p><p>For a second Peter did nothing, shock and confusion clouding his thinking. But then the car began to sink faster than it should have as water poured into the car through wide holes drilled into the floor beneath the seats that Peter had failed to notice beforehand and he began to panic. Within seconds the car was already submerged halfway under the surface and the water pooling in the car reached Pete\u2019s ankles.</p><p>\u201cRethink your decision, Peter,\u201d The man\u2019s voice sounded through a mini-speaker that was haphazardly taped to the ceiling of the car just short of the windshield. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly rescue you, but only if I get what I want.\u201d</p><p>Peter clenched his fists in annoyance and fright, \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p><p>The teen\u2019s breathing began to pick up and he desperately tried to keep it under control as the car was now fully submerged. He didn\u2019t want to waste the limited air supply he may have and spiraling into a full-blown panic attack definitely wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cGive me an answer,\u201d the criminal said firmly. \u201cThe car\u2019s filling up quick, is it not?\u201d Peter clenched his jaw because yes, it absolutely was. It was pooling above his knees and creeping up towards his abdomen. At this rate he\u2019d be completely under in less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe me, they didn\u2019t tell me anything!\u201d He shouted, mind scrambling for something he could say to get him out of this. \u201cI\u2014 I can get it for you!\u201d He tried. \u201cI was on my way to see him earlier, just let me see Mr. Stark and I\u2019ll convince him to tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can get him to swaddle you with protection? So you can rat me out? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he spoke. The ice-cold water lapped just below Peter\u2019s neck, and he snapped the cuffs apart without care. There weren\u2019t any camera\u2019s visible and he needed to get out. \u201cLast chance, <i>\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a</i>,\u201d he spat. \u201cWhy where they pardoned?\u201d</p><p>Peter began slamming the window as hard as he could, his final response punctuated with each punch to the glass, \u201cI. Don\u2019t. <i>Know!</i>\u201d The liquid that now came to his chin was substantially hindering the force of his hits, not to mention the fact the Tony had modified the windows to be <i>bulletproof</i> didn\u2019t help his case. But he kept going regardless, striking the pane with all his might.</p><p>While doing so the boy distantly heard the two men conversing over the speaker before the Russian man announced, \u201cI believe you. In that case, I have no further use for you,\u201d Peter\u2019s heart dropped.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. The teen now had to tilt his head upwards to keep it above the surface of the water, his forehead resting against the ceiling of the car. \u201cNo! Come back!\u201d He pleaded. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d But it was useless. He was soaked head-to-toe and was about to drown if he didn\u2019t break this damned glass. So he squeezed his eyes shut, took in the deepest breath he could muster, and allowed the water to engulf him.</p><p>The silence that followed was excruciating. Compared to the fast-paced sound of water rushing in, his panicked huffing filling the air, and the crackling of his abductor\u2019s voice over that speaker, the complete and utter lack of noise was disturbing.</p><p>People always said drowning was the most peaceful way to go. Peter never understood that statement. He had never drowned, but it looked anything but peaceful and judging by the ache of his lungs that were screaming at him to take a breath, his inevitable demise would be agonizing. It was only then that he understood what they were talking about\u2014 the peacefulness was breathtaking (What an ironic choice of words, Peter thought bitterly). It wasn\u2019t that he was at peace because God, was he far from it, however even as his mind scrambled and fell apart in his struggle to survive it was oddly\u2026 serene.</p><p>Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad way to go.</p><p>The boy quickly shook that thought from his head, berating himself for almost giving up so quickly. How could he say that? How could he have thought of leaving everything behind, even for a second? Peter had his whole life ahead of him. Who would build LEGO sets with Ned, answer all the physics questions during decathlon meets? Tony wouldn\u2019t handle his loss well, the man\u2019s liver would probably give out as he tried to drink away the guilt. And God, <i>May</i>. She\u2019s lost everything and Peter would be damned if that woman had to lose him too.</p><p>Peter suddenly felt a surge of anger, at himself, at the men who took him, the rogue avengers, the government, at Mr. Stark for making this fucking glass so assuredly impenetrable. He hit harder than before, not caring that his knuckles had split open and stained the water a murky crimson.</p><p><i>Come on</i>, he thought. <i>Break. Break. Break!</i></p><p>Just as the teen\u2019s strength began wearing thin and his hope began to dwindle once again, the smallest of cracks appeared where the window was slightly smeared with blood. His lungs and muscles burned like hell but he wasn\u2019t going to give up now. Peter grit his teeth and drove his fist into the pane again. He never thought the sound of glass giving in could be so sweet.</p><p>The fractures in the pane spread further, resembling a spider\u2019s web more and more with each hit. Just a few more, he was almost there and\u2014</p><p>Peter\u2019s fist smashed through the window and the shards scattered into the liquid around him, a few pieces getting caught in his knuckles. But the teen didn\u2019t notice and he pushed himself through the opening as hard as he could, longing for the surface that seemed so close yet so far. In his desperation, Peter didn\u2019t spot the pointed, jagged edges of broken glass that remained attached to the frame of the window. It wasn\u2019t until he came to an abrupt halt that he looked down and pain overcame him in a harrowing wave.</p><p>One of the remaining shards had caught onto the boy\u2019s pant leg, slicing through the fabric and into the skin of his ankle. It dug into him like a fishing hook, anchoring him to the car. Peter couldn\u2019t help but let out a shout of pain, eyes going wide and mouth snapping shut when he realized that <i>shit</i>, that was all of his air. Suddenly the pain in his ankle didn\u2019t seem so bad as his lungs started to spasm with the need for air the sudden absence of it. Peter bent down, pulling at the glass shard itself because it was stuck into him at too awkward of an angle for him to take it out on his own. The glass needed to come with him, but damn this reinforced car because it wasn\u2019t coming loose. He was thrashing now as his muscles and mind went into one final fit of hysteria in a last-ditch attempt to get free. Little did Peter know that by doing so he was only embedding the shard further into his ankle but it didn\u2019t matter because he couldn\u2019t breathe, he needed to breathe, needed to breathe, <i>needed to the breathe.</i></p><p>Eventually Peter\u2019s movements began to slow down, his grip on the object going slack as he subconsciously focused all attention on not taking a breath. His chest rose and fell as his body\u2019s instincts took over, not caring whether he would breathe in water or not. But Peter refused to open his mouth, he couldn\u2019t. For Ned, for MJ, for Happy and Tony and May.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter\u2019s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</p><p>But he kept fading.</p><p>Even when a set of burly arms somehow detached his ankle from the glass, wrapping around his middle and pulling him towards the surface he continued to evanesce. Distantly he registered them getting closer to the evening sunlight, closer to air that he could safely breathe in.</p><p>But he had held it for so long. He couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. His mind was slipping, his vision was dissolving into nothingness and he no longer had control.</p><p>Water filled his lungs.</p><p>He took a breath.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cChill out, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whipped around, staring Sam Wilson down with a death glare that could intimidate even the most hardened criminals. \u201c<i>\u2018Chill out\u2019</i>?\u201d Tony fumed, taking a step towards him. Rhodey set his drink down at the bar and made his way towards the scene. \u201cThey were supposed to be here an hour and a half ago. Neither of them are returning my calls, I can\u2019t track their phones or the car they took, and you expect me to chill out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTones, hey,\u201d Rhodes crossed a hand over his friend\u2019s chest, guiding him away from where Sam had a hand placed threateningly over his wristwatch. The man appeared a moment away from summoning Redwing and Tony a second away from calling a suit. This definitely wasn\u2019t the vibe they had aimed for when planning a team bonding party. \u201cStand down. Starting a fight with Wilson won\u2019t help anyone,\u201d Tony grumbled, relaxing his fists and turning the other way to follow Rhodey to the bar. \u201cI\u2019m sure they just got stuck in a traffic jam. Happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took that into account, Rhodes,\u201d He politely declined a drink from the bartender and leaned against the counter, \u201cEven with traffic they should have been here a long time ago,\u201d the man picked up a generous amount of pecan cheese wafers from a platter and scarfed them down. Stress eating wouldn\u2019t help anyone either but hey, old habits die hard. Rhodes began to say something again but Tony tuned him out, staring at the double doors as if Happy would come stumbling through them with Peter safely in arms any second.</p><p>And they did.</p><p>Well, minus the \u2018safely\u2019 part.</p><p>The pair burst through the doors, startling everybody on the team so effectively they all went into their respective fighting stances. Happy and Peter were drenched head-to-toe, the older man out of breath, completely supporting the younger one who seemed to barely be breathing at all. In a blur, Tony sprinted towards the two as the head of security halfheartedly plopped Peter onto the ground. The boy stayed down, not moving an inch even when Tony appeared by his side.</p><p>\u201cHap, what the hell happened?\u201d Tony yelled, taking Peter\u2019s head in his lap. There was a half-healed gash at his temple and the boy\u2019s eyes were closed. His mouth was parted and skin white as a sheet, breathing gravelly and short. \u201cBruce, get your ass over here! Friday, prep the med team,\u201d the billionaire ordered. Banner appeared on the other side of Peter less than a second later, assessing him as best he could. Tony was now focused on the hideous wound in the kid\u2019s ankle that was bleeding profusely, and the man wondered how long it had been since he\u2019d sustained the injury. How much blood had he lost? How did he get a cut like that? Why were they so wet, and why did Peter\u2019s breathing sound like his throat had been put through a meat grinder? Seeing as the teen was unconscious the only person who could answer these question was Happy, whom Rhodey was surveying.</p><p>Tony jumped up, hesitant to leave Peter\u2019s side but trusting Bruce to take care of him and desperate to know what the hell happened. Rhodes seemed to have sat Happy down in a nearby chair, the man staring straight ahead with a frightfully bloody nose Tony previously failed to notice. The colonel was quietly coaxing him as the billionaire approached.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unresponsive,\u201d Rhodes said before Tony got the chance to speak. \u201cEither someone drugged him or he\u2019s got one hell of a concussion.\u201d</p><p>By now the rest of the team had gathered around the scene, some doing what they could to help, others not sure what that was and just watching. Wilson and a few others had already raced up to the Med Bay to help the nursing staff since most were off because of the party and Bruce was continuing to look over Peter with the assistance of Rogers. Tony would be lying if the idea of Steve being there instead of him didn\u2019t make him feel a surge of protectiveness and hostility, but logically he knew he was only helping and if Tony wanted to do the same he needed to get answers.</p><p>\u201cUnresponsive?\u201d Tony questioned rhetorically. \u201cHap, come on. What happened? Why do you two look like you just took a cat dive into the Hudson?\u201d The man didn\u2019t answer, staring straight through Tony. The man would\u2019ve kept trying but Bruce\u2019s next words sent ice through the man\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got water in his lungs!\u201d He shouted, \u201cWe need to get him to the Med Bay, <i>now!</i>\u201d</p><p>All thoughts of questioning Happy were wiped from Tony\u2019s mind. The next few minutes were a complete blur. Steve and T\u2019Challa helped carefully but quickly carry Peter down to the medical ward until the nurses met them halfway with a pair of stretchers. Nat and Rhodes handed Happy off, two nurses helping him while the rest focused on Peter, hooking the boy up to wires and checking his vitals as they wheeled him into a room.</p><p>\u201cPrep him for thoracentesis,\u201d Bruce instructed. Tony didn\u2019t have any clue as to what that procedure was but judging by the size of the needle a nurse he knew by the name of Zenia whipped out, it was nothing good.</p><p>\u201cWoah\u2014 Jesus, Bruce, what the hell\u2014?\u201d Tony began to ramble but was cut off by Banner\u2019s hand. He was highly focused as he typically was while working and hated distractions, but this was his kid and Tony demanded to know what was going on and what they were about to do to him. Bruce sighed before looking him in the eye and giving him a rundown.</p><p>\u201cPeter has water in his lungs. We aren\u2019t sure how much but we need to get it out and the only way to do that quickly and efficiently is by inserting a needle into the thorax and draining it from there into a bag. He\u2019s sustained other injuries but none are life-threatening and if we don\u2019t clear his lungs we could be facing organ failure because his blood isn\u2019t being properly oxygenated,\u201d he spoke carefully as the nurses worked together to lift Peter into a sitting position, remove his dampened sweater and lean him against the over-bed table so his back was bent and exposed. His skin was ghostly pale and the way his torso just barely rose and fell made Tony sick. Bile rose in his throat at the sight and he turned away before it could make him vomit. The man still didn\u2019t know what happened, but after the stunt that lowlife pulled with Pepper he had a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with the accords. If he was right and Peter suffered because of that\u2026</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Bruce spoke softly, slipping latex gloves on. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the best medical team on the East Coast. Let us do our job, alright? He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Tony prayed he was right.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>If there was one thing Tony never wanted to witness again, it was a goddamn thoracentesis. Maybe it was the fact that it was being performed on Peter of all people, but sickening squelch of the syringe puncturing his lung was unexpected and completely revolting. If that wasn\u2019t enough, watching murky fluid leak out of his body through a tube and into a waiting plastic bag was almost just as bad. The amount of water was more than they\u2019d anticipated, calling for them to switch out the collection pouch once for each lung. The procedure as a whole didn\u2019t take very long but it was borderline traumatizing for Tony nonetheless, he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the image of the kid bent over the table with two needles poking into his lungs out of his head for days to come. He\u2019d never been so grateful the teen was unconscious.</p><p>Tony guessed Rhodes or Friday had called May because not long after it was over the woman was bursting through the doors of the room and jogging towards her unconscious nephew. Joining Tony\u2019s side the woman, who was still clad in her own nursing scrubs, held her hand up to her mouth and let out a soft gasp.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what did they do to you?\u201d She whispered, clearly wanting nothing more than to comfort him but stayed put, knowing better than anyone that Bruce and the nurses needed to do their jobs.</p><p>A few of Peter\u2019s knuckles were fractured on each hand and fifteen minutes were spent painstakingly picking glass shards from the cuts on both, a clear indication that there was a struggle. The gash on his ankle looked like a stab wound but upon closer inspection was too sloppy and torn much too awkwardly to have been caused by a knife. The best they could do was treat it and wait until he or Happy woke up to ask what happened.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t for another hour and a half when they completed dressing Peter\u2019s injuries and treating Happy that the older man finally became coherent and responsive. Bruce was called into the room and Tony followed, knowing Peter was in safe enough hands with his aunt.</p><p>They entered Happy\u2019s room across the hall, the billionaire very surprised to see him already sitting up and talking to the nurse.</p><p>\u201cIs the kid okay?\u201d Happy was asking repeatedly. The nurse opened her mouth to respond but when the bodyguard caught sight of Tony and Bruce he completely disregarded her, almost jumping out of bed. The two men pushed him back down delicately, reprimanding him for being so careless.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Hap, do you have a death wish?\u201d Tony said. The man had his head bandaged, nose also wrapped as it had been severely broken. Getting up so fast was a sure-fire way to collapse and hit his already fractured skull on the ground.</p><p>\u201cPeter, is he\u2014? I tried to\u2014 but they were\u2014 I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he stumbled over his words, looking on the verge of tears. It caught Tony off guard. He\u2019d never seen the man so vulnerable and emotional.</p><p>\u201cPeter will be fine,\u201d Bruce cut in. Happy sagged with relief, closing his eyes and sinking into the sheets. \u201cHappy, can you tell us what happened?\u201d The doctor asked gently.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Happy muttered under his breath, vigorously rubbing his face before meeting Tony\u2019s eyes with the most undeniably apologetic look he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cWe were on our way to the tower,\u201d he started, looking down. \u201cWe were stuck in traffic, stopped beside an alleyway. They came up and threw some kind of gas in. I got out before breathing it all in but Peter was already out cold in the backseat. They dragged me into the alley and\u2014\u201c he stopped, eyebrows furrowing as he concentrated on trying to remember the following events. \u201cI guess they hit my head pretty hard. Everything else is there in bits and pieces. I remember they took the car, they disabled the tracking device and tossed out his phone but the kid had those spider tracer doohickies in his bag. I think I used those to find him. I\u2019m not so sure how I got there, but I know that they brought him to the docks and drove the car into the water with\u2014 with Peter in it,\u201d Tony grit his teeth. <i>Oh</i>. \u201cI knocked those bastard\u2019s out and dove after him. Everything else up until ten minutes ago is gone. I dunno why I didn\u2019t call for backup, I\u2019m so sorry, Tony. It should have never happened in the\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Tony said, placing a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou did just fine, Hap. The kid\u2019s alive and he\u2019s going to be okay, all thanks to you. It\u2019s not your fault some lunatics went after Peter.\u201c</p><p>\u201cExactly. And with the damage done to your head, it\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re conscious now, much less able to accomplish all that. When you came in it was like you were in a trance, your brain must have been focused on getting Peter to the safest place possible, which is here,\u201d Bruce nodded, squeezing his shoulder in reassurance. \u201cLike Tony said, you did a fantastic job. Now <i>rest</i>. Let your body recover. And don\u2019t make me sedate you,\u201d he warned, pointing a finger at the bodyguard. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Happy raised in hands in defense, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, doc. I think I could sleep for the next century.\u201d</p><p>With that problem settled, Tony returned to Peter\u2019s side and got started on the next one\u2014 apprehending the numbskulls who caused this problem in the first place. The billionaire tracked down the car just as Happy had, locating the spider-tracers with ease. He notified the authorities and Rhodey suited up to deal with any <i>problems</i> they may encounter and, as May put it, give them \u201ca good clobbering\u201d. Not too long after leaving the tower Tony was notified that the two men were in custody and if the bruised and bloody mugshots were anything to go by, Rhodes kept up on his promise. Apparently they had some vendetta against Cap and his entourage, but as long as the two were no longer a threat Tony couldn\u2019t give two shits what their reasoning was. There was no excuse for kidnapping a child, especially one as innocent and undeserving as Peter.</p><p>Speaking of, the kid didn\u2019t wake up until early the next morning. Four, to be exact, but it wasn\u2019t like anyone got much sleep anyways. It was fairly touch-and-go all night since they could only estimate how long Peter was breathing with liquid in his lungs, so the extent of damage was TBD. His organs were working fine however if his blood wasn\u2019t sufficiently oxygenated, there was a high chance of brain damage and it was almost impossible to tell while unconscious. So when he woke up so soon, it was a major relief for everybody.</p><p>The boy awoke and immediately tensed up, only relaxing when his eyes landed on May and Tony. He squeezed his eyes shut and winced in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling, bud?\u201d Tony asked, pressing the call button. May smiled down at her nephew, running her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cMy chest feels like it got rammed by a truck,\u201d he croaked. Tony and May both grimaced at the teen\u2019s voice. It was hellishly thick and raspy, somewhat reminding the billionaire of how he sounded following the abysmal waterboarding in Afghanistan. The man shook the thought from his head before his mind got lost in that dark place, but the comparison struck sorrow into his heart. The thought of Peter going through something as dreadful and vile as drowning sickened the man.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s expected,\u201d Bruce announced as he entered the room, accompanied by nurse Zenia. \u201cDo you feel any abnormalities outside of the discomfort?\u201d He asked, suddenly leaning over him and shining a penlight in the teen\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWoah, Doctor Banner, I\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you dizzy? Trouble breathing? Any pain? Can you tell me your full name and date of birth?\u201d Peter obliged, but seemed very uncomfortable at being poked and prodded so promptly after awakening. \u201cOpen,\u201d Bruce commanded, sticking a thermometer under the boy\u2019s tongue. While he waited and Zenia took his pulse and blood pressure at the same time, Pete glanced over at his aunt with narrowed eyes. She in turn looked up at Tony, a silent exchange that told him to get Banner to lay off.</p><p>\u201cBruce, could we just\u2014 give him a little space, please?\u201d Tony spoke. The thermometer beeped and though the doctor looked less than satisfied, but nevertheless nodded at Zenia who gathered the vitals cart and wheeled it out. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the first time Mr. Stark has told somebody to <i>stop</i> fussing over me,\u201d Peter remarked. Tony rolled his eyes, however felt very much relieved now that Pete was cracking jokes.</p><p>\u201cSo, no brain damage then?\u201d May asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t appear to be,\u201d Bruce responded, removing his glasses. \u201cDo you want to ask him some questions, Tony?\u201d</p><p>The billionaire sighed, grabbing hold of Peter\u2019s hand. The teen\u2019s skin was still ice-cold and the man felt a sudden urge to wrap him in every blanket the tower owned. \u201cWhat do you remember about the attack, Pete?\u201d</p><p>The small grin the boy had disappeared from his face and his eyes downcast, grip on Tony\u2019s fingers tightening ever-so-slightly as he seemed to recall the events of the previous night. He opened his mouth once before clamping it shut again, repeating that action three times before finally speaking.</p><p>\u201cWe were on our way to the party,\u201d he said, eyes trained on the tube that led to his nasal cannula. \u201cMy spider-sense was ringing like crazy, but I figured it was just nerves. Then somebody cracked a crowbar into the side of my head and threw these gas thingies in. I blacked out after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Bruce urged.</p><p>\u201cI woke up in the back on the car handcuffed to the handlebar on the ceiling. There was a Russian man and some guy with a ski-mask on. The Russian one asked me why Mr. Rogers and his friends were pardoned, but he didn\u2019t believe me when I told him no and\u2014 and set the car to drive into the river,\u201d May squeezed Peter\u2019s wrist reassuringly when he hesitated. \u201cUm, they kept asking through a speaker while the water was filling up the car through holes they must\u2019ve drilled before I woke up. Eventually they believed me but it was already up to my chin and they just\u2014 <i>left</i> me there. I started punching the glass,\u201d he glanced over his bandaged knuckles, taking in a long, deep breath as if the room would fill with water any second. \u201cBut they\u2019re bulletproof and the water had filled the car so it was even harder. I\u2014 I kept going even when it hurt but it got so hard to hold my breath and oh my god, May, I thought I was going to <i>die</i> down there,\u201d a few tears pricked at the boy\u2019s eyes but he pushed them back, squeezing his eyes shut as his aunt engulfed him in a hug. Tony very gently clasped his hand a little tighter as he continued to recount the story into May\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of you guys kept me going. I broke the window but I guess a piece of glass was still stuck in the framing because it caught on my ankle and trapped me there. I couldn\u2019t get it out and started to black out but\u2014 somebody saved me? Was it\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy,\u201d Tony finished. \u201cHe brought you here. Crashed our party. Which was going <i>egregiously</i> without you, might I add.\u201d</p><p>May pulled away and Peter let out a small giggle. Tony loved and hated it because it filled him with love and affection but at the same time reminded the man of just how small and young the boy was. Those men had just left him there to drown. God, as soon as he could Tony swore he would fly straight to whatever station they were being held at and deliver a beating twice that of Rhodey\u2019s.</p><p>But for now the kid needed him, and he wouldn\u2019t leave his side until he was bouncing off the walls, rambling on about the newest version of web fluid he\u2019d brainstormed or latest news on the upcoming Star Wars film.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Peter asked after Bruce completed all the required tests and they\u2019d settled in with some oh-so-tasty ice chips. \u201cWhy <i>was</i> Mr. Rogers pardoned?\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed. All this trouble for something so small and insignificant. The UN was planning on announcing everything in the coming days but for some bullshit legal reasons and to \u201cprevent panic\u201d they couldn\u2019t tell the public that. Clearly, it only caused further hysteria and drove people to attempt to kidnap and succeed in kidnapping Stark Industries personnel. Tony would be having a lengthy word with whoever\u2019s idea it was to hold off on sharing the information, legalities be damned.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t hurt to tell the kid now, would it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026\u201d</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p><i>Summary: Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter\u2019s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</i></p><p><i>But he kept fading.</i></p><p><b>{warnings: drowning, graphic depictions of medical procedures}</b></p><p>The people the media had dubbed as the <i>\u2018Rogue Avengers\u2019</i> were recently pardoned for reasons largely unknown. Not even Peter knew why, though upon questioning Tony about it the man tensed up prompting the teen to back off. He supposed it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and if the general public weren\u2019t told why there\u2019s no reason he should\u2019ve been any different. However, now that they were all officially part of a team again, Pepper and T\u2019Challa decided the previously divided group needed to start having so-called bonding sessions. The awkwardness and tension between everybody was impossible to ignore, or so Tony and Rhodey told Peter one night during a lab session. Pepper said that it couldn\u2019t continue if they were to function normally on missions or in the battlefield, so she and (reluctantly) Tony organized a party set at the tower in typical Stark fashion.</p><p>To say Peter was nervous would be the understatement of the century.</p>[[MORE]]<p>When expressing his concern to May, she comforted him yet noted that he should turn those nerves into excitement. After all, it\u2019s not every day you get to hang out with the <i>Avengers</i>. Of course she was right, and of course he was excited but that anticipation was a mere speck compared to the storm of anxiety swirling in the pool of his gut. What if he did something stupid? Said something embarrassing? What if they kicked him out because he was a kid or didn\u2019t fit their standards of being a true hero.</p><p><i>What if they didn\u2019t like him?</i></p><p>Some of those thoughts may have been irrational\u2014 He\u2019s sure Tony wouldn\u2019t let the teen leave his sight\u2014 but they filled Peter\u2019s mind nonetheless. He didn\u2019t even really want to go to the gathering, but his mentor insisted, saying that despite him turning down an official spot on the Avengers he was still as much a part of the team as everyone else and the other members would need to get used to him being around. Peter guessed Tony was right and agreed, also deciding it better than to mention the fact that he knew the billionaire largely wanted Pete there to keep him grounded as well as a source of comfort. But that went unspoken.</p><p>So here Peter and Happy sat, stuck in a sea of Manhattan traffic. His Spidey-Senses were off the charts but he figured it was just because of the claustrophobia that came with being stuck amidst a swarm of dozens of cars that finally caused his pent up anxiety to come loose.</p><p>Happy honked and let out a colorful bout of curses due to some jerk in front of them who had carelessly swerved into the wrong lane at the wrong time and almost caused a pile-up. Aggressively rolling down the window and sticking his head out he shouted, \u201cLearn to use your turn signal, asshole!\u201d</p><p>All the while, Peter was trying to keep down the cafeteria made pizza he\u2019d had for lunch just hours prior. In an <i>hour </i>they\u2019d only managed to go three blocks. All this time sitting back against leather seating ensured his brain conjured up every possible embarrassing situation that could play out. That is, if they ever <i>got </i>to the damn party.</p><p>The teenager sighed as Happy slouched back into the driver\u2019s seat, grumbling to himself. Pete rested his elbow against the edge of the window and set his jaw into his palm, subconsciously bouncing his leg up and down so fast that Happy needed to tell the boy to stop as it was shaking the entire vehicle. Over the course of the next ten minutes he continued to change positions, shifting from one to the next in a desperate attempt to find one that would somehow calm him and ease the buzzing in the nape of his neck that was growing more irritating and impossible to ignore by the minute.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just swing to the tower?\u201d He finally asked before unbuckling his seatbelt, stretching his legs across the three back seats of the car, deciding that position made everything <i>much</i> worse, and ultimately going back to a normal position again. Happy straightened before answering.</p><p>\u201cBoss has strict orders that I not let you out of my sight until we get to the tower,\u201d he adjusted the mirror to get a better view of Peter who was now biting his fingernails. \u201cBesides, last I knew Tony\u2019s still fixing up your suit from when you decided it was a good idea to take on a lunatic who could spit fire all by yourself,\u201d Happy remarked. Peter sighed, eyeing the compartment in his backpack where his web-shooters were stashed.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve gone out without the mask,\u201d he mumbled, rolling down the window to breathe in some fresh air. A little girl skipped by with an Iron Man balloon. \u201cPlus, I have superpowers. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>Peter could practically feel the eye roll radiating off Happy. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to bother telling you how stupid swinging around New York without your mask on is because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, but,\u201d he gripped the steering wheel a little harder. \u201cYou know how people have been about the pardoning. Just this morning some nut job tried to pull Pepper into his car to get information out of her.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart wrenched with concern. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little shaken, but fine. What I\u2019m saying is, if anybody thinks you know anything because of your internship, you could be at real risk and Tony\u2019s going to go to any lengths possible to prevent that. As am I,\u201d The car moved a few feet forward before lurching to a stop again, an echo of honks reverberating throughout the avenue. \u201cSo if we have to sit here for another hour, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Peter appreciated their concern, he really did. And he knew that Happy wasn\u2019t one to express such feelings so openly and this was a serious situation but god, his spidey-sense was going haywire and everything was becoming too much too much too<i> much\u2014</i></p><p>So when a gloved hand smashed a crowbar into his temple through the window and a previously activated smoke grenade was tossed into the car, Peter couldn\u2019t exactly say he was surprised.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Peter opened his eyes to his worn sneakers planted firmly on the familiarly pristine carpet of Happy\u2019s black Sedan. The teen felt groggy, much like the time he woke up in the med bay after getting shot in his abdomen by some street thug trying to rob Sub Haven. His head was fuzzy and it took him a moment or two to realize the awkward position he was situated in\u2014 Zip tied to the chicken handle screwed to the roof of the car. His arms were hanging above him, bent ever-so-slightly and his head was hanging forward just short of resting against the front passenger\u2019s seat. Peter let out a quiet groan, lifting his head while he attempted to gather his bearings. He was in the same spot he was in when whoever it was hit him with that crowbar\u2014</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His eyes snapped open, the boy now painfully aware of his surroundings. The car was nowhere near East 34th Street, instead parked by the docks of some old warehouse. The side of his head throbbed awfully as he turned his head to the left only to come face-to-face with a middle-aged man in a black hoodie grinning maliciously back. Peter started and backed up as far as he could against the door to put as much distance between himself and this cigar-smelling creep. One other man accompanied them in the car and was wearing a red ski mask, sat in the front seat while staring out at the sunset as if they hadn\u2019t just kidnapped a sixteen-year-old kid.</p><p>\u201cPeter Parker,\u201d The man said casually with a Russian accent. \u201cI heard you\u2019re close with Stark, yes?\u201d</p><p>Peter said nothing in response, only staring back with what he hoped were hard eyes. Showing fear and weakness would only prove to this man that he\u2019d already gotten underneath Peter\u2019s skin, and vulnerability was the last thing he needed. If Pete had any chance of outsmarting this guy and escaping unscathed he needed at least some remnants of the upper hand.</p><p>The sun was only just beginning to disappear over the horizon so it couldn\u2019t have been long, which could be either a good or bad thing. They weren\u2019t far from the city but it was too soon for anybody to have noticed their absence if word hadn\u2019t gotten out already. Peter was unconscious before he could see whether or not these men made a scene of their kidnapping or did it as discreetly as they could, so either Iron Man was searching the skies and would be blasting these men into the Hudson within minutes, or Mr. Stark was waiting insouciantly for their arrival at the tower. Peter clenched his fists hard, just short of breaking skin. He was suddenly very aware of how uncomfortable having your arms hung above your head for so long was if the first twinges of muscle cramps were anything to go by.</p><p>When Peter still didn\u2019t answer, the man sighed and picked up the crowbar from where it was set on the floor. Peter tensed as his kidnapper gripped the jagged end firmly, jabbing the rounded steel into his stomach. The boy wheezed and made an attempt to further back into the door, but was met with little success.</p><p>\u201cWhen I ask a question,\u201d he flipped his hold on the crowbar and prodded the pigfoot along the teen\u2019s bobbing throat where he was still struggling to draw in a proper breath. \u201cYou answer. Capiche?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded and the man placed the tool gently into his lap, though it did little to relax the teen. He then leaned back casually against the opposite door with an unreadable expression plastered across his face, running his thumb against the polyester seatbelt absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re close with Stark?\u201d He asked again. Peter swallowed the lump in his throat, finally having recovered from the violent blow before answering.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d it came out less shaky than he thought it would, and the boy felt a mini-surge of confidence. \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>His abductor huffed a laugh at his nerve before sitting up straight and tipping forwards again. He clasped his hands together, staring at them for a moment before looking directly at Peter. \u201cI want to know why that scum was pardoned.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped. God, Happy was right. Happy was right and Peter didn\u2019t take him seriously and now he was zip tied in the back of a car with two strangers who probably had every intention of hurting him for this information. He should be by Tony\u2019s side right now, laughing off awkward conversations with unfamiliar members of the team but instead he was being threatened by some crazy Russian dude and his eerily silent friend.</p><p>Peter shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d The man shrieked, making Peter flinch. \u201cI am not interested in being here for long. I am not interested in hurting you. Just tell me what I want and I will release you,\u201d his voice got lower, \u201cbut I <i>will</i> do what I have to in order to get what I am looking for. Easy or hard way, you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m just an intern. I\u2019m not cleared to receive that kind of information!\u201d He reasoned. The man only grew more irritated, twisting his body to unlock the door. He shoved it open with a grunt and motioned for his accomplice to do the same, muttering a quick word that Peter didn\u2019t quite pick up on.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he announced, slamming the door while the ski mask-clad man shifted the gears and fiddled with the gas below the steering wheel. \u201cHard way it is.\u201d His accomplice appeared to finish whatever he was setting up and glanced over his shoulder at the Russian man who gave a nod. He yanked something harshly, took several swift steps backward, and the tires began screeching. The car remained in place for a moment as it struggled to gain traction and once it did the car sped forward, momentum pushing Peter up against the back of the seat as the vehicle rolled off of the dock and into the river below.</p><p>For a second Peter did nothing, shock and confusion clouding his thinking. But then the car began to sink faster than it should have as water poured into the car through wide holes drilled into the floor beneath the seats that Peter had failed to notice beforehand and he began to panic. Within seconds the car was already submerged halfway under the surface and the water pooling in the car reached Pete\u2019s ankles.</p><p>\u201cRethink your decision, Peter,\u201d The man\u2019s voice sounded through a mini-speaker that was haphazardly taped to the ceiling of the car just short of the windshield. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly rescue you, but only if I get what I want.\u201d</p><p>Peter clenched his fists in annoyance and fright, \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything!\u201d</p><p>The teen\u2019s breathing began to pick up and he desperately tried to keep it under control as the car was now fully submerged. He didn\u2019t want to waste the limited air supply he may have and spiraling into a full-blown panic attack definitely wouldn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cGive me an answer,\u201d the criminal said firmly. \u201cThe car\u2019s filling up quick, is it not?\u201d Peter clenched his jaw because yes, it absolutely was. It was pooling above his knees and creeping up towards his abdomen. At this rate he\u2019d be completely under in less than a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe me, they didn\u2019t tell me anything!\u201d He shouted, mind scrambling for something he could say to get him out of this. \u201cI\u2014 I can get it for you!\u201d He tried. \u201cI was on my way to see him earlier, just let me see Mr. Stark and I\u2019ll convince him to tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can get him to swaddle you with protection? So you can rat me out? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he spoke. The ice-cold water lapped just below Peter\u2019s neck, and he snapped the cuffs apart without care. There weren\u2019t any camera\u2019s visible and he needed to get out. \u201cLast chance, <i>\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a</i>,\u201d he spat. \u201cWhy where they pardoned?\u201d</p><p>Peter began slamming the window as hard as he could, his final response punctuated with each punch to the glass, \u201cI. Don\u2019t. <i>Know!</i>\u201d The liquid that now came to his chin was substantially hindering the force of his hits, not to mention the fact the Tony had modified the windows to be <i>bulletproof</i> didn\u2019t help his case. But he kept going regardless, striking the pane with all his might.</p><p>While doing so the boy distantly heard the two men conversing over the speaker before the Russian man announced, \u201cI believe you. In that case, I have no further use for you,\u201d Peter\u2019s heart dropped.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. The teen now had to tilt his head upwards to keep it above the surface of the water, his forehead resting against the ceiling of the car. \u201cNo! Come back!\u201d He pleaded. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave me here!\u201d But it was useless. He was soaked head-to-toe and was about to drown if he didn\u2019t break this damned glass. So he squeezed his eyes shut, took in the deepest breath he could muster, and allowed the water to engulf him.</p><p>The silence that followed was excruciating. Compared to the fast-paced sound of water rushing in, his panicked huffing filling the air, and the crackling of his abductor\u2019s voice over that speaker, the complete and utter lack of noise was disturbing.</p><p>People always said drowning was the most peaceful way to go. Peter never understood that statement. He had never drowned, but it looked anything but peaceful and judging by the ache of his lungs that were screaming at him to take a breath, his inevitable demise would be agonizing. It was only then that he understood what they were talking about\u2014 the peacefulness was breathtaking (What an ironic choice of words, Peter thought bitterly). It wasn\u2019t that he was at peace because God, was he far from it, however even as his mind scrambled and fell apart in his struggle to survive it was oddly\u2026 serene.</p><p>Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad way to go.</p><p>The boy quickly shook that thought from his head, berating himself for almost giving up so quickly. How could he say that? How could he have thought of leaving everything behind, even for a second? Peter had his whole life ahead of him. Who would build LEGO sets with Ned, answer all the physics questions during decathlon meets? Tony wouldn\u2019t handle his loss well, the man\u2019s liver would probably give out as he tried to drink away the guilt. And God, <i>May</i>. She\u2019s lost everything and Peter would be damned if that woman had to lose him too.</p><p>Peter suddenly felt a surge of anger, at himself, at the men who took him, the rogue avengers, the government, at Mr. Stark for making this fucking glass so assuredly impenetrable. He hit harder than before, not caring that his knuckles had split open and stained the water a murky crimson.</p><p><i>Come on</i>, he thought. <i>Break. Break. Break!</i></p><p>Just as the teen\u2019s strength began wearing thin and his hope began to dwindle once again, the smallest of cracks appeared where the window was slightly smeared with blood. His lungs and muscles burned like hell but he wasn\u2019t going to give up now. Peter grit his teeth and drove his fist into the pane again. He never thought the sound of glass giving in could be so sweet.</p><p>The fractures in the pane spread further, resembling a spider\u2019s web more and more with each hit. Just a few more, he was almost there and\u2014</p><p>Peter\u2019s fist smashed through the window and the shards scattered into the liquid around him, a few pieces getting caught in his knuckles. But the teen didn\u2019t notice and he pushed himself through the opening as hard as he could, longing for the surface that seemed so close yet so far. In his desperation, Peter didn\u2019t spot the pointed, jagged edges of broken glass that remained attached to the frame of the window. It wasn\u2019t until he came to an abrupt halt that he looked down and pain overcame him in a harrowing wave.</p><p>One of the remaining shards had caught onto the boy\u2019s pant leg, slicing through the fabric and into the skin of his ankle. It dug into him like a fishing hook, anchoring him to the car. Peter couldn\u2019t help but let out a shout of pain, eyes going wide and mouth snapping shut when he realized that <i>shit</i>, that was all of his air. Suddenly the pain in his ankle didn\u2019t seem so bad as his lungs started to spasm with the need for air the sudden absence of it. Peter bent down, pulling at the glass shard itself because it was stuck into him at too awkward of an angle for him to take it out on his own. The glass needed to come with him, but damn this reinforced car because it wasn\u2019t coming loose. He was thrashing now as his muscles and mind went into one final fit of hysteria in a last-ditch attempt to get free. Little did Peter know that by doing so he was only embedding the shard further into his ankle but it didn\u2019t matter because he couldn\u2019t breathe, he needed to breathe, needed to breathe, <i>needed to the breathe.</i></p><p>Eventually Peter\u2019s movements began to slow down, his grip on the object going slack as he subconsciously focused all attention on not taking a breath. His chest rose and fell as his body\u2019s instincts took over, not caring whether he would breathe in water or not. But Peter refused to open his mouth, he couldn\u2019t. For Ned, for MJ, for Happy and Tony and May.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter\u2019s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</p><p>But he kept fading.</p><p>Even when a set of burly arms somehow detached his ankle from the glass, wrapping around his middle and pulling him towards the surface he continued to evanesce. Distantly he registered them getting closer to the evening sunlight, closer to air that he could safely breathe in.</p><p>But he had held it for so long. He couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. His mind was slipping, his vision was dissolving into nothingness and he no longer had control.</p><p>Water filled his lungs.</p><p>He took a breath.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cChill out, Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony whipped around, staring Sam Wilson down with a death glare that could intimidate even the most hardened criminals. \u201c<i>\u2018Chill out\u2019</i>?\u201d Tony fumed, taking a step towards him. Rhodey set his drink down at the bar and made his way towards the scene. \u201cThey were supposed to be here an hour and a half ago. Neither of them are returning my calls, I can\u2019t track their phones or the car they took, and you expect me to chill out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTones, hey,\u201d Rhodes crossed a hand over his friend\u2019s chest, guiding him away from where Sam had a hand placed threateningly over his wristwatch. The man appeared a moment away from summoning Redwing and Tony a second away from calling a suit. This definitely wasn\u2019t the vibe they had aimed for when planning a team bonding party. \u201cStand down. Starting a fight with Wilson won\u2019t help anyone,\u201d Tony grumbled, relaxing his fists and turning the other way to follow Rhodey to the bar. \u201cI\u2019m sure they just got stuck in a traffic jam. Happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took that into account, Rhodes,\u201d He politely declined a drink from the bartender and leaned against the counter, \u201cEven with traffic they should have been here a long time ago,\u201d the man picked up a generous amount of pecan cheese wafers from a platter and scarfed them down. Stress eating wouldn\u2019t help anyone either but hey, old habits die hard. Rhodes began to say something again but Tony tuned him out, staring at the double doors as if Happy would come stumbling through them with Peter safely in arms any second.</p><p>And they did.</p><p>Well, minus the \u2018safely\u2019 part.</p><p>The pair burst through the doors, startling everybody on the team so effectively they all went into their respective fighting stances. Happy and Peter were drenched head-to-toe, the older man out of breath, completely supporting the younger one who seemed to barely be breathing at all. In a blur, Tony sprinted towards the two as the head of security halfheartedly plopped Peter onto the ground. The boy stayed down, not moving an inch even when Tony appeared by his side.</p><p>\u201cHap, what the hell happened?\u201d Tony yelled, taking Peter\u2019s head in his lap. There was a half-healed gash at his temple and the boy\u2019s eyes were closed. His mouth was parted and skin white as a sheet, breathing gravelly and short. \u201cBruce, get your ass over here! Friday, prep the med team,\u201d the billionaire ordered. Banner appeared on the other side of Peter less than a second later, assessing him as best he could. Tony was now focused on the hideous wound in the kid\u2019s ankle that was bleeding profusely, and the man wondered how long it had been since he\u2019d sustained the injury. How much blood had he lost? How did he get a cut like that? Why were they so wet, and why did Peter\u2019s breathing sound like his throat had been put through a meat grinder? Seeing as the teen was unconscious the only person who could answer these question was Happy, whom Rhodey was surveying.</p><p>Tony jumped up, hesitant to leave Peter\u2019s side but trusting Bruce to take care of him and desperate to know what the hell happened. Rhodes seemed to have sat Happy down in a nearby chair, the man staring straight ahead with a frightfully bloody nose Tony previously failed to notice. The colonel was quietly coaxing him as the billionaire approached.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unresponsive,\u201d Rhodes said before Tony got the chance to speak. \u201cEither someone drugged him or he\u2019s got one hell of a concussion.\u201d</p><p>By now the rest of the team had gathered around the scene, some doing what they could to help, others not sure what that was and just watching. Wilson and a few others had already raced up to the Med Bay to help the nursing staff since most were off because of the party and Bruce was continuing to look over Peter with the assistance of Rogers. Tony would be lying if the idea of Steve being there instead of him didn\u2019t make him feel a surge of protectiveness and hostility, but logically he knew he was only helping and if Tony wanted to do the same he needed to get answers.</p><p>\u201cUnresponsive?\u201d Tony questioned rhetorically. \u201cHap, come on. What happened? Why do you two look like you just took a cat dive into the Hudson?\u201d The man didn\u2019t answer, staring straight through Tony. The man would\u2019ve kept trying but Bruce\u2019s next words sent ice through the man\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got water in his lungs!\u201d He shouted, \u201cWe need to get him to the Med Bay, <i>now!</i>\u201d</p><p>All thoughts of questioning Happy were wiped from Tony\u2019s mind. The next few minutes were a complete blur. Steve and T\u2019Challa helped carefully but quickly carry Peter down to the medical ward until the nurses met them halfway with a pair of stretchers. Nat and Rhodes handed Happy off, two nurses helping him while the rest focused on Peter, hooking the boy up to wires and checking his vitals as they wheeled him into a room.</p><p>\u201cPrep him for thoracentesis,\u201d Bruce instructed. Tony didn\u2019t have any clue as to what that procedure was but judging by the size of the needle a nurse he knew by the name of Zenia whipped out, it was nothing good.</p><p>\u201cWoah\u2014 Jesus, Bruce, what the hell\u2014?\u201d Tony began to ramble but was cut off by Banner\u2019s hand. He was highly focused as he typically was while working and hated distractions, but this was his kid and Tony demanded to know what was going on and what they were about to do to him. Bruce sighed before looking him in the eye and giving him a rundown.</p><p>\u201cPeter has water in his lungs. We aren\u2019t sure how much but we need to get it out and the only way to do that quickly and efficiently is by inserting a needle into the thorax and draining it from there into a bag. He\u2019s sustained other injuries but none are life-threatening and if we don\u2019t clear his lungs we could be facing organ failure because his blood isn\u2019t being properly oxygenated,\u201d he spoke carefully as the nurses worked together to lift Peter into a sitting position, remove his dampened sweater and lean him against the over-bed table so his back was bent and exposed. His skin was ghostly pale and the way his torso just barely rose and fell made Tony sick. Bile rose in his throat at the sight and he turned away before it could make him vomit. The man still didn\u2019t know what happened, but after the stunt that lowlife pulled with Pepper he had a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with the accords. If he was right and Peter suffered because of that\u2026</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Bruce spoke softly, slipping latex gloves on. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the best medical team on the East Coast. Let us do our job, alright? He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Tony prayed he was right.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>If there was one thing Tony never wanted to witness again, it was a goddamn thoracentesis. Maybe it was the fact that it was being performed on Peter of all people, but sickening squelch of the syringe puncturing his lung was unexpected and completely revolting. If that wasn\u2019t enough, watching murky fluid leak out of his body through a tube and into a waiting plastic bag was almost just as bad. The amount of water was more than they\u2019d anticipated, calling for them to switch out the collection pouch once for each lung. The procedure as a whole didn\u2019t take very long but it was borderline traumatizing for Tony nonetheless, he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the image of the kid bent over the table with two needles poking into his lungs out of his head for days to come. He\u2019d never been so grateful the teen was unconscious.</p><p>Tony guessed Rhodes or Friday had called May because not long after it was over the woman was bursting through the doors of the room and jogging towards her unconscious nephew. Joining Tony\u2019s side the woman, who was still clad in her own nursing scrubs, held her hand up to her mouth and let out a soft gasp.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what did they do to you?\u201d She whispered, clearly wanting nothing more than to comfort him but stayed put, knowing better than anyone that Bruce and the nurses needed to do their jobs.</p><p>A few of Peter\u2019s knuckles were fractured on each hand and fifteen minutes were spent painstakingly picking glass shards from the cuts on both, a clear indication that there was a struggle. The gash on his ankle looked like a stab wound but upon closer inspection was too sloppy and torn much too awkwardly to have been caused by a knife. The best they could do was treat it and wait until he or Happy woke up to ask what happened.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t for another hour and a half when they completed dressing Peter\u2019s injuries and treating Happy that the older man finally became coherent and responsive. Bruce was called into the room and Tony followed, knowing Peter was in safe enough hands with his aunt.</p><p>They entered Happy\u2019s room across the hall, the billionaire very surprised to see him already sitting up and talking to the nurse.</p><p>\u201cIs the kid okay?\u201d Happy was asking repeatedly. The nurse opened her mouth to respond but when the bodyguard caught sight of Tony and Bruce he completely disregarded her, almost jumping out of bed. The two men pushed him back down delicately, reprimanding him for being so careless.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Hap, do you have a death wish?\u201d Tony said. The man had his head bandaged, nose also wrapped as it had been severely broken. Getting up so fast was a sure-fire way to collapse and hit his already fractured skull on the ground.</p><p>\u201cPeter, is he\u2014? I tried to\u2014 but they were\u2014 I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he stumbled over his words, looking on the verge of tears. It caught Tony off guard. He\u2019d never seen the man so vulnerable and emotional.</p><p>\u201cPeter will be fine,\u201d Bruce cut in. Happy sagged with relief, closing his eyes and sinking into the sheets. \u201cHappy, can you tell us what happened?\u201d The doctor asked gently.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Happy muttered under his breath, vigorously rubbing his face before meeting Tony\u2019s eyes with the most undeniably apologetic look he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cWe were on our way to the tower,\u201d he started, looking down. \u201cWe were stuck in traffic, stopped beside an alleyway. They came up and threw some kind of gas in. I got out before breathing it all in but Peter was already out cold in the backseat. They dragged me into the alley and\u2014\u201c he stopped, eyebrows furrowing as he concentrated on trying to remember the following events. \u201cI guess they hit my head pretty hard. Everything else is there in bits and pieces. I remember they took the car, they disabled the tracking device and tossed out his phone but the kid had those spider tracer doohickies in his bag. I think I used those to find him. I\u2019m not so sure how I got there, but I know that they brought him to the docks and drove the car into the water with\u2014 with Peter in it,\u201d Tony grit his teeth. <i>Oh</i>. \u201cI knocked those bastard\u2019s out and dove after him. Everything else up until ten minutes ago is gone. I dunno why I didn\u2019t call for backup, I\u2019m so sorry, Tony. It should have never happened in the\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Tony said, placing a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou did just fine, Hap. The kid\u2019s alive and he\u2019s going to be okay, all thanks to you. It\u2019s not your fault some lunatics went after Peter.\u201c</p><p>\u201cExactly. And with the damage done to your head, it\u2019s a wonder you\u2019re conscious now, much less able to accomplish all that. When you came in it was like you were in a trance, your brain must have been focused on getting Peter to the safest place possible, which is here,\u201d Bruce nodded, squeezing his shoulder in reassurance. \u201cLike Tony said, you did a fantastic job. Now <i>rest</i>. Let your body recover. And don\u2019t make me sedate you,\u201d he warned, pointing a finger at the bodyguard. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Happy raised in hands in defense, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, doc. I think I could sleep for the next century.\u201d</p><p>With that problem settled, Tony returned to Peter\u2019s side and got started on the next one\u2014 apprehending the numbskulls who caused this problem in the first place. The billionaire tracked down the car just as Happy had, locating the spider-tracers with ease. He notified the authorities and Rhodey suited up to deal with any <i>problems</i> they may encounter and, as May put it, give them \u201ca good clobbering\u201d. Not too long after leaving the tower Tony was notified that the two men were in custody and if the bruised and bloody mugshots were anything to go by, Rhodes kept up on his promise. Apparently they had some vendetta against Cap and his entourage, but as long as the two were no longer a threat Tony couldn\u2019t give two shits what their reasoning was. There was no excuse for kidnapping a child, especially one as innocent and undeserving as Peter.</p><p>Speaking of, the kid didn\u2019t wake up until early the next morning. Four, to be exact, but it wasn\u2019t like anyone got much sleep anyways. It was fairly touch-and-go all night since they could only estimate how long Peter was breathing with liquid in his lungs, so the extent of damage was TBD. His organs were working fine however if his blood wasn\u2019t sufficiently oxygenated, there was a high chance of brain damage and it was almost impossible to tell while unconscious. So when he woke up so soon, it was a major relief for everybody.</p><p>The boy awoke and immediately tensed up, only relaxing when his eyes landed on May and Tony. He squeezed his eyes shut and winced in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling, bud?\u201d Tony asked, pressing the call button. May smiled down at her nephew, running her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cMy chest feels like it got rammed by a truck,\u201d he croaked. Tony and May both grimaced at the teen\u2019s voice. It was hellishly thick and raspy, somewhat reminding the billionaire of how he sounded following the abysmal waterboarding in Afghanistan. The man shook the thought from his head before his mind got lost in that dark place, but the comparison struck sorrow into his heart. The thought of Peter going through something as dreadful and vile as drowning sickened the man.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s expected,\u201d Bruce announced as he entered the room, accompanied by nurse Zenia. \u201cDo you feel any abnormalities outside of the discomfort?\u201d He asked, suddenly leaning over him and shining a penlight in the teen\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWoah, Doctor Banner, I\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cAre you dizzy? Trouble breathing? Any pain? Can you tell me your full name and date of birth?\u201d Peter obliged, but seemed very uncomfortable at being poked and prodded so promptly after awakening. \u201cOpen,\u201d Bruce commanded, sticking a thermometer under the boy\u2019s tongue. While he waited and Zenia took his pulse and blood pressure at the same time, Pete glanced over at his aunt with narrowed eyes. She in turn looked up at Tony, a silent exchange that told him to get Banner to lay off.</p><p>\u201cBruce, could we just\u2014 give him a little space, please?\u201d Tony spoke. The thermometer beeped and though the doctor looked less than satisfied, but nevertheless nodded at Zenia who gathered the vitals cart and wheeled it out. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the first time Mr. Stark has told somebody to <i>stop</i> fussing over me,\u201d Peter remarked. Tony rolled his eyes, however felt very much relieved now that Pete was cracking jokes.</p><p>\u201cSo, no brain damage then?\u201d May asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t appear to be,\u201d Bruce responded, removing his glasses. \u201cDo you want to ask him some questions, Tony?\u201d</p><p>The billionaire sighed, grabbing hold of Peter\u2019s hand. The teen\u2019s skin was still ice-cold and the man felt a sudden urge to wrap him in every blanket the tower owned. \u201cWhat do you remember about the attack, Pete?\u201d</p><p>The small grin the boy had disappeared from his face and his eyes downcast, grip on Tony\u2019s fingers tightening ever-so-slightly as he seemed to recall the events of the previous night. He opened his mouth once before clamping it shut again, repeating that action three times before finally speaking.</p><p>\u201cWe were on our way to the party,\u201d he said, eyes trained on the tube that led to his nasal cannula. \u201cMy spider-sense was ringing like crazy, but I figured it was just nerves. Then somebody cracked a crowbar into the side of my head and threw these gas thingies in. I blacked out after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Bruce urged.</p><p>\u201cI woke up in the back on the car handcuffed to the handlebar on the ceiling. There was a Russian man and some guy with a ski-mask on. The Russian one asked me why Mr. Rogers and his friends were pardoned, but he didn\u2019t believe me when I told him no and\u2014 and set the car to drive into the river,\u201d May squeezed Peter\u2019s wrist reassuringly when he hesitated. \u201cUm, they kept asking through a speaker while the water was filling up the car through holes they must\u2019ve drilled before I woke up. Eventually they believed me but it was already up to my chin and they just\u2014 <i>left</i> me there. I started punching the glass,\u201d he glanced over his bandaged knuckles, taking in a long, deep breath as if the room would fill with water any second. \u201cBut they\u2019re bulletproof and the water had filled the car so it was even harder. I\u2014 I kept going even when it hurt but it got so hard to hold my breath and oh my god, May, I thought I was going to <i>die</i> down there,\u201d a few tears pricked at the boy\u2019s eyes but he pushed them back, squeezing his eyes shut as his aunt engulfed him in a hug. Tony very gently clasped his hand a little tighter as he continued to recount the story into May\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe thought of you guys kept me going. I broke the window but I guess a piece of glass was still stuck in the framing because it caught on my ankle and trapped me there. I couldn\u2019t get it out and started to black out but\u2014 somebody saved me? Was it\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy,\u201d Tony finished. \u201cHe brought you here. Crashed our party. Which was going <i>egregiously</i> without you, might I add.\u201d</p><p>May pulled away and Peter let out a small giggle. Tony loved and hated it because it filled him with love and affection but at the same time reminded the man of just how small and young the boy was. Those men had just left him there to drown. God, as soon as he could Tony swore he would fly straight to whatever station they were being held at and deliver a beating twice that of Rhodey\u2019s.</p><p>But for now the kid needed him, and he wouldn\u2019t leave his side until he was bouncing off the walls, rambling on about the newest version of web fluid he\u2019d brainstormed or latest news on the upcoming Star Wars film.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Peter asked after Bruce completed all the required tests and they\u2019d settled in with some oh-so-tasty ice chips. \u201cWhy <i>was</i> Mr. Rogers pardoned?\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed. All this trouble for something so small and insignificant. The UN was planning on announcing everything in the coming days but for some bullshit legal reasons and to \u201cprevent panic\u201d they couldn\u2019t tell the public that. Clearly, it only caused further hysteria and drove people to attempt to kidnap and succeed in kidnapping Stark Industries personnel. Tony would be having a lengthy word with whoever\u2019s idea it was to hold off on sharing the information, legalities be damned.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t hurt to tell the kid now, would it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2026\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>Summary: Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter&rsquo;s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</i></p><p><i>But he kept fading.</i></p><p><b>{warnings: drowning, graphic depictions of medical procedures}</b></p><p>The people the media had dubbed as the <i>&lsquo;Rogue Avengers&rsquo;</i> were recently pardoned for reasons largely unknown. Not even Peter knew why, though upon questioning Tony about it the man tensed up prompting the teen to back off. He supposed it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal and if the general public weren&rsquo;t told why there&rsquo;s no reason he should&rsquo;ve been any different. However, now that they were all officially part of a team again, Pepper and T&rsquo;Challa decided the previously divided group needed to start having so-called bonding sessions. The awkwardness and tension between everybody was impossible to ignore, or so Tony and Rhodey told Peter one night during a lab session. Pepper said that it couldn&rsquo;t continue if they were to function normally on missions or in the battlefield, so she and (reluctantly) Tony organized a party set at the tower in typical Stark fashion.</p><p>To say Peter was nervous would be the understatement of the century.</p><p>When expressing his concern to May, she comforted him yet noted that he should turn those nerves into excitement. After all, it&rsquo;s not every day you get to hang out with the <i>Avengers</i>. Of course she was right, and of course he was excited but that anticipation was a mere speck compared to the storm of anxiety swirling in the pool of his gut. What if he did something stupid? Said something embarrassing? What if they kicked him out because he was a kid or didn&rsquo;t fit their standards of being a true hero.</p><p><i>What if they didn&rsquo;t like him?</i></p><p>Some of those thoughts may have been irrational&mdash; He&rsquo;s sure Tony wouldn&rsquo;t let the teen leave his sight&mdash; but they filled Peter&rsquo;s mind nonetheless. He didn&rsquo;t even really want to go to the gathering, but his mentor insisted, saying that despite him turning down an official spot on the Avengers he was still as much a part of the team as everyone else and the other members would need to get used to him being around. Peter guessed Tony was right and agreed, also deciding it better than to mention the fact that he knew the billionaire largely wanted Pete there to keep him grounded as well as a source of comfort. But that went unspoken.</p><p>So here Peter and Happy sat, stuck in a sea of Manhattan traffic. His Spidey-Senses were off the charts but he figured it was just because of the claustrophobia that came with being stuck amidst a swarm of dozens of cars that finally caused his pent up anxiety to come loose.</p><p>Happy honked and let out a colorful bout of curses due to some jerk in front of them who had carelessly swerved into the wrong lane at the wrong time and almost caused a pile-up. Aggressively rolling down the window and sticking his head out he shouted, &ldquo;Learn to use your turn signal, asshole!&rdquo;</p><p>All the while, Peter was trying to keep down the cafeteria made pizza he&rsquo;d had for lunch just hours prior. In an <i>hour </i>they&rsquo;d only managed to go three blocks. All this time sitting back against leather seating ensured his brain conjured up every possible embarrassing situation that could play out. That is, if they ever <i>got </i>to the damn party.</p><p>The teenager sighed as Happy slouched back into the driver&rsquo;s seat, grumbling to himself. Pete rested his elbow against the edge of the window and set his jaw into his palm, subconsciously bouncing his leg up and down so fast that Happy needed to tell the boy to stop as it was shaking the entire vehicle. Over the course of the next ten minutes he continued to change positions, shifting from one to the next in a desperate attempt to find one that would somehow calm him and ease the buzzing in the nape of his neck that was growing more irritating and impossible to ignore by the minute.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I just swing to the tower?&rdquo; He finally asked before unbuckling his seatbelt, stretching his legs across the three back seats of the car, deciding that position made everything <i>much</i> worse, and ultimately going back to a normal position again. Happy straightened before answering.</p><p>&ldquo;Boss has strict orders that I not let you out of my sight until we get to the tower,&rdquo; he adjusted the mirror to get a better view of Peter who was now biting his fingernails. &ldquo;Besides, last I knew Tony&rsquo;s still fixing up your suit from when you decided it was a good idea to take on a lunatic who could spit fire all by yourself,&rdquo; Happy remarked. Peter sighed, eyeing the compartment in his backpack where his web-shooters were stashed.</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time I&rsquo;ve gone out without the mask,&rdquo; he mumbled, rolling down the window to breathe in some fresh air. A little girl skipped by with an Iron Man balloon. &ldquo;Plus, I have superpowers. I can take care of myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter could practically feel the eye roll radiating off Happy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even going to bother telling you how stupid swinging around New York without your mask on is because I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re well aware, but,&rdquo; he gripped the steering wheel a little harder. &ldquo;You know how people have been about the pardoning. Just this morning some nut job tried to pull Pepper into his car to get information out of her.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart wrenched with concern. &ldquo;Is she okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little shaken, but fine. What I&rsquo;m saying is, if anybody thinks you know anything because of your internship, you could be at real risk and Tony&rsquo;s going to go to any lengths possible to prevent that. As am I,&rdquo; The car moved a few feet forward before lurching to a stop again, an echo of honks reverberating throughout the avenue. &ldquo;So if we have to sit here for another hour, so be it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter appreciated their concern, he really did. And he knew that Happy wasn&rsquo;t one to express such feelings so openly and this was a serious situation but god, his spidey-sense was going haywire and everything was becoming too much too much too<i> much&mdash;</i></p><p>So when a gloved hand smashed a crowbar into his temple through the window and a previously activated smoke grenade was tossed into the car, Peter couldn&rsquo;t exactly say he was surprised.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Peter opened his eyes to his worn sneakers planted firmly on the familiarly pristine carpet of Happy&rsquo;s black Sedan. The teen felt groggy, much like the time he woke up in the med bay after getting shot in his abdomen by some street thug trying to rob Sub Haven. His head was fuzzy and it took him a moment or two to realize the awkward position he was situated in&mdash; Zip tied to the chicken handle screwed to the roof of the car. His arms were hanging above him, bent ever-so-slightly and his head was hanging forward just short of resting against the front passenger&rsquo;s seat. Peter let out a quiet groan, lifting his head while he attempted to gather his bearings. He was in the same spot he was in when whoever it was hit him with that crowbar&mdash;</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His eyes snapped open, the boy now painfully aware of his surroundings. The car was nowhere near East 34th Street, instead parked by the docks of some old warehouse. The side of his head throbbed awfully as he turned his head to the left only to come face-to-face with a middle-aged man in a black hoodie grinning maliciously back. Peter started and backed up as far as he could against the door to put as much distance between himself and this cigar-smelling creep. One other man accompanied them in the car and was wearing a red ski mask, sat in the front seat while staring out at the sunset as if they hadn&rsquo;t just kidnapped a sixteen-year-old kid.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter Parker,&rdquo; The man said casually with a Russian accent. &ldquo;I heard you&rsquo;re close with Stark, yes?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter said nothing in response, only staring back with what he hoped were hard eyes. Showing fear and weakness would only prove to this man that he&rsquo;d already gotten underneath Peter&rsquo;s skin, and vulnerability was the last thing he needed. If Pete had any chance of outsmarting this guy and escaping unscathed he needed at least some remnants of the upper hand.</p><p>The sun was only just beginning to disappear over the horizon so it couldn&rsquo;t have been long, which could be either a good or bad thing. They weren&rsquo;t far from the city but it was too soon for anybody to have noticed their absence if word hadn&rsquo;t gotten out already. Peter was unconscious before he could see whether or not these men made a scene of their kidnapping or did it as discreetly as they could, so either Iron Man was searching the skies and would be blasting these men into the Hudson within minutes, or Mr. Stark was waiting insouciantly for their arrival at the tower. Peter clenched his fists hard, just short of breaking skin. He was suddenly very aware of how uncomfortable having your arms hung above your head for so long was if the first twinges of muscle cramps were anything to go by.</p><p>When Peter still didn&rsquo;t answer, the man sighed and picked up the crowbar from where it was set on the floor. Peter tensed as his kidnapper gripped the jagged end firmly, jabbing the rounded steel into his stomach. The boy wheezed and made an attempt to further back into the door, but was met with little success.</p><p>&ldquo;When I ask a question,&rdquo; he flipped his hold on the crowbar and prodded the pigfoot along the teen&rsquo;s bobbing throat where he was still struggling to draw in a proper breath. &ldquo;You answer. Capiche?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded and the man placed the tool gently into his lap, though it did little to relax the teen. He then leaned back casually against the opposite door with an unreadable expression plastered across his face, running his thumb against the polyester seatbelt absentmindedly.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re close with Stark?&rdquo; He asked again. Peter swallowed the lump in his throat, finally having recovered from the violent blow before answering.</p><p>&ldquo;You could say that,&rdquo; it came out less shaky than he thought it would, and the boy felt a mini-surge of confidence. &ldquo;What the hell do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>His abductor huffed a laugh at his nerve before sitting up straight and tipping forwards again. He clasped his hands together, staring at them for a moment before looking directly at Peter. &ldquo;I want to know why that scum was pardoned.&rdquo;</p><p>His heart dropped. God, Happy was right. Happy was right and Peter didn&rsquo;t take him seriously and now he was zip tied in the back of a car with two strangers who probably had every intention of hurting him for this information. He should be by Tony&rsquo;s side right now, laughing off awkward conversations with unfamiliar members of the team but instead he was being threatened by some crazy Russian dude and his eerily silent friend.</p><p>Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They didn&rsquo;t tell me&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bullshit!&rdquo; The man shrieked, making Peter flinch. &ldquo;I am not interested in being here for long. I am not interested in hurting you. Just tell me what I want and I will release you,&rdquo; his voice got lower, &ldquo;but I <i>will</i> do what I have to in order to get what I am looking for. Easy or hard way, you choose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m just an intern. I&rsquo;m not cleared to receive that kind of information!&rdquo; He reasoned. The man only grew more irritated, twisting his body to unlock the door. He shoved it open with a grunt and motioned for his accomplice to do the same, muttering a quick word that Peter didn&rsquo;t quite pick up on.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he announced, slamming the door while the ski mask-clad man shifted the gears and fiddled with the gas below the steering wheel. &ldquo;Hard way it is.&rdquo; His accomplice appeared to finish whatever he was setting up and glanced over his shoulder at the Russian man who gave a nod. He yanked something harshly, took several swift steps backward, and the tires began screeching. The car remained in place for a moment as it struggled to gain traction and once it did the car sped forward, momentum pushing Peter up against the back of the seat as the vehicle rolled off of the dock and into the river below.</p><p>For a second Peter did nothing, shock and confusion clouding his thinking. But then the car began to sink faster than it should have as water poured into the car through wide holes drilled into the floor beneath the seats that Peter had failed to notice beforehand and he began to panic. Within seconds the car was already submerged halfway under the surface and the water pooling in the car reached Pete&rsquo;s ankles.</p><p>&ldquo;Rethink your decision, Peter,&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice sounded through a mini-speaker that was haphazardly taped to the ceiling of the car just short of the windshield. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly rescue you, but only if I get what I want.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter clenched his fists in annoyance and fright, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything!&rdquo;</p><p>The teen&rsquo;s breathing began to pick up and he desperately tried to keep it under control as the car was now fully submerged. He didn&rsquo;t want to waste the limited air supply he may have and spiraling into a full-blown panic attack definitely wouldn&rsquo;t help.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me an answer,&rdquo; the criminal said firmly. &ldquo;The car&rsquo;s filling up quick, is it not?&rdquo; Peter clenched his jaw because yes, it absolutely was. It was pooling above his knees and creeping up towards his abdomen. At this rate he&rsquo;d be completely under in less than a minute.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to believe me, they didn&rsquo;t tell me anything!&rdquo; He shouted, mind scrambling for something he could say to get him out of this. &ldquo;I&mdash; I can get it for you!&rdquo; He tried. &ldquo;I was on my way to see him earlier, just let me see Mr. Stark and I&rsquo;ll convince him to tell me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you can get him to swaddle you with protection? So you can rat me out? I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he spoke. The ice-cold water lapped just below Peter&rsquo;s neck, and he snapped the cuffs apart without care. There weren&rsquo;t any camera&rsquo;s visible and he needed to get out. &ldquo;Last chance, <i>&#1088;&#1077;&#1073;&#1077;&#1085;&#1086;&#1082;</i>,&rdquo; he spat. &ldquo;Why where they pardoned?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter began slamming the window as hard as he could, his final response punctuated with each punch to the glass, &ldquo;I. Don&rsquo;t. <i>Know!</i>&rdquo; The liquid that now came to his chin was substantially hindering the force of his hits, not to mention the fact the Tony had modified the windows to be <i>bulletproof</i> didn&rsquo;t help his case. But he kept going regardless, striking the pane with all his might.</p><p>While doing so the boy distantly heard the two men conversing over the speaker before the Russian man announced, &ldquo;I believe you. In that case, I have no further use for you,&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s heart dropped.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he muttered. The teen now had to tilt his head upwards to keep it above the surface of the water, his forehead resting against the ceiling of the car. &ldquo;No! Come back!&rdquo; He pleaded. &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t leave me here!&rdquo; But it was useless. He was soaked head-to-toe and was about to drown if he didn&rsquo;t break this damned glass. So he squeezed his eyes shut, took in the deepest breath he could muster, and allowed the water to engulf him.</p><p>The silence that followed was excruciating. Compared to the fast-paced sound of water rushing in, his panicked huffing filling the air, and the crackling of his abductor&rsquo;s voice over that speaker, the complete and utter lack of noise was disturbing.</p><p>People always said drowning was the most peaceful way to go. Peter never understood that statement. He had never drowned, but it looked anything but peaceful and judging by the ache of his lungs that were screaming at him to take a breath, his inevitable demise would be agonizing. It was only then that he understood what they were talking about&mdash; the peacefulness was breathtaking (What an ironic choice of words, Peter thought bitterly). It wasn&rsquo;t that he was at peace because God, was he far from it, however even as his mind scrambled and fell apart in his struggle to survive it was oddly&hellip; serene.</p><p>Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad way to go.</p><p>The boy quickly shook that thought from his head, berating himself for almost giving up so quickly. How could he say that? How could he have thought of leaving everything behind, even for a second? Peter had his whole life ahead of him. Who would build LEGO sets with Ned, answer all the physics questions during decathlon meets? Tony wouldn&rsquo;t handle his loss well, the man&rsquo;s liver would probably give out as he tried to drink away the guilt. And God, <i>May</i>. She&rsquo;s lost everything and Peter would be damned if that woman had to lose him too.</p><p>Peter suddenly felt a surge of anger, at himself, at the men who took him, the rogue avengers, the government, at Mr. Stark for making this fucking glass so assuredly impenetrable. He hit harder than before, not caring that his knuckles had split open and stained the water a murky crimson.</p><p><i>Come on</i>, he thought. <i>Break. Break. Break!</i></p><p>Just as the teen&rsquo;s strength began wearing thin and his hope began to dwindle once again, the smallest of cracks appeared where the window was slightly smeared with blood. His lungs and muscles burned like hell but he wasn&rsquo;t going to give up now. Peter grit his teeth and drove his fist into the pane again. He never thought the sound of glass giving in could be so sweet.</p><p>The fractures in the pane spread further, resembling a spider&rsquo;s web more and more with each hit. Just a few more, he was almost there and&mdash;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s fist smashed through the window and the shards scattered into the liquid around him, a few pieces getting caught in his knuckles. But the teen didn&rsquo;t notice and he pushed himself through the opening as hard as he could, longing for the surface that seemed so close yet so far. In his desperation, Peter didn&rsquo;t spot the pointed, jagged edges of broken glass that remained attached to the frame of the window. It wasn&rsquo;t until he came to an abrupt halt that he looked down and pain overcame him in a harrowing wave.</p><p>One of the remaining shards had caught onto the boy&rsquo;s pant leg, slicing through the fabric and into the skin of his ankle. It dug into him like a fishing hook, anchoring him to the car. Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a shout of pain, eyes going wide and mouth snapping shut when he realized that <i>shit</i>, that was all of his air. Suddenly the pain in his ankle didn&rsquo;t seem so bad as his lungs started to spasm with the need for air the sudden absence of it. Peter bent down, pulling at the glass shard itself because it was stuck into him at too awkward of an angle for him to take it out on his own. The glass needed to come with him, but damn this reinforced car because it wasn&rsquo;t coming loose. He was thrashing now as his muscles and mind went into one final fit of hysteria in a last-ditch attempt to get free. Little did Peter know that by doing so he was only embedding the shard further into his ankle but it didn&rsquo;t matter because he couldn&rsquo;t breathe, he needed to breathe, needed to breathe, <i>needed to the breathe.</i></p><p>Eventually Peter&rsquo;s movements began to slow down, his grip on the object going slack as he subconsciously focused all attention on not taking a breath. His chest rose and fell as his body&rsquo;s instincts took over, not caring whether he would breathe in water or not. But Peter refused to open his mouth, he couldn&rsquo;t. For Ned, for MJ, for Happy and Tony and May.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter&rsquo;s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</p><p>But he kept fading.</p><p>Even when a set of burly arms somehow detached his ankle from the glass, wrapping around his middle and pulling him towards the surface he continued to evanesce. Distantly he registered them getting closer to the evening sunlight, closer to air that he could safely breathe in.</p><p>But he had held it for so long. He couldn&rsquo;t hold back any longer. His mind was slipping, his vision was dissolving into nothingness and he no longer had control.</p><p>Water filled his lungs.</p><p>He took a breath.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Chill out, Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony whipped around, staring Sam Wilson down with a death glare that could intimidate even the most hardened criminals. &ldquo;<i>&lsquo;Chill out&rsquo;</i>?&rdquo; Tony fumed, taking a step towards him. Rhodey set his drink down at the bar and made his way towards the scene. &ldquo;They were supposed to be here an hour and a half ago. Neither of them are returning my calls, I can&rsquo;t track their phones or the car they took, and you expect me to chill out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tones, hey,&rdquo; Rhodes crossed a hand over his friend&rsquo;s chest, guiding him away from where Sam had a hand placed threateningly over his wristwatch. The man appeared a moment away from summoning Redwing and Tony a second away from calling a suit. This definitely wasn&rsquo;t the vibe they had aimed for when planning a team bonding party. &ldquo;Stand down. Starting a fight with Wilson won&rsquo;t help anyone,&rdquo; Tony grumbled, relaxing his fists and turning the other way to follow Rhodey to the bar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they just got stuck in a traffic jam. Happens all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I took that into account, Rhodes,&rdquo; He politely declined a drink from the bartender and leaned against the counter, &ldquo;Even with traffic they should have been here a long time ago,&rdquo; the man picked up a generous amount of pecan cheese wafers from a platter and scarfed them down. Stress eating wouldn&rsquo;t help anyone either but hey, old habits die hard. Rhodes began to say something again but Tony tuned him out, staring at the double doors as if Happy would come stumbling through them with Peter safely in arms any second.</p><p>And they did.</p><p>Well, minus the &lsquo;safely&rsquo; part.</p><p>The pair burst through the doors, startling everybody on the team so effectively they all went into their respective fighting stances. Happy and Peter were drenched head-to-toe, the older man out of breath, completely supporting the younger one who seemed to barely be breathing at all. In a blur, Tony sprinted towards the two as the head of security halfheartedly plopped Peter onto the ground. The boy stayed down, not moving an inch even when Tony appeared by his side.</p><p>&ldquo;Hap, what the hell happened?&rdquo; Tony yelled, taking Peter&rsquo;s head in his lap. There was a half-healed gash at his temple and the boy&rsquo;s eyes were closed. His mouth was parted and skin white as a sheet, breathing gravelly and short. &ldquo;Bruce, get your ass over here! Friday, prep the med team,&rdquo; the billionaire ordered. Banner appeared on the other side of Peter less than a second later, assessing him as best he could. Tony was now focused on the hideous wound in the kid&rsquo;s ankle that was bleeding profusely, and the man wondered how long it had been since he&rsquo;d sustained the injury. How much blood had he lost? How did he get a cut like that? Why were they so wet, and why did Peter&rsquo;s breathing sound like his throat had been put through a meat grinder? Seeing as the teen was unconscious the only person who could answer these question was Happy, whom Rhodey was surveying.</p><p>Tony jumped up, hesitant to leave Peter&rsquo;s side but trusting Bruce to take care of him and desperate to know what the hell happened. Rhodes seemed to have sat Happy down in a nearby chair, the man staring straight ahead with a frightfully bloody nose Tony previously failed to notice. The colonel was quietly coaxing him as the billionaire approached.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s unresponsive,&rdquo; Rhodes said before Tony got the chance to speak. &ldquo;Either someone drugged him or he&rsquo;s got one hell of a concussion.&rdquo;</p><p>By now the rest of the team had gathered around the scene, some doing what they could to help, others not sure what that was and just watching. Wilson and a few others had already raced up to the Med Bay to help the nursing staff since most were off because of the party and Bruce was continuing to look over Peter with the assistance of Rogers. Tony would be lying if the idea of Steve being there instead of him didn&rsquo;t make him feel a surge of protectiveness and hostility, but logically he knew he was only helping and if Tony wanted to do the same he needed to get answers.</p><p>&ldquo;Unresponsive?&rdquo; Tony questioned rhetorically. &ldquo;Hap, come on. What happened? Why do you two look like you just took a cat dive into the Hudson?&rdquo; The man didn&rsquo;t answer, staring straight through Tony. The man would&rsquo;ve kept trying but Bruce&rsquo;s next words sent ice through the man&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got water in his lungs!&rdquo; He shouted, &ldquo;We need to get him to the Med Bay, <i>now!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>All thoughts of questioning Happy were wiped from Tony&rsquo;s mind. The next few minutes were a complete blur. Steve and T&rsquo;Challa helped carefully but quickly carry Peter down to the medical ward until the nurses met them halfway with a pair of stretchers. Nat and Rhodes handed Happy off, two nurses helping him while the rest focused on Peter, hooking the boy up to wires and checking his vitals as they wheeled him into a room.</p><p>&ldquo;Prep him for thoracentesis,&rdquo; Bruce instructed. Tony didn&rsquo;t have any clue as to what that procedure was but judging by the size of the needle a nurse he knew by the name of Zenia whipped out, it was nothing good.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah&mdash; Jesus, Bruce, what the hell&mdash;?&rdquo; Tony began to ramble but was cut off by Banner&rsquo;s hand. He was highly focused as he typically was while working and hated distractions, but this was his kid and Tony demanded to know what was going on and what they were about to do to him. Bruce sighed before looking him in the eye and giving him a rundown.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter has water in his lungs. We aren&rsquo;t sure how much but we need to get it out and the only way to do that quickly and efficiently is by inserting a needle into the thorax and draining it from there into a bag. He&rsquo;s sustained other injuries but none are life-threatening and if we don&rsquo;t clear his lungs we could be facing organ failure because his blood isn&rsquo;t being properly oxygenated,&rdquo; he spoke carefully as the nurses worked together to lift Peter into a sitting position, remove his dampened sweater and lean him against the over-bed table so his back was bent and exposed. His skin was ghostly pale and the way his torso just barely rose and fell made Tony sick. Bile rose in his throat at the sight and he turned away before it could make him vomit. The man still didn&rsquo;t know what happened, but after the stunt that lowlife pulled with Pepper he had a sneaking suspicion it had something to do with the accords. If he was right and Peter suffered because of that&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; Bruce spoke softly, slipping latex gloves on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the best medical team on the East Coast. Let us do our job, alright? He&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony prayed he was right.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>If there was one thing Tony never wanted to witness again, it was a goddamn thoracentesis. Maybe it was the fact that it was being performed on Peter of all people, but sickening squelch of the syringe puncturing his lung was unexpected and completely revolting. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, watching murky fluid leak out of his body through a tube and into a waiting plastic bag was almost just as bad. The amount of water was more than they&rsquo;d anticipated, calling for them to switch out the collection pouch once for each lung. The procedure as a whole didn&rsquo;t take very long but it was borderline traumatizing for Tony nonetheless, he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get the image of the kid bent over the table with two needles poking into his lungs out of his head for days to come. He&rsquo;d never been so grateful the teen was unconscious.</p><p>Tony guessed Rhodes or Friday had called May because not long after it was over the woman was bursting through the doors of the room and jogging towards her unconscious nephew. Joining Tony&rsquo;s side the woman, who was still clad in her own nursing scrubs, held her hand up to her mouth and let out a soft gasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, what did they do to you?&rdquo; She whispered, clearly wanting nothing more than to comfort him but stayed put, knowing better than anyone that Bruce and the nurses needed to do their jobs.</p><p>A few of Peter&rsquo;s knuckles were fractured on each hand and fifteen minutes were spent painstakingly picking glass shards from the cuts on both, a clear indication that there was a struggle. The gash on his ankle looked like a stab wound but upon closer inspection was too sloppy and torn much too awkwardly to have been caused by a knife. The best they could do was treat it and wait until he or Happy woke up to ask what happened.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t for another hour and a half when they completed dressing Peter&rsquo;s injuries and treating Happy that the older man finally became coherent and responsive. Bruce was called into the room and Tony followed, knowing Peter was in safe enough hands with his aunt.</p><p>They entered Happy&rsquo;s room across the hall, the billionaire very surprised to see him already sitting up and talking to the nurse.</p><p>&ldquo;Is the kid okay?&rdquo; Happy was asking repeatedly. The nurse opened her mouth to respond but when the bodyguard caught sight of Tony and Bruce he completely disregarded her, almost jumping out of bed. The two men pushed him back down delicately, reprimanding him for being so careless.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus, Hap, do you have a death wish?&rdquo; Tony said. The man had his head bandaged, nose also wrapped as it had been severely broken. Getting up so fast was a sure-fire way to collapse and hit his already fractured skull on the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, is he&mdash;? I tried to&mdash; but they were&mdash; I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he stumbled over his words, looking on the verge of tears. It caught Tony off guard. He&rsquo;d never seen the man so vulnerable and emotional.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter will be fine,&rdquo; Bruce cut in. Happy sagged with relief, closing his eyes and sinking into the sheets. &ldquo;Happy, can you tell us what happened?&rdquo; The doctor asked gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; Happy muttered under his breath, vigorously rubbing his face before meeting Tony&rsquo;s eyes with the most undeniably apologetic look he&rsquo;d ever seen. &ldquo;We were on our way to the tower,&rdquo; he started, looking down. &ldquo;We were stuck in traffic, stopped beside an alleyway. They came up and threw some kind of gas in. I got out before breathing it all in but Peter was already out cold in the backseat. They dragged me into the alley and&mdash;&ldquo; he stopped, eyebrows furrowing as he concentrated on trying to remember the following events. &ldquo;I guess they hit my head pretty hard. Everything else is there in bits and pieces. I remember they took the car, they disabled the tracking device and tossed out his phone but the kid had those spider tracer doohickies in his bag. I think I used those to find him. I&rsquo;m not so sure how I got there, but I know that they brought him to the docks and drove the car into the water with&mdash; with Peter in it,&rdquo; Tony grit his teeth. <i>Oh</i>. &ldquo;I knocked those bastard&rsquo;s out and dove after him. Everything else up until ten minutes ago is gone. I dunno why I didn&rsquo;t call for backup, I&rsquo;m so sorry, Tony. It should have never happened in the&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, hey,&rdquo; Tony said, placing a hand on the man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You did just fine, Hap. The kid&rsquo;s alive and he&rsquo;s going to be okay, all thanks to you. It&rsquo;s not your fault some lunatics went after Peter.&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. And with the damage done to your head, it&rsquo;s a wonder you&rsquo;re conscious now, much less able to accomplish all that. When you came in it was like you were in a trance, your brain must have been focused on getting Peter to the safest place possible, which is here,&rdquo; Bruce nodded, squeezing his shoulder in reassurance. &ldquo;Like Tony said, you did a fantastic job. Now <i>rest</i>. Let your body recover. And don&rsquo;t make me sedate you,&rdquo; he warned, pointing a finger at the bodyguard. &ldquo;Again.&rdquo;</p><p>Happy raised in hands in defense, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, doc. I think I could sleep for the next century.&rdquo;</p><p>With that problem settled, Tony returned to Peter&rsquo;s side and got started on the next one&mdash; apprehending the numbskulls who caused this problem in the first place. The billionaire tracked down the car just as Happy had, locating the spider-tracers with ease. He notified the authorities and Rhodey suited up to deal with any <i>problems</i> they may encounter and, as May put it, give them &ldquo;a good clobbering&rdquo;. Not too long after leaving the tower Tony was notified that the two men were in custody and if the bruised and bloody mugshots were anything to go by, Rhodes kept up on his promise. Apparently they had some vendetta against Cap and his entourage, but as long as the two were no longer a threat Tony couldn&rsquo;t give two shits what their reasoning was. There was no excuse for kidnapping a child, especially one as innocent and undeserving as Peter.</p><p>Speaking of, the kid didn&rsquo;t wake up until early the next morning. Four, to be exact, but it wasn&rsquo;t like anyone got much sleep anyways. It was fairly touch-and-go all night since they could only estimate how long Peter was breathing with liquid in his lungs, so the extent of damage was TBD. His organs were working fine however if his blood wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently oxygenated, there was a high chance of brain damage and it was almost impossible to tell while unconscious. So when he woke up so soon, it was a major relief for everybody.</p><p>The boy awoke and immediately tensed up, only relaxing when his eyes landed on May and Tony. He squeezed his eyes shut and winced in discomfort.</p><p>&ldquo;How you feeling, bud?&rdquo; Tony asked, pressing the call button. May smiled down at her nephew, running her fingers through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;My chest feels like it got rammed by a truck,&rdquo; he croaked. Tony and May both grimaced at the teen&rsquo;s voice. It was hellishly thick and raspy, somewhat reminding the billionaire of how he sounded following the abysmal waterboarding in Afghanistan. The man shook the thought from his head before his mind got lost in that dark place, but the comparison struck sorrow into his heart. The thought of Peter going through something as dreadful and vile as drowning sickened the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s expected,&rdquo; Bruce announced as he entered the room, accompanied by nurse Zenia. &ldquo;Do you feel any abnormalities outside of the discomfort?&rdquo; He asked, suddenly leaning over him and shining a penlight in the teen&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, Doctor Banner, I&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you dizzy? Trouble breathing? Any pain? Can you tell me your full name and date of birth?&rdquo; Peter obliged, but seemed very uncomfortable at being poked and prodded so promptly after awakening. &ldquo;Open,&rdquo; Bruce commanded, sticking a thermometer under the boy&rsquo;s tongue. While he waited and Zenia took his pulse and blood pressure at the same time, Pete glanced over at his aunt with narrowed eyes. She in turn looked up at Tony, a silent exchange that told him to get Banner to lay off.</p><p>&ldquo;Bruce, could we just&mdash; give him a little space, please?&rdquo; Tony spoke. The thermometer beeped and though the doctor looked less than satisfied, but nevertheless nodded at Zenia who gathered the vitals cart and wheeled it out. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the first time Mr. Stark has told somebody to <i>stop</i> fussing over me,&rdquo; Peter remarked. Tony rolled his eyes, however felt very much relieved now that Pete was cracking jokes.</p><p>&ldquo;So, no brain damage then?&rdquo; May asked hopefully.</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t appear to be,&rdquo; Bruce responded, removing his glasses. &ldquo;Do you want to ask him some questions, Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>The billionaire sighed, grabbing hold of Peter&rsquo;s hand. The teen&rsquo;s skin was still ice-cold and the man felt a sudden urge to wrap him in every blanket the tower owned. &ldquo;What do you remember about the attack, Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>The small grin the boy had disappeared from his face and his eyes downcast, grip on Tony&rsquo;s fingers tightening ever-so-slightly as he seemed to recall the events of the previous night. He opened his mouth once before clamping it shut again, repeating that action three times before finally speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;We were on our way to the party,&rdquo; he said, eyes trained on the tube that led to his nasal cannula. &ldquo;My spider-sense was ringing like crazy, but I figured it was just nerves. Then somebody cracked a crowbar into the side of my head and threw these gas thingies in. I blacked out after that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Bruce urged.</p><p>&ldquo;I woke up in the back on the car handcuffed to the handlebar on the ceiling. There was a Russian man and some guy with a ski-mask on. The Russian one asked me why Mr. Rogers and his friends were pardoned, but he didn&rsquo;t believe me when I told him no and&mdash; and set the car to drive into the river,&rdquo; May squeezed Peter&rsquo;s wrist reassuringly when he hesitated. &ldquo;Um, they kept asking through a speaker while the water was filling up the car through holes they must&rsquo;ve drilled before I woke up. Eventually they believed me but it was already up to my chin and they just&mdash; <i>left</i> me there. I started punching the glass,&rdquo; he glanced over his bandaged knuckles, taking in a long, deep breath as if the room would fill with water any second. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re bulletproof and the water had filled the car so it was even harder. I&mdash; I kept going even when it hurt but it got so hard to hold my breath and oh my god, May, I thought I was going to <i>die</i> down there,&rdquo; a few tears pricked at the boy&rsquo;s eyes but he pushed them back, squeezing his eyes shut as his aunt engulfed him in a hug. Tony very gently clasped his hand a little tighter as he continued to recount the story into May&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;The thought of you guys kept me going. I broke the window but I guess a piece of glass was still stuck in the framing because it caught on my ankle and trapped me there. I couldn&rsquo;t get it out and started to black out but&mdash; somebody saved me? Was it&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Happy,&rdquo; Tony finished. &ldquo;He brought you here. Crashed our party. Which was going <i>egregiously</i> without you, might I add.&rdquo;</p><p>May pulled away and Peter let out a small giggle. Tony loved and hated it because it filled him with love and affection but at the same time reminded the man of just how small and young the boy was. Those men had just left him there to drown. God, as soon as he could Tony swore he would fly straight to whatever station they were being held at and deliver a beating twice that of Rhodey&rsquo;s.</p><p>But for now the kid needed him, and he wouldn&rsquo;t leave his side until he was bouncing off the walls, rambling on about the newest version of web fluid he&rsquo;d brainstormed or latest news on the upcoming Star Wars film.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Peter asked after Bruce completed all the required tests and they&rsquo;d settled in with some oh-so-tasty ice chips. &ldquo;Why <i>was</i> Mr. Rogers pardoned?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed. All this trouble for something so small and insignificant. The UN was planning on announcing everything in the coming days but for some bullshit legal reasons and to &ldquo;prevent panic&rdquo; they couldn&rsquo;t tell the public that. Clearly, it only caused further hysteria and drove people to attempt to kidnap and succeed in kidnapping Stark Industries personnel. Tony would be having a lengthy word with whoever&rsquo;s idea it was to hold off on sharing the information, legalities be damned.</p><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to tell the kid now, would it?</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story&hellip;&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><i>Summary: Despite his best efforts, within seconds his mind began to fade. Peter&rsquo;s vision started to dim and he blinked in a weak attempt to stay conscious because he knew if he blacked out, there was nothing preventing his body from breathing in the water.</i></p>\n<p><i>But he kept fading.</i></p>\n<p><b>{warnings: drowning, graphic depictions of medical procedures}</b></p>\n<p>The people the media had dubbed as the <i>&lsquo;Rogue Avengers&rsquo;</i> were recently pardoned for reasons largely unknown. Not even Peter knew why, though upon questioning Tony about it the man tensed up prompting the teen to back off. He supposed it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal and if the general public weren&rsquo;t told why there&rsquo;s no reason he should&rsquo;ve been any different. However, now that they were all officially part of a team again, Pepper and T&rsquo;Challa decided the previously divided group needed to start having so-called bonding sessions. The awkwardness and tension between everybody was impossible to ignore, or so Tony and Rhodey told Peter one night during a lab session. Pepper said that it couldn&rsquo;t continue if they were to function normally on missions or in the battlefield, so she and (reluctantly) Tony organized a party set at the tower in typical Stark fashion.</p>\n<p>To say Peter was nervous would be the understatement of the century.</p>\n</p>",

It turns out the art gallery in front of the pub we were at was having some sort of expo and there were crisps and small snacks on a table in the middle of the room. We look through the window to see my friend snatching as many crisps as he can from the plates, so his Mum sends his Dad in to go and stop him. We watch through the window as his Dad then goes in and starts helping him steal the crisps and honestly i just feel like this is something Peter and Tony would do. </p>",
