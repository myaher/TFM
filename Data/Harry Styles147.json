Well, 9. Harry\u2019s fling wanted to join the movie marathon, and y/n is infuriated.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he message y/n before hand that he will bring someone in their movie marathon? What is his point? Just because they broke up two weeks ago, he wanted to make y/n jealous?</p><p>The clock striked 6pm. One by one of their friends would arrive and y/n would answer the door.</p><p>\u201cOh! Come on in. There are wine and cheese platter in the kitchen. There are beers inside the fridge and snacks in the cupboard. Just help yourself.\u201d y/n called out to their friends as she answered the door.</p><p>Before she could face the person who she opened the door for, she was enveloped into a hug and the familiar scent made her head dizzy. \u201cHello. I missed you.\u201d Harry said to her. Y/n hummed and untangled herself from the hug.</p><p>Harry was smiling. Like really smiling. His dimples were out and about. Standing beside him was a beautiful and petite girl. And y/n didn\u2019t realize that she was staring at her and their entwined hands. When Harry saw on what she was staring, he cleared his throat and that made y/n come back to her senses, \u201cFuck. I\u2019m so rude for staring. I\u2019m y/n, Harry\u2019s e- I mean, friend.\u201d She said smiling at her and brought her hand forward awaiting Harry\u2019s companion to introduce herself, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m Nadine.\u201d The girl replied and shook her hand.</p><p>She smiled and stepped to the side to let them in.</p><p>All smile and eyes twinkling was the thing that you can see on y/n, but inside, she was screaming her head off and breaking into pieces.</p><p>When everyone was complete and is already situated in her living room, y/n took the popcorn and mozzarella sticks to the living room to get the movie marathon started.</p><p>\u201cKent? Will you do the honors to present me the genre bowl for tonight? So we would know what genre of movie that we\u2019re going to watch.\u201d Their friend Kent stood up and took the glass bowl filled with folded papers that contained movie genres of all sorts and stood beside y/n. \u201cHere. Take one.\u201d Y/n took a piece of paper and unfolded it. As she was unfolding it, she saw Harry and Nadine all cuddled up on the sofa and not paying attention to what\u2019s happening in front of them.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck. Great! It\u2019s Horror. Can I choose something else?\u201d Y/n sighed. She\u2019s not a fan of horror movies at ALL. One time, when they had chosen Horror as the genre of film that they\u2019ll be watching in their friend Leah\u2019s apartment, y/n forced everyone to sleep in one bedroom with all the lights on. She was THAT terrified.</p><p>That\u2019s why she was unsure of this genre that she had picked. \u201cNope! We\u2019ve been watching Comedy and Romance way too long. Like four movie marathons in a row. Horror is a breathe of fresh air.\u201d Kent said as y/n\u2019s shoulder slumped with his statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just get on with it, I guess.\u201d Y/n replied, still sad and truly horrified on what\u2019s about to happen in tonight\u2019s movie marathon.</p><p>Y/n went to her iPad and connected to the Apple TV so that they can watch it on Netflix. Y/n didn\u2019t know this kind of stuff. Harry gave the Apple TV as a present, and she hadn\u2019t used it only if needed to.</p><p>Leah saw that she was struggling connecting the iPad to the Apple TV, so she threw a pillow in Harry\u2019s direction. Which he was still flirting with Nadine. \u201cOi, mate! Help y/n with the setup and stop sucking each other\u2019s faces. Jeez!\u201d Harry rolled his eyes at Leah and mocked her. He untangled himself from Nadine and kissed her temple as he stood up to help y/n.</p><p>Y/n handed her iPad to Harry, and he took it. Within 2 minutes, the iPad was already connected, and Harry gave it back to y/n.</p><p>Y/n thanked Harry, and he smiled back at her. Y/n turned around from them and made a gagging gesture. </p><p>Y/n picked \u201cThe Nun\u201d and sat down beside the two love birds. She just rolled her eyes and munch on the popcorn as she was intently watching the movie and trying not to flinch or scream that much because there is no one there to hold her. She felt a tap on her shoulder, and that made her scream out loud and made a mess from her popcorn bowl.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! I\u2019m so sorry, Y/N. I just wanted to ask you if are there any more beers in the fridge? Nadine wanted some.\u201d Harry said hurriedly. Y/n was clutching her chest at the moment and heaving out loud. \u201cYou fucker! You could\u2019ve called me and not tap my shoulder. And to answer your question, no. There aren\u2019t any more beers in the fridge. I only bought eight cans.\u201d Y/N hit Harry\u2019s arm and diverted her gaze back to the movie. </p><p>Harry snickered and slumped back to the couch, \u201cHere, baby. Just drink mine. I\u2019ll just go get some water for us.\u201d He said while holding his beer out to Nadine. He stood up and shrugged out the popcorn kernels from his jeans and went to the kitchen. </p><p>Y/n just rolled her eyes again.<i> \u201cWho the fuck does he think he is? Making me jealous and calling her fling \u2018baby\u2019? All he ever called \u2018baby\u2019 was me! Okay, I know we broke up, but that was his type of endearment to me!\u201d</i> Having a monologue inside her brain. Y/N had a frown etched on her face while watching the movie. Not that interested and scared anymore with the movie ever since Harry called Nadine \u201cbaby.\u201d</p><p>Harry came back with two bottles of water in hand and gave the other one to Nadine. \u201cThanks, bub.\u201d Nadine cooed at Harry and kissed his cheeks. And y/n still had a frown on her face.</p><p>As the movie progresses, y/n was already bored of it and not interested in it. Since she knew that Taissa Farmiga was in the movie because apparently, Taissa was too pretty and cute for Y/N that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t terrified anymore. </p><p>She was playing a game on her phone when she felt someone kicking her sides. When she glanced beside her, Nadine was already laying down the sofa, and her head was on Harry\u2019s lap.</p><p>Y/n groaned and brushed off Nadine\u2019s leg which caught their attention. Y/n just looked at them and raised her eyebrows. Gesturing at Nadine\u2019s feet nudging her. Nadine smiled and said a soft \u201csorry\u201d to her. Y/n nodded and returned playing on her phone.</p><p>After a few minutes while she was already in Level 168 of Happy Glass when she lost grip on her phone due to someone\u2019s foot colliding with her phone screen.</p><p>She stood up and paused the movie. Earning a few groans from their friends. She flicked on the light switch of her living room only to see Harry and Nadine full on snogging.</p><p>Y/n\u2019s eyes went wide with what she saw and heard a few gasps behind her. She saw Nadine\u2019s water bottle on the table, she opened it and threw the contents of the bottle to them.</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE FUCK!\u201d Harry yelled, abruptly standing up which resulted to Nadine falling off the couch. \u201cOW! HARRY!\u201d Nadine moaned while clutching her arm. \u201cOh, fuck! I\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d Harry immediately rushed to her side and helped her sat down the sofa.</p><p>And that statement, made y/n lose her mind. \u201cBABY? Are you fucking kidding me?\u201d Y/n yelled at the top of her lungs. Making everyone go silent. Only y/n\u2019s breathing will be heard. Harry and Nadine looked small in y/n\u2019s gaze. Only if looks could kill, they\u2019d be dead for sure.</p><p>Leah ran to y/n\u2019s side and rubbed her back and whispered, \u201cCalm down, y/n. <i>You\u2019re better than this. </i>Don\u2019t do it.\u201d That made y/n tear up. A tear after another and  another fell down y/n\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I didn\u2019t complained to you when you said you were going to have a plus one in this movie marathon and you didn\u2019t informed me in advance. Second, you weren\u2019t paying attention to the movie and to me while I was infront. And thirdly, I am deeply hurt. You\u2019re already moved on even tho we\u2019ve only broken up 2 weeks ago.\u201d After that outburst, y/n ran to her room and locked herself there. </p><p>Knock and screams is the only thing that is consuming the apartment. Apart from blaming Harry to all of this. She can hear their friends going to the other room to sleep or to just talk to each other of what just happened to y/n.</p><p>Y/n was laying on her bed facing the wall and she heard a click on her door knob and a silhouette came in view from her wall. \u201cGo away. I don\u2019t fucking need you here. Who ever you are. Go away.\u201d Y/n warned while sniffling.</p><p>\u201cI only brought Nadine just so I can get a reaction from you.\u201d Harry said. That voice. That voice that made y/n\u2019s heart shatter, happy and all sorts of emotions.</p><p>Y/n remained still in her position. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a shitty move. Also, I don\u2019t know what I would feel if I was a bait of my fling just to get back to her ex.\u201d Harry chuckled with that and y/n just rolled her eyes. </p><p>Y/n has a habit to roll her eyes. Like every situation ever. \u201cI can sense that you\u2019re rolling your eyes at me. Also, who says about getting back together?\u201d Y/n\u2019s eyes widened at that. In fact, no one really said about getting back together. All he said was to get a reaction from her.</p><p>Y/n hoped that Harry can\u2019t see her cheeks in a deep shade of red because of embarrassment. Good thing that the room is dark enough.</p><p>She sat up and faced him. She sniffed her nose and coughed up. Harry slowly made his way to her bed and sat down, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, y/n. That was so immature of me. I still love you. <i>I never stopped loving you, y/n.</i>\u201d</p><p>She really didn\u2019t know what to say with that. She fiddled with her fingers and heaved up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Harry. I\u2019ve been so emotionally unstable ever since my Aunt died last month and especially last 2 weeks ago when we broke up. <i>I still love you too.</i> But I don\u2019t know if I want us to be together again. I think we\u2019re better off as friends.\u201d As y/n finished her statement, Harry was already at her door and about to exit her room. \u201c<i>I won\u2019t give up on you, y/n</i>. I\u2019ll show you that what we had is still worth fighting for.\u201d</p><p>As Harry finished and exited her room, y/n sighed and slumped back on her bed staring at the ceiling. Not even realizing the single tear that fell from her eye. She closed her eyes and muttered, \u201c<i>I don\u2019t want you to give up</i>.\u201d</p><p>And maybe y/n slept a little better that night since she released all those pent up emotions inside of her.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>FUCKKKKKKKKKK.</p>",

Well, 9. Harry\u2019s fling wanted to join the movie marathon, and y/n is infuriated.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he message y/n before hand that he will bring someone in their movie marathon? What is his point? Just because they broke up two weeks ago, he wanted to make y/n jealous?</p><p>The clock striked 6pm. One by one of their friends would arrive and y/n would answer the door.</p><p>\u201cOh! Come on in. There are wine and cheese platter in the kitchen. There are beers inside the fridge and snacks in the cupboard. Just help yourself.\u201d y/n called out to their friends as she answered the door.</p><p>Before she could face the person who she opened the door for, she was enveloped into a hug and the familiar scent made her head dizzy. \u201cHello. I missed you.\u201d Harry said to her. Y/n hummed and untangled herself from the hug.</p><p>Harry was smiling. Like really smiling. His dimples were out and about. Standing beside him was a beautiful and petite girl. And y/n didn\u2019t realize that she was staring at her and their entwined hands. When Harry saw on what she was staring, he cleared his throat and that made y/n come back to her senses, \u201cFuck. I\u2019m so rude for staring. I\u2019m y/n, Harry\u2019s e- I mean, friend.\u201d She said smiling at her and brought her hand forward awaiting Harry\u2019s companion to introduce herself, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m Nadine.\u201d The girl replied and shook her hand.</p><p>She smiled and stepped to the side to let them in.</p><p>All smile and eyes twinkling was the thing that you can see on y/n, but inside, she was screaming her head off and breaking into pieces.</p><p>When everyone was complete and is already situated in her living room, y/n took the popcorn and mozzarella sticks to the living room to get the movie marathon started.</p><p>\u201cKent? Will you do the honors to present me the genre bowl for tonight? So we would know what genre of movie that we\u2019re going to watch.\u201d Their friend Kent stood up and took the glass bowl filled with folded papers that contained movie genres of all sorts and stood beside y/n. \u201cHere. Take one.\u201d Y/n took a piece of paper and unfolded it. As she was unfolding it, she saw Harry and Nadine all cuddled up on the sofa and not paying attention to what\u2019s happening in front of them.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck. Great! It\u2019s Horror. Can I choose something else?\u201d Y/n sighed. She\u2019s not a fan of horror movies at ALL. One time, when they had chosen Horror as the genre of film that they\u2019ll be watching in their friend Leah\u2019s apartment, y/n forced everyone to sleep in one bedroom with all the lights on. She was THAT terrified.</p><p>That\u2019s why she was unsure of this genre that she had picked. \u201cNope! We\u2019ve been watching Comedy and Romance way too long. Like four movie marathons in a row. Horror is a breathe of fresh air.\u201d Kent said as y/n\u2019s shoulder slumped with his statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just get on with it, I guess.\u201d Y/n replied, still sad and truly horrified on what\u2019s about to happen in tonight\u2019s movie marathon.</p><p>Y/n went to her iPad and connected to the Apple TV so that they can watch it on Netflix. Y/n didn\u2019t know this kind of stuff. Harry gave the Apple TV as a present, and she hadn\u2019t used it only if needed to.</p><p>Leah saw that she was struggling connecting the iPad to the Apple TV, so she threw a pillow in Harry\u2019s direction. Which he was still flirting with Nadine. \u201cOi, mate! Help y/n with the setup and stop sucking each other\u2019s faces. Jeez!\u201d Harry rolled his eyes at Leah and mocked her.

I\u2019m Nadine.\u201d The girl replied and shook her hand.</p><p>She smiled and stepped to the side to let them in.</p><p>All smile and eyes twinkling was the thing that you can see on y/n, but inside, she was screaming her head off and breaking into pieces.</p><p>When everyone was complete and is already situated in her living room, y/n took the popcorn and mozzarella sticks to the living room to get the movie marathon started.</p><p>\u201cKent? Will you do the honors to present me the genre bowl for tonight? So we would know what genre of movie that we\u2019re going to watch.\u201d Their friend Kent stood up and took the glass bowl filled with folded papers that contained movie genres of all sorts and stood beside y/n. \u201cHere. Take one.\u201d Y/n took a piece of paper and unfolded it. As she was unfolding it, she saw Harry and Nadine all cuddled up on the sofa and not paying attention to what\u2019s happening in front of them.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck. Great! It\u2019s Horror. Can I choose something else?\u201d Y/n sighed. She\u2019s not a fan of horror movies at ALL. One time, when they had chosen Horror as the genre of film that they\u2019ll be watching in their friend Leah\u2019s apartment, y/n forced everyone to sleep in one bedroom with all the lights on. She was THAT terrified.</p><p>That\u2019s why she was unsure of this genre that she had picked. \u201cNope! We\u2019ve been watching Comedy and Romance way too long. Like four movie marathons in a row. Horror is a breathe of fresh air.\u201d Kent said as y/n\u2019s shoulder slumped with his statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just get on with it, I guess.\u201d Y/n replied, still sad and truly horrified on what\u2019s about to happen in tonight\u2019s movie marathon.</p><p>Y/n went to her iPad and connected to the Apple TV so that they can watch it on Netflix. Y/n didn\u2019t know this kind of stuff. Harry gave the Apple TV as a present, and she hadn\u2019t used it only if needed to.</p><p>Leah saw that she was struggling connecting the iPad to the Apple TV, so she threw a pillow in Harry\u2019s direction. Which he was still flirting with Nadine. \u201cOi, mate! Help y/n with the setup and stop sucking each other\u2019s faces. Jeez!\u201d Harry rolled his eyes at Leah and mocked her. He untangled himself from Nadine and kissed her temple as he stood up to help y/n.</p><p>Y/n handed her iPad to Harry, and he took it. Within 2 minutes, the iPad was already connected, and Harry gave it back to y/n.</p><p>Y/n thanked Harry, and he smiled back at her. Y/n turned around from them and made a gagging gesture. </p><p>Y/n picked \u201cThe Nun\u201d and sat down beside the two love birds. She just rolled her eyes and munch on the popcorn as she was intently watching the movie and trying not to flinch or scream that much because there is no one there to hold her. She felt a tap on her shoulder, and that made her scream out loud and made a mess from her popcorn bowl.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! I\u2019m so sorry, Y/N. I just wanted to ask you if are there any more beers in the fridge? Nadine wanted some.\u201d Harry said hurriedly. Y/n was clutching her chest at the moment and heaving out loud. \u201cYou fucker! You could\u2019ve called me and not tap my shoulder. And to answer your question, no. There aren\u2019t any more beers in the fridge. I only bought eight cans.\u201d Y/N hit Harry\u2019s arm and diverted her gaze back to the movie. </p><p>Harry snickered and slumped back to the couch, \u201cHere, baby. Just drink mine. I\u2019ll just go get some water for us.\u201d He said while holding his beer out to Nadine. He stood up and shrugged out the popcorn kernels from his jeans and went to the kitchen. </p><p>Y/n just rolled her eyes again.<i> \u201cWho the fuck does he think he is? Making me jealous and calling her fling \u2018baby\u2019? All he ever called \u2018baby\u2019 was me! Okay, I know we broke up, but that was his type of endearment to me!\u201d</i> Having a monologue inside her brain. Y/N had a frown etched on her face while watching the movie. Not that interested and scared anymore with the movie ever since Harry called Nadine \u201cbaby.\u201d</p><p>Harry came back with two bottles of water in hand and gave the other one to Nadine. \u201cThanks, bub.\u201d Nadine cooed at Harry and kissed his cheeks. And y/n still had a frown on her face.</p><p>As the movie progresses, y/n was already bored of it and not interested in it. Since she knew that Taissa Farmiga was in the movie because apparently, Taissa was too pretty and cute for Y/N that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t terrified anymore. </p><p>She was playing a game on her phone when she felt someone kicking her sides. When she glanced beside her, Nadine was already laying down the sofa, and her head was on Harry\u2019s lap.</p><p>Y/n groaned and brushed off Nadine\u2019s leg which caught their attention. Y/n just looked at them and raised her eyebrows. Gesturing at Nadine\u2019s feet nudging her. Nadine smiled and said a soft \u201csorry\u201d to her. Y/n nodded and returned playing on her phone.</p><p>After a few minutes while she was already in Level 168 of Happy Glass when she lost grip on her phone due to someone\u2019s foot colliding with her phone screen.</p><p>She stood up and paused the movie. Earning a few groans from their friends. She flicked on the light switch of her living room only to see Harry and Nadine full on snogging.</p><p>Y/n\u2019s eyes went wide with what she saw and heard a few gasps behind her. She saw Nadine\u2019s water bottle on the table, she opened it and threw the contents of the bottle to them.</p><p>\u201cWHAT THE FUCK!\u201d Harry yelled, abruptly standing up which resulted to Nadine falling off the couch. \u201cOW! HARRY!\u201d Nadine moaned while clutching her arm. \u201cOh, fuck! I\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d Harry immediately rushed to her side and helped her sat down the sofa.</p><p>And that statement, made y/n lose her mind. \u201cBABY? Are you fucking kidding me?\u201d Y/n yelled at the top of her lungs. Making everyone go silent. Only y/n\u2019s breathing will be heard. Harry and Nadine looked small in y/n\u2019s gaze. Only if looks could kill, they\u2019d be dead for sure.</p><p>Leah ran to y/n\u2019s side and rubbed her back and whispered, \u201cCalm down, y/n. <i>You\u2019re better than this. </i>Don\u2019t do it.\u201d That made y/n tear up. A tear after another and  another fell down y/n\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I didn\u2019t complained to you when you said you were going to have a plus one in this movie marathon and you didn\u2019t informed me in advance. Second, you weren\u2019t paying attention to the movie and to me while I was infront. And thirdly, I am deeply hurt. You\u2019re already moved on even tho we\u2019ve only broken up 2 weeks ago.\u201d After that outburst, y/n ran to her room and locked herself there. </p><p>Knock and screams is the only thing that is consuming the apartment. Apart from blaming Harry to all of this. She can hear their friends going to the other room to sleep or to just talk to each other of what just happened to y/n.</p><p>Y/n was laying on her bed facing the wall and she heard a click on her door knob and a silhouette came in view from her wall. \u201cGo away. I don\u2019t fucking need you here. Who ever you are. Go away.\u201d Y/n warned while sniffling.</p><p>\u201cI only brought Nadine just so I can get a reaction from you.\u201d Harry said. That voice. That voice that made y/n\u2019s heart shatter, happy and all sorts of emotions.</p><p>Y/n remained still in her position. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a shitty move. Also, I don\u2019t know what I would feel if I was a bait of my fling just to get back to her ex.\u201d Harry chuckled with that and y/n just rolled her eyes. </p><p>Y/n has a habit to roll her eyes. Like every situation ever. \u201cI can sense that you\u2019re rolling your eyes at me. Also, who says about getting back together?\u201d Y/n\u2019s eyes widened at that. In fact, no one really said about getting back together. All he said was to get a reaction from her.</p><p>Y/n hoped that Harry can\u2019t see her cheeks in a deep shade of red because of embarrassment. Good thing that the room is dark enough.</p><p>She sat up and faced him. She sniffed her nose and coughed up. Harry slowly made his way to her bed and sat down, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, y/n. That was so immature of me. I still love you. <i>I never stopped loving you, y/n.</i>\u201d</p><p>She really didn\u2019t know what to say with that. She fiddled with her fingers and heaved up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Harry. I\u2019ve been so emotionally unstable ever since my Aunt died last month and especially last 2 weeks ago when we broke up. <i>I still love you too.</i> But I don\u2019t know if I want us to be together again. I think we\u2019re better off as friends.\u201d As y/n finished her statement, Harry was already at her door and about to exit her room. \u201c<i>I won\u2019t give up on you, y/n</i>. I\u2019ll show you that what we had is still worth fighting for.\u201d</p><p>As Harry finished and exited her room, y/n sighed and slumped back on her bed staring at the ceiling. Not even realizing the single tear that fell from her eye. She closed her eyes and muttered, \u201c<i>I don\u2019t want you to give up</i>.\u201d</p><p>And maybe y/n slept a little better that night since she released all those pent up emotions inside of her.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>FUCKKKKKKKKKK.</p></p>",

What is his point? Just because they broke up two weeks ago, he wanted to make y/n jealous?</p><p>The clock striked 6pm.
