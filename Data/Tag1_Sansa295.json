Mind you, a lot of awful shit has happened to Jon in the past seven seasons of Game of Thrones but Jon has NEVER reacted so violently to anyone else in the show! There is literally no previous scene that you can compare his rage too. When that scene came out and after season 7 aired there were a lot of people who were not only upset about the writing in season 7, but specifically upset about that particular scene with Jon. Many believed that Jon\u2019s reaction to Littlefinger was so out of character and that it didn\u2019t make sense for Jon to react so violently to Littlefinger. Also many people thought it was an injustice to Littlefinger. For a character as smart and strategic as he was people couldn\u2019t wrap their mind around why he would blantanly provoke Jon and reveal his feelings for Sansa. They couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to accomplish.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ladyandtheghost:MA1Kre0_RQH0U_q4y-PIBg:ZIr4Nd2OADeBT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b22df289cab8935f510dc0feeb480065/tumblr_otm5ctK5jE1wv7r96o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>The funny thing is that the criticism this scene has received is ABSOLUTELY VALID! Yes, Jon is protective of Sansa but based on the Jon we\u2019ve seen in the show, his reaction was abnormal and extremely out of character. Also Littlefinger isn\u2019t usually so blatant with his manipulations and emotions. He\u2019s usually pretty tactful. With that being said, that\u2019s why I think this scene was the biggest tell-tale sign that Jon has deeper feelings for Sansa than he realizes. Make no mistake, the crypt scene was not filler for season 7! Littlefinger wasn\u2019t just \u201cpoking the bear\u201d for no reason. I believe that scene was created to further push this story along to where it will eventually lead. The purpose of that scene wasn\u2019t to highlight the danger/threat of Littlefinger to Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship. We knew Littlefinger was a threat from season 6. The purpose of this scene was to <b>REVEAL</b> feelings/weaknesses hidden underneath the surface. Jon\u2019s violent reaction was the entire point of that scene. It was something that we as an audience were immediately supposed to take notice of. </p><p>Another point that I want to mention is this. In the history of this show have you ever seen Littlefinger look confused?! Have you ever seen him look bewildered like he didn\u2019t know what just happened? His excecution aside, Littlefinger has definitely been caught off guard before but he\u2019s never had a look of confusion. He usually has the upper hand in scenes often manipulating the individual he\u2019s speaking to and privy to their secrets. But this time around in this particular scene that wasn\u2019t the case. For the first time Littlefinger seems dumbfounded by the events that occurred until \u201csomething\u201d dawns on him and he stares at Sansa.</p>",

Mind you, a lot of awful shit has happened to Jon in the past seven seasons of Game of Thrones but Jon has NEVER reacted so violently to anyone else in the show! There is literally no previous scene that you can compare his rage too. When that scene came out and after season 7 aired there were a lot of people who were not only upset about the writing in season 7, but specifically upset about that particular scene with Jon. Many believed that Jon\u2019s reaction to Littlefinger was so out of character and that it didn\u2019t make sense for Jon to react so violently to Littlefinger. Also many people thought it was an injustice to Littlefinger. For a character as smart and strategic as he was people couldn\u2019t wrap their mind around why he would blantanly provoke Jon and reveal his feelings for Sansa. They couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to accomplish.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ladyandtheghost:MA1Kre0_RQH0U_q4y-PIBg:ZIr4Nd2OADeBT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b22df289cab8935f510dc0feeb480065/tumblr_otm5ctK5jE1wv7r96o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>The funny thing is that the criticism this scene has received is ABSOLUTELY VALID! Yes, Jon is protective of Sansa but based on the Jon we\u2019ve seen in the show, his reaction was abnormal and extremely out of character. Also Littlefinger isn\u2019t usually so blatant with his manipulations and emotions. He\u2019s usually pretty tactful. With that being said, that\u2019s why I think this scene was the biggest tell-tale sign that Jon has deeper feelings for Sansa than he realizes. Make no mistake, the crypt scene was not filler for season 7! Littlefinger wasn\u2019t just \u201cpoking the bear\u201d for no reason. I believe that scene was created to further push this story along to where it will eventually lead. The purpose of that scene wasn\u2019t to highlight the danger/threat of Littlefinger to Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship. We knew Littlefinger was a threat from season 6. The purpose of this scene was to <b>REVEAL</b> feelings/weaknesses hidden underneath the surface. Jon\u2019s violent reaction was the entire point of that scene. It was something that we as an audience were immediately supposed to take notice of. </p><p>Another point that I want to mention is this. In the history of this show have you ever seen Littlefinger look confused?! Have you ever seen him look bewildered like he didn\u2019t know what just happened? His excecution aside, Littlefinger has definitely been caught off guard before but he\u2019s never had a look of confusion. He usually has the upper hand in scenes often manipulating the individual he\u2019s speaking to and privy to their secrets. But this time around in this particular scene that wasn\u2019t the case. For the first time Littlefinger seems dumbfounded by the events that occurred until \u201csomething\u201d dawns on him and he stares at Sansa.</p>",
