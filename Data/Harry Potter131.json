She lost her total vision, but still heared the classmates talkings so she know she isn&rsquo;t separated from them.\n</p><p>\nShe lost her eyes. Her vison. How in the possible way could she make it less scary?!\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;It is okay Kendra&rdquo; heared the teacher &ldquo;you are okay. It is only a boggart - what do you see?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; said Kendra by a shaing voice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see nothing at all&hellip;!&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;But here it is this big thing&rdquo; said one other classmate.\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;No, I mean I know. But it isn&rsquo;t the darkness. I am became totally blind&hellip;&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; got the answer. Unluckily it was from their teacher. &ldquo;Not an easy stuff right?&rdquo;\n</p><p>\nKendra felt she could start a histerical laught, but she was sure that doesn&rsquo;t help at all.\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Do not concentrate to the exact meaning of that&hellip;stuff&hellip; just try to see&hellip; oh not a good world, well imagine it as an object. It is a big fluffy pillow stuff.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Fluffy?&hellip; Oh!&hellip; Well, maybe&hellip; I think I have an idea. Riddiculus!&rdquo; said Kendra, and for a moment nothing changed. Than Kendra reached out and pulled of a piece of that stuff. It was a big pile of dark bubbles like a big bubble bath. The giant bubble wall started to came apart and became flying bubbles. Kendra started to smiling, and even laughting when a big bubble fell on her nose.\n</p><p>\nSo after all the lesson wasn&rsquo;t bad. She could think of it as she win over her fear but insted of the overhelming winner feeling, she just felt herself bad. Maybe it was better when she didn&rsquo;t know what she fears the most.</p></p>",
