But what\u2019s been really gnawing at me is the fact that for as bad as I find Sun and Moon, it\u2019s shockingly what is making Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 as far as some people see it \u2014 popular with the anime community and the general public!\u00a0  But for as positive as that is, considering that Pok\u00e9mon is something that is meant to have a wide appeal range, I can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s also at the price of loosing what made Pok\u00e9mon unique.</p><p>Allow me to explain, one of the appeals for a show like Pok\u00e9mon is that it\u2019s an escape from reality where you aren\u2019t bogged by reality where everyday you can travel across forests, mountains, deserts, oceans, and through vast cities collecting badges, meet trainers and  Pok\u00e9mon, and to me that was amazing.\u00a0 Sure the battling aspect was amazing to have, but the adventure aspect of the anime was a wonderful factor to have, on top of the small cast of characters who could have varying reactions and solutions to deal with the issues of day-to-day travel life.\u00a0 But then here comes Sun and Moon and completely messes up the formula, Ash suddenly goes from adventurer to school boy in a matter of moments, which is without a doubt one of the biggest flaws to immediately surface for the show.\u00a0 Ash in all other instances has shown that that isn\u2019t something he\u2019d want to do, most other times he\u2019s clashing with others, and generally it\u2019s clear he isn\u2019t the sort who\u2019d want that kind of life.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s the worse thing ever, but right off the bat putting Ash into school just felt like the first mistake, because by taking away the adventure aspect the show now feels as bland as every other ordinary school based show, and hell, it\u2019s only \u2018special\u2019 because  \u2014 hey viewers  \u2014  there\u2019s   Pok\u00e9mon at this school&hellip;!\u00a0 &hellip;Yeah, <i>sure</i>&hellip;I\u2019m meant to be fascinated by that?</p><p>Another annoying point I\u2019ve seen thrown about is that somehow this is making   Pok\u00e9mon \u2018better\u2019, now obviously I\u2019m aware that this is subjective to the individual who is more than welcome to their own opinion on the matter.\u00a0 But what\u2019s infuriating is when these people play these changes off as \u2018better in the long run for the whole series\u2019 just solely because it\u2019s less about battling and more about the more slice of life side of the show&hellip;but&hellip;I really question if that\u2019s beneficial.\u00a0  Pok\u00e9mon lately suffers from the most mundane filer episodes ever, people say that the filler is \u2018part of the story\u2019 but I fail to see that, characters never <i>really</i> seem to get anything out of their experiences, the reviewers make this sound like the story is continuous but I fail to see that, there aren\u2019t the connections established to make it look like anything was gained at all.\u00a0 There\u2019s no progression, and hell, barely any of supporting cast have interesting Pok\u00e9mon, let alone gags, after Marowak and Poipole none of the characters have really had a notable encounter afterwards, the likes of Mallow, Lillie, Sophocles, Lana, and Kiawe feel trapped in this void of nothingness.\u00a0 Sure Lillie has the most development but I feel she never really goes anywhere with that, and it\u2019s even harder to see her growth when she has nothing to compare it against, she\u2019s not talking over Ash\u2019s battles, she isn\u2019t catching  Pok\u00e9mon, she\u2019s just so underwhelming.\u00a0 Heck, the other characters supposedly according to one reviewer \u2018gain more growth in one episode than the original cast did in the entire series\u2019&hellip;what?\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry but is that <i>really</i> the case with Sun and Moon?</p><p>The characters aren\u2019t a group in my view, they feel more like individuals that are crowded without any real reason to get into each other\u2019s businesses, and they never really have any meaningful conversations with one another, there\u2019s never a change in them or their dynamic.\u00a0 They don\u2019t fight and make up, they don\u2019t go from acting one way to another via any particular event, there\u2019s no change in them.\u00a0 People say the OS group had trouble but at least <i>they</i> experienced change, Ash and Misty went from hating each other to inseparable, Brock went from not confident to stand up for himself to being able to take the lead in his life.\u00a0 With Sun and Moon&hellip;you really don\u2019t get that feeling, Lillie\u2019s barely shown improvement aside from touching Snowy and the others, and it\u2019s not like Sophocles is helping others out with their issues of telling the truth&hellip;heck, Mallow feels like she\u2019s experienced nothing at all so far.</p><p>Another issue is the handling of the Pok\u00e9mon&hellip;it just doesn\u2019t feel right, at all.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t the whole crux of having  Pok\u00e9mon is to have partners who can grow to be strong and have their own quirks?\u00a0 Hell, remember when Togedemaru seemingly had a thing for Pikachu?\u00a0 I <i>miss</i> that now that I remember it was a thing, sure at first I hated it (btw, as of the dubbed Marowak vs. Electivire episode, that has returned) because it kept popping up and ruining the stories flow, but heck, even that every few episodes wouldn\u2019t be bad because these days it\u2019s as if Ash\u2019s  Pok\u00e9mon don\u2019t have any developed relationships among themselves or with any of the others.\u00a0 It never feels like there\u2019s anything going on, they feel generic, they don\u2019t have enough interactions with each other because we seem too focused on Ash and co. instead of equal Pok\u00e9mon and human moments in the past.</p><p>Another thing about the Pok\u00e9mon anime is the inconsistent idea that Ash is trying to be the best, I\u2019m sorry but Gladion is hard to process as a rival, aside from being strong, there\u2019s not a lot that seems to be driving Ash to call Gladion his rival.  Gladion isn\u2019t Gary who Ash just hates because of personal reasons, Gladion isn\u2019t Paul who Ash is trying to prove a point to, and Gladion isn\u2019t even Sawyer, who for as much as I hate, was at least someone tat Ash was showing off too, heck Misty wanted Ash to get stronger&hellip;but here in Alola it feels like he\u2019s just goofing around with no one trying to make him improve.\u00a0 In other series Ash was always seen battling his friends and rivals to get better, his Pok\u00e9mon sparred against each other whilst others watched and cheered, but here there\u2019s something extremely static about it, Ash never battles long enough, nor shows off any skills, instead it\u2019s just an exchange of moves without anything behind it.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m speaking into the void, but the lack of this consistent training on screen, learning new moves, maneuvers etcetera makes every battle Ash has seem&hellip;not as cool as it used to be, it\u2019s like he only trains when it\u2019s important to the plot according to a case by case importance in each episode, as opposed to the long run.\u00a0 Not only that but it\u2019s like he\u2019s not striving for victory&hellip;though maybe that\u2019s just me.\u00a0 Look, I\u2019m not asking for the return of something akin to this apparent \u2018Shojo Battling\u2019 theme like in XY, but the least they could do is give us back the relevance of what it means to train strong Pok\u00e9mon like say in OS-DP.  Make the training look good, and show some progress, not simplistic class battling.</p><p>I just can\u2019t bring myself to say this series is good.\u00a0 With the changes they\u2019ve made, it feels like Pok\u00e9mon have alienated their older viewers who liked them back when they were more focused.\u00a0 You see one thing about content making is that, yes sure, try to appeal to a wide range, get the most viewers in, but see that\u2019s the problem, when you try to get out to a larger whole you\u2019ll always miss a few people, whereas if you actually <i>try</i> and focus on a specific cohort, you will see the most success because you are capitalizing on what that group wants, as opposed to try and reach out to everyone.\u00a0 Now I should note that I am by no means a media expert, I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend I\u2019m a veteran critic or that my words should have significant weight.\u00a0 That isn\u2019t me, I\u2019m not like other people online who act like they\u2019re experts, this is just my a collection of my opinions as a long time fan of  Pok\u00e9mon speaking out to those who are like me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t wish to invalidate anyone over their views on SM, but to me I feel alienated, the show isn\u2019t as good as it could be, there\u2019s an inferior dub, and the dynamics and direction of the show just doesn\u2019t strike me as special.</p><p>I\u2019m not asking for hyper focus, but I\u2019m asking for a more quality writing and characterization, something that actually has a cause and effect on what is happening let alone for it to be actually entertaining.\u00a0 I\u2019m not asking for it to reach the point where every episode is a must watch, but I ask for at least dynamic consistency, and a bit more entertainment value and character growth, puh-LEASE!</p><p>David, aka zedpercyfan\u2019s ramble over.\u00a0 By the way, I wrote this quite a while ago, and only now am up to publishing it.</p>",

Make the training look good, and show some progress, not simplistic class battling.</p><p>I just can\u2019t bring myself to say this series is good.\u00a0 With the changes they\u2019ve made, it feels like Pok\u00e9mon have alienated their older viewers who liked them back when they were more focused.\u00a0 You see one thing about content making is that, yes sure, try to appeal to a wide range, get the most viewers in, but see that\u2019s the problem, when you try to get out to a larger whole you\u2019ll always miss a few people, whereas if you actually <i>try</i> and focus on a specific cohort, you will see the most success because you are capitalizing on what that group wants, as opposed to try and reach out to everyone.\u00a0 Now I should note that I am by no means a media expert, I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend I\u2019m a veteran critic or that my words should have significant weight.\u00a0 That isn\u2019t me, I\u2019m not like other people online who act like they\u2019re experts, this is just my a collection of my opinions as a long time fan of  Pok\u00e9mon speaking out to those who are like me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t wish to invalidate anyone over their views on SM, but to me I feel alienated, the show isn\u2019t as good as it could be, there\u2019s an inferior dub, and the dynamics and direction of the show just doesn\u2019t strike me as special.</p><p>I\u2019m not asking for hyper focus, but I\u2019m asking for a more quality writing and characterization, something that actually has a cause and effect on what is happening let alone for it to be actually entertaining.\u00a0 I\u2019m not asking for it to reach the point where every episode is a must watch, but I ask for at least dynamic consistency, and a bit more entertainment value and character growth, puh-LEASE!</p><p>David, aka zedpercyfan\u2019s ramble over.\u00a0 By the way, I wrote this quite a while ago, and only now am up to publishing it.</p></p>",

But what\u2019s been really gnawing at me is the fact that for as bad as I find Sun and Moon, it\u2019s shockingly what is making Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 as far as some people see it \u2014 popular with the anime community and the general public!\u00a0  But for as positive as that is, considering that Pok\u00e9mon is something that is meant to have a wide appeal range, I can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s also at the price of loosing what made Pok\u00e9mon unique.</p><p>Allow me to explain, one of the appeals for a show like Pok\u00e9mon is that it\u2019s an escape from reality where you aren\u2019t bogged by reality where everyday you can travel across forests, mountains, deserts, oceans, and through vast cities collecting badges, meet trainers and  Pok\u00e9mon, and to me that was amazing.\u00a0 Sure the battling aspect was amazing to have, but the adventure aspect of the anime was a wonderful factor to have, on top of the small cast of characters who could have varying reactions and solutions to deal with the issues of day-to-day travel life.\u00a0 But then here comes Sun and Moon and completely messes up the formula, Ash suddenly goes from adventurer to school boy in a matter of moments, which is without a doubt one of the biggest flaws to immediately surface for the show.\u00a0 Ash in all other instances has shown that that isn\u2019t something he\u2019d want to do, most other times he\u2019s clashing with others, and generally it\u2019s clear he isn\u2019t the sort who\u2019d want that kind of life.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s the worse thing ever, but right off the bat putting Ash into school just felt like the first mistake, because by taking away the adventure aspect the show now feels as bland as every other ordinary school based show, and hell, it\u2019s only \u2018special\u2019 because  \u2014 hey viewers  \u2014  there\u2019s   Pok\u00e9mon at this school\u2026!\u00a0 \u2026Yeah, <i>sure</i>\u2026I\u2019m meant to be fascinated by that?</p><p>Another annoying point I\u2019ve seen thrown about is that somehow this is making   Pok\u00e9mon \u2018better\u2019, now obviously I\u2019m aware that this is subjective to the individual who is more than welcome to their own opinion on the matter.\u00a0 But what\u2019s infuriating is when these people play these changes off as \u2018better in the long run for the whole series\u2019 just solely because it\u2019s less about battling and more about the more slice of life side of the show\u2026but\u2026I really question if that\u2019s beneficial.\u00a0  Pok\u00e9mon lately suffers from the most mundane filer episodes ever, people say that the filler is \u2018part of the story\u2019 but I fail to see that, characters never <i>really</i> seem to get anything out of their experiences, the reviewers make this sound like the story is continuous but I fail to see that, there aren\u2019t the connections established to make it look like anything was gained at all.\u00a0 There\u2019s no progression, and hell, barely any of supporting cast have interesting Pok\u00e9mon, let alone gags, after Marowak and Poipole none of the characters have really had a notable encounter afterwards, the likes of Mallow, Lillie, Sophocles, Lana, and Kiawe feel trapped in this void of nothingness.\u00a0 Sure Lillie has the most development but I feel she never really goes anywhere with that, and it\u2019s even harder to see her growth when she has nothing to compare it against, she\u2019s not talking over Ash\u2019s battles, she isn\u2019t catching  Pok\u00e9mon, she\u2019s just so underwhelming.\u00a0 Heck, the other characters supposedly according to one reviewer \u2018gain more growth in one episode than the original cast did in the entire series\u2019\u2026what?\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry but is that <i>really</i> the case with Sun and Moon?</p><p>The characters aren\u2019t a group in my view, they feel more like individuals that are crowded without any real reason to get into each other\u2019s businesses, and they never really have any meaningful conversations with one another, there\u2019s never a change in them or their dynamic.\u00a0 They don\u2019t fight and make up, they don\u2019t go from acting one way to another via any particular event, there\u2019s no change in them.\u00a0 People say the OS group had trouble but at least <i>they</i> experienced change, Ash and Misty went from hating each other to inseparable, Brock went from not confident to stand up for himself to being able to take the lead in his life.\u00a0 With Sun and Moon\u2026you really don\u2019t get that feeling, Lillie\u2019s barely shown improvement aside from touching Snowy and the others, and it\u2019s not like Sophocles is helping others out with their issues of telling the truth\u2026heck, Mallow feels like she\u2019s experienced nothing at all so far.</p><p>Another issue is the handling of the Pok\u00e9mon\u2026it just doesn\u2019t feel right, at all.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t the whole crux of having  Pok\u00e9mon is to have partners who can grow to be strong and have their own quirks?\u00a0 Hell, remember when Togedemaru seemingly had a thing for Pikachu?\u00a0 I <i>miss</i> that now that I remember it was a thing, sure at first I hated it (btw, as of the dubbed Marowak vs. Electivire episode, that has returned) because it kept popping up and ruining the stories flow, but heck, even that every few episodes wouldn\u2019t be bad because these days it\u2019s as if Ash\u2019s  Pok\u00e9mon don\u2019t have any developed relationships among themselves or with any of the others.\u00a0 It never feels like there\u2019s anything going on, they feel generic, they don\u2019t have enough interactions with each other because we seem too focused on Ash and co. instead of equal Pok\u00e9mon and human moments in the past.</p><p>Another thing about the Pok\u00e9mon anime is the inconsistent idea that Ash is trying to be the best, I\u2019m sorry but Gladion is hard to process as a rival, aside from being strong, there\u2019s not a lot that seems to be driving Ash to call Gladion his rival.  Gladion isn\u2019t Gary who Ash just hates because of personal reasons, Gladion isn\u2019t Paul who Ash is trying to prove a point to, and Gladion isn\u2019t even Sawyer, who for as much as I hate, was at least someone tat Ash was showing off too, heck Misty wanted Ash to get stronger\u2026but here in Alola it feels like he\u2019s just goofing around with no one trying to make him improve.\u00a0 In other series Ash was always seen battling his friends and rivals to get better, his Pok\u00e9mon sparred against each other whilst others watched and cheered, but here there\u2019s something extremely static about it, Ash never battles long enough, nor shows off any skills, instead it\u2019s just an exchange of moves without anything behind it.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019m speaking into the void, but the lack of this consistent training on screen, learning new moves, maneuvers etcetera makes every battle Ash has seem\u2026not as cool as it used to be, it\u2019s like he only trains when it\u2019s important to the plot according to a case by case importance in each episode, as opposed to the long run.\u00a0 Not only that but it\u2019s like he\u2019s not striving for victory\u2026though maybe that\u2019s just me.\u00a0 Look, I\u2019m not asking for the return of something akin to this apparent \u2018Shojo Battling\u2019 theme like in XY, but the least they could do is give us back the relevance of what it means to train strong Pok\u00e9mon like say in OS-DP.  Make the training look good, and show some progress, not simplistic class battling.</p><p>I just can\u2019t bring myself to say this series is good.\u00a0 With the changes they\u2019ve made, it feels like Pok\u00e9mon have alienated their older viewers who liked them back when they were more focused.\u00a0 You see one thing about content making is that, yes sure, try to appeal to a wide range, get the most viewers in, but see that\u2019s the problem, when you try to get out to a larger whole you\u2019ll always miss a few people, whereas if you actually <i>try</i> and focus on a specific cohort, you will see the most success because you are capitalizing on what that group wants, as opposed to try and reach out to everyone.\u00a0 Now I should note that I am by no means a media expert, I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend I\u2019m a veteran critic or that my words should have significant weight.\u00a0 That isn\u2019t me, I\u2019m not like other people online who act like they\u2019re experts, this is just my a collection of my opinions as a long time fan of  Pok\u00e9mon speaking out to those who are like me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t wish to invalidate anyone over their views on SM, but to me I feel alienated, the show isn\u2019t as good as it could be, there\u2019s an inferior dub, and the dynamics and direction of the show just doesn\u2019t strike me as special.</p><p>I\u2019m not asking for hyper focus, but I\u2019m asking for a more quality writing and characterization, something that actually has a cause and effect on what is happening let alone for it to be actually entertaining.\u00a0 I\u2019m not asking for it to reach the point where every episode is a must watch, but I ask for at least dynamic consistency, and a bit more entertainment value and character growth, puh-LEASE!</p><p>David, aka zedpercyfan\u2019s ramble over.\u00a0 By the way, I wrote this quite a while ago, and only now am up to publishing it.</p></p>",
