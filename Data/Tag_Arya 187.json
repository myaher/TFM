She\u2019s in protective mode, and that will make it easier for her to read the new arrivals. And if Jon\u2019s instinct is to pay a visit to the crypts, perhaps she could seek him out there. A private reunion would make sense for them. I think they both would appreciate that. It would make it easier for them to be honest with one another too.</p><p>It would also be great for the viewers. We\u2019ve anticipated their reunion for years, and it would be really rewarding for us if that moment was just about them. No distractions, no onlookers, just Jon and Arya.</p><p>And Bran? Yeah, he might sit in his room or by the heart-tree and have Jon come to him. He\u2019s not exactly a sociable person who cares about decorum at the moment, so I could see him not caring to line up with the rest of them to greet the Queen. And, like with Arya, it could be nice for the audience to get a quiet Jon/Bran scene instead of a long moment of Jon going from one person to another. That could easily become tedious and busy.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

I mentioned before\nthat I believe the fact Arya named her wolf Nymeria to be a big hint about her\nfuture as a queen. </p><blockquote><p>Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as\nArya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the sunlight, they\ngleamed like two golden coins. <b>Arya had\nnamed her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across\nthe narrow sea.</b> That had been a great scandal too. </p><p><b>A\nGame of Thrones - Arya I</b></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>He was still trying to decide on a\nname. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa had named\nhers Lady, and <b>Arya named hers after\nsome old witch queen in the songs</b>&hellip;.</p><p><b>A\nGame of Thrones - Bran II</b></p></blockquote><p>And in \nA FEAST FOR CROWS when Arya is forced on invent a story for &ldquo;CAT&rdquo; the\nnew character she is pretending to be, she chooses Nymeria as the name of the\nship who brought her to Braavos. I thought it was &nbsp;interesting that a &nbsp;&ldquo;Queen&rdquo; is taking her to Braavos where she is\nreceiving her education in the Game of Faces&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Just so. Your father was\noarmaster on a galley. When your mother died, he took you off to sea with him.\nThen he died as well, and his captain had no use for you, so he put you off the\nship in Braavos. And what was the name of the ship?&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;Nymeria,&rdquo;\nshe said at once.</b></p><p><b>A\nFeast for Crows - Arya II</b></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7f0933835d059d67bcd1ba79e8edb4bc/tumblr_inline_pk5qjbt6rZ1sgp768_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b></b></p>(art by Karla Ortiz)<br /><br /><p><b>NYMERIA THE QUEEN&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</b></p><p>According to A WIKI OF ICE AND FIRE,\nNymerias was described as a witch queen, which is very interesting since Arya\ndoes have magic in her storyline as a Faceless Men assassin.

A septa has\ninstructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to\nunderstand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in\nrivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish\nand cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be\nhunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon\nknows kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and\nrule for them.&rdquo;</p><p>(EPILOGUE) ADWD</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Now, lets pay attention in the way Varys described Prince Aegon and the points he mentions that makes for a good king in his idea&hellip;..</p><p><br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;He\nreads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and\npoetry&rdquo;&hellip;..</b></p><p>Arya was born in Winterfell and\nreceived a proper High born Lady education.

Sansa would not remove herself from that obligation. Maybe she tricks Arya a little? Arya hits Sansa during their lesson and Sansa pretends to be hurt worse than she is. Arya starts to apologize and Sansa pushes her down. Sansa makes a point to Arya about Cersei and how tricky and manipulative she is.
