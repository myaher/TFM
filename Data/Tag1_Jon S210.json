Tyrion\u2019s statement itself</h2><h2>2. The denial of Dany\u2019s natural intuition </h2><h2>3. The implication that Tyrion\u2019s statement is ridiculous </h2><p><b>1</b>. For my first point let me just make my opinion clear. There is <b>No Reason</b> for the show to sarcastically allude to Jon Snow having political motivations for his actions unless that\u2019s actually the case!! None! I\u2019ve wrapped my mind around it so many times trying to come up with a logical explanation for why the show writers would have Tyrion say this line and I can think of no other reason except for Political Jon. </p><p>To be honest if this moment wasn\u2019t included in season 7 I would be less inclined to believe  Political Jon and probably would have just believed that the acting and writing was subpar but thing is it was and that for me makes me do a double take. The line itself is random and it\u2019s a weird way to assure someone that someone else has feelings for them. Especially in a season where they are trying to build up this \u201cromance\u201d and most of the general audience aren\u2019t questioning the legitimacy of it. In short, it\u2019s an out of place thing to say. The show writers could have easily had Tyrion say something along the lines of \u201che wouldn\u2019t be staring at you longingly if he wasn\u2019t in love with you\u201d and the same point would have been made, but they took Tyrion\u2019s line a step further and sarcastically joked that Jon\u2019s intentions are political and to me that is suspect! </p><p>Also, has anyone noticed how in previous seasons many characters have said random things that are extremely specific and those things end up coming to pass?! 99% of the time the GA completely miss these lines or pass it off as something random and unimportant but these lines are the very things that happen in the next season of the show! I think this statement said by Tyrion falls under this same category. It\u2019s to on the nose not too.</p><p><b>2</b>. My second point is the most important point I want to bring up in this meta and I feel like it hasn\u2019t been talked about yet. When Tyrion claims that Jon is in love with her, Dany\u2019s IMMEDIATE reaction is to deny that Jon loves her because SHE CAN TELL that he\u2019s not. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not saying that Dany doesn\u2019t want Jon to be in love with her. At this point she is totally and completely into him, but what I\u2019m saying is that Dany is aware that Jon doesn\u2019t feel the same way. I don\u2019t know what it is but as a woman you can just tell when a guy is into you. It\u2019s like a sixth sense that\u2019s been instilled in women from the beginning of time. You Just Know! I know a lot of people give Daenerys flack for being self absorbed but this isn\u2019t her first rodeo and Dany has had enough experience to know when a guy is in love with her/ into her. Obviously her opinion on this changes later on in the season, but at this particular moment  I think her God given woman intuition is kicking in here and in her gut she knows that Jon isn\u2019t into her.</p><h2>The main reason why I believe this is because of this previous scene:</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfc5531b29b156eeeab13e190d27c9a/tumblr_pj0rh49v2s1v81iri_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/39bb3c29c50482d1d132c4d3ad58394e/tumblr_pj0t86aZLB1v81iri_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>I don\u2019t know how people get this confused but the SOLE purpose of the beach scene was to display the feelings Jon and Daenerys have for each other. That\u2019s it. For Daenerys it\u2019s clear as day that she\u2019s in love/falling in love with Jon Snow. As he departs Dragonstone, her eyes never leave him. As she watches him take off in his boat you best believe that she is praying on the inside that he turns back around to look at her. He\u2019s heading off to danger and she might never see him again but if he turns around to look at her at least she can know that he might possibly have feelings for her too, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead Jorah, the guy who is desperately in love with her but she\u2019s not that into, turns around and by the look of her face she is deeply disappointed. I 100% believe that this moment on the beach was the setup for why Daenerys denied that Jon was in love with her in her conversation with Tyrion. She witnessed it with her own eyes and clearly saw the difference in behavior between someone who\u2019s in love with you and someone who isn\u2019t. So when she denies what Tyrion says, I truly believe she is trusting her gut/instincts and she\u2019s spot on! </p><p>The placement of these scenes weren\u2019t done by accident and I believe this is what the show writers wanted us to pay attention too and connect. Another important point is this. Anytime dialogue leads to someone disregarding their initial gut instincts it always a red flag! If you look back and rewatch season 7, where in the show do you see Jon staring longingly at Daenerys? Better question, where do you see Tyrion witnessing Jon longingly staring at Daenerys? For both of those questions the answer is you don\u2019t. There\u2019s not a scene that depicts either of this in the show. You know what there is a scene of though? Tyrion witnessing Dany longingly stare after Jon. But he doesn\u2019t bring that up in his conversation with her and tells her the opposite of what he saw. Maybe he assumed that because Dany has feels Jon has feels too but it\u2019s clear that any in \u201clove vibes\u201d Tyrion got from Jon, Dany didn\u2019t pick up on it at all. </p><p>Bonus: I think this scene is also one of many scenes used to set up the eventual complete break down of Tyrion and Dany\u2019s relationship. The show keeps putting Tyrion in a position where he keeps on giving Dany advice/opinions that back fire. I can easily see Dany blaming Tyrion for leading her astray or making her believe Jon\u2019s feelings were true when they weren\u2019t.</p><p><b>3</b>. Last but certainly not least I want to talk about how Tyrion\u2019s statement is implied as ridiculous. I think the show writers also did this on purpose. As an audience, they want us to think that it\u2019s ridiculous for Jon Snow to stare longingly at Daenerys for the sake of a successful military alliance when in actuality it\u2019s not ridiculous at all. They want us to get caught up and focused on the \u201csupposed romance\u201d rather than the politics so that when the truth comes out we will be caught off guard. </p><p>At the moment Tyrion said this line in the show, <b>Jon Still Hadn\u2019t Secured A Successful Military Alliance with Dany! </b> <b>The one thing he had set out to do!</b> In fact, if anything the wight hunt shows how unsuccessful he was in gaining her as an ally because he ended up going to extreme measures to convince both Dany and Cersei that the White Walkers are real. Considering that the fate of Westeros is at stake and the people who need to be on board still need convincing, It\u2019s not unreasonable to think Jon might stare at Daenerys for political reasons but it\u2019s unreasonable to think that he won\u2019t. The show is clearly trying to misdirect us here. They want us to believe that at this point Jon and Dany are already allies but that\u2019s simply not true and they also want us to forget the true purpose of why Jon came to Dragonstone in the first place which was to secure an alliance!</p><p>Am I crazy to get this much of this out of one scene?! Maybe. But when I broke things down, I truly believe this scene was more than a simple conversation and makes a strong case for Political Jon.</p>",

Tyrion\u2019s statement itself</h2><h2>2. The denial of Dany\u2019s natural intuition </h2><h2>3. The implication that Tyrion\u2019s statement is ridiculous </h2><p><b>1</b>. For my first point let me just make my opinion clear. There is <b>No Reason</b> for the show to sarcastically allude to Jon Snow having political motivations for his actions unless that\u2019s actually the case!! None! I\u2019ve wrapped my mind around it so many times trying to come up with a logical explanation for why the show writers would have Tyrion say this line and I can think of no other reason except for Political Jon. </p><p>To be honest if this moment wasn\u2019t included in season 7 I would be less inclined to believe  Political Jon and probably would have just believed that the acting and writing was subpar but thing is it was and that for me makes me do a double take. The line itself is random and it\u2019s a weird way to assure someone that someone else has feelings for them. Especially in a season where they are trying to build up this \u201cromance\u201d and most of the general audience aren\u2019t questioning the legitimacy of it. In short, it\u2019s an out of place thing to say. The show writers could have easily had Tyrion say something along the lines of \u201che wouldn\u2019t be staring at you longingly if he wasn\u2019t in love with you\u201d and the same point would have been made, but they took Tyrion\u2019s line a step further and sarcastically joked that Jon\u2019s intentions are political and to me that is suspect! </p><p>Also, has anyone noticed how in previous seasons many characters have said random things that are extremely specific and those things end up coming to pass?! 99% of the time the GA completely miss these lines or pass it off as something random and unimportant but these lines are the very things that happen in the next season of the show! I think this statement said by Tyrion falls under this same category. It\u2019s to on the nose not too.</p><p><b>2</b>. My second point is the most important point I want to bring up in this meta and I feel like it hasn\u2019t been talked about yet. When Tyrion claims that Jon is in love with her, Dany\u2019s IMMEDIATE reaction is to deny that Jon loves her because SHE CAN TELL that he\u2019s not. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not saying that Dany doesn\u2019t want Jon to be in love with her. At this point she is totally and completely into him, but what I\u2019m saying is that Dany is aware that Jon doesn\u2019t feel the same way. I don\u2019t know what it is but as a woman you can just tell when a guy is into you. It\u2019s like a sixth sense that\u2019s been instilled in women from the beginning of time. You Just Know! I know a lot of people give Daenerys flack for being self absorbed but this isn\u2019t her first rodeo and Dany has had enough experience to know when a guy is in love with her/ into her. Obviously her opinion on this changes later on in the season, but at this particular moment  I think her God given woman intuition is kicking in here and in her gut she knows that Jon isn\u2019t into her.</p><h2>The main reason why I believe this is because of this previous scene:</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dfc5531b29b156eeeab13e190d27c9a/tumblr_pj0rh49v2s1v81iri_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/39bb3c29c50482d1d132c4d3ad58394e/tumblr_pj0t86aZLB1v81iri_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"150\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p>I don\u2019t know how people get this confused but the SOLE purpose of the beach scene was to display the feelings Jon and Daenerys have for each other. That\u2019s it. For Daenerys it\u2019s clear as day that she\u2019s in love/falling in love with Jon Snow. As he departs Dragonstone, her eyes never leave him. As she watches him take off in his boat you best believe that she is praying on the inside that he turns back around to look at her. He\u2019s heading off to danger and she might never see him again but if he turns around to look at her at least she can know that he might possibly have feelings for her too, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead Jorah, the guy who is desperately in love with her but she\u2019s not that into, turns around and by the look of her face she is deeply disappointed. I 100% believe that this moment on the beach was the setup for why Daenerys denied that Jon was in love with her in her conversation with Tyrion. She witnessed it with her own eyes and clearly saw the difference in behavior between someone who\u2019s in love with you and someone who isn\u2019t. So when she denies what Tyrion says, I truly believe she is trusting her gut/instincts and she\u2019s spot on! </p><p>The placement of these scenes weren\u2019t done by accident and I believe this is what the show writers wanted us to pay attention too and connect. Another important point is this. Anytime dialogue leads to someone disregarding their initial gut instincts it always a red flag! If you look back and rewatch season 7, where in the show do you see Jon staring longingly at Daenerys? Better question, where do you see Tyrion witnessing Jon longingly staring at Daenerys? For both of those questions the answer is you don\u2019t. There\u2019s not a scene that depicts either of this in the show. You know what there is a scene of though? Tyrion witnessing Dany longingly stare after Jon. But he doesn\u2019t bring that up in his conversation with her and tells her the opposite of what he saw. Maybe he assumed that because Dany has feels Jon has feels too but it\u2019s clear that any in \u201clove vibes\u201d Tyrion got from Jon, Dany didn\u2019t pick up on it at all. </p><p>Bonus: I think this scene is also one of many scenes used to set up the eventual complete break down of Tyrion and Dany\u2019s relationship. The show keeps putting Tyrion in a position where he keeps on giving Dany advice/opinions that back fire. I can easily see Dany blaming Tyrion for leading her astray or making her believe Jon\u2019s feelings were true when they weren\u2019t.</p><p><b>3</b>. Last but certainly not least I want to talk about how Tyrion\u2019s statement is implied as ridiculous. I think the show writers also did this on purpose. As an audience, they want us to think that it\u2019s ridiculous for Jon Snow to stare longingly at Daenerys for the sake of a successful military alliance when in actuality it\u2019s not ridiculous at all. They want us to get caught up and focused on the \u201csupposed romance\u201d rather than the politics so that when the truth comes out we will be caught off guard. </p><p>At the moment Tyrion said this line in the show, <b>Jon Still Hadn\u2019t Secured A Successful Military Alliance with Dany! </b> <b>The one thing he had set out to do!</b> In fact, if anything the wight hunt shows how unsuccessful he was in gaining her as an ally because he ended up going to extreme measures to convince both Dany and Cersei that the White Walkers are real. Considering that the fate of Westeros is at stake and the people who need to be on board still need convincing, It\u2019s not unreasonable to think Jon might stare at Daenerys for political reasons but it\u2019s unreasonable to think that he won\u2019t. The show is clearly trying to misdirect us here. They want us to believe that at this point Jon and Dany are already allies but that\u2019s simply not true and they also want us to forget the true purpose of why Jon came to Dragonstone in the first place which was to secure an alliance!</p><p>Am I crazy to get this much of this out of one scene?! Maybe. But when I broke things down, I truly believe this scene was more than a simple conversation and makes a strong case for Political Jon.</p></p>",

For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair. <br/></small></p><p><small>She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. \u201cI could do just as good as Bran,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s only seven. I\u2019m nine.\u201d <br/></small></p><p><small>Jon looked her over with all his \nfourteen-year-old wisdom. \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny,\u201d he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \u201cI doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.\u201d <br/></small></p><p><small>Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and Tommen circle each other. <br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cYou see Prince Joffrey?\u201d Jon asked. <br/></small></p><p><small>She hadn\u2019t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised. <br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cLook at the arms on his surcoat,\u201d Jon suggested. <br/></small></p><p><small>Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince\u2019s padded surcoat. No doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister. <br/></small></p><p><small> \u201cThe Lannisters are proud,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cYou\u2019d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\u2019s House equal in honor to the king\u2019s.\u201d <br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cThe woman is important too!\u201d Arya protested. <br/></small></p><p><small>Jon chuckled. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed \nTully to Stark in your arms.\u201d <br/></small></p><p><small>\u201cA wolf with a fish in its mouth?\u201d It made her laugh. \u201cThat would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\u2019t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\u201d <br/></small></p><p><small>Jon shrugged. \u201cGirls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\u201d - <i>AGoT Arya I</i><br/></small></p></blockquote>",
