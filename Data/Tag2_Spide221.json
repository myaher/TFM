        "body": "<p>Sorry it took so long to post. School has been crazy and finals are coming up :/\u00a0</p><p>Also, I\u2019m probably going to rewrite part 5. I didn\u2019t really like how I wrote it, and it\u2019s been bugging me.<strike> Not sure when I\u2019ll be able to, but we\u2019ll see.</strike></p><p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy this part!\u00a0</p><p><b><a href=\"https://theprocrastinatingwriter34.tumblr.com/post/179227154442/we-found-you-master-post\">Masterpost</a></b></p><p>*~*~*</p><p> The glass building air was far colder than Eddie had expected. Even though he wore the nice topcoat Tony had let him borrow, a chill crept up is spine. The building was similar to Carlton Drake\u2019s in terms of the amount of windows and glass designs, but it had a different air to it. Drake liked to show off what he had done, but it seemed like Dr. Wendell was more modest. The clean glass windows let the grey light spill in and illuminate the white and silver office furniture. Paperwork was neatly organized at every corner and magazines were stacked perfectly in the lounge area. It was slightly off putting to see everything so clean and organized. Even the light grey tile floor seemed to be spotless. As Eddie glanced around at the people working there, he scoffed at the fact that Tony was right. Everyone there was wearing business professional attire, and Eddie would have stuck out like a sore thumb if he had worn what he had originally planned to wear. </p><!-- more --><p>As Eddie approached the front desk, he noticed the two cameramen from his work were scanning the building for someone. One of the cameraman&rsquo;s gaze fell on Eddie, and they did a double take.</p><p>\u201cDamn Eddie, we barely recognized you.\u201d the cameramen commented as Eddie walked to them. </p><p>\u201cThe boss said to dress up, so I did.\u201d Eddie replied as he shoved his hands in the topcoat pockets.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you look like you just walked out of a suit magazine.\u201d </p><p>Eddie rolled his eyes and glanced to the front desk.</p><p>\u201cCome on; I\u2019ve been told Wendell doesn\u2019t like tardiness.\u201d</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>\u201cMr. Brock, how lovely to meet you.\u201d a soft voice welcomed as Eddie stepped into the pale office. Sitting at the glass desk was a middle aged women with fair skin and piercing, ocean blue eyes. Her dark brown hair was pulled back in a tight bun and clear glasses frames sat at the bridge of her nose. </p><p>\u201cLikewise, Dr. Wendell.\u201d Eddie politely replied as he walked over to the desk. \u201cWould you like to head over to the conference room? Everything has been set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>As Eddie walked beside the tall doctor, he noticed her flats clicked like tall heels and echoed throughout the hallway. Although she seemed kind-hearted and caring, Eddie\u2019s guard was up. Drake tried to have the same facade, but he had his faults with it. Once they made it to the conference room, the two cameramen inside the room began to mess with the camera. The conference room had been emptied on one half of the room and only a small glass table and two chairs opposite from one another sat in the middle. Before the doctor continued on her path to one of the chairs, Eddie walked past her and pulled out the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, Mr. Brock.\u201d Dr. Wendell thanked as she sat down and adjusted her spotless, white lab coat. \u201c I have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect you to be the chivalrous type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found that it comes with age.\u201d Eddie replied, trying to be more formal than what he was used to. Once the cameras were ready and the welcoming,idle conversation had subsided, Eddie pulled out his small notepad along with a pen that was heavier than his usual gel pen. As he pulled it out of his pocket, he realize his pen had been replaced with a fancier pen that had black and gold designs on it. A small, yellow sticky note was attached to it and read: <i>\u201cYou are <b>not</b> using a cheap old pen for this. Just give it back once your done. - TS.\u201d </i></p><p>Eddie smirked and put the sticky note back in his pocket and twisted the pen open.</p><p>\u201cSo, Dr. Wendell, how have you been since the incident involving Carlton Drake?\u201d Eddie questioned as he flipped open his notepad. </p><p>\u201cThe company has been alright, but I, personally, have been upset at him.\u201d the doctor began. \u201cI cannot believe I worked with such a horrid man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you and Drake work on?\u201d </p><p>The doctor\u2019s eyes glaze drifted to the side as she sighed. </p><p>\u201cOne of our main projects was a STEM cell research experiment, but he stopped working with me once he found a cure for cancer. I wanted to continue finding cures for other diseases, but he had other plans in mind.\u201d She explained as she pushed her glasses up. </p><p>Eddie glanced down at his list of notes and quietly calculated which one would be best to ask next. Although he had done numerous interviews and meetings with well known people, this one gave him the most nerves. He knew if he messed this meeting up, he couldn\u2019t come back from it. Finding and investigating his own stories in California was a walk in the park compared to now. With this investigation, he had to plan out everything to make sure if something failed, he already had a plan B. </p><p>\u201cDid you or Drake ever become competitive with each other? I know both of you had butted heads with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Mr. Stark is a smart man, there was no way he could compete with our work.\u201d Dr. Wendell half-scoffed; her voice almost cold. \u201cDrake and I did have a falling out, but our only competition was to find cures for illnesses.\u201d</p><p>She fiddled with one of the opaque, white buttons on her lab coat.</p><p>\u201cI understand you are trying to get answers for his actions, but I\u2019m having trouble understanding why I would be a person of interest.\u201d she added. </p><p>\u201cYou are one of the closest people he worked with. Everyone is dying to get their hands on his research with the samples he brought from space.\u201d Eddie replied, choosing his response carefully. Her dark brown eyebrows furrowed as fought a glare.</p><p>\u201cI would never agree to work with those <i>things</i>.\u201d She spat, and Eddie felt the symbiote stirr angrily in his chest, but they stayed quiet. \u201cI may have been a friend to Mr. Drake, but he is a monster for killing people and using them as test subjects for a selfish cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you believe he should have done with his resources?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life has been dedicated to finding the best way to heal people. Mr. Drake had all the resources to continue our research in defeating diseases that have wiped out thousands, but he chose to move his research to space. Same goes for Mr. Stark. He could have helped with developing better prosthetics; Instead, he developed weapons and suits of armor.\u201d</p><p>The cold air Eddie felt when he had walked into the building seemed colder now. </p><p><i>\u201cEddie.\u201d</i> Venom whispered. Eddie was about to scold the symbiote mentally, but he halted. They knew not to talk during meetings and interviews, so it had to be important. <i>\u201cSomething\u2019s not right. We do not trust her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>But she cares about people\u2019s lives and advancing medicine.</i> Eddie countered internally.</p><p><i>\u201cDidn\u2019t Drake say the same thing?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMr. Drake seemed to have forgotten how special human lives are and how they can advance research.\u201d Dr. Wendell continued with a sigh, as if to cool off her building anger. \u201cHe may have cured cancer, but he won\u2019t find cures to other deadly diseases floating around in space. I\u2019m sure the answers are all here on earth.\u201d</p><p>Although the doctor\u2019s answer seemed sincere and kind, something about it sat wrong in Eddie. She was hinting something, but she wasn\u2019t going to state it; especially not in front of cameras.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you say that?\u201d Eddie probed.</p><p>\u201cAlthough we cannot see it, I believe our lives hold more gifts than we expect.\u201d She replied. Something about her answer seemed coded, and wrong. Eddie nodded and scribbled notes in his notepad, and when he looked up, he looked the doctor in the eye. The sea blue he saw churned questionably, but he could tell she was trying to calm them. Everything about her seemed kind and caring, but Eddie knew better. Her records were astounding and almost too perfect. When there was perfection, there were secrets. </p><p><i>\u201cDo not trust her.\u201d</i></p><p>*~*~*</p><p>\u201cEddie! You\u2019re back!\u201d Peter chirped as he looked up from his homework. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I expected.\u201d Eddie replied as he passed the table Peter sat at. \u201cHave you seen Stark anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s in his workshop.\u201d </p><p>And with that, Eddie quietly fast-walked to the cluttered workshop.

One of the cameraman\u2019s gaze fell on Eddie, and they did a double take.</p><p>\u201cDamn Eddie, we barely recognized you.\u201d the cameramen commented as Eddie walked to them. </p><p>\u201cThe boss said to dress up, so I did.\u201d Eddie replied as he shoved his hands in the topcoat pockets.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you look like you just walked out of a suit magazine.\u201d </p><p>Eddie rolled his eyes and glanced to the front desk.</p><p>\u201cCome on; I\u2019ve been told Wendell doesn\u2019t like tardiness.\u201d</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>\u201cMr. Brock, how lovely to meet you.\u201d a soft voice welcomed as Eddie stepped into the pale office. Sitting at the glass desk was a middle aged women with fair skin and piercing, ocean blue eyes. Her dark brown hair was pulled back in a tight bun and clear glasses frames sat at the bridge of her nose. </p><p>\u201cLikewise, Dr. Wendell.\u201d Eddie politely replied as he walked over to the desk. \u201cWould you like to head over to the conference room? Everything has been set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>As Eddie walked beside the tall doctor, he noticed her flats clicked like tall heels and echoed throughout the hallway. Although she seemed kind-hearted and caring, Eddie\u2019s guard was up. Drake tried to have the same facade, but he had his faults with it. Once they made it to the conference room, the two cameramen inside the room began to mess with the camera. The conference room had been emptied on one half of the room and only a small glass table and two chairs opposite from one another sat in the middle. Before the doctor continued on her path to one of the chairs, Eddie walked past her and pulled out the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, Mr. Brock.\u201d Dr. Wendell thanked as she sat down and adjusted her spotless, white lab coat. \u201c I have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect you to be the chivalrous type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found that it comes with age.\u201d Eddie replied, trying to be more formal than what he was used to. Once the cameras were ready and the welcoming,idle conversation had subsided, Eddie pulled out his small notepad along with a pen that was heavier than his usual gel pen. As he pulled it out of his pocket, he realize his pen had been replaced with a fancier pen that had black and gold designs on it. A small, yellow sticky note was attached to it and read: <i>\u201cYou are <b>not</b> using a cheap old pen for this. Just give it back once your done. - TS.\u201d </i></p><p>Eddie smirked and put the sticky note back in his pocket and twisted the pen open.</p><p>\u201cSo, Dr. Wendell, how have you been since the incident involving Carlton Drake?\u201d Eddie questioned as he flipped open his notepad. </p><p>\u201cThe company has been alright, but I, personally, have been upset at him.\u201d the doctor began. \u201cI cannot believe I worked with such a horrid man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you and Drake work on?\u201d </p><p>The doctor\u2019s eyes glaze drifted to the side as she sighed. </p><p>\u201cOne of our main projects was a STEM cell research experiment, but he stopped working with me once he found a cure for cancer. I wanted to continue finding cures for other diseases, but he had other plans in mind.\u201d She explained as she pushed her glasses up. </p><p>Eddie glanced down at his list of notes and quietly calculated which one would be best to ask next. Although he had done numerous interviews and meetings with well known people, this one gave him the most nerves. He knew if he messed this meeting up, he couldn\u2019t come back from it. Finding and investigating his own stories in California was a walk in the park compared to now. With this investigation, he had to plan out everything to make sure if something failed, he already had a plan B. </p><p>\u201cDid you or Drake ever become competitive with each other? I know both of you had butted heads with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Mr. Stark is a smart man, there was no way he could compete with our work.\u201d Dr. Wendell half-scoffed; her voice almost cold. \u201cDrake and I did have a falling out, but our only competition was to find cures for illnesses.\u201d</p><p>She fiddled with one of the opaque, white buttons on her lab coat.</p><p>\u201cI understand you are trying to get answers for his actions, but I\u2019m having trouble understanding why I would be a person of interest.\u201d she added. </p><p>\u201cYou are one of the closest people he worked with. Everyone is dying to get their hands on his research with the samples he brought from space.\u201d Eddie replied, choosing his response carefully. Her dark brown eyebrows furrowed as fought a glare.</p><p>\u201cI would never agree to work with those <i>things</i>.\u201d She spat, and Eddie felt the symbiote stirr angrily in his chest, but they stayed quiet. \u201cI may have been a friend to Mr. Drake, but he is a monster for killing people and using them as test subjects for a selfish cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you believe he should have done with his resources?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life has been dedicated to finding the best way to heal people. Mr. Drake had all the resources to continue our research in defeating diseases that have wiped out thousands, but he chose to move his research to space. Same goes for Mr. Stark. He could have helped with developing better prosthetics; Instead, he developed weapons and suits of armor.\u201d</p><p>The cold air Eddie felt when he had walked into the building seemed colder now. </p><p><i>\u201cEddie.\u201d</i> Venom whispered. Eddie was about to scold the symbiote mentally, but he halted. They knew not to talk during meetings and interviews, so it had to be important. <i>\u201cSomething\u2019s not right. We do not trust her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>But she cares about people\u2019s lives and advancing medicine.</i> Eddie countered internally.</p><p><i>\u201cDidn\u2019t Drake say the same thing?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMr. Drake seemed to have forgotten how special human lives are and how they can advance research.\u201d Dr. Wendell continued with a sigh, as if to cool off her building anger. \u201cHe may have cured cancer, but he won\u2019t find cures to other deadly diseases floating around in space. I\u2019m sure the answers are all here on earth.\u201d</p><p>Although the doctor\u2019s answer seemed sincere and kind, something about it sat wrong in Eddie. She was hinting something, but she wasn\u2019t going to state it; especially not in front of cameras.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you say that?\u201d Eddie probed.</p><p>\u201cAlthough we cannot see it, I believe our lives hold more gifts than we expect.\u201d She replied. Something about her answer seemed coded, and wrong. Eddie nodded and scribbled notes in his notepad, and when he looked up, he looked the doctor in the eye. The sea blue he saw churned questionably, but he could tell she was trying to calm them. Everything about her seemed kind and caring, but Eddie knew better. Her records were astounding and almost too perfect. When there was perfection, there were secrets. </p><p><i>\u201cDo not trust her.\u201d</i></p><p>*~*~*</p><p>\u201cEddie! You\u2019re back!\u201d Peter chirped as he looked up from his homework. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I expected.\u201d Eddie replied as he passed the table Peter sat at. \u201cHave you seen Stark anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s in his workshop.\u201d </p><p>And with that, Eddie quietly fast-walked to the cluttered workshop. As he walked in, he noticed Tony looking through several projected blue screens. They all displayed articles about people going missing within the past week, and their link.</p><p>\u201cStark.

Even though he wore the nice topcoat Tony had let him borrow, a chill crept up is spine. The building was similar to Carlton Drake&rsquo;s in terms of the amount of windows and glass designs, but it had a different air to it. Drake liked to show off what he had done, but it seemed like Dr. Wendell was more modest. The clean glass windows let the grey light spill in and illuminate the white and silver office furniture. Paperwork was neatly organized at every corner and magazines were stacked perfectly in the lounge area. It was slightly off putting to see everything so clean and organized. Even the light grey tile floor seemed to be spotless. As Eddie glanced around at the people working there, he scoffed at the fact that Tony was right. Everyone there was wearing business professional attire, and Eddie would have stuck out like a sore thumb if he had worn what he had originally planned to wear. </p><p>As Eddie approached the front desk, he noticed the two cameramen from his work were scanning the building for someone. One of the cameraman&rsquo;s gaze fell on Eddie, and they did a double take.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn Eddie, we barely recognized you.&rdquo; the cameramen commented as Eddie walked to them. </p><p>&ldquo;The boss said to dress up, so I did.&rdquo; Eddie replied as he shoved his hands in the topcoat pockets.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you look like you just walked out of a suit magazine.&rdquo; </p><p>Eddie rolled his eyes and glanced to the front desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on; I&rsquo;ve been told Wendell doesn&rsquo;t like tardiness.&rdquo;</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Brock, how lovely to meet you.&rdquo; a soft voice welcomed as Eddie stepped into the pale office. Sitting at the glass desk was a middle aged women with fair skin and piercing, ocean blue eyes. Her dark brown hair was pulled back in a tight bun and clear glasses frames sat at the bridge of her nose. </p><p>&ldquo;Likewise, Dr. Wendell.&rdquo; Eddie politely replied as he walked over to the desk. &ldquo;Would you like to head over to the conference room? Everything has been set up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lead the way.&rdquo;</p><p>As Eddie walked beside the tall doctor, he noticed her flats clicked like tall heels and echoed throughout the hallway. Although she seemed kind-hearted and caring, Eddie&rsquo;s guard was up. Drake tried to have the same facade, but he had his faults with it. Once they made it to the conference room, the two cameramen inside the room began to mess with the camera. The conference room had been emptied on one half of the room and only a small glass table and two chairs opposite from one another sat in the middle. Before the doctor continued on her path to one of the chairs, Eddie walked past her and pulled out the chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Why thank you, Mr. Brock.&rdquo; Dr. Wendell thanked as she sat down and adjusted her spotless, white lab coat. &ldquo; I have to admit, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be the chivalrous type.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found that it comes with age.&rdquo; Eddie replied, trying to be more formal than what he was used to. Once the cameras were ready and the welcoming,idle conversation had subsided, Eddie pulled out his small notepad along with a pen that was heavier than his usual gel pen. As he pulled it out of his pocket, he realize his pen had been replaced with a fancier pen that had black and gold designs on it. A small, yellow sticky note was attached to it and read: <i>&ldquo;You are <b>not</b> using a cheap old pen for this. Just give it back once your done. - TS.&rdquo; </i></p><p>Eddie smirked and put the sticky note back in his pocket and twisted the pen open.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Dr. Wendell, how have you been since the incident involving Carlton Drake?&rdquo; Eddie questioned as he flipped open his notepad. </p><p>&ldquo;The company has been alright, but I, personally, have been upset at him.&rdquo; the doctor began. &ldquo;I cannot believe I worked with such a horrid man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you and Drake work on?&rdquo; </p><p>The doctor&rsquo;s eyes glaze drifted to the side as she sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;One of our main projects was a STEM cell research experiment, but he stopped working with me once he found a cure for cancer. I wanted to continue finding cures for other diseases, but he had other plans in mind.&rdquo; She explained as she pushed her glasses up. </p><p>Eddie glanced down at his list of notes and quietly calculated which one would be best to ask next. Although he had done numerous interviews and meetings with well known people, this one gave him the most nerves. He knew if he messed this meeting up, he couldn&rsquo;t come back from it. Finding and investigating his own stories in California was a walk in the park compared to now. With this investigation, he had to plan out everything to make sure if something failed, he already had a plan B. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you or Drake ever become competitive with each other? I know both of you had butted heads with Tony Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;While Mr. Stark is a smart man, there was no way he could compete with our work.&rdquo; Dr. Wendell half-scoffed; her voice almost cold. &ldquo;Drake and I did have a falling out, but our only competition was to find cures for illnesses.&rdquo;</p><p>She fiddled with one of the opaque, white buttons on her lab coat.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand you are trying to get answers for his actions, but I&rsquo;m having trouble understanding why I would be a person of interest.&rdquo; she added. </p><p>&ldquo;You are one of the closest people he worked with. Everyone is dying to get their hands on his research with the samples he brought from space.&rdquo; Eddie replied, choosing his response carefully. Her dark brown eyebrows furrowed as fought a glare.</p><p>&ldquo;I would never agree to work with those <i>things</i>.&rdquo; She spat, and Eddie felt the symbiote stirr angrily in his chest, but they stayed quiet. &ldquo;I may have been a friend to Mr. Drake, but he is a monster for killing people and using them as test subjects for a selfish cause.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you believe he should have done with his resources?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My life has been dedicated to finding the best way to heal people. Mr. Drake had all the resources to continue our research in defeating diseases that have wiped out thousands, but he chose to move his research to space. Same goes for Mr. Stark. He could have helped with developing better prosthetics; Instead, he developed weapons and suits of armor.&rdquo;</p><p>The cold air Eddie felt when he had walked into the building seemed colder now. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Eddie.&rdquo;</i> Venom whispered. Eddie was about to scold the symbiote mentally, but he halted. They knew not to talk during meetings and interviews, so it had to be important. <i>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s not right.
