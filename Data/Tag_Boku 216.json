(hero name)! over here!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201clook this way, (hero name)!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(hero name), do you have time for some questions?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 you plastered on a smile, forced and looking uncomfortable as you apologized and stuck as close to kirishima as you could without leading the reporters to believe something was going on between the two of you; that was the last thing you needed, some false rumor that you and red riot were an item.</p><p>\u00a0 security had seen the two of you approach, opening the doors for you and wishing you to have a good evening. you wished them the same before your eyes fell on the beautifully-decorated and overly-crowded ballroom.</p><p>\u00a0 there was an open bar in the middle of the room, a dance floor located in the far left corner, tables placed throughout while groups of heroes and sidekicks talked animatedly among each other. everyone was dressed to impress with at least one piece of their costume to complete their outfit, most wearing their masks like you had done. there were a few faces you remembered seeing from various battles or on television, but you had no idea where you had wanted to go first.</p><p>\u00a0 kirishima, always one step ahead of you, placed his hand on your back again,\u00a0\u201ccome on, i see some friends i want to introduce you to!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 you nodded,\u00a0\u201cokay!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 he led you down the stairs and towards one of the tables located near the bar. you were stopped a few times by people saying hello to either of you two before kirishima\u2019s hand left your back and he walked ahead of you to the table.</p><p>\u00a0 \u201ceiji-kun!\u201d a girl with pink hair and pink skin called out excitedly.</p><p>\u00a0 the rest of the group turned to see the redhead with wide smiles, welcoming him with a hug and multiple questions of \u201c<i>how are you? how have you been?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 </i>you stood awkwardly to the side until the pink-haired girl noticed you with wide, black and gold eyes.\u00a0\u201ceiji-kun, is this your girlfriend?!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 your eyes widened,\u00a0\u201chuh?! n-no! we\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201csorry, guys, i\u2019m still single as ever! this is my partner at the agency i was transferred to, (name), also known as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(<i>hero name</i>),\u201d the black-haired boy muttered in awe.\u00a0\u201ci\u2019ve seen your work! it\u2019s so nice to meet you! this is like, a dream come true!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 a blush blossomed across your cheeks,\u00a0\u201co-oh, thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201ci\u2019m ashido!\u201d the pink-haired girl grinned,\u00a0\u201cthis is sero,\u201d she motioned to the black-haired one,\u00a0\u201cand kaminari!\u201d the boy with the lightning bolt stripe in his bangs smirked.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201chave you seen bakugou yet? i want to introduce him to (name),\u201d kirishima asked.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cbakugou\u2019s coming?!\u201d kaminari asked incredulously.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s what he told me,\u201d the redhead replied with a shrug.\u00a0\u201cthough, he probably found a way to get out of it.\u201d his lips pulled into a frown,\u00a0\u201cdamn, i was really looking forward to seeing him again.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 ashido gave kirishima a small smile,\u00a0\u201che might turn up sooner or later! but, now that you\u2019re here, we should all go dancing!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 kaminari\u2019s eyes lit up,\u00a0\u201cthat sounds like a great idea, you coming, (hero name)?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cme? oh, uh, i don\u2019t know\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201ccome on, it\u2019ll be fun, i promise!\u201d kirishima pulled you with him to the dance floor, the rest of the bakusquad following suit. there was some shitty, bass-heavy club music booming from the speakers, and you could barely hear yourself think as kirishima took your hands and started to dance with you.</p><p>\u00a0 your cheeks blossomed with a bright red, and you hesitantly started to dance with him, trying to find an equal rhythm with your partner.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 it wasn\u2019t long until you found a groove, and you started swinging your hips to the beat, the dress allowing for a little more movement than you would have expected from the tightly-fitting attire. ashido started to grind on you, and you gasped, not expecting that from the practical-stranger who you\u2019d met not even five minutes ago, but you went along with it.</p><p>\u00a0 you let your eyes wander off the dance floor as you looked around, and you notice a pair of crimson eyes trained on you from the upstairs balcony of tables, his arms resting on the rail as he was slouched over the edge. you quickly looked away, refusing to believe that the blond had been staring at you.</p><p>\u00a0 a few songs later, you lot had decided to walk back to the table, sweaty and slightly out of breath.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cso, kirishima, what\u2019s (name) like? big change from bakugou?\u201d sero asked, taking a swig of whiskey from his glass. you were off getting a round of waters for the table at the bar, not a big fan of drinking yourself.</p><p>\u00a0 the redhead shrugged,\u00a0\u201csomewhat. they\u2019re both pretty wild on the battlefield, but she\u2019s definitely nicer and a lot more levelheaded. just as observant, too, nothing gets passed her. though, she doesn\u2019t call me <i>shitty hair</i>\u00a0all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cand here i thought you liked the nickname,\u201d a voice grumbled from behind him.</p><p>\u00a0 the group whipped their heads around to see bakugou dressed in a nice suit with his hero mask, mouths gaping in surprise with their eyes wide.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cbakugou!\u201d ashido exclaimed, giving the irritated blond a hug.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cyou actually came!\u201d kirishima was more excited than a puppy going for a walk, wide grin plastered across his face.<br/></p><p>\u00a0 <i>tch</i>.\u00a0\u201ci\u2019ve been here for a while, saw you guys looking like idiots out there,\u201d he replied.\u00a0\u201c<i>oi</i>, pinky, let go of me already.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 ashido let go of him with a sheepish blush,\u00a0\u201csorry, it\u2019s been so long, baku-kun! we all missed you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cyeah, yeah,\u201d he grumbled.\u00a0\u201cso, where\u2019s that girl you were dancing with? she my replacement?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 speak of the devil; you waltzed over to the table with cups stacked on top of each other in one hand, a pitcher of ice cold water in the other.\u00a0\u201chey!

(hero name)! over here!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;look this way, (hero name)!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(hero name), do you have time for some questions?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; you plastered on a smile, forced and looking uncomfortable as you apologized and stuck as close to kirishima as you could without leading the reporters to believe something was going on between the two of you; that was the last thing you needed, some false rumor that you and red riot were an item.</p><p>&nbsp; security had seen the two of you approach, opening the doors for you and wishing you to have a good evening. you wished them the same before your eyes fell on the beautifully-decorated and overly-crowded ballroom.</p><p>&nbsp; there was an open bar in the middle of the room, a dance floor located in the far left corner, tables placed throughout while groups of heroes and sidekicks talked animatedly among each other. everyone was dressed to impress with at least one piece of their costume to complete their outfit, most wearing their masks like you had done. there were a few faces you remembered seeing from various battles or on television, but you had no idea where you had wanted to go first.</p><p>&nbsp; kirishima, always one step ahead of you, placed his hand on your back again,&nbsp;&ldquo;come on, i see some friends i want to introduce you to!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; you nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;okay!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he led you down the stairs and towards one of the tables located near the bar. you were stopped a few times by people saying hello to either of you two before kirishima&rsquo;s hand left your back and he walked ahead of you to the table.</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;eiji-kun!&rdquo; a girl with pink hair and pink skin called out excitedly.</p><p>&nbsp; the rest of the group turned to see the redhead with wide smiles, welcoming him with a hug and multiple questions of &ldquo;<i>how are you? how have you been?!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp; </i>you stood awkwardly to the side until the pink-haired girl noticed you with wide, black and gold eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;eiji-kun, is this your girlfriend?!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; your eyes widened,&nbsp;&ldquo;huh?! n-no! we&rsquo;re not&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;sorry, guys, i&rsquo;m still single as ever! this is my partner at the agency i was transferred to, (name), also known as&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(<i>hero name</i>),&rdquo; the black-haired boy muttered in awe.&nbsp;&ldquo;i&rsquo;ve seen your work! it&rsquo;s so nice to meet you! this is like, a dream come true!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; a blush blossomed across your cheeks,&nbsp;&ldquo;o-oh, thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;i&rsquo;m ashido!&rdquo; the pink-haired girl grinned,&nbsp;&ldquo;this is sero,&rdquo; she motioned to the black-haired one,&nbsp;&ldquo;and kaminari!&rdquo; the boy with the lightning bolt stripe in his bangs smirked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;have you seen bakugou yet? i want to introduce him to (name),&rdquo; kirishima asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;bakugou&rsquo;s coming?!&rdquo; kaminari asked incredulously.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what he told me,&rdquo; the redhead replied with a shrug.&nbsp;&ldquo;though, he probably found a way to get out of it.&rdquo; his lips pulled into a frown,&nbsp;&ldquo;damn, i was really looking forward to seeing him again.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; ashido gave kirishima a small smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;he might turn up sooner or later! but, now that you&rsquo;re here, we should all go dancing!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; kaminari&rsquo;s eyes lit up,&nbsp;&ldquo;that sounds like a great idea, you coming, (hero name)?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;me? oh, uh, i don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;come on, it&rsquo;ll be fun, i promise!&rdquo; kirishima pulled you with him to the dance floor, the rest of the bakusquad following suit. there was some shitty, bass-heavy club music booming from the speakers, and you could barely hear yourself think as kirishima took your hands and started to dance with you.</p><p>&nbsp; your cheeks blossomed with a bright red, and you hesitantly started to dance with him, trying to find an equal rhythm with your partner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; it wasn&rsquo;t long until you found a groove, and you started swinging your hips to the beat, the dress allowing for a little more movement than you would have expected from the tightly-fitting attire. ashido started to grind on you, and you gasped, not expecting that from the practical-stranger who you&rsquo;d met not even five minutes ago, but you went along with it.</p><p>&nbsp; you let your eyes wander off the dance floor as you looked around, and you notice a pair of crimson eyes trained on you from the upstairs balcony of tables, his arms resting on the rail as he was slouched over the edge. you quickly looked away, refusing to believe that the blond had been staring at you.</p><p>&nbsp; a few songs later, you lot had decided to walk back to the table, sweaty and slightly out of breath.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;so, kirishima, what&rsquo;s (name) like? big change from bakugou?&rdquo; sero asked, taking a swig of whiskey from his glass. you were off getting a round of waters for the table at the bar, not a big fan of drinking yourself.</p><p>&nbsp; the redhead shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;somewhat. they&rsquo;re both pretty wild on the battlefield, but she&rsquo;s definitely nicer and a lot more levelheaded. just as observant, too, nothing gets passed her. though, she doesn&rsquo;t call me <i>shitty hair</i>&nbsp;all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;and here i thought you liked the nickname,&rdquo; a voice grumbled from behind him.</p><p>&nbsp; the group whipped their heads around to see bakugou dressed in a nice suit with his hero mask, mouths gaping in surprise with their eyes wide.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;bakugou!&rdquo; ashido exclaimed, giving the irritated blond a hug.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;you actually came!&rdquo; kirishima was more excited than a puppy going for a walk, wide grin plastered across his face.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; <i>tch</i>.&nbsp;&ldquo;i&rsquo;ve been here for a while, saw you guys looking like idiots out there,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>oi</i>, pinky, let go of me already.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; ashido let go of him with a sheepish blush,&nbsp;&ldquo;sorry, it&rsquo;s been so long, baku-kun! we all missed you so much!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;yeah, yeah,&rdquo; he grumbled.&nbsp;&ldquo;so, where&rsquo;s that girl you were dancing with? she my replacement?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; speak of the devil; you waltzed over to the table with cups stacked on top of each other in one hand, a pitcher of ice cold water in the other.&nbsp;&ldquo;hey! sorry it took so long, this one guy would <i>not</i>&nbsp;stop talking to me,&rdquo; you complained as you set the stuff down on the table, failing to notice the blond gaping at you.</p><p>&nbsp; kirishima dismissed the apology with a wave of his hand,&nbsp;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;yeah, you did look pretty hot out there!&rdquo; kaminari wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>&nbsp; you blushed,&nbsp;&ldquo;k-kaminari&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;where the fuck are your manners, pikachu?&rdquo; bakugou glared.</p><p>&nbsp; you jumped, finally noticing the blond who was staring at you earlier,&nbsp;&ldquo;o-oh! you scared me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he clicked his tongue, not responding to you. however, his eyes still lingered for a moment before he turned back to kirishima.&nbsp;&ldquo;you gonna stand there, or you gonna introduce us, shitty hair?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; the redhead blushed,&nbsp;&ldquo;oh, bakugou, this is (name), aka (hero name), (name), this is bakugou.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; your eyes widened,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>this</i>&nbsp;is bakugou?!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; the blond glared,&nbsp;&ldquo;what?! somethin&rsquo; wrong with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;n-no!&rdquo; you stammered, holding your hands up in surrender.&nbsp;&ldquo;i-i&rsquo;ve just heard so much about you! it&rsquo;s nice to finally meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he rolled his eyes, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>&nbsp; you huffed at his behavior and turned to kirishima and his conversation with kaminari, sero, and ashido, pitching in here and there.</p><p>&nbsp; when you all had quenched your thirst and sero and ashido finally reached their desired level of drunken-ness, kirishima had suggested you all head back to the dance floor, bakugou immediately declining. the other four had accepted his answer, but you hung back, not used to bakugou and knowing to leave his first answer as his final answer.</p><p>&nbsp; you looked over at him,&nbsp;&ldquo;can&rsquo;t dance?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he scowled,&nbsp;&ldquo;i <i>can</i>&nbsp;dance, i just don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;oh, well, do you want company?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;just go with shitty hair, i&rsquo;ll be fine by myself,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;if i fucking dance with you guys, will you leave me alone?&rdquo; he snapped.</p><p>&nbsp; your eyes widened,&nbsp;&ldquo;i-i&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he grabbed your hand, the heat of his palm surprising you, and pulled you along through the throng of people. you two couldn&rsquo;t exactly get to where kirishima, kaminari, ashido, and sero were, so you stuck to some random place in the crowd.</p><p>&nbsp; you hesitated, not sure exactly what to do, but you gasped as he grabbed your arms to toss around his neck, and he slipped his hands around your waist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;this alright with you?&rdquo; he asked in your ear, you barely able to hear him over the loud music.</p><p>&nbsp; you nodded and slowly started to dance with the boy, still keeping a little bit of distance. after all, you two had just met.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;come on, i know you can dance better than that,&rdquo; he smirked.</p><p>&nbsp; a blush rose to your cheeks,&nbsp;&ldquo;i, uh&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; he pulled you tighter, your body flush against him as he started to move your bodies to the beat of the song, the smirk never leaving his cocky face.&nbsp;&ldquo;let me know if you get uncomfortable,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&nbsp; you nodded, and your body started to warm up to his, hips moving a bit more freely as you started to feel more secure with your movements, getting back into the groove you had earlier. you were completely enveloped in his scent, smelling of burnt sugar with a slight hint of campfire smoke. to others, it may have smelled strange, but it smelled heavenly to you.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;so,&rdquo; you started, gaining a bit of confidence with the hotheaded stranger,&nbsp;&ldquo;were my eyes playing tricks, or were you staring at me earlier?&rdquo; a blush still played on your cheeks as you asked him, but you daringly looked the blond in the eyes, crimson and (eye color) meeting. you looked down from his intense stare, a bit embarrassed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;caught that, huh?&rdquo; he flashed his pearly whites.&nbsp;&ldquo;shitty hair was right, nothing gets passed you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; your brows furrowed in confusion,&nbsp;&ldquo;huh?&rdquo; you looked up, realizing how close the two of you really were when your noses bumped together.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;so, tell me, if you&rsquo;re as observant as shitty hair says you are, can you tell what i want to do right now?&rdquo; he whispered into your ear, lips pulled upward in a cocky grin. he pulled back to see your flustered face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;i, uh, i&rsquo;m not sure&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;then stop me if it gets too far.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; without another word, his lips met yours, crashing hard with lust and his hands gripped tightly into your waist. you let out a slight moan at the contact, fingers reaching up and pulling at his hair.</p><p>&nbsp; however, just before the kiss became too heated, you heard a couple of wolfwhistles. you pulled away from bakugou quickly, cheeks a bright red as you noticed kirishima, kaminari, ashido, and sero cheering the two of you on.</p><p>&nbsp; bakugou scowled at them, separating from you. he looked back to you.&nbsp;&ldquo;to be continued, perhaps? friday night at seven?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; your eyes widened,&nbsp;&ldquo;y-yeah, sounds good.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><i>it&rsquo;s a bit lengthy, but first ever imagine!
