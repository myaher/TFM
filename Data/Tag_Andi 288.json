Cyrus\u2019 park day with TJ had boosted the younger boys confidence immensely and he was tackling things with a relative amount of ease.\u00a0TJ works one morning and two afternoons a week but other than that TJ and Cyrus had been consistently spending their days together when their parents would allow.</p><p>In the past week Amber had stayed for dinner one night after her therapy session which was awkward to begin with - dining with the lady she has to open up to - but once she and Cyrus broke away to watch a movie together it was natural and full of easy laughs.\u00a0Cyrus thought it worked out perfectly that Amber\u2019s sessions were on a Tuesday evening because TJ was occupied at the gym.\u00a0</p><p>Today TJ and Cyrus head to the virtual reality arcade together for another task on the list. As per usual, the two end up messing around a lot and playfully get off task. Cyrus found the total emersion of the VR completely terrifying and TJ found<i> that </i>completely amusing but without being\u00a0facetious.\u00a0</p><p>After completing the task and a bit more mucking around, the two decide to take a break from the games. TJ makes his way to the restroom whilst Cyrus secures a table. Cyrus hadn\u2019t even been seated for a minute when a familiar face approaches him. </p><p>\u201cHey, Marty!\u201d Cyrus greets him warmly. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHey, Cyrus, are you here alone?\u201d Marty pricks up a brow and quickly lets his eyes scan the room. Cyrus suspected he was trying to work out if Buffy was present. </p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m here with TJ.\u201d Cyrus announces. </p><p>Marty scrunches his face in confusion, \u201cAs in Kippen? As if the guy that\u2019s a jerk to everyone, Buffy included?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTJ is just misunderstood.\u201d Cyrus frowns lightly, \u201cHe\u2019s different now to how he was..\u00a0You two would probably be really good friends if you gave him a chance.\u201d </p><p>Marty gives Cyrus an unconvinced look and then nods his head as if he were motioning towards something. Cyrus turns back and finds TJ approaching. </p><p>\u201cHey, Marty.\u201d TJ nods in the other boys direction as he sits at the table. </p><p>An awkward few seconds pass and Cyrus scrambles to quickly fill the silence. \u201cSo, Marty, are you here with anyone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah, my mom\u2019s across the road at the grocery store.

Cyrus&rsquo; park day with TJ had boosted the younger boys confidence immensely and he was tackling things with a relative amount of ease.&nbsp;TJ works one morning and two afternoons a week but other than that TJ and Cyrus had been consistently spending their days together when their parents would allow.</p><p>In the past week Amber had stayed for dinner one night after her therapy session which was awkward to begin with - dining with the lady she has to open up to - but once she and Cyrus broke away to watch a movie together it was natural and full of easy laughs.&nbsp;Cyrus thought it worked out perfectly that Amber&rsquo;s sessions were on a Tuesday evening because TJ was occupied at the gym.&nbsp;</p><p>Today TJ and Cyrus head to the virtual reality arcade together for another task on the list. As per usual, the two end up messing around a lot and playfully get off task. Cyrus found the total emersion of the VR completely terrifying and TJ found<i> that </i>completely amusing but without being&nbsp;facetious.&nbsp;</p><p>After completing the task and a bit more mucking around, the two decide to take a break from the games. TJ makes his way to the restroom whilst Cyrus secures a table. Cyrus hadn&rsquo;t even been seated for a minute when a familiar face approaches him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Marty!&rdquo; Cyrus greets him warmly. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Cyrus, are you here alone?&rdquo; Marty pricks up a brow and quickly lets his eyes scan the room. Cyrus suspected he was trying to work out if Buffy was present. </p><p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m here with TJ.&rdquo; Cyrus announces. </p><p>Marty scrunches his face in confusion, &ldquo;As in Kippen? As if the guy that&rsquo;s a jerk to everyone, Buffy included?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;TJ is just misunderstood.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns lightly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s different now to how he was..&nbsp;You two would probably be really good friends if you gave him a chance.&rdquo; </p><p>Marty gives Cyrus an unconvinced look and then nods his head as if he were motioning towards something. Cyrus turns back and finds TJ approaching. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Marty.&rdquo; TJ nods in the other boys direction as he sits at the table. </p><p>An awkward few seconds pass and Cyrus scrambles to quickly fill the silence. &ldquo;So, Marty, are you here with anyone?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nah, my mom&rsquo;s across the road at the grocery store. I thought I&rsquo;d kill time in here.&rdquo; Marty answers.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you come here much?&rdquo; TJ tries to contribute but Cyrus could tell his friend felt uneasy.</p><p>&ldquo;Only once before.&rdquo; Marty laughs awkwardly and Cyrus grimaces. </p><p>&ldquo;Am I missing something?&rdquo; TJ doesn&rsquo;t understand the look they exchanged. </p><p>&ldquo;He came here on a fake date with Buffy.&rdquo; Cyrus explains. </p><p>&ldquo;Jonah and Andi were there too.&rdquo; Marty adds. &ldquo;They were on a real date.. I think.. &nbsp;Actually I have no idea.&rdquo; </p><p>Cyrus laughs because he was all too familiar with the awkward beginnings of Andi and Jonah.&nbsp;&ldquo;Those were dark and confusing times, I&rsquo;m not sure either of them knew what was going on.&rdquo; Cyrus jokes and Marty chuckles lightly.</p><p>TJ folds his arms and coaxes his head as he looks across at Marty, &ldquo;So are you still obsessed with Buffy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not obsessed with Buffy!&rdquo; Marty says defensively. </p><p>Cyrus turns to TJ with a disapproving look. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; TJ shrugs his shoulders at Cyrus, &ldquo;Everybody knows he had a huge crush on her, it was<i> very </i>obvious.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t mean we need to address it at the table.&rdquo; Cyrus says in a hushed tone as if Marty couldn&rsquo;t hear their conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>had</i> a crush on Buffy, past tense and I was not<i> obsessed.</i>&rdquo; Marty folds his arms like a huffy child and TJ wears and amused smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;You have a girlfriend now, right?&rdquo; Cyrus tries to steer the conversation somewhere new. </p><p>&ldquo;Had, past tense.&rdquo; Marty repeats with an exhale.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you break up because you&rsquo;re still obsessed with Buffy?&rdquo; TJ bites down on his smile as he anticipates Cyrus&rsquo; disapproving stare.

Why had it never occurred to him that her unknown crush could be on Marty?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Earth to underdog?&rdquo; TJ grabs Cyrus&rsquo; attention as he had zoned out thinking about Buffy.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Cyrus is confused for a moment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Marty, Buffy?&rdquo; TJ summarises.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about that with you.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns.&nbsp;&ldquo;Buffy wouldn&rsquo;t like me discussing her with you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re all friends now.&rdquo; TJ states.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Still.&rdquo; Cyrus shakes his head, the last thing he wanted was to get into trouble with Buffy again over something he&rsquo;s shared about her with TJ.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you and Buffy have never talked about me before?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why would we?&rdquo; Cyrus laughs nervously and he regretted his jittery reply although TJ didn&rsquo;t seem to register it as odd, his joking demeanour remains.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m the coolest guy you know.&rdquo; TJ smirks and it was obvious he was playing around.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jonah is the coolest guy I know.&rdquo; Cyrus holds back a laugh.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ cups a hand to his chest like Cyrus had just wounded him with his words.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have a reputation to uphold and you&rsquo;re saying I&rsquo;m second best to ultimate frisbee boy?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus sends a scold sidewards at him for the little jab at Jonah&rsquo;s sporting preference but he still decides to play along and take TJ down a peg or two in the process.&nbsp;&ldquo;Who said anything about you being <i>second</i> best?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How low on the list am I?\"&nbsp;TJ fakes a gasp and exaggerates an upset expression,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being very mean to me this afternoon.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus worries TJ was serious and properly apologises and TJ laughs quietly at the neurotic and sincere reaction. With a smile he says,&nbsp;&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t be mean if you tried, underdog.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>[<a href=\"http://seriestrash.tumblr.com/post/178180102075/the-list-chapter-four\">Next Chapter</a>]<br /></p><hr /><p><b>End Notes: </b><i>Chapter Three!! </i>I Hope you&rsquo;re enjoying the story so far.

Cyrus&rsquo; park day with TJ had boosted the younger boys confidence immensely and he was tackling things with a relative amount of ease.&nbsp;TJ works one morning and two afternoons a week but other than that TJ and Cyrus had been consistently spending their days together when their parents would allow.</p>\n<p>In the past week Amber had stayed for dinner one night after her therapy session which was awkward to begin with - dining with the lady she has to open up to - but once she and Cyrus broke away to watch a movie together it was natural and full of easy laughs.&nbsp;Cyrus thought it worked out perfectly that Amber&rsquo;s sessions were on a Tuesday evening because TJ was occupied at the gym.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today TJ and Cyrus head to the virtual reality arcade together for another task on the list. As per usual, the two end up messing around a lot and playfully get off task. Cyrus found the total emersion of the VR completely terrifying and TJ found<i> that </i>completely amusing but without being&nbsp;facetious.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After completing the task and a bit more mucking around, the two decide to take a break from the games. TJ makes his way to the restroom whilst Cyrus secures a table. Cyrus hadn&rsquo;t even been seated for a minute when a familiar face approaches him. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, Marty!&rdquo; Cyrus greets him warmly. </p>\n</p>",

        "body": "<p>So I\u2019m really not a huge part of the Andi Mack fandom, I have just finished watching it during it\u2019s hiatus and then because I picked up on Tyrus I wanted to see what other people have said about their scenes and I noticed some stuff and I wanted to share it because I\u2019m really bad about containing myself with this sort of stuff and I haven\u2019t seen this exact stuff being said \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05</p><p>Okay so we all know that there are limited scenes with Tyrus as a whole, but the ones we do see I find are always meaningful and hint to their endgame/relationship. I\u2019ve seen posts that comment on how they are there for each other, how they build each other up etc. I\u2019m kind of going to add to that in a way.</p><p>Anyway, so I noticed how TJ shoves Cyrus (not in a bad way); in a metaphorical and physical way. Cyrus also does it, but in a different way, but I\u2019ll talk about that last.</p><p>So first let\u2019s go to the Muffin scene.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s their first interaction and TJ immediately decides to teach Cyrus. Already that\u2019s giving him more of an attachment to him, rather than keeping his distance and just getting what he wants; Buffy\u2019s tuition. That would have meant him just getting the muffin and be done with it..\u00a0</p><p>This already sets up TJ to be a nicer person than what he comes across as.

I would like to say that this is <i>after </i>Cyrus is already moving, meaning it\u2019s not that harsh, though it could easily come across as impatience on TJ\u2019s behalf. I think this is because TJ is just broody in this situation. This is the start of his redemption. But I think at the end of the day, it can be encouraging, it can also be metaphorical because he is putting Cyrus out of his comfort zone, but Cyrus wanted that in the first place.\u00a0</p><p>I think this scene is made better by the fact that TJ actually looks to Buffy briefly when Cyrus disturbs the crowd like\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to help him?\u201d\u00a0 or it\u2019s just to the crowd in general.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd86ca87062213ec27f75dbda35b37c7/tumblr_inline_pf0hj75UxG1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>He jumps in himself, getting Cyrus his muffin. He still lets Cyrus be the one to take it, he wasn\u2019t that impatient to the extent that he could have just picked it up and shoved it into Cyrus\u2019 hands.

It was just Cyrus in general as well.</p><p>Anyway, so moving on I guess.</p><p>We then also have the Swing scene (\u2764\u2764)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/117b95972d2f5e1719687a402cd093ae/tumblr_inline_pf06woJxzW1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d31cb09093506258fb2f2957a5dd98be/tumblr_inline_pf06wq8r7n1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fd0455503a3acf44debbc47044cdc4c/tumblr_inline_pf06zj6Qhu1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>(sorry for poor quality, but you get the idea)</p><p>I mean, TJ is literally pushing Cyrus&hellip; on a swing.</p><p>Again, TJ\u2019s facade falters here as well, when Cyrus calls him\u00a0\u201cscary basketball guy\u201d TJ introduces himself and it was like he was uncomfortable; he doesn\u2019t like that title. Honestly, he\u2019s just so soft in this scene. <i>He even giggles!\u00a0</i></p><p>The whole\u00a0\u201cSwing\u201d is a metaphor anyway. Cyrus goes there because it makes him feel better about himself, he reassures himself and that\u2019s what it stands for, self-love I guess, it\u2019s also just a break from anxiety. So the fact that TJ says about Cyrus reminding him to swing again means that he has gained some happiness again. It also fits in with the theme of not letting people get to them (I will reference this again later).\u00a0</p><p>But also my first thought when I watched this scene was I thought the swing was a reference to childhood; also how TJ was speaking and Cyrus\u2019 little songs made things seem childish. So maybe it was a reference to nostalgia (like most symbolism&rsquo;s of swings), goes into a theory I have about TJ anyway as well.\u00a0</p><p>The thing with swings is that they come back. That\u2019s another thing. One of them (TJ) pushes, but the other (Cyrus is always there). The muffin scene, TJ pushes him forward, TJ ends up having to put himself next to Cyrus as well to really help. Then with the swings TJ is pushing Cyrus, but Cyrus is coming back to him. There is something about TJ also doing the underdog thing as well, he starts off behind Cyrus (having his back), then the underdog thing, he is then facing Cyrus, still pushing him, encouraging him. Honestly it\u2019s so sweet\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was exhilarating!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWant another one?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo thank you\u201d<br/></p><p>*pouts*\u00a0\u201cToo bad\u201d *does it again with a cute side giggle*</p><p>The fact that TJ calls Cyrus underdog is so freaking sweet as well because it combines the swing scene and also the muffin scene (in my opinion), because in the muffin scene he stood up and kind of routed for Cyrus (\u201drouting for the underdog\u201d) and then it\u2019s just a reference to the swings where TJ performs an\u00a0\u201cunderdog\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The way the swing scene ends with Cyrus leaving is really nice too. To be honest, those two interactions with Cyrus and TJ so far are with Cyrus making his own decisions. He wanted that muffin and was okay with him doing it himself, then here Cyrus was offering TJ someone to talk to, to confide in without prompt, he had already made the decision to befriend TJ. The swing scene is where Cyrus sees right through TJ because he recognises that he also needs some uplifting.That\u2019s another thing with them both, they aren\u2019t so different, and that fact is what gets TJ to confide in Cyrus every time. Cyrus is a little more free in the respect that he makes it clear when he\u2019s nervous/anxious.\u00a0</p><p>He owns it and that\u2019s part in parcel to what Cyrus\u2019 arc is about; owning himself, which just so happens to be what TJ helps with on first interaction&hellip;</p><p>Then the final\u00a0\u201cshoving\u201d scene.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e12ac580a50be72ef6724e539778ee42/tumblr_inline_pf07qwBrxs1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>This is wwaaaaayyyyyy more friendly, playful and encouraging compared to the one in the muffin scene. I honestly think it was meant to parallel it. Cyrus wasn\u2019t walking in, but TJ\u2019s expression and the situation is just way to light to not be friendly and encouraging. It is just a direct parallel situation anyway with TJ helping Cyrus how to somersault is the exact same as TJ helping Cyrus to get the muffin. The context is different now; they know each other, they\u2019re friends and they are getting closer.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah.\u00a0</p><p>So what about Cyrus? This next situation is where both of them metaphorically push.</p><p>It\u2019s when TJ tells Cyrus about his Dyscalculia.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29e6691871dacb842b1fc77cfe82f863/tumblr_inline_pf0809VBCt1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33ead95dfb2180d3368ed7a23e61c409/tumblr_inline_pf0807WzRm1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>TJ is being broody, to Cyrus of all people, and the amazing thing is that Cyrus already knows TJ well enough to know that he doesn\u2019t mean it. When I first saw Cyrus put his hand on the rail, I thought it was TJ\u2019s arm (a girl can dream, I\u2019m sorry) but yeah, Cryus was reaching out because he knew TJ wasn\u2019t okay, but because TJ hates the idea of having dyscalculia, feeling like he\u2019s dumb and thinks he is looked down upon, he takes it out on people; pushing them away. We see this as TJ walks away from Cyrus. He was the same with Buffy, and Buffy pushed too, but there is something more against why he was the way he was with Buffy, and also Buffy\u2019s response as well could\u2019ve been better. Plus Buffy here in this scene was rubbing it in TJ\u2019s face. <i>Not good.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76477211cb60970334b157f960d5bfbb/tumblr_inline_pf085kXULA1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>Cyrus is practically un-phased, maybe a little disheartened, but he stays where he is; by the rails almost to let TJ know that he is still there.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d69544d4083ac1d2ce7734ed1218e67/tumblr_inline_pf0880VbU21tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t give up though, he goes after TJ, he pushes himself in as TJ pushes him away.

If there is anything that confirms Tyrus (other than the cast saying that TJ looking back was deffo to Cyrus) I would argue that this scene tells us.\u00a0</p><p>It tells us that Cyrus and TJ are on par\u00a0\u201cEating your feelings? I do that\u201d- Cyrus bottles things up/feels bad and eating is a comfort. It is metaphorical in the sense that you swallow and try to ignore your feelings, but also just feel like you need comfort so you turn to food (anxiety and depression does this!!)</p><p>It tells us that TJ isn\u2019t all that confident. He doesn\u2019t want people to know he is dumb, or that he has a\u00a0\u201cproblem\u201d- this topic I thought would arise with Jonah because of Andi and Cyrus both saying\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re Jonah Beck!\u201d claiming that by being that he has no flaws (we all know that\u2019s wrong). It must have hurt a little when Cyrus said to TJ about\u00a0\u201cHow can you be sad? You\u2019re the captain of the basketball team\u201d. Mere seconds before that scene TJ was telling Buffy that he didn\u2019t want Basketball euphemisms used with Math to suggest he only knows basketball- TJ wants to be smart; he is smart. He just needs to get around this obstacle, to own it and not let it get in his way.\u00a0</p><p>Jonah is still portrayed as being good at everything (aside from relationships but I\u2019ll just let that slide), even with his panic attacks, he is still a natural at everything he picks up. TJ is so much more with the fact that we learn he has this one obstacle that to me tells me that he fears what people think of him, that he doesn\u2019t actually like being that person, that maybe he has been put down in the past and maybe has a facade to protect him from stuff. I say this because the thing that really sets TJ at ease is when Cyrus tells him that his teacher can\u2019t fail him or judge him for his dyscalculia, that he is common. It suggests to me that TJ have been privy to people putting him down and he was scared of people (hence the kids that walk through) and his teacher doing that. He is known for his confidence, so I imagine that maybe he doesn\u2019t have such a good home-life or something and they reprimand him if he doesn\u2019t do well. He has to work, unlike all the others who run riot. The only other teen character that we see that has a job is Amber and it\u2019s to help pay and keep up her family. I wouldn\u2019t put it past that TJ is in a similar situation and that maybe his parents aren\u2019t the best, or maybe he has the one parent, who knows. It would be really cool to get more background on him!!!! But yeah, I think maybe here and in the swing scene TJ may have felt like a lost cause, that\u2019s why he had heightened hostility. Also, you see what I say about having a childhood? Having a job already indicates to us that he doesn\u2019t have the same freedom; he has responsibilities, and he doesn\u2019t act like a kid. His childhood may have been taken from him in some way.</p><p>This scene also tells us (I feel) with the difference between Buffy and Cyrus in relation to TJ. Buffy was saying and trying to do the exact same thing as Cyrus was saying: \u201cSo Buffy was right all along\u201d. Buffy\u2019s actions were just the wrong ones. She didn\u2019t get to know TJ, she didn\u2019t seem to care overly much either (and understandably so). There was a goal. I think she really had to know TJ to really help him in teaching methods. She did try, and she did try understanding with searching into dyscalculia etc, but Cyrus was so much more open and calm&hellip; He also knows TJ on a different level because of their similarities and interactions etc. Cyrus has also put in the effort and seen TJ for who he is without any one telling him otherwise. Cyrus\u2019 reaction to TJ saying he has dyscalculia is the best reaction, it\u2019s like he was just learning another casual thing about him, there was no surprise, no pity, just plain\u00a0\u201cyeah, and?&hellip;\u201d attitude.\u00a0</p><p>This approach is just so different, and I think that\u2019s why TJ really appreciates it. It\u2019s chilled out, it\u2019s like it\u2019s the most casual thing in the world, as it should be. It\u2019s so funny though because TJ is all about helping Cyrus own himself, building him up and here Cyrus is, doing that for TJ. Buffy was trying to tell TJ all this but it was lost. Their hostility clouded it. Cyrus was the middle ground. TJ didn\u2019t want to impress Buffy or anything, he had a goal, just like Buffy did with tutoring. TJ and Buffy really aren\u2019t the endgame. That is made clear when TJ tells Cyrus that <i>he </i>is the one that helped him, not Buffy. That is what the fortune teller meant, but Cyrus is so much more than just a friend. That I think starts to change here, and then as time goes on and finally with the look back bit and rap. That is where things properly change between those two mostly. Cyrus is constantly surprised by TJ, but it means more when it\u2019s for a friend also&hellip; That is the moment I believe that Cyrus fell for TJ, but for TJ, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s just been a slow build, but this scene here when he reveals he had Dyscalculia says a lot.</p><p>Finally, I wanted to say about what I stated earlier about Buffy saying that Cyrus can\u2019t do something. Honestly, both Buffy and Andi have no faith sometimes with Cyrus, and that\u2019s very sad. I don\u2019t know whether that will be addressed, or Buffy and Andi just cotton on to\u00a0\u201cOh, Cyrus is becoming more comfortable and confident with himself, that\u2019s nice. Maybe he <i>can </i>do that\u201d (most likely the latter but we\u2019ll see). They can be a little selfish and yeah, they can just have very little faith in Cyrus which isn\u2019t fair because as (best) friends you are meant to support each other.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah. To finish off that last scene with TJ and Cyrus, I forgot to say about how it ends. Cyrus also was getting worried and Cyrus was also open about that&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c5eae5c563ddcaaba121fb0307311aa/tumblr_inline_pf0a3wWzeA1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>and TJ reassured him, tells him he was the one that helped the most.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b08df7b68fb84d23d02b3fd2c7f48b7d/tumblr_inline_pf0a7q7RIl1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"/></figure><p>I think what sets this scene apart from his therapy session with Amber and Buffy is how unforced this was, like everything with TJ and Cyrus.

I think this is because TJ is just broody in this situation. This is the start of his redemption. But I think at the end of the day, it can be encouraging, it can also be metaphorical because he is putting Cyrus out of his comfort zone, but Cyrus wanted that in the first place.\u00a0</p><p>I think this scene is made better by the fact that TJ actually looks to Buffy briefly when Cyrus disturbs the crowd like\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to help him?\u201d\u00a0 or it\u2019s just to the crowd in general.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd86ca87062213ec27f75dbda35b37c7/tumblr_inline_pf0hj75UxG1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>He jumps in himself, getting Cyrus his muffin.

It was just Cyrus in general as well.</p><p>Anyway, so moving on I guess.</p><p>We then also have the Swing scene (\u2764\u2764)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/117b95972d2f5e1719687a402cd093ae/tumblr_inline_pf06woJxzW1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d31cb09093506258fb2f2957a5dd98be/tumblr_inline_pf06wq8r7n1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fd0455503a3acf44debbc47044cdc4c/tumblr_inline_pf06zj6Qhu1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>(sorry for poor quality, but you get the idea)</p><p>I mean, TJ is literally pushing Cyrus\u2026 on a swing.</p><p>Again, TJ\u2019s facade falters here as well, when Cyrus calls him\u00a0\u201cscary basketball guy\u201d TJ introduces himself and it was like he was uncomfortable; he doesn\u2019t like that title. Honestly, he\u2019s just so soft in this scene. <i>He even giggles!\u00a0</i></p><p>The whole\u00a0\u201cSwing\u201d is a metaphor anyway. Cyrus goes there because it makes him feel better about himself, he reassures himself and that\u2019s what it stands for, self-love I guess, it\u2019s also just a break from anxiety. So the fact that TJ says about Cyrus reminding him to swing again means that he has gained some happiness again. It also fits in with the theme of not letting people get to them (I will reference this again later).\u00a0</p><p>But also my first thought when I watched this scene was I thought the swing was a reference to childhood; also how TJ was speaking and Cyrus\u2019 little songs made things seem childish. So maybe it was a reference to nostalgia (like most symbolism\u2019s of swings), goes into a theory I have about TJ anyway as well.\u00a0</p><p>The thing with swings is that they come back. That\u2019s another thing. One of them (TJ) pushes, but the other (Cyrus is always there). The muffin scene, TJ pushes him forward, TJ ends up having to put himself next to Cyrus as well to really help. Then with the swings TJ is pushing Cyrus, but Cyrus is coming back to him. There is something about TJ also doing the underdog thing as well, he starts off behind Cyrus (having his back), then the underdog thing, he is then facing Cyrus, still pushing him, encouraging him. Honestly it\u2019s so sweet\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was exhilarating!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWant another one?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo thank you\u201d<br></p><p>*pouts*\u00a0\u201cToo bad\u201d *does it again with a cute side giggle*</p><p>The fact that TJ calls Cyrus underdog is so freaking sweet as well because it combines the swing scene and also the muffin scene (in my opinion), because in the muffin scene he stood up and kind of routed for Cyrus (\u201drouting for the underdog\u201d) and then it\u2019s just a reference to the swings where TJ performs an\u00a0\u201cunderdog\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The way the swing scene ends with Cyrus leaving is really nice too. To be honest, those two interactions with Cyrus and TJ so far are with Cyrus making his own decisions. He wanted that muffin and was okay with him doing it himself, then here Cyrus was offering TJ someone to talk to, to confide in without prompt, he had already made the decision to befriend TJ. The swing scene is where Cyrus sees right through TJ because he recognises that he also needs some uplifting.That\u2019s another thing with them both, they aren\u2019t so different, and that fact is what gets TJ to confide in Cyrus every time. Cyrus is a little more free in the respect that he makes it clear when he\u2019s nervous/anxious.\u00a0</p><p>He owns it and that\u2019s part in parcel to what Cyrus\u2019 arc is about; owning himself, which just so happens to be what TJ helps with on first interaction\u2026</p><p>Then the final\u00a0\u201cshoving\u201d scene.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e12ac580a50be72ef6724e539778ee42/tumblr_inline_pf07qwBrxs1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>This is wwaaaaayyyyyy more friendly, playful and encouraging compared to the one in the muffin scene. I honestly think it was meant to parallel it. Cyrus wasn\u2019t walking in, but TJ\u2019s expression and the situation is just way to light to not be friendly and encouraging. It is just a direct parallel situation anyway with TJ helping Cyrus how to somersault is the exact same as TJ helping Cyrus to get the muffin. The context is different now; they know each other, they\u2019re friends and they are getting closer.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah.\u00a0</p><p>So what about Cyrus? This next situation is where both of them metaphorically push.</p><p>It\u2019s when TJ tells Cyrus about his Dyscalculia.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29e6691871dacb842b1fc77cfe82f863/tumblr_inline_pf0809VBCt1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33ead95dfb2180d3368ed7a23e61c409/tumblr_inline_pf0807WzRm1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>TJ is being broody, to Cyrus of all people, and the amazing thing is that Cyrus already knows TJ well enough to know that he doesn\u2019t mean it. When I first saw Cyrus put his hand on the rail, I thought it was TJ\u2019s arm (a girl can dream, I\u2019m sorry) but yeah, Cryus was reaching out because he knew TJ wasn\u2019t okay, but because TJ hates the idea of having dyscalculia, feeling like he\u2019s dumb and thinks he is looked down upon, he takes it out on people; pushing them away. We see this as TJ walks away from Cyrus. He was the same with Buffy, and Buffy pushed too, but there is something more against why he was the way he was with Buffy, and also Buffy\u2019s response as well could\u2019ve been better. Plus Buffy here in this scene was rubbing it in TJ\u2019s face. <i>Not good.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76477211cb60970334b157f960d5bfbb/tumblr_inline_pf085kXULA1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>Cyrus is practically un-phased, maybe a little disheartened, but he stays where he is; by the rails almost to let TJ know that he is still there.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d69544d4083ac1d2ce7734ed1218e67/tumblr_inline_pf0880VbU21tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t give up though, he goes after TJ, he pushes himself in as TJ pushes him away.

If there is anything that confirms Tyrus (other than the cast saying that TJ looking back was deffo to Cyrus) I would argue that this scene tells us.\u00a0</p><p>It tells us that Cyrus and TJ are on par\u00a0\u201cEating your feelings? I do that\u201d- Cyrus bottles things up/feels bad and eating is a comfort. It is metaphorical in the sense that you swallow and try to ignore your feelings, but also just feel like you need comfort so you turn to food (anxiety and depression does this!!)</p><p>It tells us that TJ isn\u2019t all that confident. He doesn\u2019t want people to know he is dumb, or that he has a\u00a0\u201cproblem\u201d- this topic I thought would arise with Jonah because of Andi and Cyrus both saying\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re Jonah Beck!\u201d claiming that by being that he has no flaws (we all know that\u2019s wrong). It must have hurt a little when Cyrus said to TJ about\u00a0\u201cHow can you be sad? You\u2019re the captain of the basketball team\u201d. Mere seconds before that scene TJ was telling Buffy that he didn\u2019t want Basketball euphemisms used with Math to suggest he only knows basketball- TJ wants to be smart; he is smart. He just needs to get around this obstacle, to own it and not let it get in his way.\u00a0</p><p>Jonah is still portrayed as being good at everything (aside from relationships but I\u2019ll just let that slide), even with his panic attacks, he is still a natural at everything he picks up. TJ is so much more with the fact that we learn he has this one obstacle that to me tells me that he fears what people think of him, that he doesn\u2019t actually like being that person, that maybe he has been put down in the past and maybe has a facade to protect him from stuff. I say this because the thing that really sets TJ at ease is when Cyrus tells him that his teacher can\u2019t fail him or judge him for his dyscalculia, that he is common. It suggests to me that TJ have been privy to people putting him down and he was scared of people (hence the kids that walk through) and his teacher doing that. He is known for his confidence, so I imagine that maybe he doesn\u2019t have such a good home-life or something and they reprimand him if he doesn\u2019t do well. He has to work, unlike all the others who run riot. The only other teen character that we see that has a job is Amber and it\u2019s to help pay and keep up her family. I wouldn\u2019t put it past that TJ is in a similar situation and that maybe his parents aren\u2019t the best, or maybe he has the one parent, who knows. It would be really cool to get more background on him!!!! But yeah, I think maybe here and in the swing scene TJ may have felt like a lost cause, that\u2019s why he had heightened hostility. Also, you see what I say about having a childhood? Having a job already indicates to us that he doesn\u2019t have the same freedom; he has responsibilities, and he doesn\u2019t act like a kid. His childhood may have been taken from him in some way.</p><p>This scene also tells us (I feel) with the difference between Buffy and Cyrus in relation to TJ. Buffy was saying and trying to do the exact same thing as Cyrus was saying: \u201cSo Buffy was right all along\u201d. Buffy\u2019s actions were just the wrong ones. She didn\u2019t get to know TJ, she didn\u2019t seem to care overly much either (and understandably so). There was a goal. I think she really had to know TJ to really help him in teaching methods. She did try, and she did try understanding with searching into dyscalculia etc, but Cyrus was so much more open and calm\u2026 He also knows TJ on a different level because of their similarities and interactions etc. Cyrus has also put in the effort and seen TJ for who he is without any one telling him otherwise. Cyrus\u2019 reaction to TJ saying he has dyscalculia is the best reaction, it\u2019s like he was just learning another casual thing about him, there was no surprise, no pity, just plain\u00a0\u201cyeah, and?\u2026\u201d attitude.\u00a0</p><p>This approach is just so different, and I think that\u2019s why TJ really appreciates it. It\u2019s chilled out, it\u2019s like it\u2019s the most casual thing in the world, as it should be. It\u2019s so funny though because TJ is all about helping Cyrus own himself, building him up and here Cyrus is, doing that for TJ. Buffy was trying to tell TJ all this but it was lost. Their hostility clouded it. Cyrus was the middle ground. TJ didn\u2019t want to impress Buffy or anything, he had a goal, just like Buffy did with tutoring. TJ and Buffy really aren\u2019t the endgame. That is made clear when TJ tells Cyrus that <i>he </i>is the one that helped him, not Buffy. That is what the fortune teller meant, but Cyrus is so much more than just a friend. That I think starts to change here, and then as time goes on and finally with the look back bit and rap. That is where things properly change between those two mostly. Cyrus is constantly surprised by TJ, but it means more when it\u2019s for a friend also\u2026 That is the moment I believe that Cyrus fell for TJ, but for TJ, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s just been a slow build, but this scene here when he reveals he had Dyscalculia says a lot.</p><p>Finally, I wanted to say about what I stated earlier about Buffy saying that Cyrus can\u2019t do something. Honestly, both Buffy and Andi have no faith sometimes with Cyrus, and that\u2019s very sad. I don\u2019t know whether that will be addressed, or Buffy and Andi just cotton on to\u00a0\u201cOh, Cyrus is becoming more comfortable and confident with himself, that\u2019s nice. Maybe he <i>can </i>do that\u201d (most likely the latter but we\u2019ll see). They can be a little selfish and yeah, they can just have very little faith in Cyrus which isn\u2019t fair because as (best) friends you are meant to support each other.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah. To finish off that last scene with TJ and Cyrus, I forgot to say about how it ends. Cyrus also was getting worried and Cyrus was also open about that\u2026</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c5eae5c563ddcaaba121fb0307311aa/tumblr_inline_pf0a3wWzeA1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>and TJ reassured him, tells him he was the one that helped the most.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b08df7b68fb84d23d02b3fd2c7f48b7d/tumblr_inline_pf0a7q7RIl1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>I think what sets this scene apart from his therapy session with Amber and Buffy is how unforced this was, like everything with TJ and Cyrus.

I\u2019ve seen posts that comment on how they are there for each other, how they build each other up etc. I\u2019m kind of going to add to that in a way.</p><p>Anyway, so I noticed how TJ shoves Cyrus (not in a bad way); in a metaphorical and physical way. Cyrus also does it, but in a different way, but I\u2019ll talk about that last.</p><p>So first let\u2019s go to the Muffin scene.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s their first interaction and TJ immediately decides to teach Cyrus. Already that\u2019s giving him more of an attachment to him, rather than keeping his distance and just getting what he wants; Buffy\u2019s tuition. That would have meant him just getting the muffin and be done with it..\u00a0</p><p>This already sets up TJ to be a nicer person than what he comes across as. It\u2019s not that he was lazy, because that is emphasised by what he does; that he is kind.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6d819832fab0124ca656764de3a2591/tumblr_inline_pf05zjstUX1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9010c22b8b84e3719d2731de16b76b46/tumblr_inline_pf05znjH2S1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>I\u2019m sorry, but Cyrus\u2019 face is priceless.

That is honestly so lovely. I have a theory about TJ anyway in relation to that statement that I might mention later (honestly the muffin scene links to everything with Tyrus).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e1a40667d8fb4077f982b1ab26826b40/tumblr_inline_pf068tHP2j1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>Buffy\u2019s reaction, she knew she said the wrong thing probably.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5e6bc8e79835a206dc925acd720c3fe/tumblr_inline_pf06a3QpPU1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>Ignore the hilarious facial expressions it was the best I could do, but TJ gives Cyrus a push/shove. I would like to say that this is <i>after </i>Cyrus is already moving, meaning it\u2019s not that harsh, though it could easily come across as impatience on TJ\u2019s behalf. I think this is because TJ is just broody in this situation. This is the start of his redemption. But I think at the end of the day, it can be encouraging, it can also be metaphorical because he is putting Cyrus out of his comfort zone, but Cyrus wanted that in the first place.\u00a0</p><p>I think this scene is made better by the fact that TJ actually looks to Buffy briefly when Cyrus disturbs the crowd like\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to help him?\u201d\u00a0 or it\u2019s just to the crowd in general.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd86ca87062213ec27f75dbda35b37c7/tumblr_inline_pf0hj75UxG1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>He jumps in himself, getting Cyrus his muffin. He still lets Cyrus be the one to take it, he wasn\u2019t that impatient to the extent that he could have just picked it up and shoved it into Cyrus\u2019 hands. It was still a win for Cyrus, TJ just happened to back him up, he was with Cyrus (team/equals visual).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45634ffa96ead461a7b01d31baa107f1/tumblr_inline_pf06tkJTN51tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/199a850ed5ecfad37920242a71be35fb/tumblr_inline_pf06tklM7w1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>Also I find it hilarious how many times TJ tries not to smile, like his facade of the confident, laid-back school bully falters as he smiles, he\u2019s grinning when he goes to Buffy and I want to say that it\u2019s both because he succeeded in his task <i>and </i>was able to prove himself for Buffy\u2019s tuition. It was just Cyrus in general as well.</p><p>Anyway, so moving on I guess.</p><p>We then also have the Swing scene (\u2764\u2764)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/117b95972d2f5e1719687a402cd093ae/tumblr_inline_pf06woJxzW1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d31cb09093506258fb2f2957a5dd98be/tumblr_inline_pf06wq8r7n1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fd0455503a3acf44debbc47044cdc4c/tumblr_inline_pf06zj6Qhu1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>(sorry for poor quality, but you get the idea)</p><p>I mean, TJ is literally pushing Cyrus\u2026 on a swing.</p><p>Again, TJ\u2019s facade falters here as well, when Cyrus calls him\u00a0\u201cscary basketball guy\u201d TJ introduces himself and it was like he was uncomfortable; he doesn\u2019t like that title. Honestly, he\u2019s just so soft in this scene. <i>He even giggles!\u00a0</i></p><p>The whole\u00a0\u201cSwing\u201d is a metaphor anyway. Cyrus goes there because it makes him feel better about himself, he reassures himself and that\u2019s what it stands for, self-love I guess, it\u2019s also just a break from anxiety. So the fact that TJ says about Cyrus reminding him to swing again means that he has gained some happiness again. It also fits in with the theme of not letting people get to them (I will reference this again later).\u00a0</p><p>But also my first thought when I watched this scene was I thought the swing was a reference to childhood; also how TJ was speaking and Cyrus\u2019 little songs made things seem childish. So maybe it was a reference to nostalgia (like most symbolism\u2019s of swings), goes into a theory I have about TJ anyway as well.\u00a0</p><p>The thing with swings is that they come back. That\u2019s another thing. One of them (TJ) pushes, but the other (Cyrus is always there). The muffin scene, TJ pushes him forward, TJ ends up having to put himself next to Cyrus as well to really help. Then with the swings TJ is pushing Cyrus, but Cyrus is coming back to him. There is something about TJ also doing the underdog thing as well, he starts off behind Cyrus (having his back), then the underdog thing, he is then facing Cyrus, still pushing him, encouraging him. Honestly it\u2019s so sweet\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was exhilarating!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWant another one?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo thank you\u201d<br></p><p>*pouts*\u00a0\u201cToo bad\u201d *does it again with a cute side giggle*</p><p>The fact that TJ calls Cyrus underdog is so freaking sweet as well because it combines the swing scene and also the muffin scene (in my opinion), because in the muffin scene he stood up and kind of routed for Cyrus (\u201drouting for the underdog\u201d) and then it\u2019s just a reference to the swings where TJ performs an\u00a0\u201cunderdog\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The way the swing scene ends with Cyrus leaving is really nice too. To be honest, those two interactions with Cyrus and TJ so far are with Cyrus making his own decisions. He wanted that muffin and was okay with him doing it himself, then here Cyrus was offering TJ someone to talk to, to confide in without prompt, he had already made the decision to befriend TJ. The swing scene is where Cyrus sees right through TJ because he recognises that he also needs some uplifting.That\u2019s another thing with them both, they aren\u2019t so different, and that fact is what gets TJ to confide in Cyrus every time. Cyrus is a little more free in the respect that he makes it clear when he\u2019s nervous/anxious.\u00a0</p><p>He owns it and that\u2019s part in parcel to what Cyrus\u2019 arc is about; owning himself, which just so happens to be what TJ helps with on first interaction\u2026</p><p>Then the final\u00a0\u201cshoving\u201d scene.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e12ac580a50be72ef6724e539778ee42/tumblr_inline_pf07qwBrxs1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>This is wwaaaaayyyyyy more friendly, playful and encouraging compared to the one in the muffin scene. I honestly think it was meant to parallel it. Cyrus wasn\u2019t walking in, but TJ\u2019s expression and the situation is just way to light to not be friendly and encouraging. It is just a direct parallel situation anyway with TJ helping Cyrus how to somersault is the exact same as TJ helping Cyrus to get the muffin. The context is different now; they know each other, they\u2019re friends and they are getting closer.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah.\u00a0</p><p>So what about Cyrus? This next situation is where both of them metaphorically push.</p><p>It\u2019s when TJ tells Cyrus about his Dyscalculia.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29e6691871dacb842b1fc77cfe82f863/tumblr_inline_pf0809VBCt1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33ead95dfb2180d3368ed7a23e61c409/tumblr_inline_pf0807WzRm1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>TJ is being broody, to Cyrus of all people, and the amazing thing is that Cyrus already knows TJ well enough to know that he doesn\u2019t mean it. When I first saw Cyrus put his hand on the rail, I thought it was TJ\u2019s arm (a girl can dream, I\u2019m sorry) but yeah, Cryus was reaching out because he knew TJ wasn\u2019t okay, but because TJ hates the idea of having dyscalculia, feeling like he\u2019s dumb and thinks he is looked down upon, he takes it out on people; pushing them away. We see this as TJ walks away from Cyrus. He was the same with Buffy, and Buffy pushed too, but there is something more against why he was the way he was with Buffy, and also Buffy\u2019s response as well could\u2019ve been better. Plus Buffy here in this scene was rubbing it in TJ\u2019s face. <i>Not good.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76477211cb60970334b157f960d5bfbb/tumblr_inline_pf085kXULA1tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>Cyrus is practically un-phased, maybe a little disheartened, but he stays where he is; by the rails almost to let TJ know that he is still there.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d69544d4083ac1d2ce7734ed1218e67/tumblr_inline_pf0880VbU21tlt5c9_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1366\"></figure><p>Cyrus doesn\u2019t give up though, he goes after TJ, he pushes himself in as TJ pushes him away.

If there is anything that confirms Tyrus (other than the cast saying that TJ looking back was deffo to Cyrus) I would argue that this scene tells us.\u00a0</p><p>It tells us that Cyrus and TJ are on par\u00a0\u201cEating your feelings? I do that\u201d- Cyrus bottles things up/feels bad and eating is a comfort. It is metaphorical in the sense that you swallow and try to ignore your feelings, but also just feel like you need comfort so you turn to food (anxiety and depression does this!!)</p><p>It tells us that TJ isn\u2019t all that confident. He doesn\u2019t want people to know he is dumb, or that he has a\u00a0\u201cproblem\u201d- this topic I thought would arise with Jonah because of Andi and Cyrus both saying\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re Jonah Beck!\u201d claiming that by being that he has no flaws (we all know that\u2019s wrong). It must have hurt a little when Cyrus said to TJ about\u00a0\u201cHow can you be sad? You\u2019re the captain of the basketball team\u201d. Mere seconds before that scene TJ was telling Buffy that he didn\u2019t want Basketball euphemisms used with Math to suggest he only knows basketball- TJ wants to be smart; he is smart. He just needs to get around this obstacle, to own it and not let it get in his way.\u00a0</p><p>Jonah is still portrayed as being good at everything (aside from relationships but I\u2019ll just let that slide), even with his panic attacks, he is still a natural at everything he picks up. TJ is so much more with the fact that we learn he has this one obstacle that to me tells me that he fears what people think of him, that he doesn\u2019t actually like being that person, that maybe he has been put down in the past and maybe has a facade to protect him from stuff. I say this because the thing that really sets TJ at ease is when Cyrus tells him that his teacher can\u2019t fail him or judge him for his dyscalculia, that he is common. It suggests to me that TJ have been privy to people putting him down and he was scared of people (hence the kids that walk through) and his teacher doing that. He is known for his confidence, so I imagine that maybe he doesn\u2019t have such a good home-life or something and they reprimand him if he doesn\u2019t do well. He has to work, unlike all the others who run riot. The only other teen character that we see that has a job is Amber and it\u2019s to help pay and keep up her family. I wouldn\u2019t put it past that TJ is in a similar situation and that maybe his parents aren\u2019t the best, or maybe he has the one parent, who knows. It would be really cool to get more background on him!!!! But yeah, I think maybe here and in the swing scene TJ may have felt like a lost cause, that\u2019s why he had heightened hostility. Also, you see what I say about having a childhood? Having a job already indicates to us that he doesn\u2019t have the same freedom; he has responsibilities, and he doesn\u2019t act like a kid. His childhood may have been taken from him in some way.</p><p>This scene also tells us (I feel) with the difference between Buffy and Cyrus in relation to TJ. Buffy was saying and trying to do the exact same thing as Cyrus was saying: \u201cSo Buffy was right all along\u201d. Buffy\u2019s actions were just the wrong ones. She didn\u2019t get to know TJ, she didn\u2019t seem to care overly much either (and understandably so). There was a goal. I think she really had to know TJ to really help him in teaching methods. She did try, and she did try understanding with searching into dyscalculia etc, but Cyrus was so much more open and calm\u2026 He also knows TJ on a different level because of their similarities and interactions etc. Cyrus has also put in the effort and seen TJ for who he is without any one telling him otherwise. Cyrus\u2019 reaction to TJ saying he has dyscalculia is the best reaction, it\u2019s like he was just learning another casual thing about him, there was no surprise, no pity, just plain\u00a0\u201cyeah, and?\u2026\u201d attitude.\u00a0</p><p>This approach is just so different, and I think that\u2019s why TJ really appreciates it. It\u2019s chilled out, it\u2019s like it\u2019s the most casual thing in the world, as it should be. It\u2019s so funny though because TJ is all about helping Cyrus own himself, building him up and here Cyrus is, doing that for TJ. Buffy was trying to tell TJ all this but it was lost. Their hostility clouded it. Cyrus was the middle ground. TJ didn\u2019t want to impress Buffy or anything, he had a goal, just like Buffy did with tutoring. TJ and Buffy really aren\u2019t the endgame. That is made clear when TJ tells Cyrus that <i>he </i>is the one that helped him, not Buffy. That is what the fortune teller meant, but Cyrus is so much more than just a friend. That I think starts to change here, and then as time goes on and finally with the look back bit and rap. That is where things properly change between those two mostly. Cyrus is constantly surprised by TJ, but it means more when it\u2019s for a friend also\u2026 That is the moment I believe that Cyrus fell for TJ, but for TJ, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s just been a slow build, but this scene here when he reveals he had Dyscalculia says a lot.</p><p>Finally, I wanted to say about what I stated earlier about Buffy saying that Cyrus can\u2019t do something. Honestly, both Buffy and Andi have no faith sometimes with Cyrus, and that\u2019s very sad. I don\u2019t know whether that will be addressed, or Buffy and Andi just cotton on to\u00a0\u201cOh, Cyrus is becoming more comfortable and confident with himself, that\u2019s nice. Maybe he <i>can </i>do that\u201d (most likely the latter but we\u2019ll see). They can be a little selfish and yeah, they can just have very little faith in Cyrus which isn\u2019t fair because as (best) friends you are meant to support each other.\u00a0</p><p>So yeah.

                "content": "<p>So I&rsquo;m really not a huge part of the Andi Mack fandom, I have just finished watching it during it&rsquo;s hiatus and then because I picked up on Tyrus I wanted to see what other people have said about their scenes and I noticed some stuff and I wanted to share it because I&rsquo;m really bad about containing myself with this sort of stuff and I haven&rsquo;t seen this exact stuff being said &#128514;&#128517;</p><p>Okay so we all know that there are limited scenes with Tyrus as a whole, but the ones we do see I find are always meaningful and hint to their endgame/relationship. I&rsquo;ve seen posts that comment on how they are there for each other, how they build each other up etc. I&rsquo;m kind of going to add to that in a way.</p><p>Anyway, so I noticed how TJ shoves Cyrus (not in a bad way); in a metaphorical and physical way. Cyrus also does it, but in a different way, but I&rsquo;ll talk about that last.</p><p>So first let&rsquo;s go to the Muffin scene.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s their first interaction and TJ immediately decides to teach Cyrus. Already that&rsquo;s giving him more of an attachment to him, rather than keeping his distance and just getting what he wants; Buffy&rsquo;s tuition. That would have meant him just getting the muffin and be done with it..&nbsp;</p><p>This already sets up TJ to be a nicer person than what he comes across as. It&rsquo;s not that he was lazy, because that is emphasised by what he does; that he is kind.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6d819832fab0124ca656764de3a2591/tumblr_inline_pf05zjstUX1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9010c22b8b84e3719d2731de16b76b46/tumblr_inline_pf05znjH2S1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but Cyrus&rsquo; face is priceless.

That is honestly so lovely. I have a theory about TJ anyway in relation to that statement that I might mention later (honestly the muffin scene links to everything with Tyrus).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e1a40667d8fb4077f982b1ab26826b40/tumblr_inline_pf068tHP2j1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Buffy&rsquo;s reaction, she knew she said the wrong thing probably.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5e6bc8e79835a206dc925acd720c3fe/tumblr_inline_pf06a3QpPU1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Ignore the hilarious facial expressions it was the best I could do, but TJ gives Cyrus a push/shove. I would like to say that this is <i>after </i>Cyrus is already moving, meaning it&rsquo;s not that harsh, though it could easily come across as impatience on TJ&rsquo;s behalf. I think this is because TJ is just broody in this situation. This is the start of his redemption. But I think at the end of the day, it can be encouraging, it can also be metaphorical because he is putting Cyrus out of his comfort zone, but Cyrus wanted that in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this scene is made better by the fact that TJ actually looks to Buffy briefly when Cyrus disturbs the crowd like&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to help him?&rdquo;&nbsp; or it&rsquo;s just to the crowd in general.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd86ca87062213ec27f75dbda35b37c7/tumblr_inline_pf0hj75UxG1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>He jumps in himself, getting Cyrus his muffin. He still lets Cyrus be the one to take it, he wasn&rsquo;t that impatient to the extent that he could have just picked it up and shoved it into Cyrus&rsquo; hands. It was still a win for Cyrus, TJ just happened to back him up, he was with Cyrus (team/equals visual).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45634ffa96ead461a7b01d31baa107f1/tumblr_inline_pf06tkJTN51tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/199a850ed5ecfad37920242a71be35fb/tumblr_inline_pf06tklM7w1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Also I find it hilarious how many times TJ tries not to smile, like his facade of the confident, laid-back school bully falters as he smiles, he&rsquo;s grinning when he goes to Buffy and I want to say that it&rsquo;s both because he succeeded in his task <i>and </i>was able to prove himself for Buffy&rsquo;s tuition. It was just Cyrus in general as well.</p><p>Anyway, so moving on I guess.</p><p>We then also have the Swing scene (&#10084;&#10084;)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/117b95972d2f5e1719687a402cd093ae/tumblr_inline_pf06woJxzW1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d31cb09093506258fb2f2957a5dd98be/tumblr_inline_pf06wq8r7n1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fd0455503a3acf44debbc47044cdc4c/tumblr_inline_pf06zj6Qhu1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(sorry for poor quality, but you get the idea)</p><p>I mean, TJ is literally pushing Cyrus&hellip; on a swing.</p><p>Again, TJ&rsquo;s facade falters here as well, when Cyrus calls him&nbsp;&ldquo;scary basketball guy&rdquo; TJ introduces himself and it was like he was uncomfortable; he doesn&rsquo;t like that title. Honestly, he&rsquo;s just so soft in this scene. <i>He even giggles!&nbsp;</i></p><p>The whole&nbsp;&ldquo;Swing&rdquo; is a metaphor anyway. Cyrus goes there because it makes him feel better about himself, he reassures himself and that&rsquo;s what it stands for, self-love I guess, it&rsquo;s also just a break from anxiety. So the fact that TJ says about Cyrus reminding him to swing again means that he has gained some happiness again. It also fits in with the theme of not letting people get to them (I will reference this again later).&nbsp;</p><p>But also my first thought when I watched this scene was I thought the swing was a reference to childhood; also how TJ was speaking and Cyrus&rsquo; little songs made things seem childish. So maybe it was a reference to nostalgia (like most symbolism&rsquo;s of swings), goes into a theory I have about TJ anyway as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing with swings is that they come back. That&rsquo;s another thing. One of them (TJ) pushes, but the other (Cyrus is always there). The muffin scene, TJ pushes him forward, TJ ends up having to put himself next to Cyrus as well to really help. Then with the swings TJ is pushing Cyrus, but Cyrus is coming back to him. There is something about TJ also doing the underdog thing as well, he starts off behind Cyrus (having his back), then the underdog thing, he is then facing Cyrus, still pushing him, encouraging him. Honestly it&rsquo;s so sweet&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That was exhilarating!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Want another one?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No thank you&rdquo;<br /></p><p>*pouts*&nbsp;&ldquo;Too bad&rdquo; *does it again with a cute side giggle*</p><p>The fact that TJ calls Cyrus underdog is so freaking sweet as well because it combines the swing scene and also the muffin scene (in my opinion), because in the muffin scene he stood up and kind of routed for Cyrus (&rdquo;routing for the underdog&rdquo;) and then it&rsquo;s just a reference to the swings where TJ performs an&nbsp;&ldquo;underdog&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>The way the swing scene ends with Cyrus leaving is really nice too. To be honest, those two interactions with Cyrus and TJ so far are with Cyrus making his own decisions. He wanted that muffin and was okay with him doing it himself, then here Cyrus was offering TJ someone to talk to, to confide in without prompt, he had already made the decision to befriend TJ. The swing scene is where Cyrus sees right through TJ because he recognises that he also needs some uplifting.That&rsquo;s another thing with them both, they aren&rsquo;t so different, and that fact is what gets TJ to confide in Cyrus every time. Cyrus is a little more free in the respect that he makes it clear when he&rsquo;s nervous/anxious.&nbsp;</p><p>He owns it and that&rsquo;s part in parcel to what Cyrus&rsquo; arc is about; owning himself, which just so happens to be what TJ helps with on first interaction&hellip;</p><p>Then the final&nbsp;&ldquo;shoving&rdquo; scene.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e12ac580a50be72ef6724e539778ee42/tumblr_inline_pf07qwBrxs1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is wwaaaaayyyyyy more friendly, playful and encouraging compared to the one in the muffin scene. I honestly think it was meant to parallel it. Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t walking in, but TJ&rsquo;s expression and the situation is just way to light to not be friendly and encouraging. It is just a direct parallel situation anyway with TJ helping Cyrus how to somersault is the exact same as TJ helping Cyrus to get the muffin. The context is different now; they know each other, they&rsquo;re friends and they are getting closer.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>So what about Cyrus? This next situation is where both of them metaphorically push.</p><p>It&rsquo;s when TJ tells Cyrus about his Dyscalculia.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29e6691871dacb842b1fc77cfe82f863/tumblr_inline_pf0809VBCt1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33ead95dfb2180d3368ed7a23e61c409/tumblr_inline_pf0807WzRm1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>TJ is being broody, to Cyrus of all people, and the amazing thing is that Cyrus already knows TJ well enough to know that he doesn&rsquo;t mean it. When I first saw Cyrus put his hand on the rail, I thought it was TJ&rsquo;s arm (a girl can dream, I&rsquo;m sorry) but yeah, Cryus was reaching out because he knew TJ wasn&rsquo;t okay, but because TJ hates the idea of having dyscalculia, feeling like he&rsquo;s dumb and thinks he is looked down upon, he takes it out on people; pushing them away. We see this as TJ walks away from Cyrus. He was the same with Buffy, and Buffy pushed too, but there is something more against why he was the way he was with Buffy, and also Buffy&rsquo;s response as well could&rsquo;ve been better. Plus Buffy here in this scene was rubbing it in TJ&rsquo;s face. <i>Not good.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76477211cb60970334b157f960d5bfbb/tumblr_inline_pf085kXULA1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Cyrus is practically un-phased, maybe a little disheartened, but he stays where he is; by the rails almost to let TJ know that he is still there.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4d69544d4083ac1d2ce7734ed1218e67/tumblr_inline_pf0880VbU21tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Cyrus doesn&rsquo;t give up though, he goes after TJ, he pushes himself in as TJ pushes him away.

Cyrus enforces that by his words and actions when they actually talk.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ff0ef5d331aea30ed7573e0c012effd/tumblr_inline_pf089jwwJZ1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9aa3dbe3c4a9d3ee80ff641a533b43b6/tumblr_inline_pf08e1UXaw1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Cyrus sits like that for a reason; despite arms folded in front of him- Cyrus is casual and open.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1d03ab13f61b4ac0b9e85a1094c16a2/tumblr_inline_pf08gm6Fef1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/055a1de2ac37f22023f3d0104444e480/tumblr_inline_pf08goLovu1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This scene, honestly is beautiful. If there is anything that confirms Tyrus (other than the cast saying that TJ looking back was deffo to Cyrus) I would argue that this scene tells us.&nbsp;</p><p>It tells us that Cyrus and TJ are on par&nbsp;&ldquo;Eating your feelings? I do that&rdquo;- Cyrus bottles things up/feels bad and eating is a comfort. It is metaphorical in the sense that you swallow and try to ignore your feelings, but also just feel like you need comfort so you turn to food (anxiety and depression does this!!)</p><p>It tells us that TJ isn&rsquo;t all that confident. He doesn&rsquo;t want people to know he is dumb, or that he has a&nbsp;&ldquo;problem&rdquo;- this topic I thought would arise with Jonah because of Andi and Cyrus both saying&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jonah Beck!&rdquo; claiming that by being that he has no flaws (we all know that&rsquo;s wrong). It must have hurt a little when Cyrus said to TJ about&nbsp;&ldquo;How can you be sad? You&rsquo;re the captain of the basketball team&rdquo;. Mere seconds before that scene TJ was telling Buffy that he didn&rsquo;t want Basketball euphemisms used with Math to suggest he only knows basketball- TJ wants to be smart; he is smart. He just needs to get around this obstacle, to own it and not let it get in his way.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonah is still portrayed as being good at everything (aside from relationships but I&rsquo;ll just let that slide), even with his panic attacks, he is still a natural at everything he picks up. TJ is so much more with the fact that we learn he has this one obstacle that to me tells me that he fears what people think of him, that he doesn&rsquo;t actually like being that person, that maybe he has been put down in the past and maybe has a facade to protect him from stuff. I say this because the thing that really sets TJ at ease is when Cyrus tells him that his teacher can&rsquo;t fail him or judge him for his dyscalculia, that he is common. It suggests to me that TJ have been privy to people putting him down and he was scared of people (hence the kids that walk through) and his teacher doing that. He is known for his confidence, so I imagine that maybe he doesn&rsquo;t have such a good home-life or something and they reprimand him if he doesn&rsquo;t do well. He has to work, unlike all the others who run riot. The only other teen character that we see that has a job is Amber and it&rsquo;s to help pay and keep up her family. I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past that TJ is in a similar situation and that maybe his parents aren&rsquo;t the best, or maybe he has the one parent, who knows. It would be really cool to get more background on him!!!! But yeah, I think maybe here and in the swing scene TJ may have felt like a lost cause, that&rsquo;s why he had heightened hostility. Also, you see what I say about having a childhood? Having a job already indicates to us that he doesn&rsquo;t have the same freedom; he has responsibilities, and he doesn&rsquo;t act like a kid. His childhood may have been taken from him in some way.</p><p>This scene also tells us (I feel) with the difference between Buffy and Cyrus in relation to TJ. Buffy was saying and trying to do the exact same thing as Cyrus was saying: &ldquo;So Buffy was right all along&rdquo;. Buffy&rsquo;s actions were just the wrong ones. She didn&rsquo;t get to know TJ, she didn&rsquo;t seem to care overly much either (and understandably so). There was a goal. I think she really had to know TJ to really help him in teaching methods. She did try, and she did try understanding with searching into dyscalculia etc, but Cyrus was so much more open and calm&hellip; He also knows TJ on a different level because of their similarities and interactions etc. Cyrus has also put in the effort and seen TJ for who he is without any one telling him otherwise. Cyrus&rsquo; reaction to TJ saying he has dyscalculia is the best reaction, it&rsquo;s like he was just learning another casual thing about him, there was no surprise, no pity, just plain&nbsp;&ldquo;yeah, and?&hellip;&rdquo; attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>This approach is just so different, and I think that&rsquo;s why TJ really appreciates it. It&rsquo;s chilled out, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s the most casual thing in the world, as it should be. It&rsquo;s so funny though because TJ is all about helping Cyrus own himself, building him up and here Cyrus is, doing that for TJ. Buffy was trying to tell TJ all this but it was lost. Their hostility clouded it. Cyrus was the middle ground. TJ didn&rsquo;t want to impress Buffy or anything, he had a goal, just like Buffy did with tutoring. TJ and Buffy really aren&rsquo;t the endgame. That is made clear when TJ tells Cyrus that <i>he </i>is the one that helped him, not Buffy. That is what the fortune teller meant, but Cyrus is so much more than just a friend. That I think starts to change here, and then as time goes on and finally with the look back bit and rap. That is where things properly change between those two mostly. Cyrus is constantly surprised by TJ, but it means more when it&rsquo;s for a friend also&hellip; That is the moment I believe that Cyrus fell for TJ, but for TJ, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s just been a slow build, but this scene here when he reveals he had Dyscalculia says a lot.</p><p>Finally, I wanted to say about what I stated earlier about Buffy saying that Cyrus can&rsquo;t do something. Honestly, both Buffy and Andi have no faith sometimes with Cyrus, and that&rsquo;s very sad. I don&rsquo;t know whether that will be addressed, or Buffy and Andi just cotton on to&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Cyrus is becoming more comfortable and confident with himself, that&rsquo;s nice. Maybe he <i>can </i>do that&rdquo; (most likely the latter but we&rsquo;ll see). They can be a little selfish and yeah, they can just have very little faith in Cyrus which isn&rsquo;t fair because as (best) friends you are meant to support each other.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah. To finish off that last scene with TJ and Cyrus, I forgot to say about how it ends. Cyrus also was getting worried and Cyrus was also open about that&hellip;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c5eae5c563ddcaaba121fb0307311aa/tumblr_inline_pf0a3wWzeA1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>and TJ reassured him, tells him he was the one that helped the most.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b08df7b68fb84d23d02b3fd2c7f48b7d/tumblr_inline_pf0a7q7RIl1tlt5c9_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I think what sets this scene apart from his therapy session with Amber and Buffy is how unforced this was, like everything with TJ and Cyrus.
