She felt extremely nervous and dreaded what her mother had to say for herself.</p><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t you and Lyra use to be best friends in the day, darling? We all thought you two were conjoined at the hip,\u2019 her mother replied calmly, turning over the paper. \u2018I think it will be a marvellous opportunity for you to reconnect with some of your childhood friends. They can\u2019t all be wizards, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or witches,\u2019 responded Hermione reflexively. Sexism was still a prevailant thing that ran rampant among the magical world and Hermione was constantly irked at how much more restricting the world was for witches, so she\u2019d taken to correcting people on even the littlest things like saying wizards and not witches. She just wished there was a gender neutral term for the two.</p><p>\u2018You know what I mean,\u2019 said her mother, yawning. \u2018Now, why don\u2019t you go out for a little while and get some fresh air? It\u2019s bound to do you at least some good instead of you looking pale as a ghost.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s the middle of winter,\u2019 Hermione protested, but she tried, she really did, to grasp the door handle after she had donned her coat and everything, but no matter how hard she forced herself to open the door, she just couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>It had been like this ever since she got home. All Hermione wanted to do was snuggle up swathed in warm blankets with a few hot water bottles. She could have just used magic to make her room hotter- and she <i>longed</i> to, for she missed the euphoria of unlocking magic beneath her fingertips so very much- but she knew that it wouldn\u2019t be good for her so soon after the war. Harry, too, had taken the same approach to magic, and was now quietly travelling to places where he knew no one would recognise him. It was much harder for Ron, who had grown up with magic and wouldn\u2019t sacrifice it for anything, but even he flinched a little when he muttered certain spells and trembled whenever he had to raise his wand.</p><p><i>For it seemed that the magic had gone out of their lives, and it took all the joy they once had using it with it.</i></p><p>Hermione\u2019s hand faltered, and just like all the days before, she turned away from the door.</p><p>-</p><p>\u2018Won\u2019t you help us set the plates, then?\u2019 Hermione\u2019s father asked genially. </p><p>Hermione\u2019s breath stopped. The arrangement of china and silverware was set out in a most extraordinarily beautiful pattern. She suspected that it had been a while since her parents had guests over to pamper. Maybe they were all just looking for a distraction tonight. </p><p>Hermione nodded and took out the glassware, carefully arranging them to fit the theme. </p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Her hands stopped. </p><p>And shook.</p><p>The door was opened.</p><p>Chestnut curls with hints of caramel entered the room, framed across sharp features and high cheekbones and a razor sharp jaw. Molten bronze eyes were creased the same way as the cherry mouth which was supposed to resemble a smile, but didn\u2019t quite make it. </p><p>And oh so suddenly, those bronze eyes flitted to her direction.

It was surprisingly cold for August, and the breeze had made her shiver. Hermione had walked home alone. Lyra had stared at her bushy hair retreating from her window and wondered what on Earth she\u2019d done.</p><p>Her lips tried to part open to say something, anything, but she didn\u2019t have the words. So much had changed about Hermione. Her signature long, bushy hair and large front teeth were gone, replaced by soft curls and even teeth. She looked&hellip; somehow, battle-hardened and war-torn. As if she had been fighting for something she couldn\u2019t afford to lose. </p><p>The Grangers and the Clairi\u00e8res sat down to dinner awkwardly.

She felt extremely nervous and dreaded what her mother had to say for herself.</p><p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you and Lyra use to be best friends in the day, darling? We all thought you two were conjoined at the hip,&rsquo; her mother replied calmly, turning over the paper. &lsquo;I think it will be a marvellous opportunity for you to reconnect with some of your childhood friends. They can&rsquo;t all be wizards, you know.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Or witches,&rsquo; responded Hermione reflexively. Sexism was still a prevailant thing that ran rampant among the magical world and Hermione was constantly irked at how much more restricting the world was for witches, so she&rsquo;d taken to correcting people on even the littlest things like saying wizards and not witches. She just wished there was a gender neutral term for the two.</p><p>&lsquo;You know what I mean,&rsquo; said her mother, yawning. &lsquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t you go out for a little while and get some fresh air? It&rsquo;s bound to do you at least some good instead of you looking pale as a ghost.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the middle of winter,&rsquo; Hermione protested, but she tried, she really did, to grasp the door handle after she had donned her coat and everything, but no matter how hard she forced herself to open the door, she just couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p><p>It had been like this ever since she got home. All Hermione wanted to do was snuggle up swathed in warm blankets with a few hot water bottles. She could have just used magic to make her room hotter- and she <i>longed</i> to, for she missed the euphoria of unlocking magic beneath her fingertips so very much- but she knew that it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for her so soon after the war. Harry, too, had taken the same approach to magic, and was now quietly travelling to places where he knew no one would recognise him. It was much harder for Ron, who had grown up with magic and wouldn&rsquo;t sacrifice it for anything, but even he flinched a little when he muttered certain spells and trembled whenever he had to raise his wand.</p><p><i>For it seemed that the magic had gone out of their lives, and it took all the joy they once had using it with it.</i></p><p>Hermione&rsquo;s hand faltered, and just like all the days before, she turned away from the door.</p><p>-</p><p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you help us set the plates, then?&rsquo; Hermione&rsquo;s father asked genially. </p><p>Hermione&rsquo;s breath stopped. The arrangement of china and silverware was set out in a most extraordinarily beautiful pattern. She suspected that it had been a while since her parents had guests over to pamper. Maybe they were all just looking for a distraction tonight. </p><p>Hermione nodded and took out the glassware, carefully arranging them to fit the theme. </p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Her hands stopped. </p><p>And shook.</p><p>The door was opened.</p><p>Chestnut curls with hints of caramel entered the room, framed across sharp features and high cheekbones and a razor sharp jaw. Molten bronze eyes were creased the same way as the cherry mouth which was supposed to resemble a smile, but didn&rsquo;t quite make it. </p><p>And oh so suddenly, those bronze eyes flitted to her direction. And widened, ever so slightly, before assuming that reserved look about them once more. Cherry lips parted, and halted, and then said nothing. </p><p>-</p><p>Lyra Clairi&egrave;re was, for once in her life, at a loss for words. She was seeing her childhood best friend whom she hadn&rsquo;t had any contact with in over seven years. She still remembered, crystal-clear, that fateful night that their friendship had ended. It was surprisingly cold for August, and the breeze had made her shiver. Hermione had walked home alone. Lyra had stared at her bushy hair retreating from her window and wondered what on Earth she&rsquo;d done.</p><p>Her lips tried to part open to say something, anything, but she didn&rsquo;t have the words. So much had changed about Hermione. Her signature long, bushy hair and large front teeth were gone, replaced by soft curls and even teeth. She looked&hellip; somehow, battle-hardened and war-torn. As if she had been fighting for something she couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose. </p><p>The Grangers and the Clairi&egrave;res sat down to dinner awkwardly. Hermione&rsquo;s father offered her parents some mashed potatoes and they accepted gratefully, her father mentioning he was famished. </p><p>&lsquo;Hermione, darling, how have you been?&rsquo; her mother exclaimed. &lsquo;I remember you used to come over all the time before you went to boarding school- our guests practically assumed you lived there!&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been&hellip; well enough,&rsquo; Hermione said, but Lyra could tell she was lying through her teeth. Hermione spooned a heap of mashed potatoes into her mouth to avoid talking. &lsquo;Um, how have you been?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve been well-off, I suppose,&rsquo; Lyra&rsquo;s father laughed. &lsquo;I remember Lyra missed you so terribly much when you went to boarding school&hellip; didn&rsquo;t you, Lyra?&rsquo;</p><p>Lyra grimaced painfully and forced a laugh. &lsquo;Yes, Hermione made her own choices.&rsquo; </p><p>Hermione raised an eyebrow. That achingly familiar gesture made Lyra&rsquo;s heart skip. &lsquo;And what exactly is that supposed to mean?&rsquo;</p><p>Lyra cocked her head challengingly. &lsquo;I simply meant that you certainly thought you were capable of making life-changing decisions at age eleven, and&hellip; you did, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she heard Hermione muttering. &lsquo;Life-changing indeed.&rsquo; Then Hermione raised her voice. &lsquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s not like, according to someone, I had anyone to stay for, is it?&rsquo;</p><p>Lyra felt hot anger course through her. Even after all these years, Hermione still remembered exactly what she said&hellip; and that somehow made her bite her lip to keep from an involuntary smile spreading across her face. &lsquo;Well, maybe that someone didn&rsquo;t mean it, and just wanted to tell you all you had to do was stay. And&hellip; that they would really miss you. And wish you hadn&rsquo;t gone. Or something,&rsquo; Lyra finished, stammering a little.</p><p>Hermione looked at her with eyes that glinted like mysterious corners of shadowy caves, hiding everything and nothing all at once. </p><p>When she spoke, her voice cracked. </p><p>&lsquo;You would have missed me?&rsquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>(Stay tuned for Part 3 and follow me if you don&rsquo;t want to miss it!)</p></p>",

It's made pretty clear that MB is more than just a name, it's very much a 'racial slur' in HP, so I can't blame Lily for pulling back from Severus in a big way. Being maliciously called one of the worst words for who you are is horrendous, especially by someone she considered a friend and she's completely within her right to choose not to forgive. Not that she was right to call him Snivellus 1/2",

I&rsquo;m not particularly pro or anti Snape, hes an excellent character, and what we see is a very slanted view of things.

Sure, she knew he didn\u2019t like his parents and that he didn\u2019t want to go home, but Lily was a middle-class, relatively sheltered teenage girl, not a child support officer, or a social worker. Given that Severus probably never shared anything about his home life if he didn\u2019t absolutely have to, <i>with anybody</i>, I would actually doubt that she\u2019d know his home life was abusive at all, or at least not to the extent that it was - I feel that she probably just knew his parents weren\u2019t the best, and that he was very poor.\u00a0</p><p>How is she supposed to know what exactly informs Severus\u2019 low self esteem?

Lily Evans was one of the few people on the Hogwarts campus that James Potter would listen to, and she had the added authority of her prefect\u2019s badge, and she didn\u2019t yell at James, didn\u2019t nudge Remus to get him to stop, didn\u2019t use her prefect\u2019s authority, didn\u2019t go for a member of staff.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe she thought it was appropriate justice, or she thought somehow it\u2019d bring him back to the good side, I don\u2019t know, but it just seems like such a cruel and horrific thing to watch somebody, <i>anybody,</i>\u00a0go through, and to be able to laugh at, let alone somebody who had been your friend since you were young kids.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying that if she\u2019d stepped in that it would have stopped him from becoming a Death Eater or anything, I just think that SWM is one of <i>the</i>\u00a0most fucked up scenes that I\u2019ve ever seen, and the only scene I can really think of that grosses me out at a similar level is when the Death Eaters torture the Muggles at the Quidditch World Cup in Goblet of Fire.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe she watched and felt absolutely sick to her stomach, but was terrified he\u2019d lash out at her again and couldn\u2019t bear another emotional blow; maybe she was dealing with her feelings for James; maybe, again, she felt he deserved it.\u00a0</p><p>Like I said, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about Lily in terms of like, her own motivations and stuff.

Lily Evans was one of the few people on the Hogwarts campus that James Potter would listen to, and she had the added authority of her prefect\u2019s badge, and she didn\u2019t yell at James, didn\u2019t nudge Remus to get him to stop, didn\u2019t use her prefect\u2019s authority, didn\u2019t go for a member of staff.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe she thought it was appropriate justice, or she thought somehow it\u2019d bring him back to the good side, I don\u2019t know, but it just seems like such a cruel and horrific thing to watch somebody, <i>anybody,</i>\u00a0go through, and to be able to laugh at, let alone somebody who had been your friend since you were young kids.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying that if she\u2019d stepped in that it would have stopped him from becoming a Death Eater or anything, I just think that SWM is one of <i>the</i>\u00a0most fucked up scenes that I\u2019ve ever seen, and the only scene I can really think of that grosses me out at a similar level is when the Death Eaters torture the Muggles at the Quidditch World Cup in Goblet of Fire.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe she watched and felt absolutely sick to her stomach, but was terrified he\u2019d lash out at her again and couldn\u2019t bear another emotional blow; maybe she was dealing with her feelings for James; maybe, again, she felt he deserved it.\u00a0</p><p>Like I said, I\u2019m not sure how I feel about Lily in terms of like, her own motivations and stuff.

                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>2/2 One last thing, wasn&rsquo;t Snape excusing the violence that his friend group was comitting against Muggleborns? (Again I&rsquo;m going off memory, it&rsquo;s been a while). If I was Lily, I certainly would be distancing myself from someone like that. I&rsquo;m not particularly pro or anti Snape, hes an excellent character, and what we see is a very slanted view of things. I always took the scene of Lily rejecting his apology as a culmination of bad things and she&rsquo;d reached her breaking point but that&rsquo;s my opinion\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Yeah, I mean&hellip;</p><p>I absolutely don&rsquo;t blame Lily for cutting Severus out of her life after that incident. Especially given that like, Severus was the one to really formalise the concept of magic in Lily&rsquo;s mind, and how he&rsquo;d been her first real friend, to hear him turn around and use a word like that would have been deeply hurtful, and more than just being a sign of his growing extremism, but like&hellip; That he was willing to break <b>her</b>&nbsp;trust specifically, that whatever these guys were offering him, it was more important than their friendship, than Lily as a person.</p><p>We can look at Severus&rsquo; issues with agency and his decision to become closer with the Death Eaters and ultimately to join them, and we can look at him as a victim of abuse, and his isolation, but firstly, I doubt that Lily was at all that cognizant of the extent of his abuse at home. Sure, she knew he didn&rsquo;t like his parents and that he didn&rsquo;t want to go home, but Lily was a middle-class, relatively sheltered teenage girl, not a child support officer, or a social worker. Given that Severus probably never shared anything about his home life if he didn&rsquo;t absolutely have to, <i>with anybody</i>, I would actually doubt that she&rsquo;d know his home life was abusive at all, or at least not to the extent that it was - I feel that she probably just knew his parents weren&rsquo;t the best, and that he was very poor.&nbsp;</p><p>How is she supposed to know what exactly informs Severus&rsquo; low self esteem? How is she supposed to know that he won&rsquo;t reach out for help? How is she supposed to reconcile his bigotry with their friendship, when he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be trying to do the same thing, when <i>he</i>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t the Muggleborn here?&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I think a lot of the time when we talk about Severus&rsquo; isolation, we just think, oh, well, Lily was his only friend, but the thing is, like&hellip; That&rsquo;s not Lily&rsquo;s fault. By no means at all can anybody blame <i>Lily</i>&nbsp;for the fact that no one else wanted to reach out to Severus and show him the same kindness, that no one was patient with him in the same way. (That we know of. Staff absolutely should have done more, but it could well have been that other students showed him kindness and that they stopped when he retorted or was very brittle in response, as many people with his kind of issues with self worth and intimacy are.)</p><p>And I think that like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t say this to diminish their friendship, and I certainly don&rsquo;t believe that this is how Lily saw this dynamic, but everybody always describes Lily&rsquo;s predilection for extreme kindness, Severus included, in such a way that her engagement with Severus is almost implied to be a charity on her part.
