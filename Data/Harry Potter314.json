It was a girl; she had the Weasley Red Hair &amp; the reader&rsquo;s E/C.</b></h2><p>E/C- Eye Colour</p><p>D/N- Daughter&rsquo;s name</p><p>F/C- Favourite Colour</p><p>*     *     *</p><p>You walked into the kitchen, D/N on your hip. You waved your wand, commanding the cutlery to go to the table as you placed your daughter into her high chair. She cooed and you smiled at her before you waved your wand, bringing food from the fridge. You sat down in front of your daughter and grabbed onto a small jar of baby food that had floated towards you. It was Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal. &lsquo;Hmm tasty&rsquo; You commented. You popped open the spoon as your daughter looked on eagerly. You picked up a spoon and dipped it into the jar, getting out a little bit of oatmeal. </p><p>'Open wide!&rsquo; You said sweetly. She opened her little mouth and you fed her the Oatmeal. She enjoyed it as she let out a little gurgle. You continued to feed her while checking on the breakfast for you and George. You chose to make pancakes for yourself and bacon with eggs for George. D/N giggled and you fed her some more Oatmeal. 'Good girl!&rsquo; You praised as she ate her Oatmeal well. You fed her around half of her breakfast, leaving the rest for the next morning. She babbled away as you made yours and George&rsquo;s breakfast. </p><p>'Morning!&rsquo; You heard George say. You smiled widely. 'Morning love&rsquo; You replied, turning to look at him. He came over to you and pecked your lips before placing a kiss on D/N&rsquo;s cheek. She squealed in response and you giggled. George sat down in the seat you were just occupying. 'She ate all her breakfast!&rsquo; You informed your husband. 'You did. Well done love!&rsquo; George exclaimed. Your daughter giggled, seeming to understand the praise she was getting. You served the eggs and bacon to George before getting your pancakes. </p><p>You sat down next to your daughter. 'What do you want to do today, love?&rsquo; George asked as he tucked into his breakfast. 'How about we go see your mum and dad?&rsquo; You suggested. You hadn&rsquo;t seen Molly and Arthur for a couple of weeks. 'They&rsquo;ll want to see D/N&rsquo; You said. George nodded. 'It&rsquo;ll be good to see Mum and Dad&rsquo; George said. You nodded with a smile. Your daughter was intently watching you eat your pancakes which made you giggle. You broke off a tiny piece and handed it to her. </p><p>You and George watched her as she stared at the piece of pancake before placing it into her mouth. 'Is that good?&rsquo; You asked. She made a sort humming sound and you took that as a yes. You finished your pancakes and waved your wand, cleaning your plate away. 'I&rsquo;ll get her bathed and dressed, okay?&rsquo; You said. George nodded and you pecked his cheek. You picked D/N up and carried her upstairs. </p><p>You had gotten dressed while George held her. Your outfit consisted of a jumper in your f/c, light denim skinny jeans, black f/c ankles boots with a buckle strap. Your hair was put up in a high ponytail and your makeup was light; bb cream, concealer, mascara and a tinted lip balm. For jewellery; f/c stud earrings and a small silver infinity necklace. </p><p>You bathed D/N and picked out a white and pink floral button up baby grow. You placed a clean nappy in her and changed her into the baby grow. You placed her into her cot so you could pack her baby bag along with your bag. You preferred to not use your wand when packing the baby bag so you didn&rsquo;t forget anything. D/N gurgled and cooed in her cot which made you smile. You packed your bag then packed the baby bag, checking it over at least three times before you were satisfied.</p><p>George took a quick shower and changed. He wore a navy blue shirt, denim jeans and navy blue converse. 'You ready love?&rsquo; He asked. You nodded before picking up your daughter. She cooed. 'Guess where we&rsquo;re going?&rsquo; You said. She babbled. 'We&rsquo;re going to see Grandma and Grandpa!&rsquo; You exclaimed. She squealed and giggled. You smiled before looking up at George who was already looking at you with a wide smile on his face. 'What?&rsquo; You questioned. He shook his head. 'Just that you&rsquo;re a brilliant mother!&rsquo; He said. You blushed and pecked his lips. 'And you&rsquo;re an amazing father&rsquo; You replied. You pecked his lips again. 'Freddie would be proud of you&rsquo; You said softly. He nodded sadly and pecked your forehead. It had been a hard 6 years especially for George.</p><p>He grabbed the baby bag and you walked downstairs, leaving out of the front door. You lived in a house nearby so you walked to the Burrow. George opened the door. 'Mum?&rsquo; He called. She came out of the kitchen and immediately smiled upon seeing us. Your daughter let out an excited squee and Molly smiled. She hugged George then you and your daughter. 'Come here sweetheart!&rsquo; She said to D/N. You carefully handed her over. </p><p>'Are you hungry, dears?&rsquo; Molly asked. You shook your head. 'We just ate&rsquo; George replied. Molly nodded and you all sat down in the kitchen. Molly waved her wand and the kettle started boiling, three mugs floated over the the counter. 'Any plans for the rest of the day?&rsquo; Molly asked, bouncing her granddaughter up and down on in her lap. 'Not really. We just thought we&rsquo;d pay a visit&rsquo; George said. 'Haven&rsquo;t seen you a few weeks!&rsquo; Molly nodded with a smile. She handed D/N to George while she made the tea. You asked where Arthur was and Molly said he was at work so he wouldn&rsquo;t be back until later which was a shame. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * Skip to Lunch*</p><p>Molly made you some sandwiches for lunch. She has brought over a wooden high chair that she used to use. You pulled out a jar of baby food; it was chicken and vegetable. It sounded good but it didn&rsquo;t look great. You opened up the jar and Molly handed you a spoon. You fed your daughter and she seemed to enjoy it which was good. 'How is she doing?&rsquo; Molly asked. 'She&rsquo;s been fine. She&rsquo;s sleeping through the night&rsquo; You said. That was good for both you and George. 'She&rsquo;s slightly fussy when it comes to food&rsquo; You said. 'I&rsquo;ve managed to find a couple foods that she seems to enjoy&rsquo; Molly nodded. 'Ginny was like that and Percy&rsquo; She said. 'Ron are anything you gave him&rsquo; You giggled. Every time you saw him, he was eating something. You shook your head in amusement at the thought. </p><p>You again fed D/N half the jar. You were glad that she liked it and wasn&rsquo;t being fussy about it. 'Had she started talking?&rsquo; Molly asked, cleaning up the plates. 'She babbles a lot and cooes so she&rsquo;s trying to!&rsquo; You said as you smiled at your daughter. 'Fff&rsquo; She suddenly said. 'That&rsquo;s good sweetheart&rsquo; You encouraged. You pecked her cheek. 'Feee&rsquo; She said. It was sort of clear. You were wondering what she was trying to say. 'Fr!&rsquo; She exclaimed. George was looking at her curiously. 'What are you trying to say, love?&rsquo; He questioned. You heard her say the F and R quite clearly. You noticed that she was looking at something so you turned your head to see a medium sized frame hanging on the wall. It had a picture on George with his twin brother Fred on it. </p><p>Your eyes widened in response. Was she trying to say 'Fred&rsquo;? You had told her about Fred lots of time and George did too, telling her about their pranks and about their joke shop. You turned back to your daughter. 'Come on sweetheart. You can say it!&rsquo; You encouraged. You really hoped she was saying it. 'Fr&hellip;e&rsquo; She said. &rsquo;d&rsquo; Your eyes widened and you turned to look at George. His eyes were also wide and suddenly became glassy. 'Fred&rsquo; D/N said clearly. There was a loud smash and you turned; Molly had dropped a plate she was holding. Her eyes were now teary and yours were becoming teary as well. 'Fred!&rsquo; She said loudly. You smiled; it was a watery smile but a smile. George suddenly sweeped her into his arms and spun her around. 'Yes love!&rsquo; He said. 'Fred!&rsquo; George pecked her cheek multiple times and praised. </p><p>Fred would be so happy and proud right now. You wiped your tears and joined George, kissing your daughter&rsquo;s cheek. George wrapped his arms around you and pecked your lips. You then walked over to Molly who was still teary eyed. 'You told her about Fred?&rsquo; She asked. You nodded. 'Of course!&rsquo; You replied. 'She deserves to know who he is. He may be gone but he&rsquo;s still family&rsquo; Molly smiled a watery smile and she pulled you into a hug. 'Thank you&rsquo; She said. You nodded then Molly went over to George and her granddaughter, smiling. She praised D/N and you couldn&rsquo;t but smile. </p><p>Your daughter just said her first word which was 'Fred&rsquo;. It meant a lot to all of you and it made you proud. Freddie would&rsquo;ve been an fantastic uncle and you know that he&rsquo;s looking down on your family. You smiled before going over to them. George wrapped on arm around your waist as you watched your daughter giggle at her grandma. 'You alright, Georgie?&rsquo; You asked. He nodded and you laid your head on his chest as he wrapped his other arm around your waist. You leaned up and kissed his lips. You stayed like that for awhile, enjoying the moment.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * </p><p>Again another repost but I hope you liked rereading or if you&rsquo;re new, I really hope you liked it.

It was a girl; she had the Weasley Red Hair &amp; the reader\u2019s E/C.</b></h2><p>E/C- Eye Colour</p><p>D/N- Daughter\u2019s name</p><p>F/C- Favourite Colour</p><p>*     *     *</p><p>You walked into the kitchen, D/N on your hip. You waved your wand, commanding the cutlery to go to the table as you placed your daughter into her high chair. She cooed and you smiled at her before you waved your wand, bringing food from the fridge. You sat down in front of your daughter and grabbed onto a small jar of baby food that had floated towards you. It was Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal. \u2018Hmm tasty\u2019 You commented. You popped open the spoon as your daughter looked on eagerly. You picked up a spoon and dipped it into the jar, getting out a little bit of oatmeal. </p><p>'Open wide!\u2019 You said sweetly. She opened her little mouth and you fed her the Oatmeal. She enjoyed it as she let out a little gurgle. You continued to feed her while checking on the breakfast for you and George. You chose to make pancakes for yourself and bacon with eggs for George. D/N giggled and you fed her some more Oatmeal. 'Good girl!\u2019 You praised as she ate her Oatmeal well. You fed her around half of her breakfast, leaving the rest for the next morning. She babbled away as you made yours and George\u2019s breakfast. </p><p>'Morning!\u2019 You heard George say. You smiled widely. 'Morning love\u2019 You replied, turning to look at him. He came over to you and pecked your lips before placing a kiss on D/N\u2019s cheek. She squealed in response and you giggled. George sat down in the seat you were just occupying. 'She ate all her breakfast!\u2019 You informed your husband. 'You did. Well done love!\u2019 George exclaimed. Your daughter giggled, seeming to understand the praise she was getting. You served the eggs and bacon to George before getting your pancakes. </p><p>You sat down next to your daughter. 'What do you want to do today, love?\u2019 George asked as he tucked into his breakfast. 'How about we go see your mum and dad?\u2019 You suggested. You hadn\u2019t seen Molly and Arthur for a couple of weeks. 'They\u2019ll want to see D/N\u2019 You said. George nodded. 'It\u2019ll be good to see Mum and Dad\u2019 George said. You nodded with a smile. Your daughter was intently watching you eat your pancakes which made you giggle. You broke off a tiny piece and handed it to her. </p><p>You and George watched her as she stared at the piece of pancake before placing it into her mouth. 'Is that good?\u2019 You asked. She made a sort humming sound and you took that as a yes. You finished your pancakes and waved your wand, cleaning your plate away. 'I\u2019ll get her bathed and dressed, okay?\u2019 You said. George nodded and you pecked his cheek. You picked D/N up and carried her upstairs. </p><p>You had gotten dressed while George held her. Your outfit consisted of a jumper in your f/c, light denim skinny jeans, black f/c ankles boots with a buckle strap. Your hair was put up in a high ponytail and your makeup was light; bb cream, concealer, mascara and a tinted lip balm. For jewellery; f/c stud earrings and a small silver infinity necklace. </p><p>You bathed D/N and picked out a white and pink floral button up baby grow. You placed a clean nappy in her and changed her into the baby grow. You placed her into her cot so you could pack her baby bag along with your bag. You preferred to not use your wand when packing the baby bag so you didn\u2019t forget anything. D/N gurgled and cooed in her cot which made you smile. You packed your bag then packed the baby bag, checking it over at least three times before you were satisfied.</p><p>George took a quick shower and changed. He wore a navy blue shirt, denim jeans and navy blue converse. 'You ready love?\u2019 He asked. You nodded before picking up your daughter. She cooed. 'Guess where we\u2019re going?\u2019 You said. She babbled. 'We\u2019re going to see Grandma and Grandpa!\u2019 You exclaimed. She squealed and giggled. You smiled before looking up at George who was already looking at you with a wide smile on his face. 'What?\u2019 You questioned. He shook his head. 'Just that you\u2019re a brilliant mother!\u2019 He said. You blushed and pecked his lips. 'And you\u2019re an amazing father\u2019 You replied. You pecked his lips again. 'Freddie would be proud of you\u2019 You said softly. He nodded sadly and pecked your forehead. It had been a hard 6 years especially for George.</p><p>He grabbed the baby bag and you walked downstairs, leaving out of the front door. You lived in a house nearby so you walked to the Burrow. George opened the door. 'Mum?\u2019 He called. She came out of the kitchen and immediately smiled upon seeing us. Your daughter let out an excited squee and Molly smiled. She hugged George then you and your daughter. 'Come here sweetheart!\u2019 She said to D/N. You carefully handed her over. </p><p>'Are you hungry, dears?\u2019 Molly asked. You shook your head. 'We just ate\u2019 George replied. Molly nodded and you all sat down in the kitchen. Molly waved her wand and the kettle started boiling, three mugs floated over the the counter. 'Any plans for the rest of the day?\u2019 Molly asked, bouncing her granddaughter up and down on in her lap. 'Not really. We just thought we\u2019d pay a visit\u2019 George said. 'Haven\u2019t seen you a few weeks!\u2019 Molly nodded with a smile. She handed D/N to George while she made the tea. You asked where Arthur was and Molly said he was at work so he wouldn\u2019t be back until later which was a shame. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * Skip to Lunch*</p><p>Molly made you some sandwiches for lunch. She has brought over a wooden high chair that she used to use. You pulled out a jar of baby food; it was chicken and vegetable. It sounded good but it didn\u2019t look great. You opened up the jar and Molly handed you a spoon. You fed your daughter and she seemed to enjoy it which was good. 'How is she doing?\u2019 Molly asked. 'She\u2019s been fine. She\u2019s sleeping through the night\u2019 You said. That was good for both you and George. 'She\u2019s slightly fussy when it comes to food\u2019 You said. 'I\u2019ve managed to find a couple foods that she seems to enjoy\u2019 Molly nodded. 'Ginny was like that and Percy\u2019 She said. 'Ron are anything you gave him\u2019 You giggled. Every time you saw him, he was eating something. You shook your head in amusement at the thought. </p><p>You again fed D/N half the jar. You were glad that she liked it and wasn\u2019t being fussy about it. 'Had she started talking?\u2019 Molly asked, cleaning up the plates. 'She babbles a lot and cooes so she\u2019s trying to!\u2019 You said as you smiled at your daughter. 'Fff\u2019 She suddenly said. 'That\u2019s good sweetheart\u2019 You encouraged. You pecked her cheek. 'Feee\u2019 She said. It was sort of clear. You were wondering what she was trying to say. 'Fr!\u2019 She exclaimed. George was looking at her curiously. 'What are you trying to say, love?\u2019 He questioned. You heard her say the F and R quite clearly. You noticed that she was looking at something so you turned your head to see a medium sized frame hanging on the wall. It had a picture on George with his twin brother Fred on it. </p><p>Your eyes widened in response. Was she trying to say 'Fred\u2019? You had told her about Fred lots of time and George did too, telling her about their pranks and about their joke shop. You turned back to your daughter. 'Come on sweetheart. You can say it!\u2019 You encouraged. You really hoped she was saying it. 'Fr\u2026e\u2019 She said. \u2019d\u2019 Your eyes widened and you turned to look at George. His eyes were also wide and suddenly became glassy. 'Fred\u2019 D/N said clearly. There was a loud smash and you turned; Molly had dropped a plate she was holding. Her eyes were now teary and yours were becoming teary as well. 'Fred!\u2019 She said loudly. You smiled; it was a watery smile but a smile. George suddenly sweeped her into his arms and spun her around. 'Yes love!\u2019 He said. 'Fred!\u2019 George pecked her cheek multiple times and praised. </p><p>Fred would be so happy and proud right now. You wiped your tears and joined George, kissing your daughter\u2019s cheek. George wrapped his arms around you and pecked your lips. You then walked over to Molly who was still teary eyed. 'You told her about Fred?\u2019 She asked. You nodded. 'Of course!\u2019 You replied. 'She deserves to know who he is. He may be gone but he\u2019s still family\u2019 Molly smiled a watery smile and she pulled you into a hug. 'Thank you\u2019 She said. You nodded then Molly went over to George and her granddaughter, smiling. She praised D/N and you couldn\u2019t but smile. </p><p>Your daughter just said her first word which was 'Fred\u2019. It meant a lot to all of you and it made you proud. Freddie would\u2019ve been an fantastic uncle and you know that he\u2019s looking down on your family. You smiled before going over to them. George wrapped on arm around your waist as you watched your daughter giggle at her grandma. 'You alright, Georgie?\u2019 You asked. He nodded and you laid your head on his chest as he wrapped his other arm around your waist. You leaned up and kissed his lips. You stayed like that for awhile, enjoying the moment.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * </p><p>Again another repost but I hope you liked rereading or if you\u2019re new, I really hope you liked it.
