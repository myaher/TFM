The crimson fabric felt cool and different against your skin.</p><p>You were one of the slaves she freed, the most beautiful woman among them. There were even legends about your beauty heard in all Westeros, you affected men and women so deeply. So that was no surprise to you that the slaves chose you when the queen, the breaker of chains, the mother of dragons, asked for a hand in marriage to seal her vow of respect to her people. She wished to marry a person who everyone knew well and trusted to make them feel safe like at home. The person chosen by the gathering was you, they wanted to give their queen the best they had. You prepared by many old, experienced women how to behave on the wedding night and they all advised you to be submissive to her, she was your khaleesi, you were her gift.</p><p>You lied unclothed across the bed, your hair splayed on the pillows, waiting for Daenerys to return from your wedding feast. You&rsquo;ve never expected to have such an extravagant wedding, so the whole situation overwhelmed you a bit. You were a virgin, a virgin very insecure about her body, despite everyone telling you how perfect you were. They never saw you naked. What if the queen won&rsquo;t like you? Or she will prefer men?</p><p>A loud squeak of the wooden door interrupted your thoughts as Daenerys entered the bedchamber in her full glory, her hair let down and a blush adoring her pale cheeks.</p><p>- Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; You could&rsquo;ve waited for me, you know - she blushed even harder shyly peeking at your body - You&rsquo;re beautiful, more beautiful than any tale people tell.</p><p>- Thank you, your grace, you are very kind to me - you sat up, waiting for her to make a move, but she stood still.</p><p>- Don&rsquo;t call me &ldquo;your grace&rdquo;, Y/N, call me Daenerys or Dany or any pet name you like. I am your wife now, aren&rsquo;t I? - she smiled warmly, finally starting to unlace her dress.</p><p>- Have you ever made love with a woman, darling? - she asked climbing onto the bed in her underwear, all of her slight curves, her hipbones and breasts driving your imagination crazy.</p><p>- No, I have not - you sighed, you wanted to reach out and touch her, but you weren&rsquo;t supposed to. You were supposed to lie down and let her take you however you like, so you did.</p><p>- What are you doing? - she giggled at your submissive position - If you don&rsquo;t want to do anything, I can bring you my sleeping gown and we can cuddle.</p><p>- I want to, but the slave women said I shall be obedient to you and do anything you say - you stammered nervously as she sat on your thighs, her skin making contact with yours getting you more and more aroused.</p><p>- I was in the same place as you are a couple of years ago. Drogo treated me very unpleasantly on our first night and I promised myself to always be the most gentle and loving wife during the wedding night. But I think there shouldn&rsquo;t be any &ldquo;submissive&rdquo; and &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; labels if you don&rsquo;t like it. I want you to feel good and comfortable, my love. I&rsquo;m not your enemy, I won&rsquo;t hurt you, you know I respect you and love you, I would never treat you wrong - she took your hand in hers, massaging it gently before planting a kiss on it - Now, relax, let me take the lead and don&rsquo;t hold back any noises.</p><p>She lied on top of you after taking off her underwear. Your naked bodies felt magical against each other as you drowned in the passionate, long kiss. Daenerys licked your upper lip teasingly earning a soft whimper in response and gaining the entrance to your mouth. Your tongues danced together painfully slowly. She tasted like fine wine and strawberries with cream, you couldn&rsquo;t get enough of that ambrose. Your hands started to touch her hips very lightly, gasping at the softness of her skin, slowly moving to her waist and ribs, than down to the curve of her bottom. You squeezed softly as she bit your bottom lip, Daenerys moaning into the kiss. It was like the sweetest melody you have ever heard, like the addicting voice of mermaids luring the sailors, you would do anything to hear her moan again.</p><p>- Do you want me to use my fingers or my tongue first, my beautiful? - she breathed out, placing an open mouthed kiss behind your ear.</p><p>- Your tongue, Dany, oh gods - you whined as she kissed passionately from your neck to your bosom.</p><p>She pressed affectionate kisses to every inch of your skin before she took one nipple between her lips, sucking boldly. Despite all her royal aura, she seemed to be very unsure what she&rsquo;s doing and with your every tiny moan her eyes lit up proudly.</p><p>- You&rsquo;re so gorgeous - she groaned, leaving a small path of hickeys on your lower stomach.</p><p>- Dany, please, I need you - you moaned out, tangling your fingers in her silky hair, tugging softly as she placed delicate kisses on your outer lips.</p><p>- You need me to do what, my love? - she smiled innocently, spreading your lips slowly.</p><p>- To eat me - you lifted your legs on her shoulders, forcing her to dive into you.</p><p>You always imagined sex as something painful and satisfactory only for men, but when you felt her gentle licks, the firm sucking, her tongue sliding in and out of you, little nips and the impossible patterns she drew on you it felt like heaven, she was your goddess. Daenerys looked up at you, the volume and frequency of your moans telling her you were close to your very first orgasm. Suddenly, you felt her finger entering you hesitantly and carefully not to hurt you.</p><p>- Deeper, Dany, I&hellip; - you gripped her hair in pure bliss, feeling her digit curl inside you, stroking your walls. Soon enough you contracted atround her, Dany quickly pressing her open mouth to you, ready to take every single drop of your juices. She looked like an angel when she rose from under you, her lips and chin wet from your fluids.</p><p>- You want to kiss me? - she lied down and motioned for you to climb her. You eagerly pressed your lips to her, tasting your sweetness on her tongue. She opened her arms for you to cuddle into her.</p><p>- Am I not supposed to please you, khaleesi? - you yawned, placing a loving kiss on her pale collarbone.</p><p>- You must be exhausted, my sun and stars, now we will rest. We will finish in the morning or whenever you wish.</p><p>- Oh, Dany - you sighed - It was wonderful, thank you.</p><p>- Don&rsquo;t thank me, it was my pleasure.</p>",

You were a virgin, a virgin very insecure about her body, despite everyone telling you how perfect you were. They never saw you naked. What if the queen won\u2019t like you? Or she will prefer men?</p><p>A loud squeak of the wooden door interrupted your thoughts as Daenerys entered the bedchamber in her full glory, her hair let down and a blush adoring her pale cheeks.</p><p>- Oh, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 You could\u2019ve waited for me, you know - she blushed even harder shyly peeking at your body - You\u2019re beautiful, more beautiful than any tale people tell.</p><p>- Thank you, your grace, you are very kind to me - you sat up, waiting for her to make a move, but she stood still.</p><p>- Don\u2019t call me \u201cyour grace\u201d, Y/N, call me Daenerys or Dany or any pet name you like. I am your wife now, aren\u2019t I? - she smiled warmly, finally starting to unlace her dress.</p><p>- Have you ever made love with a woman, darling? - she asked climbing onto the bed in her underwear, all of her slight curves, her hipbones and breasts driving your imagination crazy.</p><p>- No, I have not - you sighed, you wanted to reach out and touch her, but you weren\u2019t supposed to. You were supposed to lie down and let her take you however you like, so you did.</p><p>- What are you doing? - she giggled at your submissive position - If you don\u2019t want to do anything, I can bring you my sleeping gown and we can cuddle.</p><p>- I want to, but the slave women said I shall be obedient to you and do anything you say - you stammered nervously as she sat on your thighs, her skin making contact with yours getting you more and more aroused.</p><p>- I was in the same place as you are a couple of years ago. Drogo treated me very unpleasantly on our first night and I promised myself to always be the most gentle and loving wife during the wedding night. But I think there shouldn\u2019t be any \u201csubmissive\u201d and \u201cdominant\u201d labels if you don\u2019t like it. I want you to feel good and comfortable, my love. I\u2019m not your enemy, I won\u2019t hurt you, you know I respect you and love you, I would never treat you wrong - she took your hand in hers, massaging it gently before planting a kiss on it - Now, relax, let me take the lead and don\u2019t hold back any noises.</p><p>She lied on top of you after taking off her underwear. Your naked bodies felt magical against each other as you drowned in the passionate, long kiss. Daenerys licked your upper lip teasingly earning a soft whimper in response and gaining the entrance to your mouth. Your tongues danced together painfully slowly. She tasted like fine wine and strawberries with cream, you couldn\u2019t get enough of that ambrose. Your hands started to touch her hips very lightly, gasping at the softness of her skin, slowly moving to her waist and ribs, than down to the curve of her bottom. You squeezed softly as she bit your bottom lip, Daenerys moaning into the kiss. It was like the sweetest melody you have ever heard, like the addicting voice of mermaids luring the sailors, you would do anything to hear her moan again.</p><p>- Do you want me to use my fingers or my tongue first, my beautiful? - she breathed out, placing an open mouthed kiss behind your ear.</p><p>- Your tongue, Dany, oh gods - you whined as she kissed passionately from your neck to your bosom.</p><p>She pressed affectionate kisses to every inch of your skin before she took one nipple between her lips, sucking boldly. Despite all her royal aura, she seemed to be very unsure what she\u2019s doing and with your every tiny moan her eyes lit up proudly.</p><p>- You\u2019re so gorgeous - she groaned, leaving a small path of hickeys on your lower stomach.</p><p>- Dany, please, I need you - you moaned out, tangling your fingers in her silky hair, tugging softly as she placed delicate kisses on your outer lips.</p><p>- You need me to do what, my love? - she smiled innocently, spreading your lips slowly.</p><p>- To eat me - you lifted your legs on her shoulders, forcing her to dive into you.</p><p>You always imagined sex as something painful and satisfactory only for men, but when you felt her gentle licks, the firm sucking, her tongue sliding in and out of you, little nips and the impossible patterns she drew on you it felt like heaven, she was your goddess. Daenerys looked up at you, the volume and frequency of your moans telling her you were close to your very first orgasm. Suddenly, you felt her finger entering you hesitantly and carefully not to hurt you.</p><p>- Deeper, Dany, I\u2026 - you gripped her hair in pure bliss, feeling her digit curl inside you, stroking your walls. Soon enough you contracted atround her, Dany quickly pressing her open mouth to you, ready to take every single drop of your juices. She looked like an angel when she rose from under you, her lips and chin wet from your fluids.</p><p>- You want to kiss me? - she lied down and motioned for you to climb her. You eagerly pressed your lips to her, tasting your sweetness on her tongue. She opened her arms for you to cuddle into her.</p><p>- Am I not supposed to please you, khaleesi? - you yawned, placing a loving kiss on her pale collarbone.</p><p>- You must be exhausted, my sun and stars, now we will rest. We will finish in the morning or whenever you wish.</p><p>- Oh, Dany - you sighed - It was wonderful, thank you.</p><p>- Don\u2019t thank me, it was my pleasure.</p></p>",
