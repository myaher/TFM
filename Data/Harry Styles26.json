Either way I hope it\u2019s what you wanted, all my love! </b></i></p><p>If there was ever a moment you\u2019d want to scream at the top of your lungs to just really let your bastard emotions be known - it would be right now. Your ears are hot and ringing, throat tight as you attempt to swallow it down with a bite of your food. You can feel the back of your neck prickling with heat as your anger and hurt begins to rise in your chest, eyes wide yet brows furrowed as you stare at your boyfriend in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You spit, throat coated with a mixture of your anger and the mouthful of curry you just about managed to swallow. The word is tight on delivery, cracking in every possible place, and you feel the need to swallow again.</p><p>\u201cI said it doesn\u2019t taste right.\u201d Harry repeats himself, staring at you in bewilderment since your entire demeanour had changed with the flick of a switch about five seconds ago.</p><p>\u201cNo, I heard you, Harry.\u201d You mutter through gritted teeth, setting your cutlery down before you maybe do something stupid with it. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018it doesn\u2019t taste right\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Harry stares from you to his bowl and back, swallowing the lump in his own throat before he answers. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s the chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s fucking Quorn, Harry.\u201d You remind him, leaning back in your chair and folding your arms across your chest. \u201cThink I\u2019m just gonna force you to eat actual chicken when you\u2019ve started this fucking vegetarian diet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a bit odd, love. That\u2019s all\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake your own fucking dinner in future then.\u201d You grumble, abruptly standing from your seat at the table and taking your curry with you.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you getting so snippy about it? I only made a bloody comment, love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took me fucking ages to make this shit!\u201d You screech, because you really had had to start prepping it early this morning if you were going to do the recipe properly. \u201cI never said anything when you wanted to start this diet, I just went with it. And I\u2019m trying to make it easy for you but apparently you\u2019re going to be a prick about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, for crying out loud.\u201d Harry says with a roll of his eyes, which absolutely does not help the near rage in the pit of your belly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any harm by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too fucking late, Harry. Harm done.\u201d</p><p>He watches you as you leave with your food in hand, completely baffled by your outburst. It\u2019s not like you to get so easily wound up by something, especially not something he said. He\u2019s irritated actually - that you\u2019ve been away from each other for a while and today is his first day home, and you\u2019re already kicking off with him about something. So much for having a nice week or so to yourselves.</p><p>~</p><p>When Harry wakes the next morning you\u2019re not in bed beside him. For the remainder of last night you were absent, ignoring him until it was time for bed, and even then you kept yourself on the very edge of the bed.</p><p>He sits up and stretches, his nose greeted with smell of sausages and bacon, his mouth instantly watering. Until he remembers he can\u2019t eat that anymore and he feels a bit put out. Were you doing it on purpose?</p><p>Yes you were.</p><p>When Harry enters the kitchen you\u2019re just sitting at the dining table basically a near fry-up in front of you, not even sparing him a single glance as you begin to tuck in.</p><p>\u201cIs there\u2026 anything for me?\u201d He asks awkwardly, flicking the kettle on to boil. He knows it\u2019s a dangerous question, in fact it was tight in his chest as he asked, but he felt the need to nonetheless, just to weigh how much shit he really was in.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you can find to make yourself.\u201d You tell him flatly between mouthfuls, still refusing to look at him.</p><p>Harry feels his heart deflate a little at your reply, not really expecting you to be so cold after a small argument over something like dinner. So he just goes with it for now, knowing you\u2019ll get over it sooner or later.</p><p>~</p><p>Harry\u2019s a little nervous. He\u2019s sitting at the table waiting for you to come back from your sister\u2019s house, alternating between chewing on his lip and biting his nails.</p><p>So he fucked up earlier in the week - he gets that now. There were a hundred other ways he could have approached the situation rather than just \u2018this tastes shit\u2019, but he\u2019s an idiot at times; his mouth rules his head.</p><p>All week you\u2019ve been ignoring him - in fact you\u2019ve barely uttered a word to him besides the usual \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019. It\u2019s eating him up. Because he knows that you\u2019re feeling neglected, especially when he\u2019s barely home at the moment. He\u2019s just come back from being away for months and the first thing he did was insult you.</p><p>So yeah - he\u2019s feeling a little guilty.</p><p>He flinches at the sound of the door opening, rising from his seat to greet you in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He mumbles, standing under the kitchen doorframe and fiddling with his rings.</p><p>You glance his way as you take your shoes off, kicking them onto the rack and shrugging out of your coat. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you um, have a nice time at your sister\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>You nod limply but offer nothing more as you head for the stairs. You\u2019re caught a little of guard when Harry reaches for your wrist, and you frown up at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWait, um,\u201d he stutters, pulling you towards him gently, \u201cI need to apologise. For the other day.\u201d</p><p>You sigh and angle yourself right in front of him. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m too tired to talk about th-,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d He begs, lightly caressing your cheek with the backs of his fingers, \u201cjust come with me a sec?\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take you long to give in, because you can see the sincerity in his eyes, and the pleading. So you nod and allow him to pull you into the kitchen.</p><p>You\u2019re not expecting what you see - the room completely dark besides the ensemble of tea lights in the middle of the dining room table, two glasses of wine above two place settings, even with the cloth napkins you only use for special occasions.</p><p>\u201cW-what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Harry releases a long and drawn out breath from beside you, before pulling you into his chest with a tight embrace. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. Was a right dick the other day, don\u2019t even know why.\u201d</p><p>You heave a mirrored breath into his chest, wrapping your arms around his middle while he peppers kisses into your loose hair.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t even that bad, I swear.\u201d He laughs a single, bitter hum, which you have to join in with. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why I said anything and I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d Your voice is muffled by his chest, but he still catches your comment and chuckles.</p><p>Harry rests his finger under your chin and brings your head up to look into your eyes. \u201cI\u2019m a twat, but I\u2019m a twat that loves you. And I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019sorry for getting so stroppy about it.\u201d You mumble, but he shakes his head at you.</p><p>He leans down to press a soft kiss to your lips. \u201cNope, this is all on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, might\u2019ve overreacted\u2026\u201d</p><p>His brilliant smile pulls his lips upwards, his fingers grazing your cheek again. \u201cNot gonna agree because it\u2019ll only end up worse for me again.\u201d</p><p>You let out a giggle and nod up at him, holding yourself tighter to him. \u201cProbably a smart decision.\u201d You agree, reaching up to kiss him again, before freeing yourself from him to look at the laid table. \u201cSo, whats for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckles as he moves around you and pulls a chair out for you. \u201cNot curry with Quorn pieces - that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Thiiiiis could be rubbish\u2026</p><p>Tag list: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRQvNGuL791trMASjjacTyQ\">@pxrrishly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m73AsCPI6pl5ydzYNqZA7ig\">@staceystoleyourheart</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@harrystyles-concepts</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZRip2ZNdgboKd6U6cXPvGA\">@flowerrrrrchilddd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgrGBah2yj4TnFyzYRijzTQ\">@belle-ofthe-sea</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbryUSDk8hHw5rIDbYFA7aQ\">@grace-leigh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD79q662XJ4yMKN7-cXEIJQ\">@winchesterwife27</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgQ5EdNPkpDmT4rcK7Heukg\">@lovableah</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@particularnarry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnkGxxRkCVT61iklFLAskaw\">@secret-lil-rendez-vous</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmeYqReZqws9Lc4nBNu0ERw\">@stylesangelsx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK1QD13efdUXMi2H0exoJqQ\">@thefireisgone</a> </p>",
