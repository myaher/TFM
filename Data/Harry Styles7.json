Tell me what you think about the chapter. - <i>Allie.</i></p><p><b>.</b><br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Kalosirthate stin Ellada!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Danke sch\u00f6n!&rdquo; Harry waved at the doorman who gave him a weird look as he dragged his luggage into the resort lobby. Y/N tugged at his arm, covering her mouth so she wouldn&rsquo;t laugh too hard and draw even more attention to them.</p><p>&ldquo;You just said &rsquo;<i>thank you very much</i>&rsquo; in German, H!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t what he said in German?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He said &rsquo;<i>welcome to Greece</i>&rsquo; in Greek because we&rsquo;re in Greece! Why would a staff in a Greek resort speak German?!&rdquo;</p><!-- more --><p>When seeing how amazed he was, Y/N could&rsquo;t help but chuckle as she interlocked their fingers, flashing him a cheeky grin. &ldquo;I may or may not have done a bit of research.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, my wife&rsquo;s gonna be my little translator on this trip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your wife only knows <i>&lsquo;good morning&rsquo;</i> and <i>'good night&rsquo;</i> so you&rsquo;re not so lucky, Mr. Styles,&rdquo; she said, tip-toeing to peck his lips, but he was quick to lock one arm around her waist to kiss her passionately. That kiss could&rsquo;ve turned into a full make out session if she hadn&rsquo;t come to her senses and pushed him away.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you be horny later when we&rsquo;re alone?&rdquo;</p><p>Her pink cheeks made Harry snort in amusement. He ran his hand up and down her back to rest dangerously close to her bum, which looked extra good in this vintage dress, he must say. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re married. People know we fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We do, just <i>not</i> in the resort lobby after arriving only five minutes ago,&rdquo; she told him, rolling her eyes. </p><p>With his arm wrapped around her, they headed towards the front desk for the check-in procedures and finally received their keys. That moment was by far the happiest they&rsquo;d ever been since their wedding night. After all, they were on their romantic honeymoon, on a beautiful island in Greece, and they were gonna be there for an entire week, just the two of them. It almost seemed like nothing could go wrong.</p><p><i>Almost</i>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Harold?!&rdquo;</i></p><p>When Harry heard that voice he thought he was hallucinating. But as the voice got louder and more annoying, causing all the other guests as well as the staff to stare at him. He knew it was real.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey?&rdquo; His wife mumbled, she was also rooted to her spot. &ldquo;Did you hear that or was it just me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh God&hellip;I heard it too&hellip;&rdquo; He sucked in a breath, turning around slowly as she did the same. Of all the annoying people he&rsquo;d come across in his entire life up to this point, it just <i>had</i> to be his mortal enemy \u2014 <i>his cousin</i> <i>Mason.</i></p><p>Despite Harry&rsquo;s hostile glare, the older Styles was beaming. &ldquo;What a lovely coincidence! Are you two on honeymoon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you here to ruin my life?&rdquo;</p><p>The question made Mason chuckle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still funny, Harold. <i>Still</i> funny. I&rsquo;m actually on a summer vacation with my baby girl. Oh, there she is, my flower!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sweet cheeks! My baby!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna throw up&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N whispered to her husband, receiving a smirk from him.</p><p>Stephanie showed up, wearing the biggest hat that covered half of her face as she strutted towards the three of them in her yellow summer dress. She&rsquo;d left all of her heavy luggage to the poor resort staff, who nearly got hit in the head by her throwing her handbag at him.</p><p>&ldquo;The other Styles!&rdquo; She giggled, finally taking off her hat to pull the other couple into a hug. If Harry hadn&rsquo;t pushed her away, who knew how long she would&rsquo;ve kept squeezing them? &ldquo;We missed your wedding! I think your invitation got lost in the mail!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bold of you to think we sent you one.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N quickly nudged Harry as she chuckled nervously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, Steph&hellip;We also missed your wedding so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to your second ones!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephanie and her husband both fell about laughing at her rude joke. The kind of looks Harry and Y/N exchanged at that moment couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious that they&rsquo;d rather set themselves on fire than continue this dumb conversation. They were just too nice (or at least Y/N was) to say <i>'fuck off&rsquo;</i> and walk away.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to our room now,&rdquo; Y/N said, holding Harry&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Nice talking to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Harry! Bye Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N heard Stephanie loud and clear but she didn&rsquo;t look back and just stride as fast as possible towards the lift.</p><p>&ldquo;See you tonight at the bar, Harold!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, responded to his cousin with a middle finger in the air, and once again Y/N had to tug at his sleeve to tell him to be polite.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a funny kid,&rdquo; Mason told his wife with a grin, before heading to the front desk.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The newlyweds&rsquo; first day on the island wasn&rsquo;t so bad, minus the encounter with the other annoying couple that they hated more than Mondays. They got to spend a lot of time together soaked in the sun and the golden sand, and <i>not</i> thinking about the responsibilities they had back in London. As busy as they were with their own jobs, they rarely had time to have fun like they used to back when they were students. Now was the one chance for them to try everything they hadn&rsquo;t done before.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope nearly fucking your husband on the beach while being drunk off your ass was on your bucket list.&rdquo; Harry laughed as he dragged his wife out of the lift, and struggled to get the room card from his pocket while she was clinging onto him like a koala.</p><p>Normally, he would stop her from drinking too much. He always knew she could barely handle alcohol, but since they were on vacation, he made it an exception and let her do whatever she wanted. As a result, she was wasted and he was exhausted from making sure she didn&rsquo;t cause any trouble. His wife was a fun drunk, but every time she drank too much, it was always hard work for him. He had to make sure she didn&rsquo;t walk straight into a lamppost, get hit by a car for dancing on the street, or take off her clothes in public because she thought they were alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; she mumbled, shoving two fingers in his face as he opened the door. &ldquo;<i>Two</i> days into our marriage&hellip;and you already don&rsquo;t want to have sex with me anymore!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure if you didn&rsquo;t count those two orgasms earlier.&rdquo; Harry laughed quietly. He just loved having silly conversations with her while she was not in her right mind to make any sense. </p><p>With a bit of difficulty, he shut the door after they&rsquo;d got in, and somehow managed to put her down on their bed. That was when Y/N started giggling like a madwoman, watching her husband stand with both hands on his hips and a confused grin on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hubby, come give me a kiss!&rdquo; She tried to open her eyes to look at him, but they were fighting to stay shut, so she just opened her arms and gave him a silly grin. Harry took off her shoes as well as his own, then fell down onto the bed right by her side. He propped himself up on his elbow, pressing his lips to her temple.</p><p>&ldquo;No! A real kiss!&rdquo; Y/N pouted. She didn&rsquo;t wait for his reaction to grab him by the collar of his shirt and kiss him hard on the mouth. Harry was a bit shocked considering how shy Y/N was most of the time. Actually, she&rsquo;d gained much more confidence after that many years they&rsquo;d been together. But shyness was just her nature, and he loved that about her.</p><p>Only when she&rsquo;d had a couple drinks did she get this bold. This was certainly <i>not</i> the first time, but Harry didn&rsquo;t think he could ever grow used to it. Soon he was right between her legs, one hand supporting his own weight as the other held her by the hip. Her black dress rose up to reveal the black lace underwear he&rsquo;d got for her. He intended to make a cheeky comment about it, yet she was already unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, you&rsquo;re <i>really</i> drunk,&rdquo; he whispered against her lips, chuckling lowly as she groaned like a spoiled little girl who didn&rsquo;t get the pony she asked for.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not on the beach anymore,&rdquo; she reasoned, eyebrows furrowed at him and opened his shirt to get her hands on his bare chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ, baby. Greece really does make you horny, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> make me horny.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was taken aback for the second time that night, not only by her confidence but also by her flipping them over to straddle him. He tried to speak, yet she covered his mouth with her own, pressing both hands on his chest, pushing him down.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>She shushed him immediately. Holding his gaze, she moved slowly downward, wasting no time to pull down his shorts and wrapped her hands around his pulsing member. A growl escaped his throat as he shuddered at the feeling of her hot breath against him. When she gave him a slight squeeze, his hips buckled up, urging her to give him more. He was leaking and desperate for her touch, definitely not in the position to call it quit at this point.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you in the palm of my hand,&rdquo; she said in a sing-song voice. <i>&ldquo;Literally.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The sound of her name escaped his pink lips in a breathy tone. When he saw the way her pupils dilate even in the dim moonlight from their balcony door, he knew he was fucked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a good girl.&rdquo; <i>Fuck</i>. &ldquo;Let me suck you off, please?&rdquo; <i>Fuck. Me.</i></p><p>Harry exhaled harshly, too out of his mind to even think straight as he stroked her hair. &ldquo;Y-Yes&hellip;yes, you are&hellip;<i>Fuck</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded, finally giving him a few slow strokes. Harry&rsquo;s eyes squeezed shut in an instant as his entire face contorted. He was afraid this would end so quickly that her forgetting all about tonight might seem like a good thing. Just as he was about to ask her to go faster, a loud <i>thump!</i> caused Y/N to sit up straight, eyes just as wide as his. The bed in the room next door was violently banging against the wall, as the couple over there didn&rsquo;t make an effort to keep it down.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck yeah, baby! Fuck me! Fuck me hard!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck is&hellip;<i>that?</i>&rdquo; A look of terror flashed across Harry&rsquo;s face when he made eye-contact with a giggly Y/N. She had no idea what was going on, but everything was hilarious to her when she was drunk. As much as he wanted to ignore that horny couple to go back to his own business, he couldn&rsquo;t even <i>think</i> with all the noises those people were making. In a second, he sat up and tucked himself back inside his shorts, pecking Y/N&rsquo;s lips as he told her he would go talk to them.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She shook her head, hands on his shoulders. &ldquo;Stay with me, Harry&hellip;I need you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s self-control unraveled when she moaned his name that way. Nodding fast, he attached their mouths once again as she cupped his cheeks and kissed him with everything she&rsquo;d got. He tried to focus on her, he <i>really</i> did, until he heard the name of the <i>last</i> person he wanted to think of when he was about to have sex with his wife.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Mason! Yes, that&rsquo;s right baby!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;No, no, non no!&rdquo; Harry cried out, pulling away immediately. Though Y/N wasn&rsquo;t sober enough to get disgusted by the other two, she still agreed to get off her husband and follow him outside. As he knocked on the room next door, she hugged him from behind and rested her head on his back. Drunk Y/N always got a bit clingy, and Harry loved it actually. If only he could pay attention to her and take care of her instead of having to deal with his fucked up cousin.</p><p>When he knocked a couple more times, it was Stephanie who came to open the door, wearing only her lingerie. Harry had to stare at the ceiling while silently thanking god that the woman wasn&rsquo;t naked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry and Y/N! What a surprise! We were just\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we know. <i>Please</i> stop,&rdquo; he spoke fast, leaving Stephanie speechless. She parted her smudged red lips to say something, but then Mason showed up, unlike his wife, he was completely naked under his white bathrobe which wasn&rsquo;t even tied at the front.</p><p>Harry immediately covered Y/N&rsquo;s eyes, dashing his own back on Mason&rsquo;s face so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to look at <i>that thing</i> for another second. Y/N might&rsquo;ve seen it too because she was trying so hard to contain her laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Put your dick away, for fuck&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I forgot,&rdquo; said the older man who quickly tied the strings together to cover himself up.</p><p>Stephanie gave the other couple one last glance before telling Mason she&rsquo;d wait for him in bed. Harry really wished he could listen to those words without thinking about the thing he&rsquo;d heard earlier in his room. How was he gonna sleep tonight if <i>that</i> was what he might wake up to?</p><p>&ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo; he narrowed his eyes at Mason. It was clear he was losing his temper, but he was still trying to be as nice as he possibly could. Because treat people with kindness right?<i> Yeah, people, not Mason. Fuck Mason.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait for me inside, love,&rdquo; Harry said to his wife, who pouted yet listened to him anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take too long,&rdquo; she told him before retreating to their room. Harry watched the door close behind her as he heaved a sigh. This conversation wouldn&rsquo;t have been necessary if he could&rsquo;ve just punched the asshole. But on second thought, he shouldn&rsquo;t waste a good hit on someone like him.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck was this?&rdquo; Harry asked, throwing his hands in the air. &ldquo;I get that you always feel the need to prove that you&rsquo;re better than me, but to book the same fucking resort, <i>and</i> the room right next to mine just to piss me off is what only a psychopath would do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You self-centered prick.&rdquo; Mason scoffed, leaning against the door. &ldquo;You really think everything I do is about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry lifted his eyebrow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>think</i>. I <i>know </i>everything you do is because you cannot stand the fact that Y/N and I are happier than you and Steph.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please. The last thing I worry about is you being better than me at anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The next time you say that, make sure to keep your <i>tiny</i> friend covered.&rdquo; Harry didn&rsquo;t even bother to stay and see his cousin&rsquo;s reaction to the comment. He stormed back to his room, hoping Mason would get insecure enough to keep the noise down when they\u2014</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Harry asked, but there was not a single sound except for his wife&rsquo;s soft snoring as she was now sprawling across their bed. It&rsquo;d be a lie to say he was disappointed, but seeing her adorable sleeping face really made him happy again. In silence, he lied down by her side, trying not to cause too much movement and wake her up.</p><p>&ldquo;You forgot to say you love me tonight, drunkie.&rdquo; His eyelids fluttered from exhaustion as he watched Y/N smiling in her sleep. Even though he couldn&rsquo;t read her mind, he&rsquo;d like to think that it was him she was dreaming about. So while stroking her hair the way she liked, he mumbled to her what he never forgot to say every night before bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my entire world, and I really love you.&rdquo; </p><p>Then he drifted off gradually.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The next morning, as expected, Y/N barely remembered anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Beside me talking to a palm tree&hellip;&rdquo; she cringed, trying to recollect the night before, but all that she could remember was asking Harry to dance with her on the beach. &ldquo;Did I do anything else embarrassing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You tried to tear off my clothes and begged to suck me off,&rdquo; said Harry as he took a sip of his orange juice, flashing her a subtle smirk when her face reddened, certainly not because of the heat out here. What was better than having breakfast by the ocean, feeling the cool breezes on a hot summer day, <i>and</i> poking fun at your wife for the silly things she did when she was drunk? He was having the best morning.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember that&hellip;&rdquo; She mumbled, stealing a glance at him while his eyes were glued on her.</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not everything&hellip;only a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow when she pouted at him. He knew she wanted him to change the subject, but he enjoyed teasing her too much to let her off that easily.</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t this shy when you literally asked me to fuck you on the beach last night.&rdquo; He chuckled, making her blush even harder as she kicked his leg under the table.</p><p>&ldquo;There are children around here! They might hear you!&rdquo;</p><p>Now that she mentioned, Harry looked around and noticed a family of four sitting right beside them. The parents were too caught up in their own conversation to hear what he was saying, and the child around four was singing while playing with her action figures. Harry&rsquo;s laughter died down soon, yet the smile lingered on his face when the little girl saw him looking and waved at him. He waved back, feeling his heart flutter somehow. </p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t see what was going on as she was texting this whole time. She had to give her mother updates on basically everything she&rsquo;d been doing (beside her getting drunk and them having sex every single chance they got), because to her mother apparently, she&rsquo;d stopped growing since the age of fourteen.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N flinched to meet her husband&rsquo;s eyes when she turned back to him. He was just smiling at her in silence with his chin resting on his knuckles. She couldn&rsquo;t figure out what that meant. &ldquo;Is there something on my face?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beauty.&rdquo; His unexpected answer got her laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;See? This is why I don&rsquo;t believe in your compliments anymore.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes and told him to eat since they had some sightseeing to do later. Harry didn&rsquo;t mind his breakfast getting cold though. His eyes stayed on Y/N, watching her slightly nodding her head to the song on the vintage radio at the bar. His lips curved to form a little grin. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t tell her exactly what was on his mind when the kid at the other table waved at him. They&rsquo;d had this talk, and both agreed to wait another year or two before making the big decision. Because let&rsquo;s be honest, now they couldn&rsquo;t spend much time with their cat let alone a human baby. But Harry guessed it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to just imagine little versions of themselves running around their house. And he really looked forward to that day.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, somehow they managed to stay away from Mason and Stephanie and had the best time of their life exploring the island. Thus they assumed their second day here would continue to be this great. What they forgot was that, <i>every time</i> they drew a conclusion this early, they ended up with at least one disappointing surprise towards the end.</p><p>&ldquo;Harold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; Harry muttered as he turned away from the bar and gave his cousin a death glare. &ldquo;Do I need to file a restraining order?&rdquo;</p><p>Normally Y/N would remind him to tone down his feelings of hatred, but after last night (Harry had filled her in on everything that she didn&rsquo;t remember) it was hard to continue being nice. She was just trying her best not to laugh at how offended both Mason and Stephanie seemed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to apologize actually. I hope we can forget what happened as we were all drunk anyway,&rdquo; Mason said, giving out his hand for Harry to shake. But instead of doing just that, Harry glanced at the hand, back to Mason&rsquo;s face. With a sarcastic smile, he straight off said, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>, now leave us alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Harold. You cannot blame me for what happened to your father&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Harry squinted his eyes as soon as he heard. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>Mason and Stephanie exchanged looks as if they were also surprised that Harry had no clue about his father&rsquo;s decision. Quickly, Stephanie grabbed Y/N by the arm, pulling the perplexed young woman out of her chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Come swim with me, Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I&hellip;can&rsquo;t swim,&rdquo; Y/N muttered, turning to her husband for help, but he was too busy staring at his cousin in disbelief to notice her.</p><p>&ldquo;Just come with me, so they can talk,&rdquo; Stephanie insisted. She didn&rsquo;t even give Y/N time to say no and just dragged her out of the restaurant anyway. It was then that Harry finally got a grip on reality. He shifted in his chair, eyebrows furrowed as he asked Mason to explain everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Devlin&rsquo;s gonna sell Styles Corporation. I gave him that idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s mouth fell open. Mason, on the other hand, sat down and ordered a beer as he remained impassive. Harry completely understood that Mason had nothing to do with Styles Corporation, thus it was normal for him to not feel anything. What made Harry angry, was the fact that Mason had suggested Devlin to sell the brainchild he probably loved more than his real ones.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sacrificed a lot to build his own empire from scratch! You can&rsquo;t just convince him to sell it!&rdquo; Harry slammed his hand onto the counter, receiving a few questioning glances from the other people, yet he was too upset to care.</p><p>&ldquo;You think my opinion alone could get your old man to sell the company?&rdquo; Mason snorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Devlin we&rsquo;re talking about here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He cannot run it forever, Harold. Your sister is a travel photographer, <i>you</i> were his only hope until you turned on him at the last minute. What choice does he have left?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart fell as he heard those words. He hadn&rsquo;t expected that news, especially for it to come from his least favorite person on the planet. Though he was still mad at Devlin for choosing the company over his own son, and not showing up at the wedding over saying sorry, he honestly felt bad for the fate of Styles Corporation. It obviously was a stab in the guts to hand everything you&rsquo;d built up from the ground up to strangers. But what could Harry do to change it? He couldn&rsquo;t leave his wife here, or convince her to leave her job and move to San Francisco. </p><p>With his head in his hand, Harry began to ponder, which was the last thing he should do now that he was supposed to be on a vacation. <i>Fuck everything</i>, he thought. Fuck Mason for telling him this, for being here, <i>and</i> for existing. He blamed it on Mason because it was easier this way. He didn&rsquo;t have to face the music, knowing it was his own fault.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N and Harry weren&rsquo;t strangers to bad luck, but <i>this </i>was a whole new level.</p><p>All she had wanted was a drama free honeymoon with the love of her life and to spend everyday under the sun or getting naked and tangling up in bed. Now here she was, taking Instagram photos for Stephanie by the resort pool, while Harry was probably being tortured by Mason boasting about things that nobody cared about.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, you&rsquo;re right. The lighting sucks,&rdquo; Stephanie mumbled in annoyance as she checked the photos on her phone.<br/></p><p>Y/N really wanted to be frank and tell the girl only idiots would expect moonlight to look flattering on photos taken by an iPhone, but she thought it would be quite mean and decided to be subtly sarcastic instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should choose a better time when there&rsquo;s the sun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot stand too long in the sun, I get burnt easily,&rdquo; Stephanie chuckled, too busy staring at photos of herself to see that eye-roll Y/N had just given her.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I should get back to my husband.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Stephanie took the girl&rsquo;s wrist before she could turn away, pulling her back. &ldquo;Look, since we&rsquo;re kind of like sisters now\u2014&rdquo;</p><p><i>Fuck me</i>, muttered the voice inside Y/N&rsquo;s head as she widened her eyes and faked a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I just wanna be honest with you.&rdquo; Stephanie took a deep breath, lifting an eyebrow. &ldquo;Why Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re kinda smart. You really wanna spend the rest of your life with someone like him?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Excuse me?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Harry is the smartest man I know.&rdquo;</p><p><i>And YOU shouldn&rsquo;t be judging him when you&rsquo;re the dumbest person I know.</i></p><p>&ldquo;If he was so smart, he wouldn&rsquo;t have turned down an opportunity to be the future CEO of the Styles Corporation. Unlike Mason, he&rsquo;s a disappointment in the family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Mason got everything from pure luck. Harry, on the other hand, has worked hard for the things that he loves. He&rsquo;s got a career and a bright future, and I&rsquo;m very proud of him.&rdquo; Y/N knew she shouldn&rsquo;t be fuming over the words of someone as shallow as Stephanie, yet she couldn&rsquo;t help but get all riled up when all of those insults were for her husband.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s he gonna take care of you and buy you nice clothes with his salary now?&rdquo; Stephanie&rsquo;s argument made Y/N laugh, definitely <i>not</i> because it was funny.</p><p>&ldquo;I have my own job and I can buy my own clothes.&rdquo; She furrowed her brows, stabbing a finger at the blonde who was slightly surprised by the reaction she received. &ldquo;<i>You</i>, however, live off your husband because without him you are nothing. Face it, Steph, you&rsquo;re going nowhere with your non-existent model career.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Stephanie gasped. It was funny how offended she got after having said all those mean things about Harry earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you heard me.&rdquo; This time, Y/N wouldn&rsquo;t give this woman the satisfaction she wanted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever talk shit about my husband again. Are we clear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re threatening me?&rdquo; The part-time model scoffed as she flipped her hair. &ldquo;What are you gonna do? You think I&rsquo;m scared of a weak little girl who cannot swim?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you\u2014<i>AHHHHH!</i>&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Mom! That lady just pushed the other lady into the pool!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry flew right out of his chair after hearing what the little girl said to her mother. He rushed outside in a flash, worrying it might be Y/N and Stephanie for he knew his cousin&rsquo;s wife was crazy as fuck. So if anything happened to\u2014</p><p>&ldquo;Honey?&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, it <i>was</i> Y/N and Stephanie. But his wife was standing by the pool, dry and safe, while the other girl was screaming and struggling violently in the water like a drowning cat.</p><p>&ldquo;You crazy bitch! You fucking psychopath! Get me out of here! Help! Anyone?!&rdquo; <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Drop the act! This is a kiddie pool!&rdquo; Y/N shouted at Stephanie as Harry gave his woman a smirk, looking shocked <i>and</i> proud at the same time. &ldquo;Say those things about my husband again, and I&rsquo;ll push you off a cliff!&rdquo;</p><p>Morally speaking, Harry <i>should</i> care about the fact that his wife had assaulted his cousin&rsquo;s wife, and all the other guests were judging them so hard right now. But all that he really cared about was how much seeing her like this turned him on. This was the first time he&rsquo;d got to witness the protective side of Y/N, <i>so fucking badass. </i>And he was certainly <i>not</i> disappointed at all.</p><p><i>Go wifey!</i></p><p>&ldquo;You okay, baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fin\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s okay! She&rsquo;s a lunatic!&rdquo; Stephanie screamed as she climbed out of the pool and Mason showed up with a towel to cover her up.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck, mate?&rdquo; He snarled at Harry, pointing at Y/N. &ldquo;Your wife just threatened to push my wife off a cliff!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please Mason, you two aren&rsquo;t saints.&rdquo; Harry rolled his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t know what those two expected, as if he hadn&rsquo;t thought of pushing one them off a cliff before.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, honey, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Y/N as she took her husband&rsquo;s hand and turned to walk away. It could&rsquo;ve ended there, with no one getting hurt (besides Stephanie who was soaked from head to toes), but just as expected, Mason never wanted to miss a chance to say the last words.</p><p>&ldquo;Your wife is bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said, your wife is a\u2014&rdquo; Mason was cut off by a fist in the face that knocked him to the ground. While everyone else who&rsquo;d witnessed that punch was in utter shock, Harry had <i>never</i> felt better. He&rsquo;d wanted to do that for his whole life. </p><p>Before Mason could pick himself up and wipe the blood off his nose, Harry and Y/N had already fled the scene. The last thing they wanted was to get into trouble for causing disruption. At first, Y/N was really scared though it wasn&rsquo;t the first time she&rsquo;d seen Harry hit someone. But as soon as they made it to the beach, she started squealing in joy.</p><p>&ldquo;That was amazing! I pushed her into the pool, and you punched him in the face! We&rsquo;re like the best couple ever!&rdquo;</p><p>The way she was all giggly and bouncing up and down like a child made Harry laugh so hard. He took her hand and pulled her back into his arms. Hers came wrapped around his waist like an instinct.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too happy for someone who just assaulted a woman,&rdquo; he said, stroking her cheeks to gain back a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Now I know why Layla does things like this! She&rsquo;ll be so proud of me when I tell her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo; Harry faked a frown. &ldquo;Should I be worried that you&rsquo;re turning into Layla?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if it makes you feel better, I only <i>Layla</i> for you.&rdquo; Her answer got him chuckling and shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna kill us both if she knows we&rsquo;re using her as a verb,&rdquo; he said, pressing a kiss to the tip of her nose. &ldquo;But thank you, for defending me.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo; </i>Y/N narrowed her eyes as she emphasized those two words. &ldquo;No one is allowed to make fun of my husband, beside me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aww.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aaaand Layla, because you know, I&rsquo;m afraid of her.&rdquo;</p><p>They held each other while laughing. It was nice for Harry to stop thinking about his father&rsquo;s company, and enjoying the presence of the woman he loved instead. They continued walking barefoot along the beach, listening to the lullaby of the waves, and breathing deeply the ocean carried air. It was romantic at first with the starry sky right above them. But all it took was one moment, when both of them stopped and just stared at each other, for their self-control to cave in at once.</p><p>The next thing they knew was them hiding in the shadow of a palm tree, she was pressed against the brick wall, with her legs wrapped around his waist, and her hands in his hair. His shorts were halfway down his ass and her panties were somewhere on the sand. She would definitely not put them back on after they were done. </p><p>&ldquo;What did I do to deserve you?&rdquo; Harry tried not to be rough, but he making sure every thrust was worthwhile. He dragged his lips down her jawline as she filled his ears with her angelic whimpers that he could never get tired of. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; he said, gripping her ass to move her hips in sync with his own.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; She let a soft gasp escape when he hit just the right spot that caused her eyes to roll upward, and the sound of his name to pour out from her wet lips. She was too lost in the moment to care if anyone heard her. There was not a single soul around anyway, so Harry didn&rsquo;t bother to silence his wife, not when he loved how vocal she was just for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit love&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo; He thrust faster, face contorted from pleasure. &ldquo;Gonna come&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fill me.&rdquo; Those breathless words and her grinding down on him to get him deeper was all it took for Harry to explode, groaning into her mouth as he felt her walls squeezing around him. Her eyes fell shut, her head tossed back, and now she couldn&rsquo;t stop whimpering meaningless words, the only thing that made sense was his name.</p><p>&ldquo;We finally had sex on the beach, you happy?&rdquo; He jokingly asked while still catching his breath, his hooded eyes stared right into hers.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dick,&rdquo; she said, smiling at the way his eyes sparkled in the dark like those stars right above them. That playful insult only made him chortle. He brought his mouth back on hers to kiss her tenderly.</p><p>&ldquo;And also your husband, so you&rsquo;re stuck with this dick for the rest of your life,&rdquo; he spoke against her lips, causing her to dissolve into laughter. Harry temporarily forgot about the fate of his father&rsquo;s company, and the stress he felt thinking he was the reason for it. At this moment, there were only them and them alone, though he knew it couldn&rsquo;t be them forever. When this week was over they would have to return to their busy lives. So now he must hold her closer, not wanting another second to go to waste.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Did you know that Niall almost lost Treasure when he took her to the mall with him?&rdquo; Y/N said the second she showed up at their bedroom door with the cat in her arms. Harry had just finished getting dressed for work. He turned away from the mirror and flashed his wife a cheeky grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Treasure tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>She snorted, rolling her eyes and put the cat down on their bed to come fix his collar. &ldquo;Layla told me&hellip;We should let Ben and Nam watch Treasure next time we&rsquo;re away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; He nodded. It was then that she finally looked up and caught the way he was staring at her. Neither of them said a word. After many years under the same roof, they didn&rsquo;t have to speak to know what was on the other person&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried again, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She questioned, placing both hands on his shoulders. &ldquo;I mean&hellip;if you wanna help your dad keep the company\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had this talk, love,&rdquo; he cut her off, seemingly displeased. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;</p><p>When he kissed her on the cheek and attempted to go, she squeezed his arms to force his eyes back on her. She&rsquo;d thought a lot about Stephanie&rsquo;s words, and maybe Stephanie was not entirely wrong. Of course she didn&rsquo;t want anything more from Harry, for he&rsquo;d always been more than enough. Despite so she felt awful that he had to give up on such a great opportunity for her. If he&rsquo;d never met her, maybe he would&rsquo;ve been rich and much more successful than he was now. He would&rsquo;ve been his own boss and driving nice cars and probably engaged to someone from a rich family. He could&rsquo;ve had it all. The least she could do now as his wife was encourage him to do what was best for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Love, just accept the job, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot leave you here and move to San Francisco.&rdquo; He chuckled, yet she seemed so serious and he knew it wasn&rsquo;t time to joke around.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you and&hellip;and find a new job there&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was paralyzed for a long moment when he heard those words. His wife, who&rsquo;d loved her job more than anything, was willing to drop everything just so he could be the CEO his father expected him to be. And he knew it was all because she loved him and she blamed herself for what she thought he&rsquo;d lost. The truth, however, was that he never needed anything more than her. </p><p>Harry pulled Y/N into his arms, one hand at the back of her head as he whispered into her ear, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s not talk about this anymore, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to work today?&rdquo; He changed the subject, knowing how easy it was for her to get distracted.</p><p>&ldquo;Got a day off.&rdquo; Y/N pressed her lips into a smile as she picked up their cat and followed her husband to the front door. Since Harry was extremely forgetful, they always had to do the <i>'checklist&rsquo;</i> together every morning before leaving home.</p><p>&ldquo;Umbrella?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Already in my bag.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Car key?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry flinched when he stuck his hand into his coat pocket and couldn&rsquo;t find the key. The frantic look on his face made his wife laugh as she handed it to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You left it by the sink&hellip;again,&rdquo; she said, resulting in a smile of relief on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best. Love you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; She called out when he was about to leave. &ldquo;Forgetting something else?&rdquo;</p><p>He shot her a look of confused, until she lifted her face and pointed to her lips, eyes closed. With a smile, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to walk back and kiss her goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now you can go,&rdquo; she said, patting his cheek. &ldquo;Have a great da\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could barely finish her sentence when all of a sudden the door opposite from theirs creaked open. The couple nearly screamed as they saw who it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me?!&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes expanded to the point they could just fall out. &ldquo;Why are <i>you</i> here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is my new place,&rdquo; said Mason, who looked just as pissed off. In all honesty, Y/N and Harry thought this was better than having to deal with his pretentious <i>'kindness&rsquo;.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you knew we lived here, asshole,&rdquo; Harry snarled at him. &ldquo;You expect us to believe this is another coincidence?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You actually think we remembered your address and your flat number so we could get this flat because we&rsquo;re so obsessed with you?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded fast. &ldquo;Yeah, Mason, that&rsquo;s exactly what we think.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry threw his hands in the air, face screwed up as he turned to his wife. &ldquo;What kind of shitty alternate universe is this?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you complaining? I&rsquo;m the one with crazy neighbors here.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry turned a deaf ear to his cousin&rsquo;s insult. He would love to stay and start another fight, but he didn&rsquo;t want this asshole to be the reason he was late for work. He said goodbye to his wife, yet before leaving, he didn&rsquo;t forget to give Mason the finger and walked off without a second look back.</p><p>Y/N watched him go with heart eyes a wide smile on her face, while Mason could not look anymore irritated. That was when Stephanie showed up at the door, holding a yellow cat. The woman looked as shocked as her husband to see Y/N standing there. It was Treasure who broke the hostile silence. She meowed loudly, probably excited to see her new cat neighbor. But Stephanie didn&rsquo;t seem so fond of the idea of their two cats being friends. Giving Y/N a look of disgust, she told her pet, &ldquo;<i>Tiger</i>, stop looking at that dirty creature. You might get eye cancer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then I&rsquo;m already blind from looking at you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N walked in and slammed the door shut, not wanting to hear more from Stephanie. Now that they were alone and away from their evil new neighbors, she gave Treasure a stern look. &ldquo;<i>Do not</i> associate with that family, you understand me?&rdquo;</p><p>The car purred softly in response, and Y/N hoped the answer was yes.</p>",

Y/N tugged at his arm, covering her mouth so she wouldn\u2019t laugh too hard and draw even more attention to them.</p><p>\u201cYou just said \u2019<i>thank you very much</i>\u2019 in German, H!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t what he said in German?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said \u2019<i>welcome to Greece</i>\u2019 in Greek because we\u2019re in Greece! Why would a staff in a Greek resort speak German?!\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>When seeing how amazed he was, Y/N could\u2019t help but chuckle as she interlocked their fingers, flashing him a cheeky grin. \u201cI may or may not have done a bit of research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, my wife\u2019s gonna be my little translator on this trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife only knows <i>\u2018good morning\u2019</i> and <i>'good night\u2019</i> so you\u2019re not so lucky, Mr. Styles,\u201d she said, tip-toeing to peck his lips, but he was quick to lock one arm around her waist to kiss her passionately. That kiss could\u2019ve turned into a full make out session if she hadn\u2019t come to her senses and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cCan you be horny later when we\u2019re alone?\u201d</p><p>Her pink cheeks made Harry snort in amusement. He ran his hand up and down her back to rest dangerously close to her bum, which looked extra good in this vintage dress, he must say. \u201cWe\u2019re married. People know we fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do, just <i>not</i> in the resort lobby after arriving only five minutes ago,\u201d she told him, rolling her eyes. </p><p>With his arm wrapped around her, they headed towards the front desk for the check-in procedures and finally received their keys. That moment was by far the happiest they\u2019d ever been since their wedding night. After all, they were on their romantic honeymoon, on a beautiful island in Greece, and they were gonna be there for an entire week, just the two of them. It almost seemed like nothing could go wrong.</p><p><i>Almost</i>.</p><p><i>\u201cHarold?!\u201d</i></p><p>When Harry heard that voice he thought he was hallucinating. But as the voice got louder and more annoying, causing all the other guests as well as the staff to stare at him. He knew it was real.</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d His wife mumbled, she was also rooted to her spot. \u201cDid you hear that or was it just me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God\u2026I heard it too\u2026\u201d He sucked in a breath, turning around slowly as she did the same. Of all the annoying people he\u2019d come across in his entire life up to this point, it just <i>had</i> to be his mortal enemy \u2014 <i>his cousin</i> <i>Mason.</i></p><p>Despite Harry\u2019s hostile glare, the older Styles was beaming. \u201cWhat a lovely coincidence! Are you two on honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here to ruin my life?\u201d</p><p>The question made Mason chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re still funny, Harold. <i>Still</i> funny. I\u2019m actually on a summer vacation with my baby girl. Oh, there she is, my flower!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSweet cheeks! My baby!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna throw up\u2026\u201d Y/N whispered to her husband, receiving a smirk from him.</p><p>Stephanie showed up, wearing the biggest hat that covered half of her face as she strutted towards the three of them in her yellow summer dress. She\u2019d left all of her heavy luggage to the poor resort staff, who nearly got hit in the head by her throwing her handbag at him.</p><p>\u201cThe other Styles!\u201d She giggled, finally taking off her hat to pull the other couple into a hug. If Harry hadn\u2019t pushed her away, who knew how long she would\u2019ve kept squeezing them? \u201cWe missed your wedding! I think your invitation got lost in the mail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBold of you to think we sent you one.\u201d</p><p>Y/N quickly nudged Harry as she chuckled nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Steph\u2026We also missed your wedding so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come to your second ones!\u201d</p><p>Stephanie and her husband both fell about laughing at her rude joke. The kind of looks Harry and Y/N exchanged at that moment couldn\u2019t be more obvious that they\u2019d rather set themselves on fire than continue this dumb conversation. They were just too nice (or at least Y/N was) to say <i>'fuck off\u2019</i> and walk away.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to our room now,\u201d Y/N said, holding Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cNice talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Harry! Bye Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Y/N heard Stephanie loud and clear but she didn\u2019t look back and just stride as fast as possible towards the lift.</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight at the bar, Harold!\u201d</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, responded to his cousin with a middle finger in the air, and once again Y/N had to tug at his sleeve to tell him to be polite.</p><p>\u201cSuch a funny kid,\u201d Mason told his wife with a grin, before heading to the front desk.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The newlyweds\u2019 first day on the island wasn\u2019t so bad, minus the encounter with the other annoying couple that they hated more than Mondays. They got to spend a lot of time together soaked in the sun and the golden sand, and <i>not</i> thinking about the responsibilities they had back in London. As busy as they were with their own jobs, they rarely had time to have fun like they used to back when they were students. Now was the one chance for them to try everything they hadn\u2019t done before.</p><p>\u201cI hope nearly fucking your husband on the beach while being drunk off your ass was on your bucket list.\u201d Harry laughed as he dragged his wife out of the lift, and struggled to get the room card from his pocket while she was clinging onto him like a koala.</p><p>Normally, he would stop her from drinking too much. He always knew she could barely handle alcohol, but since they were on vacation, he made it an exception and let her do whatever she wanted. As a result, she was wasted and he was exhausted from making sure she didn\u2019t cause any trouble. His wife was a fun drunk, but every time she drank too much, it was always hard work for him. He had to make sure she didn\u2019t walk straight into a lamppost, get hit by a car for dancing on the street, or take off her clothes in public because she thought they were alone.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she mumbled, shoving two fingers in his face as he opened the door. \u201c<i>Two</i> days into our marriage\u2026and you already don\u2019t want to have sex with me anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure if you didn\u2019t count those two orgasms earlier.\u201d Harry laughed quietly. He just loved having silly conversations with her while she was not in her right mind to make any sense. </p><p>With a bit of difficulty, he shut the door after they\u2019d got in, and somehow managed to put her down on their bed. That was when Y/N started giggling like a madwoman, watching her husband stand with both hands on his hips and a confused grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cHubby, come give me a kiss!\u201d She tried to open her eyes to look at him, but they were fighting to stay shut, so she just opened her arms and gave him a silly grin. Harry took off her shoes as well as his own, then fell down onto the bed right by her side. He propped himself up on his elbow, pressing his lips to her temple.</p><p>\u201cNo! A real kiss!\u201d Y/N pouted. She didn\u2019t wait for his reaction to grab him by the collar of his shirt and kiss him hard on the mouth. Harry was a bit shocked considering how shy Y/N was most of the time. Actually, she\u2019d gained much more confidence after that many years they\u2019d been together. But shyness was just her nature, and he loved that about her.</p><p>Only when she\u2019d had a couple drinks did she get this bold. This was certainly <i>not</i> the first time, but Harry didn\u2019t think he could ever grow used to it. Soon he was right between her legs, one hand supporting his own weight as the other held her by the hip. Her black dress rose up to reveal the black lace underwear he\u2019d got for her. He intended to make a cheeky comment about it, yet she was already unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re <i>really</i> drunk,\u201d he whispered against her lips, chuckling lowly as she groaned like a spoiled little girl who didn\u2019t get the pony she asked for.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not on the beach anymore,\u201d she reasoned, eyebrows furrowed at him and opened his shirt to get her hands on his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, baby. Greece really does make you horny, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> make me horny.\u201d</p><p>Harry was taken aback for the second time that night, not only by her confidence but also by her flipping them over to straddle him. He tried to speak, yet she covered his mouth with her own, pressing both hands on his chest, pushing him down.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shushed him immediately. Holding his gaze, she moved slowly downward, wasting no time to pull down his shorts and wrapped her hands around his pulsing member. A growl escaped his throat as he shuddered at the feeling of her hot breath against him. When she gave him a slight squeeze, his hips buckled up, urging her to give him more. He was leaking and desperate for her touch, definitely not in the position to call it quit at this point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you in the palm of my hand,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice. <i>\u201cLiterally.\u201d</i></p><p>The sound of her name escaped his pink lips in a breathy tone. When he saw the way her pupils dilate even in the dim moonlight from their balcony door, he knew he was fucked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a good girl.\u201d <i>Fuck</i>. \u201cLet me suck you off, please?\u201d <i>Fuck. Me.</i></p><p>Harry exhaled harshly, too out of his mind to even think straight as he stroked her hair. \u201cY-Yes\u2026yes, you are\u2026<i>Fuck</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>She nodded, finally giving him a few slow strokes. Harry\u2019s eyes squeezed shut in an instant as his entire face contorted. He was afraid this would end so quickly that her forgetting all about tonight might seem like a good thing. Just as he was about to ask her to go faster, a loud <i>thump!</i> caused Y/N to sit up straight, eyes just as wide as his. The bed in the room next door was violently banging against the wall, as the couple over there didn\u2019t make an effort to keep it down.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck yeah, baby! Fuck me! Fuck me hard!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is\u2026<i>that?</i>\u201d A look of terror flashed across Harry\u2019s face when he made eye-contact with a giggly Y/N. She had no idea what was going on, but everything was hilarious to her when she was drunk. As much as he wanted to ignore that horny couple to go back to his own business, he couldn\u2019t even <i>think</i> with all the noises those people were making. In a second, he sat up and tucked himself back inside his shorts, pecking Y/N\u2019s lips as he told her he would go talk to them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, hands on his shoulders. \u201cStay with me, Harry\u2026I need you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s self-control unraveled when she moaned his name that way. Nodding fast, he attached their mouths once again as she cupped his cheeks and kissed him with everything she\u2019d got. He tried to focus on her, he <i>really</i> did, until he heard the name of the <i>last</i> person he wanted to think of when he was about to have sex with his wife.</p><p><i>\u201cMason! Yes, that\u2019s right baby!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo, no, non no!\u201d Harry cried out, pulling away immediately. Though Y/N wasn\u2019t sober enough to get disgusted by the other two, she still agreed to get off her husband and follow him outside. As he knocked on the room next door, she hugged him from behind and rested her head on his back. Drunk Y/N always got a bit clingy, and Harry loved it actually. If only he could pay attention to her and take care of her instead of having to deal with his fucked up cousin.</p><p>When he knocked a couple more times, it was Stephanie who came to open the door, wearing only her lingerie. Harry had to stare at the ceiling while silently thanking god that the woman wasn\u2019t naked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Harry and Y/N! What a surprise! We were just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we know. <i>Please</i> stop,\u201d he spoke fast, leaving Stephanie speechless. She parted her smudged red lips to say something, but then Mason showed up, unlike his wife, he was completely naked under his white bathrobe which wasn\u2019t even tied at the front.</p><p>Harry immediately covered Y/N\u2019s eyes, dashing his own back on Mason\u2019s face so he wouldn\u2019t have to look at <i>that thing</i> for another second. Y/N might\u2019ve seen it too because she was trying so hard to contain her laughter.</p><p>\u201cPut your dick away, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I forgot,\u201d said the older man who quickly tied the strings together to cover himself up.</p><p>Stephanie gave the other couple one last glance before telling Mason she\u2019d wait for him in bed. Harry really wished he could listen to those words without thinking about the thing he\u2019d heard earlier in his room. How was he gonna sleep tonight if <i>that</i> was what he might wake up to?</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he narrowed his eyes at Mason. It was clear he was losing his temper, but he was still trying to be as nice as he possibly could. Because treat people with kindness right?<i> Yeah, people, not Mason. Fuck Mason.</i></p><p>\u201cWait for me inside, love,\u201d Harry said to his wife, who pouted yet listened to him anyway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long,\u201d she told him before retreating to their room. Harry watched the door close behind her as he heaved a sigh. This conversation wouldn\u2019t have been necessary if he could\u2019ve just punched the asshole. But on second thought, he shouldn\u2019t waste a good hit on someone like him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was this?\u201d Harry asked, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cI get that you always feel the need to prove that you\u2019re better than me, but to book the same fucking resort, <i>and</i> the room right next to mine just to piss me off is what only a psychopath would do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou self-centered prick.\u201d Mason scoffed, leaning against the door. \u201cYou really think everything I do is about you?\u201d</p><p>Harry lifted his eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>think</i>. I <i>know </i>everything you do is because you cannot stand the fact that Y/N and I are happier than you and Steph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. The last thing I worry about is you being better than me at anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time you say that, make sure to keep your <i>tiny</i> friend covered.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t even bother to stay and see his cousin\u2019s reaction to the comment. He stormed back to his room, hoping Mason would get insecure enough to keep the noise down when they\u2014</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Harry asked, but there was not a single sound except for his wife\u2019s soft snoring as she was now sprawling across their bed. It\u2019d be a lie to say he was disappointed, but seeing her adorable sleeping face really made him happy again. In silence, he lied down by her side, trying not to cause too much movement and wake her up.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to say you love me tonight, drunkie.\u201d His eyelids fluttered from exhaustion as he watched Y/N smiling in her sleep. Even though he couldn\u2019t read her mind, he\u2019d like to think that it was him she was dreaming about. So while stroking her hair the way she liked, he mumbled to her what he never forgot to say every night before bed. \u201cYou\u2019re my entire world, and I really love you.\u201d </p><p>Then he drifted off gradually.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The next morning, as expected, Y/N barely remembered anything.</p><p>\u201cBeside me talking to a palm tree\u2026\u201d she cringed, trying to recollect the night before, but all that she could remember was asking Harry to dance with her on the beach. \u201cDid I do anything else embarrassing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to tear off my clothes and begged to suck me off,\u201d said Harry as he took a sip of his orange juice, flashing her a subtle smirk when her face reddened, certainly not because of the heat out here. What was better than having breakfast by the ocean, feeling the cool breezes on a hot summer day, <i>and</i> poking fun at your wife for the silly things she did when she was drunk? He was having the best morning.</p><p>\u201cI remember that\u2026\u201d She mumbled, stealing a glance at him while his eyes were glued on her.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything\u2026only a bit.\u201d</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow when she pouted at him. He knew she wanted him to change the subject, but he enjoyed teasing her too much to let her off that easily.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t this shy when you literally asked me to fuck you on the beach last night.\u201d He chuckled, making her blush even harder as she kicked his leg under the table.</p><p>\u201cThere are children around here! They might hear you!\u201d</p><p>Now that she mentioned, Harry looked around and noticed a family of four sitting right beside them. The parents were too caught up in their own conversation to hear what he was saying, and the child around four was singing while playing with her action figures. Harry\u2019s laughter died down soon, yet the smile lingered on his face when the little girl saw him looking and waved at him. He waved back, feeling his heart flutter somehow. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t see what was going on as she was texting this whole time. She had to give her mother updates on basically everything she\u2019d been doing (beside her getting drunk and them having sex every single chance they got), because to her mother apparently, she\u2019d stopped growing since the age of fourteen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N flinched to meet her husband\u2019s eyes when she turned back to him. He was just smiling at her in silence with his chin resting on his knuckles. She couldn\u2019t figure out what that meant. \u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauty.\u201d His unexpected answer got her laughing.</p><p>\u201cSee? This is why I don\u2019t believe in your compliments anymore.\u201d She rolled her eyes and told him to eat since they had some sightseeing to do later. Harry didn\u2019t mind his breakfast getting cold though. His eyes stayed on Y/N, watching her slightly nodding her head to the song on the vintage radio at the bar. His lips curved to form a little grin. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell her exactly what was on his mind when the kid at the other table waved at him. They\u2019d had this talk, and both agreed to wait another year or two before making the big decision. Because let\u2019s be honest, now they couldn\u2019t spend much time with their cat let alone a human baby. But Harry guessed it wouldn\u2019t hurt to just imagine little versions of themselves running around their house. And he really looked forward to that day.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, somehow they managed to stay away from Mason and Stephanie and had the best time of their life exploring the island. Thus they assumed their second day here would continue to be this great. What they forgot was that, <i>every time</i> they drew a conclusion this early, they ended up with at least one disappointing surprise towards the end.</p><p>\u201cHarold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Harry muttered as he turned away from the bar and gave his cousin a death glare. \u201cDo I need to file a restraining order?\u201d</p><p>Normally Y/N would remind him to tone down his feelings of hatred, but after last night (Harry had filled her in on everything that she didn\u2019t remember) it was hard to continue being nice. She was just trying her best not to laugh at how offended both Mason and Stephanie seemed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to apologize actually. I hope we can forget what happened as we were all drunk anyway,\u201d Mason said, giving out his hand for Harry to shake. But instead of doing just that, Harry glanced at the hand, back to Mason\u2019s face. With a sarcastic smile, he straight off said, \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>, now leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Harold. You cannot blame me for what happened to your father\u2019s company.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry squinted his eyes as soon as he heard. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Mason and Stephanie exchanged looks as if they were also surprised that Harry had no clue about his father\u2019s decision. Quickly, Stephanie grabbed Y/N by the arm, pulling the perplexed young woman out of her chair.</p><p>\u201cCome swim with me, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2026can\u2019t swim,\u201d Y/N muttered, turning to her husband for help, but he was too busy staring at his cousin in disbelief to notice her.</p><p>\u201cJust come with me, so they can talk,\u201d Stephanie insisted. She didn\u2019t even give Y/N time to say no and just dragged her out of the restaurant anyway. It was then that Harry finally got a grip on reality. He shifted in his chair, eyebrows furrowed as he asked Mason to explain everything.</p><p>\u201cDevlin\u2019s gonna sell Styles Corporation. I gave him that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Harry\u2019s mouth fell open. Mason, on the other hand, sat down and ordered a beer as he remained impassive. Harry completely understood that Mason had nothing to do with Styles Corporation, thus it was normal for him to not feel anything. What made Harry angry, was the fact that Mason had suggested Devlin to sell the brainchild he probably loved more than his real ones.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sacrificed a lot to build his own empire from scratch! You can\u2019t just convince him to sell it!\u201d Harry slammed his hand onto the counter, receiving a few questioning glances from the other people, yet he was too upset to care.</p><p>\u201cYou think my opinion alone could get your old man to sell the company?\u201d Mason snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s Devlin we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot run it forever, Harold. Your sister is a travel photographer, <i>you</i> were his only hope until you turned on him at the last minute. What choice does he have left?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s heart fell as he heard those words. He hadn\u2019t expected that news, especially for it to come from his least favorite person on the planet. Though he was still mad at Devlin for choosing the company over his own son, and not showing up at the wedding over saying sorry, he honestly felt bad for the fate of Styles Corporation. It obviously was a stab in the guts to hand everything you\u2019d built up from the ground up to strangers. But what could Harry do to change it? He couldn\u2019t leave his wife here, or convince her to leave her job and move to San Francisco. </p><p>With his head in his hand, Harry began to ponder, which was the last thing he should do now that he was supposed to be on a vacation. <i>Fuck everything</i>, he thought. Fuck Mason for telling him this, for being here, <i>and</i> for existing. He blamed it on Mason because it was easier this way. He didn\u2019t have to face the music, knowing it was his own fault.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N and Harry weren\u2019t strangers to bad luck, but <i>this </i>was a whole new level.</p><p>All she had wanted was a drama free honeymoon with the love of her life and to spend everyday under the sun or getting naked and tangling up in bed. Now here she was, taking Instagram photos for Stephanie by the resort pool, while Harry was probably being tortured by Mason boasting about things that nobody cared about.</p><p>\u201cShit, you\u2019re right. The lighting sucks,\u201d Stephanie mumbled in annoyance as she checked the photos on her phone.<br></p><p>Y/N really wanted to be frank and tell the girl only idiots would expect moonlight to look flattering on photos taken by an iPhone, but she thought it would be quite mean and decided to be subtly sarcastic instead.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should choose a better time when there\u2019s the sun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot stand too long in the sun, I get burnt easily,\u201d Stephanie chuckled, too busy staring at photos of herself to see that eye-roll Y/N had just given her.</p><p>\u201cI think I should get back to my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Stephanie took the girl\u2019s wrist before she could turn away, pulling her back. \u201cLook, since we\u2019re kind of like sisters now\u2014\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck me</i>, muttered the voice inside Y/N\u2019s head as she widened her eyes and faked a grin.</p><p>\u201cI just wanna be honest with you.\u201d Stephanie took a deep breath, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cWhy Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re kinda smart. You really wanna spend the rest of your life with someone like him?\u201d</p><p><i>Excuse me?</i></p><p>\u201cHarry is the smartest man I know.\u201d</p><p><i>And YOU shouldn\u2019t be judging him when you\u2019re the dumbest person I know.</i></p><p>\u201cIf he was so smart, he wouldn\u2019t have turned down an opportunity to be the future CEO of the Styles Corporation. Unlike Mason, he\u2019s a disappointment in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mason got everything from pure luck. Harry, on the other hand, has worked hard for the things that he loves. He\u2019s got a career and a bright future, and I\u2019m very proud of him.\u201d Y/N knew she shouldn\u2019t be fuming over the words of someone as shallow as Stephanie, yet she couldn\u2019t help but get all riled up when all of those insults were for her husband.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he gonna take care of you and buy you nice clothes with his salary now?\u201d Stephanie\u2019s argument made Y/N laugh, definitely <i>not</i> because it was funny.</p><p>\u201cI have my own job and I can buy my own clothes.\u201d She furrowed her brows, stabbing a finger at the blonde who was slightly surprised by the reaction she received. \u201c<i>You</i>, however, live off your husband because without him you are nothing. Face it, Steph, you\u2019re going nowhere with your non-existent model career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Stephanie gasped. It was funny how offended she got after having said all those mean things about Harry earlier.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you heard me.\u201d This time, Y/N wouldn\u2019t give this woman the satisfaction she wanted. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever talk shit about my husband again. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re threatening me?\u201d The part-time model scoffed as she flipped her hair. \u201cWhat are you gonna do? You think I\u2019m scared of a weak little girl who cannot swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014<i>AHHHHH!</i>\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cMom! That lady just pushed the other lady into the pool!\u201d</i></p><p>Harry flew right out of his chair after hearing what the little girl said to her mother. He rushed outside in a flash, worrying it might be Y/N and Stephanie for he knew his cousin\u2019s wife was crazy as fuck. So if anything happened to\u2014</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>Yes, it <i>was</i> Y/N and Stephanie. But his wife was standing by the pool, dry and safe, while the other girl was screaming and struggling violently in the water like a drowning cat.</p><p>\u201cYou crazy bitch! You fucking psychopath! Get me out of here! Help! Anyone?!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cDrop the act! This is a kiddie pool!\u201d Y/N shouted at Stephanie as Harry gave his woman a smirk, looking shocked <i>and</i> proud at the same time. \u201cSay those things about my husband again, and I\u2019ll push you off a cliff!\u201d</p><p>Morally speaking, Harry <i>should</i> care about the fact that his wife had assaulted his cousin\u2019s wife, and all the other guests were judging them so hard right now. But all that he really cared about was how much seeing her like this turned him on. This was the first time he\u2019d got to witness the protective side of Y/N, <i>so fucking badass. </i>And he was certainly <i>not</i> disappointed at all.</p><p><i>Go wifey!</i></p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s okay! She\u2019s a lunatic!\u201d Stephanie screamed as she climbed out of the pool and Mason showed up with a towel to cover her up.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, mate?\u201d He snarled at Harry, pointing at Y/N. \u201cYour wife just threatened to push my wife off a cliff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please Mason, you two aren\u2019t saints.\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. He didn\u2019t know what those two expected, as if he hadn\u2019t thought of pushing one them off a cliff before.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey, let\u2019s go,\u201d said Y/N as she took her husband\u2019s hand and turned to walk away. It could\u2019ve ended there, with no one getting hurt (besides Stephanie who was soaked from head to toes), but just as expected, Mason never wanted to miss a chance to say the last words.</p><p>\u201cYour wife is bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, your wife is a\u2014\u201d Mason was cut off by a fist in the face that knocked him to the ground. While everyone else who\u2019d witnessed that punch was in utter shock, Harry had <i>never</i> felt better. He\u2019d wanted to do that for his whole life. </p><p>Before Mason could pick himself up and wipe the blood off his nose, Harry and Y/N had already fled the scene. The last thing they wanted was to get into trouble for causing disruption. At first, Y/N was really scared though it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d seen Harry hit someone. But as soon as they made it to the beach, she started squealing in joy.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing! I pushed her into the pool, and you punched him in the face! We\u2019re like the best couple ever!\u201d</p><p>The way she was all giggly and bouncing up and down like a child made Harry laugh so hard. He took her hand and pulled her back into his arms. Hers came wrapped around his waist like an instinct.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too happy for someone who just assaulted a woman,\u201d he said, stroking her cheeks to gain back a smile.</p><p>\u201cNow I know why Layla does things like this! She\u2019ll be so proud of me when I tell her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d Harry faked a frown. \u201cShould I be worried that you\u2019re turning into Layla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it makes you feel better, I only <i>Layla</i> for you.\u201d Her answer got him chuckling and shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna kill us both if she knows we\u2019re using her as a verb,\u201d he said, pressing a kiss to the tip of her nose. \u201cBut thank you, for defending me.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNo one.\u201d </i>Y/N narrowed her eyes as she emphasized those two words. \u201cNo one is allowed to make fun of my husband, beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaaand Layla, because you know, I\u2019m afraid of her.\u201d</p><p>They held each other while laughing. It was nice for Harry to stop thinking about his father\u2019s company, and enjoying the presence of the woman he loved instead. They continued walking barefoot along the beach, listening to the lullaby of the waves, and breathing deeply the ocean carried air. It was romantic at first with the starry sky right above them. But all it took was one moment, when both of them stopped and just stared at each other, for their self-control to cave in at once.</p><p>The next thing they knew was them hiding in the shadow of a palm tree, she was pressed against the brick wall, with her legs wrapped around his waist, and her hands in his hair. His shorts were halfway down his ass and her panties were somewhere on the sand. She would definitely not put them back on after they were done. </p><p>\u201cWhat did I do to deserve you?\u201d Harry tried not to be rough, but he making sure every thrust was worthwhile. He dragged his lips down her jawline as she filled his ears with her angelic whimpers that he could never get tired of. </p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he said, gripping her ass to move her hips in sync with his own.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d She let a soft gasp escape when he hit just the right spot that caused her eyes to roll upward, and the sound of his name to pour out from her wet lips. She was too lost in the moment to care if anyone heard her. There was not a single soul around anyway, so Harry didn\u2019t bother to silence his wife, not when he loved how vocal she was just for him.</p><p>\u201cShit love\u2026I\u2026\u201d He thrust faster, face contorted from pleasure. \u201cGonna come\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFill me.\u201d Those breathless words and her grinding down on him to get him deeper was all it took for Harry to explode, groaning into her mouth as he felt her walls squeezing around him. Her eyes fell shut, her head tossed back, and now she couldn\u2019t stop whimpering meaningless words, the only thing that made sense was his name.</p><p>\u201cWe finally had sex on the beach, you happy?\u201d He jokingly asked while still catching his breath, his hooded eyes stared right into hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dick,\u201d she said, smiling at the way his eyes sparkled in the dark like those stars right above them. That playful insult only made him chortle. He brought his mouth back on hers to kiss her tenderly.</p><p>\u201cAnd also your husband, so you\u2019re stuck with this dick for the rest of your life,\u201d he spoke against her lips, causing her to dissolve into laughter. Harry temporarily forgot about the fate of his father\u2019s company, and the stress he felt thinking he was the reason for it. At this moment, there were only them and them alone, though he knew it couldn\u2019t be them forever. When this week was over they would have to return to their busy lives. So now he must hold her closer, not wanting another second to go to waste.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Did you know that Niall almost lost Treasure when he took her to the mall with him?\u201d Y/N said the second she showed up at their bedroom door with the cat in her arms. Harry had just finished getting dressed for work. He turned away from the mirror and flashed his wife a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cDid Treasure tell you that?\u201d</p><p>She snorted, rolling her eyes and put the cat down on their bed to come fix his collar. \u201cLayla told me\u2026We should let Ben and Nam watch Treasure next time we\u2019re away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He nodded. It was then that she finally looked up and caught the way he was staring at her. Neither of them said a word. After many years under the same roof, they didn\u2019t have to speak to know what was on the other person\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She questioned, placing both hands on his shoulders. \u201cI mean\u2026if you wanna help your dad keep the company\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had this talk, love,\u201d he cut her off, seemingly displeased. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>When he kissed her on the cheek and attempted to go, she squeezed his arms to force his eyes back on her. She\u2019d thought a lot about Stephanie\u2019s words, and maybe Stephanie was not entirely wrong. Of course she didn\u2019t want anything more from Harry, for he\u2019d always been more than enough. Despite so she felt awful that he had to give up on such a great opportunity for her. If he\u2019d never met her, maybe he would\u2019ve been rich and much more successful than he was now. He would\u2019ve been his own boss and driving nice cars and probably engaged to someone from a rich family. He could\u2019ve had it all. The least she could do now as his wife was encourage him to do what was best for him.</p><p>\u201cLove, just accept the job, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot leave you here and move to San Francisco.\u201d He chuckled, yet she seemed so serious and he knew it wasn\u2019t time to joke around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you and\u2026and find a new job there\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry was paralyzed for a long moment when he heard those words. His wife, who\u2019d loved her job more than anything, was willing to drop everything just so he could be the CEO his father expected him to be. And he knew it was all because she loved him and she blamed herself for what she thought he\u2019d lost. The truth, however, was that he never needed anything more than her. </p><p>Harry pulled Y/N into his arms, one hand at the back of her head as he whispered into her ear, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about this anymore, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to work today?\u201d He changed the subject, knowing how easy it was for her to get distracted.</p><p>\u201cGot a day off.\u201d Y/N pressed her lips into a smile as she picked up their cat and followed her husband to the front door. Since Harry was extremely forgetful, they always had to do the <i>'checklist\u2019</i> together every morning before leaving home.</p><p>\u201cUmbrella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready in my bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar key?\u201d</p><p>Harry flinched when he stuck his hand into his coat pocket and couldn\u2019t find the key. The frantic look on his face made his wife laugh as she handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou left it by the sink\u2026again,\u201d she said, resulting in a smile of relief on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best. Love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d She called out when he was about to leave. \u201cForgetting something else?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look of confused, until she lifted her face and pointed to her lips, eyes closed. With a smile, he didn\u2019t hesitate to walk back and kiss her goodbye.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you can go,\u201d she said, patting his cheek. \u201cHave a great da\u2014\u201d</p><p>Y/N could barely finish her sentence when all of a sudden the door opposite from theirs creaked open. The couple nearly screamed as they saw who it was.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?!\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes expanded to the point they could just fall out. \u201cWhy are <i>you</i> here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my new place,\u201d said Mason, who looked just as pissed off. In all honesty, Y/N and Harry thought this was better than having to deal with his pretentious <i>'kindness\u2019.</i></p><p>\u201cOkay, you knew we lived here, asshole,\u201d Harry snarled at him. \u201cYou expect us to believe this is another coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually think we remembered your address and your flat number so we could get this flat because we\u2019re so obsessed with you?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded fast. \u201cYeah, Mason, that\u2019s exactly what we think.\u201d</p><p>Harry threw his hands in the air, face screwed up as he turned to his wife. \u201cWhat kind of shitty alternate universe is this?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you complaining? I\u2019m the one with crazy neighbors here.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned a deaf ear to his cousin\u2019s insult. He would love to stay and start another fight, but he didn\u2019t want this asshole to be the reason he was late for work. He said goodbye to his wife, yet before leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to give Mason the finger and walked off without a second look back.</p><p>Y/N watched him go with heart eyes a wide smile on her face, while Mason could not look anymore irritated. That was when Stephanie showed up at the door, holding a yellow cat. The woman looked as shocked as her husband to see Y/N standing there. It was Treasure who broke the hostile silence. She meowed loudly, probably excited to see her new cat neighbor. But Stephanie didn\u2019t seem so fond of the idea of their two cats being friends. Giving Y/N a look of disgust, she told her pet, \u201c<i>Tiger</i>, stop looking at that dirty creature. You might get eye cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019m already blind from looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>Y/N walked in and slammed the door shut, not wanting to hear more from Stephanie. Now that they were alone and away from their evil new neighbors, she gave Treasure a stern look. \u201c<i>Do not</i> associate with that family, you understand me?\u201d</p><p>The car purred softly in response, and Y/N hoped the answer was yes.</p></p>",

Y/N tugged at his arm, covering her mouth so she wouldn\u2019t laugh too hard and draw even more attention to them.</p><p>\u201cYou just said \u2019<i>thank you very much</i>\u2019 in German, H!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t what he said in German?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said \u2019<i>welcome to Greece</i>\u2019 in Greek because we\u2019re in Greece! Why would a staff in a Greek resort speak German?!\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>When seeing how amazed he was, Y/N could\u2019t help but chuckle as she interlocked their fingers, flashing him a cheeky grin. \u201cI may or may not have done a bit of research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, my wife\u2019s gonna be my little translator on this trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife only knows <i>\u2018good morning\u2019</i> and <i>'good night\u2019</i> so you\u2019re not so lucky, Mr. Styles,\u201d she said, tip-toeing to peck his lips, but he was quick to lock one arm around her waist to kiss her passionately. That kiss could\u2019ve turned into a full make out session if she hadn\u2019t come to her senses and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cCan you be horny later when we\u2019re alone?\u201d</p><p>Her pink cheeks made Harry snort in amusement. He ran his hand up and down her back to rest dangerously close to her bum, which looked extra good in this vintage dress, he must say. \u201cWe\u2019re married. People know we fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do, just <i>not</i> in the resort lobby after arriving only five minutes ago,\u201d she told him, rolling her eyes. </p><p>With his arm wrapped around her, they headed towards the front desk for the check-in procedures and finally received their keys. That moment was by far the happiest they\u2019d ever been since their wedding night. After all, they were on their romantic honeymoon, on a beautiful island in Greece, and they were gonna be there for an entire week, just the two of them. It almost seemed like nothing could go wrong.</p><p><i>Almost</i>.</p><p><i>\u201cHarold?!\u201d</i></p><p>When Harry heard that voice he thought he was hallucinating. But as the voice got louder and more annoying, causing all the other guests as well as the staff to stare at him. He knew it was real.</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d His wife mumbled, she was also rooted to her spot. \u201cDid you hear that or was it just me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God\u2026I heard it too\u2026\u201d He sucked in a breath, turning around slowly as she did the same. Of all the annoying people he\u2019d come across in his entire life up to this point, it just <i>had</i> to be his mortal enemy \u2014 <i>his cousin</i> <i>Mason.</i></p><p>Despite Harry\u2019s hostile glare, the older Styles was beaming. \u201cWhat a lovely coincidence! Are you two on honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here to ruin my life?\u201d</p><p>The question made Mason chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re still funny, Harold. <i>Still</i> funny. I\u2019m actually on a summer vacation with my baby girl. Oh, there she is, my flower!\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cSweet cheeks! My baby!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna throw up\u2026\u201d Y/N whispered to her husband, receiving a smirk from him.</p><p>Stephanie showed up, wearing the biggest hat that covered half of her face as she strutted towards the three of them in her yellow summer dress. She\u2019d left all of her heavy luggage to the poor resort staff, who nearly got hit in the head by her throwing her handbag at him.</p><p>\u201cThe other Styles!\u201d She giggled, finally taking off her hat to pull the other couple into a hug. If Harry hadn\u2019t pushed her away, who knew how long she would\u2019ve kept squeezing them? \u201cWe missed your wedding! I think your invitation got lost in the mail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBold of you to think we sent you one.\u201d</p><p>Y/N quickly nudged Harry as she chuckled nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Steph\u2026We also missed your wedding so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come to your second ones!\u201d</p><p>Stephanie and her husband both fell about laughing at her rude joke. The kind of looks Harry and Y/N exchanged at that moment couldn\u2019t be more obvious that they\u2019d rather set themselves on fire than continue this dumb conversation. They were just too nice (or at least Y/N was) to say <i>'fuck off\u2019</i> and walk away.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to our room now,\u201d Y/N said, holding Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cNice talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Harry! Bye Y/N!\u201d</p><p>Y/N heard Stephanie loud and clear but she didn\u2019t look back and just stride as fast as possible towards the lift.</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight at the bar, Harold!\u201d</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, responded to his cousin with a middle finger in the air, and once again Y/N had to tug at his sleeve to tell him to be polite.</p><p>\u201cSuch a funny kid,\u201d Mason told his wife with a grin, before heading to the front desk.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The newlyweds\u2019 first day on the island wasn\u2019t so bad, minus the encounter with the other annoying couple that they hated more than Mondays. They got to spend a lot of time together soaked in the sun and the golden sand, and <i>not</i> thinking about the responsibilities they had back in London. As busy as they were with their own jobs, they rarely had time to have fun like they used to back when they were students. Now was the one chance for them to try everything they hadn\u2019t done before.</p><p>\u201cI hope nearly fucking your husband on the beach while being drunk off your ass was on your bucket list.\u201d Harry laughed as he dragged his wife out of the lift, and struggled to get the room card from his pocket while she was clinging onto him like a koala.</p><p>Normally, he would stop her from drinking too much. He always knew she could barely handle alcohol, but since they were on vacation, he made it an exception and let her do whatever she wanted. As a result, she was wasted and he was exhausted from making sure she didn\u2019t cause any trouble. His wife was a fun drunk, but every time she drank too much, it was always hard work for him. He had to make sure she didn\u2019t walk straight into a lamppost, get hit by a car for dancing on the street, or take off her clothes in public because she thought they were alone.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she mumbled, shoving two fingers in his face as he opened the door. \u201c<i>Two</i> days into our marriage\u2026and you already don\u2019t want to have sex with me anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure if you didn\u2019t count those two orgasms earlier.\u201d Harry laughed quietly. He just loved having silly conversations with her while she was not in her right mind to make any sense. </p><p>With a bit of difficulty, he shut the door after they\u2019d got in, and somehow managed to put her down on their bed. That was when Y/N started giggling like a madwoman, watching her husband stand with both hands on his hips and a confused grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cHubby, come give me a kiss!\u201d She tried to open her eyes to look at him, but they were fighting to stay shut, so she just opened her arms and gave him a silly grin. Harry took off her shoes as well as his own, then fell down onto the bed right by her side. He propped himself up on his elbow, pressing his lips to her temple.</p><p>\u201cNo! A real kiss!\u201d Y/N pouted. She didn\u2019t wait for his reaction to grab him by the collar of his shirt and kiss him hard on the mouth. Harry was a bit shocked considering how shy Y/N was most of the time. Actually, she\u2019d gained much more confidence after that many years they\u2019d been together. But shyness was just her nature, and he loved that about her.</p><p>Only when she\u2019d had a couple drinks did she get this bold. This was certainly <i>not</i> the first time, but Harry didn\u2019t think he could ever grow used to it. Soon he was right between her legs, one hand supporting his own weight as the other held her by the hip. Her black dress rose up to reveal the black lace underwear he\u2019d got for her. He intended to make a cheeky comment about it, yet she was already unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re <i>really</i> drunk,\u201d he whispered against her lips, chuckling lowly as she groaned like a spoiled little girl who didn\u2019t get the pony she asked for.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not on the beach anymore,\u201d she reasoned, eyebrows furrowed at him and opened his shirt to get her hands on his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, baby. Greece really does make you horny, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> make me horny.\u201d</p><p>Harry was taken aback for the second time that night, not only by her confidence but also by her flipping them over to straddle him. He tried to speak, yet she covered his mouth with her own, pressing both hands on his chest, pushing him down.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shushed him immediately. Holding his gaze, she moved slowly downward, wasting no time to pull down his shorts and wrapped her hands around his pulsing member. A growl escaped his throat as he shuddered at the feeling of her hot breath against him. When she gave him a slight squeeze, his hips buckled up, urging her to give him more. He was leaking and desperate for her touch, definitely not in the position to call it quit at this point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you in the palm of my hand,\u201d she said in a sing-song voice. <i>\u201cLiterally.\u201d</i></p><p>The sound of her name escaped his pink lips in a breathy tone. When he saw the way her pupils dilate even in the dim moonlight from their balcony door, he knew he was fucked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a good girl.\u201d <i>Fuck</i>. \u201cLet me suck you off, please?\u201d <i>Fuck. Me.</i></p><p>Harry exhaled harshly, too out of his mind to even think straight as he stroked her hair. \u201cY-Yes\u2026yes, you are\u2026<i>Fuck</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>She nodded, finally giving him a few slow strokes. Harry\u2019s eyes squeezed shut in an instant as his entire face contorted. He was afraid this would end so quickly that her forgetting all about tonight might seem like a good thing. Just as he was about to ask her to go faster, a loud <i>thump!</i> caused Y/N to sit up straight, eyes just as wide as his. The bed in the room next door was violently banging against the wall, as the couple over there didn\u2019t make an effort to keep it down.</p><p><i>\u201cFuck yeah, baby! Fuck me! Fuck me hard!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is\u2026<i>that?</i>\u201d A look of terror flashed across Harry\u2019s face when he made eye-contact with a giggly Y/N. She had no idea what was going on, but everything was hilarious to her when she was drunk. As much as he wanted to ignore that horny couple to go back to his own business, he couldn\u2019t even <i>think</i> with all the noises those people were making. In a second, he sat up and tucked himself back inside his shorts, pecking Y/N\u2019s lips as he told her he would go talk to them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, hands on his shoulders. \u201cStay with me, Harry\u2026I need you.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s self-control unraveled when she moaned his name that way. Nodding fast, he attached their mouths once again as she cupped his cheeks and kissed him with everything she\u2019d got. He tried to focus on her, he <i>really</i> did, until he heard the name of the <i>last</i> person he wanted to think of when he was about to have sex with his wife.</p><p><i>\u201cMason! Yes, that\u2019s right baby!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cNo, no, non no!\u201d Harry cried out, pulling away immediately. Though Y/N wasn\u2019t sober enough to get disgusted by the other two, she still agreed to get off her husband and follow him outside. As he knocked on the room next door, she hugged him from behind and rested her head on his back. Drunk Y/N always got a bit clingy, and Harry loved it actually. If only he could pay attention to her and take care of her instead of having to deal with his fucked up cousin.</p><p>When he knocked a couple more times, it was Stephanie who came to open the door, wearing only her lingerie. Harry had to stare at the ceiling while silently thanking god that the woman wasn\u2019t naked.</p><p>\u201cOh, Harry and Y/N! What a surprise! We were just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we know. <i>Please</i> stop,\u201d he spoke fast, leaving Stephanie speechless. She parted her smudged red lips to say something, but then Mason showed up, unlike his wife, he was completely naked under his white bathrobe which wasn\u2019t even tied at the front.</p><p>Harry immediately covered Y/N\u2019s eyes, dashing his own back on Mason\u2019s face so he wouldn\u2019t have to look at <i>that thing</i> for another second. Y/N might\u2019ve seen it too because she was trying so hard to contain her laughter.</p><p>\u201cPut your dick away, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I forgot,\u201d said the older man who quickly tied the strings together to cover himself up.</p><p>Stephanie gave the other couple one last glance before telling Mason she\u2019d wait for him in bed. Harry really wished he could listen to those words without thinking about the thing he\u2019d heard earlier in his room. How was he gonna sleep tonight if <i>that</i> was what he might wake up to?</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he narrowed his eyes at Mason. It was clear he was losing his temper, but he was still trying to be as nice as he possibly could. Because treat people with kindness right?<i> Yeah, people, not Mason. Fuck Mason.</i></p><p>\u201cWait for me inside, love,\u201d Harry said to his wife, who pouted yet listened to him anyway.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long,\u201d she told him before retreating to their room. Harry watched the door close behind her as he heaved a sigh. This conversation wouldn\u2019t have been necessary if he could\u2019ve just punched the asshole. But on second thought, he shouldn\u2019t waste a good hit on someone like him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was this?\u201d Harry asked, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cI get that you always feel the need to prove that you\u2019re better than me, but to book the same fucking resort, <i>and</i> the room right next to mine just to piss me off is what only a psychopath would do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou self-centered prick.\u201d Mason scoffed, leaning against the door. \u201cYou really think everything I do is about you?\u201d</p><p>Harry lifted his eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t <i>think</i>. I <i>know </i>everything you do is because you cannot stand the fact that Y/N and I are happier than you and Steph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. The last thing I worry about is you being better than me at anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time you say that, make sure to keep your <i>tiny</i> friend covered.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t even bother to stay and see his cousin\u2019s reaction to the comment. He stormed back to his room, hoping Mason would get insecure enough to keep the noise down when they\u2014</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Harry asked, but there was not a single sound except for his wife\u2019s soft snoring as she was now sprawling across their bed. It\u2019d be a lie to say he was disappointed, but seeing her adorable sleeping face really made him happy again. In silence, he lied down by her side, trying not to cause too much movement and wake her up.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to say you love me tonight, drunkie.\u201d His eyelids fluttered from exhaustion as he watched Y/N smiling in her sleep. Even though he couldn\u2019t read her mind, he\u2019d like to think that it was him she was dreaming about. So while stroking her hair the way she liked, he mumbled to her what he never forgot to say every night before bed. \u201cYou\u2019re my entire world, and I really love you.\u201d </p><p>Then he drifted off gradually.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The next morning, as expected, Y/N barely remembered anything.</p><p>\u201cBeside me talking to a palm tree\u2026\u201d she cringed, trying to recollect the night before, but all that she could remember was asking Harry to dance with her on the beach. \u201cDid I do anything else embarrassing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to tear off my clothes and begged to suck me off,\u201d said Harry as he took a sip of his orange juice, flashing her a subtle smirk when her face reddened, certainly not because of the heat out here. What was better than having breakfast by the ocean, feeling the cool breezes on a hot summer day, <i>and</i> poking fun at your wife for the silly things she did when she was drunk? He was having the best morning.</p><p>\u201cI remember that\u2026\u201d She mumbled, stealing a glance at him while his eyes were glued on her.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything\u2026only a bit.\u201d</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow when she pouted at him. He knew she wanted him to change the subject, but he enjoyed teasing her too much to let her off that easily.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t this shy when you literally asked me to fuck you on the beach last night.\u201d He chuckled, making her blush even harder as she kicked his leg under the table.</p><p>\u201cThere are children around here! They might hear you!\u201d</p><p>Now that she mentioned, Harry looked around and noticed a family of four sitting right beside them. The parents were too caught up in their own conversation to hear what he was saying, and the child around four was singing while playing with her action figures. Harry\u2019s laughter died down soon, yet the smile lingered on his face when the little girl saw him looking and waved at him. He waved back, feeling his heart flutter somehow. </p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t see what was going on as she was texting this whole time. She had to give her mother updates on basically everything she\u2019d been doing (beside her getting drunk and them having sex every single chance they got), because to her mother apparently, she\u2019d stopped growing since the age of fourteen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Y/N flinched to meet her husband\u2019s eyes when she turned back to him. He was just smiling at her in silence with his chin resting on his knuckles. She couldn\u2019t figure out what that meant. \u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauty.\u201d His unexpected answer got her laughing.</p><p>\u201cSee? This is why I don\u2019t believe in your compliments anymore.\u201d She rolled her eyes and told him to eat since they had some sightseeing to do later. Harry didn\u2019t mind his breakfast getting cold though. His eyes stayed on Y/N, watching her slightly nodding her head to the song on the vintage radio at the bar. His lips curved to form a little grin. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell her exactly what was on his mind when the kid at the other table waved at him. They\u2019d had this talk, and both agreed to wait another year or two before making the big decision. Because let\u2019s be honest, now they couldn\u2019t spend much time with their cat let alone a human baby. But Harry guessed it wouldn\u2019t hurt to just imagine little versions of themselves running around their house. And he really looked forward to that day.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, somehow they managed to stay away from Mason and Stephanie and had the best time of their life exploring the island. Thus they assumed their second day here would continue to be this great. What they forgot was that, <i>every time</i> they drew a conclusion this early, they ended up with at least one disappointing surprise towards the end.</p><p>\u201cHarold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Harry muttered as he turned away from the bar and gave his cousin a death glare. \u201cDo I need to file a restraining order?\u201d</p><p>Normally Y/N would remind him to tone down his feelings of hatred, but after last night (Harry had filled her in on everything that she didn\u2019t remember) it was hard to continue being nice. She was just trying her best not to laugh at how offended both Mason and Stephanie seemed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to apologize actually. I hope we can forget what happened as we were all drunk anyway,\u201d Mason said, giving out his hand for Harry to shake. But instead of doing just that, Harry glanced at the hand, back to Mason\u2019s face. With a sarcastic smile, he straight off said, \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>, now leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Harold. You cannot blame me for what happened to your father\u2019s company.\u201d<br></p><p>Harry squinted his eyes as soon as he heard. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Mason and Stephanie exchanged looks as if they were also surprised that Harry had no clue about his father\u2019s decision. Quickly, Stephanie grabbed Y/N by the arm, pulling the perplexed young woman out of her chair.</p><p>\u201cCome swim with me, Y/N!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2026can\u2019t swim,\u201d Y/N muttered, turning to her husband for help, but he was too busy staring at his cousin in disbelief to notice her.</p><p>\u201cJust come with me, so they can talk,\u201d Stephanie insisted. She didn\u2019t even give Y/N time to say no and just dragged her out of the restaurant anyway. It was then that Harry finally got a grip on reality. He shifted in his chair, eyebrows furrowed as he asked Mason to explain everything.</p><p>\u201cDevlin\u2019s gonna sell Styles Corporation. I gave him that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Harry\u2019s mouth fell open. Mason, on the other hand, sat down and ordered a beer as he remained impassive. Harry completely understood that Mason had nothing to do with Styles Corporation, thus it was normal for him to not feel anything. What made Harry angry, was the fact that Mason had suggested Devlin to sell the brainchild he probably loved more than his real ones.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sacrificed a lot to build his own empire from scratch! You can\u2019t just convince him to sell it!\u201d Harry slammed his hand onto the counter, receiving a few questioning glances from the other people, yet he was too upset to care.</p><p>\u201cYou think my opinion alone could get your old man to sell the company?\u201d Mason snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s Devlin we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot run it forever, Harold. Your sister is a travel photographer, <i>you</i> were his only hope until you turned on him at the last minute. What choice does he have left?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s heart fell as he heard those words. He hadn\u2019t expected that news, especially for it to come from his least favorite person on the planet. Though he was still mad at Devlin for choosing the company over his own son, and not showing up at the wedding over saying sorry, he honestly felt bad for the fate of Styles Corporation. It obviously was a stab in the guts to hand everything you\u2019d built up from the ground up to strangers. But what could Harry do to change it? He couldn\u2019t leave his wife here, or convince her to leave her job and move to San Francisco. </p><p>With his head in his hand, Harry began to ponder, which was the last thing he should do now that he was supposed to be on a vacation. <i>Fuck everything</i>, he thought. Fuck Mason for telling him this, for being here, <i>and</i> for existing. He blamed it on Mason because it was easier this way. He didn\u2019t have to face the music, knowing it was his own fault.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N and Harry weren\u2019t strangers to bad luck, but <i>this </i>was a whole new level.</p><p>All she had wanted was a drama free honeymoon with the love of her life and to spend everyday under the sun or getting naked and tangling up in bed. Now here she was, taking Instagram photos for Stephanie by the resort pool, while Harry was probably being tortured by Mason boasting about things that nobody cared about.</p><p>\u201cShit, you\u2019re right. The lighting sucks,\u201d Stephanie mumbled in annoyance as she checked the photos on her phone.<br></p><p>Y/N really wanted to be frank and tell the girl only idiots would expect moonlight to look flattering on photos taken by an iPhone, but she thought it would be quite mean and decided to be subtly sarcastic instead.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should choose a better time when there\u2019s the sun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot stand too long in the sun, I get burnt easily,\u201d Stephanie chuckled, too busy staring at photos of herself to see that eye-roll Y/N had just given her.</p><p>\u201cI think I should get back to my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Stephanie took the girl\u2019s wrist before she could turn away, pulling her back. \u201cLook, since we\u2019re kind of like sisters now\u2014\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck me</i>, muttered the voice inside Y/N\u2019s head as she widened her eyes and faked a grin.</p><p>\u201cI just wanna be honest with you.\u201d Stephanie took a deep breath, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cWhy Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re kinda smart. You really wanna spend the rest of your life with someone like him?\u201d</p><p><i>Excuse me?</i></p><p>\u201cHarry is the smartest man I know.\u201d</p><p><i>And YOU shouldn\u2019t be judging him when you\u2019re the dumbest person I know.</i></p><p>\u201cIf he was so smart, he wouldn\u2019t have turned down an opportunity to be the future CEO of the Styles Corporation. Unlike Mason, he\u2019s a disappointment in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mason got everything from pure luck. Harry, on the other hand, has worked hard for the things that he loves. He\u2019s got a career and a bright future, and I\u2019m very proud of him.\u201d Y/N knew she shouldn\u2019t be fuming over the words of someone as shallow as Stephanie, yet she couldn\u2019t help but get all riled up when all of those insults were for her husband.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he gonna take care of you and buy you nice clothes with his salary now?\u201d Stephanie\u2019s argument made Y/N laugh, definitely <i>not</i> because it was funny.</p><p>\u201cI have my own job and I can buy my own clothes.\u201d She furrowed her brows, stabbing a finger at the blonde who was slightly surprised by the reaction she received. \u201c<i>You</i>, however, live off your husband because without him you are nothing. Face it, Steph, you\u2019re going nowhere with your non-existent model career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Stephanie gasped. It was funny how offended she got after having said all those mean things about Harry earlier.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you heard me.\u201d This time, Y/N wouldn\u2019t give this woman the satisfaction she wanted. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever talk shit about my husband again. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re threatening me?\u201d The part-time model scoffed as she flipped her hair. \u201cWhat are you gonna do? You think I\u2019m scared of a weak little girl who cannot swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014<i>AHHHHH!</i>\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cMom! That lady just pushed the other lady into the pool!\u201d</i></p><p>Harry flew right out of his chair after hearing what the little girl said to her mother. He rushed outside in a flash, worrying it might be Y/N and Stephanie for he knew his cousin\u2019s wife was crazy as fuck. So if anything happened to\u2014</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>Yes, it <i>was</i> Y/N and Stephanie. But his wife was standing by the pool, dry and safe, while the other girl was screaming and struggling violently in the water like a drowning cat.</p><p>\u201cYou crazy bitch! You fucking psychopath! Get me out of here! Help! Anyone?!\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cDrop the act! This is a kiddie pool!\u201d Y/N shouted at Stephanie as Harry gave his woman a smirk, looking shocked <i>and</i> proud at the same time. \u201cSay those things about my husband again, and I\u2019ll push you off a cliff!\u201d</p><p>Morally speaking, Harry <i>should</i> care about the fact that his wife had assaulted his cousin\u2019s wife, and all the other guests were judging them so hard right now. But all that he really cared about was how much seeing her like this turned him on. This was the first time he\u2019d got to witness the protective side of Y/N, <i>so fucking badass. </i>And he was certainly <i>not</i> disappointed at all.</p><p><i>Go wifey!</i></p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s okay! She\u2019s a lunatic!\u201d Stephanie screamed as she climbed out of the pool and Mason showed up with a towel to cover her up.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, mate?\u201d He snarled at Harry, pointing at Y/N. \u201cYour wife just threatened to push my wife off a cliff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please Mason, you two aren\u2019t saints.\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. He didn\u2019t know what those two expected, as if he hadn\u2019t thought of pushing one them off a cliff before.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey, let\u2019s go,\u201d said Y/N as she took her husband\u2019s hand and turned to walk away. It could\u2019ve ended there, with no one getting hurt (besides Stephanie who was soaked from head to toes), but just as expected, Mason never wanted to miss a chance to say the last words.</p><p>\u201cYour wife is bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, your wife is a\u2014\u201d Mason was cut off by a fist in the face that knocked him to the ground. While everyone else who\u2019d witnessed that punch was in utter shock, Harry had <i>never</i> felt better. He\u2019d wanted to do that for his whole life. </p><p>Before Mason could pick himself up and wipe the blood off his nose, Harry and Y/N had already fled the scene. The last thing they wanted was to get into trouble for causing disruption. At first, Y/N was really scared though it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d seen Harry hit someone. But as soon as they made it to the beach, she started squealing in joy.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing! I pushed her into the pool, and you punched him in the face! We\u2019re like the best couple ever!\u201d</p><p>The way she was all giggly and bouncing up and down like a child made Harry laugh so hard. He took her hand and pulled her back into his arms. Hers came wrapped around his waist like an instinct.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too happy for someone who just assaulted a woman,\u201d he said, stroking her cheeks to gain back a smile.</p><p>\u201cNow I know why Layla does things like this! She\u2019ll be so proud of me when I tell her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d Harry faked a frown. \u201cShould I be worried that you\u2019re turning into Layla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it makes you feel better, I only <i>Layla</i> for you.\u201d Her answer got him chuckling and shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna kill us both if she knows we\u2019re using her as a verb,\u201d he said, pressing a kiss to the tip of her nose. \u201cBut thank you, for defending me.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNo one.\u201d </i>Y/N narrowed her eyes as she emphasized those two words. \u201cNo one is allowed to make fun of my husband, beside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaaand Layla, because you know, I\u2019m afraid of her.\u201d</p><p>They held each other while laughing. It was nice for Harry to stop thinking about his father\u2019s company, and enjoying the presence of the woman he loved instead. They continued walking barefoot along the beach, listening to the lullaby of the waves, and breathing deeply the ocean carried air. It was romantic at first with the starry sky right above them. But all it took was one moment, when both of them stopped and just stared at each other, for their self-control to cave in at once.</p><p>The next thing they knew was them hiding in the shadow of a palm tree, she was pressed against the brick wall, with her legs wrapped around his waist, and her hands in his hair. His shorts were halfway down his ass and her panties were somewhere on the sand. She would definitely not put them back on after they were done. </p><p>\u201cWhat did I do to deserve you?\u201d Harry tried not to be rough, but he making sure every thrust was worthwhile. He dragged his lips down her jawline as she filled his ears with her angelic whimpers that he could never get tired of. </p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he said, gripping her ass to move her hips in sync with his own.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d She let a soft gasp escape when he hit just the right spot that caused her eyes to roll upward, and the sound of his name to pour out from her wet lips. She was too lost in the moment to care if anyone heard her. There was not a single soul around anyway, so Harry didn\u2019t bother to silence his wife, not when he loved how vocal she was just for him.</p><p>\u201cShit love\u2026I\u2026\u201d He thrust faster, face contorted from pleasure. \u201cGonna come\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFill me.\u201d Those breathless words and her grinding down on him to get him deeper was all it took for Harry to explode, groaning into her mouth as he felt her walls squeezing around him. Her eyes fell shut, her head tossed back, and now she couldn\u2019t stop whimpering meaningless words, the only thing that made sense was his name.</p><p>\u201cWe finally had sex on the beach, you happy?\u201d He jokingly asked while still catching his breath, his hooded eyes stared right into hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dick,\u201d she said, smiling at the way his eyes sparkled in the dark like those stars right above them. That playful insult only made him chortle. He brought his mouth back on hers to kiss her tenderly.</p><p>\u201cAnd also your husband, so you\u2019re stuck with this dick for the rest of your life,\u201d he spoke against her lips, causing her to dissolve into laughter. Harry temporarily forgot about the fate of his father\u2019s company, and the stress he felt thinking he was the reason for it. At this moment, there were only them and them alone, though he knew it couldn\u2019t be them forever. When this week was over they would have to return to their busy lives. So now he must hold her closer, not wanting another second to go to waste.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Did you know that Niall almost lost Treasure when he took her to the mall with him?\u201d Y/N said the second she showed up at their bedroom door with the cat in her arms. Harry had just finished getting dressed for work. He turned away from the mirror and flashed his wife a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cDid Treasure tell you that?\u201d</p><p>She snorted, rolling her eyes and put the cat down on their bed to come fix his collar. \u201cLayla told me\u2026We should let Ben and Nam watch Treasure next time we\u2019re away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He nodded. It was then that she finally looked up and caught the way he was staring at her. Neither of them said a word. After many years under the same roof, they didn\u2019t have to speak to know what was on the other person\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She questioned, placing both hands on his shoulders. \u201cI mean\u2026if you wanna help your dad keep the company\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had this talk, love,\u201d he cut her off, seemingly displeased. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>When he kissed her on the cheek and attempted to go, she squeezed his arms to force his eyes back on her. She\u2019d thought a lot about Stephanie\u2019s words, and maybe Stephanie was not entirely wrong. Of course she didn\u2019t want anything more from Harry, for he\u2019d always been more than enough. Despite so she felt awful that he had to give up on such a great opportunity for her. If he\u2019d never met her, maybe he would\u2019ve been rich and much more successful than he was now. He would\u2019ve been his own boss and driving nice cars and probably engaged to someone from a rich family. He could\u2019ve had it all. The least she could do now as his wife was encourage him to do what was best for him.</p><p>\u201cLove, just accept the job, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot leave you here and move to San Francisco.\u201d He chuckled, yet she seemed so serious and he knew it wasn\u2019t time to joke around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you and\u2026and find a new job there\u2026\u201d</p><p>Harry was paralyzed for a long moment when he heard those words. His wife, who\u2019d loved her job more than anything, was willing to drop everything just so he could be the CEO his father expected him to be. And he knew it was all because she loved him and she blamed herself for what she thought he\u2019d lost. The truth, however, was that he never needed anything more than her. </p><p>Harry pulled Y/N into his arms, one hand at the back of her head as he whispered into her ear, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about this anymore, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to work today?\u201d He changed the subject, knowing how easy it was for her to get distracted.</p><p>\u201cGot a day off.\u201d Y/N pressed her lips into a smile as she picked up their cat and followed her husband to the front door. Since Harry was extremely forgetful, they always had to do the <i>'checklist\u2019</i> together every morning before leaving home.</p><p>\u201cUmbrella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready in my bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar key?\u201d</p><p>Harry flinched when he stuck his hand into his coat pocket and couldn\u2019t find the key. The frantic look on his face made his wife laugh as she handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou left it by the sink\u2026again,\u201d she said, resulting in a smile of relief on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best. Love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d She called out when he was about to leave. \u201cForgetting something else?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look of confused, until she lifted her face and pointed to her lips, eyes closed. With a smile, he didn\u2019t hesitate to walk back and kiss her goodbye.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you can go,\u201d she said, patting his cheek. \u201cHave a great da\u2014\u201d</p><p>Y/N could barely finish her sentence when all of a sudden the door opposite from theirs creaked open. The couple nearly screamed as they saw who it was.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?!\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes expanded to the point they could just fall out. \u201cWhy are <i>you</i> here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my new place,\u201d said Mason, who looked just as pissed off. In all honesty, Y/N and Harry thought this was better than having to deal with his pretentious <i>'kindness\u2019.</i></p><p>\u201cOkay, you knew we lived here, asshole,\u201d Harry snarled at him. \u201cYou expect us to believe this is another coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou actually think we remembered your address and your flat number so we could get this flat because we\u2019re so obsessed with you?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nodded fast. \u201cYeah, Mason, that\u2019s exactly what we think.\u201d</p><p>Harry threw his hands in the air, face screwed up as he turned to his wife. \u201cWhat kind of shitty alternate universe is this?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you complaining? I\u2019m the one with crazy neighbors here.\u201d</p><p>Harry turned a deaf ear to his cousin\u2019s insult. He would love to stay and start another fight, but he didn\u2019t want this asshole to be the reason he was late for work. He said goodbye to his wife, yet before leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to give Mason the finger and walked off without a second look back.</p><p>Y/N watched him go with heart eyes a wide smile on her face, while Mason could not look anymore irritated. That was when Stephanie showed up at the door, holding a yellow cat. The woman looked as shocked as her husband to see Y/N standing there. It was Treasure who broke the hostile silence. She meowed loudly, probably excited to see her new cat neighbor. But Stephanie didn\u2019t seem so fond of the idea of their two cats being friends. Giving Y/N a look of disgust, she told her pet, \u201c<i>Tiger</i>, stop looking at that dirty creature.

Y/N tugged at his arm, covering her mouth so she wouldn&rsquo;t laugh too hard and draw even more attention to them.</p><p>&ldquo;You just said &rsquo;<i>thank you very much</i>&rsquo; in German, H!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t what he said in German?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He said &rsquo;<i>welcome to Greece</i>&rsquo; in Greek because we&rsquo;re in Greece! Why would a staff in a Greek resort speak German?!&rdquo;</p><p>When seeing how amazed he was, Y/N could&rsquo;t help but chuckle as she interlocked their fingers, flashing him a cheeky grin. &ldquo;I may or may not have done a bit of research.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, my wife&rsquo;s gonna be my little translator on this trip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your wife only knows <i>&lsquo;good morning&rsquo;</i> and <i>'good night&rsquo;</i> so you&rsquo;re not so lucky, Mr. Styles,&rdquo; she said, tip-toeing to peck his lips, but he was quick to lock one arm around her waist to kiss her passionately. That kiss could&rsquo;ve turned into a full make out session if she hadn&rsquo;t come to her senses and pushed him away.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you be horny later when we&rsquo;re alone?&rdquo;</p><p>Her pink cheeks made Harry snort in amusement. He ran his hand up and down her back to rest dangerously close to her bum, which looked extra good in this vintage dress, he must say. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re married. People know we fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We do, just <i>not</i> in the resort lobby after arriving only five minutes ago,&rdquo; she told him, rolling her eyes. </p><p>With his arm wrapped around her, they headed towards the front desk for the check-in procedures and finally received their keys. That moment was by far the happiest they&rsquo;d ever been since their wedding night. After all, they were on their romantic honeymoon, on a beautiful island in Greece, and they were gonna be there for an entire week, just the two of them. It almost seemed like nothing could go wrong.</p><p><i>Almost</i>.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Harold?!&rdquo;</i></p><p>When Harry heard that voice he thought he was hallucinating. But as the voice got louder and more annoying, causing all the other guests as well as the staff to stare at him. He knew it was real.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey?&rdquo; His wife mumbled, she was also rooted to her spot. &ldquo;Did you hear that or was it just me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh God&hellip;I heard it too&hellip;&rdquo; He sucked in a breath, turning around slowly as she did the same. Of all the annoying people he&rsquo;d come across in his entire life up to this point, it just <i>had</i> to be his mortal enemy &mdash; <i>his cousin</i> <i>Mason.</i></p><p>Despite Harry&rsquo;s hostile glare, the older Styles was beaming. &ldquo;What a lovely coincidence! Are you two on honeymoon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you here to ruin my life?&rdquo;</p><p>The question made Mason chuckle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still funny, Harold. <i>Still</i> funny. I&rsquo;m actually on a summer vacation with my baby girl. Oh, there she is, my flower!&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sweet cheeks! My baby!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna throw up&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N whispered to her husband, receiving a smirk from him.</p><p>Stephanie showed up, wearing the biggest hat that covered half of her face as she strutted towards the three of them in her yellow summer dress. She&rsquo;d left all of her heavy luggage to the poor resort staff, who nearly got hit in the head by her throwing her handbag at him.</p><p>&ldquo;The other Styles!&rdquo; She giggled, finally taking off her hat to pull the other couple into a hug. If Harry hadn&rsquo;t pushed her away, who knew how long she would&rsquo;ve kept squeezing them? &ldquo;We missed your wedding! I think your invitation got lost in the mail!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bold of you to think we sent you one.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N quickly nudged Harry as she chuckled nervously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, Steph&hellip;We also missed your wedding so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to your second ones!&rdquo;</p><p>Stephanie and her husband both fell about laughing at her rude joke. The kind of looks Harry and Y/N exchanged at that moment couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious that they&rsquo;d rather set themselves on fire than continue this dumb conversation. They were just too nice (or at least Y/N was) to say <i>'fuck off&rsquo;</i> and walk away.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to our room now,&rdquo; Y/N said, holding Harry&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Nice talking to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Harry! Bye Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N heard Stephanie loud and clear but she didn&rsquo;t look back and just stride as fast as possible towards the lift.</p><p>&ldquo;See you tonight at the bar, Harold!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry, on the other hand, responded to his cousin with a middle finger in the air, and once again Y/N had to tug at his sleeve to tell him to be polite.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a funny kid,&rdquo; Mason told his wife with a grin, before heading to the front desk.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The newlyweds&rsquo; first day on the island wasn&rsquo;t so bad, minus the encounter with the other annoying couple that they hated more than Mondays. They got to spend a lot of time together soaked in the sun and the golden sand, and <i>not</i> thinking about the responsibilities they had back in London. As busy as they were with their own jobs, they rarely had time to have fun like they used to back when they were students. Now was the one chance for them to try everything they hadn&rsquo;t done before.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope nearly fucking your husband on the beach while being drunk off your ass was on your bucket list.&rdquo; Harry laughed as he dragged his wife out of the lift, and struggled to get the room card from his pocket while she was clinging onto him like a koala.</p><p>Normally, he would stop her from drinking too much. He always knew she could barely handle alcohol, but since they were on vacation, he made it an exception and let her do whatever she wanted. As a result, she was wasted and he was exhausted from making sure she didn&rsquo;t cause any trouble. His wife was a fun drunk, but every time she drank too much, it was always hard work for him. He had to make sure she didn&rsquo;t walk straight into a lamppost, get hit by a car for dancing on the street, or take off her clothes in public because she thought they were alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; she mumbled, shoving two fingers in his face as he opened the door. &ldquo;<i>Two</i> days into our marriage&hellip;and you already don&rsquo;t want to have sex with me anymore!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure if you didn&rsquo;t count those two orgasms earlier.&rdquo; Harry laughed quietly. He just loved having silly conversations with her while she was not in her right mind to make any sense. </p><p>With a bit of difficulty, he shut the door after they&rsquo;d got in, and somehow managed to put her down on their bed. That was when Y/N started giggling like a madwoman, watching her husband stand with both hands on his hips and a confused grin on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hubby, come give me a kiss!&rdquo; She tried to open her eyes to look at him, but they were fighting to stay shut, so she just opened her arms and gave him a silly grin. Harry took off her shoes as well as his own, then fell down onto the bed right by her side. He propped himself up on his elbow, pressing his lips to her temple.</p><p>&ldquo;No! A real kiss!&rdquo; Y/N pouted. She didn&rsquo;t wait for his reaction to grab him by the collar of his shirt and kiss him hard on the mouth. Harry was a bit shocked considering how shy Y/N was most of the time. Actually, she&rsquo;d gained much more confidence after that many years they&rsquo;d been together. But shyness was just her nature, and he loved that about her.</p><p>Only when she&rsquo;d had a couple drinks did she get this bold. This was certainly <i>not</i> the first time, but Harry didn&rsquo;t think he could ever grow used to it. Soon he was right between her legs, one hand supporting his own weight as the other held her by the hip. Her black dress rose up to reveal the black lace underwear he&rsquo;d got for her. He intended to make a cheeky comment about it, yet she was already unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, you&rsquo;re <i>really</i> drunk,&rdquo; he whispered against her lips, chuckling lowly as she groaned like a spoiled little girl who didn&rsquo;t get the pony she asked for.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not on the beach anymore,&rdquo; she reasoned, eyebrows furrowed at him and opened his shirt to get her hands on his bare chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ, baby. Greece really does make you horny, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> make me horny.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was taken aback for the second time that night, not only by her confidence but also by her flipping them over to straddle him. He tried to speak, yet she covered his mouth with her own, pressing both hands on his chest, pushing him down.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>She shushed him immediately. Holding his gaze, she moved slowly downward, wasting no time to pull down his shorts and wrapped her hands around his pulsing member. A growl escaped his throat as he shuddered at the feeling of her hot breath against him. When she gave him a slight squeeze, his hips buckled up, urging her to give him more. He was leaking and desperate for her touch, definitely not in the position to call it quit at this point.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you in the palm of my hand,&rdquo; she said in a sing-song voice. <i>&ldquo;Literally.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The sound of her name escaped his pink lips in a breathy tone. When he saw the way her pupils dilate even in the dim moonlight from their balcony door, he knew he was fucked.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a good girl.&rdquo; <i>Fuck</i>. &ldquo;Let me suck you off, please?&rdquo; <i>Fuck. Me.</i></p><p>Harry exhaled harshly, too out of his mind to even think straight as he stroked her hair. &ldquo;Y-Yes&hellip;yes, you are&hellip;<i>Fuck</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded, finally giving him a few slow strokes. Harry&rsquo;s eyes squeezed shut in an instant as his entire face contorted. He was afraid this would end so quickly that her forgetting all about tonight might seem like a good thing. Just as he was about to ask her to go faster, a loud <i>thump!</i> caused Y/N to sit up straight, eyes just as wide as his. The bed in the room next door was violently banging against the wall, as the couple over there didn&rsquo;t make an effort to keep it down.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck yeah, baby! Fuck me! Fuck me hard!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck is&hellip;<i>that?</i>&rdquo; A look of terror flashed across Harry&rsquo;s face when he made eye-contact with a giggly Y/N. She had no idea what was going on, but everything was hilarious to her when she was drunk. As much as he wanted to ignore that horny couple to go back to his own business, he couldn&rsquo;t even <i>think</i> with all the noises those people were making. In a second, he sat up and tucked himself back inside his shorts, pecking Y/N&rsquo;s lips as he told her he would go talk to them.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She shook her head, hands on his shoulders. &ldquo;Stay with me, Harry&hellip;I need you.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s self-control unraveled when she moaned his name that way. Nodding fast, he attached their mouths once again as she cupped his cheeks and kissed him with everything she&rsquo;d got. He tried to focus on her, he <i>really</i> did, until he heard the name of the <i>last</i> person he wanted to think of when he was about to have sex with his wife.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Mason! Yes, that&rsquo;s right baby!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;No, no, non no!&rdquo; Harry cried out, pulling away immediately. Though Y/N wasn&rsquo;t sober enough to get disgusted by the other two, she still agreed to get off her husband and follow him outside. As he knocked on the room next door, she hugged him from behind and rested her head on his back. Drunk Y/N always got a bit clingy, and Harry loved it actually. If only he could pay attention to her and take care of her instead of having to deal with his fucked up cousin.</p><p>When he knocked a couple more times, it was Stephanie who came to open the door, wearing only her lingerie. Harry had to stare at the ceiling while silently thanking god that the woman wasn&rsquo;t naked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry and Y/N! What a surprise! We were just&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we know. <i>Please</i> stop,&rdquo; he spoke fast, leaving Stephanie speechless. She parted her smudged red lips to say something, but then Mason showed up, unlike his wife, he was completely naked under his white bathrobe which wasn&rsquo;t even tied at the front.</p><p>Harry immediately covered Y/N&rsquo;s eyes, dashing his own back on Mason&rsquo;s face so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to look at <i>that thing</i> for another second. Y/N might&rsquo;ve seen it too because she was trying so hard to contain her laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Put your dick away, for fuck&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I forgot,&rdquo; said the older man who quickly tied the strings together to cover himself up.</p><p>Stephanie gave the other couple one last glance before telling Mason she&rsquo;d wait for him in bed. Harry really wished he could listen to those words without thinking about the thing he&rsquo;d heard earlier in his room. How was he gonna sleep tonight if <i>that</i> was what he might wake up to?</p><p>&ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo; he narrowed his eyes at Mason. It was clear he was losing his temper, but he was still trying to be as nice as he possibly could. Because treat people with kindness right?<i> Yeah, people, not Mason. Fuck Mason.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait for me inside, love,&rdquo; Harry said to his wife, who pouted yet listened to him anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take too long,&rdquo; she told him before retreating to their room. Harry watched the door close behind her as he heaved a sigh. This conversation wouldn&rsquo;t have been necessary if he could&rsquo;ve just punched the asshole. But on second thought, he shouldn&rsquo;t waste a good hit on someone like him.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck was this?&rdquo; Harry asked, throwing his hands in the air. &ldquo;I get that you always feel the need to prove that you&rsquo;re better than me, but to book the same fucking resort, <i>and</i> the room right next to mine just to piss me off is what only a psychopath would do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You self-centered prick.&rdquo; Mason scoffed, leaning against the door. &ldquo;You really think everything I do is about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry lifted his eyebrow. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>think</i>. I <i>know </i>everything you do is because you cannot stand the fact that Y/N and I are happier than you and Steph.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please. The last thing I worry about is you being better than me at anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The next time you say that, make sure to keep your <i>tiny</i> friend covered.&rdquo; Harry didn&rsquo;t even bother to stay and see his cousin&rsquo;s reaction to the comment. He stormed back to his room, hoping Mason would get insecure enough to keep the noise down when they&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Harry asked, but there was not a single sound except for his wife&rsquo;s soft snoring as she was now sprawling across their bed. It&rsquo;d be a lie to say he was disappointed, but seeing her adorable sleeping face really made him happy again. In silence, he lied down by her side, trying not to cause too much movement and wake her up.</p><p>&ldquo;You forgot to say you love me tonight, drunkie.&rdquo; His eyelids fluttered from exhaustion as he watched Y/N smiling in her sleep. Even though he couldn&rsquo;t read her mind, he&rsquo;d like to think that it was him she was dreaming about. So while stroking her hair the way she liked, he mumbled to her what he never forgot to say every night before bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my entire world, and I really love you.&rdquo; </p><p>Then he drifted off gradually.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The next morning, as expected, Y/N barely remembered anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Beside me talking to a palm tree&hellip;&rdquo; she cringed, trying to recollect the night before, but all that she could remember was asking Harry to dance with her on the beach. &ldquo;Did I do anything else embarrassing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You tried to tear off my clothes and begged to suck me off,&rdquo; said Harry as he took a sip of his orange juice, flashing her a subtle smirk when her face reddened, certainly not because of the heat out here. What was better than having breakfast by the ocean, feeling the cool breezes on a hot summer day, <i>and</i> poking fun at your wife for the silly things she did when she was drunk? He was having the best morning.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember that&hellip;&rdquo; She mumbled, stealing a glance at him while his eyes were glued on her.</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not everything&hellip;only a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow when she pouted at him. He knew she wanted him to change the subject, but he enjoyed teasing her too much to let her off that easily.</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t this shy when you literally asked me to fuck you on the beach last night.&rdquo; He chuckled, making her blush even harder as she kicked his leg under the table.</p><p>&ldquo;There are children around here! They might hear you!&rdquo;</p><p>Now that she mentioned, Harry looked around and noticed a family of four sitting right beside them. The parents were too caught up in their own conversation to hear what he was saying, and the child around four was singing while playing with her action figures. Harry&rsquo;s laughter died down soon, yet the smile lingered on his face when the little girl saw him looking and waved at him. He waved back, feeling his heart flutter somehow. </p><p>Y/N didn&rsquo;t see what was going on as she was texting this whole time. She had to give her mother updates on basically everything she&rsquo;d been doing (beside her getting drunk and them having sex every single chance they got), because to her mother apparently, she&rsquo;d stopped growing since the age of fourteen.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Y/N flinched to meet her husband&rsquo;s eyes when she turned back to him. He was just smiling at her in silence with his chin resting on his knuckles. She couldn&rsquo;t figure out what that meant. &ldquo;Is there something on my face?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beauty.&rdquo; His unexpected answer got her laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;See? This is why I don&rsquo;t believe in your compliments anymore.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes and told him to eat since they had some sightseeing to do later. Harry didn&rsquo;t mind his breakfast getting cold though. His eyes stayed on Y/N, watching her slightly nodding her head to the song on the vintage radio at the bar. His lips curved to form a little grin. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t tell her exactly what was on his mind when the kid at the other table waved at him. They&rsquo;d had this talk, and both agreed to wait another year or two before making the big decision. Because let&rsquo;s be honest, now they couldn&rsquo;t spend much time with their cat let alone a human baby. But Harry guessed it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to just imagine little versions of themselves running around their house. And he really looked forward to that day.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, somehow they managed to stay away from Mason and Stephanie and had the best time of their life exploring the island. Thus they assumed their second day here would continue to be this great. What they forgot was that, <i>every time</i> they drew a conclusion this early, they ended up with at least one disappointing surprise towards the end.</p><p>&ldquo;Harold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; Harry muttered as he turned away from the bar and gave his cousin a death glare. &ldquo;Do I need to file a restraining order?&rdquo;</p><p>Normally Y/N would remind him to tone down his feelings of hatred, but after last night (Harry had filled her in on everything that she didn&rsquo;t remember) it was hard to continue being nice. She was just trying her best not to laugh at how offended both Mason and Stephanie seemed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to apologize actually. I hope we can forget what happened as we were all drunk anyway,&rdquo; Mason said, giving out his hand for Harry to shake. But instead of doing just that, Harry glanced at the hand, back to Mason&rsquo;s face. With a sarcastic smile, he straight off said, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>, now leave us alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Harold. You cannot blame me for what happened to your father&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Harry squinted his eyes as soon as he heard. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>Mason and Stephanie exchanged looks as if they were also surprised that Harry had no clue about his father&rsquo;s decision. Quickly, Stephanie grabbed Y/N by the arm, pulling the perplexed young woman out of her chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Come swim with me, Y/N!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I&hellip;can&rsquo;t swim,&rdquo; Y/N muttered, turning to her husband for help, but he was too busy staring at his cousin in disbelief to notice her.</p><p>&ldquo;Just come with me, so they can talk,&rdquo; Stephanie insisted. She didn&rsquo;t even give Y/N time to say no and just dragged her out of the restaurant anyway. It was then that Harry finally got a grip on reality. He shifted in his chair, eyebrows furrowed as he asked Mason to explain everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Devlin&rsquo;s gonna sell Styles Corporation. I gave him that idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s mouth fell open. Mason, on the other hand, sat down and ordered a beer as he remained impassive. Harry completely understood that Mason had nothing to do with Styles Corporation, thus it was normal for him to not feel anything. What made Harry angry, was the fact that Mason had suggested Devlin to sell the brainchild he probably loved more than his real ones.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sacrificed a lot to build his own empire from scratch! You can&rsquo;t just convince him to sell it!&rdquo; Harry slammed his hand onto the counter, receiving a few questioning glances from the other people, yet he was too upset to care.</p><p>&ldquo;You think my opinion alone could get your old man to sell the company?&rdquo; Mason snorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Devlin we&rsquo;re talking about here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He cannot run it forever, Harold. Your sister is a travel photographer, <i>you</i> were his only hope until you turned on him at the last minute. What choice does he have left?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s heart fell as he heard those words. He hadn&rsquo;t expected that news, especially for it to come from his least favorite person on the planet. Though he was still mad at Devlin for choosing the company over his own son, and not showing up at the wedding over saying sorry, he honestly felt bad for the fate of Styles Corporation. It obviously was a stab in the guts to hand everything you&rsquo;d built up from the ground up to strangers. But what could Harry do to change it? He couldn&rsquo;t leave his wife here, or convince her to leave her job and move to San Francisco. </p><p>With his head in his hand, Harry began to ponder, which was the last thing he should do now that he was supposed to be on a vacation. <i>Fuck everything</i>, he thought. Fuck Mason for telling him this, for being here, <i>and</i> for existing. He blamed it on Mason because it was easier this way. He didn&rsquo;t have to face the music, knowing it was his own fault.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Y/N and Harry weren&rsquo;t strangers to bad luck, but <i>this </i>was a whole new level.</p><p>All she had wanted was a drama free honeymoon with the love of her life and to spend everyday under the sun or getting naked and tangling up in bed. Now here she was, taking Instagram photos for Stephanie by the resort pool, while Harry was probably being tortured by Mason boasting about things that nobody cared about.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, you&rsquo;re right. The lighting sucks,&rdquo; Stephanie mumbled in annoyance as she checked the photos on her phone.<br /></p><p>Y/N really wanted to be frank and tell the girl only idiots would expect moonlight to look flattering on photos taken by an iPhone, but she thought it would be quite mean and decided to be subtly sarcastic instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should choose a better time when there&rsquo;s the sun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot stand too long in the sun, I get burnt easily,&rdquo; Stephanie chuckled, too busy staring at photos of herself to see that eye-roll Y/N had just given her.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I should get back to my husband.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Stephanie took the girl&rsquo;s wrist before she could turn away, pulling her back. &ldquo;Look, since we&rsquo;re kind of like sisters now&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Fuck me</i>, muttered the voice inside Y/N&rsquo;s head as she widened her eyes and faked a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;I just wanna be honest with you.&rdquo; Stephanie took a deep breath, lifting an eyebrow. &ldquo;Why Harry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re kinda smart. You really wanna spend the rest of your life with someone like him?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Excuse me?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Harry is the smartest man I know.&rdquo;</p><p><i>And YOU shouldn&rsquo;t be judging him when you&rsquo;re the dumbest person I know.</i></p><p>&ldquo;If he was so smart, he wouldn&rsquo;t have turned down an opportunity to be the future CEO of the Styles Corporation. Unlike Mason, he&rsquo;s a disappointment in the family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Mason got everything from pure luck. Harry, on the other hand, has worked hard for the things that he loves. He&rsquo;s got a career and a bright future, and I&rsquo;m very proud of him.&rdquo; Y/N knew she shouldn&rsquo;t be fuming over the words of someone as shallow as Stephanie, yet she couldn&rsquo;t help but get all riled up when all of those insults were for her husband.</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s he gonna take care of you and buy you nice clothes with his salary now?&rdquo; Stephanie&rsquo;s argument made Y/N laugh, definitely <i>not</i> because it was funny.</p><p>&ldquo;I have my own job and I can buy my own clothes.&rdquo; She furrowed her brows, stabbing a finger at the blonde who was slightly surprised by the reaction she received. &ldquo;<i>You</i>, however, live off your husband because without him you are nothing. Face it, Steph, you&rsquo;re going nowhere with your non-existent model career.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Stephanie gasped. It was funny how offended she got after having said all those mean things about Harry earlier.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you heard me.&rdquo; This time, Y/N wouldn&rsquo;t give this woman the satisfaction she wanted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever talk shit about my husband again. Are we clear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re threatening me?&rdquo; The part-time model scoffed as she flipped her hair. &ldquo;What are you gonna do? You think I&rsquo;m scared of a weak little girl who cannot swim?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you&mdash;<i>AHHHHH!</i>&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Mom! That lady just pushed the other lady into the pool!&rdquo;</i></p><p>Harry flew right out of his chair after hearing what the little girl said to her mother. He rushed outside in a flash, worrying it might be Y/N and Stephanie for he knew his cousin&rsquo;s wife was crazy as fuck. So if anything happened to&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey?&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, it <i>was</i> Y/N and Stephanie. But his wife was standing by the pool, dry and safe, while the other girl was screaming and struggling violently in the water like a drowning cat.</p><p>&ldquo;You crazy bitch! You fucking psychopath! Get me out of here! Help! Anyone?!&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Drop the act! This is a kiddie pool!&rdquo; Y/N shouted at Stephanie as Harry gave his woman a smirk, looking shocked <i>and</i> proud at the same time. &ldquo;Say those things about my husband again, and I&rsquo;ll push you off a cliff!&rdquo;</p><p>Morally speaking, Harry <i>should</i> care about the fact that his wife had assaulted his cousin&rsquo;s wife, and all the other guests were judging them so hard right now. But all that he really cared about was how much seeing her like this turned him on. This was the first time he&rsquo;d got to witness the protective side of Y/N, <i>so fucking badass. </i>And he was certainly <i>not</i> disappointed at all.</p><p><i>Go wifey!</i></p><p>&ldquo;You okay, baby?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fin&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s okay! She&rsquo;s a lunatic!&rdquo; Stephanie screamed as she climbed out of the pool and Mason showed up with a towel to cover her up.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck, mate?&rdquo; He snarled at Harry, pointing at Y/N. &ldquo;Your wife just threatened to push my wife off a cliff!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please Mason, you two aren&rsquo;t saints.&rdquo; Harry rolled his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t know what those two expected, as if he hadn&rsquo;t thought of pushing one them off a cliff before.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, honey, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Y/N as she took her husband&rsquo;s hand and turned to walk away. It could&rsquo;ve ended there, with no one getting hurt (besides Stephanie who was soaked from head to toes), but just as expected, Mason never wanted to miss a chance to say the last words.</p><p>&ldquo;Your wife is bitch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said, your wife is a&mdash;&rdquo; Mason was cut off by a fist in the face that knocked him to the ground. While everyone else who&rsquo;d witnessed that punch was in utter shock, Harry had <i>never</i> felt better. He&rsquo;d wanted to do that for his whole life. </p><p>Before Mason could pick himself up and wipe the blood off his nose, Harry and Y/N had already fled the scene. The last thing they wanted was to get into trouble for causing disruption. At first, Y/N was really scared though it wasn&rsquo;t the first time she&rsquo;d seen Harry hit someone. But as soon as they made it to the beach, she started squealing in joy.</p><p>&ldquo;That was amazing! I pushed her into the pool, and you punched him in the face! We&rsquo;re like the best couple ever!&rdquo;</p><p>The way she was all giggly and bouncing up and down like a child made Harry laugh so hard. He took her hand and pulled her back into his arms. Hers came wrapped around his waist like an instinct.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too happy for someone who just assaulted a woman,&rdquo; he said, stroking her cheeks to gain back a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Now I know why Layla does things like this! She&rsquo;ll be so proud of me when I tell her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo; Harry faked a frown. &ldquo;Should I be worried that you&rsquo;re turning into Layla?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if it makes you feel better, I only <i>Layla</i> for you.&rdquo; Her answer got him chuckling and shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna kill us both if she knows we&rsquo;re using her as a verb,&rdquo; he said, pressing a kiss to the tip of her nose. &ldquo;But thank you, for defending me.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo; </i>Y/N narrowed her eyes as she emphasized those two words. &ldquo;No one is allowed to make fun of my husband, beside me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aww.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aaaand Layla, because you know, I&rsquo;m afraid of her.&rdquo;</p><p>They held each other while laughing. It was nice for Harry to stop thinking about his father&rsquo;s company, and enjoying the presence of the woman he loved instead. They continued walking barefoot along the beach, listening to the lullaby of the waves, and breathing deeply the ocean carried air. It was romantic at first with the starry sky right above them. But all it took was one moment, when both of them stopped and just stared at each other, for their self-control to cave in at once.</p><p>The next thing they knew was them hiding in the shadow of a palm tree, she was pressed against the brick wall, with her legs wrapped around his waist, and her hands in his hair. His shorts were halfway down his ass and her panties were somewhere on the sand. She would definitely not put them back on after they were done. </p><p>&ldquo;What did I do to deserve you?&rdquo; Harry tried not to be rough, but he making sure every thrust was worthwhile. He dragged his lips down her jawline as she filled his ears with her angelic whimpers that he could never get tired of. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; he said, gripping her ass to move her hips in sync with his own.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; She let a soft gasp escape when he hit just the right spot that caused her eyes to roll upward, and the sound of his name to pour out from her wet lips. She was too lost in the moment to care if anyone heard her. There was not a single soul around anyway, so Harry didn&rsquo;t bother to silence his wife, not when he loved how vocal she was just for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit love&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo; He thrust faster, face contorted from pleasure. &ldquo;Gonna come&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fill me.&rdquo; Those breathless words and her grinding down on him to get him deeper was all it took for Harry to explode, groaning into her mouth as he felt her walls squeezing around him. Her eyes fell shut, her head tossed back, and now she couldn&rsquo;t stop whimpering meaningless words, the only thing that made sense was his name.</p><p>&ldquo;We finally had sex on the beach, you happy?&rdquo; He jokingly asked while still catching his breath, his hooded eyes stared right into hers.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dick,&rdquo; she said, smiling at the way his eyes sparkled in the dark like those stars right above them. That playful insult only made him chortle. He brought his mouth back on hers to kiss her tenderly.</p><p>&ldquo;And also your husband, so you&rsquo;re stuck with this dick for the rest of your life,&rdquo; he spoke against her lips, causing her to dissolve into laughter. Harry temporarily forgot about the fate of his father&rsquo;s company, and the stress he felt thinking he was the reason for it. At this moment, there were only them and them alone, though he knew it couldn&rsquo;t be them forever. When this week was over they would have to return to their busy lives. So now he must hold her closer, not wanting another second to go to waste.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Did you know that Niall almost lost Treasure when he took her to the mall with him?&rdquo; Y/N said the second she showed up at their bedroom door with the cat in her arms. Harry had just finished getting dressed for work. He turned away from the mirror and flashed his wife a cheeky grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Did Treasure tell you that?&rdquo;</p><p>She snorted, rolling her eyes and put the cat down on their bed to come fix his collar. &ldquo;Layla told me&hellip;We should let Ben and Nam watch Treasure next time we&rsquo;re away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; He nodded. It was then that she finally looked up and caught the way he was staring at her. Neither of them said a word. After many years under the same roof, they didn&rsquo;t have to speak to know what was on the other person&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried again, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She questioned, placing both hands on his shoulders. &ldquo;I mean&hellip;if you wanna help your dad keep the company&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had this talk, love,&rdquo; he cut her off, seemingly displeased. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;</p><p>When he kissed her on the cheek and attempted to go, she squeezed his arms to force his eyes back on her. She&rsquo;d thought a lot about Stephanie&rsquo;s words, and maybe Stephanie was not entirely wrong. Of course she didn&rsquo;t want anything more from Harry, for he&rsquo;d always been more than enough. Despite so she felt awful that he had to give up on such a great opportunity for her. If he&rsquo;d never met her, maybe he would&rsquo;ve been rich and much more successful than he was now. He would&rsquo;ve been his own boss and driving nice cars and probably engaged to someone from a rich family. He could&rsquo;ve had it all. The least she could do now as his wife was encourage him to do what was best for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Love, just accept the job, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot leave you here and move to San Francisco.&rdquo; He chuckled, yet she seemed so serious and he knew it wasn&rsquo;t time to joke around.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you and&hellip;and find a new job there&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Harry was paralyzed for a long moment when he heard those words. His wife, who&rsquo;d loved her job more than anything, was willing to drop everything just so he could be the CEO his father expected him to be. And he knew it was all because she loved him and she blamed herself for what she thought he&rsquo;d lost. The truth, however, was that he never needed anything more than her. </p><p>Harry pulled Y/N into his arms, one hand at the back of her head as he whispered into her ear, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s not talk about this anymore, alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to work today?&rdquo; He changed the subject, knowing how easy it was for her to get distracted.</p><p>&ldquo;Got a day off.&rdquo; Y/N pressed her lips into a smile as she picked up their cat and followed her husband to the front door. Since Harry was extremely forgetful, they always had to do the <i>'checklist&rsquo;</i> together every morning before leaving home.</p><p>&ldquo;Umbrella?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Already in my bag.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Car key?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry flinched when he stuck his hand into his coat pocket and couldn&rsquo;t find the key. The frantic look on his face made his wife laugh as she handed it to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You left it by the sink&hellip;again,&rdquo; she said, resulting in a smile of relief on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best. Love you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; She called out when he was about to leave. &ldquo;Forgetting something else?&rdquo;</p><p>He shot her a look of confused, until she lifted her face and pointed to her lips, eyes closed. With a smile, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to walk back and kiss her goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, now you can go,&rdquo; she said, patting his cheek. &ldquo;Have a great da&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N could barely finish her sentence when all of a sudden the door opposite from theirs creaked open. The couple nearly screamed as they saw who it was.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me?!&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes expanded to the point they could just fall out. &ldquo;Why are <i>you</i> here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is my new place,&rdquo; said Mason, who looked just as pissed off. In all honesty, Y/N and Harry thought this was better than having to deal with his pretentious <i>'kindness&rsquo;.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you knew we lived here, asshole,&rdquo; Harry snarled at him. &ldquo;You expect us to believe this is another coincidence?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You actually think we remembered your address and your flat number so we could get this flat because we&rsquo;re so obsessed with you?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N nodded fast. &ldquo;Yeah, Mason, that&rsquo;s exactly what we think.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry threw his hands in the air, face screwed up as he turned to his wife. &ldquo;What kind of shitty alternate universe is this?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you complaining? I&rsquo;m the one with crazy neighbors here.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry turned a deaf ear to his cousin&rsquo;s insult. He would love to stay and start another fight, but he didn&rsquo;t want this asshole to be the reason he was late for work. He said goodbye to his wife, yet before leaving, he didn&rsquo;t forget to give Mason the finger and walked off without a second look back.</p><p>Y/N watched him go with heart eyes a wide smile on her face, while Mason could not look anymore irritated. That was when Stephanie showed up at the door, holding a yellow cat. The woman looked as shocked as her husband to see Y/N standing there. It was Treasure who broke the hostile silence. She meowed loudly, probably excited to see her new cat neighbor. But Stephanie didn&rsquo;t seem so fond of the idea of their two cats being friends. Giving Y/N a look of disgust, she told her pet, &ldquo;<i>Tiger</i>, stop looking at that dirty creature. You might get eye cancer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then I&rsquo;m already blind from looking at you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N walked in and slammed the door shut, not wanting to hear more from Stephanie. Now that they were alone and away from their evil new neighbors, she gave Treasure a stern look. &ldquo;<i>Do not</i> associate with that family, you understand me?&rdquo;</p><p>The car purred softly in response, and Y/N hoped the answer was yes.</p></p>",

He\u2019d been ready since you both said <i>I</i> <i>do</i>, but you wanted time, time with just him</p><p>He\u2019d seen your wandering eyes linger on a mother and her child while you were out to lunch. You passed through the baby aisle at the store, not grabbing a thing. And when his friends stopped by with their three month old boy, you didn\u2019t want to put him down. But still, he kept silent. He saw the gears in your head working overtime, and he knew it was coming. </p><p>It was a humid day, right in the middle of summer, when you approached him. Harry had flashbacks of the first date you two shared, your bashful smile and nervous hands. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, Harry,\u201d you whispered, rolling your lips in. \u201cI want a baby.\u201d</p><p>To this day he can\u2019t pinpoint exactly what emotions were swarming him, they must have been new. All he truly recalls is snatching you from the lounge chair you were stretched out on and pulling you in for a hug that put all other hugs to shame. </p><p>He\u2019s showering you in kisses, every pet name he can think of tumbling past his lips as he suggests you two get to work, tugging you back into the house and up the stairs. </p><p>He spends a lot of these five minutes running his eyes over you, glancing down at your stomach once you\u2019re both bare with just the thought of his baby, your baby, growing inside his love. </p><p>And he presses a hard, passionate kiss right on your lips, running his thumb over your cheek and declaring his love for you. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my world, y\u2019know? My angel. Gonna make another one, yeah? Another darling I can cherish. Give you both anything, and all my love, you\u2019ll have all my love.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you tell him you\u2019re pregnant is silent. You\u2019ve searched the internet for a cute way to present the news, a meaningful way to announce the creation of your love for each other. </p><p>It\u2019d been months since you first started trying, and needless to say you were both sinking into disappointment every time a test didn\u2019t yield the results you were after. But having bought yet another box while Harry was at work, you decided to try once more. </p><p>And now with Christmas right around the corner, it\u2019d be crazy for you <i>not</i> to make this a gift for him. </p><p>You were both surrounded by wrapping paper, still in your pajamas with forgotten mugs of coffee abandoned in the kitchen while you told Harry he still had one gift left. </p><p>It was a small, square box with a red ribbon adorning the green paper that you pulled out from the tree itself. Harry chuckled at the hiding place and offered a kiss when you joined him back on the floor. </p><p>You were fidgeting, positively squirming as he gently pulled the ribbon apart and popped off the lid. His brows furrowed at the first recognition of a tiny t-shirt\u2014a gag gift perhaps? It would explain your restlessness. </p><p>But when he pulled the shirt out and unfolded it across his lap, he\u2019s sure his heart stopped for a moment. He couldn\u2019t move, staring at the infant sized clothing with \u2018<i>Daddy said I\u2019m a Packers Fan</i>\u2019 written across the front. </p><p>His jaw wavered and he swallowed a dry, hollow, gulp. The only thing he wants to look at right now is you, he needs <i>the nod</i>\u2014the one he\u2019s seen in movies and read about in books, the one where you\u2019ll shyly smile and roll your lips in while your head silently says <i>yes, this is really happening</i>. So he darts his eyes up from the tiny shirt in his shaky hands to your face. You nod. </p><p>He has a million things to say but they all come out in breathless huffs and dizzy laughs. He scrambles over to you and pulls you in, surely giving you the tightest, warmest hug you ever received. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re&hellip;I\u2026\u201d He pulls back and searches your eyes. He must be dreaming. \u201cThis is&hellip;we\u2019re really\u2026\u201d</p><p>You giggle and nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d His lips finally tug into a smile. He shakes his head and flickers his eyes between your face and your stomach. <i>They\u2019re in there, tiny, microscopic, but they\u2019re there.</i></p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to tell you. Almost slipped up a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m speechless.\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh bubbles out of your mouth. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>You lean over the few inches he\u2019s allowed between the two of you and press a soft, sweet, we\u2019ve made a baby kiss to his lips. (As best you can, he can\u2019t stop smiling). </p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes <i>before</i> you endure the joys of pregnancy are much more agonizing than the five after. And Harry knew he\u2019d be <i>that</i> husband, but he had no idea how well he\u2019d slip into the role of \u2018stress and worry about every move you made.\u2019</p><p>Needless to say, when you wake up feeling like you swallowed a model rocket ready for lift off, complete with a watery mouth and sore back, he panics. Your body\u2019s in a state he doesn\u2019t truly know how to take care of\u2014sure he\u2019s obsessed (healthily) over the idea of being a dad, of you being pregnant. He\u2019s a godfather and has a breeding kink that he won\u2019t admit to. But the actual changes, the actual pain and metamorphosis that you\u2019ve been going through and will continue to go through for the next six months, scares him to pieces. </p><p>So for that first five minutes he\u2019s pacing. He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off you as you wait patiently on the cold tile floor, already hunched over the toilet. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d</p><p>You really need him to shut up. You\u2019re fine, you\u2019re throwing up. It\u2019s what pregnant women do. But when he\u2019s nervous\u2014as he gets if you so much as put a hand to your forehead and sigh\u2014it sparks the own nervous energy in you to take over. Because things could go wrong, you\u2019re not out of the woods, and yeah you\u2019re probably inching closer to the bowl because of the hot sauce you added to your chicken the night before (add spicy food to the list of things you can\u2019t eat), but when he asks you again\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>&hellip;you burst. </p><p>\u201cHarry for fucks sake would you shut up!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent after that. The remainder of the five minutes he obeys and keeps his mouth quiet. He doesn\u2019t leave, stays leant against the counter, but he doesn\u2019t talk. </p><p>When you\u2019re brushing your teeth you look over at him. He\u2019s pale and fidgety, like a child who received forgiveness but <i>knows</i> their parent is still mad. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You spit out your toothpaste and repeat the words so he can understand them this time. </p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you like that. I can\u2019t do anything, I can\u2019t fix it, I can\u2019t make you feel better. You\u2019re going through things I\u2019ll never understand and you have to do it all alone. I just\u2026\u201d he sighs, loosening the tension in his shoulders with a roll of his back. \u201cI worry, y\u2019know? You\u2019re my everything. If something happens to you\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish his sentence, the last few words lucky they made it out, as wobbly and frail as they were. </p><p>\u201cHey, look at me.\u201d You\u2019re stern as you approach him. \u201cI&rsquo;m <i>never</i> alone, okay? I have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh uh. Yeah, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s pregnant, but that\u2019s just a small portion of everything that\u2019s ahead. Nine months. Nine months and then you\u2019ll be put to work.\u201d You smile once he cracks a smirk. \u201cAnd in the meantime, you&rsquo;ve been the best support I could ask for. I never feel alone in all of this.\u201d</p><p>His smirk grows. \u201cBecause I never leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>You laugh around your words. \u201cYeah that\u2019s part of it.\u201d Your hands gently slide up his arms to rest on his shoulders. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be fine. Doctor says everything\u2019s good. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf&hellip;<i>if</i> something happens, we\u2019ll handle it. Worrying about whether something may or may not happen doesn\u2019t prepare us, and it certainly doesn\u2019t make things easier.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at you, eyes twinkling with a confident look you haven\u2019t seen in a while. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you step out of the shower, the morning Harry is supposed to be home after a week away, is bliss. </p><p>He\u2019d pulled his clothes off tiredly in the bedroom, willing himself to stay awake until he can greet you with a proper kiss once you\u2019re out. He avoids the bed, knowing if he even sits on the edge he\u2019ll pass out. </p><p>He pours a cold glass of water and is on his way back up the stairs when he hears the rush of the shower come to a halt. He speeds up, stepping into the steam-filled room just as you\u2019re unfolding your towel to wrap around your body. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d He\u2019s pointing at you, frozen in the doorway, and you break into a stifling panic because the last time his words got caught in his throat with a pointed finger, there was a spider the size of your hand behind you. </p><p>\u201cWhat? What!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bump!\u201d</p><p>Your lips tweak into a smile, and for the first time in a long time you feel truly shy around him. \u201cNoticed it the other day, when I tried on that orange dress.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t time to wrap the towel around you before <i>he</i> was wrapped around you, his arms pulling you in flush against his chest, but only for a moment, as he steps back to admire the swell of your belly. </p><p>It\u2019s not that noticeable, you\u2019d have to be attentive to that part of your body to see the difference compared to a couple weeks ago. There\u2019s no need to rush out and stock up on maternity wear and you don\u2019t have to worry about the friends and family you haven\u2019t told yet finding out. </p><p>But it <i>is</i> exciting. It\u2019s your baby, yours and Harry\u2019s baby. And it\u2019s healthy and growing and now you\u2019re showing&hellip;Harry\u2019s enthralled. </p><p>He flicks his eyes up and waits for your nod before smoothing his hand over your belly button. His hand is big and warm. His rings are absent which you\u2019re thankful for, not needing the cold on your skin right after a shower. </p><p>\u201cI love our baby,\u201d he muses against your hair. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome home.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes in the baby store is ridiculous. Harry, is ridiculous. He\u2019s got half the cart full and he\u2019s really in his own little world. </p><p>\u201cLook at these, love.\u201d He holds up the smallest pair of mittens you\u2019ve ever seen, with the biggest smile you\u2019ve ever seen on his face. \u201cLook how tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s tiny, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He tosses them in the cart. </p><p>You\u2019re not complaining; his enthusiasm is contagious. You\u2019re excited yourself, but having someone to share it with, someone who looks over the moon at every item being thrown in the cart, is the cherry on top. </p><p>You\u2019re running your eyes over the rows and rows of socks, all a different color, all incredibly small. </p><p>\u201cWhat color?\u201d He asks, tugging you back to rest against his chest. </p><p>\u201cWould you care if I said one of each?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get another cart.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after your first contraction is scary. It\u2019s definitely a contraction. You\u2019ve endured a bout of Braxton Hicks and what you\u2019re feeling now is the major leagues. </p><p>It\u2019s that moment of no return. You\u2019ve been in that state for quite a while, but it\u2019s successfully and overwhelmingly dawning on you: you\u2019re going into labor. </p><p>It\u2019s not about the pregnancy and it\u2019s not about the child a week from now. It\u2019s about this very moment and the hours to follow that have you second guessing this entire decision. You were ready to be pregnant and ready to teach your six year old how to ride a bike. You are not ready to give birth. </p><p>Harry settles down on the floor beside the tub and cups your cheek in his palm. He holds up his phone with the timer at zero on the screen. \u201cTell me when,\u201d he whispers. </p><p>You nod and rest your head back against the linoleum, shutting out the light with your eyes and focusing on your body. Your body that was designed to perform this miracle, your body that has gone through nine months of rapid changes, your body that\u2019s been through so much already. </p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe in.\u201d He watches you relax in the water, making a mental note of your habit of holding your breath. \u201cGood. I love you, you\u2019re doing so good. Have been always.\u201d </p><p>His thumb strokes over your cheek and he asks if that\u2019s okay. You nod and peak your eyes open, watching the timer on his phone tick by. It\u2019s going too slow. Six minutes, the doctor had told you. Six minutes and it\u2019s time to leave for the hospital. You\u2019re not ready, <i>please don\u2019t stop at six. </i></p><p>\u201cThe bags are in the car. And I\u2019ve called your mum. Mine too.\u201d He sets the phone down and dips his hand in the water, not letting go of you. \u201cS\u2019this warm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d You\u2019re voice is shakier than you were expecting. You look up at him, and just by the look on his face, you know he knows. </p><p>\u201cYou can do this. You\u2019ve done so much already, this is the last step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest step though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can do it\u201d</p><p>You open your mouth, but it takes a couple swallows before you can speak. \u201cI\u2019m so scared. I didn\u2019t think I would be but I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re scared about.\u201d</p><p>You flicker your eyes up from the timer to his face, brows pulling in to say <i>take a fucking guess</i>. Instead you shrug. \u201cI\u2014just everything. The pain. The stitches. Something going wrong. Me dying, our baby dying. Something being wrong with them. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t blink. He has no right to tell you not to be scared. No right to try and de-rationalize your fears. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s body is preparing for something terrifying at this very moment, something you can\u2019t truly prepare for no matter how many women you\u2019ve asked &hellip;<i>so how bad does it really hurt</i>? You\u2019re the one giving birth, not him. </p><p>\u201cAre you not scared?\u201d He catches the hint behind your words. You\u2019re almost asking for the secret he seems to hold, because ever since you woke up from your nap with a buzzsaw in your gut, he\u2019s been calm and collected. </p><p>\u201cF\u2019course I am. Not gonna lie to you. You\u2019re having a baby&hellip;that\u2019ll never <i>not</i> be scary. If we have ten kids I\u2019ll still be scared on our tenth trip to the hospital.\u201d He pauses for a breath. \u201cBut I also <i>know</i> that you can do this. I know that you\u2019re incredibly strong, stronger than I\u2019ll ever dream of being. You\u2019re healthy and the baby\u2019s healthy. You\u2019ve got a fight in you that I fell in love with. You don\u2019t give up on anything, you don\u2019t back down. You power through and show me time and time again how un-fucking-believable you are.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wiping the tears that have started to trickle down your cheeks and for a second he worries he\u2019s said something wrong. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Your voice is still brittle, but when you look up at him the light in your eyes has changed. </p><p>\u201cThank <i>you</i>,\u201d he smothers a kiss onto your lips, \u201cthank you, thank you, thank you for everything.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you\u2019ve brought your child into the world are heavenly. Your body is more than exhausted, numb, yet you feel everything. You\u2019re not even sure if what you\u2019re feeling <i>is</i> your body. There\u2019s a lot of noise, a lot of chaos as you lay there. </p><p>The voices are all in a tunnel. The only one you really tune in to is the high pitched scream, a decibel breaking siren that is somehow coming from the tiny human being placed on your chest. </p><p>Then it\u2019s your own voice. You\u2019re crying; not sad, just relieved, overworked, and <i>so</i> fucking happy. Despite the excruciating wringer you\u2019ve just been yanked through, you\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat&hellip;maybe Harry will convince you to have three. </p><p>\u201cHey little one.\u201d You softly stroke your finger down your newborn\u2019s cheek, the wailing yet to cease. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The room starts to slow and soon you\u2019re taking everything in again. Harry\u2019s by your side. He never left, although he\u2019s back in focus now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so, <i>so</i> proud of you.\u201d He\u2019s holding his baby, cradling their head just like he practiced a million times. And he\u2019s looking at you, <i>in</i> you, if that\u2019s possible, into the very depths of whatever harbors the strength you showed today. And of course the tears are dripping down his cheeks. He\u2019s so fucking happy too. \u201cI love you. I love you so\u2014I just love you.\u201d </p><p>He shakes his head. There aren\u2019t really words, are there?</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d He smiles at his child, running his eyes over the features he can\u2019t get enough of. It really is the two of you, all wrapped up in this small bundle blinking up at him. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna let muma rest now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He bends down to place a kiss on your forehead. You feel a tear beside his lips. \u201cI love you, my darling. Close your eyes, you\u2019ll be fast asleep in five minutes.\u201d</p>",

But having bought yet another box while Harry was at work, you decided to try once more. </p><p>And now with Christmas right around the corner, it\u2019d be crazy for you <i>not</i> to make this a gift for him. </p><p>You were both surrounded by wrapping paper, still in your pajamas with forgotten mugs of coffee abandoned in the kitchen while you told Harry he still had one gift left. </p><p>It was a small, square box with a red ribbon adorning the green paper that you pulled out from the tree itself. Harry chuckled at the hiding place and offered a kiss when you joined him back on the floor. </p><p>You were fidgeting, positively squirming as he gently pulled the ribbon apart and popped off the lid. His brows furrowed at the first recognition of a tiny t-shirt\u2014a gag gift perhaps? It would explain your restlessness. </p><p>But when he pulled the shirt out and unfolded it across his lap, he\u2019s sure his heart stopped for a moment. He couldn\u2019t move, staring at the infant sized clothing with \u2018<i>Daddy said I\u2019m a Packers Fan</i>\u2019 written across the front. </p><p>His jaw wavered and he swallowed a dry, hollow, gulp. The only thing he wants to look at right now is you, he needs <i>the nod</i>\u2014the one he\u2019s seen in movies and read about in books, the one where you\u2019ll shyly smile and roll your lips in while your head silently says <i>yes, this is really happening</i>. So he darts his eyes up from the tiny shirt in his shaky hands to your face. You nod. </p><p>He has a million things to say but they all come out in breathless huffs and dizzy laughs. He scrambles over to you and pulls you in, surely giving you the tightest, warmest hug you ever received. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026I\u2026\u201d He pulls back and searches your eyes. He must be dreaming. \u201cThis is\u2026we\u2019re really\u2026\u201d</p><p>You giggle and nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d His lips finally tug into a smile. He shakes his head and flickers his eyes between your face and your stomach. <i>They\u2019re in there, tiny, microscopic, but they\u2019re there.</i></p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to tell you. Almost slipped up a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m speechless.\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh bubbles out of your mouth. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>You lean over the few inches he\u2019s allowed between the two of you and press a soft, sweet, we\u2019ve made a baby kiss to his lips. (As best you can, he can\u2019t stop smiling). </p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes <i>before</i> you endure the joys of pregnancy are much more agonizing than the five after. And Harry knew he\u2019d be <i>that</i> husband, but he had no idea how well he\u2019d slip into the role of \u2018stress and worry about every move you made.\u2019</p><p>Needless to say, when you wake up feeling like you swallowed a model rocket ready for lift off, complete with a watery mouth and sore back, he panics. Your body\u2019s in a state he doesn\u2019t truly know how to take care of\u2014sure he\u2019s obsessed (healthily) over the idea of being a dad, of you being pregnant. He\u2019s a godfather and has a breeding kink that he won\u2019t admit to. But the actual changes, the actual pain and metamorphosis that you\u2019ve been going through and will continue to go through for the next six months, scares him to pieces. </p><p>So for that first five minutes he\u2019s pacing. He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off you as you wait patiently on the cold tile floor, already hunched over the toilet. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d</p><p>You really need him to shut up. You\u2019re fine, you\u2019re throwing up. It\u2019s what pregnant women do. But when he\u2019s nervous\u2014as he gets if you so much as put a hand to your forehead and sigh\u2014it sparks the own nervous energy in you to take over. Because things could go wrong, you\u2019re not out of the woods, and yeah you\u2019re probably inching closer to the bowl because of the hot sauce you added to your chicken the night before (add spicy food to the list of things you can\u2019t eat), but when he asks you again\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u2026you burst. </p><p>\u201cHarry for fucks sake would you shut up!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent after that. The remainder of the five minutes he obeys and keeps his mouth quiet. He doesn\u2019t leave, stays leant against the counter, but he doesn\u2019t talk. </p><p>When you\u2019re brushing your teeth you look over at him. He\u2019s pale and fidgety, like a child who received forgiveness but <i>knows</i> their parent is still mad. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You spit out your toothpaste and repeat the words so he can understand them this time. </p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you like that. I can\u2019t do anything, I can\u2019t fix it, I can\u2019t make you feel better. You\u2019re going through things I\u2019ll never understand and you have to do it all alone. I just\u2026\u201d he sighs, loosening the tension in his shoulders with a roll of his back. \u201cI worry, y\u2019know? You\u2019re my everything. If something happens to you\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish his sentence, the last few words lucky they made it out, as wobbly and frail as they were. </p><p>\u201cHey, look at me.\u201d You\u2019re stern as you approach him. \u201cI\u2019m <i>never</i> alone, okay? I have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh uh. Yeah, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s pregnant, but that\u2019s just a small portion of everything that\u2019s ahead. Nine months. Nine months and then you\u2019ll be put to work.\u201d You smile once he cracks a smirk. \u201cAnd in the meantime, you\u2019ve been the best support I could ask for. I never feel alone in all of this.\u201d</p><p>His smirk grows. \u201cBecause I never leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>You laugh around your words. \u201cYeah that\u2019s part of it.\u201d Your hands gently slide up his arms to rest on his shoulders. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be fine. Doctor says everything\u2019s good. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\u2026<i>if</i> something happens, we\u2019ll handle it. Worrying about whether something may or may not happen doesn\u2019t prepare us, and it certainly doesn\u2019t make things easier.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at you, eyes twinkling with a confident look you haven\u2019t seen in a while. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you step out of the shower, the morning Harry is supposed to be home after a week away, is bliss. </p><p>He\u2019d pulled his clothes off tiredly in the bedroom, willing himself to stay awake until he can greet you with a proper kiss once you\u2019re out. He avoids the bed, knowing if he even sits on the edge he\u2019ll pass out. </p><p>He pours a cold glass of water and is on his way back up the stairs when he hears the rush of the shower come to a halt. He speeds up, stepping into the steam-filled room just as you\u2019re unfolding your towel to wrap around your body. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d He\u2019s pointing at you, frozen in the doorway, and you break into a stifling panic because the last time his words got caught in his throat with a pointed finger, there was a spider the size of your hand behind you. </p><p>\u201cWhat? What!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bump!\u201d</p><p>Your lips tweak into a smile, and for the first time in a long time you feel truly shy around him. \u201cNoticed it the other day, when I tried on that orange dress.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t time to wrap the towel around you before <i>he</i> was wrapped around you, his arms pulling you in flush against his chest, but only for a moment, as he steps back to admire the swell of your belly. </p><p>It\u2019s not that noticeable, you\u2019d have to be attentive to that part of your body to see the difference compared to a couple weeks ago. There\u2019s no need to rush out and stock up on maternity wear and you don\u2019t have to worry about the friends and family you haven\u2019t told yet finding out. </p><p>But it <i>is</i> exciting. It\u2019s your baby, yours and Harry\u2019s baby. And it\u2019s healthy and growing and now you\u2019re showing\u2026Harry\u2019s enthralled. </p><p>He flicks his eyes up and waits for your nod before smoothing his hand over your belly button. His hand is big and warm. His rings are absent which you\u2019re thankful for, not needing the cold on your skin right after a shower. </p><p>\u201cI love our baby,\u201d he muses against your hair. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome home.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes in the baby store is ridiculous. Harry, is ridiculous. He\u2019s got half the cart full and he\u2019s really in his own little world. </p><p>\u201cLook at these, love.\u201d He holds up the smallest pair of mittens you\u2019ve ever seen, with the biggest smile you\u2019ve ever seen on his face. \u201cLook how tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s tiny, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He tosses them in the cart. </p><p>You\u2019re not complaining; his enthusiasm is contagious. You\u2019re excited yourself, but having someone to share it with, someone who looks over the moon at every item being thrown in the cart, is the cherry on top. </p><p>You\u2019re running your eyes over the rows and rows of socks, all a different color, all incredibly small. </p><p>\u201cWhat color?\u201d He asks, tugging you back to rest against his chest. </p><p>\u201cWould you care if I said one of each?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get another cart.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after your first contraction is scary. It\u2019s definitely a contraction. You\u2019ve endured a bout of Braxton Hicks and what you\u2019re feeling now is the major leagues. </p><p>It\u2019s that moment of no return. You\u2019ve been in that state for quite a while, but it\u2019s successfully and overwhelmingly dawning on you: you\u2019re going into labor. </p><p>It\u2019s not about the pregnancy and it\u2019s not about the child a week from now. It\u2019s about this very moment and the hours to follow that have you second guessing this entire decision. You were ready to be pregnant and ready to teach your six year old how to ride a bike. You are not ready to give birth. </p><p>Harry settles down on the floor beside the tub and cups your cheek in his palm. He holds up his phone with the timer at zero on the screen. \u201cTell me when,\u201d he whispers. </p><p>You nod and rest your head back against the linoleum, shutting out the light with your eyes and focusing on your body. Your body that was designed to perform this miracle, your body that has gone through nine months of rapid changes, your body that\u2019s been through so much already. </p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe in.\u201d He watches you relax in the water, making a mental note of your habit of holding your breath. \u201cGood. I love you, you\u2019re doing so good. Have been always.\u201d </p><p>His thumb strokes over your cheek and he asks if that\u2019s okay. You nod and peak your eyes open, watching the timer on his phone tick by. It\u2019s going too slow. Six minutes, the doctor had told you. Six minutes and it\u2019s time to leave for the hospital. You\u2019re not ready, <i>please don\u2019t stop at six. </i></p><p>\u201cThe bags are in the car. And I\u2019ve called your mum. Mine too.\u201d He sets the phone down and dips his hand in the water, not letting go of you. \u201cS\u2019this warm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d You\u2019re voice is shakier than you were expecting. You look up at him, and just by the look on his face, you know he knows. </p><p>\u201cYou can do this. You\u2019ve done so much already, this is the last step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest step though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can do it\u201d</p><p>You open your mouth, but it takes a couple swallows before you can speak. \u201cI\u2019m so scared. I didn\u2019t think I would be but I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re scared about.\u201d</p><p>You flicker your eyes up from the timer to his face, brows pulling in to say <i>take a fucking guess</i>. Instead you shrug. \u201cI\u2014just everything. The pain. The stitches. Something going wrong. Me dying, our baby dying. Something being wrong with them. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t blink. He has no right to tell you not to be scared. No right to try and de-rationalize your fears. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s body is preparing for something terrifying at this very moment, something you can\u2019t truly prepare for no matter how many women you\u2019ve asked \u2026<i>so how bad does it really hurt</i>? You\u2019re the one giving birth, not him. </p><p>\u201cAre you not scared?\u201d He catches the hint behind your words. You\u2019re almost asking for the secret he seems to hold, because ever since you woke up from your nap with a buzzsaw in your gut, he\u2019s been calm and collected. </p><p>\u201cF\u2019course I am. Not gonna lie to you. You\u2019re having a baby\u2026that\u2019ll never <i>not</i> be scary. If we have ten kids I\u2019ll still be scared on our tenth trip to the hospital.\u201d He pauses for a breath. \u201cBut I also <i>know</i> that you can do this. I know that you\u2019re incredibly strong, stronger than I\u2019ll ever dream of being. You\u2019re healthy and the baby\u2019s healthy. You\u2019ve got a fight in you that I fell in love with. You don\u2019t give up on anything, you don\u2019t back down. You power through and show me time and time again how un-fucking-believable you are.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wiping the tears that have started to trickle down your cheeks and for a second he worries he\u2019s said something wrong. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Your voice is still brittle, but when you look up at him the light in your eyes has changed. </p><p>\u201cThank <i>you</i>,\u201d he smothers a kiss onto your lips, \u201cthank you, thank you, thank you for everything.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you\u2019ve brought your child into the world are heavenly. Your body is more than exhausted, numb, yet you feel everything. You\u2019re not even sure if what you\u2019re feeling <i>is</i> your body. There\u2019s a lot of noise, a lot of chaos as you lay there. </p><p>The voices are all in a tunnel. The only one you really tune in to is the high pitched scream, a decibel breaking siren that is somehow coming from the tiny human being placed on your chest. </p><p>Then it\u2019s your own voice. You\u2019re crying; not sad, just relieved, overworked, and <i>so</i> fucking happy. Despite the excruciating wringer you\u2019ve just been yanked through, you\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat\u2026maybe Harry will convince you to have three. </p><p>\u201cHey little one.\u201d You softly stroke your finger down your newborn\u2019s cheek, the wailing yet to cease. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The room starts to slow and soon you\u2019re taking everything in again. Harry\u2019s by your side. He never left, although he\u2019s back in focus now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so, <i>so</i> proud of you.\u201d He\u2019s holding his baby, cradling their head just like he practiced a million times. And he\u2019s looking at you, <i>in</i> you, if that\u2019s possible, into the very depths of whatever harbors the strength you showed today. And of course the tears are dripping down his cheeks. He\u2019s so fucking happy too. \u201cI love you. I love you so\u2014I just love you.\u201d </p><p>He shakes his head. There aren\u2019t really words, are there?</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d He smiles at his child, running his eyes over the features he can\u2019t get enough of. It really is the two of you, all wrapped up in this small bundle blinking up at him. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna let muma rest now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He bends down to place a kiss on your forehead. You feel a tear beside his lips. \u201cI love you, my darling. Close your eyes, you\u2019ll be fast asleep in five minutes.\u201d</p></p>",

He\u2019d been ready since you both said <i>I</i> <i>do</i>, but you wanted time, time with just him</p><p>He\u2019d seen your wandering eyes linger on a mother and her child while you were out to lunch. You passed through the baby aisle at the store, not grabbing a thing. And when his friends stopped by with their three month old boy, you didn\u2019t want to put him down. But still, he kept silent. He saw the gears in your head working overtime, and he knew it was coming. </p><p>It was a humid day, right in the middle of summer, when you approached him. Harry had flashbacks of the first date you two shared, your bashful smile and nervous hands. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, Harry,\u201d you whispered, rolling your lips in. \u201cI want a baby.\u201d</p><p>To this day he can\u2019t pinpoint exactly what emotions were swarming him, they must have been new. All he truly recalls is snatching you from the lounge chair you were stretched out on and pulling you in for a hug that put all other hugs to shame. </p><p>He\u2019s showering you in kisses, every pet name he can think of tumbling past his lips as he suggests you two get to work, tugging you back into the house and up the stairs. </p><p>He spends a lot of these five minutes running his eyes over you, glancing down at your stomach once you\u2019re both bare with just the thought of his baby, your baby, growing inside his love. </p><p>And he presses a hard, passionate kiss right on your lips, running his thumb over your cheek and declaring his love for you. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my world, y\u2019know?

Harry chuckled at the hiding place and offered a kiss when you joined him back on the floor. </p><p>You were fidgeting, positively squirming as he gently pulled the ribbon apart and popped off the lid. His brows furrowed at the first recognition of a tiny t-shirt\u2014a gag gift perhaps? It would explain your restlessness. </p><p>But when he pulled the shirt out and unfolded it across his lap, he\u2019s sure his heart stopped for a moment. He couldn\u2019t move, staring at the infant sized clothing with \u2018<i>Daddy said I\u2019m a Packers Fan</i>\u2019 written across the front. </p><p>His jaw wavered and he swallowed a dry, hollow, gulp. The only thing he wants to look at right now is you, he needs <i>the nod</i>\u2014the one he\u2019s seen in movies and read about in books, the one where you\u2019ll shyly smile and roll your lips in while your head silently says <i>yes, this is really happening</i>. So he darts his eyes up from the tiny shirt in his shaky hands to your face. You nod. </p><p>He has a million things to say but they all come out in breathless huffs and dizzy laughs. He scrambles over to you and pulls you in, surely giving you the tightest, warmest hug you ever received. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026I\u2026\u201d He pulls back and searches your eyes. He must be dreaming. \u201cThis is\u2026we\u2019re really\u2026\u201d</p><p>You giggle and nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d His lips finally tug into a smile. He shakes his head and flickers his eyes between your face and your stomach. <i>They\u2019re in there, tiny, microscopic, but they\u2019re there.</i></p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to tell you. Almost slipped up a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m speechless.\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh bubbles out of your mouth. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>You lean over the few inches he\u2019s allowed between the two of you and press a soft, sweet, we\u2019ve made a baby kiss to his lips. (As best you can, he can\u2019t stop smiling). </p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes <i>before</i> you endure the joys of pregnancy are much more agonizing than the five after.

Your body\u2019s in a state he doesn\u2019t truly know how to take care of\u2014sure he\u2019s obsessed (healthily) over the idea of being a dad, of you being pregnant. He\u2019s a godfather and has a breeding kink that he won\u2019t admit to. But the actual changes, the actual pain and metamorphosis that you\u2019ve been going through and will continue to go through for the next six months, scares him to pieces. </p><p>So for that first five minutes he\u2019s pacing.

You\u2019re fine, you\u2019re throwing up. It\u2019s what pregnant women do. But when he\u2019s nervous\u2014as he gets if you so much as put a hand to your forehead and sigh\u2014it sparks the own nervous energy in you to take over. Because things could go wrong, you\u2019re not out of the woods, and yeah you\u2019re probably inching closer to the bowl because of the hot sauce you added to your chicken the night before (add spicy food to the list of things you can\u2019t eat), but when he asks you again\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d</p><p>\u2026you burst. </p><p>\u201cHarry for fucks sake would you shut up!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent after that. The remainder of the five minutes he obeys and keeps his mouth quiet. He doesn\u2019t leave, stays leant against the counter, but he doesn\u2019t talk. </p><p>When you\u2019re brushing your teeth you look over at him. He\u2019s pale and fidgety, like a child who received forgiveness but <i>knows</i> their parent is still mad. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You spit out your toothpaste and repeat the words so he can understand them this time. </p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you like that. I can\u2019t do anything, I can\u2019t fix it, I can\u2019t make you feel better. You\u2019re going through things I\u2019ll never understand and you have to do it all alone. I just\u2026\u201d he sighs, loosening the tension in his shoulders with a roll of his back. \u201cI worry, y\u2019know? You\u2019re my everything. If something happens to you\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish his sentence, the last few words lucky they made it out, as wobbly and frail as they were. </p><p>\u201cHey, look at me.\u201d You\u2019re stern as you approach him. \u201cI\u2019m <i>never</i> alone, okay?

Nine months and then you\u2019ll be put to work.\u201d You smile once he cracks a smirk. \u201cAnd in the meantime, you\u2019ve been the best support I could ask for. I never feel alone in all of this.\u201d</p><p>His smirk grows. \u201cBecause I never leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>You laugh around your words. \u201cYeah that\u2019s part of it.\u201d Your hands gently slide up his arms to rest on his shoulders. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be fine. Doctor says everything\u2019s good. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\u2026<i>if</i> something happens, we\u2019ll handle it. Worrying about whether something may or may not happen doesn\u2019t prepare us, and it certainly doesn\u2019t make things easier.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at you, eyes twinkling with a confident look you haven\u2019t seen in a while. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you step out of the shower, the morning Harry is supposed to be home after a week away, is bliss. </p><p>He\u2019d pulled his clothes off tiredly in the bedroom, willing himself to stay awake until he can greet you with a proper kiss once you\u2019re out. He avoids the bed, knowing if he even sits on the edge he\u2019ll pass out. </p><p>He pours a cold glass of water and is on his way back up the stairs when he hears the rush of the shower come to a halt. He speeds up, stepping into the steam-filled room just as you\u2019re unfolding your towel to wrap around your body. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d He\u2019s pointing at you, frozen in the doorway, and you break into a stifling panic because the last time his words got caught in his throat with a pointed finger, there was a spider the size of your hand behind you. </p><p>\u201cWhat? What!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bump!\u201d</p><p>Your lips tweak into a smile, and for the first time in a long time you feel truly shy around him. \u201cNoticed it the other day, when I tried on that orange dress.\u201d</p><p>You hadn\u2019t time to wrap the towel around you before <i>he</i> was wrapped around you, his arms pulling you in flush against his chest, but only for a moment, as he steps back to admire the swell of your belly. </p><p>It\u2019s not that noticeable, you\u2019d have to be attentive to that part of your body to see the difference compared to a couple weeks ago. There\u2019s no need to rush out and stock up on maternity wear and you don\u2019t have to worry about the friends and family you haven\u2019t told yet finding out. </p><p>But it <i>is</i> exciting. It\u2019s your baby, yours and Harry\u2019s baby. And it\u2019s healthy and growing and now you\u2019re showing\u2026Harry\u2019s enthralled. </p><p>He flicks his eyes up and waits for your nod before smoothing his hand over your belly button. His hand is big and warm. His rings are absent which you\u2019re thankful for, not needing the cold on your skin right after a shower. </p><p>\u201cI love our baby,\u201d he muses against your hair. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome home.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes in the baby store is ridiculous. Harry, is ridiculous. He\u2019s got half the cart full and he\u2019s really in his own little world. </p><p>\u201cLook at these, love.\u201d He holds up the smallest pair of mittens you\u2019ve ever seen, with the biggest smile you\u2019ve ever seen on his face. \u201cLook how tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s tiny, Harry.\u201d</p><p>He tosses them in the cart. </p><p>You\u2019re not complaining; his enthusiasm is contagious. You\u2019re excited yourself, but having someone to share it with, someone who looks over the moon at every item being thrown in the cart, is the cherry on top. </p><p>You\u2019re running your eyes over the rows and rows of socks, all a different color, all incredibly small. </p><p>\u201cWhat color?\u201d He asks, tugging you back to rest against his chest. </p><p>\u201cWould you care if I said one of each?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get another cart.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after your first contraction is scary. It\u2019s definitely a contraction. You\u2019ve endured a bout of Braxton Hicks and what you\u2019re feeling now is the major leagues. </p><p>It\u2019s that moment of no return. You\u2019ve been in that state for quite a while, but it\u2019s successfully and overwhelmingly dawning on you: you\u2019re going into labor. </p><p>It\u2019s not about the pregnancy and it\u2019s not about the child a week from now. It\u2019s about this very moment and the hours to follow that have you second guessing this entire decision. You were ready to be pregnant and ready to teach your six year old how to ride a bike. You are not ready to give birth. </p><p>Harry settles down on the floor beside the tub and cups your cheek in his palm. He holds up his phone with the timer at zero on the screen. \u201cTell me when,\u201d he whispers. </p><p>You nod and rest your head back against the linoleum, shutting out the light with your eyes and focusing on your body. Your body that was designed to perform this miracle, your body that has gone through nine months of rapid changes, your body that\u2019s been through so much already. </p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe in.\u201d He watches you relax in the water, making a mental note of your habit of holding your breath. \u201cGood. I love you, you\u2019re doing so good. Have been always.\u201d </p><p>His thumb strokes over your cheek and he asks if that\u2019s okay. You nod and peak your eyes open, watching the timer on his phone tick by. It\u2019s going too slow. Six minutes, the doctor had told you. Six minutes and it\u2019s time to leave for the hospital. You\u2019re not ready, <i>please don\u2019t stop at six. </i></p><p>\u201cThe bags are in the car. And I\u2019ve called your mum. Mine too.\u201d He sets the phone down and dips his hand in the water, not letting go of you. \u201cS\u2019this warm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d You\u2019re voice is shakier than you were expecting. You look up at him, and just by the look on his face, you know he knows. </p><p>\u201cYou can do this. You\u2019ve done so much already, this is the last step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest step though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can do it\u201d</p><p>You open your mouth, but it takes a couple swallows before you can speak. \u201cI\u2019m so scared. I didn\u2019t think I would be but I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re scared about.\u201d</p><p>You flicker your eyes up from the timer to his face, brows pulling in to say <i>take a fucking guess</i>. Instead you shrug. \u201cI\u2014just everything. The pain. The stitches. Something going wrong. Me dying, our baby dying. Something being wrong with them. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Harry doesn\u2019t blink. He has no right to tell you not to be scared. No right to try and de-rationalize your fears. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s body is preparing for something terrifying at this very moment, something you can\u2019t truly prepare for no matter how many women you\u2019ve asked \u2026<i>so how bad does it really hurt</i>? You\u2019re the one giving birth, not him. </p><p>\u201cAre you not scared?\u201d He catches the hint behind your words. You\u2019re almost asking for the secret he seems to hold, because ever since you woke up from your nap with a buzzsaw in your gut, he\u2019s been calm and collected. </p><p>\u201cF\u2019course I am. Not gonna lie to you. You\u2019re having a baby\u2026that\u2019ll never <i>not</i> be scary. If we have ten kids I\u2019ll still be scared on our tenth trip to the hospital.\u201d He pauses for a breath. \u201cBut I also <i>know</i> that you can do this. I know that you\u2019re incredibly strong, stronger than I\u2019ll ever dream of being. You\u2019re healthy and the baby\u2019s healthy. You\u2019ve got a fight in you that I fell in love with. You don\u2019t give up on anything, you don\u2019t back down. You power through and show me time and time again how un-fucking-believable you are.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s wiping the tears that have started to trickle down your cheeks and for a second he worries he\u2019s said something wrong. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Your voice is still brittle, but when you look up at him the light in your eyes has changed. </p><p>\u201cThank <i>you</i>,\u201d he smothers a kiss onto your lips, \u201cthank you, thank you, thank you for everything.\u201d</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you\u2019ve brought your child into the world are heavenly. Your body is more than exhausted, numb, yet you feel everything. You\u2019re not even sure if what you\u2019re feeling <i>is</i> your body. There\u2019s a lot of noise, a lot of chaos as you lay there. </p><p>The voices are all in a tunnel. The only one you really tune in to is the high pitched scream, a decibel breaking siren that is somehow coming from the tiny human being placed on your chest. </p><p>Then it\u2019s your own voice. You\u2019re crying; not sad, just relieved, overworked, and <i>so</i> fucking happy. Despite the excruciating wringer you\u2019ve just been yanked through, you\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat\u2026maybe Harry will convince you to have three. </p><p>\u201cHey little one.\u201d You softly stroke your finger down your newborn\u2019s cheek, the wailing yet to cease. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The room starts to slow and soon you\u2019re taking everything in again.

And he\u2019s looking at you, <i>in</i> you, if that\u2019s possible, into the very depths of whatever harbors the strength you showed today. And of course the tears are dripping down his cheeks. He\u2019s so fucking happy too. \u201cI love you. I love you so\u2014I just love you.\u201d </p><p>He shakes his head. There aren\u2019t really words, are there?</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d He smiles at his child, running his eyes over the features he can\u2019t get enough of.

He&rsquo;d been ready since you both said <i>I</i> <i>do</i>, but you wanted time, time with just him</p><p>He&rsquo;d seen your wandering eyes linger on a mother and her child while you were out to lunch. You passed through the baby aisle at the store, not grabbing a thing. And when his friends stopped by with their three month old boy, you didn&rsquo;t want to put him down. But still, he kept silent. He saw the gears in your head working overtime, and he knew it was coming. </p><p>It was a humid day, right in the middle of summer, when you approached him. Harry had flashbacks of the first date you two shared, your bashful smile and nervous hands. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready, Harry,&rdquo; you whispered, rolling your lips in. &ldquo;I want a baby.&rdquo;</p><p>To this day he can&rsquo;t pinpoint exactly what emotions were swarming him, they must have been new. All he truly recalls is snatching you from the lounge chair you were stretched out on and pulling you in for a hug that put all other hugs to shame. </p><p>He&rsquo;s showering you in kisses, every pet name he can think of tumbling past his lips as he suggests you two get to work, tugging you back into the house and up the stairs. </p><p>He spends a lot of these five minutes running his eyes over you, glancing down at your stomach once you&rsquo;re both bare with just the thought of his baby, your baby, growing inside his love. </p><p>And he presses a hard, passionate kiss right on your lips, running his thumb over your cheek and declaring his love for you. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my world, y&rsquo;know? My angel. Gonna make another one, yeah? Another darling I can cherish. Give you both anything, and all my love, you&rsquo;ll have all my love.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you tell him you&rsquo;re pregnant is silent. You&rsquo;ve searched the internet for a cute way to present the news, a meaningful way to announce the creation of your love for each other. </p><p>It&rsquo;d been months since you first started trying, and needless to say you were both sinking into disappointment every time a test didn&rsquo;t yield the results you were after. But having bought yet another box while Harry was at work, you decided to try once more. </p><p>And now with Christmas right around the corner, it&rsquo;d be crazy for you <i>not</i> to make this a gift for him. </p><p>You were both surrounded by wrapping paper, still in your pajamas with forgotten mugs of coffee abandoned in the kitchen while you told Harry he still had one gift left. </p><p>It was a small, square box with a red ribbon adorning the green paper that you pulled out from the tree itself. Harry chuckled at the hiding place and offered a kiss when you joined him back on the floor. </p><p>You were fidgeting, positively squirming as he gently pulled the ribbon apart and popped off the lid. His brows furrowed at the first recognition of a tiny t-shirt&mdash;a gag gift perhaps? It would explain your restlessness. </p><p>But when he pulled the shirt out and unfolded it across his lap, he&rsquo;s sure his heart stopped for a moment. He couldn&rsquo;t move, staring at the infant sized clothing with &lsquo;<i>Daddy said I&rsquo;m a Packers Fan</i>&rsquo; written across the front. </p><p>His jaw wavered and he swallowed a dry, hollow, gulp.

He speeds up, stepping into the steam-filled room just as you&rsquo;re unfolding your towel to wrap around your body. </p><p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; He&rsquo;s pointing at you, frozen in the doorway, and you break into a stifling panic because the last time his words got caught in his throat with a pointed finger, there was a spider the size of your hand behind you. </p><p>&ldquo;What? What!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a bump!&rdquo;</p><p>Your lips tweak into a smile, and for the first time in a long time you feel truly shy around him. &ldquo;Noticed it the other day, when I tried on that orange dress.&rdquo;</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t time to wrap the towel around you before <i>he</i> was wrapped around you, his arms pulling you in flush against his chest, but only for a moment, as he steps back to admire the swell of your belly. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not that noticeable, you&rsquo;d have to be attentive to that part of your body to see the difference compared to a couple weeks ago. There&rsquo;s no need to rush out and stock up on maternity wear and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the friends and family you haven&rsquo;t told yet finding out. </p><p>But it <i>is</i> exciting. It&rsquo;s your baby, yours and Harry&rsquo;s baby. And it&rsquo;s healthy and growing and now you&rsquo;re showing&hellip;Harry&rsquo;s enthralled. </p><p>He flicks his eyes up and waits for your nod before smoothing his hand over your belly button. His hand is big and warm. His rings are absent which you&rsquo;re thankful for, not needing the cold on your skin right after a shower. </p><p>&ldquo;I love our baby,&rdquo; he muses against your hair. &ldquo;And I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome home.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes in the baby store is ridiculous. Harry, is ridiculous. He&rsquo;s got half the cart full and he&rsquo;s really in his own little world. </p><p>&ldquo;Look at these, love.&rdquo; He holds up the smallest pair of mittens you&rsquo;ve ever seen, with the biggest smile you&rsquo;ve ever seen on his face. &ldquo;Look how tiny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s tiny, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>He tosses them in the cart. </p><p>You&rsquo;re not complaining; his enthusiasm is contagious. You&rsquo;re excited yourself, but having someone to share it with, someone who looks over the moon at every item being thrown in the cart, is the cherry on top. </p><p>You&rsquo;re running your eyes over the rows and rows of socks, all a different color, all incredibly small. </p><p>&ldquo;What color?&rdquo; He asks, tugging you back to rest against his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Would you care if I said one of each?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get another cart.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after your first contraction is scary. It&rsquo;s definitely a contraction. You&rsquo;ve endured a bout of Braxton Hicks and what you&rsquo;re feeling now is the major leagues. </p><p>It&rsquo;s that moment of no return. You&rsquo;ve been in that state for quite a while, but it&rsquo;s successfully and overwhelmingly dawning on you: you&rsquo;re going into labor. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not about the pregnancy and it&rsquo;s not about the child a week from now. It&rsquo;s about this very moment and the hours to follow that have you second guessing this entire decision. You were ready to be pregnant and ready to teach your six year old how to ride a bike. You are not ready to give birth. </p><p>Harry settles down on the floor beside the tub and cups your cheek in his palm. He holds up his phone with the timer at zero on the screen. &ldquo;Tell me when,&rdquo; he whispers. </p><p>You nod and rest your head back against the linoleum, shutting out the light with your eyes and focusing on your body. Your body that was designed to perform this miracle, your body that has gone through nine months of rapid changes, your body that&rsquo;s been through so much already. </p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Breathe in.&rdquo; He watches you relax in the water, making a mental note of your habit of holding your breath. &ldquo;Good. I love you, you&rsquo;re doing so good. Have been always.&rdquo; </p><p>His thumb strokes over your cheek and he asks if that&rsquo;s okay. You nod and peak your eyes open, watching the timer on his phone tick by. It&rsquo;s going too slow. Six minutes, the doctor had told you. Six minutes and it&rsquo;s time to leave for the hospital. You&rsquo;re not ready, <i>please don&rsquo;t stop at six. </i></p><p>&ldquo;The bags are in the car. And I&rsquo;ve called your mum. Mine too.&rdquo; He sets the phone down and dips his hand in the water, not letting go of you. &ldquo;S&rsquo;this warm enough?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re voice is shakier than you were expecting. You look up at him, and just by the look on his face, you know he knows. </p><p>&ldquo;You can do this. You&rsquo;ve done so much already, this is the last step.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hardest step though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you can do it&rdquo;</p><p>You open your mouth, but it takes a couple swallows before you can speak. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so scared. I didn&rsquo;t think I would be but I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what you&rsquo;re scared about.&rdquo;</p><p>You flicker your eyes up from the timer to his face, brows pulling in to say <i>take a fucking guess</i>. Instead you shrug. &ldquo;I&mdash;just everything. The pain. The stitches. Something going wrong. Me dying, our baby dying. Something being wrong with them. Everything.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry doesn&rsquo;t blink. He has no right to tell you not to be scared. No right to try and de-rationalize your fears. You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s body is preparing for something terrifying at this very moment, something you can&rsquo;t truly prepare for no matter how many women you&rsquo;ve asked &hellip;<i>so how bad does it really hurt</i>? You&rsquo;re the one giving birth, not him. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you not scared?&rdquo; He catches the hint behind your words. You&rsquo;re almost asking for the secret he seems to hold, because ever since you woke up from your nap with a buzzsaw in your gut, he&rsquo;s been calm and collected. </p><p>&ldquo;F&rsquo;course I am. Not gonna lie to you. You&rsquo;re having a baby&hellip;that&rsquo;ll never <i>not</i> be scary. If we have ten kids I&rsquo;ll still be scared on our tenth trip to the hospital.&rdquo; He pauses for a breath. &ldquo;But I also <i>know</i> that you can do this. I know that you&rsquo;re incredibly strong, stronger than I&rsquo;ll ever dream of being. You&rsquo;re healthy and the baby&rsquo;s healthy. You&rsquo;ve got a fight in you that I fell in love with. You don&rsquo;t give up on anything, you don&rsquo;t back down. You power through and show me time and time again how un-fucking-believable you are.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s wiping the tears that have started to trickle down your cheeks and for a second he worries he&rsquo;s said something wrong. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Your voice is still brittle, but when you look up at him the light in your eyes has changed. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank <i>you</i>,&rdquo; he smothers a kiss onto your lips, &ldquo;thank you, thank you, thank you for everything.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes after you&rsquo;ve brought your child into the world are heavenly. Your body is more than exhausted, numb, yet you feel everything. You&rsquo;re not even sure if what you&rsquo;re feeling <i>is</i> your body. There&rsquo;s a lot of noise, a lot of chaos as you lay there. </p><p>The voices are all in a tunnel. The only one you really tune in to is the high pitched scream, a decibel breaking siren that is somehow coming from the tiny human being placed on your chest. </p><p>Then it&rsquo;s your own voice. You&rsquo;re crying; not sad, just relieved, overworked, and <i>so</i> fucking happy. Despite the excruciating wringer you&rsquo;ve just been yanked through, you&rsquo;d do it again in a heartbeat&hellip;maybe Harry will convince you to have three. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey little one.&rdquo; You softly stroke your finger down your newborn&rsquo;s cheek, the wailing yet to cease. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>The room starts to slow and soon you&rsquo;re taking everything in again. Harry&rsquo;s by your side. He never left, although he&rsquo;s back in focus now. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so, <i>so</i> proud of you.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s holding his baby, cradling their head just like he practiced a million times. And he&rsquo;s looking at you, <i>in</i> you, if that&rsquo;s possible, into the very depths of whatever harbors the strength you showed today. And of course the tears are dripping down his cheeks. He&rsquo;s so fucking happy too. &ldquo;I love you. I love you so&mdash;I just love you.&rdquo; </p><p>He shakes his head. There aren&rsquo;t really words, are there?</p><p>&ldquo;And I love you.&rdquo; He smiles at his child, running his eyes over the features he can&rsquo;t get enough of. It really is the two of you, all wrapped up in this small bundle blinking up at him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna let muma rest now, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>He bends down to place a kiss on your forehead. You feel a tear beside his lips. &ldquo;I love you, my darling. Close your eyes, you&rsquo;ll be fast asleep in five minutes.&rdquo;</p></p>",
