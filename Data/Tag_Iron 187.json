Sleeping was impossible last night since about a thousand nerve-racking scenarios kept on repeating in his head.\u00a0</p><p>Of course he was getting shit from the other students - mostly Flash though.\u00a0<br/>He didn\u2019t dare to say anything back because the only possible thing that could come out of his mouth was\u00a0<i>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man so shut the hell up.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cWelcome to The Stark Industries! We\u2019re going\u00a0to start the tour in the first factory where we make the suit improvements and please guys no taking pictures in there so all your phones and other electronics\u00a0need to be left in the metal box that we put in front of the doors. Do you have any questions\u00a0before we go there?\u201d a well put together middle-aged lady jotted down something on a tablet and looked at the crowd of kids again.<br/></p><p>A short girl - Peter barely knew her from Spanish class but she was one of the nice ones - raised her hand high.\u00a0<br/>The woman nodded her way encouraging her to speak.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to meet Ms. Potts?\u201d she squeals in excitement.</p><p>\u201cOr any of the Avengers? Iron Man?!\u201d someone from the back shouts.<br/></p><p>\u201cUnfortunately no. Ms. Potts is on a business trip at this moment and Mr. Stark is a very busy man. The other superheroes have a lot of their own missions and things to do.\u201d the lady explains as politely as possible.</p><p><i>\u2018Yeah sure.\u2019 </i>Peter thinks to himself,\u00a0\u2018<i>Because screaming at Mr. Wilson for 30 minutes about eating chips on the couch counts as being a very busy man.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI have a question!\u201d Flash lazily raises his hand.<br/></p><p><i>\u2018Oh god&hellip;\u2019</i><br/></p><p>\u201cDoes a guy named Peter Parker have an internship here at The Stark Industries? Or more specifically, an internship where he helps Mr. Stark personally?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>The lady looks a little lost for a second before she answers\u00a0\u201cNo, we do not take high school students for internships anymore and when it comes to Mr. Stark I don\u2019t think he ever had anyone for an internship to help him. I\u2019ve never heard that name and I\u2019ve been here for a few years now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Flash\u2019s smug grows even wider as he turns his head to Peter\u00a0\u201cKnew it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m Spider-Man so shut the hell up. I\u2019m Spider-Man so shut the hell up. I\u2019m Spider-Man so-\u2019</i><br/></p><p>\u201cAlright then! If there are no other questions we can move on to the tour. Please follow me.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>They start walking to the factory door.<br/>Peter has been in there about a million times trying out new suits, webs, and weapons so the visit wasn\u2019t as exciting for him as for Ned and the others.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re gonna have the batons that Black Widow uses? Oh! Or The Iron Man Gauntlet?!\u201d Ned carelessly throws his phone in the metal box as an employee checks his ID card.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNot sure Ned&hellip;\u201d Peter shrugs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you think there will be any Spider-Man suits?\u201d his friend elbows him while they pass through the door.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDude! No! No Spider-Man talk here! One bad move and they figure it out and I\u2019m-\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFigure out what? That you\u2019re not actually friends with Spider-Man like you told us? Trust me&hellip; We figured that out a while ago.\u201d seems like Flash isn\u2019t going to let it go.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s like a tick. Once he sucks onto you it\u2019s hard to get him off.\u00a0</p><p>Peter turns to the annoying schoolmate but before he manages to get out a response he notices a familiar figure walking their way with a phone put to their ear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHappy! Happy it\u2019s me! Hey! It\u2019s me Peter!\u201d he waves his hand vigorously.</p><p>The moment the head of the security notices the loud young boy trying to get his attention he turns on his heel and walks away as fast as he can while shouting something into the phone.</p><p>\u201cHey! Okay! Fine! I\u2019ll see you later! Bye!\u201d Peter still shouts after him while standing on his tip-toes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Flash watches him with wide eyes\u00a0\u201cWow you\u2019re really going for it Parker. You wanna be a professional liar in the future?\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m Spider-Man so shut the hell-\u2019\u00a0\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying! I swear!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>\u201cThen prove it.\u201d</i>\u00a0<br/></p><p>It might have been because he didn\u2019t sleep all night that Flash was getting on his nerves so much today but Peter probably got the worst best idea how to shut him up for good.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine! When we get out of this factory to go to the next one we all stay in the middle of the crowd and on my sign you need to swoop to the left corridor and hide around the corner.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ned asks bluntly while they leave Flash behind.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Peter takes out a phone and starts furiously typing something.</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to leave our phones outside!\u201d Ned covers Peter as much as he can so that he won\u2019t get in trouble.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It doesn\u2019t have a camera see?\u201d he turns the phone around\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s filled with a lot of cool Sp-extra&hellip;stuff.\u201d Peter stops himself from mentioning anything Spidey related.\u00a0</p><p>After a few more minutes the lady announces they will be moving to another location.</p><p>\u201cI swear if we get caught Penis Parker I\u2019ll run you over with my car.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>Don\u2019t say it&hellip; Don\u2019t say it&hellip; Say something else! Anything!</i></p><p>\u201cWell, Flash I have health insurance!\u201d he quickly catches up to Ned.<br/></p><hr><p>When the time comes all three of them try to unnoticeably stumble to the left and once they are out of the crowd they start running to hide around the corner just like Peter told them to.\u00a0</p><p>They wait a minute until all the chatter passes\u00a0</p><p>Peter takes a glimpse into the hallway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Flash sounds more nervous than ever.<br/></p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Peter rushes to the hallway and takes a few turns to other corridors.<br/></p><p>The two boys barely know where they are at this point but after another minute they end up in front of a long staircase that seems to go on and on and on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStairs?\u201d Flash asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is the part you won\u2019t like.\u201d Peter takes the first staircase by two stairs at a time\u00a0\u201cWe have to walk all the way up on our feet.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Ned and Flash exchange looks and just for this one moment they both silently agree that they hate Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Peter has to pretend to be struggling throughout the long walk but it\u2019s actually not that hard.\u00a0</p><p>They made a bigger break when they hit the halfway.\u00a0</p><p>While Flash was too busy almost coughing out his lungs (since he tried to keep up with Peter who was going slow on them) Ned was lying on the ground and trying to calm down his beating heart. And then he noticed something on the ceilings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPe-Peter.\u201d he whispered still breathing heavily\u00a0\u201cL-look.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter looked the way Ned\u2019s finger pointed and he saw a camera that was installed in the corner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe&hellip;We\u2019re screwed&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI got it covered.\u201d Peter assures his friend.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow?!\u201d Ned sits up and blinks a few times because of all the red spots that form in front of him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry I got it.\u201d he shrugs \u201cI have a cool app on my phone that I got from Miss Romanoff. To my surprise, it was able to get through Mr. Starks security which came handy. I knew there were cameras here Ned. I wouldn\u2019t bring you here if I wasn\u2019t 100% sure these were off when we walk all those stairs.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow did it get through-you know what? I\u2019m too dizzy for this.\u201d Ned gives up and just sinks back to the ground for a few more minutes.<br/></p><p>After some more stairs and a few more stops, they finally get to the floor where the Avengers spend their free time training, working and socializing.\u00a0</p><p>Peter wraps his hand around the knob of the glass door and it takes his fingertips recognizing it\u2019s him. The doors open and the three boys slip inside very well knowing they have no right to be here right now.</p><p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d Flash barks.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to be very quick. Follow me.\u201d Peter starts sneaking around.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He was able to deactivate the cameras on the staircase but definitely not here.\u00a0</p><p>Before they even start walking they hear a loud thud and out of nowhere a manly figure drops from the ventilation shaft.\u00a0</p><p>Peter recognizes Clint Barton in seconds and stands frozen in place.</p><p>Clint looks at the group of boys with a very confused expression. Of course he recognized Peter but he didn\u2019t have a clue what the younging was doing here right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys seen Natasha?\u201d he asks after the fearful silence.<br/></p><p>Ned shakes his head and stares at the superhero in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>Clint looks behind them and nods\u00a0\u201cAlright. If you see her you don\u2019t know where I am and if someone asks me I have no clue you\u2019re here capish?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Ned and Flash nod their heads, terrified, that they got caught meanwhile Peter still stands paralyzed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Clint looks around again then runs around the corner and finally disappears.<br/></p><p>A few seconds pass.</p><p>\u201cDude! That was HAWKEYE!\u201d Ned starts freaking out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Flash stands there with his mouth open in pure shock.\u00a0</p><p>Peter blinks a few times and takes a deep breath. He went through a lot of scary stuff but this might have been the scariest of it all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, we gotta move. Come on.\u201d Peter\u2019s legs feel like jelly for a bit but after he takes a few steps it gets better.\u00a0</p><p>They are very careful each step they take.\u00a0</p><p>But failure is inevitable.\u00a0</p><p>Just one more turn and they would have been right where Peter wanted them to be but they had to run into someone in the hallway.</p><p>And this time it wasn\u2019t Clint.\u00a0<br/>It was way worse.</p><p>Ned\u2019s trembly voice whispers\u00a0\u201cDo we run?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter exhales \u201cIt would be pointless. He\u2019d catch us in a minute.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you boys doing here? I\u2019m pretty sure civilians are not allowed here.\u201d a clear solid voice speaks up.<br/></p><p>\u201cMr. Rogers I-\u201d Peter tries to explain the situation.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know what? Save it, son.\u201d Steve raises his hand\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not the one you\u2019ll have to explain this to.\u201d he nods his head for them to start walking\u00a0\u201cAnd don\u2019t try to run away he was right. It would be pointless.\u201d he warns the kids.<br/></p><p>Ned whispers toward Peter\u00a0\u201cDude, Captain America just called you son!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know Ned I\u2019m freaking out too.\u201d Peter had to try and calm his heart rate a bit.<br/></p><p>He might have hung out with Steve Rogers a few times but this was still very new to him. And he was a huge fanboy.</p><p>\u201cI swear you\u2019re fucking dead Parker.\u201d Flash grunts when Steve knocks on huge doors from dark wood.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The doors open after a few seconds and they all walk in.\u00a0<br/>It\u2019s a big boardroom with the perfect view on New York.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys wait here I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>The door closes again practically sealing their fate and the boys exchange terrified looks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fucking fault Penis Parker!\u201d Flash finally bursts out\u00a0\u201cI knew this was going to end badly and I swear if I get in trouble for it I\u2019ll make the rest of your life a living hell!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t listen to Flash because he\u2019s already worried sick how he\u2019s going to explain this.\u00a0</p><p>A few minutes of Flash aggressively shouting pass and the door finally opens to reveal Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.</p><p>Both Ned and Flash swallow loudly and stand straight as rulers.\u00a0<br/>Peter just looks down in shame.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d Tony Stark points at Flash and Ned\u00a0\u201cout. Captain Rogers will escort you back to your class. And please tell the teacher that Peter Parker isn\u2019t going to be joining you back any time soon. I have to chat with my&hellip; assistant here.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMr. Stark I-\u201d Peter tries again.<br/></p><p>\u201cAbaba!\u201d Tony raises his hand\u00a0\u201cSave it kid. You two,\u201d he points at the two schoolmates again \u201cSkidaddle.\u201d.<br/></p><p>Both of them head out of the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Tony turns around and looks at the boys standing next to Cap\u00a0\u201cAnd next time before you start insulting and bullying someone I\u2019d check if there aren\u2019t any cameras around to catch you doing it Eugene Thompson.\u201d his voice hardens.</p><p>Flash stares at Tony wide-eyed\u00a0\u201cI&hellip;I-\u201d before he can finish his sentence the doors close.</p><p>Tony turns to Peter squinting his eyes at him\u00a0\u201cHow did your brain actually manage to come up with something so unbelievably stupid?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry Mr. Stark it\u2019s just&hellip; He wouldn\u2019t stop messing with me about the internship. They all think it\u2019s not real and I know I shouldn\u2019t care and most of the time I just ignore them but I just couldn\u2019t today&hellip; I was terrified of this trip and then when he was mocking me I-\u201d Peter rants and Tony sees that he starts breathing very fast.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Pete.\u201d he puts his hand on his shoulder\u00a0\u201cNothing bad happened nobody got hurt. You just probably had to walk a lot of stairs I can imagine.\u201d Tony pulls a chair for Peter to sit on\u00a0\u201cHow were you planning to prove that your internship was real?\u201d he asks out of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to show them the lab.\u201d Peter notices how red with anger Tony goes after he says that\u00a0\u201cBut just for a minute! I know there is a lot of dangerous stuff there, I know! But I would just show them the suits behind the glass and that I know the code to the room and then we\u2019d just leave I swear Mr.Stark!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>A few dreadful seconds for Peter pass.</p><p>\u201cLook. I understand. Steve told me what he heard the guy say to you and he tactically brought you in the boardroom instead of my office so that he could really see what was going on.\u201d Tony explains\u00a0\u201cWe both know you\u2019re a good kid and that you wouldn\u2019t do this to hurt anyone but we needed to find a reason why we shouldn\u2019t take your ID and forbid you from ever going here again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter ruffles his hair feeling the guilt wash over him again.</p><p>\u201cThe next time someone bullies you like that I want you to tell your aunt, the teacher or<i> me</i>. <i>I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\u00a0</i>he pats his shoulder<i> \u201c</i>I know it\u2019s not that easy but it\u2019s always a bit easier when you can face it with the help of others&hellip; But you\u2019re still an idiot Peter. Don\u2019t <i>ever </i>do this again. And as punishment, you have to go and tell Natasha where Clint is.\u201d Tony gets up from his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asks confused.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dumb I checked all the cameras. I saw Clint just letting you wander around here. Your punishment will be that you will betray your pact with Clint and Clint\u2019s punishment will be the wrath of Natasha and trust me&hellip; There is nothing worse in the world.\u201d Tony\u2019s body shakes while he thinks of some kind of past experience with the assassin\u00a0\u201cYou can be happy I\u2019m not making a big deal out of this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter was so scared that Tony might take his ID card or his suit again but seeing so much understanding from an adult like him was refreshing. <br/></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</i> he quickly wraps his hands around him in a tight hug.\u00a0</p><p>Tony stands frozen for a bit, surprised at the sudden affection.</p><p>He slowly wraps his hands around Peter too <i>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome kid.\u201d\u00a0</i></p>",

Do you have any questions\u00a0before we go there?\u201d a well put together middle-aged lady jotted down something on a tablet and looked at the crowd of kids again.<br></p><p>A short girl - Peter barely knew her from Spanish class but she was one of the nice ones - raised her hand high.\u00a0<br>The woman nodded her way encouraging her to speak.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to meet Ms. Potts?\u201d she squeals in excitement.</p><p>\u201cOr any of the Avengers? Iron Man?!\u201d someone from the back shouts.<br></p><p>\u201cUnfortunately no. Ms. Potts is on a business trip at this moment and Mr. Stark is a very busy man. The other superheroes have a lot of their own missions and things to do.\u201d the lady explains as politely as possible.</p><p><i>\u2018Yeah sure.\u2019 </i>Peter thinks to himself,\u00a0\u2018<i>Because screaming at Mr. Wilson for 30 minutes about eating chips on the couch counts as being a very busy man.\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI have a question!\u201d Flash lazily raises his hand.<br></p><p><i>\u2018Oh god\u2026\u2019</i><br></p><p>\u201cDoes a guy named Peter Parker have an internship here at The Stark Industries? Or more specifically, an internship where he helps Mr. Stark personally?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>The lady looks a little lost for a second before she answers\u00a0\u201cNo, we do not take high school students for internships anymore and when it comes to Mr. Stark I don\u2019t think he ever had anyone for an internship to help him. I\u2019ve never heard that name and I\u2019ve been here for a few years now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Flash\u2019s smug grows even wider as he turns his head to Peter\u00a0\u201cKnew it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m Spider-Man so shut the hell up.

Please follow me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>They start walking to the factory door.<br>Peter has been in there about a million times trying out new suits, webs, and weapons so the visit wasn\u2019t as exciting for him as for Ned and the others.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re gonna have the batons that Black Widow uses? Oh! Or The Iron Man Gauntlet?!\u201d Ned carelessly throws his phone in the metal box as an employee checks his ID card.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot sure Ned\u2026\u201d Peter shrugs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDo you think there will be any Spider-Man suits?\u201d his friend elbows him while they pass through the door.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDude! No! No Spider-Man talk here! One bad move and they figure it out and I\u2019m-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFigure out what? That you\u2019re not actually friends with Spider-Man like you told us? Trust me\u2026 We figured that out a while ago.\u201d seems like Flash isn\u2019t going to let it go.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s like a tick. Once he sucks onto you it\u2019s hard to get him off.\u00a0</p><p>Peter turns to the annoying schoolmate but before he manages to get out a response he notices a familiar figure walking their way with a phone put to their ear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHappy! Happy it\u2019s me! Hey! It\u2019s me Peter!\u201d he waves his hand vigorously.</p><p>The moment the head of the security notices the loud young boy trying to get his attention he turns on his heel and walks away as fast as he can while shouting something into the phone.</p><p>\u201cHey! Okay! Fine! I\u2019ll see you later! Bye!\u201d Peter still shouts after him while standing on his tip-toes.\u00a0<br></p><p>Flash watches him with wide eyes\u00a0\u201cWow you\u2019re really going for it Parker. You wanna be a professional liar in the future?\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>\u2018I\u2019m Spider-Man so shut the hell-\u2019\u00a0\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying!

When we get out of this factory to go to the next one we all stay in the middle of the crowd and on my sign you need to swoop to the left corridor and hide around the corner.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ned asks bluntly while they leave Flash behind.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Peter takes out a phone and starts furiously typing something.</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to leave our phones outside!\u201d Ned covers Peter as much as he can so that he won\u2019t get in trouble.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It doesn\u2019t have a camera see?\u201d he turns the phone around\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s filled with a lot of cool Sp-extra\u2026stuff.\u201d Peter stops himself from mentioning anything Spidey related.\u00a0</p><p>After a few more minutes the lady announces they will be moving to another location.</p><p>\u201cI swear if we get caught Penis Parker I\u2019ll run you over with my car.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><i>Don\u2019t say it\u2026 Don\u2019t say it\u2026 Say something else! Anything!</i></p><p>\u201cWell, Flash I have health insurance!\u201d he quickly catches up to Ned.<br></p><hr><p>When the time comes all three of them try to unnoticeably stumble to the left and once they are out of the crowd they start running to hide around the corner just like Peter told them to.\u00a0</p><p>They wait a minute until all the chatter passes\u00a0</p><p>Peter takes a glimpse into the hallway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Flash sounds more nervous than ever.<br></p><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Peter rushes to the hallway and takes a few turns to other corridors.<br></p><p>The two boys barely know where they are at this point but after another minute they end up in front of a long staircase that seems to go on and on and on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cStairs?\u201d Flash asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThis is the part you won\u2019t like.\u201d Peter takes the first staircase by two stairs at a time\u00a0\u201cWe have to walk all the way up on our feet.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Ned and Flash exchange looks and just for this one moment they both silently agree that they hate Peter.\u00a0</p><p>Peter has to pretend to be struggling throughout the long walk but it\u2019s actually not that hard.\u00a0</p><p>They made a bigger break when they hit the halfway.\u00a0</p><p>While Flash was too busy almost coughing out his lungs (since he tried to keep up with Peter who was going slow on them) Ned was lying on the ground and trying to calm down his beating heart. And then he noticed something on the ceilings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPe-Peter.\u201d he whispered still breathing heavily\u00a0\u201cL-look.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter looked the way Ned\u2019s finger pointed and he saw a camera that was installed in the corner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026We\u2019re screwed\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI got it covered.\u201d Peter assures his friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow?!\u201d Ned sits up and blinks a few times because of all the red spots that form in front of him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry I got it.\u201d he shrugs \u201cI have a cool app on my phone that I got from Miss Romanoff. To my surprise, it was able to get through Mr. Starks security which came handy. I knew there were cameras here Ned. I wouldn\u2019t bring you here if I wasn\u2019t 100% sure these were off when we walk all those stairs.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow did it get through-you know what? I\u2019m too dizzy for this.\u201d Ned gives up and just sinks back to the ground for a few more minutes.<br></p><p>After some more stairs and a few more stops, they finally get to the floor where the Avengers spend their free time training, working and socializing.\u00a0</p><p>Peter wraps his hand around the knob of the glass door and it takes his fingertips recognizing it\u2019s him. The doors open and the three boys slip inside very well knowing they have no right to be here right now.</p><p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d Flash barks.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to be very quick. Follow me.\u201d Peter starts sneaking around.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was able to deactivate the cameras on the staircase but definitely not here.\u00a0</p><p>Before they even start walking they hear a loud thud and out of nowhere a manly figure drops from the ventilation shaft.\u00a0</p><p>Peter recognizes Clint Barton in seconds and stands frozen in place.</p><p>Clint looks at the group of boys with a very confused expression. Of course he recognized Peter but he didn\u2019t have a clue what the younging was doing here right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys seen Natasha?\u201d he asks after the fearful silence.<br></p><p>Ned shakes his head and stares at the superhero in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>Clint looks behind them and nods\u00a0\u201cAlright. If you see her you don\u2019t know where I am and if someone asks me I have no clue you\u2019re here capish?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Ned and Flash nod their heads, terrified, that they got caught meanwhile Peter still stands paralyzed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Clint looks around again then runs around the corner and finally disappears.<br></p><p>A few seconds pass.</p><p>\u201cDude! That was HAWKEYE!\u201d Ned starts freaking out.\u00a0<br></p><p>Flash stands there with his mouth open in pure shock.\u00a0</p><p>Peter blinks a few times and takes a deep breath. He went through a lot of scary stuff but this might have been the scariest of it all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, we gotta move. Come on.\u201d Peter\u2019s legs feel like jelly for a bit but after he takes a few steps it gets better.\u00a0</p><p>They are very careful each step they take.\u00a0</p><p>But failure is inevitable.\u00a0</p><p>Just one more turn and they would have been right where Peter wanted them to be but they had to run into someone in the hallway.</p><p>And this time it wasn\u2019t Clint.\u00a0<br>It was way worse.</p><p>Ned\u2019s trembly voice whispers\u00a0\u201cDo we run?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter exhales \u201cIt would be pointless. He\u2019d catch us in a minute.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you boys doing here? I\u2019m pretty sure civilians are not allowed here.\u201d a clear solid voice speaks up.<br></p><p>\u201cMr. Rogers I-\u201d Peter tries to explain the situation.<br></p><p>\u201cYou know what? Save it, son.\u201d Steve raises his hand\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not the one you\u2019ll have to explain this to.\u201d he nods his head for them to start walking\u00a0\u201cAnd don\u2019t try to run away he was right. It would be pointless.\u201d he warns the kids.<br></p><p>Ned whispers toward Peter\u00a0\u201cDude, Captain America just called you son!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know Ned I\u2019m freaking out too.\u201d Peter had to try and calm his heart rate a bit.<br></p><p>He might have hung out with Steve Rogers a few times but this was still very new to him. And he was a huge fanboy.</p><p>\u201cI swear you\u2019re fucking dead Parker.\u201d Flash grunts when Steve knocks on huge doors from dark wood.\u00a0<br></p><p>The doors open after a few seconds and they all walk in.\u00a0<br>It\u2019s a big boardroom with the perfect view on New York.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys wait here I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>The door closes again practically sealing their fate and the boys exchange terrified looks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fucking fault Penis Parker!\u201d Flash finally bursts out\u00a0\u201cI knew this was going to end badly and I swear if I get in trouble for it I\u2019ll make the rest of your life a living hell!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t listen to Flash because he\u2019s already worried sick how he\u2019s going to explain this.\u00a0</p><p>A few minutes of Flash aggressively shouting pass and the door finally opens to reveal Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.</p><p>Both Ned and Flash swallow loudly and stand straight as rulers.\u00a0<br>Peter just looks down in shame.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d Tony Stark points at Flash and Ned\u00a0\u201cout. Captain Rogers will escort you back to your class. And please tell the teacher that Peter Parker isn\u2019t going to be joining you back any time soon. I have to chat with my\u2026 assistant here.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMr. Stark I-\u201d Peter tries again.<br></p><p>\u201cAbaba!\u201d Tony raises his hand\u00a0\u201cSave it kid. You two,\u201d he points at the two schoolmates again \u201cSkidaddle.\u201d.<br></p><p>Both of them head out of the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Tony turns around and looks at the boys standing next to Cap\u00a0\u201cAnd next time before you start insulting and bullying someone I\u2019d check if there aren\u2019t any cameras around to catch you doing it Eugene Thompson.\u201d his voice hardens.</p><p>Flash stares at Tony wide-eyed\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I-\u201d before he can finish his sentence the doors close.</p><p>Tony turns to Peter squinting his eyes at him\u00a0\u201cHow did your brain actually manage to come up with something so unbelievably stupid?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry Mr. Stark it\u2019s just\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t stop messing with me about the internship. They all think it\u2019s not real and I know I shouldn\u2019t care and most of the time I just ignore them but I just couldn\u2019t today\u2026 I was terrified of this trip and then when he was mocking me I-\u201d Peter rants and Tony sees that he starts breathing very fast.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Pete.\u201d he puts his hand on his shoulder\u00a0\u201cNothing bad happened nobody got hurt. You just probably had to walk a lot of stairs I can imagine.\u201d Tony pulls a chair for Peter to sit on\u00a0\u201cHow were you planning to prove that your internship was real?\u201d he asks out of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to show them the lab.\u201d Peter notices how red with anger Tony goes after he says that\u00a0\u201cBut just for a minute! I know there is a lot of dangerous stuff there, I know! But I would just show them the suits behind the glass and that I know the code to the room and then we\u2019d just leave I swear Mr.Stark!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>A few dreadful seconds for Peter pass.</p><p>\u201cLook. I understand. Steve told me what he heard the guy say to you and he tactically brought you in the boardroom instead of my office so that he could really see what was going on.\u201d Tony explains\u00a0\u201cWe both know you\u2019re a good kid and that you wouldn\u2019t do this to hurt anyone but we needed to find a reason why we shouldn\u2019t take your ID and forbid you from ever going here again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter ruffles his hair feeling the guilt wash over him again.</p><p>\u201cThe next time someone bullies you like that I want you to tell your aunt, the teacher or<i> me</i>. <i>I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\u00a0</i>he pats his shoulder<i> \u201c</i>I know it\u2019s not that easy but it\u2019s always a bit easier when you can face it with the help of others\u2026 But you\u2019re still an idiot Peter. Don\u2019t <i>ever </i>do this again. And as punishment, you have to go and tell Natasha where Clint is.\u201d Tony gets up from his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asks confused.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dumb I checked all the cameras. I saw Clint just letting you wander around here. Your punishment will be that you will betray your pact with Clint and Clint\u2019s punishment will be the wrath of Natasha and trust me\u2026 There is nothing worse in the world.\u201d Tony\u2019s body shakes while he thinks of some kind of past experience with the assassin\u00a0\u201cYou can be happy I\u2019m not making a big deal out of this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter was so scared that Tony might take his ID card or his suit again but seeing so much understanding from an adult like him was refreshing. <br></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</i> he quickly wraps his hands around him in a tight hug.\u00a0</p><p>Tony stands frozen for a bit, surprised at the sudden affection.</p><p>He slowly wraps his hands around Peter too <i>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome kid.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></p>",

And then he noticed something on the ceilings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPe-Peter.\u201d he whispered still breathing heavily\u00a0\u201cL-look.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter looked the way Ned\u2019s finger pointed and he saw a camera that was installed in the corner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2026We\u2019re screwed\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI got it covered.\u201d Peter assures his friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow?!\u201d Ned sits up and blinks a few times because of all the red spots that form in front of him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry I got it.\u201d he shrugs \u201cI have a cool app on my phone that I got from Miss Romanoff. To my surprise, it was able to get through Mr. Starks security which came handy. I knew there were cameras here Ned. I wouldn\u2019t bring you here if I wasn\u2019t 100% sure these were off when we walk all those stairs.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow did it get through-you know what? I\u2019m too dizzy for this.\u201d Ned gives up and just sinks back to the ground for a few more minutes.<br></p><p>After some more stairs and a few more stops, they finally get to the floor where the Avengers spend their free time training, working and socializing.\u00a0</p><p>Peter wraps his hand around the knob of the glass door and it takes his fingertips recognizing it\u2019s him. The doors open and the three boys slip inside very well knowing they have no right to be here right now.</p><p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d Flash barks.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to be very quick. Follow me.\u201d Peter starts sneaking around.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was able to deactivate the cameras on the staircase but definitely not here.\u00a0</p><p>Before they even start walking they hear a loud thud and out of nowhere a manly figure drops from the ventilation shaft.\u00a0</p><p>Peter recognizes Clint Barton in seconds and stands frozen in place.</p><p>Clint looks at the group of boys with a very confused expression. Of course he recognized Peter but he didn\u2019t have a clue what the younging was doing here right now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys seen Natasha?\u201d he asks after the fearful silence.<br></p><p>Ned shakes his head and stares at the superhero in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>Clint looks behind them and nods\u00a0\u201cAlright. If you see her you don\u2019t know where I am and if someone asks me I have no clue you\u2019re here capish?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Ned and Flash nod their heads, terrified, that they got caught meanwhile Peter still stands paralyzed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Clint looks around again then runs around the corner and finally disappears.<br></p><p>A few seconds pass.</p><p>\u201cDude! That was HAWKEYE!\u201d Ned starts freaking out.\u00a0<br></p><p>Flash stands there with his mouth open in pure shock.\u00a0</p><p>Peter blinks a few times and takes a deep breath. He went through a lot of scary stuff but this might have been the scariest of it all.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, we gotta move. Come on.\u201d Peter\u2019s legs feel like jelly for a bit but after he takes a few steps it gets better.\u00a0</p><p>They are very careful each step they take.\u00a0</p><p>But failure is inevitable.\u00a0</p><p>Just one more turn and they would have been right where Peter wanted them to be but they had to run into someone in the hallway.</p><p>And this time it wasn\u2019t Clint.\u00a0<br>It was way worse.</p><p>Ned\u2019s trembly voice whispers\u00a0\u201cDo we run?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter exhales \u201cIt would be pointless. He\u2019d catch us in a minute.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you boys doing here? I\u2019m pretty sure civilians are not allowed here.\u201d a clear solid voice speaks up.<br></p><p>\u201cMr. Rogers I-\u201d Peter tries to explain the situation.<br></p><p>\u201cYou know what? Save it, son.\u201d Steve raises his hand\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not the one you\u2019ll have to explain this to.\u201d he nods his head for them to start walking\u00a0\u201cAnd don\u2019t try to run away he was right. It would be pointless.\u201d he warns the kids.<br></p><p>Ned whispers toward Peter\u00a0\u201cDude, Captain America just called you son!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know Ned I\u2019m freaking out too.\u201d Peter had to try and calm his heart rate a bit.<br></p><p>He might have hung out with Steve Rogers a few times but this was still very new to him. And he was a huge fanboy.</p><p>\u201cI swear you\u2019re fucking dead Parker.\u201d Flash grunts when Steve knocks on huge doors from dark wood.\u00a0<br></p><p>The doors open after a few seconds and they all walk in.\u00a0<br>It\u2019s a big boardroom with the perfect view on New York.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys wait here I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>The door closes again practically sealing their fate and the boys exchange terrified looks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fucking fault Penis Parker!\u201d Flash finally bursts out\u00a0\u201cI knew this was going to end badly and I swear if I get in trouble for it I\u2019ll make the rest of your life a living hell!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t listen to Flash because he\u2019s already worried sick how he\u2019s going to explain this.\u00a0</p><p>A few minutes of Flash aggressively shouting pass and the door finally opens to reveal Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.</p><p>Both Ned and Flash swallow loudly and stand straight as rulers.\u00a0<br>Peter just looks down in shame.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d Tony Stark points at Flash and Ned\u00a0\u201cout. Captain Rogers will escort you back to your class. And please tell the teacher that Peter Parker isn\u2019t going to be joining you back any time soon. I have to chat with my\u2026 assistant here.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMr. Stark I-\u201d Peter tries again.<br></p><p>\u201cAbaba!\u201d Tony raises his hand\u00a0\u201cSave it kid. You two,\u201d he points at the two schoolmates again \u201cSkidaddle.\u201d.<br></p><p>Both of them head out of the room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Tony turns around and looks at the boys standing next to Cap\u00a0\u201cAnd next time before you start insulting and bullying someone I\u2019d check if there aren\u2019t any cameras around to catch you doing it Eugene Thompson.\u201d his voice hardens.</p><p>Flash stares at Tony wide-eyed\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I-\u201d before he can finish his sentence the doors close.</p><p>Tony turns to Peter squinting his eyes at him\u00a0\u201cHow did your brain actually manage to come up with something so unbelievably stupid?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry Mr. Stark it\u2019s just\u2026 He wouldn\u2019t stop messing with me about the internship. They all think it\u2019s not real and I know I shouldn\u2019t care and most of the time I just ignore them but I just couldn\u2019t today\u2026 I was terrified of this trip and then when he was mocking me I-\u201d Peter rants and Tony sees that he starts breathing very fast.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright Pete.\u201d he puts his hand on his shoulder\u00a0\u201cNothing bad happened nobody got hurt. You just probably had to walk a lot of stairs I can imagine.\u201d Tony pulls a chair for Peter to sit on\u00a0\u201cHow were you planning to prove that your internship was real?\u201d he asks out of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to show them the lab.\u201d Peter notices how red with anger Tony goes after he says that\u00a0\u201cBut just for a minute! I know there is a lot of dangerous stuff there, I know! But I would just show them the suits behind the glass and that I know the code to the room and then we\u2019d just leave I swear Mr.Stark!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>A few dreadful seconds for Peter pass.</p><p>\u201cLook. I understand. Steve told me what he heard the guy say to you and he tactically brought you in the boardroom instead of my office so that he could really see what was going on.\u201d Tony explains\u00a0\u201cWe both know you\u2019re a good kid and that you wouldn\u2019t do this to hurt anyone but we needed to find a reason why we shouldn\u2019t take your ID and forbid you from ever going here again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter ruffles his hair feeling the guilt wash over him again.</p><p>\u201cThe next time someone bullies you like that I want you to tell your aunt, the teacher or<i> me</i>. <i>I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\u00a0</i>he pats his shoulder<i> \u201c</i>I know it\u2019s not that easy but it\u2019s always a bit easier when you can face it with the help of others\u2026 But you\u2019re still an idiot Peter. Don\u2019t <i>ever </i>do this again. And as punishment, you have to go and tell Natasha where Clint is.\u201d Tony gets up from his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asks confused.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dumb I checked all the cameras. I saw Clint just letting you wander around here. Your punishment will be that you will betray your pact with Clint and Clint\u2019s punishment will be the wrath of Natasha and trust me\u2026 There is nothing worse in the world.\u201d Tony\u2019s body shakes while he thinks of some kind of past experience with the assassin\u00a0\u201cYou can be happy I\u2019m not making a big deal out of this.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter was so scared that Tony might take his ID card or his suit again but seeing so much understanding from an adult like him was refreshing. <br></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</i> he quickly wraps his hands around him in a tight hug.\u00a0</p><p>Tony stands frozen for a bit, surprised at the sudden affection.</p><p>He slowly wraps his hands around Peter too <i>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome kid.\u201d\u00a0</i></p></p>",

It doesn&rsquo;t have a camera see?&rdquo; he turns the phone around&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s filled with a lot of cool Sp-extra&hellip;stuff.&rdquo; Peter stops himself from mentioning anything Spidey related.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few more minutes the lady announces they will be moving to another location.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear if we get caught Penis Parker I&rsquo;ll run you over with my car.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t say it&hellip; Don&rsquo;t say it&hellip; Say something else! Anything!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Well, Flash I have health insurance!&rdquo; he quickly catches up to Ned.<br /></p><hr /><p>When the time comes all three of them try to unnoticeably stumble to the left and once they are out of the crowd they start running to hide around the corner just like Peter told them to.&nbsp;</p><p>They wait a minute until all the chatter passes&nbsp;</p><p>Peter takes a glimpse into the hallway.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Flash sounds more nervous than ever.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; Peter rushes to the hallway and takes a few turns to other corridors.<br /></p><p>The two boys barely know where they are at this point but after another minute they end up in front of a long staircase that seems to go on and on and on.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stairs?&rdquo; Flash asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This is the part you won&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Peter takes the first staircase by two stairs at a time&nbsp;&ldquo;We have to walk all the way up on our feet.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Ned and Flash exchange looks and just for this one moment they both silently agree that they hate Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter has to pretend to be struggling throughout the long walk but it&rsquo;s actually not that hard.&nbsp;</p><p>They made a bigger break when they hit the halfway.&nbsp;</p><p>While Flash was too busy almost coughing out his lungs (since he tried to keep up with Peter who was going slow on them) Ned was lying on the ground and trying to calm down his beating heart. And then he noticed something on the ceilings.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Pe-Peter.&rdquo; he whispered still breathing heavily&nbsp;&ldquo;L-look.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Peter looked the way Ned&rsquo;s finger pointed and he saw a camera that was installed in the corner.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&hellip;We&rsquo;re screwed&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I got it covered.&rdquo; Peter assures his friend.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How?!&rdquo; Ned sits up and blinks a few times because of all the red spots that form in front of him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry I got it.&rdquo; he shrugs &ldquo;I have a cool app on my phone that I got from Miss Romanoff. To my surprise, it was able to get through Mr. Starks security which came handy. I knew there were cameras here Ned. I wouldn&rsquo;t bring you here if I wasn&rsquo;t 100% sure these were off when we walk all those stairs.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How did it get through-you know what? I&rsquo;m too dizzy for this.&rdquo; Ned gives up and just sinks back to the ground for a few more minutes.<br /></p><p>After some more stairs and a few more stops, they finally get to the floor where the Avengers spend their free time training, working and socializing.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter wraps his hand around the knob of the glass door and it takes his fingertips recognizing it&rsquo;s him. The doors open and the three boys slip inside very well knowing they have no right to be here right now.</p><p>&ldquo;So now what?&rdquo; Flash barks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be very quick. Follow me.&rdquo; Peter starts sneaking around.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He was able to deactivate the cameras on the staircase but definitely not here.&nbsp;</p><p>Before they even start walking they hear a loud thud and out of nowhere a manly figure drops from the ventilation shaft.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter recognizes Clint Barton in seconds and stands frozen in place.</p><p>Clint looks at the group of boys with a very confused expression. Of course he recognized Peter but he didn&rsquo;t have a clue what the younging was doing here right now.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys seen Natasha?&rdquo; he asks after the fearful silence.<br /></p><p>Ned shakes his head and stares at the superhero in front of him.&nbsp;</p><p>Clint looks behind them and nods&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright. If you see her you don&rsquo;t know where I am and if someone asks me I have no clue you&rsquo;re here capish?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Ned and Flash nod their heads, terrified, that they got caught meanwhile Peter still stands paralyzed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Clint looks around again then runs around the corner and finally disappears.<br /></p><p>A few seconds pass.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude! That was HAWKEYE!&rdquo; Ned starts freaking out.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Flash stands there with his mouth open in pure shock.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter blinks a few times and takes a deep breath. He went through a lot of scary stuff but this might have been the scariest of it all.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, we gotta move. Come on.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s legs feel like jelly for a bit but after he takes a few steps it gets better.&nbsp;</p><p>They are very careful each step they take.&nbsp;</p><p>But failure is inevitable.&nbsp;</p><p>Just one more turn and they would have been right where Peter wanted them to be but they had to run into someone in the hallway.</p><p>And this time it wasn&rsquo;t Clint.&nbsp;<br />It was way worse.</p><p>Ned&rsquo;s trembly voice whispers&nbsp;&ldquo;Do we run?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Peter exhales &ldquo;It would be pointless. He&rsquo;d catch us in a minute.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you boys doing here? I&rsquo;m pretty sure civilians are not allowed here.&rdquo; a clear solid voice speaks up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Rogers I-&rdquo; Peter tries to explain the situation.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know what? Save it, son.&rdquo; Steve raises his hand&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the one you&rsquo;ll have to explain this to.&rdquo; he nods his head for them to start walking&nbsp;&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t try to run away he was right. It would be pointless.&rdquo; he warns the kids.<br /></p><p>Ned whispers toward Peter&nbsp;&ldquo;Dude, Captain America just called you son!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know Ned I&rsquo;m freaking out too.&rdquo; Peter had to try and calm his heart rate a bit.<br /></p><p>He might have hung out with Steve Rogers a few times but this was still very new to him. And he was a huge fanboy.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear you&rsquo;re fucking dead Parker.&rdquo; Flash grunts when Steve knocks on huge doors from dark wood.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The doors open after a few seconds and they all walk in.&nbsp;<br />It&rsquo;s a big boardroom with the perfect view on New York.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys wait here I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The door closes again practically sealing their fate and the boys exchange terrified looks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your fucking fault Penis Parker!&rdquo; Flash finally bursts out&nbsp;&ldquo;I knew this was going to end badly and I swear if I get in trouble for it I&rsquo;ll make the rest of your life a living hell!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t listen to Flash because he&rsquo;s already worried sick how he&rsquo;s going to explain this.&nbsp;</p><p>A few minutes of Flash aggressively shouting pass and the door finally opens to reveal Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.</p><p>Both Ned and Flash swallow loudly and stand straight as rulers.&nbsp;<br />Peter just looks down in shame.</p><p>&ldquo;You two,&rdquo; Tony Stark points at Flash and Ned&nbsp;&ldquo;out. Captain Rogers will escort you back to your class. And please tell the teacher that Peter Parker isn&rsquo;t going to be joining you back any time soon. I have to chat with my&hellip; assistant here.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark I-&rdquo; Peter tries again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ababa!&rdquo; Tony raises his hand&nbsp;&ldquo;Save it kid. You two,&rdquo; he points at the two schoolmates again &ldquo;Skidaddle.&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>Both of them head out of the room.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Tony turns around and looks at the boys standing next to Cap&nbsp;&ldquo;And next time before you start insulting and bullying someone I&rsquo;d check if there aren&rsquo;t any cameras around to catch you doing it Eugene Thompson.&rdquo; his voice hardens.</p><p>Flash stares at Tony wide-eyed&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip;I-&rdquo; before he can finish his sentence the doors close.</p><p>Tony turns to Peter squinting his eyes at him&nbsp;&ldquo;How did your brain actually manage to come up with something so unbelievably stupid?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I am so sorry Mr. Stark it&rsquo;s just&hellip; He wouldn&rsquo;t stop messing with me about the internship. They all think it&rsquo;s not real and I know I shouldn&rsquo;t care and most of the time I just ignore them but I just couldn&rsquo;t today&hellip; I was terrified of this trip and then when he was mocking me I-&rdquo; Peter rants and Tony sees that he starts breathing very fast.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright Pete.&rdquo; he puts his hand on his shoulder&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing bad happened nobody got hurt. You just probably had to walk a lot of stairs I can imagine.&rdquo; Tony pulls a chair for Peter to sit on&nbsp;&ldquo;How were you planning to prove that your internship was real?&rdquo; he asks out of curiosity.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to show them the lab.&rdquo; Peter notices how red with anger Tony goes after he says that&nbsp;&ldquo;But just for a minute! I know there is a lot of dangerous stuff there, I know! But I would just show them the suits behind the glass and that I know the code to the room and then we&rsquo;d just leave I swear Mr.Stark!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>A few dreadful seconds for Peter pass.</p><p>&ldquo;Look. I understand. Steve told me what he heard the guy say to you and he tactically brought you in the boardroom instead of my office so that he could really see what was going on.&rdquo; Tony explains&nbsp;&ldquo;We both know you&rsquo;re a good kid and that you wouldn&rsquo;t do this to hurt anyone but we needed to find a reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t take your ID and forbid you from ever going here again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Peter ruffles his hair feeling the guilt wash over him again.</p><p>&ldquo;The next time someone bullies you like that I want you to tell your aunt, the teacher or<i> me</i>. <i>I&rsquo;ll deal with it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>he pats his shoulder<i> &ldquo;</i>I know it&rsquo;s not that easy but it&rsquo;s always a bit easier when you can face it with the help of others&hellip; But you&rsquo;re still an idiot Peter. Don&rsquo;t <i>ever </i>do this again. And as punishment, you have to go and tell Natasha where Clint is.&rdquo; Tony gets up from his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Peter asks confused.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dumb I checked all the cameras. I saw Clint just letting you wander around here. Your punishment will be that you will betray your pact with Clint and Clint&rsquo;s punishment will be the wrath of Natasha and trust me&hellip; There is nothing worse in the world.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s body shakes while he thinks of some kind of past experience with the assassin&nbsp;&ldquo;You can be happy I&rsquo;m not making a big deal out of this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Peter was so scared that Tony might take his ID card or his suit again but seeing so much understanding from an adult like him was refreshing. <br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Stark.&rdquo;</i> he quickly wraps his hands around him in a tight hug.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony stands frozen for a bit, surprised at the sudden affection.</p><p>He slowly wraps his hands around Peter too <i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome kid.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p></p>",

But it&rsquo;s not a formal occasion, it&rsquo;s Pepper upstairs in the dining room with a bottle of wine and something in takeout boxes.&nbsp; Well, Pepper would use plates.&nbsp; Probably china from the cabinet in the hall.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d call the restaurant ahead of time and tell them not to include plastic cutlery in the pickup order.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s good like that.</p><p>But Tony&rsquo;s good too.&nbsp; He knows it takes him an average of 17 minutes to disassemble, weld, and reassemble one of the pulsar weapons on the palms of his gloves.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s timed himself.&nbsp; So multiply by two, add a few more for the inevitable distraction, and he&rsquo;s at&hellip;45?&nbsp; Ish?&nbsp; He has time.</p><p>He&rsquo;s deep in the zone, welding mask pulled low over his face, when FRIDAY interrupts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Incoming call from Miss Potts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, soon, almost done,&rdquo; Tony says automatically.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t looked up since he got to the lab bench.&nbsp; He has no idea how much time has passed, but he&rsquo;s still on-task.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not off on a tangent, which, to him, amounts to success.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t last, though.&nbsp; The second weld goes wrong, and the pulsar beam shoots out at an angle.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only 5 degrees off or so, but that&rsquo;ll never do.&nbsp; Tony thinks about walking away, tackling it later, making the right choice.&nbsp; But he can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He spends the next 10 minutes making excuses to himself as he uses tweezers to separate all the moving parts in the glove and lay them in rows on the lab bench.&nbsp; If he leaves the project unfinished, he won&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.&nbsp; Pepper will talk to him, and he won&rsquo;t be listening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better if he&rsquo;s late for dinner and able to give her his full attention.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll appreciate that.&nbsp; Or at least he thinks she should.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Potts is ringing again,&rdquo; FRIDAY says.</p><p>&ldquo;Who did your speech drive?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tony sets down his tools.&nbsp; &ldquo;I gave you the accent, but we don&rsquo;t say that this side of the channel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Incoming call,&rdquo; the AI corrects.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;God, I know,&rdquo; Tony says, feeling judged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell her just a second.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being overridden, sir.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, now&ndash;&rdquo; Tony pulls a holographic screen out of the air.&nbsp; Security breach?&nbsp; Or just a bug in the system?<br /></p><p>What he gets is a view of Pepper&rsquo;s chin, her phone still obviously on the table in front of her as she messes with the video chat application.&nbsp; When she&rsquo;s ready, she raises the device to eye level, giving Tony a nauseating shift in perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Pep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tony catches sight of himself on camera and wipes hastily at the grease smudge on his cheek.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s wax on the tablecloth,&rdquo; Pepper says stonily.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tony shakes his head, wondering what he&rsquo;s missed.&nbsp; There has to be context, somewhere.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The candles are dripping wax on the tablecloth.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s in hot water.&nbsp; Or hot wax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you a new one.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s imported from Tibet,&rdquo; Pepper sighs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So what?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t we pay extra for global shipping?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a one-of-a-kind piece, handmade by a woman in a mountain village.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pepper&rsquo;s good like that.&nbsp; But Tony knows what she really means.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s terrible by comparison.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&nbsp; How can I make it up to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; He should get a handle on that, the begging, the desire to please, the inability to take criticism.&nbsp; But all he cares about now is making Pepper happy, lifting her spirits from the dumps he&rsquo;s thrust them into, even if it wasn&rsquo;t intentional.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; Pepper shakes her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I thought tonight would be any different.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why I thought Christmas would mean anything to you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; Tony says quickly.&nbsp; He wipes his hands on his jeans and scans the lab for something to throw on over his sweaty t-shirt.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t he have a blazer somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&nbsp; Right now.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the kitchen, hand-washing the tablecloth,&rdquo; Pepper tells him.&nbsp; Her tone is still stiff, but her lips twitch slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can make time for you.&rdquo;<br /></p>",
