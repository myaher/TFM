Glover had\nno issues with the Boltons as wardens of the North answering to the Lannisters\nof KL. But suddenly, when Dany comes to save them, Northern independence would be more important than\nan apocalyptic threat? </p><p>If they start talking bs, Jon\nshould let them make Sansa QITN, ask them to deal with the WW on their own and\npeace out with Dany, Arya, Bran and Ghost.

Shaggydog&rsquo;s were more savage.</i></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nfreedom they&rsquo;re calling for,&rdquo; declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and\nhad no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did. &ldquo;<b>They don&rsquo;t like being walled up, and who&rsquo;s\nto blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They\nwant to hunt,&rdquo; agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great\nkettle of stew. &ldquo;A wolf smells better'n any man. Like as not, they&rsquo;ve\ncaught the scent o&rsquo; prey.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Maester\nLuwin did not think so. &ldquo;Wolves often howl at the moon. <b>These are howling at the comet</b>. See how\nbright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>When\nBran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. &ldquo;Your wolves have more wit\nthan your maester,&rdquo; the wildling woman said. &ldquo;They know truths the\ngrey man has forgotten.&rdquo; The way she said it made him shiver, and <b>when he asked what the comet meant, she\nanswered, &ldquo;Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran\nasked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some\nscrolls snatched from the library fire. &ldquo;It is the sword that slays the\nseason,&rdquo; he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown\nbringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.</i></p><p><i>Though\nOld Nan did not think so, and she&rsquo;d lived longer than any of them. &ldquo;<b>Dragons</b>,&rdquo; she said, lifting her\nhead and <b>sniffing.</b> She was near\nblind and <b>could not see the comet, yet\nshe claimed she could smell it</b>. &ldquo;It be dragons, boy,&rdquo; she\ninsisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.</i></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><i>And\nstill the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in\nthe kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders\nshivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights.\nOnly Bran did not mind.</i></p><p>[\u2026]</p><p><i>It\nwas dark amongst the trees, but <b>the\ncomet lit his way, and his feet were sure</b>. He was moving on four good legs,\nstrong and swift, and he could feel the ground underfoot, the soft crackling of\nfallen leaves, thick roots and hard stones, the deep layers of humus. <b>It was a good feeling</b>.</i></p><p>Summer\u2019s howls are described as <i>long and sad, full of grief and longing</i>.\nWe see different animals (and humans) react differently to the comet: the\nhounds with fury, the horses with agitation, the Walders with fear. But the direwolves?\nWith sadness, grief and longing \u2013 it doesn\u2019t exactly point to a visceral\nanimosity towards dragons. We\u2019re told that they\u2019re restless, that they want to\nleave the castle, and Bran\u2019s wolf dream inside Summer gives us even more\nperspective, since it looks like Summer\u2019s following the comet, all the while\nbeing simply <i>content </i>at doing so. Surely,\nhe knows what he\u2019s following. If Old Nan can \u201csniff\u201d dragons, direwolves can\ntoo. </p><p><b>2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>But\nwhat about <i>that </i>time when Summer growled\nat the winged serpent atop Winterfell?</b></p><p><i>Men,\nmany men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire. No smell was more dangerous, not\neven the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin.

Shaggydog&rsquo;s were more savage.</i></p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nfreedom they&rsquo;re calling for,&rdquo; declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and\nhad no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did. &ldquo;<b>They don&rsquo;t like being walled up, and who&rsquo;s\nto blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;They\nwant to hunt,&rdquo; agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great\nkettle of stew. &ldquo;A wolf smells better'n any man. Like as not, they&rsquo;ve\ncaught the scent o&rsquo; prey.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Maester\nLuwin did not think so. &ldquo;Wolves often howl at the moon. <b>These are howling at the comet</b>. See how\nbright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>When\nBran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. &ldquo;Your wolves have more wit\nthan your maester,&rdquo; the wildling woman said. &ldquo;They know truths the\ngrey man has forgotten.&rdquo; The way she said it made him shiver, and <b>when he asked what the comet meant, she\nanswered, &ldquo;Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bran\nasked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some\nscrolls snatched from the library fire. &ldquo;It is the sword that slays the\nseason,&rdquo; he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown\nbringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right.</i></p><p><i>Though\nOld Nan did not think so, and she&rsquo;d lived longer than any of them. &ldquo;<b>Dragons</b>,&rdquo; she said, lifting her\nhead and <b>sniffing.</b> She was near\nblind and <b>could not see the comet, yet\nshe claimed she could smell it</b>. &ldquo;It be dragons, boy,&rdquo; she\ninsisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had.</i></p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p><i>And\nstill the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in\nthe kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders\nshivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights.\nOnly Bran did not mind.</i></p><p>[&hellip;]</p><p><i>It\nwas dark amongst the trees, but <b>the\ncomet lit his way, and his feet were sure</b>. He was moving on four good legs,\nstrong and swift, and he could feel the ground underfoot, the soft crackling of\nfallen leaves, thick roots and hard stones, the deep layers of humus. <b>It was a good feeling</b>.</i></p><p>Summer&rsquo;s howls are described as <i>long and sad, full of grief and longing</i>.\nWe see different animals (and humans) react differently to the comet: the\nhounds with fury, the horses with agitation, the Walders with fear. But the direwolves?\nWith sadness, grief and longing &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t exactly point to a visceral\nanimosity towards dragons. We&rsquo;re told that they&rsquo;re restless, that they want to\nleave the castle, and Bran&rsquo;s wolf dream inside Summer gives us even more\nperspective, since it looks like Summer&rsquo;s following the comet, all the while\nbeing simply <i>content </i>at doing so. Surely,\nhe knows what he&rsquo;s following. If Old Nan can &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; dragons, direwolves can\ntoo. </p><p><b>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>But\nwhat about <i>that </i>time when Summer growled\nat the winged serpent atop Winterfell?</b></p><p><i>Men,\nmany men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire. No smell was more dangerous, not\neven the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin. The\nsmoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky <b>he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared\nhis teeth,</b> but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were\neating up the stars. </i></p><p>First, we should be reminded that\nSummer and Shaggydog bare their teeth a <i>lot</i>:\ntoward each other when they fight for food, toward Jojen Reed for questioning Bran\ntoo insistently, toward little Walders for pushing Rickon in the water (even\nthough they were just playing), etc. In ACOK, we mostly see them being\naggressive when Bran and Rickon are either 1) angered, or 2) in perceived\ndanger/threatened by something/someone, so Summer&rsquo;s reaction at witnessing a &ldquo;beast&rdquo;\nburning down Bran&rsquo;s home isn&rsquo;t surprising. Of course, one could wonder why the\nwinged snake had to be put there in the first place if it meant nothing. To\nwhich I&rsquo;d argue that it <i>does </i>indeed\nmean something&hellip; else. So, we know that Bran&amp;Co were hiding in the crypts the\nnight Winterfell burned. Then, the following morning: </p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor\nHODOR!&rdquo; From above came a dull rumble.
