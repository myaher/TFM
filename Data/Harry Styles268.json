You groaned, cursing under your breath. You had a day off and you were about to rip your publicist head off for calling you before 12.</p><p>You grabbed your phone still laying down and looked at the caller-ID. \u2018Harry Styles\u2019 it said and you felt butterflies in your stomach. Your earlier frustration gone.</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019 You asked your voice still groggy from sleeping. You cleared your throat while laughing. \u2018Hello.\u2019 You said again now in your normal voice.</p><p>You heard laughing from the other end of the phone. \u2018Did I wake you?\u2019 Harry asked.</p><p>\u2018No, I am in the middle of puberty so my voice breaks sometimes.\u2019 You answered ironically. \u2018Yes, you woke me up. So, it better be good.\u2019 You said teasing.</p><p>\u2018I am really sorry for waking you but I wanted to ask if you wanted to grab some lunch together and in my defence, it is already 11.30. \u2018</p><p>\u201811.30 is way too early to wake me on my days off, remember that. But because you only know me for a day I will let it slide this one time. But don\u2019t expect me to be so friendly next time.\u2019 You said while getting out of bed. You walked to your bathroom to look at yourself in the mirror.</p><p>\u2018Should I be afraid?\u2019 He asked laughing a little bit. \u2018Very.\u2019 You said while fixing the bird nest that is your hair at the moment.</p><p>\u2018But lunch? I am up for that.\u2019 You said no longer joking around. You really wanted to go to lunch with Harry. You had such a good time last night. You really liked him.</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 Harry said. \u2018How does 12.30 sound?\u2019 He asked.</p><p>\u2018Perfect.\u2019 You said, maybe a little too enthusiastic. You slapped your hand against your forehead. Either Harry didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t want to embarrass you but he didn\u2019t comment on your answer.</p><p>\u2018Great, then I will come pick you up.\u2019 He said. You told him the address of your hotel and you both said your goodbyes.</p><p>You dropped your phone on the bed and went to take a shower. When you came back into your room, your phone was blowing up. You saw that you had multiple missed calls from your friends. You kind of started panicking. What if something bad happened to one of them?</p><p>You opened facetime and called the group chat. Their faces popped up. \u2018What happened? Is everybody okay?\u2019 You asked, worry very clear in your voice.</p><p>\u2018We are fine, but you have some explaining to do.\u2019 Charlie said. Charlie, or Charles, is an old high school friend of yours. He is now in his last year in college, studying photography in New York and he is honestly amazing.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 You asked them, very confused.</p><p>\u2018The fact that you had a date and we did not know about it.\u2019 Simone said. Simone has always lived in the house next to yours and you had been friends for forever. She studied business in Uni and now works on Wall Street.</p><p>\u2018A date?\u2019 You were looking at them like they just told you the funniest joke ever. You weren\u2019t really the big \u2018dating\u2019 type since your career demands so much of you, you don\u2019t really see the point in doing it. You did however were friends with a lot of people in the industry, men included.</p><p>\u2018Yes, your date night with none other than Harry Styles.\u2019 Lilly said in a duh-tone. Lilly, or Lillian, was a friend you met on camp when you were both 7 years old. You have stayed in touch since and always went on camp together since then. She also lives in NYC, she was born and raised in the city and takes pride in the fact.</p><p>\u2018What are you talking about I did not go on a date with Harry Styles.\u2019 You said now laughing.</p><p>\u2018There is picture prove my darling, the daily mail posted pictures of you two leaving a restaurant together.\u2019 Annie explained. Finally, there is Annie. She is your Makeup and hairstylist. Originally from Germany, but she now lives in LA. She was in Germany at the moment with her family. She has two children, a girl named Harper and a boy named Tom but we all call him Tommy.</p><p>It is amazing how these four people who have nothing in common, except for being friends with you, are so close. You couldn\u2019t be happier though. You loved them all so much.</p><p>\u2018Oh God, I went to dinner with Nick and Harry happened to be there. It was not a date.\u2019 You said, rolling your eyes. Let it be them to listen to gossip. They all love gossip a little bit too much.</p><p>\u2018But you met him, right? How was he? Did you guys talk?\u2019 Simone asked while clapping her hands.</p><p>You rolled your eyes again and they landed on the clock on your computer. 12.10 am. \u2018Shit\u2019 You said. \u2018Hey guys, I am going for lunch with Harry and he is coming to pick me up in like 20 minutes. I will call you later.\u2019 You said and when you closed the chat you could hear a lot of protest.</p><p>You texted them all you will talk later and you started getting ready for lunch. In the back of your mind you couldn\u2019t help but wonder \u2018Is this a date?\u2019</p><p>.</p><p>Harry picked you up and you both left the hotel by using the back exit. It is not that you had to hide anything, but it made you think that Harry had also seen the rumor that has been going around. And honestly you weren\u2019t really up for giving the paps more to make up rumours.</p><p>\u2018So, I was thinking we could go to this small sandwich shop. Since you haven\u2019t eaten yet today, I don\u2019t think you would be in the mood for like a full on lunch menu.\u2019 Harry said while driving out of the hotel parking lot. You couldn\u2019t help smiling at that. He is such a thoughtful person, it made you feel butterflies in your stomach.</p><p>\u2018A sandwich sounds perfect.\u2019 You said.</p><p>You had some small talk in the car. Just the usual how are you, no headache from last night, &hellip;</p><p>When you arrived at the Sandwich shop and it was honestly so cute. It looked really old from the outside but once you walked inside, it looked super cosy. You both took a seat and ordered your sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cSo, you seen the rumor yet?\u201d Harry asked cautiously. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet, but my friends called me earlier all freaking out like \u2018You went on a date with Harry Styles \u2018. \u201cYou said mimicking Charlies voice.</p><p>Harry laughed. \u201cThey are big fans by the way.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear, but what is more important to me is if you are a fan.\u201d Harry asked. He looked at you with his beautiful green eyes. They held a bit of mischief in them while he asked the question.</p><p>You really had to concentrate not to start blushing because got his accent and those beautiful green eyes would make you blush like a tomato.</p><p>\u201cOh massive, I really need to hold back now because I would jump on you right now.\u201d You said jokingly. Harry laughed at that.</p><p>At that moment, the waiter showed up and handed you your sandwiches. You thanked him.</p><p>\u201cJokes aside, I am a fan of yours. I loved your album and I even went to one of your concerts.\u201d You said, taking the first bite of your meal.</p><p>\u201cReally? Nobody ever told me you were there.\u201d Harry said, surprise in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is because I did not order VIP-tickets. When I go to concert I normally order normal seated tickets, I just love being in the crowd surrounded by other fans and just enjoy the concert. \u201cYou said.</p><p>Harry looked at you, well more like studied you and now you couldn\u2019t help the small blush on your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked him. \u201cNothing. You are just something else.\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cWell I hope that is meant in a positive way.\u201d You said. \u201cYes, certainly in a positive way.\u201d Harry said with a small smile on his face.</p><p>The rest of the lunch went by very quickly and you both decided to take a walk. You had such a good time with Harry. You both got along so well and natural. You loved that you both had the same sense of humor.</p><p>The only thing that worried you were those butterflies in your stomach who didn\u2019t want to settle. You weren\u2019t ready to fall for him; your career was demanding too much of you right now to be in a relationship.</p><p>______</p><p>T<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/ask\">hank you so much for reading, please let me know what you think!</a></p><p>_____</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177229793390/singeryn-series-banner-by-strongpowerful-alive\">MASTERLIST</a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177552708705/previous-part-next\">NEXT PART</a></p>",

I am up for that.\u2019 You said no longer joking around. You really wanted to go to lunch with Harry. You had such a good time last night. You really liked him.</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019 Harry said. \u2018How does 12.30 sound?\u2019 He asked.</p><p>\u2018Perfect.\u2019 You said, maybe a little too enthusiastic. You slapped your hand against your forehead. Either Harry didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t want to embarrass you but he didn\u2019t comment on your answer.</p><p>\u2018Great, then I will come pick you up.\u2019 He said. You told him the address of your hotel and you both said your goodbyes.</p><p>You dropped your phone on the bed and went to take a shower. When you came back into your room, your phone was blowing up. You saw that you had multiple missed calls from your friends. You kind of started panicking. What if something bad happened to one of them?</p><p>You opened facetime and called the group chat. Their faces popped up. \u2018What happened? Is everybody okay?\u2019 You asked, worry very clear in your voice.</p><p>\u2018We are fine, but you have some explaining to do.\u2019 Charlie said. Charlie, or Charles, is an old high school friend of yours. He is now in his last year in college, studying photography in New York and he is honestly amazing.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 You asked them, very confused.</p><p>\u2018The fact that you had a date and we did not know about it.\u2019 Simone said. Simone has always lived in the house next to yours and you had been friends for forever. She studied business in Uni and now works on Wall Street.</p><p>\u2018A date?\u2019 You were looking at them like they just told you the funniest joke ever. You weren\u2019t really the big \u2018dating\u2019 type since your career demands so much of you, you don\u2019t really see the point in doing it. You did however were friends with a lot of people in the industry, men included.</p><p>\u2018Yes, your date night with none other than Harry Styles.\u2019 Lilly said in a duh-tone. Lilly, or Lillian, was a friend you met on camp when you were both 7 years old. You have stayed in touch since and always went on camp together since then. She also lives in NYC, she was born and raised in the city and takes pride in the fact.</p><p>\u2018What are you talking about I did not go on a date with Harry Styles.\u2019 You said now laughing.</p><p>\u2018There is picture prove my darling, the daily mail posted pictures of you two leaving a restaurant together.\u2019 Annie explained. Finally, there is Annie. She is your Makeup and hairstylist. Originally from Germany, but she now lives in LA. She was in Germany at the moment with her family. She has two children, a girl named Harper and a boy named Tom but we all call him Tommy.</p><p>It is amazing how these four people who have nothing in common, except for being friends with you, are so close. You couldn\u2019t be happier though. You loved them all so much.</p><p>\u2018Oh God, I went to dinner with Nick and Harry happened to be there. It was not a date.\u2019 You said, rolling your eyes. Let it be them to listen to gossip. They all love gossip a little bit too much.</p><p>\u2018But you met him, right? How was he? Did you guys talk?\u2019 Simone asked while clapping her hands.</p><p>You rolled your eyes again and they landed on the clock on your computer. 12.10 am. \u2018Shit\u2019 You said. \u2018Hey guys, I am going for lunch with Harry and he is coming to pick me up in like 20 minutes. I will call you later.\u2019 You said and when you closed the chat you could hear a lot of protest.</p><p>You texted them all you will talk later and you started getting ready for lunch. In the back of your mind you couldn\u2019t help but wonder \u2018Is this a date?\u2019</p><p>.</p><p>Harry picked you up and you both left the hotel by using the back exit. It is not that you had to hide anything, but it made you think that Harry had also seen the rumor that has been going around. And honestly you weren\u2019t really up for giving the paps more to make up rumours.</p><p>\u2018So, I was thinking we could go to this small sandwich shop. Since you haven\u2019t eaten yet today, I don\u2019t think you would be in the mood for like a full on lunch menu.\u2019 Harry said while driving out of the hotel parking lot. You couldn\u2019t help smiling at that. He is such a thoughtful person, it made you feel butterflies in your stomach.</p><p>\u2018A sandwich sounds perfect.\u2019 You said.</p><p>You had some small talk in the car. Just the usual how are you, no headache from last night, \u2026</p><p>When you arrived at the Sandwich shop and it was honestly so cute. It looked really old from the outside but once you walked inside, it looked super cosy. You both took a seat and ordered your sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cSo, you seen the rumor yet?\u201d Harry asked cautiously. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet, but my friends called me earlier all freaking out like \u2018You went on a date with Harry Styles \u2018. \u201cYou said mimicking Charlies voice.</p><p>Harry laughed. \u201cThey are big fans by the way.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear, but what is more important to me is if you are a fan.\u201d Harry asked. He looked at you with his beautiful green eyes. They held a bit of mischief in them while he asked the question.</p><p>You really had to concentrate not to start blushing because got his accent and those beautiful green eyes would make you blush like a tomato.</p><p>\u201cOh massive, I really need to hold back now because I would jump on you right now.\u201d You said jokingly. Harry laughed at that.</p><p>At that moment, the waiter showed up and handed you your sandwiches. You thanked him.</p><p>\u201cJokes aside, I am a fan of yours. I loved your album and I even went to one of your concerts.\u201d You said, taking the first bite of your meal.</p><p>\u201cReally? Nobody ever told me you were there.\u201d Harry said, surprise in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is because I did not order VIP-tickets. When I go to concert I normally order normal seated tickets, I just love being in the crowd surrounded by other fans and just enjoy the concert. \u201cYou said.</p><p>Harry looked at you, well more like studied you and now you couldn\u2019t help the small blush on your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked him. \u201cNothing. You are just something else.\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cWell I hope that is meant in a positive way.\u201d You said. \u201cYes, certainly in a positive way.\u201d Harry said with a small smile on his face.</p><p>The rest of the lunch went by very quickly and you both decided to take a walk. You had such a good time with Harry. You both got along so well and natural. You loved that you both had the same sense of humor.</p><p>The only thing that worried you were those butterflies in your stomach who didn\u2019t want to settle. You weren\u2019t ready to fall for him; your career was demanding too much of you right now to be in a relationship.</p><p>______</p><p>T<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/ask\">hank you so much for reading, please let me know what you think!</a></p><p>_____</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177229793390/singeryn-series-banner-by-strongpowerful-alive\">MASTERLIST</a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177552708705/previous-part-next\">NEXT PART</a></p></p>",

Your earlier frustration gone.</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019 You asked your voice still groggy from sleeping.

So, it better be good.\u2019 You said teasing.</p><p>\u2018I am really sorry for waking you but I wanted to ask if you wanted to grab some lunch together and in my defence, it is already 11.30. \u2018</p><p>\u201811.30 is way too early to wake me on my days off, remember that.

I will call you later.&rsquo; You said and when you closed the chat you could hear a lot of protest.</p><p>You texted them all you will talk later and you started getting ready for lunch. In the back of your mind you couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder &lsquo;Is this a date?&rsquo;</p><p>.</p><p>Harry picked you up and you both left the hotel by using the back exit. It is not that you had to hide anything, but it made you think that Harry had also seen the rumor that has been going around. And honestly you weren&rsquo;t really up for giving the paps more to make up rumours.</p><p>&lsquo;So, I was thinking we could go to this small sandwich shop. Since you haven&rsquo;t eaten yet today, I don&rsquo;t think you would be in the mood for like a full on lunch menu.&rsquo; Harry said while driving out of the hotel parking lot. You couldn&rsquo;t help smiling at that. He is such a thoughtful person, it made you feel butterflies in your stomach.</p><p>&lsquo;A sandwich sounds perfect.&rsquo; You said.</p><p>You had some small talk in the car. Just the usual how are you, no headache from last night, &hellip;</p><p>When you arrived at the Sandwich shop and it was honestly so cute. It looked really old from the outside but once you walked inside, it looked super cosy. You both took a seat and ordered your sandwiches.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you seen the rumor yet?&rdquo; Harry asked cautiously. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, but my friends called me earlier all freaking out like &lsquo;You went on a date with Harry Styles &lsquo;. &ldquo;You said mimicking Charlies voice.</p><p>Harry laughed. &ldquo;They are big fans by the way.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice to hear, but what is more important to me is if you are a fan.&rdquo; Harry asked. He looked at you with his beautiful green eyes. They held a bit of mischief in them while he asked the question.</p><p>You really had to concentrate not to start blushing because got his accent and those beautiful green eyes would make you blush like a tomato.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh massive, I really need to hold back now because I would jump on you right now.&rdquo; You said jokingly. Harry laughed at that.</p><p>At that moment, the waiter showed up and handed you your sandwiches. You thanked him.</p><p>&ldquo;Jokes aside, I am a fan of yours. I loved your album and I even went to one of your concerts.&rdquo; You said, taking the first bite of your meal.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Nobody ever told me you were there.&rdquo; Harry said, surprise in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that is because I did not order VIP-tickets. When I go to concert I normally order normal seated tickets, I just love being in the crowd surrounded by other fans and just enjoy the concert. &ldquo;You said.</p><p>Harry looked at you, well more like studied you and now you couldn&rsquo;t help the small blush on your cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You asked him. &ldquo;Nothing. You are just something else.&rdquo; Harry said.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I hope that is meant in a positive way.&rdquo; You said. &ldquo;Yes, certainly in a positive way.&rdquo; Harry said with a small smile on his face.</p><p>The rest of the lunch went by very quickly and you both decided to take a walk. You had such a good time with Harry. You both got along so well and natural. You loved that you both had the same sense of humor.</p><p>The only thing that worried you were those butterflies in your stomach who didn&rsquo;t want to settle. You weren&rsquo;t ready to fall for him; your career was demanding too much of you right now to be in a relationship.</p><p>______</p><p>T<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/ask\">hank you so much for reading, please let me know what you think!</a></p><p>_____</p><p><a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177229793390/singeryn-series-banner-by-strongpowerful-alive\">MASTERLIST</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=\"https://lovelyharrystories.tumblr.com/post/177552708705/previous-part-next\">NEXT PART</a></p></p>",

When [Y/N] started to gain\na bit more consciousness, she could feel a dull sting around in eyes. The\nantics of last night\u2019s mishaps were something she was oblivious to and there wasn\u2019t\n<i>that</i> much she could remember.</p><p>As soon as her eyes are open and that\nshe\u2019s fully awake, [Y/N] looks around the space and recognises that she\nactually in her own room. Now raising more questions of how she ended up here\nin the first place. Not remembering when she came home, how she got home or who\nwith. But, she thought it were best if she didn\u2019t ponder on those topics too\nmuch.</p><p>[Y/N] carefully sits up and turns out\nthat the person sleeping beside her is actually Mark. She was thankful it was\nsomeone she actually had a chance of getting to know, <i>slightly</i>, and not\nsome stranger from tinder. Hopping right out of her bed, [Y/N] heads to the\ntowel cupboard and gathered some fresh clothes for after her shower.</p><p>The shower was defiantly refreshing, but\nit wasn\u2019t able to wipe away last night. As she stands with the water running on\nher body, all she can think about are <i>those eyes. </i>The green pair that\nstared straight into hers with no feelings, no lust or emotion. Just an empty\ndrive to plough someone in front of her. Seeing the way <i>her </i>body was\nreacting against Harry\u2019s touch made [Y/N]\u2019s blood boil.</p><p><i>Harry.</i></p><p>She hadn\u2019t spent much time thinking\nabout him after their breakup, afraid of confronting the pain and hurt that\nbreakups require you to endure.

Giving him a wave from the front of her apartment as\nhe jumps into his ride home, the car pulling away from the curb only to be\nreplaced by a blacked-out Range Rover that sped from down the street. Now the <i>only</i>\nblacked out Range Rover in this town was owned by Harry, unless there was\nsomeone else behind the wheel. So immediately when she spots the vehicle her\nhearts climbing its way up her throat. She pays close attention when the driver\u2019s\nseat door of the car opens, spotting brown curly hair with a pair of Ray Bans\non. It <i>was</i> Harry.</p><p>Before he was even halfway up the small\npavement to her door, [Y/N] slams it shut, heart racing and beating loudly. She\nthought, <i>what the actual fuck is he doing here? </i>Of course, shutting the\ndoor did <i>absolutely</i> nothing. Harry forced\nit right open and walked straight in like he was on his own property, staring\ndirectly across the way at [Y/N].</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cGet the fuck out.\u201d She demands in a low voice.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cChill out would\u2019ya? Came to drop\noff your phone.\u201d Harry\u2019s response was bitter.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow the hell did get my phone?\u201d She shoves with the question.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cDo you want it back or not?\u201d Harry presses on, holding it out to her.\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to walk up to him and snatch the device right out of his\npossession, not even saying \u2018thank you\u2019.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201c<i>Go</i>.\u201d [Y/N] points carelessly to\nthe door behind him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cWanted to ask how you are too.\u201d Harry\u2019s mood changed within a split\nsecond, going from some sort of an arrogant prick to a supposedly concerned\nperson.\u00a0</p><p>Either way, it made [Y/N] extremely\nconfused and more infuriated with him. All it did was the fuel the fire Harry\nstarted last night. Had he not incoherently asked [Y/N] to meet him upstairs,\nthis mess wouldn\u2019t have gotten any worse. [Y/N] wouldn\u2019t have a hangover and\nshe wouldn\u2019t be this repulsed by his actions. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the way it\nwas.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cI said <i>go</i> Harry, that\u2019s not\nan invitation for you to ask how I\u2019m doing.\u201d [Y/N] barges past his well-built\nbody, holding the door open for him in hopes that he\u2019d just leave and never\nreturn.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cToo bad we need to talk anyways.\u201d Harry pulls the side of the door from\nher hand and shuts it closed before walking off like he runs the place.</p><p>She follows him around as he stands on the\nopposite side of the lounge with her hands on her hips, wondering what he\u2019s\nabout to do. [Y/N] couldn\u2019t believe that his was happening. One, she wasn\u2019t\nexpecting Harry to show up let alone shove himself through her house. And two,\nthere was a part of her that still really missed Harry, so seeing him only fed\ninto that.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cWe <i>don\u2019t need to talk. </i>We\nboth made things pretty clear-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDid\nwe? I mean really, we fucked, then <i>both </i>walked\nout on each other without even saying that this was the end of us, correct?\u201d\nHarry interrupts her with the alarming truth.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpare\nme the details \u2013 tell me what you want or get out.\u201d [Y/N] demands.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJust\nwant to know your status with Mark\u201d Harry almost replies instantly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNot\nthat it\u2019s any of your fucking business but if you <i>need to know </i>then him and I are just taking things casual.\u201d [Y/N]\nwasn\u2019t very confident or assertive in what she said. She didn\u2019t know how the\nfuture was going to pan out between her and Mark, nor did she really care at\nthis point in time.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHow\ndo you know Mark anyways?\u201d [Y/N] asks him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\nknow I know a lot of people [Y/N].\u201d Harry says, in which most cases, he is\ncorrect. Harry most likely knew the tenants of the house of the party last\nnight that could\u2019ve possibly led him to be invited in the first place.</p><p>There were a few moments of silence\nbetween the pair as they stood aimlessly in her living room, wondering what the\nnext step is from there. \u201cAlright well, you gotta go Harry.\u201d [Y/N] shakes her\nhead.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m\nnot done.\u201d Harry ignores her request, standing his ground. \u201cAre you really over\nme?\u201d He asks, this time with a little hurt in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>His words felt like they hit her in the\nstomach, knocking the air right out of her lungs. [Y/N] never spent that much\ntime thinking about if she\u2019s over him. The thoughts were more so; <i>\u2018I need to hurry up and get over him.\u2019 </i>There\nwas no in between. Now that she comes to think of it, [Y/N] misses Harry, <i>deeply. </i>Watching him being touched by\nsomeone else felt like she was set on fire which was her <i>very</i> reaction when she was who Harry was about to sleep with. But\noverall, there was no way that she was over Harry. Everything that he was,\n[Y/N] loved about him down to his flaws. The best thing about him is that he\ndid the exact same for her.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAfter\njust about watching you fuck someone else <i>in\nfront of my own eyes, </i>yeah<i> </i>I\u2019d\nsay I\u2019m pretty well over you.\u201d [Y/N] replies harshly, beating around the bush\nwith her answer.</p><p>Deep down, Harry regretted that action,\na lot. He was so caught up in getting back at her \u2013 to force her to see what it\nwould be like without him and having sex with him wasn\u2019t even the biggest\nportion of that. Harry was that conniving that when he re-evaluates that\nsituation he thinks its evil. He hated himself with a passion for doing that,\nthen again, he knew what she had been up to as well. But Harry knew that, that\nwasn\u2019t an excuse to do that to her because he knew that [Y/N] <i>would never </i>do that to him. So, in some\nways, he was angry at himself and then angry at her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\nthink I don\u2019 know that you\u2019ve been fucking other guys!\u201d Harry snaps\nunexpectedly.</p><p>[Y/N] nearly jumps out of her own skin. One\nthing [Y/N] didn\u2019t miss about Harry is how angry he can get. It was very, very\nrare but when it happened, she\u2019d linger on how he lashed out. He would get\nlouder than usual and he\u2019s only ever yelled at her a few times and had been\nextremely apologetic about it, but not like this. This was somewhere out of his\nanger.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cThas\u2019 right, I know. One of your so-called friends been telling me who\nyou\u2019ve been fuckin\u2019.\u201d Harry grits.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cAt least I never fucked any of them in front of you!\u201d She has no\ntrouble in raising her voice with the same amount of volume as he did.</p><p>They both took a pause, Harry having to\nreconsider his words and actions which left him in the wrong here. All Harry\u2019s\nexcuse would\u2019ve been was the miscommunication between the two when they were\nfreshly split. Even then, it was still hard to tell what place they were in.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLook I never meant for you to\nsee\u2026<i>that</i>.\u201d Harry shakes his head with\nregret.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNah,\nyou <i>deliberately</i> meant for me to see\nthat. You looked me right in the eye Harry when it happened Harry.\u201d [Y/N] was\nat her tipping point, wanting to just bawl and cry if only he weren\u2019t in front\nof her. Harry stares at the ground, pondering over it again like it was on\nreplay.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhen\nyou wanted me to meet you upstairs, I thought we were going to work something\nout. <i>I thought </i>we could do something\nabout whatever the fuck was happening between us. I was willing to give this\nanother shot.\u201d Tears were brimming hers and Harry\u2019s eyes as [Y/N] spoke on and he\ncould just tell where this was going.</p><p>He had suspected it for a while but\nwould always ignore the fact that they should officially end it on their words.\nAside from that, Harry was beating himself up inside after [Y/N] said that she\nwas willing to talk things out with him. If he hadn\u2019t of asked his mistress to\nfollow and sleep with him upstairs in front of [Y/N], things could\u2019ve been\ndifferent at the time being.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot too late y\u2019know.\u201d Harry takes one step closer to her as she takes one step\nback. Her head is furiously shaking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo,\nI-I don\u2019t wanna\u2026\u201d [Y/N] lets out in a shaky voice, crossing her arms lowly.</p><p>He could\u2019ve sworn he heard his heart\nbreak just then, a few tears straying away down his face. Harry wipes his eyes\nwith the back of his sweaters sleeve and sniffs. <i>This was never supposed to happen, </i>he thought. They were supposed to\nbe forever in love, get married, start a family and grow old together. There\nwas absolutely nobody else in the world that he wanted to be with besides her\nand the fact that [Y/N] couldn\u2019t see that happening anymore, broke Harry\nfurther.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cPlease\nbaby, don\u2019t do this.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes shut, a couple of more tears rolling down\nhis warm skin. \u201cWe can start over n\u2019 forget this mess.\u201d He continues to plead.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s\nalready forgotten.\u201d [Y/N] chokes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBye\nHarry.\u201d </p>",

When [Y/N] started to gain\na bit more consciousness, she could feel a dull sting around in eyes. The\nantics of last night\u2019s mishaps were something she was oblivious to and there wasn\u2019t\n<i>that</i> much she could remember.</p><p>As soon as her eyes are open and that\nshe\u2019s fully awake, [Y/N] looks around the space and recognises that she\nactually in her own room.

But, she thought it were best if she didn\u2019t ponder on those topics too\nmuch.</p><p>[Y/N] carefully sits up and turns out\nthat the person sleeping beside her is actually Mark. She was thankful it was\nsomeone she actually had a chance of getting to know, <i>slightly</i>, and not\nsome stranger from tinder. Hopping right out of her bed, [Y/N] heads to the\ntowel cupboard and gathered some fresh clothes for after her shower.</p><p>The shower was defiantly refreshing, but\nit wasn\u2019t able to wipe away last night. As she stands with the water running on\nher body, all she can think about are <i>those eyes. </i>The green pair that\nstared straight into hers with no feelings, no lust or emotion. Just an empty\ndrive to plough someone in front of her. Seeing the way <i>her </i>body was\nreacting against Harry\u2019s touch made [Y/N]\u2019s blood boil.</p><p><i>Harry.</i></p><p>She hadn\u2019t spent much time thinking\nabout him after their breakup, afraid of confronting the pain and hurt that\nbreakups require you to endure. It\u2019s natural to hurt, but some people decided\nnot to feel that by choosing to do things that make them forget about it\ntemporarily. [Y/N] was guilty of that.</p><p>She shut the water off, stepping out of\nthe shower before drying herself off and putting on the comfy clothes. Looking\ninto the foggy mirror in front of her, she can see that she still has some of\nlast night\u2019s makeup on, deciding to wash it off with some cold water from the\ntap.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cOh morning.\u201d Mark chirps brightly as she walks out from her bathroom.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cMorning.\u201d She replies in a less upbeat tone of voice than Mark.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou feeling alright?\u201d He asks her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be honest; not amazing.

She\nthought, <i>what the actual fuck is he doing here? </i>Of course, shutting the\ndoor did <i>absolutely</i> nothing. Harry forced\nit right open and walked straight in like he was on his own property, staring\ndirectly across the way at [Y/N].</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cGet the fuck out.\u201d She demands in a low voice.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cChill out would\u2019ya? Came to drop\noff your phone.\u201d Harry\u2019s response was bitter.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow the hell did get my phone?\u201d She shoves with the question.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cDo you want it back or not?\u201d Harry presses on, holding it out to her.\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to walk up to him and snatch the device right out of his\npossession, not even saying \u2018thank you\u2019.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201c<i>Go</i>.\u201d [Y/N] points carelessly to\nthe door behind him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cWanted to ask how you are too.\u201d Harry\u2019s mood changed within a split\nsecond, going from some sort of an arrogant prick to a supposedly concerned\nperson.\u00a0</p><p>Either way, it made [Y/N] extremely\nconfused and more infuriated with him. All it did was the fuel the fire Harry\nstarted last night. Had he not incoherently asked [Y/N] to meet him upstairs,\nthis mess wouldn\u2019t have gotten any worse. [Y/N] wouldn\u2019t have a hangover and\nshe wouldn\u2019t be this repulsed by his actions. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the way it\nwas.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cI said <i>go</i> Harry, that\u2019s not\nan invitation for you to ask how I\u2019m doing.\u201d [Y/N] barges past his well-built\nbody, holding the door open for him in hopes that he\u2019d just leave and never\nreturn.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cToo bad we need to talk anyways.\u201d Harry pulls the side of the door from\nher hand and shuts it closed before walking off like he runs the place.</p><p>She follows him around as he stands on the\nopposite side of the lounge with her hands on her hips, wondering what he\u2019s\nabout to do. [Y/N] couldn\u2019t believe that his was happening. One, she wasn\u2019t\nexpecting Harry to show up let alone shove himself through her house. And two,\nthere was a part of her that still really missed Harry, so seeing him only fed\ninto that.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cWe <i>don\u2019t need to talk. </i>We\nboth made things pretty clear-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDid\nwe? I mean really, we fucked, then <i>both </i>walked\nout on each other without even saying that this was the end of us, correct?\u201d\nHarry interrupts her with the alarming truth.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSpare\nme the details \u2013 tell me what you want or get out.\u201d [Y/N] demands.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJust\nwant to know your status with Mark\u201d Harry almost replies instantly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNot\nthat it\u2019s any of your fucking business but if you <i>need to know </i>then him and I are just taking things casual.\u201d [Y/N]\nwasn\u2019t very confident or assertive in what she said. She didn\u2019t know how the\nfuture was going to pan out between her and Mark, nor did she really care at\nthis point in time.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHow\ndo you know Mark anyways?\u201d [Y/N] asks him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\nknow I know a lot of people [Y/N].\u201d Harry says, in which most cases, he is\ncorrect. Harry most likely knew the tenants of the house of the party last\nnight that could\u2019ve possibly led him to be invited in the first place.</p><p>There were a few moments of silence\nbetween the pair as they stood aimlessly in her living room, wondering what the\nnext step is from there. \u201cAlright well, you gotta go Harry.\u201d [Y/N] shakes her\nhead.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m\nnot done.\u201d Harry ignores her request, standing his ground. \u201cAre you really over\nme?\u201d He asks, this time with a little hurt in his voice.\u00a0</p><p>His words felt like they hit her in the\nstomach, knocking the air right out of her lungs. [Y/N] never spent that much\ntime thinking about if she\u2019s over him. The thoughts were more so; <i>\u2018I need to hurry up and get over him.\u2019 </i>There\nwas no in between. Now that she comes to think of it, [Y/N] misses Harry, <i>deeply. </i>Watching him being touched by\nsomeone else felt like she was set on fire which was her <i>very</i> reaction when she was who Harry was about to sleep with. But\noverall, there was no way that she was over Harry. Everything that he was,\n[Y/N] loved about him down to his flaws. The best thing about him is that he\ndid the exact same for her.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAfter\njust about watching you fuck someone else <i>in\nfront of my own eyes, </i>yeah<i> </i>I\u2019d\nsay I\u2019m pretty well over you.\u201d [Y/N] replies harshly, beating around the bush\nwith her answer.</p><p>Deep down, Harry regretted that action,\na lot. He was so caught up in getting back at her \u2013 to force her to see what it\nwould be like without him and having sex with him wasn\u2019t even the biggest\nportion of that. Harry was that conniving that when he re-evaluates that\nsituation he thinks its evil. He hated himself with a passion for doing that,\nthen again, he knew what she had been up to as well. But Harry knew that, that\nwasn\u2019t an excuse to do that to her because he knew that [Y/N] <i>would never </i>do that to him. So, in some\nways, he was angry at himself and then angry at her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\nthink I don\u2019 know that you\u2019ve been fucking other guys!\u201d Harry snaps\nunexpectedly.</p><p>[Y/N] nearly jumps out of her own skin. One\nthing [Y/N] didn\u2019t miss about Harry is how angry he can get. It was very, very\nrare but when it happened, she\u2019d linger on how he lashed out. He would get\nlouder than usual and he\u2019s only ever yelled at her a few times and had been\nextremely apologetic about it, but not like this. This was somewhere out of his\nanger.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cThas\u2019 right, I know. One of your so-called friends been telling me who\nyou\u2019ve been fuckin\u2019.\u201d Harry grits.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cAt least I never fucked any of them in front of you!\u201d She has no\ntrouble in raising her voice with the same amount of volume as he did.</p><p>They both took a pause, Harry having to\nreconsider his words and actions which left him in the wrong here. All Harry\u2019s\nexcuse would\u2019ve been was the miscommunication between the two when they were\nfreshly split. Even then, it was still hard to tell what place they were in.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLook I never meant for you to\nsee\u2026<i>that</i>.\u201d Harry shakes his head with\nregret.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNah,\nyou <i>deliberately</i> meant for me to see\nthat. You looked me right in the eye Harry when it happened Harry.\u201d [Y/N] was\nat her tipping point, wanting to just bawl and cry if only he weren\u2019t in front\nof her. Harry stares at the ground, pondering over it again like it was on\nreplay.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhen\nyou wanted me to meet you upstairs, I thought we were going to work something\nout. <i>I thought </i>we could do something\nabout whatever the fuck was happening between us. I was willing to give this\nanother shot.\u201d Tears were brimming hers and Harry\u2019s eyes as [Y/N] spoke on and he\ncould just tell where this was going.</p><p>He had suspected it for a while but\nwould always ignore the fact that they should officially end it on their words.\nAside from that, Harry was beating himself up inside after [Y/N] said that she\nwas willing to talk things out with him. If he hadn\u2019t of asked his mistress to\nfollow and sleep with him upstairs in front of [Y/N], things could\u2019ve been\ndifferent at the time being.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot too late y\u2019know.\u201d Harry takes one step closer to her as she takes one step\nback. Her head is furiously shaking.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo,\nI-I don\u2019t wanna\u2026\u201d [Y/N] lets out in a shaky voice, crossing her arms lowly.</p><p>He could\u2019ve sworn he heard his heart\nbreak just then, a few tears straying away down his face. Harry wipes his eyes\nwith the back of his sweaters sleeve and sniffs. <i>This was never supposed to happen, </i>he thought. They were supposed to\nbe forever in love, get married, start a family and grow old together. There\nwas absolutely nobody else in the world that he wanted to be with besides her\nand the fact that [Y/N] couldn\u2019t see that happening anymore, broke Harry\nfurther.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cPlease\nbaby, don\u2019t do this.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes shut, a couple of more tears rolling down\nhis warm skin. \u201cWe can start over n\u2019 forget this mess.\u201d He continues to plead.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s\nalready forgotten.\u201d [Y/N] chokes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBye\nHarry.\u201d </p></p>",

When [Y/N] started to gain\na bit more consciousness, she could feel a dull sting around in eyes. The\nantics of last night\u2019s mishaps were something she was oblivious to and there wasn\u2019t\n<i>that</i> much she could remember.</p><p>As soon as her eyes are open and that\nshe\u2019s fully awake, [Y/N] looks around the space and recognises that she\nactually in her own room. Now raising more questions of how she ended up here\nin the first place. Not remembering when she came home, how she got home or who\nwith. But, she thought it were best if she didn\u2019t ponder on those topics too\nmuch.</p><p>[Y/N] carefully sits up and turns out\nthat the person sleeping beside her is actually Mark. She was thankful it was\nsomeone she actually had a chance of getting to know, <i>slightly</i>, and not\nsome stranger from tinder. Hopping right out of her bed, [Y/N] heads to the\ntowel cupboard and gathered some fresh clothes for after her shower.</p><p>The shower was defiantly refreshing, but\nit wasn\u2019t able to wipe away last night. As she stands with the water running on\nher body, all she can think about are <i>those eyes. </i>The green pair that\nstared straight into hers with no feelings, no lust or emotion. Just an empty\ndrive to plough someone in front of her. Seeing the way <i>her </i>body was\nreacting against Harry\u2019s touch made [Y/N]\u2019s blood boil.</p><p><i>Harry.</i></p><p>She hadn\u2019t spent much time thinking\nabout him after their breakup, afraid of confronting the pain and hurt that\nbreakups require you to endure. It\u2019s natural to hurt, but some people decided\nnot to feel that by choosing to do things that make them forget about it\ntemporarily. [Y/N] was guilty of that.</p><p>She shut the water off, stepping out of\nthe shower before drying herself off and putting on the comfy clothes. Looking\ninto the foggy mirror in front of her, she can see that she still has some of\nlast night\u2019s makeup on, deciding to wash it off with some cold water from the\ntap.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cOh morning.\u201d Mark chirps brightly as she walks out from her bathroom.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cMorning.\u201d She replies in a less upbeat tone of voice than Mark.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou feeling alright?\u201d He asks her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be honest; not amazing. But\nthat\u2019s what I get for drinking too much.\u201d [Y/N] answers.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cToo much? Pretty sure you had the <i>entire</i> bar.\u201d Mark laughed with an sheepish\ngrin on his face. It made her want to bury herself into the cover in\nembarrassment\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGuess I did some pretty stupid shit\nthen.\u201d [Y/N] lets out a sigh. Mark looked to the side for a moment, flattening\nhis lips.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cStupid might be a <i>little</i> bit of an understatement.\u201d He\nsaid with as much honesty as he could.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cFor fuck sakes.\u201d [Y/N] groans. She knew very well that she didn\u2019t like\ngetting drunk, <i>at least not that drunk anyways. </i>Then the hangover is something\nelse she hated.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again.\u201d She addresses firmly, pressing a hand to her\nhead.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cYou sure? Seemed like you had a pretty good reason to last night.\u201d Mark\nsecond guesses her statement, and she did have a pretty good reason. But [Y/N]\ndidn\u2019t answer, not wanting to dig herself further into the hole she was already\nin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cWhen\u2019s there never a good reason to drink?\u201d [Y/N] replies, beating\naround the bushes with her answer.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong you know. I was gonna ask you if you wanted to go out\nfor dinner and a drink but, dinner might just be best for you.\u201d Mark joked,\nmaking her laugh a bit.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cYeah, that\u2019d be nice.\u201d [Y/N] nodded.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cGood, I have your number anyways, but I need to go home and feed my\ndogs before they find a way to get into my fridge.\u201d Says Mark which makes [Y/N]\nthink about where her phone is actually located.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cAw, what sort of dogs do you have?\u201d She asks out of curiosity.</p><p>Mark pulls his phone out from his back\npocket, pressing the lock button to illuminate the screen, revealing a photo of\ntwo beautiful long-haired German shepherds.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cGod they\u2019re gorgeous!\u201d [Y/N] exclaimed.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, love\u2019em to bits, maybe after\ndinner if you want, we can swing past mine and you can meet them.\u201d He suggests.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cDon\u2019t even need to ask me twice.\u201d She says.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cAlright then, it\u2019s a date.\u201d Mark winks across at her, butterflies\nerupting in her stomach.</p><p>[Y/N] sees Marks to the door after he\ngets his stuff together. Giving him a wave from the front of her apartment as\nhe jumps into his ride home, the car pulling away from the curb only to be\nreplaced by a blacked-out Range Rover that sped from down the street. Now the <i>only</i>\nblacked out Range Rover in this town was owned by Harry, unless there was\nsomeone else behind the wheel. So immediately when she spots the vehicle her\nhearts climbing its way up her throat. She pays close attention when the driver\u2019s\nseat door of the car opens, spotting brown curly hair with a pair of Ray Bans\non. It <i>was</i> Harry.</p><p>Before he was even halfway up the small\npavement to her door, [Y/N] slams it shut, heart racing and beating loudly.

[Y/N] never spent that much\ntime thinking about if she\u2019s over him. The thoughts were more so; <i>\u2018I need to hurry up and get over him.\u2019 </i>There\nwas no in between. Now that she comes to think of it, [Y/N] misses Harry, <i>deeply. </i>Watching him being touched by\nsomeone else felt like she was set on fire which was her <i>very</i> reaction when she was who Harry was about to sleep with. But\noverall, there was no way that she was over Harry. Everything that he was,\n[Y/N] loved about him down to his flaws.

He was so caught up in getting back at her \u2013 to force her to see what it\nwould be like without him and having sex with him wasn\u2019t even the biggest\nportion of that. Harry was that conniving that when he re-evaluates that\nsituation he thinks its evil. He hated himself with a passion for doing that,\nthen again, he knew what she had been up to as well. But Harry knew that, that\nwasn\u2019t an excuse to do that to her because he knew that [Y/N] <i>would never </i>do that to him. So, in some\nways, he was angry at himself and then angry at her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\nthink I don\u2019 know that you\u2019ve been fucking other guys!\u201d Harry snaps\nunexpectedly.</p><p>[Y/N] nearly jumps out of her own skin. One\nthing [Y/N] didn\u2019t miss about Harry is how angry he can get. It was very, very\nrare but when it happened, she\u2019d linger on how he lashed out. He would get\nlouder than usual and he\u2019s only ever yelled at her a few times and had been\nextremely apologetic about it, but not like this. This was somewhere out of his\nanger.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u201cThas\u2019 right, I know.

All Harry\u2019s\nexcuse would\u2019ve been was the miscommunication between the two when they were\nfreshly split. Even then, it was still hard to tell what place they were in.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLook I never meant for you to\nsee\u2026<i>that</i>.\u201d Harry shakes his head with\nregret.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNah,\nyou <i>deliberately</i> meant for me to see\nthat. You looked me right in the eye Harry when it happened Harry.\u201d [Y/N] was\nat her tipping point, wanting to just bawl and cry if only he weren\u2019t in front\nof her. Harry stares at the ground, pondering over it again like it was on\nreplay.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhen\nyou wanted me to meet you upstairs, I thought we were going to work something\nout. <i>I thought </i>we could do something\nabout whatever the fuck was happening between us.

If he hadn\u2019t of asked his mistress to\nfollow and sleep with him upstairs in front of [Y/N], things could\u2019ve been\ndifferent at the time being.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot too late y\u2019know.\u201d Harry takes one step closer to her as she takes one step\nback.

Harry wipes his eyes\nwith the back of his sweaters sleeve and sniffs. <i>This was never supposed to happen, </i>he thought. They were supposed to\nbe forever in love, get married, start a family and grow old together. There\nwas absolutely nobody else in the world that he wanted to be with besides her\nand the fact that [Y/N] couldn\u2019t see that happening anymore, broke Harry\nfurther.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cPlease\nbaby, don\u2019t do this.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes shut, a couple of more tears rolling down\nhis warm skin. \u201cWe can start over n\u2019 forget this mess.\u201d He continues to plead.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s\nalready forgotten.\u201d [Y/N] chokes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBye\nHarry.\u201d </p></p>",

When [Y/N] started to gain\na bit more consciousness, she could feel a dull sting around in eyes. The\nantics of last night&rsquo;s mishaps were something she was oblivious to and there wasn&rsquo;t\n<i>that</i> much she could remember.</p><p>As soon as her eyes are open and that\nshe&rsquo;s fully awake, [Y/N] looks around the space and recognises that she\nactually in her own room. Now raising more questions of how she ended up here\nin the first place. Not remembering when she came home, how she got home or who\nwith. But, she thought it were best if she didn&rsquo;t ponder on those topics too\nmuch.</p><p>[Y/N] carefully sits up and turns out\nthat the person sleeping beside her is actually Mark. She was thankful it was\nsomeone she actually had a chance of getting to know, <i>slightly</i>, and not\nsome stranger from tinder. Hopping right out of her bed, [Y/N] heads to the\ntowel cupboard and gathered some fresh clothes for after her shower.</p><p>The shower was defiantly refreshing, but\nit wasn&rsquo;t able to wipe away last night. As she stands with the water running on\nher body, all she can think about are <i>those eyes. </i>The green pair that\nstared straight into hers with no feelings, no lust or emotion. Just an empty\ndrive to plough someone in front of her. Seeing the way <i>her </i>body was\nreacting against Harry&rsquo;s touch made [Y/N]&rsquo;s blood boil.</p><p><i>Harry.</i></p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t spent much time thinking\nabout him after their breakup, afraid of confronting the pain and hurt that\nbreakups require you to endure. It&rsquo;s natural to hurt, but some people decided\nnot to feel that by choosing to do things that make them forget about it\ntemporarily. [Y/N] was guilty of that.</p><p>She shut the water off, stepping out of\nthe shower before drying herself off and putting on the comfy clothes. Looking\ninto the foggy mirror in front of her, she can see that she still has some of\nlast night&rsquo;s makeup on, deciding to wash it off with some cold water from the\ntap.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Oh morning.&rdquo; Mark chirps brightly as she walks out from her bathroom.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo; She replies in a less upbeat tone of voice than Mark.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;You feeling alright?&rdquo; He asks her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be honest; not amazing. But\nthat&rsquo;s what I get for drinking too much.&rdquo; [Y/N] answers.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Too much? Pretty sure you had the <i>entire</i> bar.&rdquo; Mark laughed with an sheepish\ngrin on his face. It made her want to bury herself into the cover in\nembarrassment&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Guess I did some pretty stupid shit\nthen.&rdquo; [Y/N] lets out a sigh. Mark looked to the side for a moment, flattening\nhis lips.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Stupid might be a <i>little</i> bit of an understatement.&rdquo; He\nsaid with as much honesty as he could.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;For fuck sakes.&rdquo; [Y/N] groans. She knew very well that she didn&rsquo;t like\ngetting drunk, <i>at least not that drunk anyways. </i>Then the hangover is something\nelse she hated.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never drinking again.&rdquo; She addresses firmly, pressing a hand to her\nhead.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;You sure? Seemed like you had a pretty good reason to last night.&rdquo; Mark\nsecond guesses her statement, and she did have a pretty good reason. But [Y/N]\ndidn&rsquo;t answer, not wanting to dig herself further into the hole she was already\nin.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;When&rsquo;s there never a good reason to drink?&rdquo; [Y/N] replies, beating\naround the bushes with her answer.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wrong you know. I was gonna ask you if you wanted to go out\nfor dinner and a drink but, dinner might just be best for you.&rdquo; Mark joked,\nmaking her laugh a bit.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;d be nice.&rdquo; [Y/N] nodded.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Good, I have your number anyways, but I need to go home and feed my\ndogs before they find a way to get into my fridge.&rdquo; Says Mark which makes [Y/N]\nthink about where her phone is actually located.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Aw, what sort of dogs do you have?&rdquo; She asks out of curiosity.</p><p>Mark pulls his phone out from his back\npocket, pressing the lock button to illuminate the screen, revealing a photo of\ntwo beautiful long-haired German shepherds.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;God they&rsquo;re gorgeous!&rdquo; [Y/N] exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, love&rsquo;em to bits, maybe after\ndinner if you want, we can swing past mine and you can meet them.&rdquo; He suggests.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even need to ask me twice.&rdquo; She says.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Alright then, it&rsquo;s a date.&rdquo; Mark winks across at her, butterflies\nerupting in her stomach.</p><p>[Y/N] sees Marks to the door after he\ngets his stuff together. Giving him a wave from the front of her apartment as\nhe jumps into his ride home, the car pulling away from the curb only to be\nreplaced by a blacked-out Range Rover that sped from down the street. Now the <i>only</i>\nblacked out Range Rover in this town was owned by Harry, unless there was\nsomeone else behind the wheel. So immediately when she spots the vehicle her\nhearts climbing its way up her throat. She pays close attention when the driver&rsquo;s\nseat door of the car opens, spotting brown curly hair with a pair of Ray Bans\non. It <i>was</i> Harry.</p><p>Before he was even halfway up the small\npavement to her door, [Y/N] slams it shut, heart racing and beating loudly. She\nthought, <i>what the actual fuck is he doing here? </i>Of course, shutting the\ndoor did <i>absolutely</i> nothing. Harry forced\nit right open and walked straight in like he was on his own property, staring\ndirectly across the way at [Y/N].</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Get the fuck out.&rdquo; She demands in a low voice.&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Chill out would&rsquo;ya? Came to drop\noff your phone.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s response was bitter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;How the hell did get my phone?&rdquo; She shoves with the question.&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Do you want it back or not?&rdquo; Harry presses on, holding it out to her.\nIt didn&rsquo;t take her long to walk up to him and snatch the device right out of his\npossession, not even saying &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;<i>Go</i>.&rdquo; [Y/N] points carelessly to\nthe door behind him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n&ldquo;Wanted to ask how you are too.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s mood changed within a split\nsecond, going from some sort of an arrogant prick to a supposedly concerned\nperson.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, it made [Y/N] extremely\nconfused and more infuriated with him.

Harry stares at the ground, pondering over it again like it was on\nreplay.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;When\nyou wanted me to meet you upstairs, I thought we were going to work something\nout. <i>I thought </i>we could do something\nabout whatever the fuck was happening between us. I was willing to give this\nanother shot.&rdquo; Tears were brimming hers and Harry&rsquo;s eyes as [Y/N] spoke on and he\ncould just tell where this was going.</p><p>He had suspected it for a while but\nwould always ignore the fact that they should officially end it on their words.\nAside from that, Harry was beating himself up inside after [Y/N] said that she\nwas willing to talk things out with him. If he hadn&rsquo;t of asked his mistress to\nfollow and sleep with him upstairs in front of [Y/N], things could&rsquo;ve been\ndifferent at the time being.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nnot too late y&rsquo;know.&rdquo; Harry takes one step closer to her as she takes one step\nback. Her head is furiously shaking.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;No,\nI-I don&rsquo;t wanna&hellip;&rdquo; [Y/N] lets out in a shaky voice, crossing her arms lowly.</p><p>He could&rsquo;ve sworn he heard his heart\nbreak just then, a few tears straying away down his face. Harry wipes his eyes\nwith the back of his sweaters sleeve and sniffs. <i>This was never supposed to happen, </i>he thought. They were supposed to\nbe forever in love, get married, start a family and grow old together. There\nwas absolutely nobody else in the world that he wanted to be with besides her\nand the fact that [Y/N] couldn&rsquo;t see that happening anymore, broke Harry\nfurther.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Please\nbaby, don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes shut, a couple of more tears rolling down\nhis warm skin. &ldquo;We can start over n&rsquo; forget this mess.&rdquo; He continues to plead.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nalready forgotten.&rdquo; [Y/N] chokes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Bye\nHarry.&rdquo; </p></p>",
