I apologize!</b></p><hr><p>You grew up in what most people would call a normal family. After all, you had two parents who loved you. But loving and liking or two very different things. Your mother, ever the caring woman she was, both loved and liked you. She took an interest in the things you liked simply because you liked them. And if it turned out that she wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it, she would still listen and talk to you about whatever it was. She died a couple of years ago and you were left to the custody of your dad.</p><p>Your dad&hellip; he loved you, truly, he did, he just didn\u2019t seem to like you all that much. He always seemed to get annoyed with you when you asked him questions or requested that he drive you places. You tried your\u00a0best to be in his good graces; to do what he asked and to be someone he could be proud of. You even worked your butt off, spent countless hours losing sleep so that you could land the Stark internship alongside your dear friend Peter. But it still didn\u2019t seem like enough. So now you use the internship as an opportunity to be away from home.</p><p>The people in the tower were nice enough. They would greet you in the mornings and bid you goodbye when they left. They would check in on you everytime they needed to drop by to speak with Tony and make polite conversation with you. Overall, it was much more pleasant than staying at home with your dad. You didn\u2019t really think anyone would notice that you had been avoiding spending time at home. You were hoping people would just assume you were a hard worker. And some people did believe that, but Tony had watched over you since you had come to work with him. He found various pieces of machinery fixed or finished without any knowledge\u00a0of doing it himself and after he had watched you a little more closely, he had found that you were the one helping him with the seemingly uncrackable problems he had run into.</p><p>You had come to see Tony as somewhat of a father figure. He was always the one who made sure you didn\u2019t forget to eat, was always willing to come to important events you had, ones your parents weren\u2019t always able to go to. He asked you about your school and your grades and all around just wanted to make sure you were happy. You really did appreciate Tony being there for and making you feel loved and wanted, but you felt it was a little silly to look at him as a father because it never felt like he saw you as a daughter. So you never told him. You just assumed he was probably being so kind because you were still a kid.</p><p>Tony was working on another prototype for his suit when he finally glanced at the clock and saw it was 11:34pm. He thought it odd that you hadn\u2019t come to say goodbye yet, as you usually let him know when you were leaving so he wouldn\u2019t freak out about where you were. Deciding to check, he put down his tools and walked to the lab he had set you up in. When he came in, he saw you slowly nod off. He was about to wake you up when you straightened out and appeared to be trying to <i>not</i>\u00a0fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you still doing here kiddo?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cOh hey, Mr. Stark. I was just finishing up the project you gave me.\u201d Tony knew that was a lie. He saw the finished product earlier in the afternoon.<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N, is there a reason you don\u2019t want to go home?\u201d The question startled you. You knew the answer. Of course you did. When being at home made you feel so lonely that you had no choice <i>but</i>\u00a0to feel it, there wasn\u2019t much room for confusion.<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, what do you mean? I mean, why do you ask?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what I mean and I\u2019m asking because you\u2019ve been staying here really late recently. I know well enough that it isn\u2019t because you want to get your projects. I see you finish them way before your day is even done. At first, I thought maybe you thought the work was boring but if the things I give you really are that boring then you would take off right when you\u2019re off the clock. But you\u2019re here hours after you\u2019re supposed to go home. Why don\u2019t you want to go home?\u201d<br/></p><p>You didn\u2019t know what to say. What were you even supposed to say? You could tell him why you didn\u2019t want to go home but to tell him that the reason you stayed was that you didn\u2019t get enough fatherly affection at home and that you desperately wanted that kind of parental affection from him was, frankly, unprofessional.</p><p>\u201cI just like being here. Is that bad?\u201d You defended.<br/></p><p>\u201cKid. I\u2019m not accusing you of anything. I just want to make sure you\u2019re alright. This lab is completely bare and freezing. Why is it you like staying here so much?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I mean you.\u201d You said it as quietly as you could but by the way his eyes widened a fraction you could tell he heard. You could have easily said you liked the atmosphere and maybe it was because of your sleepy brain that you didn\u2019t, and right now you were yelling at yourself in your head for not lying. The next best thing, you figured, was to explain yourself before he got the wrong idea.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just&hellip; Mr. Stark my dad and I&hellip; we don\u2019t really get along. He loves me and all that but he just&hellip; would rather I not be around him so often. I stay away because of that and honestly I stay away because when he looks at me he doesn\u2019t look like he loves me. He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s proud. He just looks like I\u2019m another object that clutters up the living room.\u201d Something wet was dropping on your had. Tear, you realized. You were crying.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t ask for any of this. I\u2019ll go home now. See you tomorrow.\u201d You got up and, with your head hung low, you tried to pass Tony as quickly as possible. Before you could make it any farther than where you stood, Tony pulled you into a hug. He held you so tight it felt like he was squeezing all of the tears from your eyes and onto his shirt. You felt bad for ruining what was probably a really expensive shirt but getting a hug from someone you saw as a father figure felt so right that you couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Y/N. You don\u2019t deserve that,\u201d Tony said once you had calmed down. He pulled away so that he could look at you.\u00a0\u201cHow about instead of staying in the lab when your day is done you come to my house. Pepper loves you and keeps bugging me about having you over for dinner anyway. You can get a break from your dad without having to stay in this desolate lab.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cReally? Are you sure that\u2019s okay?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than okay Y/N. I mean you\u2019re practically family to Pepper and me so we might as well treat you like it too.\u201d You launched yourself into his arms again for another hug. You were ecstatic that Tony saw you as a daughter just as you had seen him as a father. That night you went to Tony\u2019s house and had, granted a very late, dinner with him and Pepper. Pepper had offered to set you up in their guest bedroom for the night and said that you could just borrow some clothes. You quickly shot your dad a text letting him know you weren\u2019t coming home before turning in for the night.</p><p>From that day forward you would spend almost every day at the Stark household before going home. Tony and Pepper treated you like a daughter and often invited you to their holiday gathering, showing you off to their guests. Things with your father still hadn\u2019t changed but now you had a second family you could turn to when you needed.</p>",

The next best thing, you figured, was to explain yourself before he got the wrong idea.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Mr. Stark my dad and I\u2026 we don\u2019t really get along. He loves me and all that but he just\u2026 would rather I not be around him so often. I stay away because of that and honestly I stay away because when he looks at me he doesn\u2019t look like he loves me. He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s proud. He just looks like I\u2019m another object that clutters up the living room.\u201d Something wet was dropping on your had. Tear, you realized. You were crying.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t ask for any of this. I\u2019ll go home now. See you tomorrow.\u201d You got up and, with your head hung low, you tried to pass Tony as quickly as possible. Before you could make it any farther than where you stood, Tony pulled you into a hug. He held you so tight it felt like he was squeezing all of the tears from your eyes and onto his shirt. You felt bad for ruining what was probably a really expensive shirt but getting a hug from someone you saw as a father figure felt so right that you couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Y/N. You don\u2019t deserve that,\u201d Tony said once you had calmed down. He pulled away so that he could look at you.\u00a0\u201cHow about instead of staying in the lab when your day is done you come to my house. Pepper loves you and keeps bugging me about having you over for dinner anyway. You can get a break from your dad without having to stay in this desolate lab.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cReally? Are you sure that\u2019s okay?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than okay Y/N. I mean you\u2019re practically family to Pepper and me so we might as well treat you like it too.\u201d You launched yourself into his arms again for another hug. You were ecstatic that Tony saw you as a daughter just as you had seen him as a father. That night you went to Tony\u2019s house and had, granted a very late, dinner with him and Pepper. Pepper had offered to set you up in their guest bedroom for the night and said that you could just borrow some clothes. You quickly shot your dad a text letting him know you weren\u2019t coming home before turning in for the night.</p><p>From that day forward you would spend almost every day at the Stark household before going home. Tony and Pepper treated you like a daughter and often invited you to their holiday gathering, showing you off to their guests. Things with your father still hadn\u2019t changed but now you had a second family you could turn to when you needed.</p>",

I apologize!</b></p><hr><p>You grew up in what most people would call a normal family. After all, you had two parents who loved you. But loving and liking or two very different things. Your mother, ever the caring woman she was, both loved and liked you. She took an interest in the things you liked simply because you liked them. And if it turned out that she wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it, she would still listen and talk to you about whatever it was. She died a couple of years ago and you were left to the custody of your dad.</p><p>Your dad\u2026 he loved you, truly, he did, he just didn\u2019t seem to like you all that much. He always seemed to get annoyed with you when you asked him questions or requested that he drive you places. You tried your\u00a0best to be in his good graces; to do what he asked and to be someone he could be proud of. You even worked your butt off, spent countless hours losing sleep so that you could land the Stark internship alongside your dear friend Peter. But it still didn\u2019t seem like enough. So now you use the internship as an opportunity to be away from home.</p><p>The people in the tower were nice enough. They would greet you in the mornings and bid you goodbye when they left. They would check in on you everytime they needed to drop by to speak with Tony and make polite conversation with you. Overall, it was much more pleasant than staying at home with your dad. You didn\u2019t really think anyone would notice that you had been avoiding spending time at home. You were hoping people would just assume you were a hard worker. And some people did believe that, but Tony had watched over you since you had come to work with him. He found various pieces of machinery fixed or finished without any knowledge\u00a0of doing it himself and after he had watched you a little more closely, he had found that you were the one helping him with the seemingly uncrackable problems he had run into.</p><p>You had come to see Tony as somewhat of a father figure. He was always the one who made sure you didn\u2019t forget to eat, was always willing to come to important events you had, ones your parents weren\u2019t always able to go to. He asked you about your school and your grades and all around just wanted to make sure you were happy. You really did appreciate Tony being there for and making you feel loved and wanted, but you felt it was a little silly to look at him as a father because it never felt like he saw you as a daughter. So you never told him. You just assumed he was probably being so kind because you were still a kid.</p><p>Tony was working on another prototype for his suit when he finally glanced at the clock and saw it was 11:34pm. He thought it odd that you hadn\u2019t come to say goodbye yet, as you usually let him know when you were leaving so he wouldn\u2019t freak out about where you were. Deciding to check, he put down his tools and walked to the lab he had set you up in. When he came in, he saw you slowly nod off. He was about to wake you up when you straightened out and appeared to be trying to <i>not</i>\u00a0fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you still doing here kiddo?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cOh hey, Mr. Stark. I was just finishing up the project you gave me.\u201d Tony knew that was a lie. He saw the finished product earlier in the afternoon.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N, is there a reason you don\u2019t want to go home?\u201d The question startled you. You knew the answer. Of course you did. When being at home made you feel so lonely that you had no choice <i>but</i>\u00a0to feel it, there wasn\u2019t much room for confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cUh, what do you mean? I mean, why do you ask?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what I mean and I\u2019m asking because you\u2019ve been staying here really late recently. I know well enough that it isn\u2019t because you want to get your projects. I see you finish them way before your day is even done. At first, I thought maybe you thought the work was boring but if the things I give you really are that boring then you would take off right when you\u2019re off the clock. But you\u2019re here hours after you\u2019re supposed to go home. Why don\u2019t you want to go home?\u201d<br></p><p>You didn\u2019t know what to say. What were you even supposed to say? You could tell him why you didn\u2019t want to go home but to tell him that the reason you stayed was that you didn\u2019t get enough fatherly affection at home and that you desperately wanted that kind of parental affection from him was, frankly, unprofessional.</p><p>\u201cI just like being here. Is that bad?\u201d You defended.<br></p><p>\u201cKid. I\u2019m not accusing you of anything. I just want to make sure you\u2019re alright. This lab is completely bare and freezing.
