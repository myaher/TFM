        "answer": "<p>Thank you, love! I hope you enjoy this one i wrote for you. Xx</p><p>\u2014\u00a0</p><p>That night Harry was so mad because of her, flirting with the waiter, he could hardly contain himself. He, Y/N, Anne and Gemma were at this really nice restaurant, ordering their food and chatting about his second album. Everything was just fine before she started explaining to the waiter how she wanted her salad. Maybe it was her cute smile and the immediate clicking between her and the guy or the fact that he looked slightly older and more musculine then Harry, but something triggered it all and he couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Gemma was babbling about her sunglasses line when he felt it. The feeling of jealousy was just starting to make his blood bubble in his veins. His fists were clenched under the table as he was trying his best not to bend her over his thighs right there and then. </p><p>\u201cAnd if you add some nutmeg it would just be perfect\u201d, he heard his girlfriend saying, touching the waiter\u2019s biceps.</p><p>On the badge on his suit was written Ash. So Ash was the bastard\u2019s name. Harry could see him looking at Y/N\u2019s cleavage whenever she turned to the menu in her hands. </p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you\u201d he cut their chit-chat, taking the menu and giving it to the waiter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything else to order at this moment.\u201d</p><p>Anne and Gemma stopped talking then and the three women looked at him, suprised by his attitude.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d Y/N asked, looking annoyed with him. \u201cI was just telling him to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, to put some nutmeg in your salad, we got it. That doesn\u2019t need to take three hundred years and that much of talking. I wonder how he didn\u2019t pull a chair from the nearest table to sit down with us and explain why the nutmeg is so important in a salad.\u201d</p><p>Gemma laughed but cut it short when he shot her a look. He didn\u2019t come here only for them all to make a fool out of him. It wasn\u2019t funny, all of this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><p>But before Y/N could say \u201cjealous\u201d, he started his angry talk again:\u201cYes, i\u2019m very hungry. And as much as he was sitting there and doing nothing, as much i was going to wait for my food. Don\u2019t know about you two, but i don\u2019t have time for such shit as types of salads and the right spices for them.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was just about to say something in return but he put his hand over her knee and she closed her mouth. She knew this look in his eyes very well - he wasn\u2019t hungry, he was jealous. And if she started an argument about it, it was going to make it all worse for her.</p><p>So all of them returned to what they were doing before all of this happened - Anne and Gemma started talking about the multiple sunglasses designs, Harry took a long sip of his glass of water and Y/N tried to at least not look that distracted by the way her boyfriend\u2019s hand was going up and down on her thigh, slightly lifting her dress.</p><p>A few minutes after Ash came back with Y/N\u2019s goddamn salad, Gemma and Anne\u2019s beef and lamp chops, and said that Harry\u2019s order might take a little longer because his choice wasn\u2019t really the easiest and quickest to prepare. Harry nearly lost all of his composure when the guy took a last look at Y/N\u2019s cleavage and turned on his heels, walking away.</p><p>The whole evening he was in a very bad mood, easily irritated by every single thing in the restaurant and not really satisfied with his food choice. So when the fucking bastard finally took their bill and didn\u2019t even dare to look at his girlfriend because of his life treathening grimace, he couldn\u2019t wait to go to his mother\u2019s house, get alone with his girlfriend and show her why it\u2019s not so good to flirt with other guys. Especially in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight\u201d Gemma wished them as they were arrived at the house and everyone was going in their separate rooms to get some sleep.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Gem\u201d Y/N wished back and looked at Harry who didn\u2019t even bother to turn around and wish sweet dream to his sister. She waited for her to turn around the corner before saying:\u201cI really think you should be nicer to people, H. Sometimes you have perfect manners and at some other times you completely forget how normal people interact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh of course, excuse me, ma'am. I should of asked you if you prefer your salad with some nutmeg in it, shouldn\u2019t i?\u201d He laughed at her, going to the nightstand and turning off the lamp.</p><p>\u201cGet over it, Harry! Yes, i was talking to Ash and what has that to do with you, wishing goodnight to Gemma? Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh!?\u201d He nearly shouted. \u201cIs that how far you two have gotten. Did you give him your number?\u201d</p><p>Y/N wanted to say he was being ridiculous, which he perfectly realised at that same moment, but then he grabbed her by the waist and pulled her closer so her back was pressed to his chest. He leaned into her and whispered in her ear:\u201cUndress. Now. And get down on your knees for daddy\u201d.</p><p>She huried to do what he ordered, not wanting to get him even angrier. She knew pretty well she had stepped on his last nerve and pushed his last button a while ago so it wasn\u2019t really the time to put on a stupid fight. And if she made him cum just from her mouth, maybe she was gonna get to cum as well tonight.</p><p>\u201cHands behind your back. Don\u2019t even dare to touch daddy\u2019s cock, the little slut that you are doesn\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019m going to fuck your chit-chatting mouth and than, if you\u2019re good enough for me, i might make you cum. Now open up.\u201d</p><p>He parted her lips with his cock, not giving two shits if she\u2019s ready to take all of him in one go and not giving her time to readjust, got a hold of her ponytail and slipped fully into her warm mouth. She gagged at first as she felt him touching the back of her throat but she didn\u2019t really have much time to prepare because he started trusting in her mouth, not really succeeding to hide his own moans.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying this as much as daddy does, hm?\u201d He growled as he felt her swallowing her saliva around him. \u201cBeen thirsty for daddy\u2019s cum all evening, that\u2019s why you started acting like a little slut.\u201d</p><p>And he was speaking the truth itself, they both knew it. But Anne who was just at the other side of the door didn\u2019t. So when she opened it, her eyes nearly popped out of her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKids-\u201d, she paused mid-sentence as she saw her son, who she thought she teached how to properly treat girls, trusting roughtly in his girlfriend\u2019s mouth and pulling her hair.</p><p>The door was quickly closed again and before Y/N and Harry could even proceed what just happened, they heard his mother\u2019s footsteps down the corridor. Harry let go off of his girlfriend\u2019s hair and pulled away, lifting his pants and helping her zip her dress. They walked in dead silence to Anne\u2019s room and both of them were already thinking what to say to her as they knocked on the door but nobody answered.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Harry asked, sounding like a guilty little boy. \u201cMom, can we at least come into your room and explain all of this to you? I swear i wasn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She sounded disgusted with him. \u201cIt\u2019s locked, don\u2019t even try. Go away!\u201d</p><p>Y/N and Harry looked at each other in confusion, wondering what to do now when his mother saw their midnight activities. They returned to their bedroom and went to bed, but not before they promised each other to explain everything to her in the morning. If she didn\u2019t look at them like at freaks, of course.</p><p>But when the morning soon came and they found her and Gemma in the living room, they had no idea how to get her attention. The both of them were watching some culinary TV show and looked as if they would rather die but not talk to them.</p><p>\u201cMom\u201d Harry tried again, sitting next to her this time. \u201cMom, can we and Y/N talk to you in the kitchen for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know as well\u201d Gemma said, looking worriedly at her brother\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cI want to hear the explanation, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t hurting me\u201d Y/N started, not liking the sceptical look in their eyes. \u201cI swear, he wasn\u2019t. He never would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what an abused woman would say about her abuser!\u201d Anne laughed at her. \u201cHoney-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me. Your son is a perfect gentleman. We just like things more\u2026 rough in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow rough do you guys get?\u201d Gemma snorted.</p><p>\u201cWell, a little spanking\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N was just going to say \u201cnever hurt somebody\u201d, but then she looked at Harry and got the picture. They weren\u2019t really doing a very good job of convincing them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how we like to do it. It\u2019s not always like that. Sometimes It\u2019s quite romantic and slow, and sensual\u2026 but this is how we like it best. And there isn\u2019t anything wrong about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least do you return the favor?\u201d Anne asked her son, still a little confused but slowly starting to calm down.</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>Y/N nodded in agreement. She couldn\u2019t help\u00a0but remember that one night about a week ago when he went down on her. She came three times in a row.</p><p>\u201cOkat, let\u2019s close the topic with this and never open it again.\u201d Gemma cut them off. \u201cNow go or sit and stay quite. I want to watch Jamie Oliver cook.\u201d</p>",

Xx</p><p>\u2014\u00a0</p><p>That night Harry was so mad because of her, flirting with the waiter, he could hardly contain himself. He, Y/N, Anne and Gemma were at this really nice restaurant, ordering their food and chatting about his second album. Everything was just fine before she started explaining to the waiter how she wanted her salad. Maybe it was her cute smile and the immediate clicking between her and the guy or the fact that he looked slightly older and more musculine then Harry, but something triggered it all and he couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Gemma was babbling about her sunglasses line when he felt it. The feeling of jealousy was just starting to make his blood bubble in his veins. His fists were clenched under the table as he was trying his best not to bend her over his thighs right there and then. </p><p>\u201cAnd if you add some nutmeg it would just be perfect\u201d, he heard his girlfriend saying, touching the waiter\u2019s biceps.</p><p>On the badge on his suit was written Ash. So Ash was the bastard\u2019s name. Harry could see him looking at Y/N\u2019s cleavage whenever she turned to the menu in her hands. </p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you\u201d he cut their chit-chat, taking the menu and giving it to the waiter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything else to order at this moment.\u201d</p><p>Anne and Gemma stopped talking then and the three women looked at him, suprised by his attitude.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d Y/N asked, looking annoyed with him. \u201cI was just telling him to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, to put some nutmeg in your salad, we got it. That doesn\u2019t need to take three hundred years and that much of talking. I wonder how he didn\u2019t pull a chair from the nearest table to sit down with us and explain why the nutmeg is so important in a salad.\u201d</p><p>Gemma laughed but cut it short when he shot her a look. He didn\u2019t come here only for them all to make a fool out of him. It wasn\u2019t funny, all of this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><p>But before Y/N could say \u201cjealous\u201d, he started his angry talk again:\u201cYes, i\u2019m very hungry. And as much as he was sitting there and doing nothing, as much i was going to wait for my food. Don\u2019t know about you two, but i don\u2019t have time for such shit as types of salads and the right spices for them.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was just about to say something in return but he put his hand over her knee and she closed her mouth. She knew this look in his eyes very well - he wasn\u2019t hungry, he was jealous. And if she started an argument about it, it was going to make it all worse for her.</p><p>So all of them returned to what they were doing before all of this happened - Anne and Gemma started talking about the multiple sunglasses designs, Harry took a long sip of his glass of water and Y/N tried to at least not look that distracted by the way her boyfriend\u2019s hand was going up and down on her thigh, slightly lifting her dress.</p><p>A few minutes after Ash came back with Y/N\u2019s goddamn salad, Gemma and Anne\u2019s beef and lamp chops, and said that Harry\u2019s order might take a little longer because his choice wasn\u2019t really the easiest and quickest to prepare. Harry nearly lost all of his composure when the guy took a last look at Y/N\u2019s cleavage and turned on his heels, walking away.</p><p>The whole evening he was in a very bad mood, easily irritated by every single thing in the restaurant and not really satisfied with his food choice. So when the fucking bastard finally took their bill and didn\u2019t even dare to look at his girlfriend because of his life treathening grimace, he couldn\u2019t wait to go to his mother\u2019s house, get alone with his girlfriend and show her why it\u2019s not so good to flirt with other guys. Especially in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight\u201d Gemma wished them as they were arrived at the house and everyone was going in their separate rooms to get some sleep.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Gem\u201d Y/N wished back and looked at Harry who didn\u2019t even bother to turn around and wish sweet dream to his sister. She waited for her to turn around the corner before saying:\u201cI really think you should be nicer to people, H. Sometimes you have perfect manners and at some other times you completely forget how normal people interact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh of course, excuse me, ma'am. I should of asked you if you prefer your salad with some nutmeg in it, shouldn\u2019t i?\u201d He laughed at her, going to the nightstand and turning off the lamp.</p><p>\u201cGet over it, Harry! Yes, i was talking to Ash and what has that to do with you, wishing goodnight to Gemma? Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh!?\u201d He nearly shouted. \u201cIs that how far you two have gotten. Did you give him your number?\u201d</p><p>Y/N wanted to say he was being ridiculous, which he perfectly realised at that same moment, but then he grabbed her by the waist and pulled her closer so her back was pressed to his chest. He leaned into her and whispered in her ear:\u201cUndress. Now. And get down on your knees for daddy\u201d.</p><p>She huried to do what he ordered, not wanting to get him even angrier. She knew pretty well she had stepped on his last nerve and pushed his last button a while ago so it wasn\u2019t really the time to put on a stupid fight. And if she made him cum just from her mouth, maybe she was gonna get to cum as well tonight.</p><p>\u201cHands behind your back. Don\u2019t even dare to touch daddy\u2019s cock, the little slut that you are doesn\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019m going to fuck your chit-chatting mouth and than, if you\u2019re good enough for me, i might make you cum. Now open up.\u201d</p><p>He parted her lips with his cock, not giving two shits if she\u2019s ready to take all of him in one go and not giving her time to readjust, got a hold of her ponytail and slipped fully into her warm mouth. She gagged at first as she felt him touching the back of her throat but she didn\u2019t really have much time to prepare because he started trusting in her mouth, not really succeeding to hide his own moans.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying this as much as daddy does, hm?\u201d He growled as he felt her swallowing her saliva around him. \u201cBeen thirsty for daddy\u2019s cum all evening, that\u2019s why you started acting like a little slut.\u201d</p><p>And he was speaking the truth itself, they both knew it. But Anne who was just at the other side of the door didn\u2019t. So when she opened it, her eyes nearly popped out of her head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKids-\u201d, she paused mid-sentence as she saw her son, who she thought she teached how to properly treat girls, trusting roughtly in his girlfriend\u2019s mouth and pulling her hair.</p><p>The door was quickly closed again and before Y/N and Harry could even proceed what just happened, they heard his mother\u2019s footsteps down the corridor. Harry let go off of his girlfriend\u2019s hair and pulled away, lifting his pants and helping her zip her dress. They walked in dead silence to Anne\u2019s room and both of them were already thinking what to say to her as they knocked on the door but nobody answered.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Harry asked, sounding like a guilty little boy. \u201cMom, can we at least come into your room and explain all of this to you? I swear i wasn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She sounded disgusted with him. \u201cIt\u2019s locked, don\u2019t even try. Go away!\u201d</p><p>Y/N and Harry looked at each other in confusion, wondering what to do now when his mother saw their midnight activities. They returned to their bedroom and went to bed, but not before they promised each other to explain everything to her in the morning. If she didn\u2019t look at them like at freaks, of course.</p><p>But when the morning soon came and they found her and Gemma in the living room, they had no idea how to get her attention. The both of them were watching some culinary TV show and looked as if they would rather die but not talk to them.</p><p>\u201cMom\u201d Harry tried again, sitting next to her this time. \u201cMom, can we and Y/N talk to you in the kitchen for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know as well\u201d Gemma said, looking worriedly at her brother\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cI want to hear the explanation, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t hurting me\u201d Y/N started, not liking the sceptical look in their eyes. \u201cI swear, he wasn\u2019t. He never would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what an abused woman would say about her abuser!\u201d Anne laughed at her. \u201cHoney-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen to me. Your son is a perfect gentleman. We just like things more\u2026 rough in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow rough do you guys get?\u201d Gemma snorted.</p><p>\u201cWell, a little spanking\u2026\u201d</p><p>Y/N was just going to say \u201cnever hurt somebody\u201d, but then she looked at Harry and got the picture. They weren\u2019t really doing a very good job of convincing them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how we like to do it. It\u2019s not always like that. Sometimes It\u2019s quite romantic and slow, and sensual\u2026 but this is how we like it best. And there isn\u2019t anything wrong about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least do you return the favor?\u201d Anne asked her son, still a little confused but slowly starting to calm down.</p><p>\u201cOf course\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>Y/N nodded in agreement. She couldn\u2019t help\u00a0but remember that one night about a week ago when he went down on her. She came three times in a row.</p><p>\u201cOkat, let\u2019s close the topic with this and never open it again.\u201d Gemma cut them off. \u201cNow go or sit and stay quite. I want to watch Jamie Oliver cook.\u201d</p>",

It was weird how in a matter of months, this place had changed from feeling like home to feeling like <i>your mother\u2019s house </i>for you had been living with Harry for six months now and that feeling of comfort and safety you used to feel when you walked through your mother\u2019s door was the one you felt now when you closed the door of your shared apartment in London.\u00a0</p><p>You had kissed him goodbye the morning before you headed back home to visit your mum for a couple of days and now there she was, sitting down on her own chair, with her reading glasses on as she went through some of her patient\u2019s records. She stopped typing and turned her chair so she could have a good look at you though and you rolled your eyes playfully knowing the <i>visit </i>had just started.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by weird, hon?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She pursed her lips, the wrinkles around her eyes deepening as she narrowed her eyes the slightliest bit. She had managed to keep the garden as green as it was when you and your brother were still home and the fig tree was bearing the brunt of many figs that were just about ready to be picked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd sit down properly on your bottom, please.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Once again you rolled your eyes as a smirk tugged from your lips and you passed your legs over the armrest and sat down straight, just like Harry liked it as well <i>you\u2019re gonna hurt your back one of these days, m\u2019love.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI mean I got a cold a couple weeks ago when I went to the beach with Harry but I think it\u2019s been long enough for a cold to heal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt might be the flu, though.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not that time of the year but&hellip; The flu\u2019s never out of the table.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She stood up, wrapping her stethoscope around her neck before she stood right behind you grabbing your shoulders so she corrected your position. You couldn\u2019t stop smirking. She placed the stethoscope on your chest and asked you to take deep breaths.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBe careful though.\u201d You warned.\u00a0\u201cMy boobs hurt. I\u2019m waiting for my period.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWaiting?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, I should get it this week.\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe last week? I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ve been super stressed with work and Gem\u2019s wedding so I haven\u2019t been properly keeping track.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t see your mum slowly nodding, as if she had just seen all the truth in the world, and she almost wanted to hit your head with the stethoscope because <i>dear Lord how could her own daughter be so clueless?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re feeling tired?\u201d She asked, standing now next you so she could look into your eyes. You nodded.\u00a0\u201cAnd funny like sometimes you just wanna sleep and some other times you would eat everything in the fridge?\u201d You nodded again, opening your eyes wide because <i>man, that woman was a genius.\u00a0</i>\u201cAnd&hellip; You haven\u2019t gotten your period this month.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You just looked at her, completely in shock at what you now knew she was going to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen&hellip; I think it can only be two things.\u201d <i>So there\u2019s still hope, there\u2019s still hope&hellip;\u00a0</i>\u201cA boy or a girl.\u201d She chuckled, placing the stethoscope on the table before she turned at you.\u00a0\u201cOh, baby, have you guys not been using protection?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, yeah, of course we do! I take the pill.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cEvery single day, no exception?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d You frowned, standing up so you looked more serious and honorable, you thought.\u00a0\u201cI take the pill religiously. I mean I\u2019m 21 years old, madam, I wouldn\u2019t want to get pregnant and Harry\u2019s like super busy with his second album and&hellip; and&hellip; Already thinking about the second world tour and&hellip; I mean half his mates have daughters or sons so we know what that\u2019s like and I\u2019m not&hellip; I\u2019m not ready to be a mom.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You shook your head very fast and many times as if somehow you could get the pregnancy out of your mind if you moved your head enough. Your mum just smiled though and you hated that she wasn\u2019t freaking out like you so you frowned at her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy on Earth are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>She just laughed so you crossed your arms across your chest, completely flabbergasted at your mum\u2019s reaction. How was this funny to her? Her only daughter might be pregnant at the age of 21 and all she could cook was like&hellip; pasta but like the easy type, with cheese or tomato sauce tops, or like&hellip; ready-made soup. You were in no shape to bring a baby into this world.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be allright, kid.\u201d She placed her warm hand over your shoulder though and you just stayed there, looking ahead at the fig tree, watching a fig falling to the ground.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Harry called you that same night, apologizing for having bein such a caveman about your friendship with Adam. It was really so silly, you thought, that he would get jealous of Adam. Yes, you were good friends but dear Lord he was a married man and he was so obviously in love with his wife, it was unbelievable that Harry would get jealous of him. You had talked it out the night before you came up to your mum\u2019s house, but really his jealousy had been the reason why you needed to come up to your hometown for a while, because lately everything was feeling weird for you. He asked about how you were feeling too, concern evident on his voice, but you didn\u2019t really cover the topic of your mum\u2019s suspicion or the conversation at all. You laughed way too loud at his terrible jokes and even he frowned at your reaction, smirking and asking why you were acting <i>so euphoric, baby; </i>but you didn\u2019t tell him anything because there was nothing to tell anyway. You hadn\u2019t even taken the pregnancy test and why worry him when there was no need, right? You didn\u2019t need to tell him just yet anyways&hellip; <i>How did it go? Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m having your baby, it\u2019s NONE of your bussiness, right?\u00a0</i></p><p>You stayed with your mum for another day and even though you had rejected her many attempts of persuasiong for you to take the test, she had managed to calm you down about the whole possible pregnancy thing. She always did that- make things easier- and right then you thought if you were ever going to be a mum, at least you would have the best role model. As you drove back home, the indie playlist Harry had made for you filling your ears, you kept listening to your mum\u2019s words as if they were written somewhere in the car. <i>There are many options, love, and you can always decide not to be a mother just yet. Abortion is another valid choice, you know that, right? This is your life and no one has the right to judge you or act like they know better. You know Harry\u2019ll be there for you either way- otherwise your brother will kick his ass.\u00a0</i></p><p>Yet Harry wasn\u2019t home when you got there and as much as you wanted to see him, you were also glad you could have a moment to yourself so you could at least think about the way of approaching this. Throwing your dirty clothes to the laundry basket, you frowned when you grabbed a small carton in your duffle bag. A pregnancy test- s<i>mooth, mum- </i>with a post-it note stick to it <i>\u201cYou won\u2019t have an excuse not to tell him after you take the test, love.\u201d\u00a0</i>You rolled your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>But you guessed she was right&hellip; So you closed the bathroom door, even though you were alone, and you took it., your hand shaking as you held it exactly where you needed it to be. You were going to tell him anyway. If it was positive, then you would ask him to sit down on the couch and you would tell him- somehow, that you were carrying his baby; and if it was negative then you would have a laugh about it over a salad- now that he was acting like a health freak again- later tonight.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>You looked at yourself in the mirror. Positive. You covered your belly with your hands. Positive. It was now flat but in a matter of months it would be all round and swollen and there will be a baby in there- well technically, there was already a baby in there, but it must be so tiny they didn\u2019t need any extra room just yet. And not just any baby but Harry\u2019s, Harry\u2019s baby was in your belly. You tried to swallow the lump in your throat as tears fell down your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>You were only 21 years old. Looking at yourself in the mirror, for the first time you realized how much you still looked like a girl. You frowned. You imagined yourself sitting down on the living room floor trying to play with those small, colourful toys that babies had with a little boy, about 10 months old, with brown curly hair and green eyes. You imagined yourself feeding him in a high chair in the kitchen, taking him to the park, playing with him on the snow, swimming with him at the beach and then you imagined waking up in the middle of the night to a crying baby that wouldn\u2019t settle with anything.\u00a0</p><p>You imagined Harry being gone, but he was just 24 years old, he was living his dream, having the time of his life and you were not about to ruin that for him with a boring family life, driving up to your mum\u2019s house to have lunch with her every second sunday. And yet you couldn\u2019t raise a child on your own either. Gosh, you didn\u2019t even know how to properly iron your clothes, how were you going to iron onesies? And alone at that? Was that what you wanted anyway? To have a family and be alone half the time? What would you do when your son missed his daddy?\u00a0</p><p>You were holding the positive pregnancy test in your hands when Adam walked in. Harry had called him and he had said you would appreciate it if he popped over at home and have lunch with you or something for he was so busy with Gemma\u2019s wedding he couldn\u2019t escape to see you until later tonight. He wanted you to know he was okay with it, he wanted to train himself so he could be okay with it for real and Adam had come over to pick you up and had called for you around the house but when he couldn\u2019t find you he had made his way upstairs and had seen you, sitting on the bed and holding a pregnancy test. <i>Holy cow.\u00a0</i></p><p>He had promised not to tell Harry though. He had <i>strongly encouraged you </i>to tell him- to put it nicely- but you knew you could trust him and you knew he wouldn\u2019t tell him if you didn\u2019t want him to. He was your closest friend out of Harry\u2019s band\u00a0 but you knew your closeness with Adam was still a touchy subject for your boyfriend, it bothered him sometimes, so if it were to find out Adam out of all people knew about your pregnancy before he did, he would lose it, you were sure. You could get all arrogant again, and throw that speech at him that jealousy was just insecurities and that he had no fucking reason to be insecure because he was a Greek god, but then you would be being hypocritical because&hellip; Well because it had also bothered you sometimes how close he seemed to be with Ursula, his new hairstylist. It was stupid, but you couldn\u2019t help it when he was away and you were home and you thought about the two of them laughing in playful banter before the concerts.\u00a0</p><p>You decided you\u2019d throw the pregnancy test away before you and Adam left for lunch- last thing you needed was Harry finding it somewhere and freaking out. All throughout lunch, Adam couldn\u2019t stop smiling as he coaxed you into telling Harry because <i>he would be so happy, Y/N, damn it, that boy is so in love with you!\u00a0</i>\u00a0And after a lot of rolling your eyes and a lot of hitting his arm, you had decided to go grocery shopping so you could cook a nice dinner and tell Harry over a nice glass of wine.\u00a0</p><p>After a long day of walking around London with his mum and sister, he had come home in a rush to an empty house, expecting his hairstylist to knock on the door any minute now. He had called her over so they could talk about his sister\u2019s wedding, see if he could count on her to do her hair, and now they were making lemonade as they went over the dates and stuff. Ursula froze on the spot when, holding the remnants of the lemons on her hands, she saw the positive pregnancy test lying there on the bin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d She frowned. \u201cCongrats by the way.\u201d She raised her eyebrows, pursing her lips as she placed the lemonade in front of Harry.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOn the child!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat child?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>She frowned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a positive pregnancy test on the bin.\u201d She whispered.\u00a0\u201cI thought you knew.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He stood up from the table, frowning in bewilderment before he made his way towards the bin. He bent over, grasping the test on his hand and staring at it with impossible thoughts burning on his mind. <i>You didn\u2019t tell him anything? You sure had been acting weird but.. He never thought&hellip; Why didn\u2019t you tell him? </i>He started thinking about all the little things you had said and all the little things you had done but he didn\u2019t see any hints on your part, or anything out of line really.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Ursula noted.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He looked up at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe&hellip; Maybe it\u2019s not hers?\u201d She bit her bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cMaybe it\u2019s&hellip; a friend\u2019s of hers?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugged, unconvinced.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell it might not even be yours.\u201d She laughed and Harry frowned.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell if it\u2019s a friend\u2019s of hers is definitely not mine.\u201d He joked along and she shrugged.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou never know these days.\u201d She shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI mean with all the time we spend away&hellip; That\u2019d explain why she hasn\u2019t told you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Harry glared at her, his jaw clenched and his shoulders tensed as his fist curled around the positive test. He had a feeling it was yours, how unlikely was it anyway that a friend of yours would come to your place to take a fucking pregnancy test? And what friend anyway? Nancy was single and Eve was a lesbian. Of course they could get pregnant still but it was less likely than Y/N&hellip; Even though she took the pill, didn\u2019t she?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Y/N\u2019s then it\u2019s mine.\u201d He was sure of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, man, relax.\u201d She chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI was just saying. I mean just&hellip; She hasn\u2019t told you, has she? That\u2019s weird. I mean I would tell you- I mean my boyfriend- even before I took the test, you know? I mean&hellip; Listen, H, I\u2019m just looking out for you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to look out for me when it comes about Y/N.\u201d It was clear he was mad.\u00a0\u201cWhat she and I have&hellip; You just don\u2019t get it if you think for one second she would cheat on me. Now, I don\u2019t want to be rude and gosh I know you didn\u2019t mean it but&hellip; I think you should leave. I didn\u2019t like the way you talked about my girlfriend.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry but if the kid doesn\u2019t look anything like you, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d She rolled her eyes before she left.\u00a0<br/></p><p>She bumped your shoulder as she walked out the door and Harry rushed to keep the test on the cutlery drawer, cursing himself when he realized what he had done. You smiled at him before giving him a peck on the lips as you placed the bags on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot you avocados.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened with Ursula by the way? I know you said she didn\u2019t hate me but she-\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe had a fight.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou&hellip; You had a fight?\u201d You frowned, thinking <i>he wouldn\u2019t fight if he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</i>\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, she&hellip; She said something she shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cShe was wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter. How was your day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He kept the fruits and the yogurts on the fridge as you kept taking things out of the bags.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was good.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cHow was-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you carry that bag all the way to the flat?\u201d He closed the fridge, resting his hand on the counter next to the bags and looking closely at your face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, yeah?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a big girl, H.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be carrying that much weight.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You swallowed. You were surely just being paranoid. He couldn\u2019t know. Adam wouldn\u2019t have told him- he would have told you if he had. He was surely just saying that, just like he told you not to go to bed with your hair all wet or to eat <i>something else </i>when you had spent a week eating soup. His green eyes stared into your own before you turned around and started keeping things on the pantry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Y/N?\u201d His figure followed you closely.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You turned around and sighed, rubbing your forehead with your fingertips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that heavy-\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say to me?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>He knew. For the love of God, how could he know?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYes, I found your pink Gucci t-shirt. It was on the-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d He cut you short, his green eyes staring sternly into your own.\u00a0</p><p>You couldn\u2019t read his expression, but he didn\u2019t seem too thrilled about it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he told you.\u201d You snapped, covering your face with your hands.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d He frowned.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d You yelled.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me now, Harry, I really don\u2019t need you to-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d He frowned, raising his voice himself.\u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s fucking true! Is it Adam\u2019s? You\u2019re having Adam\u2019s baby?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You yelled.\u00a0\u201cHow dare you say something like that?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, right, I\u2019m not as stupid as you thought I was! You&hellip; Ursula was fucking right and here I was like a fucking idiot defending you!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat in the world are you saying? Do you seriously think I would cheat on you? Is that what you think of me, really?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow could I not?! You\u2019ve been acting so strange lately, all distant and fuck and then I found a fucking pregnancy test on the bin and&hellip; How long have you known for?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter? You really think I would cheat on you with your friend! I can\u2019t believe you think that of me, Harry. I thought you trusted me!\u201d You snapped.\u00a0\u201cAnd yet here you are, believing fucking Ursula over me? And it just had to be her, hadn\u2019t it? Just so you know Harry, I would never, ever cheat on you! You\u2019re everything I\u2019ve ever wanted and I love you, fuck,so knowing that\u2019s what you think of me fucking hurts, Harry! The baby is yours! Of course is yours you idiot!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I was scared! I am terrified! And maybe I\u2019m so scared because I don\u2019t know if I want to raise a baby with you!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>His frown deepened, his green eyes getting glossy as he tried to hold your gaze. Your jaw was clenched and you had never been madder in your entire life so you looked challenging, as if you didn\u2019t regret what you had said one bit. He didn\u2019t know what hurt him more, the words you had said or the fact that he had brought this upon himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd&hellip;\u201d You got back at it\u00a0\u201cMaybe that is because I am not sure about a future with you!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNeither do I!\u201d You finished.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGoodbye then!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>",

            "comment": "<p><i>A/N: A little thing about Y/N not being ready to be a mom and Harry being clueless!\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling weird lately.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You rested your back against the old, almost vintage, white metal chair of your mother\u2019s garden. It was weird how in a matter of months, this place had changed from feeling like home to feeling like <i>your mother\u2019s house </i>for you had been living with Harry for six months now and that feeling of comfort and safety you used to feel when you walked through your mother\u2019s door was the one you felt now when you closed the door of your shared apartment in London.\u00a0</p><p>You had kissed him goodbye the morning before you headed back home to visit your mum for a couple of days and now there she was, sitting down on her own chair, with her reading glasses on as she went through some of her patient\u2019s records. She stopped typing and turned her chair so she could have a good look at you though and you rolled your eyes playfully knowing the <i>visit </i>had just started.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by weird, hon?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She pursed her lips, the wrinkles around her eyes deepening as she narrowed her eyes the slightliest bit. She had managed to keep the garden as green as it was when you and your brother were still home and the fig tree was bearing the brunt of many figs that were just about ready to be picked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd sit down properly on your bottom, please.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Once again you rolled your eyes as a smirk tugged from your lips and you passed your legs over the armrest and sat down straight, just like Harry liked it as well <i>you\u2019re gonna hurt your back one of these days, m\u2019love.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI mean I got a cold a couple weeks ago when I went to the beach with Harry but I think it\u2019s been long enough for a cold to heal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt might be the flu, though.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not that time of the year but\u2026 The flu\u2019s never out of the table.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She stood up, wrapping her stethoscope around her neck before she stood right behind you grabbing your shoulders so she corrected your position. You couldn\u2019t stop smirking. She placed the stethoscope on your chest and asked you to take deep breaths.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBe careful though.\u201d You warned.\u00a0\u201cMy boobs hurt. I\u2019m waiting for my period.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWaiting?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUh, I should get it this week.\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe last week? I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ve been super stressed with work and Gem\u2019s wedding so I haven\u2019t been properly keeping track.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t see your mum slowly nodding, as if she had just seen all the truth in the world, and she almost wanted to hit your head with the stethoscope because <i>dear Lord how could her own daughter be so clueless?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re feeling tired?\u201d She asked, standing now next you so she could look into your eyes. You nodded.\u00a0\u201cAnd funny like sometimes you just wanna sleep and some other times you would eat everything in the fridge?\u201d You nodded again, opening your eyes wide because <i>man, that woman was a genius.\u00a0</i>\u201cAnd\u2026 You haven\u2019t gotten your period this month.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You just looked at her, completely in shock at what you now knew she was going to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen\u2026 I think it can only be two things.\u201d <i>So there\u2019s still hope, there\u2019s still hope\u2026\u00a0</i>\u201cA boy or a girl.\u201d She chuckled, placing the stethoscope on the table before she turned at you.\u00a0\u201cOh, baby, have you guys not been using protection?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, yeah, of course we do! I take the pill.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEvery single day, no exception?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d You frowned, standing up so you looked more serious and honorable, you thought.\u00a0\u201cI take the pill religiously. I mean I\u2019m 21 years old, madam, I wouldn\u2019t want to get pregnant and Harry\u2019s like super busy with his second album and\u2026 and\u2026 Already thinking about the second world tour and\u2026 I mean half his mates have daughters or sons so we know what that\u2019s like and I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not ready to be a mom.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You shook your head very fast and many times as if somehow you could get the pregnancy out of your mind if you moved your head enough. Your mum just smiled though and you hated that she wasn\u2019t freaking out like you so you frowned at her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy on Earth are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She just laughed so you crossed your arms across your chest, completely flabbergasted at your mum\u2019s reaction. How was this funny to her? Her only daughter might be pregnant at the age of 21 and all she could cook was like\u2026 pasta but like the easy type, with cheese or tomato sauce tops, or like\u2026 ready-made soup. You were in no shape to bring a baby into this world.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be allright, kid.\u201d She placed her warm hand over your shoulder though and you just stayed there, looking ahead at the fig tree, watching a fig falling to the ground.\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry called you that same night, apologizing for having bein such a caveman about your friendship with Adam. It was really so silly, you thought, that he would get jealous of Adam. Yes, you were good friends but dear Lord he was a married man and he was so obviously in love with his wife, it was unbelievable that Harry would get jealous of him. You had talked it out the night before you came up to your mum\u2019s house, but really his jealousy had been the reason why you needed to come up to your hometown for a while, because lately everything was feeling weird for you. He asked about how you were feeling too, concern evident on his voice, but you didn\u2019t really cover the topic of your mum\u2019s suspicion or the conversation at all. You laughed way too loud at his terrible jokes and even he frowned at your reaction, smirking and asking why you were acting <i>so euphoric, baby; </i>but you didn\u2019t tell him anything because there was nothing to tell anyway. You hadn\u2019t even taken the pregnancy test and why worry him when there was no need, right? You didn\u2019t need to tell him just yet anyways\u2026 <i>How did it go? Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m having your baby, it\u2019s NONE of your bussiness, right?\u00a0</i></p><p>You stayed with your mum for another day and even though you had rejected her many attempts of persuasiong for you to take the test, she had managed to calm you down about the whole possible pregnancy thing. She always did that- make things easier- and right then you thought if you were ever going to be a mum, at least you would have the best role model. As you drove back home, the indie playlist Harry had made for you filling your ears, you kept listening to your mum\u2019s words as if they were written somewhere in the car. <i>There are many options, love, and you can always decide not to be a mother just yet. Abortion is another valid choice, you know that, right? This is your life and no one has the right to judge you or act like they know better. You know Harry\u2019ll be there for you either way- otherwise your brother will kick his ass.\u00a0</i></p><p>Yet Harry wasn\u2019t home when you got there and as much as you wanted to see him, you were also glad you could have a moment to yourself so you could at least think about the way of approaching this. Throwing your dirty clothes to the laundry basket, you frowned when you grabbed a small carton in your duffle bag. A pregnancy test- s<i>mooth, mum- </i>with a post-it note stick to it <i>\u201cYou won\u2019t have an excuse not to tell him after you take the test, love.\u201d\u00a0</i>You rolled your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>But you guessed she was right\u2026 So you closed the bathroom door, even though you were alone, and you took it., your hand shaking as you held it exactly where you needed it to be. You were going to tell him anyway. If it was positive, then you would ask him to sit down on the couch and you would tell him- somehow, that you were carrying his baby; and if it was negative then you would have a laugh about it over a salad- now that he was acting like a health freak again- later tonight.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>You looked at yourself in the mirror. Positive. You covered your belly with your hands. Positive. It was now flat but in a matter of months it would be all round and swollen and there will be a baby in there- well technically, there was already a baby in there, but it must be so tiny they didn\u2019t need any extra room just yet. And not just any baby but Harry\u2019s, Harry\u2019s baby was in your belly. You tried to swallow the lump in your throat as tears fell down your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>You were only 21 years old. Looking at yourself in the mirror, for the first time you realized how much you still looked like a girl. You frowned. You imagined yourself sitting down on the living room floor trying to play with those small, colourful toys that babies had with a little boy, about 10 months old, with brown curly hair and green eyes. You imagined yourself feeding him in a high chair in the kitchen, taking him to the park, playing with him on the snow, swimming with him at the beach and then you imagined waking up in the middle of the night to a crying baby that wouldn\u2019t settle with anything.\u00a0</p><p>You imagined Harry being gone, but he was just 24 years old, he was living his dream, having the time of his life and you were not about to ruin that for him with a boring family life, driving up to your mum\u2019s house to have lunch with her every second sunday. And yet you couldn\u2019t raise a child on your own either. Gosh, you didn\u2019t even know how to properly iron your clothes, how were you going to iron onesies? And alone at that? Was that what you wanted anyway? To have a family and be alone half the time? What would you do when your son missed his daddy?\u00a0</p><p>You were holding the positive pregnancy test in your hands when Adam walked in. Harry had called him and he had said you would appreciate it if he popped over at home and have lunch with you or something for he was so busy with Gemma\u2019s wedding he couldn\u2019t escape to see you until later tonight. He wanted you to know he was okay with it, he wanted to train himself so he could be okay with it for real and Adam had come over to pick you up and had called for you around the house but when he couldn\u2019t find you he had made his way upstairs and had seen you, sitting on the bed and holding a pregnancy test. <i>Holy cow.\u00a0</i></p><p>He had promised not to tell Harry though. He had <i>strongly encouraged you </i>to tell him- to put it nicely- but you knew you could trust him and you knew he wouldn\u2019t tell him if you didn\u2019t want him to. He was your closest friend out of Harry\u2019s band\u00a0 but you knew your closeness with Adam was still a touchy subject for your boyfriend, it bothered him sometimes, so if it were to find out Adam out of all people knew about your pregnancy before he did, he would lose it, you were sure. You could get all arrogant again, and throw that speech at him that jealousy was just insecurities and that he had no fucking reason to be insecure because he was a Greek god, but then you would be being hypocritical because\u2026 Well because it had also bothered you sometimes how close he seemed to be with Ursula, his new hairstylist. It was stupid, but you couldn\u2019t help it when he was away and you were home and you thought about the two of them laughing in playful banter before the concerts.\u00a0</p><p>You decided you\u2019d throw the pregnancy test away before you and Adam left for lunch- last thing you needed was Harry finding it somewhere and freaking out. All throughout lunch, Adam couldn\u2019t stop smiling as he coaxed you into telling Harry because <i>he would be so happy, Y/N, damn it, that boy is so in love with you!\u00a0</i>\u00a0And after a lot of rolling your eyes and a lot of hitting his arm, you had decided to go grocery shopping so you could cook a nice dinner and tell Harry over a nice glass of wine.\u00a0</p><p>After a long day of walking around London with his mum and sister, he had come home in a rush to an empty house, expecting his hairstylist to knock on the door any minute now. He had called her over so they could talk about his sister\u2019s wedding, see if he could count on her to do her hair, and now they were making lemonade as they went over the dates and stuff. Ursula froze on the spot when, holding the remnants of the lemons on her hands, she saw the positive pregnancy test lying there on the bin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d She frowned. \u201cCongrats by the way.\u201d She raised her eyebrows, pursing her lips as she placed the lemonade in front of Harry.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOn the child!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat child?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She frowned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a positive pregnancy test on the bin.\u201d She whispered.\u00a0\u201cI thought you knew.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He stood up from the table, frowning in bewilderment before he made his way towards the bin. He bent over, grasping the test on his hand and staring at it with impossible thoughts burning on his mind. <i>You didn\u2019t tell him anything? You sure had been acting weird but.. He never thought\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you tell him? </i>He started thinking about all the little things you had said and all the little things you had done but he didn\u2019t see any hints on your part, or anything out of line really.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Ursula noted.\u00a0<br></p><p>He looked up at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s not hers?\u201d She bit her bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cMaybe it\u2019s\u2026 a friend\u2019s of hers?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugged, unconvinced.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell it might not even be yours.\u201d She laughed and Harry frowned.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell if it\u2019s a friend\u2019s of hers is definitely not mine.\u201d He joked along and she shrugged.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou never know these days.\u201d She shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI mean with all the time we spend away\u2026 That\u2019d explain why she hasn\u2019t told you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry glared at her, his jaw clenched and his shoulders tensed as his fist curled around the positive test. He had a feeling it was yours, how unlikely was it anyway that a friend of yours would come to your place to take a fucking pregnancy test? And what friend anyway? Nancy was single and Eve was a lesbian. Of course they could get pregnant still but it was less likely than Y/N\u2026 Even though she took the pill, didn\u2019t she?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Y/N\u2019s then it\u2019s mine.\u201d He was sure of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, man, relax.\u201d She chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI was just saying. I mean just\u2026 She hasn\u2019t told you, has she? That\u2019s weird. I mean I would tell you- I mean my boyfriend- even before I took the test, you know? I mean\u2026 Listen, H, I\u2019m just looking out for you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to look out for me when it comes about Y/N.\u201d It was clear he was mad.\u00a0\u201cWhat she and I have\u2026 You just don\u2019t get it if you think for one second she would cheat on me. Now, I don\u2019t want to be rude and gosh I know you didn\u2019t mean it but\u2026 I think you should leave. I didn\u2019t like the way you talked about my girlfriend.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry but if the kid doesn\u2019t look anything like you, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d She rolled her eyes before she left.\u00a0<br></p><p>She bumped your shoulder as she walked out the door and Harry rushed to keep the test on the cutlery drawer, cursing himself when he realized what he had done. You smiled at him before giving him a peck on the lips as you placed the bags on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot you avocados.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened with Ursula by the way? I know you said she didn\u2019t hate me but she-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe had a fight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You had a fight?\u201d You frowned, thinking <i>he wouldn\u2019t fight if he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</i>\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUh, she\u2026 She said something she shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cShe was wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter. How was your day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He kept the fruits and the yogurts on the fridge as you kept taking things out of the bags.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was good.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cHow was-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid you carry that bag all the way to the flat?\u201d He closed the fridge, resting his hand on the counter next to the bags and looking closely at your face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUh, yeah?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a big girl, H.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be carrying that much weight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You swallowed. You were surely just being paranoid. He couldn\u2019t know. Adam wouldn\u2019t have told him- he would have told you if he had. He was surely just saying that, just like he told you not to go to bed with your hair all wet or to eat <i>something else </i>when you had spent a week eating soup. His green eyes stared into your own before you turned around and started keeping things on the pantry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Y/N?\u201d His figure followed you closely.\u00a0<br></p><p>You turned around and sighed, rubbing your forehead with your fingertips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that heavy-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say to me?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><i>He knew. For the love of God, how could he know?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYes, I found your pink Gucci t-shirt. It was on the-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d He cut you short, his green eyes staring sternly into your own.\u00a0</p><p>You couldn\u2019t read his expression, but he didn\u2019t seem too thrilled about it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he told you.\u201d You snapped, covering your face with your hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d He frowned.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d You yelled.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me now, Harry, I really don\u2019t need you to-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d He frowned, raising his voice himself.\u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s fucking true! Is it Adam\u2019s? You\u2019re having Adam\u2019s baby?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You yelled.\u00a0\u201cHow dare you say something like that?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, right, I\u2019m not as stupid as you thought I was! You\u2026 Ursula was fucking right and here I was like a fucking idiot defending you!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat in the world are you saying? Do you seriously think I would cheat on you? Is that what you think of me, really?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow could I not?! You\u2019ve been acting so strange lately, all distant and fuck and then I found a fucking pregnancy test on the bin and\u2026 How long have you known for?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter? You really think I would cheat on you with your friend! I can\u2019t believe you think that of me, Harry. I thought you trusted me!\u201d You snapped.\u00a0\u201cAnd yet here you are, believing fucking Ursula over me? And it just had to be her, hadn\u2019t it? Just so you know Harry, I would never, ever cheat on you! You\u2019re everything I\u2019ve ever wanted and I love you, fuck,so knowing that\u2019s what you think of me fucking hurts, Harry! The baby is yours! Of course is yours you idiot!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I was scared! I am terrified! And maybe I\u2019m so scared because I don\u2019t know if I want to raise a baby with you!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>His frown deepened, his green eyes getting glossy as he tried to hold your gaze. Your jaw was clenched and you had never been madder in your entire life so you looked challenging, as if you didn\u2019t regret what you had said one bit. He didn\u2019t know what hurt him more, the words you had said or the fact that he had brought this upon himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d You got back at it\u00a0\u201cMaybe that is because I am not sure about a future with you!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNeither do I!\u201d You finished.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGoodbye then!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p>",

It was weird how in a matter of months, this place had changed from feeling like home to feeling like <i>your mother\u2019s house </i>for you had been living with Harry for six months now and that feeling of comfort and safety you used to feel when you walked through your mother\u2019s door was the one you felt now when you closed the door of your shared apartment in London.\u00a0</p><p>You had kissed him goodbye the morning before you headed back home to visit your mum for a couple of days and now there she was, sitting down on her own chair, with her reading glasses on as she went through some of her patient\u2019s records. She stopped typing and turned her chair so she could have a good look at you though and you rolled your eyes playfully knowing the <i>visit </i>had just started.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by weird, hon?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She pursed her lips, the wrinkles around her eyes deepening as she narrowed her eyes the slightliest bit. She had managed to keep the garden as green as it was when you and your brother were still home and the fig tree was bearing the brunt of many figs that were just about ready to be picked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd sit down properly on your bottom, please.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Once again you rolled your eyes as a smirk tugged from your lips and you passed your legs over the armrest and sat down straight, just like Harry liked it as well <i>you\u2019re gonna hurt your back one of these days, m\u2019love.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI mean I got a cold a couple weeks ago when I went to the beach with Harry but I think it\u2019s been long enough for a cold to heal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt might be the flu, though.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not that time of the year but\u2026 The flu\u2019s never out of the table.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She stood up, wrapping her stethoscope around her neck before she stood right behind you grabbing your shoulders so she corrected your position. You couldn\u2019t stop smirking. She placed the stethoscope on your chest and asked you to take deep breaths.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBe careful though.\u201d You warned.\u00a0\u201cMy boobs hurt. I\u2019m waiting for my period.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWaiting?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUh, I should get it this week.\u201d You nodded.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe last week? I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ve been super stressed with work and Gem\u2019s wedding so I haven\u2019t been properly keeping track.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t see your mum slowly nodding, as if she had just seen all the truth in the world, and she almost wanted to hit your head with the stethoscope because <i>dear Lord how could her own daughter be so clueless?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re feeling tired?\u201d She asked, standing now next you so she could look into your eyes. You nodded.\u00a0\u201cAnd funny like sometimes you just wanna sleep and some other times you would eat everything in the fridge?\u201d You nodded again, opening your eyes wide because <i>man, that woman was a genius.\u00a0</i>\u201cAnd\u2026 You haven\u2019t gotten your period this month.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You just looked at her, completely in shock at what you now knew she was going to say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen\u2026 I think it can only be two things.\u201d <i>So there\u2019s still hope, there\u2019s still hope\u2026\u00a0</i>\u201cA boy or a girl.\u201d She chuckled, placing the stethoscope on the table before she turned at you.\u00a0\u201cOh, baby, have you guys not been using protection?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, yeah, of course we do! I take the pill.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEvery single day, no exception?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d You frowned, standing up so you looked more serious and honorable, you thought.\u00a0\u201cI take the pill religiously. I mean I\u2019m 21 years old, madam, I wouldn\u2019t want to get pregnant and Harry\u2019s like super busy with his second album and\u2026 and\u2026 Already thinking about the second world tour and\u2026 I mean half his mates have daughters or sons so we know what that\u2019s like and I\u2019m not\u2026 I\u2019m not ready to be a mom.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You shook your head very fast and many times as if somehow you could get the pregnancy out of your mind if you moved your head enough. Your mum just smiled though and you hated that she wasn\u2019t freaking out like you so you frowned at her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy on Earth are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She just laughed so you crossed your arms across your chest, completely flabbergasted at your mum\u2019s reaction. How was this funny to her? Her only daughter might be pregnant at the age of 21 and all she could cook was like\u2026 pasta but like the easy type, with cheese or tomato sauce tops, or like\u2026 ready-made soup. You were in no shape to bring a baby into this world.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be allright, kid.\u201d She placed her warm hand over your shoulder though and you just stayed there, looking ahead at the fig tree, watching a fig falling to the ground.\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry called you that same night, apologizing for having bein such a caveman about your friendship with Adam. It was really so silly, you thought, that he would get jealous of Adam. Yes, you were good friends but dear Lord he was a married man and he was so obviously in love with his wife, it was unbelievable that Harry would get jealous of him. You had talked it out the night before you came up to your mum\u2019s house, but really his jealousy had been the reason why you needed to come up to your hometown for a while, because lately everything was feeling weird for you. He asked about how you were feeling too, concern evident on his voice, but you didn\u2019t really cover the topic of your mum\u2019s suspicion or the conversation at all. You laughed way too loud at his terrible jokes and even he frowned at your reaction, smirking and asking why you were acting <i>so euphoric, baby; </i>but you didn\u2019t tell him anything because there was nothing to tell anyway. You hadn\u2019t even taken the pregnancy test and why worry him when there was no need, right? You didn\u2019t need to tell him just yet anyways\u2026 <i>How did it go? Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m having your baby, it\u2019s NONE of your bussiness, right?\u00a0</i></p><p>You stayed with your mum for another day and even though you had rejected her many attempts of persuasiong for you to take the test, she had managed to calm you down about the whole possible pregnancy thing. She always did that- make things easier- and right then you thought if you were ever going to be a mum, at least you would have the best role model. As you drove back home, the indie playlist Harry had made for you filling your ears, you kept listening to your mum\u2019s words as if they were written somewhere in the car. <i>There are many options, love, and you can always decide not to be a mother just yet. Abortion is another valid choice, you know that, right? This is your life and no one has the right to judge you or act like they know better. You know Harry\u2019ll be there for you either way- otherwise your brother will kick his ass.\u00a0</i></p><p>Yet Harry wasn\u2019t home when you got there and as much as you wanted to see him, you were also glad you could have a moment to yourself so you could at least think about the way of approaching this. Throwing your dirty clothes to the laundry basket, you frowned when you grabbed a small carton in your duffle bag. A pregnancy test- s<i>mooth, mum- </i>with a post-it note stick to it <i>\u201cYou won\u2019t have an excuse not to tell him after you take the test, love.\u201d\u00a0</i>You rolled your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>But you guessed she was right\u2026 So you closed the bathroom door, even though you were alone, and you took it., your hand shaking as you held it exactly where you needed it to be. You were going to tell him anyway. If it was positive, then you would ask him to sit down on the couch and you would tell him- somehow, that you were carrying his baby; and if it was negative then you would have a laugh about it over a salad- now that he was acting like a health freak again- later tonight.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>Positive.\u00a0</p><p>You looked at yourself in the mirror. Positive. You covered your belly with your hands. Positive. It was now flat but in a matter of months it would be all round and swollen and there will be a baby in there- well technically, there was already a baby in there, but it must be so tiny they didn\u2019t need any extra room just yet. And not just any baby but Harry\u2019s, Harry\u2019s baby was in your belly. You tried to swallow the lump in your throat as tears fell down your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>You were only 21 years old. Looking at yourself in the mirror, for the first time you realized how much you still looked like a girl. You frowned. You imagined yourself sitting down on the living room floor trying to play with those small, colourful toys that babies had with a little boy, about 10 months old, with brown curly hair and green eyes. You imagined yourself feeding him in a high chair in the kitchen, taking him to the park, playing with him on the snow, swimming with him at the beach and then you imagined waking up in the middle of the night to a crying baby that wouldn\u2019t settle with anything.\u00a0</p><p>You imagined Harry being gone, but he was just 24 years old, he was living his dream, having the time of his life and you were not about to ruin that for him with a boring family life, driving up to your mum\u2019s house to have lunch with her every second sunday. And yet you couldn\u2019t raise a child on your own either. Gosh, you didn\u2019t even know how to properly iron your clothes, how were you going to iron onesies? And alone at that? Was that what you wanted anyway? To have a family and be alone half the time? What would you do when your son missed his daddy?\u00a0</p><p>You were holding the positive pregnancy test in your hands when Adam walked in. Harry had called him and he had said you would appreciate it if he popped over at home and have lunch with you or something for he was so busy with Gemma\u2019s wedding he couldn\u2019t escape to see you until later tonight. He wanted you to know he was okay with it, he wanted to train himself so he could be okay with it for real and Adam had come over to pick you up and had called for you around the house but when he couldn\u2019t find you he had made his way upstairs and had seen you, sitting on the bed and holding a pregnancy test. <i>Holy cow.\u00a0</i></p><p>He had promised not to tell Harry though. He had <i>strongly encouraged you </i>to tell him- to put it nicely- but you knew you could trust him and you knew he wouldn\u2019t tell him if you didn\u2019t want him to. He was your closest friend out of Harry\u2019s band\u00a0 but you knew your closeness with Adam was still a touchy subject for your boyfriend, it bothered him sometimes, so if it were to find out Adam out of all people knew about your pregnancy before he did, he would lose it, you were sure. You could get all arrogant again, and throw that speech at him that jealousy was just insecurities and that he had no fucking reason to be insecure because he was a Greek god, but then you would be being hypocritical because\u2026 Well because it had also bothered you sometimes how close he seemed to be with Ursula, his new hairstylist. It was stupid, but you couldn\u2019t help it when he was away and you were home and you thought about the two of them laughing in playful banter before the concerts.\u00a0</p><p>You decided you\u2019d throw the pregnancy test away before you and Adam left for lunch- last thing you needed was Harry finding it somewhere and freaking out. All throughout lunch, Adam couldn\u2019t stop smiling as he coaxed you into telling Harry because <i>he would be so happy, Y/N, damn it, that boy is so in love with you!\u00a0</i>\u00a0And after a lot of rolling your eyes and a lot of hitting his arm, you had decided to go grocery shopping so you could cook a nice dinner and tell Harry over a nice glass of wine.\u00a0</p><p>After a long day of walking around London with his mum and sister, he had come home in a rush to an empty house, expecting his hairstylist to knock on the door any minute now. He had called her over so they could talk about his sister\u2019s wedding, see if he could count on her to do her hair, and now they were making lemonade as they went over the dates and stuff. Ursula froze on the spot when, holding the remnants of the lemons on her hands, she saw the positive pregnancy test lying there on the bin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d She frowned. \u201cCongrats by the way.\u201d She raised her eyebrows, pursing her lips as she placed the lemonade in front of Harry.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d He smiled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOn the child!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat child?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She frowned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a positive pregnancy test on the bin.\u201d She whispered.\u00a0\u201cI thought you knew.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He stood up from the table, frowning in bewilderment before he made his way towards the bin. He bent over, grasping the test on his hand and staring at it with impossible thoughts burning on his mind. <i>You didn\u2019t tell him anything? You sure had been acting weird but.. He never thought\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you tell him? </i>He started thinking about all the little things you had said and all the little things you had done but he didn\u2019t see any hints on your part, or anything out of line really.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d Ursula noted.\u00a0<br></p><p>He looked up at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s not hers?\u201d She bit her bottom lip.\u00a0\u201cMaybe it\u2019s\u2026 a friend\u2019s of hers?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugged, unconvinced.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell it might not even be yours.\u201d She laughed and Harry frowned.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell if it\u2019s a friend\u2019s of hers is definitely not mine.\u201d He joked along and she shrugged.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou never know these days.\u201d She shrugged.\u00a0\u201cI mean with all the time we spend away\u2026 That\u2019d explain why she hasn\u2019t told you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Harry glared at her, his jaw clenched and his shoulders tensed as his fist curled around the positive test. He had a feeling it was yours, how unlikely was it anyway that a friend of yours would come to your place to take a fucking pregnancy test? And what friend anyway? Nancy was single and Eve was a lesbian. Of course they could get pregnant still but it was less likely than Y/N\u2026 Even though she took the pill, didn\u2019t she?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Y/N\u2019s then it\u2019s mine.\u201d He was sure of that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, man, relax.\u201d She chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI was just saying. I mean just\u2026 She hasn\u2019t told you, has she? That\u2019s weird. I mean I would tell you- I mean my boyfriend- even before I took the test, you know? I mean\u2026 Listen, H, I\u2019m just looking out for you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to look out for me when it comes about Y/N.\u201d It was clear he was mad.\u00a0\u201cWhat she and I have\u2026 You just don\u2019t get it if you think for one second she would cheat on me. Now, I don\u2019t want to be rude and gosh I know you didn\u2019t mean it but\u2026 I think you should leave. I didn\u2019t like the way you talked about my girlfriend.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry but if the kid doesn\u2019t look anything like you, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d She rolled her eyes before she left.\u00a0<br></p><p>She bumped your shoulder as she walked out the door and Harry rushed to keep the test on the cutlery drawer, cursing himself when he realized what he had done. You smiled at him before giving him a peck on the lips as you placed the bags on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGot you avocados.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened with Ursula by the way? I know you said she didn\u2019t hate me but she-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe had a fight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You had a fight?\u201d You frowned, thinking <i>he wouldn\u2019t fight if he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</i>\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUh, she\u2026 She said something she shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright?\u201d You frowned.\u00a0\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head.\u00a0\u201cShe was wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter. How was your day?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He kept the fruits and the yogurts on the fridge as you kept taking things out of the bags.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was good.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cHow was-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid you carry that bag all the way to the flat?\u201d He closed the fridge, resting his hand on the counter next to the bags and looking closely at your face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUh, yeah?\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a big girl, H.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be carrying that much weight.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You swallowed. You were surely just being paranoid. He couldn\u2019t know. Adam wouldn\u2019t have told him- he would have told you if he had. He was surely just saying that, just like he told you not to go to bed with your hair all wet or to eat <i>something else </i>when you had spent a week eating soup. His green eyes stared into your own before you turned around and started keeping things on the pantry.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Y/N?\u201d His figure followed you closely.\u00a0<br></p><p>You turned around and sighed, rubbing your forehead with your fingertips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that heavy-\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say to me?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><i>He knew. For the love of God, how could he know?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYes, I found your pink Gucci t-shirt. It was on the-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d He cut you short, his green eyes staring sternly into your own.\u00a0</p><p>You couldn\u2019t read his expression, but he didn\u2019t seem too thrilled about it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he told you.\u201d You snapped, covering your face with your hands.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d He frowned.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d You yelled.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me now, Harry, I really don\u2019t need you to-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d He frowned, raising his voice himself.\u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s fucking true! Is it Adam\u2019s? You\u2019re having Adam\u2019s baby?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You yelled.\u00a0\u201cHow dare you say something like that?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, right, I\u2019m not as stupid as you thought I was! You\u2026 Ursula was fucking right and here I was like a fucking idiot defending you!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat in the world are you saying? Do you seriously think I would cheat on you? Is that what you think of me, really?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow could I not?! You\u2019ve been acting so strange lately, all distant and fuck and then I found a fucking pregnancy test on the bin and\u2026 How long have you known for?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter? You really think I would cheat on you with your friend! I can\u2019t believe you think that of me, Harry. I thought you trusted me!\u201d You snapped.\u00a0\u201cAnd yet here you are, believing fucking Ursula over me? And it just had to be her, hadn\u2019t it? Just so you know Harry, I would never, ever cheat on you! You\u2019re everything I\u2019ve ever wanted and I love you, fuck,so knowing that\u2019s what you think of me fucking hurts, Harry! The baby is yours! Of course is yours you idiot!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecause I was scared! I am terrified! And maybe I\u2019m so scared because I don\u2019t know if I want to raise a baby with you!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>His frown deepened, his green eyes getting glossy as he tried to hold your gaze. Your jaw was clenched and you had never been madder in your entire life so you looked challenging, as if you didn\u2019t regret what you had said one bit. He didn\u2019t know what hurt him more, the words you had said or the fact that he had brought this upon himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d You got back at it\u00a0\u201cMaybe that is because I am not sure about a future with you!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNeither do I!\u201d You finished.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGoodbye then!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p>",
                "content": "<p><i>A/N: A little thing about Y/N not being ready to be a mom and Harry being clueless!&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess I&rsquo;ve just been feeling weird lately.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You rested your back against the old, almost vintage, white metal chair of your mother&rsquo;s garden. It was weird how in a matter of months, this place had changed from feeling like home to feeling like <i>your mother&rsquo;s house </i>for you had been living with Harry for six months now and that feeling of comfort and safety you used to feel when you walked through your mother&rsquo;s door was the one you felt now when you closed the door of your shared apartment in London.&nbsp;</p><p>You had kissed him goodbye the morning before you headed back home to visit your mum for a couple of days and now there she was, sitting down on her own chair, with her reading glasses on as she went through some of her patient&rsquo;s records. She stopped typing and turned her chair so she could have a good look at you though and you rolled your eyes playfully knowing the <i>visit </i>had just started.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by weird, hon?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She pursed her lips, the wrinkles around her eyes deepening as she narrowed her eyes the slightliest bit. She had managed to keep the garden as green as it was when you and your brother were still home and the fig tree was bearing the brunt of many figs that were just about ready to be picked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And sit down properly on your bottom, please.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Once again you rolled your eyes as a smirk tugged from your lips and you passed your legs over the armrest and sat down straight, just like Harry liked it as well <i>you&rsquo;re gonna hurt your back one of these days, m&rsquo;love.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; You shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean I got a cold a couple weeks ago when I went to the beach with Harry but I think it&rsquo;s been long enough for a cold to heal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It might be the flu, though.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that time of the year but&hellip; The flu&rsquo;s never out of the table.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>She stood up, wrapping her stethoscope around her neck before she stood right behind you grabbing your shoulders so she corrected your position. You couldn&rsquo;t stop smirking. She placed the stethoscope on your chest and asked you to take deep breaths.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Be careful though.&rdquo; You warned.&nbsp;&ldquo;My boobs hurt. I&rsquo;m waiting for my period.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Waiting?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I should get it this week.&rdquo; You nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Or maybe last week? I&rsquo;m not sure, I&rsquo;ve been super stressed with work and Gem&rsquo;s wedding so I haven&rsquo;t been properly keeping track.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t see your mum slowly nodding, as if she had just seen all the truth in the world, and she almost wanted to hit your head with the stethoscope because <i>dear Lord how could her own daughter be so clueless?&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re feeling tired?&rdquo; She asked, standing now next you so she could look into your eyes. You nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;And funny like sometimes you just wanna sleep and some other times you would eat everything in the fridge?&rdquo; You nodded again, opening your eyes wide because <i>man, that woman was a genius.&nbsp;</i>&ldquo;And&hellip; You haven&rsquo;t gotten your period this month.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You just looked at her, completely in shock at what you now knew she was going to say.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Then&hellip; I think it can only be two things.&rdquo; <i>So there&rsquo;s still hope, there&rsquo;s still hope&hellip;&nbsp;</i>&ldquo;A boy or a girl.&rdquo; She chuckled, placing the stethoscope on the table before she turned at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, baby, have you guys not been using protection?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, yeah, of course we do! I take the pill.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Every single day, no exception?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; You frowned, standing up so you looked more serious and honorable, you thought.&nbsp;&ldquo;I take the pill religiously. I mean I&rsquo;m 21 years old, madam, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to get pregnant and Harry&rsquo;s like super busy with his second album and&hellip; and&hellip; Already thinking about the second world tour and&hellip; I mean half his mates have daughters or sons so we know what that&rsquo;s like and I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I&rsquo;m not ready to be a mom.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You shook your head very fast and many times as if somehow you could get the pregnancy out of your mind if you moved your head enough. Your mum just smiled though and you hated that she wasn&rsquo;t freaking out like you so you frowned at her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why on Earth are you looking at me like that?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She just laughed so you crossed your arms across your chest, completely flabbergasted at your mum&rsquo;s reaction. How was this funny to her? Her only daughter might be pregnant at the age of 21 and all she could cook was like&hellip; pasta but like the easy type, with cheese or tomato sauce tops, or like&hellip; ready-made soup. You were in no shape to bring a baby into this world.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be allright, kid.&rdquo; She placed her warm hand over your shoulder though and you just stayed there, looking ahead at the fig tree, watching a fig falling to the ground.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Harry called you that same night, apologizing for having bein such a caveman about your friendship with Adam. It was really so silly, you thought, that he would get jealous of Adam. Yes, you were good friends but dear Lord he was a married man and he was so obviously in love with his wife, it was unbelievable that Harry would get jealous of him. You had talked it out the night before you came up to your mum&rsquo;s house, but really his jealousy had been the reason why you needed to come up to your hometown for a while, because lately everything was feeling weird for you. He asked about how you were feeling too, concern evident on his voice, but you didn&rsquo;t really cover the topic of your mum&rsquo;s suspicion or the conversation at all. You laughed way too loud at his terrible jokes and even he frowned at your reaction, smirking and asking why you were acting <i>so euphoric, baby; </i>but you didn&rsquo;t tell him anything because there was nothing to tell anyway. You hadn&rsquo;t even taken the pregnancy test and why worry him when there was no need, right? You didn&rsquo;t need to tell him just yet anyways&hellip; <i>How did it go? Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m having your baby, it&rsquo;s NONE of your bussiness, right?&nbsp;</i></p><p>You stayed with your mum for another day and even though you had rejected her many attempts of persuasiong for you to take the test, she had managed to calm you down about the whole possible pregnancy thing. She always did that- make things easier- and right then you thought if you were ever going to be a mum, at least you would have the best role model. As you drove back home, the indie playlist Harry had made for you filling your ears, you kept listening to your mum&rsquo;s words as if they were written somewhere in the car. <i>There are many options, love, and you can always decide not to be a mother just yet. Abortion is another valid choice, you know that, right? This is your life and no one has the right to judge you or act like they know better. You know Harry&rsquo;ll be there for you either way- otherwise your brother will kick his ass.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Yet Harry wasn&rsquo;t home when you got there and as much as you wanted to see him, you were also glad you could have a moment to yourself so you could at least think about the way of approaching this. Throwing your dirty clothes to the laundry basket, you frowned when you grabbed a small carton in your duffle bag. A pregnancy test- s<i>mooth, mum- </i>with a post-it note stick to it <i>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have an excuse not to tell him after you take the test, love.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>You rolled your eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>But you guessed she was right&hellip; So you closed the bathroom door, even though you were alone, and you took it., your hand shaking as you held it exactly where you needed it to be. You were going to tell him anyway. If it was positive, then you would ask him to sit down on the couch and you would tell him- somehow, that you were carrying his baby; and if it was negative then you would have a laugh about it over a salad- now that he was acting like a health freak again- later tonight.&nbsp;</p><p>Positive.&nbsp;</p><p>Positive.&nbsp;</p><p>Positive.&nbsp;</p><p>You looked at yourself in the mirror. Positive. You covered your belly with your hands. Positive. It was now flat but in a matter of months it would be all round and swollen and there will be a baby in there- well technically, there was already a baby in there, but it must be so tiny they didn&rsquo;t need any extra room just yet. And not just any baby but Harry&rsquo;s, Harry&rsquo;s baby was in your belly. You tried to swallow the lump in your throat as tears fell down your cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>You were only 21 years old. Looking at yourself in the mirror, for the first time you realized how much you still looked like a girl. You frowned. You imagined yourself sitting down on the living room floor trying to play with those small, colourful toys that babies had with a little boy, about 10 months old, with brown curly hair and green eyes. You imagined yourself feeding him in a high chair in the kitchen, taking him to the park, playing with him on the snow, swimming with him at the beach and then you imagined waking up in the middle of the night to a crying baby that wouldn&rsquo;t settle with anything.&nbsp;</p><p>You imagined Harry being gone, but he was just 24 years old, he was living his dream, having the time of his life and you were not about to ruin that for him with a boring family life, driving up to your mum&rsquo;s house to have lunch with her every second sunday. And yet you couldn&rsquo;t raise a child on your own either. Gosh, you didn&rsquo;t even know how to properly iron your clothes, how were you going to iron onesies? And alone at that? Was that what you wanted anyway? To have a family and be alone half the time? What would you do when your son missed his daddy?&nbsp;</p><p>You were holding the positive pregnancy test in your hands when Adam walked in. Harry had called him and he had said you would appreciate it if he popped over at home and have lunch with you or something for he was so busy with Gemma&rsquo;s wedding he couldn&rsquo;t escape to see you until later tonight. He wanted you to know he was okay with it, he wanted to train himself so he could be okay with it for real and Adam had come over to pick you up and had called for you around the house but when he couldn&rsquo;t find you he had made his way upstairs and had seen you, sitting on the bed and holding a pregnancy test. <i>Holy cow.&nbsp;</i></p><p>He had promised not to tell Harry though. He had <i>strongly encouraged you </i>to tell him- to put it nicely- but you knew you could trust him and you knew he wouldn&rsquo;t tell him if you didn&rsquo;t want him to. He was your closest friend out of Harry&rsquo;s band&nbsp; but you knew your closeness with Adam was still a touchy subject for your boyfriend, it bothered him sometimes, so if it were to find out Adam out of all people knew about your pregnancy before he did, he would lose it, you were sure. You could get all arrogant again, and throw that speech at him that jealousy was just insecurities and that he had no fucking reason to be insecure because he was a Greek god, but then you would be being hypocritical because&hellip; Well because it had also bothered you sometimes how close he seemed to be with Ursula, his new hairstylist. It was stupid, but you couldn&rsquo;t help it when he was away and you were home and you thought about the two of them laughing in playful banter before the concerts.&nbsp;</p><p>You decided you&rsquo;d throw the pregnancy test away before you and Adam left for lunch- last thing you needed was Harry finding it somewhere and freaking out. All throughout lunch, Adam couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling as he coaxed you into telling Harry because <i>he would be so happy, Y/N, damn it, that boy is so in love with you!&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;And after a lot of rolling your eyes and a lot of hitting his arm, you had decided to go grocery shopping so you could cook a nice dinner and tell Harry over a nice glass of wine.&nbsp;</p><p>After a long day of walking around London with his mum and sister, he had come home in a rush to an empty house, expecting his hairstylist to knock on the door any minute now. He had called her over so they could talk about his sister&rsquo;s wedding, see if he could count on her to do her hair, and now they were making lemonade as they went over the dates and stuff. Ursula froze on the spot when, holding the remnants of the lemons on her hands, she saw the positive pregnancy test lying there on the bin.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; She frowned. &ldquo;Congrats by the way.&rdquo; She raised her eyebrows, pursing her lips as she placed the lemonade in front of Harry.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo; He smiled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;On the child!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What child?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She frowned.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a positive pregnancy test on the bin.&rdquo; She whispered.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you knew.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He stood up from the table, frowning in bewilderment before he made his way towards the bin. He bent over, grasping the test on his hand and staring at it with impossible thoughts burning on his mind. <i>You didn&rsquo;t tell him anything? You sure had been acting weird but.. He never thought&hellip; Why didn&rsquo;t you tell him? </i>He started thinking about all the little things you had said and all the little things you had done but he didn&rsquo;t see any hints on your part, or anything out of line really.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo; Ursula noted.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He looked up at her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe&hellip; Maybe it&rsquo;s not hers?&rdquo; She bit her bottom lip.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s&hellip; a friend&rsquo;s of hers?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; He shrugged, unconvinced.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well it might not even be yours.&rdquo; She laughed and Harry frowned.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well if it&rsquo;s a friend&rsquo;s of hers is definitely not mine.&rdquo; He joked along and she shrugged.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You never know these days.&rdquo; She shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean with all the time we spend away&hellip; That&rsquo;d explain why she hasn&rsquo;t told you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Harry glared at her, his jaw clenched and his shoulders tensed as his fist curled around the positive test. He had a feeling it was yours, how unlikely was it anyway that a friend of yours would come to your place to take a fucking pregnancy test? And what friend anyway? Nancy was single and Eve was a lesbian. Of course they could get pregnant still but it was less likely than Y/N&hellip; Even though she took the pill, didn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Y/N&rsquo;s then it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; He was sure of that.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, man, relax.&rdquo; She chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was just saying. I mean just&hellip; She hasn&rsquo;t told you, has she? That&rsquo;s weird. I mean I would tell you- I mean my boyfriend- even before I took the test, you know? I mean&hellip; Listen, H, I&rsquo;m just looking out for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t need to look out for me when it comes about Y/N.&rdquo; It was clear he was mad.&nbsp;&ldquo;What she and I have&hellip; You just don&rsquo;t get it if you think for one second she would cheat on me. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to be rude and gosh I know you didn&rsquo;t mean it but&hellip; I think you should leave. I didn&rsquo;t like the way you talked about my girlfriend.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry but if the kid doesn&rsquo;t look anything like you, don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes before she left.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She bumped your shoulder as she walked out the door and Harry rushed to keep the test on the cutlery drawer, cursing himself when he realized what he had done. You smiled at him before giving him a peck on the lips as you placed the bags on the counter.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Got you avocados.&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened with Ursula by the way? I know you said she didn&rsquo;t hate me but she-&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We had a fight.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip; You had a fight?&rdquo; You frowned, thinking <i>he wouldn&rsquo;t fight if he didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp;</i>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, she&hellip; She said something she shouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright?&rdquo; You frowned.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;She was wrong, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. How was your day?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He kept the fruits and the yogurts on the fridge as you kept taking things out of the bags.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was good.&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;How was-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you carry that bag all the way to the flat?&rdquo; He closed the fridge, resting his hand on the counter next to the bags and looking closely at your face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah?&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big girl, H.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be carrying that much weight.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You swallowed. You were surely just being paranoid. He couldn&rsquo;t know. Adam wouldn&rsquo;t have told him- he would have told you if he had. He was surely just saying that, just like he told you not to go to bed with your hair all wet or to eat <i>something else </i>when you had spent a week eating soup. His green eyes stared into your own before you turned around and started keeping things on the pantry.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, Y/N?&rdquo; His figure followed you closely.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You turned around and sighed, rubbing your forehead with your fingertips.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t even that heavy-&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have anything to say to me?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>He knew. For the love of God, how could he know?&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I found your pink Gucci t-shirt. It was on the-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Baby.&rdquo; He cut you short, his green eyes staring sternly into your own.&nbsp;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t read his expression, but he didn&rsquo;t seem too thrilled about it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he told you.&rdquo; You snapped, covering your face with your hands.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; He frowned.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Adam!&rdquo; You yelled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play dumb with me now, Harry, I really don&rsquo;t need you to-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Adam?&rdquo; He frowned, raising his voice himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s fucking true! Is it Adam&rsquo;s? You&rsquo;re having Adam&rsquo;s baby?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You yelled.&nbsp;&ldquo;How dare you say something like that?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right, I&rsquo;m not as stupid as you thought I was! You&hellip; Ursula was fucking right and here I was like a fucking idiot defending you!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What in the world are you saying? Do you seriously think I would cheat on you? Is that what you think of me, really?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How could I not?! You&rsquo;ve been acting so strange lately, all distant and fuck and then I found a fucking pregnancy test on the bin and&hellip; How long have you known for?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why does it matter? You really think I would cheat on you with your friend! I can&rsquo;t believe you think that of me, Harry. I thought you trusted me!&rdquo; You snapped.&nbsp;&ldquo;And yet here you are, believing fucking Ursula over me? And it just had to be her, hadn&rsquo;t it? Just so you know Harry, I would never, ever cheat on you! You&rsquo;re everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted and I love you, fuck,so knowing that&rsquo;s what you think of me fucking hurts, Harry! The baby is yours! Of course is yours you idiot!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because I was scared! I am terrified! And maybe I&rsquo;m so scared because I don&rsquo;t know if I want to raise a baby with you!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>His frown deepened, his green eyes getting glossy as he tried to hold your gaze. Your jaw was clenched and you had never been madder in your entire life so you looked challenging, as if you didn&rsquo;t regret what you had said one bit. He didn&rsquo;t know what hurt him more, the words you had said or the fact that he had brought this upon himself.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And&hellip;&rdquo; You got back at it&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe that is because I am not sure about a future with you!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing here!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Neither do I!&rdquo; You finished.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye then!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>",
