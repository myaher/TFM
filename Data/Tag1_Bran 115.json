Analyzing the sequencing, we can conclude that after the first part of the battle outside the walls of Winterfell, the characters will retreat on the ramparts/battlements and the courtyard - meaning Jaime, Pod and Brienne survive the first wave. Jorah and Greyworm on the other hand, the show clearly leaves their fates in the balance. </p><p>And for other characters - Sansa, Bran, Dany - however, the secret is still not out as to where they can be and what they will be doing during the battle. Begs the question whether that&rsquo;s deliberately not shown because they are involved in important stuff of their own&hellip; Sansa may not be involved in the fighting itself but she will definitely have been participating in the strategy of defense. Tyrion maybe as well. And Bran and Dany have their role to play against the Night King&hellip; </p>",
