The journey was uneventful for the most part.  I am sure you must have heard about what happened to Sansa\u2019s direwolf.  I truly wish it didn\u2019t have to happen, but my mother is not one to let such things go easily. </i></p><p><i>I know my uncle, Tyrion, traveled north with you, saying something about seeing the edge of the world.  I understand he can be a bit trying at times, but he truly is a kind person.  Please be patient with him.  How is your new life in the Night\u2019s Watch?  Please write soon, it\u2019s awfully boring in King\u2019s Landing. </i></p><p><i>Signed,</i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jon thought for a moment, quill in hand as he stared at the piece of parchment before him.  He had to remember what he was taught.  He must use his manners, even if it felt like he was talking to an old friend. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To the crown princess (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>The Night\u2019s Watch wasn\u2019t what I was expecting.  In truth, your uncle was the only one to tell me what it really was.  The men here have no honor.  They hate me simply because I am better than them. </i></p><p><i>You uncle seems to be enjoying his stay.  He sits with the Lord Commander at dinners and is given plenty of furs to keep warm, though he is always saying how cold it is.  Are my sisters alright?  Arya has some trouble with being a lady, and I\u2019m worried about how she will fare in the South. </i></p><p><i>Signed,</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow</i></p><p>-</p><p><i>To Jon Snow,</i></p><p><i>Sansa has taken quite well to life in the south.  She acts almost as if she were born to be here.  Arya sometimes has trouble with her duties as a Lady, but she raves about her new dancing instructor.  She\u2019s asked me to tell you she is even more skilled with her needle than Sansa is with her own.  Hopefully, you can make more sense of that than I. </i></p><p><i>Please remember that, while it may not seem so, you grew up with far more luxury than many of the boys you are living with.  Perhaps try to help them, and they will begin to see things your way. </i></p><p><i>Your father is to have a tournament in his honor soon.  The entire city is talking about it.  My uncle, Jaime, is favored to win, but I\u2019ve heard whispers of a new knight named Ser Loras Tyrell.  What do you think will happen?</i></p><p><i>Signed, </i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p><i>P.S. I\u2019ve already told you, I\u2019m not very inclined to my title.  Please just call my (F/N). </i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jon smiled.  Of course you would yell at him.  He could just imagine you scoffing to yourself as your read his first sentence, rolling your eyes and reaching for your quill in defiance.  He frowned to himself.  He wanted to impress you somehow, but with what? </p><p>\u201cJon, hand me one of those pieces of parchment,\u201d Sam called.  Jon smiled.  That was perfect. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>You were right.  The men in here with had never even picked up a sword.  Once I started to help them learn a bit more, they started talking with me.  A new man has arrived just recently.  His name is Samwell Tarly.  A man named Rast was told to attack him, but I stopped it.  Ser Allister Thorne, the man training me, is very angry at me.  Rast wanted to keep hurting Sam, but we made things very clear with the help of Ghost.  No one will be attacking him any time soon.  That made Thorne even more angry, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll pass. </i></p><p><i>Please tell Arya that no matter what her dancing instructor told her, I\u2019m the one who taught her the first rule of how to use her Needle.  I have heard the rumors you speak of, but I doubt anyone could unhorse the Kingslayer in his own city.  Do tell me how the tournament went.  If I know my father, he\u2019s working himself too hard as the King\u2019s Hand.  If he is, please tell him to take a break.  How is your family?  Is Joffrey treating Sansa well?</i></p><p><i>Signed,</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow</i></p><p>-</p><p><i>To Jon,</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m so sorry.  You must know by now that my uncle has been taken prisoner by the Lady Stark.  She claims he had something to do with your poor brother\u2019s predicament.  When my uncle Jaime confronted your father with the news, Lord Stark took credit for everything.  My uncle was outraged, and they got into a fight.  One of the guards stabbed your father\u2019s leg with a spear and they left him there.  He is alive, and the Maester has hope, but he looks awful. </i></p><p><i>Please, if you hold any sway with Lady Stark, ask her to release my uncle.  Tyrion loves children, and he likes Bran.  I know he would never hurt him. </i></p><p><i>Yours truly,</i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jon inhaled sharply.  He had no doubt what you were saying was true, and he\u2019d met Tyrion before.  He wished he could help you, but Catelyn hated him with every fiber of her being.  She would never listen to what he had to say, whether it was true or not.  Still, he was determined to offer you some comfort. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry, but I hold no favor with Lady Catelyn.  She would never do something simply because I asked it of her, and I fear she might even react violently to any suggestion.  But fear not.  Lady Catelyn is rather vindictive, but she is not stupid.  She understands that killing Tyrion could be very dangerous for her family.</i></p><p><i>I have some good news, bad news, and disappointing news.  My uncle\u2019s horse arrived alone at the gates recently.  I\u2019m worried he might have died beyond the wall.  I am an official man of the Night\u2019s Watch now, but I\u2019ve been appointed the steward of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont.  Sam says he\u2019s grooming me, but I\u2019d still rather be a ranger, like my uncle.  Please give me some advice.  Your council is always comforting and wise. </i></p><p><i>Yours truly,</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow</i></p><p>-</p><p><i>To Jon Snow of the Night\u2019s Watch,</i></p><p><i>I regret to inform you that I am no longer to write to you.  Your father and half-brother are traitors to the crown and my beloved brother, King Joffrey Baratheon, first of his name.  Your sister has declared her loyalty to her betrothed, and is thus the only loyal Stark left.  Arya has <strike>escaped</strike> fled the Keep, your father has declared complete blasphemy, claiming my brother is not the true heir to the throne, and your brother now marches towards the capital.  I\u2019m sorry, Jon.

The journey was uneventful for the most part.  I am sure you must have heard about what happened to Sansa\u2019s direwolf.  I truly wish it didn\u2019t have to happen, but my mother is not one to let such things go easily. </i></p><p><i>I know my uncle, Tyrion, traveled north with you, saying something about seeing the edge of the world.  I understand he can be a bit trying at times, but he truly is a kind person.  Please be patient with him.  How is your new life in the Night\u2019s Watch?  Please write soon, it\u2019s awfully boring in King\u2019s Landing. </i></p><p><i>Signed,</i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jon thought for a moment, quill in hand as he stared at the piece of parchment before him.  He had to remember what he was taught.  He must use his manners, even if it felt like he was talking to an old friend. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To the crown princess (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>The Night\u2019s Watch wasn\u2019t what I was expecting.  In truth, your uncle was the only one to tell me what it really was.  The men here have no honor.  They hate me simply because I am better than them. </i></p><p><i>You uncle seems to be enjoying his stay.  He sits with the Lord Commander at dinners and is given plenty of furs to keep warm, though he is always saying how cold it is.  Are my sisters alright?  Arya has some trouble with being a lady, and I\u2019m worried about how she will fare in the South. </i></p><p><i>Signed,</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow</i></p><p>-</p><p><i>To Jon Snow,</i></p><p><i>Sansa has taken quite well to life in the south.  She acts almost as if she were born to be here.  Arya sometimes has trouble with her duties as a Lady, but she raves about her new dancing instructor.  She\u2019s asked me to tell you she is even more skilled with her needle than Sansa is with her own.  Hopefully, you can make more sense of that than I. </i></p><p><i>Please remember that, while it may not seem so, you grew up with far more luxury than many of the boys you are living with.  Perhaps try to help them, and they will begin to see things your way. </i></p><p><i>Your father is to have a tournament in his honor soon.  The entire city is talking about it.  My uncle, Jaime, is favored to win, but I\u2019ve heard whispers of a new knight named Ser Loras Tyrell.  What do you think will happen?</i></p><p><i>Signed, </i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p><i>P.S. I\u2019ve already told you, I\u2019m not very inclined to my title.  Please just call my (F/N). </i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jon smiled.  Of course you would yell at him.  He could just imagine you scoffing to yourself as your read his first sentence, rolling your eyes and reaching for your quill in defiance.  He frowned to himself.  He wanted to impress you somehow, but with what? </p><p>\u201cJon, hand me one of those pieces of parchment,\u201d Sam called.  Jon smiled.  That was perfect. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>You were right.  The men in here with had never even picked up a sword.  Once I started to help them learn a bit more, they started talking with me.  A new man has arrived just recently.  His name is Samwell Tarly.  A man named Rast was told to attack him, but I stopped it.  Ser Allister Thorne, the man training me, is very angry at me.  Rast wanted to keep hurting Sam, but we made things very clear with the help of Ghost.  No one will be attacking him any time soon.  That made Thorne even more angry, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll pass. </i></p><p><i>Please tell Arya that no matter what her dancing instructor told her, I\u2019m the one who taught her the first rule of how to use her Needle.  I have heard the rumors you speak of, but I doubt anyone could unhorse the Kingslayer in his own city.  Do tell me how the tournament went.  If I know my father, he\u2019s working himself too hard as the King\u2019s Hand.  If he is, please tell him to take a break.  How is your family?  Is Joffrey treating Sansa well?</i></p><p><i>Signed,</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow</i></p><p>-</p><p><i>To Jon,</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m so sorry.  You must know by now that my uncle has been taken prisoner by the Lady Stark.  She claims he had something to do with your poor brother\u2019s predicament.  When my uncle Jaime confronted your father with the news, Lord Stark took credit for everything.  My uncle was outraged, and they got into a fight.  One of the guards stabbed your father\u2019s leg with a spear and they left him there.  He is alive, and the Maester has hope, but he looks awful. </i></p><p><i>Please, if you hold any sway with Lady Stark, ask her to release my uncle.  Tyrion loves children, and he likes Bran.  I know he would never hurt him. </i></p><p><i>Yours truly,</i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jon inhaled sharply.  He had no doubt what you were saying was true, and he\u2019d met Tyrion before.  He wished he could help you, but Catelyn hated him with every fiber of her being.  She would never listen to what he had to say, whether it was true or not.  Still, he was determined to offer you some comfort. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry, but I hold no favor with Lady Catelyn.  She would never do something simply because I asked it of her, and I fear she might even react violently to any suggestion.  But fear not.  Lady Catelyn is rather vindictive, but she is not stupid.  She understands that killing Tyrion could be very dangerous for her family.</i></p><p><i>I have some good news, bad news, and disappointing news.  My uncle\u2019s horse arrived alone at the gates recently.  I\u2019m worried he might have died beyond the wall.  I am an official man of the Night\u2019s Watch now, but I\u2019ve been appointed the steward of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont.  Sam says he\u2019s grooming me, but I\u2019d still rather be a ranger, like my uncle.  Please give me some advice.  Your council is always comforting and wise. </i></p><p><i>Yours truly,</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow</i></p><p>-</p><p><i>To Jon Snow of the Night\u2019s Watch,</i></p><p><i>I regret to inform you that I am no longer to write to you.  Your father and half-brother are traitors to the crown and my beloved brother, King Joffrey Baratheon, first of his name.  Your sister has declared her loyalty to her betrothed, and is thus the only loyal Stark left.  Arya has <strike>escaped</strike> fled the Keep, your father has declared complete blasphemy, claiming my brother is not the true heir to the throne, and your brother now marches towards the capital.

That was perfect. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>You were right.  The men in here with had never even picked up a sword.  Once I started to help them learn a bit more, they started talking with me.  A new man has arrived just recently.  His name is Samwell Tarly.  A man named Rast was told to attack him, but I stopped it.  Ser Allister Thorne, the man training me, is very angry at me.  Rast wanted to keep hurting Sam, but we made things very clear with the help of Ghost.  No one will be attacking him any time soon.  That made Thorne even more angry, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll pass. </i></p><p><i>Please tell Arya that no matter what her dancing instructor told her, I\u2019m the one who taught her the first rule of how to use her Needle.  I have heard the rumors you speak of, but I doubt anyone could unhorse the Kingslayer in his own city.  Do tell me how the tournament went.  If I know my father, he\u2019s working himself too hard as the King\u2019s Hand.  If he is, please tell him to take a break.  How is your family?  Is Joffrey treating Sansa well?</i></p><p><i>Signed,</i></p><p><i>Jon Snow</i></p><p>-</p><p><i>To Jon,</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m so sorry.  You must know by now that my uncle has been taken prisoner by the Lady Stark.  She claims he had something to do with your poor brother\u2019s predicament.  When my uncle Jaime confronted your father with the news, Lord Stark took credit for everything.  My uncle was outraged, and they got into a fight.  One of the guards stabbed your father\u2019s leg with a spear and they left him there.  He is alive, and the Maester has hope, but he looks awful. </i></p><p><i>Please, if you hold any sway with Lady Stark, ask her to release my uncle.  Tyrion loves children, and he likes Bran.  I know he would never hurt him. </i></p><p><i>Yours truly,</i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jon inhaled sharply.  He had no doubt what you were saying was true, and he\u2019d met Tyrion before.  He wished he could help you, but Catelyn hated him with every fiber of her being.  She would never listen to what he had to say, whether it was true or not.  Still, he was determined to offer you some comfort. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>To (Y/N) Baratheon,</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry, but I hold no favor with Lady Catelyn.  She would never do something simply because I asked it of her, and I fear she might even react violently to any suggestion.  But fear not.  Lady Catelyn is rather vindictive, but she is not stupid.  She understands that killing Tyrion could be very dangerous for her family.</i></p><p><i>I have some good news, bad news, and disappointing news.

I am an official man of the Night\u2019s Watch now, but I\u2019ve been appointed the steward of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont.

It didn\u2019t sound like you.  It sounded too forced.  You\u2019d never used your title before. </p><p>He knew he should be concerned with the content of the letter.  The thought of his father in the dungeons and his brother marching on the south terrified him, but the idea that you might be in trouble almost made him sick to his stomach. </p><p>Quickly he\u2019d made up his mind.  He saddled his horse and fled Castle Black.  He didn\u2019t get very far before Sam, Pip, and Grenn stopped him. </p><p>\u201cJon, you can\u2019t leave.  You\u2019ll be killed as a deserter!\u201d Sam said. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my family, Sam,\u201d Jon lied.  He knew in his heart that he was riding to King\u2019s Landing.

He started to move again. </p><p>\u201cNight gathers, and so my watch begins!\u201d Pip moved forward to cut him off again.  \u201cIt shall not end until my death.

I pledge my life and honor to the Night\u2019s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.\u201d</p><p>Jon grit his teeth together.  He knew what you would say.  You\u2019d say he made a commitment and he had to honor it.  Sam handed him Longclaw, meeting his eyes and almost begging him not to go.  Jon nodded slightly and went with his brothers back to Castle Black. </p><p>(Suuuuuper long time skip)</p><p>Years passed, and it never got any easier for Jon.  Thoughts of you plagued him day and night.  He\u2019d received letters speaking of your betrayal of the royal family.  According to Cersei\u2019s propaganda, you helped to aid the fugitive, Sansa, after she killed your brother.  It was a slight comfort to him that you were with his sister, but he would still rather have you here, in his arms. </p><p>Then the letter arrived. </p><p>-</p><p><i>Dearest Jon,</i></p><p><i>It has been far too long since we last exchanged letters, and for that I am truly sorry.

I do not trust the man she is with any more than I would trust a lion.  Now she is to marry Ramsay Bolton, the bastard who was newly made a lord.  I\u2019ve heard rumors of Ramsay\u2019s cruelty, and the fact that his father betrayed his honor and your family makes me even more wary of him.  What I\u2019m asking, Jon, is to know that, should we need it, we could be safe in Castle Black.  I know I have no right to ask such things after all this time, but I need your help, now more than ever. </i></p><p><i>Forever yours,</i></p><p><i>(Y/N) Baratheon</i></p><p>\u2014</p><p>Before he\u2019d even had a chance to think, Jon had already picked up a Quill and piece of parchment. </p><p>\u2014</p><p><i>Dear (Y/N),</i></p><p><i>You are always welcome in Castle Black, as well as my sister.

He was finally free to tell you how he felt.  If only you were here. </p><p>There was a commotion down in the square, men murmuring amongst themselves.  Jon looked down to meet your eyes.  You had grown a lot.  You\u2019d been beaten and worn and thrown around like you were nothing.  Yet still, you had a fire in your eyes. </p><p>You were just as he pictured those many nights standing guard on the Wall.  Your beautiful (H/C) hair cascading down in waves, those same pools of (E/C) gazing into his very core.  Tears clouded your eyes, and Jon couldn\u2019t take it anymore.  He ran down into the middle of the square, taking you into his arms in a warm embrace.  You were dirty and sweaty and a bit bloody, but he couldn\u2019t imagine letting you go. </p><p>After a very long embrace, the two of you parted.  Jon held your face gently in his hands, studying every detail like it was the last he\u2019d ever see you. </p><p>\u201cLord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, eh?\u201d You smiled weakly.  \u201cYou\u2019ve done quite well for yourself, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head.  \u201cI no longer have any obligations or ties to the Night\u2019s Watch.  I\u2019ve done my duty, and I\u2019m free to leave.\u201d</p><p>You were silent a moment, staring into his eyes in shock.  Finally, you uttered three words.  \u201cThank the gods.\u201d  You crashed your lips into his in what must have been the most passionate kiss in history.  Everything the two of you had been through went into that kiss, from the moment you met, to when you lost all hope of seeing one another again, to finally reuniting after years apart.  You loved each other, more than anything else in the world, and through this kiss, you both knew it.  Jon made up his mind the second your lips touched.  He would never leave you again, for this night and all the nights to come.</p></p>",

A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said. Maester Luwin laughed. A maester forges his chain with study, he told me. The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn&rsquo;t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can&rsquo;t make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like.<b> A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people</b>.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><b>Maester Aemon smiled. &ldquo;And so?&rdquo;</b></i><br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Night&rsquo;s Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn&rsquo;t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won&rsquo;t either. <b>You can&rsquo;t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean tin is useless. Why shouldn&rsquo;t Sam be a steward?</b>&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>This just makes this scene 10000x better, knowing that Jon Snow is the type of friend a younger Maester Aemon probably <i>needed </i>makes their relationship in old age so much more meaningful:</p><blockquote><p><i><b>&ldquo;I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Maester Aemon prompted.</i></p><p><i>Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry. &ldquo;He could help you,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write. I know Chett can&rsquo;t read, and Clydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book in his father&rsquo;s library. He&rsquo;d be good with the ravens too. Animals seem to like him. Ghost took to him straight off. <b>There&rsquo;s a lot he could do, besides fighting. The Night&rsquo;s Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead.</b>&rdquo;<br/></i></p><p><i><b>Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep. Finally he said, &ldquo;Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem.&rdquo;</b></i><br/></p></blockquote><p>I. AM. SO. EMO. I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY MAESTER AEMON WAS SO TOUCHED AT JON\u2019S WORDS!<i> It felt persona</i>l, and Jon was wiser than most at such a young age.\u00a0</p><p>Yes, he had a lot to learn, and yes there is a problematic class privilege in the Night\u2019s Watch, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Sam does have it in him to be a steward, and Jon saw that potential when no one else did. It delves beautifully into Aemon supporting him when everyone else calls him a turncloak, and even better when he is Lord Commander and Aemon gives him the same advice he gave his brother:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>And, forgive me if I\u2019m wrong, might just be a nod to Jon himself, if his given name by Lyanna is truly Aegon. One of my favorite relationships of two men who didn\u2019t know were secretly related, and still grew to admire and care for one another.</p>",
