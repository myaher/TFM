When you reached the living room you were met with Thor and Steve doing an arm wrestling match and the rest of the team screaming out Steve and Thor\u2019s name You stopped and looked at the gang, your face contorted into confusion.</p><p>Steve had noticed another presence in the room and glanced up to see your face. Immediately after he saw you, his level of concentration on the match decreased and Thor\u2019s arm power overtook Steve\u2019s causing Thor to jump up and celebrate his\u00a0\u201cvictory\u201d. Natasha, Bruce, Sam, Clint and Bucky all gave out a groan and handed fifty dollars to Tony, Peter and Vision. Steve noticed this and gave Thor a pat on the shoulder and muttered a\u00a0\u201cwell done\u201d. You giggled at Thor\u2019s dance moves and that\u2019s when the rest of the gang noticed your presence.</p><p>\u201cY/N! You have arrived at the right time! We were just about to commence round two of the arm wrestling match, place your bet on either one of these guys!\u201d Tony offered, sliding an arm around your shoulders. You chuckled at his behaviour.\u00a0\u201cUm, no thanks Tony, I just came by to say\u00a0\u201chey\u201d.\u201d You replied, rejecting the offer.\u00a0\u201cOh and to drop in some of my special desserts that I need approval on.\u201d You held up a bag that contained the desserts. Everyone cheered at the sound of your desserts.\u00a0</p><p>Steve hadn&rsquo;t said a word since you came in but as soon as you left the building, boy oh boy, did he have some things on his mind. He sat down on the sofa and began thinking about you. Nat had noticed this and began to pester him about it as soon as the gang had left the room to enjoy some of the treats that Y/N had left.\u00a0\u201cSteve, I know that you have a crush on Y/N, just ask her out.\u201d Steve sighed at this.\u00a0\u201cYou know I\u2019d love to, but I just want it to be perfect for her.\u201d Nat chuckled at this.\u00a0\u201cOkay, well I would take her out to a fancy restaurant and then maybe to go see an old movie outdoors.\u201d She suggested. Steve thanked her for this and decided to venture off to ask Tony for advice.\u00a0</p><p>Tony and Bruce were down in the lab working on something that Steve couldn&rsquo;t understand. The pair noticed this and both shared a look.\u00a0\u201cTony, Bruce, I need some help.\u201d Tony wiped his hands on a rag he had found and walked over to Steve.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s on the mind of our ninety year old virgin?\u201d Tony asked. Steve sighed at the sound of the nickname.\u00a0\u201cTony, you know I hate that name, but I need some suggestions on a first date.\u201d Tony and Bruce\u2019s eyes both widened at the sound of this.\u00a0\u201cOkay buddy, I\u2019m out!\u201d Bruce turned back to his work. Tony on the other hand was not done yet.\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s the lucky girl?\u201d Tony nudged. \u201cY/N, look that doesn&rsquo;t matter.\u201d Tony chuckled.\u00a0\u201cWell, I would go to great lengths to make her happy. Take her to a fancy dinner, oh, I can host a party.\u201d Steve untangled himself from Tony and ran out of the room.\u00a0</p><p>The rest of the day was spent asking his friends on advice but all to no avail. Steve sulked up to his room and thought about the 1940\u2032s, eventually falling asleep to the thought of it. The following day, Steve went out to set up what he considered a brilliant first date.\u00a0</p><p>You had spent the day lounging on your sofa, bored out of your mind. That was until you heard a knock on your door. You knew that nobody was coming to visit you. You rolled off the sofa and hit the ground with a thud. You carried yourself off of the ground and walked to the front door. You found that nobody was there but when you looked down you found a box and a small card on top of it. You looked around and picked up the box. You sat it down on the coffee table and opened the box. You found a knee length, rose gold dress and a pair of blush pink heels. You were slightly confused. You opened the card and read its contents. It read:\u00a0</p><p><i>My Dearest Y/N,</i></p><p><i>You are most likely reading this to understand the reason behind the box filled with a lovely dress and shoes. Well it\u2019s because I have a special surprise for you. Meet me at Mason\u2019s roof at seven thirty. I hope to see you there.</i></p><p><i>Love from,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Your secret admirer</i></p><p>You frowned at the secret admirer bit, but looked at the clock on your wall. 5:30 p.m. Better start getting ready then. You shaved your legs and armpits, took a quick shower, got dressed and did your makeup, and did your hair (whatever style of hair you have). You opened up your jewellery box and found one of the necklaces that Steve had given to you on your birthday. You put that on with a pair of golden hoops. You grabbed the perfume bottle and sprayed yourself excessively. You checked the time once again and saw that it was 6:30. You had thirty minutes to get to Mason\u2019s. You walked down the beautiful lit up street to Mason\u2019s restaurant. The waiter noticed you and walked you up the back stairs to the roof.\u00a0</p><p>You saw that the roof was decorated with fairy lights and candles in little jars. You smiled at that. The figure that stood before you had their back turned to you and you were really confused. You took one step forward. The figure turned around to reveal a smartly dressed Steve. You both gasped.\u00a0\u201cHello Y/N, you look amazing.\u201d He breathed. You smiled.\u00a0\u201cSecret admirer?\u201d He chuckled, nodding his head.\u00a0\u201cDinner?\u201d He asked. You nodded your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d You joked.\u00a0</p><p>He helped you sit down. The waiter from before came and brought up one of your favourite dishes. At this point your mouth was watering, you dug into your dinner. Once you had finished your meal, Steve stood up and turned on the radio.\u00a0\u201cDancing in The Moonlight\u201d was the song that played.\u00a0\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d He asked, holding out his hand. You obliged and began to dance slowly to the music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know, I love you so much, Y/N.\u201d You smiled at him.\u00a0\u201cI knew that.\u201d You said, ruining the moment. Steve frowned.\u00a0\u201cBut I love you too.\u201d You said, looking up at him. You were still a little shorter than Steve in heels, so you went up on your tippy toes to reach his lips. He kissed back and held you tight. Then you heard a loud cheer. You and Steve broke the kiss and you look around to see the Avengers on the next roof with a camera. You and Steve both laughed but gave them what they wanted.</p><p>A relationship.<br/></p>",

Take her to a fancy dinner, oh, I can host a party.\u201d Steve untangled himself from Tony and ran out of the room.\u00a0</p><p>The rest of the day was spent asking his friends on advice but all to no avail. Steve sulked up to his room and thought about the 1940\u2032s, eventually falling asleep to the thought of it. The following day, Steve went out to set up what he considered a brilliant first date.\u00a0</p><p>You had spent the day lounging on your sofa, bored out of your mind. That was until you heard a knock on your door. You knew that nobody was coming to visit you. You rolled off the sofa and hit the ground with a thud. You carried yourself off of the ground and walked to the front door. You found that nobody was there but when you looked down you found a box and a small card on top of it. You looked around and picked up the box. You sat it down on the coffee table and opened the box. You found a knee length, rose gold dress and a pair of blush pink heels. You were slightly confused. You opened the card and read its contents. It read:\u00a0</p><p><i>My Dearest Y/N,</i></p><p><i>You are most likely reading this to understand the reason behind the box filled with a lovely dress and shoes. Well it\u2019s because I have a special surprise for you. Meet me at Mason\u2019s roof at seven thirty. I hope to see you there.</i></p><p><i>Love from,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Your secret admirer</i></p><p>You frowned at the secret admirer bit, but looked at the clock on your wall. 5:30 p.m. Better start getting ready then. You shaved your legs and armpits, took a quick shower, got dressed and did your makeup, and did your hair (whatever style of hair you have). You opened up your jewellery box and found one of the necklaces that Steve had given to you on your birthday. You put that on with a pair of golden hoops. You grabbed the perfume bottle and sprayed yourself excessively. You checked the time once again and saw that it was 6:30. You had thirty minutes to get to Mason\u2019s. You walked down the beautiful lit up street to Mason\u2019s restaurant. The waiter noticed you and walked you up the back stairs to the roof.\u00a0</p><p>You saw that the roof was decorated with fairy lights and candles in little jars. You smiled at that. The figure that stood before you had their back turned to you and you were really confused. You took one step forward. The figure turned around to reveal a smartly dressed Steve. You both gasped.\u00a0\u201cHello Y/N, you look amazing.\u201d He breathed. You smiled.\u00a0\u201cSecret admirer?\u201d He chuckled, nodding his head.\u00a0\u201cDinner?\u201d He asked. You nodded your head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d You joked.\u00a0</p><p>He helped you sit down. The waiter from before came and brought up one of your favourite dishes. At this point your mouth was watering, you dug into your dinner. Once you had finished your meal, Steve stood up and turned on the radio.\u00a0\u201cDancing in The Moonlight\u201d was the song that played.\u00a0\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d He asked, holding out his hand. You obliged and began to dance slowly to the music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know, I love you so much, Y/N.\u201d You smiled at him.\u00a0\u201cI knew that.\u201d You said, ruining the moment. Steve frowned.\u00a0\u201cBut I love you too.\u201d You said, looking up at him. You were still a little shorter than Steve in heels, so you went up on your tippy toes to reach his lips. He kissed back and held you tight. Then you heard a loud cheer. You and Steve broke the kiss and you look around to see the Avengers on the next roof with a camera. You and Steve both laughed but gave them what they wanted.</p><p>A relationship.<br></p>",

When you reached the living room you were met with Thor and Steve doing an arm wrestling match and the rest of the team screaming out Steve and Thor\u2019s name You stopped and looked at the gang, your face contorted into confusion.</p><p>Steve had noticed another presence in the room and glanced up to see your face. Immediately after he saw you, his level of concentration on the match decreased and Thor\u2019s arm power overtook Steve\u2019s causing Thor to jump up and celebrate his\u00a0\u201cvictory\u201d. Natasha, Bruce, Sam, Clint and Bucky all gave out a groan and handed fifty dollars to Tony, Peter and Vision. Steve noticed this and gave Thor a pat on the shoulder and muttered a\u00a0\u201cwell done\u201d. You giggled at Thor\u2019s dance moves and that\u2019s when the rest of the gang noticed your presence.</p><p>\u201cY/N! You have arrived at the right time! We were just about to commence round two of the arm wrestling match, place your bet on either one of these guys!\u201d Tony offered, sliding an arm around your shoulders. You chuckled at his behaviour.\u00a0\u201cUm, no thanks Tony, I just came by to say\u00a0\u201chey\u201d.\u201d You replied, rejecting the offer.\u00a0\u201cOh and to drop in some of my special desserts that I need approval on.\u201d You held up a bag that contained the desserts. Everyone cheered at the sound of your desserts.\u00a0</p><p>Steve hadn\u2019t said a word since you came in but as soon as you left the building, boy oh boy, did he have some things on his mind. He sat down on the sofa and began thinking about you.

Steve thanked her for this and decided to venture off to ask Tony for advice.\u00a0</p><p>Tony and Bruce were down in the lab working on something that Steve couldn\u2019t understand. The pair noticed this and both shared a look.\u00a0\u201cTony, Bruce, I need some help.\u201d Tony wiped his hands on a rag he had found and walked over to Steve.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s on the mind of our ninety year old virgin?\u201d Tony asked.

As a matter of fact, I think he has very nearly succeeded in the past, only to be stopped by Odin, and presumably, Hela. My evidence? This lovely little bit from Thor: Ragnarok:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"719\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/de4a4438041776341a4709975bd78cc7/tumblr_pc1sqpz8HI1vf95a1_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"719\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Now, this clip poses us at the very least three questions.</p><ol><li>How (and why) is there a model of the Infinity Gauntlet in Odin\u2019s vault?</li><li>How (and why) would Hela know it\u2019s fake?</li><li>Why is said Infinity Gauntlet an exact replica in all means of size and detail as the one seen being worn and used by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War?</li></ol><p>The solution that best answers all of these questions is that Thanos has in fact tried this whole exact scheme of harnessing the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the population of the universe. As a matter of fact, I think the idea is more that possible. </p><p>In most continuities of comics, if he isn\u2019t in fact immortal, Thanos is very, VERY old. So, even despite the massive differences between comic  Thanos and MCU Thanos, it would at least make sense for MCU Thanos to be ancient as well. Perhaps even as old as Odin. So there\u2019s one thing.</p><p>Second, we know that Thanos seems to be exceptionally good at tracking and collecting Infinity Stones. Heck he has the mind stone in his hands right from he get go. It might make sense that he got this good at it from experience. Nearly bringing them all together once before. Before having them slipped from his grasp and once again spread across the galaxy. Or at least he\u2019s good at doing so when he\u2019s doing it himself, and not hiding behind proxies like Loki and Ronan. Speaking of which&hellip;</p><p>Why would someone as massively capable as Thanos the Mad Titan, feared and dreaded by all, be hiding behind puppets? Because he\u2019s lazy? No, can\u2019t be that. This guy\u2019s spent some ungodly amount of indeterminate time doing nothing but planet hopping and personally murdering half the populations of each. So obviously, the guy\u2019s not the throne potatoe we all like to joke about. </p><p>So, maybe he just believed that all this hands on slaughter was more important? No, he\u2019s all too willing to bring an end to the practice to pursue the Infinity Stones once Ronan fails, and he seems to be of the mind set that the quickest, least painful way of culling the universe is the best way. So that really wouldn\u2019t make sense. </p><p>That leaves us with a third option, and one I think very likely. He doesn\u2019t want to draw attention to himself. But attention from who might you ask? </p><p>The Nova Corps? Obviously not. He annihilated them easily without even a single Infinity Stone. </p><p>The Eternals? Not them either. He walked right up to The Collector and merc\u2019d the hell out of him. </p><p>What about Celestials, like Ego? Clearly not. Hell, Ego had been planning to wipe out all life anyway, so what\u2019s he care if some purple ego maniac does half the work for him? </p><p>That leaves us with only one real presence in the universe to be hiding from. Asgard. The same folks who just so happen to have an exact replica of his handy dandy Infinify Gauntlet locked up in Odin\u2019s vault of super deadly weapons collected from his enemies that should never ever under any circumstances ever be tampered with.</p><p>So now that we\u2019ve funneled it down to this, I have one final bit of evidence. The timing of Thanos\u2019s Infinity War. His sudden, massively quick run in which he collects all the Infinity Stones, and finally cuts the universe in two, all within the cours of about a day and a half. If he could do it so quickly, why not do it before? As we mentioned he was probably trying not to draw the attention of Asgard, or in our case now, Asgard\u2019s former leaders, Odin and Hela. </p><p>Over the course of Thor: Ragnarok Odin passes away (presumably of natural causes), Hela escapes Hel and breifly takes over Asgard,  until both she and Asgard are destroyed by Surtur and the triggering of the Ragnarock. Each of these events correlate with a big move by Thanos. I think it\u2019s very interesting that Thanos innitiates this almost blitzkrieg like plan only after Odin has died. </p><p>So putting this all together we come to the following theory:</p><p>Some time in the far, far past, Thanos began to collect the Infinity Stones, either collecting them all, or collecting nearly all of them, perhaps save the Soul Stone. He nearly achieves his goal, but seeing the danger posed to all the universe, Asgard rises up against him, led by Odin and Hela. Thanos is defeated, and during the battle the original gauntlet is destroyed (hence how Hela knows the gauntlet in the vault is a fake.) and the stones are once again spread across the cosmos, presumably to forever be kept out of the Mad Titan\u2019s reach. Thanos retreats to deep space. Perhaps these events even trigger the change in Odin\u2019s heart that Hela complains about. Over the course of the next several thousand years, Thanos slowly but surely becomes aware of the locations of the Infinity Stones, save the Soul Stone. First, he finds and takes the Mind Stone, which he later puts in the scepter that he bestowed upon Loki. He\u2019s also probably been well aware of the wareabout of the Space and Reality Stones for this time as well, given their frequent usage as the Tesseract and the Aether. Second, he moves to retake the Space Stone, arming Loki with an army and sending him to Earth to collect it. Note, all this begins once Odin\u2019s health begins to decline in Thor 1. This of course fails, as the Avengers, Tony Stark in particular, thwart Loki and through him Thanos\u2019s plans. He loses both the Space and Mind Stones. Third, he moves to collect the Power Stone, using his puppet Ronan. This is also met with failure as Ronan betrays him and he himself is subsequently defeated by the Gaurdians of the Galaxy who leave the Power Stone with the Nova Corps on Zandar. Thanos has now lost the Power Stone as well, and by this point he is beginning to become pretty seriously peeved. Proclaiming to literally no one but the audience:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"239\" data-orig-width=\"498\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b56199ec86d4667ac62e6795d247c64f/tumblr_pc1vd93U3f1vf95a1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"239\" data-orig-width=\"498\"/></figure><p>However, despite all this talk of \u201cdoing it himself\u201d, he still does not act, aside from the obvious attack on Nidavellir that must have taken place by this point. Then finally one day, Odin finally decides he\u2019s had enough of both his sons\u2019 and the world\u2019s bullshit, and peaces out in Norway. Now  presumably word reaches Thanos of this, and immediately goes about doing it himself. He heads to Zandar, where he destroys the Nova Corps, and collects the Power Stone. Then, in a move to take out both his biggest threat and collect the Space Stone, he heads for Asgard. However, by the time Sanctuary 2 gets there, Asgard has already been destroyed by Sutur, who\u2019se practically just done Thanos\u2019s work for him and this point. So all he has to do is attack the refugee ship and collect the Stone from Loki, whom Thanos knows covets it and would of course save it from the firey destruction of Ragnarok. Which brings us to the opening scene of Infinity War, and the first in a very long line of very upsetting character deaths.</p><p>Anyway, that\u2019s my theory. I know it\u2019s long, clunky, and disorganized so I thank you if you actually read the whole thing. Hope you enjoyed it. Bye!</p>",

Thanos is defeated, and during the battle the original gauntlet is destroyed (hence how Hela knows the gauntlet in the vault is a fake.) and the stones are once again spread across the cosmos, presumably to forever be kept out of the Mad Titan\u2019s reach. Thanos retreats to deep space. Perhaps these events even trigger the change in Odin\u2019s heart that Hela complains about. Over the course of the next several thousand years, Thanos slowly but surely becomes aware of the locations of the Infinity Stones, save the Soul Stone.

He\u2019s also probably been well aware of the wareabout of the Space and Reality Stones for this time as well, given their frequent usage as the Tesseract and the Aether. Second, he moves to retake the Space Stone, arming Loki with an army and sending him to Earth to collect it. Note, all this begins once Odin\u2019s health begins to decline in Thor 1. This of course fails, as the Avengers, Tony Stark in particular, thwart Loki and through him Thanos\u2019s plans. He loses both the Space and Mind Stones. Third, he moves to collect the Power Stone, using his puppet Ronan. This is also met with failure as Ronan betrays him and he himself is subsequently defeated by the Gaurdians of the Galaxy who leave the Power Stone with the Nova Corps on Zandar. Thanos has now lost the Power Stone as well, and by this point he is beginning to become pretty seriously peeved.

                "content": "<p><h1>So, I have a Thanos Theory</h1><p>Or more specifically, a theory about Thanos and the Infinity Stones. I don&rsquo;t think that Thanos&rsquo;s campaign for the stones that we&rsquo;ve observed over the course of the last six years is the first time he&rsquo;s tried it. As a matter of fact, I think he has very nearly succeeded in the past, only to be stopped by Odin, and presumably, Hela. My evidence? This lovely little bit from Thor: Ragnarok:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/de4a4438041776341a4709975bd78cc7/tumblr_pc1sqpz8HI1vf95a1_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Now, this clip poses us at the very least three questions.</p><ol><li>How (and why) is there a model of the Infinity Gauntlet in Odin&rsquo;s vault?</li><li>How (and why) would Hela know it&rsquo;s fake?</li><li>Why is said Infinity Gauntlet an exact replica in all means of size and detail as the one seen being worn and used by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War?</li></ol><p>The solution that best answers all of these questions is that Thanos has in fact tried this whole exact scheme of harnessing the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the population of the universe. As a matter of fact, I think the idea is more that possible. </p><p>In most continuities of comics, if he isn&rsquo;t in fact immortal, Thanos is very, VERY old. So, even despite the massive differences between comic  Thanos and MCU Thanos, it would at least make sense for MCU Thanos to be ancient as well. Perhaps even as old as Odin. So there&rsquo;s one thing.</p><p>Second, we know that Thanos seems to be exceptionally good at tracking and collecting Infinity Stones. Heck he has the mind stone in his hands right from he get go. It might make sense that he got this good at it from experience. Nearly bringing them all together once before. Before having them slipped from his grasp and once again spread across the galaxy. Or at least he&rsquo;s good at doing so when he&rsquo;s doing it himself, and not hiding behind proxies like Loki and Ronan. Speaking of which&hellip;</p><p>Why would someone as massively capable as Thanos the Mad Titan, feared and dreaded by all, be hiding behind puppets? Because he&rsquo;s lazy? No, can&rsquo;t be that. This guy&rsquo;s spent some ungodly amount of indeterminate time doing nothing but planet hopping and personally murdering half the populations of each. So obviously, the guy&rsquo;s not the throne potatoe we all like to joke about. </p><p>So, maybe he just believed that all this hands on slaughter was more important? No, he&rsquo;s all too willing to bring an end to the practice to pursue the Infinity Stones once Ronan fails, and he seems to be of the mind set that the quickest, least painful way of culling the universe is the best way. So that really wouldn&rsquo;t make sense. </p><p>That leaves us with a third option, and one I think very likely. He doesn&rsquo;t want to draw attention to himself. But attention from who might you ask? </p><p>The Nova Corps? Obviously not. He annihilated them easily without even a single Infinity Stone. </p><p>The Eternals? Not them either. He walked right up to The Collector and merc&rsquo;d the hell out of him. </p><p>What about Celestials, like Ego? Clearly not. Hell, Ego had been planning to wipe out all life anyway, so what&rsquo;s he care if some purple ego maniac does half the work for him? </p><p>That leaves us with only one real presence in the universe to be hiding from. Asgard. The same folks who just so happen to have an exact replica of his handy dandy Infinify Gauntlet locked up in Odin&rsquo;s vault of super deadly weapons collected from his enemies that should never ever under any circumstances ever be tampered with.</p><p>So now that we&rsquo;ve funneled it down to this, I have one final bit of evidence.
