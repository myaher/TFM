I\u2019m not aware that Spider Sense is limited to alerts based on the kind of danger perceived.

There are elements that necessarily eluded me on Kraven\u2019s end, lacking as I am in a meaningful grounding in either the Russian Revolution or the works of William Blake, but at the end of the day they\u2019re simply incredibly good, even if the nature of its incarnation was something of happenstance.</p><p>But the truth is, that this project ended up a Spider-Man story is crucial to how it ultimately works, far beyond Peter\u2019s inherent ability to rightfully freak the fuck out at his circumstances in a way Bruce Wayne could never entirely pull off (though that element, and how well it works here, really does make this the genesis of the particular breed of Serious Spider-Man Stories that I\u2019ve always loved, even as I know they shouldn\u2019t constitute Pete\u2019s bread and butter). As an artifact unto itself, as a singular\u00a0\u2018graphic novel\u2019 thesis on Parker, it\u2019s the ultimate statement against, and ultimately redemption of, the concept of him as a larger-than-life figure. Kraven\u2019s modeled his entire life around refusing to accept the humble Earthliness of things in search of a greater purpose, casting himself the noble scion of a lost kingdom of glory, turned champion against the great monsters of the world, because the alternative is that he\u2019s a 70 year old man with likely undiagnosed mental illness who hunts down and shoots a college dropout in the face before getting in a wrestling match with an overgrown sewer rat to try and get over his midlife crisis. And he so nearly pushes Peter into that same mindset with drugs and isolation and savagery, but in the end, no; just like the supposed Vermin who stalks the corners of the piece, he\u2019s just a dude. So profoundly just a dude that even a lifetime of pathology and self-delusion can\u2019t stop Kraven from recognizing it in the end. Yet even as he brings his own story to an end, satisfied and unable to see another purpose in life, Sergei sees the greater truth: Peter may not have been The Spider, but Spider-Man was <i>his</i> Spider, just as he has been to so many others, and that battle and that story truly is something miraculous and worth taking pride in.</p><p>Outside its isolated context however, at least for me, it takes the role of climax to a greater narrative arc of Spider-Man vs. Depression.

And what they consistently present in the unwitting leadup to this is a Peter Parker whose life isn\u2019t rocked by constant disaster and upheaval, but is just believably shitty and mundane and <b>empty</b>, made up of unrewarding routines, drab surroundings and a handful of compromised half-formed relationships. He\u2019s thinking hard about giving up as Spider-Man again, consciously wondering at one point why he isn\u2019t happy with his life as things stand, and most of all he\u2019s reeling from his encounter with Wolverine. An encounter that not only resulted in the death of an acquaintance, but threw him into a narrative space where he as a traditional superhero simply doesn\u2019t function, rendered emasculated and ineffectual in the face of a very different model of superheroic realism culminating in blood on his own hands. He wanders through the aftermath in a daze, even as he primarily (and as I know you discuss on your blog <i><a href=\"https://thekinginredandblue.blogspot.com/\">Fearful Symmetry</a>\u00a0-</i>\u00a0which I\u2019m finally reading now that I\u2019ve read this - crucially) focuses on Ned\u2019s loss rather than taking a life himself, his sole meaningful respite his love and ultimately marriage to* Mary Jane. But just as the haze seems to be lifting and life feels real and meaningful again, the hammer comes down when the darkness is over him again for a moment in the wake of another death, sending him spiraling into a hallucinatory nervous breakdown. It\u2019s only by readmitting his vulnerability to himself, by holding on to the single emotional tether he\u2019s permitted himself in his wife, and by in the end refusing to succumb to the panic and hate threatening to take him over, that he literally crawls up out of the ground twice, once out of the ground and the second time back into the light.</p><p>It\u2019s not as good as the Kraven arc in <i>Squirrel Girl</i> though.

There are elements that necessarily eluded me on Kraven\u2019s end, lacking as I am in a meaningful grounding in either the Russian Revolution or the works of William Blake, but at the end of the day they\u2019re simply incredibly good, even if the nature of its incarnation was something of happenstance.</p><p>But the truth is, that this project ended up a Spider-Man story is crucial to how it ultimately works, far beyond Peter\u2019s inherent ability to rightfully freak the fuck out at his circumstances in a way Bruce Wayne could never entirely pull off (though that element, and how well it works here, really does make this the genesis of the particular breed of Serious Spider-Man Stories that I\u2019ve always loved, even as I know they shouldn\u2019t constitute Pete\u2019s bread and butter). As an artifact unto itself, as a singular\u00a0\u2018graphic novel\u2019 thesis on Parker, it\u2019s the ultimate statement against, and ultimately redemption of, the concept of him as a larger-than-life figure. Kraven\u2019s modeled his entire life around refusing to accept the humble Earthliness of things in search of a greater purpose, casting himself the noble scion of a lost kingdom of glory, turned champion against the great monsters of the world, because the alternative is that he\u2019s a 70 year old man with likely undiagnosed mental illness who hunts down and shoots a college dropout in the face before getting in a wrestling match with an overgrown sewer rat to try and get over his midlife crisis. And he so nearly pushes Peter into that same mindset with drugs and isolation and savagery, but in the end, no; just like the supposed Vermin who stalks the corners of the piece, he\u2019s just a dude. So profoundly just a dude that even a lifetime of pathology and self-delusion can\u2019t stop Kraven from recognizing it in the end. Yet even as he brings his own story to an end, satisfied and unable to see another purpose in life, Sergei sees the greater truth: Peter may not have been The Spider, but Spider-Man was <i>his</i> Spider, just as he has been to so many others, and that battle and that story truly is something miraculous and worth taking pride in.</p><p>Outside its isolated context however, at least for me, it takes the role of climax to a greater narrative arc of Spider-Man vs. Depression. See, the form I happened to read this in was\u00a0\u201c<i>The Amazing Spider-Man Epic Collection Vol. 17</i>\u2033, which also includes <i>Amazing Spider-Man </i>#289-292 + annuals 20 &amp; 21, <i>Spider-Man Versus Wolverine</i>, and <i>Web of Spider-Man</i> #29-30. And what they consistently present in the unwitting leadup to this is a Peter Parker whose life isn\u2019t rocked by constant disaster and upheaval, but is just believably shitty and mundane and <b>empty</b>, made up of unrewarding routines, drab surroundings and a handful of compromised half-formed relationships. He\u2019s thinking hard about giving up as Spider-Man again, consciously wondering at one point why he isn\u2019t happy with his life as things stand, and most of all he\u2019s reeling from his encounter with Wolverine. An encounter that not only resulted in the death of an acquaintance, but threw him into a narrative space where he as a traditional superhero simply doesn\u2019t function, rendered emasculated and ineffectual in the face of a very different model of superheroic realism culminating in blood on his own hands. He wanders through the aftermath in a daze, even as he primarily (and as I know you discuss on your blog <i><a href=\"https://thekinginredandblue.blogspot.com/\">Fearful Symmetry</a>\u00a0-</i>\u00a0which I\u2019m finally reading now that I\u2019ve read this - crucially) focuses on Ned\u2019s loss rather than taking a life himself, his sole meaningful respite his love and ultimately marriage to* Mary Jane. But just as the haze seems to be lifting and life feels real and meaningful again, the hammer comes down when the darkness is over him again for a moment in the wake of another death, sending him spiraling into a hallucinatory nervous breakdown. It\u2019s only by readmitting his vulnerability to himself, by holding on to the single emotional tether he\u2019s permitted himself in his wife, and by in the end refusing to succumb to the panic and hate threatening to take him over, that he literally crawls up out of the ground twice, once out of the ground and the second time back into the light.</p><p>It\u2019s not as good as the Kraven arc in <i>Squirrel Girl</i> though. But still pretty good.</p><p>* Speaking as a fan of the Spider-Marriage, and having just read it and the context around it for the first time:\nHoly SHIT that did not work and I don\u2019t blame creators throwing fits behind the scenes. The annual itself is great, but in the leadup - literally the issue before the proposal - Peter and MJ are kinda unofficially seeing each other and also he\u2019s still clearly hooking up with Black Cat.\u00a0\n\nAnd then in one issue he decides \u201c<i>something feels incomplete, I should get my life as Peter sorted out</i>\u201d and pops the question out of fucking NOWHERE. MJ is understandably like \u201cum???\u201d but then accepts a couple issues later and that\u2019s that.\n\nIt\u2019s UNBELIEVABLY weird. Not\u00a0 that Peter Fuckin\u2019 Parker could do something that stupid if he\u2019d had a bad enough time of things recently to fry his head (which he most definitely had), but that it in any way works out.</p>",
