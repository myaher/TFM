I can\u2019t take it. I miss you, I miss Lennie. This is the most time we\u2019ve spent with one another since she was born 2 months ago. She needs us. I need us. Please, just let me explain, no excuses. And even after all of it, if you still don\u2019t want me, I\u2019ll let you go, just please let me try. Now, let\u2019s go inside and chat, yeah?\u201d Harry asks looking her in the eyes and putting a strand of her beautiful hair behind her ear.\u00a0</i><br/></p><hr><p>\u201cY/N \u2014 baby, listen to me, here I am, in front of you trying to tell you tha\u2019 I don\u2019t even remember sleeping with this woman. I don\u2019t know how the panties got in my pocket. I\u2019m not in denial about anything, my love. I truly, truly do not even remember sleeping with anyone. I could say tha\u2019 I was drunk and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and tha\u2019 it was a mistake, but I know that none of tha\u2019 will fix what I\u2019ve done. So I stand here today, on what has been one of the greatest days we\u2019ve ever experienced as a family, and I vow to show you that I will change. I need to be better for you and for Lennon. I love yeh, so, so much and I\u2019m sorry tha\u2019 I hurt yeh. But I truly believe tha\u2019 we are stronger than one mistake. Than my mistake.\u201d Harry was begging now, practically on his knees in front of his wife. </p><p>\u201cHarry, honey. What you did was nearly unforgivable. I never, ever thought that you of all people would hurt me so badly. And the fact that you did it before our child even got to experience a real family is unfathomable. But you\u2019ve been here for her lately, regardless of our situation. And that\u2019s what matters. I\u2019m happy to continue to be with you when Lennie is involved, but I don\u2019t think we can ever get back to what we were. I\u2019m sorry, Harry. You should probably go. Lennon\u2019s suitcase is packed and waiting by the door. I\u2019ll pick her up Wednesday after work or Gemma will. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as I can.\u201d Y/N says wiping hastily at her teary eyes and kissing her baby goodbye as she turns to leave the room and head upstairs. </p><p>\u201cY/N, love! Wait I\u2014\u201d Harry makes a move to run up the stairs after her but hears a door slam shut. </p><p>\u201cWell, little bird, I guess it\u2019s just you and me. Let\u2019s go, love.\u201d Harry says to Lennon as she looks up at her father and chews on her fingers. Clueless to the chaos that is her parents lives. </p><p>Meanwhile, upstairs in the master suite of her home, Y/N cries into her knees as she brings them up to her chest in the bathtub. The water from the shower is cascading down her back; the falling water drowning out the sounds of her muffled cries. </p><!-- more --><p><i>\u201cC\u2019mon my love. You\u2019ve got this! One more push and our little bird will be here! You can do it!\u201d Harry encouraged. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t, H. It hurts too much.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes you can, baby. Don\u2019t you want to meet our baby girl? She\u2019ll be so lucky to have you as her mummy. I know it.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Those few words gave Y/N all the encouragement she needed to bring their little love into the world. As the doctor laid the baby on Y/N\u2019s chest, she looked at Harry and saw him looking at her and their daughter with more pride and love than he ever thought possible. No awards or number one singles or albums could ever amount to a moment so breathtaking and incredible as seeing one\u2019s wife birth his first born. She (the baby) was so pure and so good. Being brought into a world that had all recently turned to shit. On what should have been the happiest day of their lives, without question it held an air of misfortune. Knowing that when Y/N and Harry brought their daughter home later that day he would not get to stay. But for that moment, in that hospital room as new parents, they were a family. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWelcome to the world, Lennon Gemma Styles. We\u2019ve been waiting for you a long time.\u201d Y/N said, crying and she stroked her daughter\u2019s cheek.</i></p><hr><p>Later that day when harry came home from visiting Adam and his children with baby Lennie he noticed a piece of paper wedged in the door of his apartment. With Lennon in her baby Bj\u00f6rn on his chest he kissed her head and read the note </p><p><i><b>H, </b></i></p><p><i><b>There\u2019s something I need to tell you. Meet me at Daunt Books at 5 pm. I\u2019ll be waiting by the stairs. </b></i></p><p><i><b>C. </b></i></p><p>Huh. \u201cI wonder what this could be about, little bird.\u201d Harry wondered aloud. Checking his watch, he noticed that it was only 3 pm. He still had 2 hours before he had to meet this mystery informant. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a snack, yeah? Are yeh hungry pretty girl?\u201d He smiled at her, unstrapping her from the Bj\u00f6rn and walking her into the kitchen. </p><hr><p>\u00a0<b>*** At the bookstore ***\u00a0</b></p><p>\u201cPssttt. Harry, over here!\u201d He hears a feminine voice whisper. Just then a small dark haired figure emerges from behind the bookstore staircase. </p><p>\u201cCayla? That are you doing here?\u201d Harry asks, dumbfounded. </p><p>\u201cH. There\u2019s something you need to know about what happened that night on tour.\u201d Cayla says taking Lennon\u2019s small hand in her own as she stands in front of Harry. </p><p>\u201cIt was Jeff\u2019s fault, Harry. Not yours. He put E (ecstasy) in your drink that night. Why do you think you couldn\u2019t remember anything the next day? I told myself I wasn\u2019t going to tell you, I would just let it be. But I can\u2019t stand to see your world falling apart.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t touch my daughter. And second, why didn\u2019t you come forward months ago when my world was crashing down around me? Huh? I lost everything because of what \u2018supposedly\u2019 happened that night! For the last 5 months the love of my life has hated me! And for the last 2 months my baby girl has grown up without both of her parents together! But\u2026 how do I know you\u2019re telling the truth? Why would Jeff even do something like that? Also, don\u2019t call me \u201cH\u201d that title is reserved for my wife and family.\u201d Harry seethes, stepping away and shielding his daughter from the woman who has all but ruined his life. </p><p>\u201cJeff isn\u2019t who you think he is, Harry. You can trust me on that. I know I\u2019m likely to be the very last person on this planet that you should trust, but for the sake of your marriage and your daughter, please just hear me out. Jeff planned this for months, Harry. I\u2019m an actress, Jeff spiked your drink at the bar in Toronto that night and told me to convince you that we slept together. He told me that if I didn\u2019t he would ruin my career, so I took you back to your hotel room and placed my panties in your pocket. All we did that night was sleep, I promise you that. I even have the video of him spiking your drink on my phone. Here.\u201d Cayla says, passing Harry her phone. </p><p><b>** In the video **\u00a0\u00a0</b></p><p><b>**</b><i>Jeff is seen dropping which, would most likely have been an ecstasy tab into Harry\u2019s gin and cranberry juice while H is off in the distance somewhere. ** \u201cNow, Cayla\u2026 here\u2019s the plan, once H drinks this I want you to do whatever you need to in order to get him to leave with you.\u201d Jeff says. </i></p><p><i> \u201cWhy are you doing this Jeff? What has Harry \u2013 or his poor wife ever done to you?\u201d Cayla replies. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything \u2013 yet. But that bitch, Y/N is ruining his life. She\u2019s always held him back. Being his classic ball and chain. And now, she\u2019s pregnant! Soon enough, he\u2019ll stop touring and maybe even performing altogether, and I\u2019ll be out of a job. But I\u2019m not just doing this for me. I\u2019m saving all of our careers. Mitch\u2019s, Adam\u2019s, Clare\u2019s, Sarah\u2019s and especially Harry\u2019s. Great songs come from painful experiences so just imagine what a divorce and single parenthood could do for Harry\u2019s career. I can just smell a number one album in the works. And don\u2019t think I forgot about you.\u201d Jeff smirks, as he passes Cayla an envelope across the bar. $10,000 in cash. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can expect the other half when the job is complete and done to my satisfaction.\u201d</i></p><p><b>** End vid **</b></p><p>\u201cHe sent me the other half of the money when news broke that you and Y/N had separated. I wanted to tell you about it right away, but I had no other way to reach you other than making the trip out here. And I had absolutely no intention of bringing what I had done to the attention of the press. so until I had the money, I couldn\u2019t truly repent for what I\u2019ve done. I don\u2019t want Jeff\u2019s dirty money. So please, please accept my apology. I hope everything works out for you.\u201d Cayla cries, tearing up as she hands Harry a USB drive and an envelope with $20,000 in cash inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate your apology Cayla. But I\u2019m fairly certain my relationship with my wife is far beyond repair. Unless by some miracle she believes this crazy tale and forgives me. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I think I need some air.\u201d Harry nods as he departs up the stairs of the bookshop and down the familiar London streets. </p><p>\u201cHey, Gem, it\u2019s kind of a long story, but could you meet me at my apartment in 20? I need you to watch Len for a bit. I\u2019ll explain everything as best I can when you get here, just please hurry.\u201d Harry says in a breathless panic over the phone. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course, H. calm down I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Gemma replies. </p><p>\u201cH? are you home? I came as soon as I could.\u201d Gemma says calling out into the apartment for her baby brother and niece.</p><p>Gemma soon finds Harry holding Lennon to his chest and crying rather heavily. </p><p>\u201cOh, God, H are you ok? Is it Lennon?\u201d Gemma wonders kneeling down in front of Harry. </p><p>\u201cN-No, we\u2019re fine, physically\u2026 b-but there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d Harry stutters, as he proceeds to tell his sister what happened that fateful night. </p><p>* * * </p><p>\u201cI \u2013 wow, H. this is unbelievable. You need to go to her, now. I\u2019ll watch the princess. Now go get your girl, Har. And we\u2019ll bring that bastard down soon enough.\u201d Gemma responds taking Lennon from Harry so he can stand from the sofa. </p><p>\u201cOkay, bye baby girl. Daddy loves you so much. I\u2019ll be back, hopefully with mumma. See you soon.\u201d Harry coos at his baby girl, kissing her forehead as she squirms and sleeps in Gemma\u2019s arms. </p><hr><p><b>*** At Y/N\u2019s house ***</b></p><p>After her bath and therapeutic crying session earlier in the day, Y/N had finally made peace with the fact that her marriage may truly be over, while also pining over what she and Harry once were. But deep down she knew that she never wanted it to end. </p><p>Suddenly a faint knock at the front door brought her out of her trance and she peeled her eyes away from her wedding album, making her way down the stairs. </p><p>Opening the door to the most welcoming sight she had seen all day \u2013 her former knight in shining armour. \u201cH-hey, H. what are you doing here?\u201d Y/N questions wiping tears from her eyes. Her face soon void of any emotion other than the trail of tears glistening on her puffy red cheeks. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cBaby, there\u2019s something I really need to tell you. \u2013 Wait\u2026 have you been crying?\u201d He rebuttals, rubbing a thumb over Y/N\u2019s soft, rosy cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, H, I\u2019m fine, promise. What are you doing here? Where\u2019s little bird?\u201d his wife asks, slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, love. She\u2019s with Gem at the apartment. I had to come alone, quickly. You may want to sit down for what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Is it bad? It\u2019s that girl isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s pregnant, isn\u2019t she? Oh, God, I knew it.\u201d Y/N cries breaking down into an even bigger puddle of tears and collapsing into Harry\u2019s chest. </p><p>Though extremely mortified by her train of thought, Harry can\u2019t help but let out the tiniest chuckle. \u201cActually, my love, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to talk to you about. It\u2019s extremely good news \u2013 well, if you could call it that I guess.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what?! You\u2019re happy that you knocked up your mistress?!\u201d Y/N shrieks in horror looking up at Harry\u2019s emerald green eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo, baby, she\u2019s not pregnant, I promise. Let\u2019s go upstairs and chat shall we?\u201d He suggests, suddenly getting serious as he takes her by the hand and leads her up the stairs to their (well her) bedroom. </p><p>Before he begins his explanation of that night his eyes can\u2019t help but drift to the photo album laid out on their bed. On display are two photos representing the two happiest days of his life \u2013 his wedding day, and the birth of his little precious princess. He owes every happiness during those days, and every other day for the last 6 years to his beautiful wife. He can only hope that what he reveals to her in the next hour or so will be able to restore that happiness and not only repair, but strengthen their bonds as a couple and a family. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \t\t\t* \t\t\t*</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 ?! But why would Jeff do something so cruel? What did you or I ever do to him?\u201d Y/N asks, clearly baffled by the situation and the video that she had just witnessed. \u201cHe ruined everything for us, H! I\u2019m so sorry, baby. I\u2019m sorry I kept Lennon from you for so long, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t believe you, baby.\u201d Y/N cries, collapsing into Harry\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cNo, baby, shh. It\u2019s not your fault beautiful. Not even I knew what was real. Now, can we put this all behind us and move on?\u201d Harry smiles, wiping his wife\u2019s tears from her cheeks before looking her in the eyes as if to ask her permission to kiss her. </p><p>Y/N nods quickly and stands on her tippy toes to reach her husband\u2019s lips, pulling him into the most passionate kiss that they have shared in over 5 excruciatingly painful months spent apart. Y/N is quick to push her husband down on the bed and straddle him, all without detaching their lips. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cMhm, Y/N, baby\u2026 wait. As much as I would love to make love to you right now, I think we are both a little bit too vulnerable. Let\u2019s just call Gem and tell her to bring little bird home, yeah? I missed my girls. Can we just spend tonight as a family? I\u2019ve not had both m\u2019girls together for longer than a day before.\u201d H smiles as he says this, looking up at his wife with the purest and loving expression. </p><p>\u201cOf course we can, my love. But tomorrow, we make love. After we bring down that smug bastard. Now let\u2019s get our baby over here.\u201d Y/N assures.\u00a0<br/></p><p>What did ya\u2019ll think?! feedback is LOVE!!\u00a0</p>",

One more push and our little bird will be here! You can do it!\u201d Harry encouraged. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t, H. It hurts too much.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes you can, baby. Don\u2019t you want to meet our baby girl? She\u2019ll be so lucky to have you as her mummy. I know it.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Those few words gave Y/N all the encouragement she needed to bring their little love into the world. As the doctor laid the baby on Y/N\u2019s chest, she looked at Harry and saw him looking at her and their daughter with more pride and love than he ever thought possible. No awards or number one singles or albums could ever amount to a moment so breathtaking and incredible as seeing one\u2019s wife birth his first born. She (the baby) was so pure and so good. Being brought into a world that had all recently turned to shit. On what should have been the happiest day of their lives, without question it held an air of misfortune. Knowing that when Y/N and Harry brought their daughter home later that day he would not get to stay. But for that moment, in that hospital room as new parents, they were a family. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWelcome to the world, Lennon Gemma Styles. We\u2019ve been waiting for you a long time.\u201d Y/N said, crying and she stroked her daughter\u2019s cheek.</i></p><hr><p>Later that day when harry came home from visiting Adam and his children with baby Lennie he noticed a piece of paper wedged in the door of his apartment. With Lennon in her baby Bj\u00f6rn on his chest he kissed her head and read the note </p><p><i><b>H, </b></i></p><p><i><b>There\u2019s something I need to tell you. Meet me at Daunt Books at 5 pm. I\u2019ll be waiting by the stairs. </b></i></p><p><i><b>C. </b></i></p><p>Huh. \u201cI wonder what this could be about, little bird.\u201d Harry wondered aloud. Checking his watch, he noticed that it was only 3 pm. He still had 2 hours before he had to meet this mystery informant. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a snack, yeah? Are yeh hungry pretty girl?\u201d He smiled at her, unstrapping her from the Bj\u00f6rn and walking her into the kitchen. </p><hr><p>\u00a0<b>*** At the bookstore ***\u00a0</b></p><p>\u201cPssttt. Harry, over here!\u201d He hears a feminine voice whisper. Just then a small dark haired figure emerges from behind the bookstore staircase. </p><p>\u201cCayla? That are you doing here?\u201d Harry asks, dumbfounded. </p><p>\u201cH. There\u2019s something you need to know about what happened that night on tour.\u201d Cayla says taking Lennon\u2019s small hand in her own as she stands in front of Harry. </p><p>\u201cIt was Jeff\u2019s fault, Harry. Not yours. He put E (ecstasy) in your drink that night. Why do you think you couldn\u2019t remember anything the next day? I told myself I wasn\u2019t going to tell you, I would just let it be. But I can\u2019t stand to see your world falling apart.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t touch my daughter. And second, why didn\u2019t you come forward months ago when my world was crashing down around me? Huh? I lost everything because of what \u2018supposedly\u2019 happened that night! For the last 5 months the love of my life has hated me! And for the last 2 months my baby girl has grown up without both of her parents together! But\u2026 how do I know you\u2019re telling the truth? Why would Jeff even do something like that? Also, don\u2019t call me \u201cH\u201d that title is reserved for my wife and family.\u201d Harry seethes, stepping away and shielding his daughter from the woman who has all but ruined his life. </p><p>\u201cJeff isn\u2019t who you think he is, Harry. You can trust me on that. I know I\u2019m likely to be the very last person on this planet that you should trust, but for the sake of your marriage and your daughter, please just hear me out. Jeff planned this for months, Harry. I\u2019m an actress, Jeff spiked your drink at the bar in Toronto that night and told me to convince you that we slept together. He told me that if I didn\u2019t he would ruin my career, so I took you back to your hotel room and placed my panties in your pocket. All we did that night was sleep, I promise you that. I even have the video of him spiking your drink on my phone. Here.\u201d Cayla says, passing Harry her phone. </p><p><b>** In the video **\u00a0\u00a0</b></p><p><b>**</b><i>Jeff is seen dropping which, would most likely have been an ecstasy tab into Harry\u2019s gin and cranberry juice while H is off in the distance somewhere. ** \u201cNow, Cayla\u2026 here\u2019s the plan, once H drinks this I want you to do whatever you need to in order to get him to leave with you.\u201d Jeff says. </i></p><p><i> \u201cWhy are you doing this Jeff? What has Harry \u2013 or his poor wife ever done to you?\u201d Cayla replies. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything \u2013 yet. But that bitch, Y/N is ruining his life. She\u2019s always held him back. Being his classic ball and chain. And now, she\u2019s pregnant! Soon enough, he\u2019ll stop touring and maybe even performing altogether, and I\u2019ll be out of a job. But I\u2019m not just doing this for me. I\u2019m saving all of our careers. Mitch\u2019s, Adam\u2019s, Clare\u2019s, Sarah\u2019s and especially Harry\u2019s. Great songs come from painful experiences so just imagine what a divorce and single parenthood could do for Harry\u2019s career. I can just smell a number one album in the works. And don\u2019t think I forgot about you.\u201d Jeff smirks, as he passes Cayla an envelope across the bar. $10,000 in cash. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can expect the other half when the job is complete and done to my satisfaction.\u201d</i></p><p><b>** End vid **</b></p><p>\u201cHe sent me the other half of the money when news broke that you and Y/N had separated. I wanted to tell you about it right away, but I had no other way to reach you other than making the trip out here. And I had absolutely no intention of bringing what I had done to the attention of the press. so until I had the money, I couldn\u2019t truly repent for what I\u2019ve done. I don\u2019t want Jeff\u2019s dirty money. So please, please accept my apology. I hope everything works out for you.\u201d Cayla cries, tearing up as she hands Harry a USB drive and an envelope with $20,000 in cash inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate your apology Cayla. But I\u2019m fairly certain my relationship with my wife is far beyond repair. Unless by some miracle she believes this crazy tale and forgives me. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I think I need some air.\u201d Harry nods as he departs up the stairs of the bookshop and down the familiar London streets. </p><p>\u201cHey, Gem, it\u2019s kind of a long story, but could you meet me at my apartment in 20? I need you to watch Len for a bit. I\u2019ll explain everything as best I can when you get here, just please hurry.\u201d Harry says in a breathless panic over the phone. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course, H. calm down I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Gemma replies. </p><p>\u201cH? are you home? I came as soon as I could.\u201d Gemma says calling out into the apartment for her baby brother and niece.</p><p>Gemma soon finds Harry holding Lennon to his chest and crying rather heavily. </p><p>\u201cOh, God, H are you ok? Is it Lennon?\u201d Gemma wonders kneeling down in front of Harry. </p><p>\u201cN-No, we\u2019re fine, physically\u2026 b-but there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d Harry stutters, as he proceeds to tell his sister what happened that fateful night. </p><p>* * * </p><p>\u201cI \u2013 wow, H. this is unbelievable. You need to go to her, now. I\u2019ll watch the princess. Now go get your girl, Har. And we\u2019ll bring that bastard down soon enough.\u201d Gemma responds taking Lennon from Harry so he can stand from the sofa. </p><p>\u201cOkay, bye baby girl. Daddy loves you so much. I\u2019ll be back, hopefully with mumma. See you soon.\u201d Harry coos at his baby girl, kissing her forehead as she squirms and sleeps in Gemma\u2019s arms. </p><hr><p><b>*** At Y/N\u2019s house ***</b></p><p>After her bath and therapeutic crying session earlier in the day, Y/N had finally made peace with the fact that her marriage may truly be over, while also pining over what she and Harry once were. But deep down she knew that she never wanted it to end. </p><p>Suddenly a faint knock at the front door brought her out of her trance and she peeled her eyes away from her wedding album, making her way down the stairs. </p><p>Opening the door to the most welcoming sight she had seen all day \u2013 her former knight in shining armour. \u201cH-hey, H. what are you doing here?\u201d Y/N questions wiping tears from her eyes. Her face soon void of any emotion other than the trail of tears glistening on her puffy red cheeks. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cBaby, there\u2019s something I really need to tell you. \u2013 Wait\u2026 have you been crying?\u201d He rebuttals, rubbing a thumb over Y/N\u2019s soft, rosy cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, H, I\u2019m fine, promise. What are you doing here? Where\u2019s little bird?\u201d his wife asks, slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, love. She\u2019s with Gem at the apartment. I had to come alone, quickly. You may want to sit down for what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Is it bad? It\u2019s that girl isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s pregnant, isn\u2019t she? Oh, God, I knew it.\u201d Y/N cries breaking down into an even bigger puddle of tears and collapsing into Harry\u2019s chest. </p><p>Though extremely mortified by her train of thought, Harry can\u2019t help but let out the tiniest chuckle. \u201cActually, my love, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to talk to you about. It\u2019s extremely good news \u2013 well, if you could call it that I guess.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what?! You\u2019re happy that you knocked up your mistress?!\u201d Y/N shrieks in horror looking up at Harry\u2019s emerald green eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo, baby, she\u2019s not pregnant, I promise. Let\u2019s go upstairs and chat shall we?\u201d He suggests, suddenly getting serious as he takes her by the hand and leads her up the stairs to their (well her) bedroom. </p><p>Before he begins his explanation of that night his eyes can\u2019t help but drift to the photo album laid out on their bed. On display are two photos representing the two happiest days of his life \u2013 his wedding day, and the birth of his little precious princess. He owes every happiness during those days, and every other day for the last 6 years to his beautiful wife. He can only hope that what he reveals to her in the next hour or so will be able to restore that happiness and not only repair, but strengthen their bonds as a couple and a family. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \t\t\t* \t\t\t*</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 ?! But why would Jeff do something so cruel? What did you or I ever do to him?\u201d Y/N asks, clearly baffled by the situation and the video that she had just witnessed. \u201cHe ruined everything for us, H! I\u2019m so sorry, baby. I\u2019m sorry I kept Lennon from you for so long, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t believe you, baby.\u201d Y/N cries, collapsing into Harry\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cNo, baby, shh. It\u2019s not your fault beautiful. Not even I knew what was real. Now, can we put this all behind us and move on?\u201d Harry smiles, wiping his wife\u2019s tears from her cheeks before looking her in the eyes as if to ask her permission to kiss her. </p><p>Y/N nods quickly and stands on her tippy toes to reach her husband\u2019s lips, pulling him into the most passionate kiss that they have shared in over 5 excruciatingly painful months spent apart. Y/N is quick to push her husband down on the bed and straddle him, all without detaching their lips. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cMhm, Y/N, baby\u2026 wait. As much as I would love to make love to you right now, I think we are both a little bit too vulnerable. Let\u2019s just call Gem and tell her to bring little bird home, yeah? I missed my girls. Can we just spend tonight as a family? I\u2019ve not had both m\u2019girls together for longer than a day before.\u201d H smiles as he says this, looking up at his wife with the purest and loving expression. </p><p>\u201cOf course we can, my love. But tomorrow, we make love. After we bring down that smug bastard. Now let\u2019s get our baby over here.\u201d Y/N assures.\u00a0<br></p><p>What did ya\u2019ll think?! feedback is LOVE!!\u00a0</p>",

Than my mistake.\u201d Harry was begging now, practically on his knees in front of his wife. </p><p>\u201cHarry, honey. What you did was nearly unforgivable. I never, ever thought that you of all people would hurt me so badly. And the fact that you did it before our child even got to experience a real family is unfathomable. But you\u2019ve been here for her lately, regardless of our situation. And that\u2019s what matters. I\u2019m happy to continue to be with you when Lennie is involved, but I don\u2019t think we can ever get back to what we were. I\u2019m sorry, Harry. You should probably go. Lennon\u2019s suitcase is packed and waiting by the door. I\u2019ll pick her up Wednesday after work or Gemma will.

Wait I\u2014\u201d Harry makes a move to run up the stairs after her but hears a door slam shut. </p><p>\u201cWell, little bird, I guess it\u2019s just you and me. Let\u2019s go, love.\u201d Harry says to Lennon as she looks up at her father and chews on her fingers. Clueless to the chaos that is her parents lives. </p><p>Meanwhile, upstairs in the master suite of her home, Y/N cries into her knees as she brings them up to her chest in the bathtub. The water from the shower is cascading down her back; the falling water drowning out the sounds of her muffled cries. </p>[[MORE]]<p><i>\u201cC\u2019mon my love. You\u2019ve got this!

As the doctor laid the baby on Y/N\u2019s chest, she looked at Harry and saw him looking at her and their daughter with more pride and love than he ever thought possible. No awards or number one singles or albums could ever amount to a moment so breathtaking and incredible as seeing one\u2019s wife birth his first born. She (the baby) was so pure and so good. Being brought into a world that had all recently turned to shit. On what should have been the happiest day of their lives, without question it held an air of misfortune. Knowing that when Y/N and Harry brought their daughter home later that day he would not get to stay. But for that moment, in that hospital room as new parents, they were a family. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWelcome to the world, Lennon Gemma Styles. We\u2019ve been waiting for you a long time.\u201d Y/N said, crying and she stroked her daughter\u2019s cheek.</i></p><hr><p>Later that day when harry came home from visiting Adam and his children with baby Lennie he noticed a piece of paper wedged in the door of his apartment. With Lennon in her baby Bj\u00f6rn on his chest he kissed her head and read the note </p><p><i><b>H, </b></i></p><p><i><b>There\u2019s something I need to tell you. Meet me at Daunt Books at 5 pm.

Are yeh hungry pretty girl?\u201d He smiled at her, unstrapping her from the Bj\u00f6rn and walking her into the kitchen. </p><hr><p>\u00a0<b>*** At the bookstore ***\u00a0</b></p><p>\u201cPssttt. Harry, over here!\u201d He hears a feminine voice whisper. Just then a small dark haired figure emerges from behind the bookstore staircase. </p><p>\u201cCayla? That are you doing here?\u201d Harry asks, dumbfounded. </p><p>\u201cH. There\u2019s something you need to know about what happened that night on tour.\u201d Cayla says taking Lennon\u2019s small hand in her own as she stands in front of Harry. </p><p>\u201cIt was Jeff\u2019s fault, Harry. Not yours. He put E (ecstasy) in your drink that night. Why do you think you couldn\u2019t remember anything the next day? I told myself I wasn\u2019t going to tell you, I would just let it be. But I can\u2019t stand to see your world falling apart.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t touch my daughter. And second, why didn\u2019t you come forward months ago when my world was crashing down around me? Huh? I lost everything because of what \u2018supposedly\u2019 happened that night! For the last 5 months the love of my life has hated me! And for the last 2 months my baby girl has grown up without both of her parents together! But\u2026 how do I know you\u2019re telling the truth? Why would Jeff even do something like that? Also, don\u2019t call me \u201cH\u201d that title is reserved for my wife and family.\u201d Harry seethes, stepping away and shielding his daughter from the woman who has all but ruined his life. </p><p>\u201cJeff isn\u2019t who you think he is, Harry. You can trust me on that. I know I\u2019m likely to be the very last person on this planet that you should trust, but for the sake of your marriage and your daughter, please just hear me out. Jeff planned this for months, Harry. I\u2019m an actress, Jeff spiked your drink at the bar in Toronto that night and told me to convince you that we slept together. He told me that if I didn\u2019t he would ruin my career, so I took you back to your hotel room and placed my panties in your pocket. All we did that night was sleep, I promise you that. I even have the video of him spiking your drink on my phone. Here.\u201d Cayla says, passing Harry her phone. </p><p><b>** In the video **\u00a0\u00a0</b></p><p><b>**</b><i>Jeff is seen dropping which, would most likely have been an ecstasy tab into Harry\u2019s gin and cranberry juice while H is off in the distance somewhere. ** \u201cNow, Cayla\u2026 here\u2019s the plan, once H drinks this I want you to do whatever you need to in order to get him to leave with you.\u201d Jeff says. </i></p><p><i> \u201cWhy are you doing this Jeff? What has Harry \u2013 or his poor wife ever done to you?\u201d Cayla replies. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything \u2013 yet. But that bitch, Y/N is ruining his life. She\u2019s always held him back. Being his classic ball and chain. And now, she\u2019s pregnant! Soon enough, he\u2019ll stop touring and maybe even performing altogether, and I\u2019ll be out of a job. But I\u2019m not just doing this for me. I\u2019m saving all of our careers. Mitch\u2019s, Adam\u2019s, Clare\u2019s, Sarah\u2019s and especially Harry\u2019s. Great songs come from painful experiences so just imagine what a divorce and single parenthood could do for Harry\u2019s career. I can just smell a number one album in the works. And don\u2019t think I forgot about you.\u201d Jeff smirks, as he passes Cayla an envelope across the bar. $10,000 in cash. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can expect the other half when the job is complete and done to my satisfaction.\u201d</i></p><p><b>** End vid **</b></p><p>\u201cHe sent me the other half of the money when news broke that you and Y/N had separated. I wanted to tell you about it right away, but I had no other way to reach you other than making the trip out here. And I had absolutely no intention of bringing what I had done to the attention of the press. so until I had the money, I couldn\u2019t truly repent for what I\u2019ve done. I don\u2019t want Jeff\u2019s dirty money. So please, please accept my apology. I hope everything works out for you.\u201d Cayla cries, tearing up as she hands Harry a USB drive and an envelope with $20,000 in cash inside.</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate your apology Cayla. But I\u2019m fairly certain my relationship with my wife is far beyond repair. Unless by some miracle she believes this crazy tale and forgives me. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I think I need some air.\u201d Harry nods as he departs up the stairs of the bookshop and down the familiar London streets. </p><p>\u201cHey, Gem, it\u2019s kind of a long story, but could you meet me at my apartment in 20? I need you to watch Len for a bit. I\u2019ll explain everything as best I can when you get here, just please hurry.\u201d Harry says in a breathless panic over the phone. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course, H. calm down I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Gemma replies. </p><p>\u201cH? are you home? I came as soon as I could.\u201d Gemma says calling out into the apartment for her baby brother and niece.</p><p>Gemma soon finds Harry holding Lennon to his chest and crying rather heavily. </p><p>\u201cOh, God, H are you ok? Is it Lennon?\u201d Gemma wonders kneeling down in front of Harry. </p><p>\u201cN-No, we\u2019re fine, physically\u2026 b-but there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d Harry stutters, as he proceeds to tell his sister what happened that fateful night. </p><p>* * * </p><p>\u201cI \u2013 wow, H. this is unbelievable. You need to go to her, now. I\u2019ll watch the princess. Now go get your girl, Har. And we\u2019ll bring that bastard down soon enough.\u201d Gemma responds taking Lennon from Harry so he can stand from the sofa. </p><p>\u201cOkay, bye baby girl. Daddy loves you so much. I\u2019ll be back, hopefully with mumma. See you soon.\u201d Harry coos at his baby girl, kissing her forehead as she squirms and sleeps in Gemma\u2019s arms. </p><hr><p><b>*** At Y/N\u2019s house ***</b></p><p>After her bath and therapeutic crying session earlier in the day, Y/N had finally made peace with the fact that her marriage may truly be over, while also pining over what she and Harry once were. But deep down she knew that she never wanted it to end. </p><p>Suddenly a faint knock at the front door brought her out of her trance and she peeled her eyes away from her wedding album, making her way down the stairs. </p><p>Opening the door to the most welcoming sight she had seen all day \u2013 her former knight in shining armour. \u201cH-hey, H. what are you doing here?\u201d Y/N questions wiping tears from her eyes. Her face soon void of any emotion other than the trail of tears glistening on her puffy red cheeks. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cBaby, there\u2019s something I really need to tell you. \u2013 Wait\u2026 have you been crying?\u201d He rebuttals, rubbing a thumb over Y/N\u2019s soft, rosy cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, H, I\u2019m fine, promise. What are you doing here? Where\u2019s little bird?\u201d his wife asks, slightly panicked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, love. She\u2019s with Gem at the apartment. I had to come alone, quickly. You may want to sit down for what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Is it bad? It\u2019s that girl isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s pregnant, isn\u2019t she? Oh, God, I knew it.\u201d Y/N cries breaking down into an even bigger puddle of tears and collapsing into Harry\u2019s chest. </p><p>Though extremely mortified by her train of thought, Harry can\u2019t help but let out the tiniest chuckle. \u201cActually, my love, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to talk to you about. It\u2019s extremely good news \u2013 well, if you could call it that I guess.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what?! You\u2019re happy that you knocked up your mistress?!\u201d Y/N shrieks in horror looking up at Harry\u2019s emerald green eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo, baby, she\u2019s not pregnant, I promise. Let\u2019s go upstairs and chat shall we?\u201d He suggests, suddenly getting serious as he takes her by the hand and leads her up the stairs to their (well her) bedroom. </p><p>Before he begins his explanation of that night his eyes can\u2019t help but drift to the photo album laid out on their bed. On display are two photos representing the two happiest days of his life \u2013 his wedding day, and the birth of his little precious princess. He owes every happiness during those days, and every other day for the last 6 years to his beautiful wife. He can only hope that what he reveals to her in the next hour or so will be able to restore that happiness and not only repair, but strengthen their bonds as a couple and a family. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \t\t\t* \t\t\t*</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 ?! But why would Jeff do something so cruel? What did you or I ever do to him?\u201d Y/N asks, clearly baffled by the situation and the video that she had just witnessed. \u201cHe ruined everything for us, H! I\u2019m so sorry, baby. I\u2019m sorry I kept Lennon from you for so long, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t believe you, baby.\u201d Y/N cries, collapsing into Harry\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cNo, baby, shh. It\u2019s not your fault beautiful. Not even I knew what was real. Now, can we put this all behind us and move on?\u201d Harry smiles, wiping his wife\u2019s tears from her cheeks before looking her in the eyes as if to ask her permission to kiss her. </p><p>Y/N nods quickly and stands on her tippy toes to reach her husband\u2019s lips, pulling him into the most passionate kiss that they have shared in over 5 excruciatingly painful months spent apart. Y/N is quick to push her husband down on the bed and straddle him, all without detaching their lips. \u00a0 </p><p>\u201cMhm, Y/N, baby\u2026 wait. As much as I would love to make love to you right now, I think we are both a little bit too vulnerable. Let\u2019s just call Gem and tell her to bring little bird home, yeah? I missed my girls. Can we just spend tonight as a family? I\u2019ve not had both m\u2019girls together for longer than a day before.\u201d H smiles as he says this, looking up at his wife with the purest and loving expression. </p><p>\u201cOf course we can, my love. But tomorrow, we make love. After we bring down that smug bastard. Now let\u2019s get our baby over here.\u201d Y/N assures.\u00a0<br></p><p>What did ya\u2019ll think?! feedback is LOVE!!\u00a0</p>",

Here.&rdquo; Cayla says, passing Harry her phone. </p><p><b>** In the video **&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>**</b><i>Jeff is seen dropping which, would most likely have been an ecstasy tab into Harry&rsquo;s gin and cranberry juice while H is off in the distance somewhere. ** &ldquo;Now, Cayla&hellip; here&rsquo;s the plan, once H drinks this I want you to do whatever you need to in order to get him to leave with you.&rdquo; Jeff says. </i></p><p><i> &ldquo;Why are you doing this Jeff? What has Harry &ndash; or his poor wife ever done to you?&rdquo; Cayla replies. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t done anything &ndash; yet. But that bitch, Y/N is ruining his life. She&rsquo;s always held him back. Being his classic ball and chain. And now, she&rsquo;s pregnant! Soon enough, he&rsquo;ll stop touring and maybe even performing altogether, and I&rsquo;ll be out of a job. But I&rsquo;m not just doing this for me. I&rsquo;m saving all of our careers. Mitch&rsquo;s, Adam&rsquo;s, Clare&rsquo;s, Sarah&rsquo;s and especially Harry&rsquo;s. Great songs come from painful experiences so just imagine what a divorce and single parenthood could do for Harry&rsquo;s career. I can just smell a number one album in the works. And don&rsquo;t think I forgot about you.&rdquo; Jeff smirks, as he passes Cayla an envelope across the bar. $10,000 in cash. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You can expect the other half when the job is complete and done to my satisfaction.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>** End vid **</b></p><p>&ldquo;He sent me the other half of the money when news broke that you and Y/N had separated. I wanted to tell you about it right away, but I had no other way to reach you other than making the trip out here. And I had absolutely no intention of bringing what I had done to the attention of the press. so until I had the money, I couldn&rsquo;t truly repent for what I&rsquo;ve done. I don&rsquo;t want Jeff&rsquo;s dirty money. So please, please accept my apology. I hope everything works out for you.&rdquo; Cayla cries, tearing up as she hands Harry a USB drive and an envelope with $20,000 in cash inside.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I appreciate your apology Cayla. But I&rsquo;m fairly certain my relationship with my wife is far beyond repair. Unless by some miracle she believes this crazy tale and forgives me. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I think I need some air.&rdquo; Harry nods as he departs up the stairs of the bookshop and down the familiar London streets. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Gem, it&rsquo;s kind of a long story, but could you meet me at my apartment in 20? I need you to watch Len for a bit. I&rsquo;ll explain everything as best I can when you get here, just please hurry.&rdquo; Harry says in a breathless panic over the phone. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Of course, H. calm down I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo; Gemma replies. </p><p>&ldquo;H? are you home? I came as soon as I could.&rdquo; Gemma says calling out into the apartment for her baby brother and niece.</p><p>Gemma soon finds Harry holding Lennon to his chest and crying rather heavily. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God, H are you ok? Is it Lennon?&rdquo; Gemma wonders kneeling down in front of Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;N-No, we&rsquo;re fine, physically&hellip; b-but there&rsquo;s something I need to tell you.&rdquo; Harry stutters, as he proceeds to tell his sister what happened that fateful night. </p><p>* * * </p><p>&ldquo;I &ndash; wow, H. this is unbelievable. You need to go to her, now. I&rsquo;ll watch the princess. Now go get your girl, Har. And we&rsquo;ll bring that bastard down soon enough.&rdquo; Gemma responds taking Lennon from Harry so he can stand from the sofa. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, bye baby girl. Daddy loves you so much. I&rsquo;ll be back, hopefully with mumma. See you soon.&rdquo; Harry coos at his baby girl, kissing her forehead as she squirms and sleeps in Gemma&rsquo;s arms. </p><hr /><p><b>*** At Y/N&rsquo;s house ***</b></p><p>After her bath and therapeutic crying session earlier in the day, Y/N had finally made peace with the fact that her marriage may truly be over, while also pining over what she and Harry once were. But deep down she knew that she never wanted it to end. </p><p>Suddenly a faint knock at the front door brought her out of her trance and she peeled her eyes away from her wedding album, making her way down the stairs. </p><p>Opening the door to the most welcoming sight she had seen all day &ndash; her former knight in shining armour. &ldquo;H-hey, H. what are you doing here?&rdquo; Y/N questions wiping tears from her eyes. Her face soon void of any emotion other than the trail of tears glistening on her puffy red cheeks. &nbsp; </p><p>&ldquo;Baby, there&rsquo;s something I really need to tell you. &ndash; Wait&hellip; have you been crying?&rdquo; He rebuttals, rubbing a thumb over Y/N&rsquo;s soft, rosy cheek. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, love?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, H, I&rsquo;m fine, promise. What are you doing here? Where&rsquo;s little bird?&rdquo; his wife asks, slightly panicked.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s okay, love. She&rsquo;s with Gem at the apartment. I had to come alone, quickly. You may want to sit down for what I&rsquo;m about to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God. Is it bad? It&rsquo;s that girl isn&rsquo;t it? She&rsquo;s pregnant, isn&rsquo;t she? Oh, God, I knew it.&rdquo; Y/N cries breaking down into an even bigger puddle of tears and collapsing into Harry&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>Though extremely mortified by her train of thought, Harry can&rsquo;t help but let out the tiniest chuckle. &ldquo;Actually, my love, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here to talk to you about. It&rsquo;s extremely good news &ndash; well, if you could call it that I guess.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?! You&rsquo;re happy that you knocked up your mistress?!&rdquo; Y/N shrieks in horror looking up at Harry&rsquo;s emerald green eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;No, baby, she&rsquo;s not pregnant, I promise. Let&rsquo;s go upstairs and chat shall we?&rdquo; He suggests, suddenly getting serious as he takes her by the hand and leads her up the stairs to their (well her) bedroom. </p><p>Before he begins his explanation of that night his eyes can&rsquo;t help but drift to the photo album laid out on their bed. On display are two photos representing the two happiest days of his life &ndash; his wedding day, and the birth of his little precious princess. He owes every happiness during those days, and every other day for the last 6 years to his beautiful wife. He can only hope that what he reveals to her in the next hour or so will be able to restore that happiness and not only repair, but strengthen their bonds as a couple and a family. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* \t\t\t* \t\t\t*</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip; ?! But why would Jeff do something so cruel? What did you or I ever do to him?&rdquo; Y/N asks, clearly baffled by the situation and the video that she had just witnessed. &ldquo;He ruined everything for us, H! I&rsquo;m so sorry, baby. I&rsquo;m sorry I kept Lennon from you for so long, I&rsquo;m so sorry I didn&rsquo;t believe you, baby.&rdquo; Y/N cries, collapsing into Harry&rsquo;s arms. </p><p>&ldquo;No, baby, shh. It&rsquo;s not your fault beautiful. Not even I knew what was real. Now, can we put this all behind us and move on?&rdquo; Harry smiles, wiping his wife&rsquo;s tears from her cheeks before looking her in the eyes as if to ask her permission to kiss her. </p><p>Y/N nods quickly and stands on her tippy toes to reach her husband&rsquo;s lips, pulling him into the most passionate kiss that they have shared in over 5 excruciatingly painful months spent apart. Y/N is quick to push her husband down on the bed and straddle him, all without detaching their lips. &nbsp; </p><p>&ldquo;Mhm, Y/N, baby&hellip; wait. As much as I would love to make love to you right now, I think we are both a little bit too vulnerable. Let&rsquo;s just call Gem and tell her to bring little bird home, yeah? I missed my girls. Can we just spend tonight as a family? I&rsquo;ve not had both m&rsquo;girls together for longer than a day before.&rdquo; H smiles as he says this, looking up at his wife with the purest and loving expression. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course we can, my love. But tomorrow, we make love. After we bring down that smug bastard. Now let&rsquo;s get our baby over here.&rdquo; Y/N assures.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>What did ya&rsquo;ll think?! feedback is LOVE!!&nbsp;</p>",

Please, just let me explain, no excuses. And even after all of it, if you still don&rsquo;t want me, I&rsquo;ll let you go, just please let me try. Now, let&rsquo;s go inside and chat, yeah?&rdquo; Harry asks looking her in the eyes and putting a strand of her beautiful hair behind her ear.&nbsp;</i><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N &mdash; baby, listen to me, here I am, in front of you trying to tell you tha&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t even remember sleeping with this woman. I don&rsquo;t know how the panties got in my pocket. I&rsquo;m not in denial about anything, my love. I truly, truly do not even remember sleeping with anyone. I could say tha&rsquo; I was drunk and I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing and tha&rsquo; it was a mistake, but I know that none of tha&rsquo; will fix what I&rsquo;ve done. So I stand here today, on what has been one of the greatest days we&rsquo;ve ever experienced as a family, and I vow to show you that I will change. I need to be better for you and for Lennon. I love yeh, so, so much and I&rsquo;m sorry tha&rsquo; I hurt yeh. But I truly believe tha&rsquo; we are stronger than one mistake. Than my mistake.&rdquo; Harry was begging now, practically on his knees in front of his wife. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Harry, honey. What you did was nearly unforgivable. I never, ever thought that you of all people would hurt me so badly. And the fact that you did it before our child even got to experience a real family is unfathomable. But you&rsquo;ve been here for her lately, regardless of our situation. And that&rsquo;s what matters. I&rsquo;m happy to continue to be with you when Lennie is involved, but I don&rsquo;t think we can ever get back to what we were. I&rsquo;m sorry, Harry. You should probably go. Lennon&rsquo;s suitcase is packed and waiting by the door. I&rsquo;ll pick her up Wednesday after work or Gemma will. I&rsquo;ll let you know as soon as I can.&rdquo; Y/N says wiping hastily at her teary eyes and kissing her baby goodbye as she turns to leave the room and head upstairs. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N, love! Wait I&mdash;&rdquo; Harry makes a move to run up the stairs after her but hears a door slam shut. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, little bird, I guess it&rsquo;s just you and me. Let&rsquo;s go, love.&rdquo; Harry says to Lennon as she looks up at her father and chews on her fingers. Clueless to the chaos that is her parents lives. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, upstairs in the master suite of her home, Y/N cries into her knees as she brings them up to her chest in the bathtub. The water from the shower is cascading down her back; the falling water drowning out the sounds of her muffled cries. </p>\n</p>",
