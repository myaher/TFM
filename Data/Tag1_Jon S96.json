Little does Ramsay know that he walks straight into a trap. If Jon shows up at least.</small></p><p><i><small>Merman AU // It contains Ramsay Bolton being his monstrous self</small></i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s heart hammered against her ribs. A thousand, or maybe even a million, thoughts were running through her head and most of all she prayed. There were so many things that could go wrong and she didn\u2019t want to think of what would happen then. </p><p>Ramsay had made his plans with her quite clear. And each and every of his plans terrified her. </p><p>But when she had tried to tell her mother about it, her mother had only assured her that every girl was terrified of her wedding night. Sansa had not even listened to the rest of her mother\u2019s so called pep talk. </p><p>Her parents had clearly no idea what kind of man Ramsay Bolton really was and what he really wanted to do with their daughter. If they had known, they certainly wouldn\u2019t have promised her hand to him in marriage. </p><p>\u201cI knew you would change your mind soon.\u201d Ramsay had his arm tightly around her shoulders. He didn\u2019t seem to notice that all her muscles were tensed. Or maybe he simply didn\u2019t care. He thought he would finally get what he wanted and probably that was all that truly mattered to him.</p><p>Sansa forced herself to smile however.</p><p>Maybe she had been hallucinating Jon Targaryen. Maybe his father would make it impossible for him to show up. Maybe he already regretted promising Sansa a way out of the miserable life that was waiting for her. Maybe she would end up regretting bringing Ramsay here, telling him that she had thought about what he had said and that she did want her first time to be here, on this beach.</p><p>Ramsay leaned towards her and his warm breath touched her ear. \u201cI can be very gentle if I want to.\u201d</p><p>She doubted if his definition and her definition of gentle were even remotely the same, but she turned her face towards him and nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d She bent her head and stared at her bare feet covered in sand. From the corner of her eyes she watched the setting sun. </p><!-- more --><p>Jon would be here at sundown. </p><p>She only had to make it through the next few minutes. </p><p>Next to the shore Ramsay stood still to face her. He had a devilish smirk on his face and there was something gleaming in his eyes that Sansa didn\u2019t quite like. There was actually quite little about him that she liked. \u201cDo you have any special wishes for tonight, my lady?\u201d </p><p>The wind carried his whispers towards her and Sansa straightened her back. \u201cYes.\u201d She spoke firmly. Her eyes scanned the surface of the sea, but she didn\u2019t see Jon anywhere. </p><p>But Jon was a merman. He could be anywhere. Hopefully he was anywhere near. </p><p>\u201cI want to do it in the sea.\u201d</p><p>The smirk on Ramsay\u2019s face brightened and in one smooth movement he pulled his shirt over his head. Looking at his bare chest almost made her throw up and once more she stared at the waves crashing on the beach. </p><p>She took one more deep breath and then she took off her thin summer dress. She didn\u2019t like how Ramsay\u2019s eyes scanned her almost naked body. She didn\u2019t like the tip of his tongue licking his lips while his glance rested on her bra. She most of all didn\u2019t like the sweaty hands he placed on her hips, his thumbs resting on the insides of her thighs. </p><p>\u201cRelax, Sansa Stark.\u201d If his touch was meant to be comforting it failed hopelessly. \u201cJust try to enjoy it. I certainly will.\u201d He pressed his lips on hers and for a moment Sansa was unable to move or kiss him back. But that didn\u2019t seem to bother Ramsay at all. </p><p>The few seconds that passed seemed to last days, but eventually he stepped back and pulled down his pants which gave Sansa the chance to rush into the sea to wash her lips with salted water.</p><p>\u201cGood\u2026\u201d Ramsay wrapped his arms around her and Sansa felt a strange and unwelcome pressure in her back. \u201cYou already made yourself wet.\u201d His hand shove down her stomach into her briefs and Sansa closed her eyes firmly. </p><p>Her lips whispered an endless prayer, but tears were stinging in her eyes when Ramsay\u2019s hand slid between her legs. </p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d </p><p>Her eyes flashed open again when she heard her name and when she saw Jon\u2019s wet black curls only a few inches away from her she gathered all the courage she had left. </p><p>An unpleasant tingle rolled down her arm when her elbow crashed into Ramsay\u2019s ribcage, but his hand was gone, his arms were gone and when she turned around she saw how dark purple tentacles curled around his wrists and ankles to keep him down in the water.</p><p>\u201cIs this the girl you were talking about, Jon Targaryen?\u201d </p><p>A shiver rolled down Sansa\u2019s back, but Jon appeared next to her and nodded firmly.</p><p>He kept his distance. He didn\u2019t place a hand on her back. He didn\u2019t wrap an arm around her. But he wore a frown on his forehead and he constantly tucked the same black curl behind his ear. </p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s your name, girl?\u201d </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t know who was talking, but when she looked at Jon he nodded once more. \u201cSansa Stark.\u201d Instinctively she reached for Jon&rsquo;s hand and she lifted her chin when their fingers entwined. </p><p>\u201cAnd you are willing to leave the human world behind?\u201d</p><p>The palms of her hands were sweating, but her voice didn\u2019t even tremble. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>She had said her goodbyes. She was sure that her parents and siblings hadn\u2019t understood that they were goodbyes, but she assumed they would figure that out soon enough. </p><p>\u201cAnd you understand you can never ever return?\u201d</p><p>She hoped they would all understand why she had done it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s grip on her hand tightened and he moved a little closer towards her. The heat of his body was comforting. But it was most of all his silence that made her feel at ease. And somehow she knew that if she would change her mind now, he would let her go. </p><p>\u201cHow will you pay for your new life?\u201d </p><p>Sansa looked at Jon and Jon gestured at Ramsay Bolton, who was gasping for air and fighting the tentacles holding him down. \u201cI will pay with the life of Lord Ramsay Bolton.\u201d She kept her eyes firmly on his struggling body.</p><p>Her parents had raised her to be compassionate, but she couldn\u2019t feel any compassion for the man who had promised her nothing but misery. And if that made her a bad person, she liked being one. </p><p>\u201cI accept your payment.\u201d </p><p>Ramsay Bolton could breath one more time before he went under again and this time for good.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to watch him die?\u201d Jon squeezed her hand and when Sansa nodded he dived down and pulled her with him.</p><p>One more time Sansa took a deep breath and with her eyes wide open she followed the crown prince into the depths of the sea. Her sight was surprisingly clear and a strange kind of warmth rushed through her veins when she saw Ramsay looking at her. </p><p>His kicking and pulling grew weaker and weaker. Eventually his entire body stilled. His chest was no longer moving up and down and the last little bubbles of air left his open mouth. </p><p>All of a sudden Sansa realised that she was not holding her breath. She was breathing. She was underwater and breathing. And when she looked at her legs and feet she noticed they were gone. Instead she was flapping a beautiful black fin. A smile spread across her face and when she looked at Jon she saw how he was smiling back at her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the kingdom?\u201d He hadn\u2019t let go of her hand and Sansa pulled him closer towards her. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She whispered. </p><p>But Jon shook his head. \u201cDon&rsquo;t thank me.\u201d He reached for her other hand too and together they were soaring in the water. \u201cI gave you an option, but you did this yourself. You chose this. You chose me.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll never regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Sansa pulled him even closer until his chest touched hers. Her arms circled around his neck. \u201cAnd there are always more fish in the sea.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s arms slid around her waist and then his nose brushed hers. \u201cBut not one as pretty and brave as you.\u201d</p><p>Kissing Jon was everything Sansa had hoped it would be. Instead of all her muscles tensing she felt herself relax. And even though they were surrounded by salted water his lips tasted as sweet as sugar. </p><p>But most of all his kiss was tender and slow. His tongue didn\u2019t touch her lips before she slightly parted them and invited him in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if minutes, hours or days had passed when they eventually pulled apart to catch their breaths. \u201cNow I want to see your kingdom.\u201d Her voice sounded a bit hoarse, but Jon tucked a strand of her bright red hair behind her ear. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no my kingdom, princess. It\u2019s yours too now. It\u2019s our kingdom.\u201d</p>",

But he wore a frown on his forehead and he constantly tucked the same black curl behind his ear. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, girl?\u201d </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t know who was talking, but when she looked at Jon he nodded once more. \u201cSansa Stark.\u201d Instinctively she reached for Jon\u2019s hand and she lifted her chin when their fingers entwined. </p><p>\u201cAnd you are willing to leave the human world behind?\u201d</p><p>The palms of her hands were sweating, but her voice didn\u2019t even tremble. \u201cYes.\u201d </p><p>She had said her goodbyes. She was sure that her parents and siblings hadn\u2019t understood that they were goodbyes, but she assumed they would figure that out soon enough. </p><p>\u201cAnd you understand you can never ever return?\u201d</p><p>She hoped they would all understand why she had done it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s grip on her hand tightened and he moved a little closer towards her. The heat of his body was comforting. But it was most of all his silence that made her feel at ease. And somehow she knew that if she would change her mind now, he would let her go. </p><p>\u201cHow will you pay for your new life?\u201d </p><p>Sansa looked at Jon and Jon gestured at Ramsay Bolton, who was gasping for air and fighting the tentacles holding him down. \u201cI will pay with the life of Lord Ramsay Bolton.\u201d She kept her eyes firmly on his struggling body.</p><p>Her parents had raised her to be compassionate, but she couldn\u2019t feel any compassion for the man who had promised her nothing but misery. And if that made her a bad person, she liked being one. </p><p>\u201cI accept your payment.\u201d </p><p>Ramsay Bolton could breath one more time before he went under again and this time for good.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to watch him die?\u201d Jon squeezed her hand and when Sansa nodded he dived down and pulled her with him.</p><p>One more time Sansa took a deep breath and with her eyes wide open she followed the crown prince into the depths of the sea. Her sight was surprisingly clear and a strange kind of warmth rushed through her veins when she saw Ramsay looking at her. </p><p>His kicking and pulling grew weaker and weaker. Eventually his entire body stilled. His chest was no longer moving up and down and the last little bubbles of air left his open mouth. </p><p>All of a sudden Sansa realised that she was not holding her breath. She was breathing. She was underwater and breathing. And when she looked at her legs and feet she noticed they were gone. Instead she was flapping a beautiful black fin. A smile spread across her face and when she looked at Jon she saw how he was smiling back at her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the kingdom?\u201d He hadn\u2019t let go of her hand and Sansa pulled him closer towards her. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She whispered. </p><p>But Jon shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me.\u201d He reached for her other hand too and together they were soaring in the water. \u201cI gave you an option, but you did this yourself. You chose this. You chose me.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll never regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Sansa pulled him even closer until his chest touched hers. Her arms circled around his neck. \u201cAnd there are always more fish in the sea.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s arms slid around her waist and then his nose brushed hers. \u201cBut not one as pretty and brave as you.\u201d</p><p>Kissing Jon was everything Sansa had hoped it would be. Instead of all her muscles tensing she felt herself relax. And even though they were surrounded by salted water his lips tasted as sweet as sugar. </p><p>But most of all his kiss was tender and slow. His tongue didn\u2019t touch her lips before she slightly parted them and invited him in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if minutes, hours or days had passed when they eventually pulled apart to catch their breaths. \u201cNow I want to see your kingdom.\u201d Her voice sounded a bit hoarse, but Jon tucked a strand of her bright red hair behind her ear. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no my kingdom, princess. It\u2019s yours too now. It\u2019s our kingdom.\u201d</p>",

A thousand, or maybe even a million, thoughts were running through her head and most of all she prayed. There were so many things that could go wrong and she didn&rsquo;t want to think of what would happen then. </p><p>Ramsay had made his plans with her quite clear. And each and every of his plans terrified her. </p><p>But when she had tried to tell her mother about it, her mother had only assured her that every girl was terrified of her wedding night. Sansa had not even listened to the rest of her mother&rsquo;s so called pep talk. </p><p>Her parents had clearly no idea what kind of man Ramsay Bolton really was and what he really wanted to do with their daughter. If they had known, they certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have promised her hand to him in marriage. </p><p>&ldquo;I knew you would change your mind soon.&rdquo; Ramsay had his arm tightly around her shoulders. He didn&rsquo;t seem to notice that all her muscles were tensed. Or maybe he simply didn&rsquo;t care. He thought he would finally get what he wanted and probably that was all that truly mattered to him.</p><p>Sansa forced herself to smile however.</p><p>Maybe she had been hallucinating Jon Targaryen. Maybe his father would make it impossible for him to show up. Maybe he already regretted promising Sansa a way out of the miserable life that was waiting for her. Maybe she would end up regretting bringing Ramsay here, telling him that she had thought about what he had said and that she did want her first time to be here, on this beach.</p><p>Ramsay leaned towards her and his warm breath touched her ear. &ldquo;I can be very gentle if I want to.&rdquo;</p><p>She doubted if his definition and her definition of gentle were even remotely the same, but she turned her face towards him and nodded. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She bent her head and stared at her bare feet covered in sand. From the corner of her eyes she watched the setting sun. </p><p>Jon would be here at sundown. </p><p>She only had to make it through the next few minutes. </p><p>Next to the shore Ramsay stood still to face her. He had a devilish smirk on his face and there was something gleaming in his eyes that Sansa didn&rsquo;t quite like. There was actually quite little about him that she liked. &ldquo;Do you have any special wishes for tonight, my lady?&rdquo; </p><p>The wind carried his whispers towards her and Sansa straightened her back. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She spoke firmly. Her eyes scanned the surface of the sea, but she didn&rsquo;t see Jon anywhere. </p><p>But Jon was a merman. He could be anywhere. Hopefully he was anywhere near. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to do it in the sea.&rdquo;</p><p>The smirk on Ramsay&rsquo;s face brightened and in one smooth movement he pulled his shirt over his head. Looking at his bare chest almost made her throw up and once more she stared at the waves crashing on the beach. </p><p>She took one more deep breath and then she took off her thin summer dress. She didn&rsquo;t like how Ramsay&rsquo;s eyes scanned her almost naked body. She didn&rsquo;t like the tip of his tongue licking his lips while his glance rested on her bra. She most of all didn&rsquo;t like the sweaty hands he placed on her hips, his thumbs resting on the insides of her thighs. </p><p>&ldquo;Relax, Sansa Stark.&rdquo; If his touch was meant to be comforting it failed hopelessly. &ldquo;Just try to enjoy it. I certainly will.&rdquo; He pressed his lips on hers and for a moment Sansa was unable to move or kiss him back. But that didn&rsquo;t seem to bother Ramsay at all. </p><p>The few seconds that passed seemed to last days, but eventually he stepped back and pulled down his pants which gave Sansa the chance to rush into the sea to wash her lips with salted water.</p><p>&ldquo;Good&hellip;&rdquo; Ramsay wrapped his arms around her and Sansa felt a strange and unwelcome pressure in her back. &ldquo;You already made yourself wet.&rdquo; His hand shove down her stomach into her briefs and Sansa closed her eyes firmly. </p><p>Her lips whispered an endless prayer, but tears were stinging in her eyes when Ramsay&rsquo;s hand slid between her legs. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Her eyes flashed open again when she heard her name and when she saw Jon&rsquo;s wet black curls only a few inches away from her she gathered all the courage she had left. </p><p>An unpleasant tingle rolled down her arm when her elbow crashed into Ramsay&rsquo;s ribcage, but his hand was gone, his arms were gone and when she turned around she saw how dark purple tentacles curled around his wrists and ankles to keep him down in the water.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this the girl you were talking about, Jon Targaryen?&rdquo; </p><p>A shiver rolled down Sansa&rsquo;s back, but Jon appeared next to her and nodded firmly.</p><p>He kept his distance.

Like Jon is Aegons third child, Dany is Aerys third child, Arya is Ned\u2019s third child, and Tyrion is Tywins third child. There seems to be so much importance on the characters who were the third kid. Maybe not Arya as much since she\u2019s the only one whose mother didn\u2019t die in childbirth with her but she\u2019s still so important to the story line that it makes me wonder.",
        "answer": "<p>Oh, definitely. The third child is one that does not inherit the title, nor is ever the heir at any point (until the firstborn has a child of their own). Like Benjen Stark or Loras Tyrell, the third child has to seek their own glory by their own merits, otherwise they fall into the shadows of their elder siblings. In short, the third child isn\u2019t remarkable or particularly remembered unless they take the initiative to make something of themselves. </p><p>Which is exactly what Jon, Dany, Arya and Tyrion are all about. Jon is a special case, given he never knew his siblings, but it very much applies to him re: Robb and even hypothetically with Aegon who would have been the Crown Prince - not Jon himself. </p><p>It reinforces the idea of them being outcasts or destined to never surpass their siblings - but in fact, they\u2019ve all defied expectations. </p><p>Regarding Arya\u2019s mother not dying in childbirth - true, that\u2019s a marked difference from the rest. But every parallel doesn\u2019t need to be exactly alike. In the same way that Tyrion doesn\u2019t have a beast of his own, or Bran isn\u2019t a third child, or Dany doesn\u2019t warg the way Jon, Arya or Bran do, it\u2019s about what such a parallel offers to the characters themselves. </p><p>Arya\u2019s mother did not die in childbirth, but she still grew up feeling insecure about her mother\u2019s affections. She still ends up motherless, a lost child, desperately wishing for her family. Not unlike the rest, really. </p><p>Regardless of the specifics of their situation, I think it ultimately comes down to the fact , Jon, Arya, Dany, Tyrion - and Bran - started from a position in the shadows and are emerging quickly to the top. The unexpected heroes, if you will. </p>",
