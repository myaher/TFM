It\u2019s just not something I ever thought about, I guess.\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh my god!

That is not something you wanna hear.\u201d Sam tucks his lips in, biting down on them, holding back laughter. \u201cWell, from the sounds of it, your boy Cupid isn\u2019t packing an extended tip arrow.\u201d He pushes back against the door.</p><p>Bucky gives off the most devious smile, and tries his best not to lose it. A minute later&hellip;</p><p>\u201cThe Patriot.\u201d Sam whispers</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve looks at Sam </p><p>\u201cYour name. I figured it would be something Patriotic, or some shit.\u201d Sam focuses back in on the door.</p><p>\u201cI thought that too. Like something stupid, like&hellip; Freedom, or&hellip; The Iron Flagpole, The General. Oh, or Uncle Sam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude\u2026 not cool.\u201d Sam glares back at Bucky, and Bucky just laughs.</p><p>\u201cI went with the Bald Eagle.\u201d Nat is met with nods of approval.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Bucky holds out his fist for her to bump.</p><p><i>\u201cDid you touch this one yet?\u201d</i> The female voice is finally heard again.</p><p><i>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s so soft. This one too.\u201d</i> He says.</p><p> You can hear Clint start to giggle. </p><p><i>\u201cHey, you\u2019re getting me all wet!\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cSteve, are you blushing?\u201d Bucky pushes his friend almost knocking him off his feet.</p><p>\u201cThis is getting weird you guys.\u201d He answers.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is getting awesome.\u201d Sam rubs his hands together, and high fives Nat.</p><p><i>\u201cDo you want to hold him?\u201d</i> Clint curiously asks his mystery women.</p><p><i>\u201cYes! Oh wow! He\u2019s heavier than I thought he would be. I just want to snuggle him, and rub him on my face!\u201d</i> Bucky and Sam twist their faces back. </p><p>\u201cWho is in there with him?\u201d Steve pulls a face and throws his arm out, trying to determine who it could be.</p><p>They go in to listen one more time, but stop as Bucky breaks down in a complete fit of laughter. </p><p>In between breaths and tears, he manages to squeak out..\u201dThe bald eagle\u2026\u201d then doubles over, grabbing his stomach, as Sam starts to laugh with him.</p><p>\u201cYou never thought of that?\u201d Nat sneers back at them, trying to keep her composure.</p><p>\u201cI hate you guys.\u201d Steve leans back crossing his arms, the slight pink on his face traveling to the tips of his ears.</p><p><i>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</i> Squinting your eyes, you lean towards the door, when you hear the distinct sound of laughter.</p><p><i>\u201cYeah, I hear it too. Do you think someone knows we\u2019re in here?\u201d</i> Clint grabs a box and starts to fill it.</p><p><i>\u201cIf Tony finds us he&rsquo;ll freak out.\u201d</i> You gather your belongings, throwing your shirt on top real quick. You grab the handle of the door, slowly inching your way out, trying your hardest to remain undetected.</p><p>Everyone gasps and straightens up immediately, as if all six of you had just been caught stealing.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Natasha yells out, pointing her finger in your direction.</p><p>\u201cClint! You&hellip;and Y/N! No way!\u201d Sam\u2019s eyes burst open, making you start to panic, the sudden attention on you making the room feel like it was a furnace.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here&hellip;in the hallway&hellip;next to \u00a0the door?\u201d You question as Clint shimmies behind you, trying his best to hide the box, glancing both ways down the hallway wondering who else might pop up.</p><p>\u201cWhat were YOU doing&hellip;in the hallway closet&hellip;behind the door?\u201d Sam crosses his arms, a shit eating grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You and Clint both answer in unison.</p><p>\u201cNothing huh? Is that code for \u201csex.\u201d Nat makes quotes with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, we weren\u2019t&hellip;You guys thought someone was having sex in here? Oh my god, you were listening to us \u2018having sex\u2019 \u00a0in there!\u201d You quote your fingers back to her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She yells back, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cYes. We totally were.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBucky!\u201d Nat backhands his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat! She obviously caught us!\u201d He backhands her back.</p><p>Steve watches Clint nervously fidgeting behind you still.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box, Clint?\u201d Tilting his head to the side, Steve zeros in on the item in Clint\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You firmly. \u201cAnd we were not having sex.\u201d</p><p>The six of you all halt for a moment, watching each other, trying to read one another\u2019s thoughts. Clearly, you could all see that a big move was about to be made, but by who first was the real question.</p><p>The tiny edge of Steve\u2019s lip lifts ever so slightly. \u201cGrab them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoo!\u201d Bucky grabs a hold of you waist, flipping you over his shoulder. Beating against his back, you scream for Clint to run, but it\u2019s too late. \u00a0He had already been placed in a chokehold by Nat, and Steve and Sam were already forcing the box from his hands.</p><p>\u201cBe careful! You\u2019re going to hurt them!\u201d Biting Bucky\u2019s butt, he yelps out and just about drops you to the ground.</p><p>Scrambling to the box, you open it and take stock, making sure there was no damage to it\u2019s contents. </p><p>\u201cAre you guys okay?\u201d You reach in and tuck something small into your lap.</p><p>Nat gasps, her face lighting up, as she points to the box.</p><p><b>\u201cLook at all those puppies!\u201d </b></p><p>\u201cShhhh! Tony will hear you! If he finds out he would kill us! You know he hates pets in here!\u201d </p><p>Bucky and Sam drop down to the floor, each grabbing a small pup as they attempt to climb out the box, searching for attention.</p><p>\u201cWhere did they all come from?\u201d Steve reaches in and takes out two, giggling like a school boy as they burrow up into his neck.</p><p>\u201cI found them outside in the box. There was a note attached asking if we could take care of them, since we take care of everyone else. The vets closed for the night, so we were going to take care of them until tomorrow. \u00a0We were just trying to keep them hidden from Tony.\u201d Clint continued to explain why they were in the closet, but suddenly stopped when the sound on Tony\u2019s voice could be heard approaching.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s coming, shit, everyone hide a puppy!\u201d The sight of the some of the toughest avengers on Earth, lifting their shirts to hide small little furballs, or stuffing them in their jackets and pants was a sight to see. It was all you could do to not start laughing, but for the sake of the little ones, you had to remain calm.</p><p>Tony points to all of you suspiciously, waving his finger around at all of you. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Three of you answer at the same time. Well that didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He stares at Steve, knowing if any of you were to break, it would be him to spill the beans.</p><p>\u201cWe..\u201d Steve starts but is cut off by Nat.</p><p>\u201cWe caught Y/N and Clint fooling around in the closet.\u201d Your eyes bug out, before closing tightly, wishing the floor would devour you whole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Tony leans his head to the side, a grin overtaking his face.</p><p>\u201cY/N and Clint, in the closet, doing it.\u201d Bucky repeats. He shivers a bit as a puppy runs his cold nose along his side.</p><p>Sam notices, and tries to cover it up. \u201cYup, we felt the same way when we caught them, shivers down my spine, dude.\u201d</p><p>Tony watches the two of you, than finally makes eye contact with Clint. \u201cGood for you Birdman, I didn\u2019t know you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is happening here, you think to yourself. You wanted to be annoyed, but you were to busy trying to shift the small animal around in your shirt. You sigh in relief as Tony begins to back up, happy that his line of questioning had ceased, but then start to panic when he leans in closer to you.</p><p>\u201cIs that&hellip;why are you covered in what looks to be&hellip;animal hair?\u201d He looks up and down your shirt, wondering why you looked like you had rolled on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOh..I..um\u2026\u201d Shit, you were busted. There was nothing you could say to\u2026</p><p>\u201cFeathers.\u201d Clint sputters out. </p><p>\u201cFeathers\u2026?\u201d Collectively you all watch as Clint tries to come up with a quick cover story.</p><p>\u201cYeah, feathers\u2026 cause you know, I\u2019m a hawk and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026I\u2026 where are you going with this?\u201d Yes, indeed, where is he going with this? You stare at him with confused wonder, and for a split second, he gives you the quickest of side glances. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough to tell you that something bad was coming.</p><p>\u201cShe likes it when we roll play.\u201d The look on your face was priceless. What did he just say?</p><p>\u201cRole play?\u201d Tony questioned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, role play\u2026 you know&hellip;I\u2019m the hawk, and she\u2019s the&hellip;um&hellip;field mouse.\u201d Clint shakes his head, squinting his eyes in embarrassment . He knew that he would be feeling a world of pain later, and he knew it would be you delivering it. Lifting your hands up, you let out a small squeak before hiding behind them. </p><p>\u201cSee. She gets really into it, the noises and all. Likes it when I chase her through the woods out back.\u201d Clint nods his head your way.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop talking.\u201d Begging him to stop, he apologizes as you continue to hide your face, mortified to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony waves his hand in front of you all, and shakes his head violently from side to side. \u201cNope, I don\u2019t need to hear anymore.\u201d \u00a0Turning quickly he hurriedly walks down the hall towards the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Clint!\u201d You begin to smack his arms aggressively while watching Sam and Bucky double over. </p><p>\u201cIt was the first thing that came to my mind! I\u2019m sorry! Hey, it worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get these guys out of here before he comes back again.\u201d You all start to gather your pups from the various hiding places in your clothes. You all get in the elevator to head to your room, and breath a sigh of relief when the doors finally shut. </p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, Nat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all the names in the world that you could think of, what do you think Steve would pick to call his Penis?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNatasha!\u201d Steve throws his head back against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. \u2018Old Glory,\u2019 of course.\u201d Sam and Bucky begin to laugh hysterically, before you add in, \u201cand he would call his junk \u2018Stars and Stripes.\u2019 Why?\u201d You have never seen three grown men cry so hard from laughter before.</p><p>\u201cI hate you guys.\u201d </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <strike>@fuckmeupsebastian</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnTFn521ZEBJro32JhPBZGw\">@awkward-sydney</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <strike>@samstuffworld @10robins</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a></p>",

That is not something you wanna hear.\u201d Sam tucks his lips in, biting down on them, holding back laughter. \u201cWell, from the sounds of it, your boy Cupid isn\u2019t packing an extended tip arrow.\u201d He pushes back against the door.</p><p>Bucky gives off the most devious smile, and tries his best not to lose it. A minute later\u2026</p><p>\u201cThe Patriot.\u201d Sam whispers</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve looks at Sam </p><p>\u201cYour name. I figured it would be something Patriotic, or some shit.\u201d Sam focuses back in on the door.</p><p>\u201cI thought that too.

Oh, or Uncle Sam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude\u2026 not cool.\u201d Sam glares back at Bucky, and Bucky just laughs.</p><p>\u201cI went with the Bald Eagle.\u201d Nat is met with nods of approval.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Bucky holds out his fist for her to bump.</p><p><i>\u201cDid you touch this one yet?\u201d</i> The female voice is finally heard again.</p><p><i>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s so soft.

Oh wow! He\u2019s heavier than I thought he would be. I just want to snuggle him, and rub him on my face!\u201d</i> Bucky and Sam twist their faces back. </p><p>\u201cWho is in there with him?\u201d Steve pulls a face and throws his arm out, trying to determine who it could be.</p><p>They go in to listen one more time, but stop as Bucky breaks down in a complete fit of laughter. </p><p>In between breaths and tears, he manages to squeak out..\u201dThe bald eagle\u2026\u201d then doubles over, grabbing his stomach, as Sam starts to laugh with him.</p><p>\u201cYou never thought of that?\u201d Nat sneers back at them, trying to keep her composure.</p><p>\u201cI hate you guys.\u201d Steve leans back crossing his arms, the slight pink on his face traveling to the tips of his ears.</p><p><i>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</i> Squinting your eyes, you lean towards the door, when you hear the distinct sound of laughter.</p><p><i>\u201cYeah, I hear it too. Do you think someone knows we\u2019re in here?\u201d</i> Clint grabs a box and starts to fill it.</p><p><i>\u201cIf Tony finds us he\u2019ll freak out.\u201d</i> You gather your belongings, throwing your shirt on top real quick. You grab the handle of the door, slowly inching your way out, trying your hardest to remain undetected.</p><p>Everyone gasps and straightens up immediately, as if all six of you had just been caught stealing.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Natasha yells out, pointing her finger in your direction.</p><p>\u201cClint! You\u2026and Y/N! No way!\u201d Sam\u2019s eyes burst open, making you start to panic, the sudden attention on you making the room feel like it was a furnace.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here\u2026in the hallway\u2026next to \u00a0the door?\u201d You question as Clint shimmies behind you, trying his best to hide the box, glancing both ways down the hallway wondering who else might pop up.</p><p>\u201cWhat were YOU doing\u2026in the hallway closet\u2026behind the door?\u201d Sam crosses his arms, a shit eating grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You and Clint both answer in unison.</p><p>\u201cNothing huh? Is that code for \u201csex.\u201d Nat makes quotes with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, we weren\u2019t\u2026You guys thought someone was having sex in here? Oh my god, you were listening to us \u2018having sex\u2019 \u00a0in there!\u201d You quote your fingers back to her.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She yells back, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cYes. We totally were.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBucky!\u201d Nat backhands his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat! She obviously caught us!\u201d He backhands her back.</p><p>Steve watches Clint nervously fidgeting behind you still.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box, Clint?\u201d Tilting his head to the side, Steve zeros in on the item in Clint\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You firmly. \u201cAnd we were not having sex.\u201d</p><p>The six of you all halt for a moment, watching each other, trying to read one another\u2019s thoughts. Clearly, you could all see that a big move was about to be made, but by who first was the real question.</p><p>The tiny edge of Steve\u2019s lip lifts ever so slightly. \u201cGrab them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoo!\u201d Bucky grabs a hold of you waist, flipping you over his shoulder. Beating against his back, you scream for Clint to run, but it\u2019s too late. \u00a0He had already been placed in a chokehold by Nat, and Steve and Sam were already forcing the box from his hands.</p><p>\u201cBe careful! You\u2019re going to hurt them!\u201d Biting Bucky\u2019s butt, he yelps out and just about drops you to the ground.</p><p>Scrambling to the box, you open it and take stock, making sure there was no damage to it\u2019s contents. </p><p>\u201cAre you guys okay?\u201d You reach in and tuck something small into your lap.</p><p>Nat gasps, her face lighting up, as she points to the box.</p><p><b>\u201cLook at all those puppies!\u201d </b></p><p>\u201cShhhh! Tony will hear you! If he finds out he would kill us! You know he hates pets in here!\u201d </p><p>Bucky and Sam drop down to the floor, each grabbing a small pup as they attempt to climb out the box, searching for attention.</p><p>\u201cWhere did they all come from?\u201d Steve reaches in and takes out two, giggling like a school boy as they burrow up into his neck.</p><p>\u201cI found them outside in the box. There was a note attached asking if we could take care of them, since we take care of everyone else. The vets closed for the night, so we were going to take care of them until tomorrow. \u00a0We were just trying to keep them hidden from Tony.\u201d Clint continued to explain why they were in the closet, but suddenly stopped when the sound on Tony\u2019s voice could be heard approaching.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s coming, shit, everyone hide a puppy!\u201d The sight of the some of the toughest avengers on Earth, lifting their shirts to hide small little furballs, or stuffing them in their jackets and pants was a sight to see. It was all you could do to not start laughing, but for the sake of the little ones, you had to remain calm.</p><p>Tony points to all of you suspiciously, waving his finger around at all of you. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Three of you answer at the same time. Well that didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He stares at Steve, knowing if any of you were to break, it would be him to spill the beans.</p><p>\u201cWe..\u201d Steve starts but is cut off by Nat.</p><p>\u201cWe caught Y/N and Clint fooling around in the closet.\u201d Your eyes bug out, before closing tightly, wishing the floor would devour you whole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Tony leans his head to the side, a grin overtaking his face.</p><p>\u201cY/N and Clint, in the closet, doing it.\u201d Bucky repeats. He shivers a bit as a puppy runs his cold nose along his side.</p><p>Sam notices, and tries to cover it up. \u201cYup, we felt the same way when we caught them, shivers down my spine, dude.\u201d</p><p>Tony watches the two of you, than finally makes eye contact with Clint. \u201cGood for you Birdman, I didn\u2019t know you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is happening here, you think to yourself. You wanted to be annoyed, but you were to busy trying to shift the small animal around in your shirt. You sigh in relief as Tony begins to back up, happy that his line of questioning had ceased, but then start to panic when he leans in closer to you.</p><p>\u201cIs that\u2026why are you covered in what looks to be\u2026animal hair?\u201d He looks up and down your shirt, wondering why you looked like you had rolled on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOh..I..um\u2026\u201d Shit, you were busted. There was nothing you could say to\u2026</p><p>\u201cFeathers.\u201d Clint sputters out. </p><p>\u201cFeathers\u2026?\u201d Collectively you all watch as Clint tries to come up with a quick cover story.</p><p>\u201cYeah, feathers\u2026 cause you know, I\u2019m a hawk and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026I\u2026 where are you going with this?\u201d Yes, indeed, where is he going with this? You stare at him with confused wonder, and for a split second, he gives you the quickest of side glances. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough to tell you that something bad was coming.</p><p>\u201cShe likes it when we roll play.\u201d The look on your face was priceless. What did he just say?</p><p>\u201cRole play?\u201d Tony questioned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, role play\u2026 you know\u2026I\u2019m the hawk, and she\u2019s the\u2026um\u2026field mouse.\u201d Clint shakes his head, squinting his eyes in embarrassment . He knew that he would be feeling a world of pain later, and he knew it would be you delivering it. Lifting your hands up, you let out a small squeak before hiding behind them. </p><p>\u201cSee. She gets really into it, the noises and all. Likes it when I chase her through the woods out back.\u201d Clint nods his head your way.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop talking.\u201d Begging him to stop, he apologizes as you continue to hide your face, mortified to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony waves his hand in front of you all, and shakes his head violently from side to side. \u201cNope, I don\u2019t need to hear anymore.\u201d \u00a0Turning quickly he hurriedly walks down the hall towards the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Clint!\u201d You begin to smack his arms aggressively while watching Sam and Bucky double over. </p><p>\u201cIt was the first thing that came to my mind! I\u2019m sorry! Hey, it worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get these guys out of here before he comes back again.\u201d You all start to gather your pups from the various hiding places in your clothes. You all get in the elevator to head to your room, and breath a sigh of relief when the doors finally shut. </p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, Nat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all the names in the world that you could think of, what do you think Steve would pick to call his Penis?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNatasha!\u201d Steve throws his head back against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. \u2018Old Glory,\u2019 of course.\u201d Sam and Bucky begin to laugh hysterically, before you add in, \u201cand he would call his junk \u2018Stars and Stripes.\u2019 Why?\u201d You have never seen three grown men cry so hard from laughter before.</p><p>\u201cI hate you guys.\u201d </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <strike>@fuckmeupsebastian</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnTFn521ZEBJro32JhPBZGw\">@awkward-sydney</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <strike>@samstuffworld @10robins</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a></p></p>",

Is that code for \u201csex.\u201d Nat makes quotes with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, we weren\u2019t\u2026You guys thought someone was having sex in here?

She obviously caught us!\u201d He backhands her back.</p><p>Steve watches Clint nervously fidgeting behind you still.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box, Clint?\u201d Tilting his head to the side, Steve zeros in on the item in Clint\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You firmly. \u201cAnd we were not having sex.\u201d</p><p>The six of you all halt for a moment, watching each other, trying to read one another\u2019s thoughts. Clearly, you could all see that a big move was about to be made, but by who first was the real question.</p><p>The tiny edge of Steve\u2019s lip lifts ever so slightly. \u201cGrab them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoo!\u201d Bucky grabs a hold of you waist, flipping you over his shoulder. Beating against his back, you scream for Clint to run, but it\u2019s too late. \u00a0He had already been placed in a chokehold by Nat, and Steve and Sam were already forcing the box from his hands.</p><p>\u201cBe careful! You\u2019re going to hurt them!\u201d Biting Bucky\u2019s butt, he yelps out and just about drops you to the ground.</p><p>Scrambling to the box, you open it and take stock, making sure there was no damage to it\u2019s contents. </p><p>\u201cAre you guys okay?\u201d You reach in and tuck something small into your lap.</p><p>Nat gasps, her face lighting up, as she points to the box.</p><p><b>\u201cLook at all those puppies!\u201d </b></p><p>\u201cShhhh! Tony will hear you! If he finds out he would kill us! You know he hates pets in here!\u201d </p><p>Bucky and Sam drop down to the floor, each grabbing a small pup as they attempt to climb out the box, searching for attention.</p><p>\u201cWhere did they all come from?\u201d Steve reaches in and takes out two, giggling like a school boy as they burrow up into his neck.</p><p>\u201cI found them outside in the box. There was a note attached asking if we could take care of them, since we take care of everyone else. The vets closed for the night, so we were going to take care of them until tomorrow. \u00a0We were just trying to keep them hidden from Tony.\u201d Clint continued to explain why they were in the closet, but suddenly stopped when the sound on Tony\u2019s voice could be heard approaching.</p><p>\u201cTony\u2019s coming, shit, everyone hide a puppy!\u201d The sight of the some of the toughest avengers on Earth, lifting their shirts to hide small little furballs, or stuffing them in their jackets and pants was a sight to see. It was all you could do to not start laughing, but for the sake of the little ones, you had to remain calm.</p><p>Tony points to all of you suspiciously, waving his finger around at all of you. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Three of you answer at the same time. Well that didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He stares at Steve, knowing if any of you were to break, it would be him to spill the beans.</p><p>\u201cWe..\u201d Steve starts but is cut off by Nat.</p><p>\u201cWe caught Y/N and Clint fooling around in the closet.\u201d Your eyes bug out, before closing tightly, wishing the floor would devour you whole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Tony leans his head to the side, a grin overtaking his face.</p><p>\u201cY/N and Clint, in the closet, doing it.\u201d Bucky repeats. He shivers a bit as a puppy runs his cold nose along his side.</p><p>Sam notices, and tries to cover it up. \u201cYup, we felt the same way when we caught them, shivers down my spine, dude.\u201d</p><p>Tony watches the two of you, than finally makes eye contact with Clint. \u201cGood for you Birdman, I didn\u2019t know you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is happening here, you think to yourself. You wanted to be annoyed, but you were to busy trying to shift the small animal around in your shirt. You sigh in relief as Tony begins to back up, happy that his line of questioning had ceased, but then start to panic when he leans in closer to you.</p><p>\u201cIs that\u2026why are you covered in what looks to be\u2026animal hair?\u201d He looks up and down your shirt, wondering why you looked like you had rolled on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOh..I..um\u2026\u201d Shit, you were busted. There was nothing you could say to\u2026</p><p>\u201cFeathers.\u201d Clint sputters out. </p><p>\u201cFeathers\u2026?\u201d Collectively you all watch as Clint tries to come up with a quick cover story.</p><p>\u201cYeah, feathers\u2026 cause you know, I\u2019m a hawk and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026I\u2026 where are you going with this?\u201d Yes, indeed, where is he going with this? You stare at him with confused wonder, and for a split second, he gives you the quickest of side glances. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough to tell you that something bad was coming.</p><p>\u201cShe likes it when we roll play.\u201d The look on your face was priceless. What did he just say?</p><p>\u201cRole play?\u201d Tony questioned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, role play\u2026 you know\u2026I\u2019m the hawk, and she\u2019s the\u2026um\u2026field mouse.\u201d Clint shakes his head, squinting his eyes in embarrassment . He knew that he would be feeling a world of pain later, and he knew it would be you delivering it. Lifting your hands up, you let out a small squeak before hiding behind them. </p><p>\u201cSee. She gets really into it, the noises and all. Likes it when I chase her through the woods out back.\u201d Clint nods his head your way.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop talking.\u201d Begging him to stop, he apologizes as you continue to hide your face, mortified to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony waves his hand in front of you all, and shakes his head violently from side to side. \u201cNope, I don\u2019t need to hear anymore.\u201d \u00a0Turning quickly he hurriedly walks down the hall towards the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Clint!\u201d You begin to smack his arms aggressively while watching Sam and Bucky double over. </p><p>\u201cIt was the first thing that came to my mind! I\u2019m sorry! Hey, it worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get these guys out of here before he comes back again.\u201d You all start to gather your pups from the various hiding places in your clothes. You all get in the elevator to head to your room, and breath a sigh of relief when the doors finally shut. </p><p>\u201cHey, Y/N?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, Nat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf all the names in the world that you could think of, what do you think Steve would pick to call his Penis?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNatasha!\u201d Steve throws his head back against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy. \u2018Old Glory,\u2019 of course.\u201d Sam and Bucky begin to laugh hysterically, before you add in, \u201cand he would call his junk \u2018Stars and Stripes.\u2019 Why?\u201d You have never seen three grown men cry so hard from laughter before.</p><p>\u201cI hate you guys.\u201d </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <strike>@fuckmeupsebastian</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnTFn521ZEBJro32JhPBZGw\">@awkward-sydney</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <strike>@samstuffworld @10robins</strike> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a></p></p>",

Oh, or Uncle Sam!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude&hellip; not cool.&rdquo; Sam glares back at Bucky, and Bucky just laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;I went with the Bald Eagle.&rdquo; Nat is met with nods of approval.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice.&rdquo; Bucky holds out his fist for her to bump.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Did you touch this one yet?&rdquo;</i> The female voice is finally heard again.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s so soft. This one too.&rdquo;</i> He says.</p><p> You can hear Clint start to giggle. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re getting me all wet!&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Steve, are you blushing?&rdquo; Bucky pushes his friend almost knocking him off his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;This is getting weird you guys.&rdquo; He answers.</p><p>&ldquo;No, this is getting awesome.&rdquo; Sam rubs his hands together, and high fives Nat.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you want to hold him?&rdquo;</i> Clint curiously asks his mystery women.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes! Oh wow! He&rsquo;s heavier than I thought he would be. I just want to snuggle him, and rub him on my face!&rdquo;</i> Bucky and Sam twist their faces back. </p><p>&ldquo;Who is in there with him?&rdquo; Steve pulls a face and throws his arm out, trying to determine who it could be.</p><p>They go in to listen one more time, but stop as Bucky breaks down in a complete fit of laughter. </p><p>In between breaths and tears, he manages to squeak out..&rdquo;The bald eagle&hellip;&rdquo; then doubles over, grabbing his stomach, as Sam starts to laugh with him.</p><p>&ldquo;You never thought of that?&rdquo; Nat sneers back at them, trying to keep her composure.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you guys.&rdquo; Steve leans back crossing his arms, the slight pink on his face traveling to the tips of his ears.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</i> Squinting your eyes, you lean towards the door, when you hear the distinct sound of laughter.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, I hear it too. Do you think someone knows we&rsquo;re in here?&rdquo;</i> Clint grabs a box and starts to fill it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;If Tony finds us he&rsquo;ll freak out.&rdquo;</i> You gather your belongings, throwing your shirt on top real quick. You grab the handle of the door, slowly inching your way out, trying your hardest to remain undetected.</p><p>Everyone gasps and straightens up immediately, as if all six of you had just been caught stealing.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Natasha yells out, pointing her finger in your direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Clint! You&hellip;and Y/N! No way!&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s eyes burst open, making you start to panic, the sudden attention on you making the room feel like it was a furnace.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you guys doing here&hellip;in the hallway&hellip;next to &nbsp;the door?&rdquo; You question as Clint shimmies behind you, trying his best to hide the box, glancing both ways down the hallway wondering who else might pop up.</p><p>&ldquo;What were YOU doing&hellip;in the hallway closet&hellip;behind the door?&rdquo; Sam crosses his arms, a shit eating grin on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You and Clint both answer in unison.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing huh? Is that code for &ldquo;sex.&rdquo; Nat makes quotes with her fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;What? No, we weren&rsquo;t&hellip;You guys thought someone was having sex in here? Oh my god, you were listening to us &lsquo;having sex&rsquo; &nbsp;in there!&rdquo; You quote your fingers back to her.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; She yells back, folding her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. We totally were.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky!&rdquo; Nat backhands his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;What! She obviously caught us!&rdquo; He backhands her back.</p><p>Steve watches Clint nervously fidgeting behind you still.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the box, Clint?&rdquo; Tilting his head to the side, Steve zeros in on the item in Clint&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You firmly. &ldquo;And we were not having sex.&rdquo;</p><p>The six of you all halt for a moment, watching each other, trying to read one another&rsquo;s thoughts. Clearly, you could all see that a big move was about to be made, but by who first was the real question.</p><p>The tiny edge of Steve&rsquo;s lip lifts ever so slightly. &ldquo;Grab them!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Noo!&rdquo; Bucky grabs a hold of you waist, flipping you over his shoulder. Beating against his back, you scream for Clint to run, but it&rsquo;s too late. &nbsp;He had already been placed in a chokehold by Nat, and Steve and Sam were already forcing the box from his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Be careful! You&rsquo;re going to hurt them!&rdquo; Biting Bucky&rsquo;s butt, he yelps out and just about drops you to the ground.</p><p>Scrambling to the box, you open it and take stock, making sure there was no damage to it&rsquo;s contents. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you guys okay?&rdquo; You reach in and tuck something small into your lap.</p><p>Nat gasps, her face lighting up, as she points to the box.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Look at all those puppies!&rdquo; </b></p><p>&ldquo;Shhhh! Tony will hear you! If he finds out he would kill us! You know he hates pets in here!&rdquo; </p><p>Bucky and Sam drop down to the floor, each grabbing a small pup as they attempt to climb out the box, searching for attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Where did they all come from?&rdquo; Steve reaches in and takes out two, giggling like a school boy as they burrow up into his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I found them outside in the box. There was a note attached asking if we could take care of them, since we take care of everyone else. The vets closed for the night, so we were going to take care of them until tomorrow. &nbsp;We were just trying to keep them hidden from Tony.&rdquo; Clint continued to explain why they were in the closet, but suddenly stopped when the sound on Tony&rsquo;s voice could be heard approaching.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s coming, shit, everyone hide a puppy!&rdquo; The sight of the some of the toughest avengers on Earth, lifting their shirts to hide small little furballs, or stuffing them in their jackets and pants was a sight to see. It was all you could do to not start laughing, but for the sake of the little ones, you had to remain calm.</p><p>Tony points to all of you suspiciously, waving his finger around at all of you. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s&hellip; what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Three of you answer at the same time. Well that didn&rsquo;t help.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; He stares at Steve, knowing if any of you were to break, it would be him to spill the beans.</p><p>&ldquo;We..&rdquo; Steve starts but is cut off by Nat.</p><p>&ldquo;We caught Y/N and Clint fooling around in the closet.&rdquo; Your eyes bug out, before closing tightly, wishing the floor would devour you whole.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what?&rdquo; Tony leans his head to the side, a grin overtaking his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N and Clint, in the closet, doing it.&rdquo; Bucky repeats. He shivers a bit as a puppy runs his cold nose along his side.</p><p>Sam notices, and tries to cover it up. &ldquo;Yup, we felt the same way when we caught them, shivers down my spine, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony watches the two of you, than finally makes eye contact with Clint. &ldquo;Good for you Birdman, I didn&rsquo;t know you had it in you.&rdquo;</p><p>What the hell is happening here, you think to yourself. You wanted to be annoyed, but you were to busy trying to shift the small animal around in your shirt. You sigh in relief as Tony begins to back up, happy that his line of questioning had ceased, but then start to panic when he leans in closer to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that&hellip;why are you covered in what looks to be&hellip;animal hair?&rdquo; He looks up and down your shirt, wondering why you looked like you had rolled on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh..I..um&hellip;&rdquo; Shit, you were busted. There was nothing you could say to&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Feathers.&rdquo; Clint sputters out. </p><p>&ldquo;Feathers&hellip;?&rdquo; Collectively you all watch as Clint tries to come up with a quick cover story.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, feathers&hellip; cause you know, I&rsquo;m a hawk and all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;I&hellip; where are you going with this?&rdquo; Yes, indeed, where is he going with this? You stare at him with confused wonder, and for a split second, he gives you the quickest of side glances. It wasn&rsquo;t much, but it was enough to tell you that something bad was coming.</p><p>&ldquo;She likes it when we roll play.&rdquo; The look on your face was priceless. What did he just say?</p><p>&ldquo;Role play?&rdquo; Tony questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, role play&hellip; you know&hellip;I&rsquo;m the hawk, and she&rsquo;s the&hellip;um&hellip;field mouse.&rdquo; Clint shakes his head, squinting his eyes in embarrassment . He knew that he would be feeling a world of pain later, and he knew it would be you delivering it. Lifting your hands up, you let out a small squeak before hiding behind them. </p><p>&ldquo;See. She gets really into it, the noises and all. Likes it when I chase her through the woods out back.&rdquo; Clint nods his head your way.</p><p>&ldquo;Please stop talking.&rdquo; Begging him to stop, he apologizes as you continue to hide your face, mortified to look at Tony.</p><p>Tony waves his hand in front of you all, and shakes his head violently from side to side. &ldquo;Nope, I don&rsquo;t need to hear anymore.&rdquo; &nbsp;Turning quickly he hurriedly walks down the hall towards the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding me? Clint!&rdquo; You begin to smack his arms aggressively while watching Sam and Bucky double over. </p><p>&ldquo;It was the first thing that came to my mind! I&rsquo;m sorry! Hey, it worked, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get these guys out of here before he comes back again.&rdquo; You all start to gather your pups from the various hiding places in your clothes. You all get in the elevator to head to your room, and breath a sigh of relief when the doors finally shut. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Y/N?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Nat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of all the names in the world that you could think of, what do you think Steve would pick to call his Penis?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Natasha!&rdquo; Steve throws his head back against the wall. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy. &lsquo;Old Glory,&rsquo; of course.&rdquo; Sam and Bucky begin to laugh hysterically, before you add in, &ldquo;and he would call his junk &lsquo;Stars and Stripes.&rsquo; Why?&rdquo; You have never seen three grown men cry so hard from laughter before.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you guys.&rdquo; </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYhgUx-San7m8wiSmlNPOaA\">@prettyyoungtragedy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTx48xjxYH65VPL48I4B2Rg\">@thoughtsofdarc</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/makUAw34SPL0O83aJi__67w\">@kazu-is-reading</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1db3U5m6y3atLYfhFBeDRQ\">@glitterkunoichi</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVoRn0Y6fH_fqa5qDidsWSQ\">@schilj79</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <strike>@fuckmeupsebastian</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnTFn521ZEBJro32JhPBZGw\">@awkward-sydney</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLeKiHZE_-fQJFmjHGHoeXg\">@just-add-butter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvdBDnM3eWuNSTqMFUZaaQ\">@bojabee</a> <strike>@samstuffworld @10robins</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp757tS4u6WsQaOYvTJ33bQ\">@lordemjay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhrLShlhTMnbLO7NkHF_GBg\">@i-regret-this-already</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzErfd9XK1c0OilMfavsmaQ\">@kapsikle</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD67QyhL4mhTUE02TrrftTw\">@tbetz0341</a></p></p>",
