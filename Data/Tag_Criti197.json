My entirely-too-long break down of pretty much everything that came out of Liam O\u2019Brien\u2019s mouth pertaining to the blood sacrifice/pact at the end of last week\u2019s episode.\u00a0</p><p>Before we begin, I want to be clear that this is an analysis specifically about Caleb&rsquo;s perspective during the scene in question. My thoughts about the scene as a whole, and Fjord&rsquo;s role in it&ndash;and how that influences Caleb&rsquo;s part in it&ndash;are more complicated (and I&rsquo;ve already written about it a bit). Caleb&rsquo;s motivations in this scene were obviously unhealthy, but I don&rsquo;t think that Fjord was without agency or fault in this exchange, and I think that Fjord had equally complicated motivations as Caleb (if not necessarily as consciously manipulative).\n</p><p>\nThis is pretty much just a paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of what Liam said on Talks Tuesday night, so I&rsquo;ll be quoting chunks of it and then dumping my thoughts all over it. (And it&rsquo;s below a cut because of my classic verbosity).\u00a0</p><p><i>And away we go!\n</i></p><!-- more --><blockquote><p>\n\n    <b>Liam:</b> Caleb, in that moment, could see this man, who he spent all this time with start to be tempted by power, which was always a thought that Caleb had. But he saw Fjord\u2013<b>not just try to figure out his father figure, or his past, or what the situation is.</b> He saw this guy who seemed like [&hellip;] he was an upright guy [&hellip;]  be tempted by power.\n</p></blockquote><p>\nFirst and foremost, I find it interesting that to Caleb there is a distinction between Fjord&rsquo;s power-seeking when it&rsquo;s tied to learning more about himself or his past, and Fjord seeking (and being tempted by) power for power&rsquo;s sake. It&rsquo;s an understandable distinction to make, but it also reveals something about how Caleb views/understands power, and its acquisition. When Fjord was  seeking power and knowledge as a way to learn more about his past, there was a specific, bounded purpose in his pursuit. That was, and is, a motivation that Caleb can relate to&ndash;after all, his own pursuit of power is largely motivated by him wanting to save his family from his own terrible decision. I think that Fjord&rsquo;s desire for power has always been at least partially self-interested (or: Fjord&rsquo;s interested in power because he spent so much of his life feeling powerless). But between Caleb projecting his understanding of power onto Fjord, and the fact that Caleb thinks of Fjord as a fundamentally &ldquo;upright guy,&rdquo; he hasn&rsquo;t really seen the darker parts of Fjord until now.  \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n     And in that moment\u2013[Caleb]&rsquo;s very much like Trent, the man who molded him\u2013<b>saw for a split second in time a hunger in this guy&rsquo;s eyes, and thought that it could be molded or bent for his use.</b>\n</p></blockquote><p>\nA man who has put no bounds on his pursuit of power&ndash;who does not know where his desire and temptation begins and ends&ndash;is a person who is both dangerous and vulnerable in Caleb&rsquo;s view. Caleb deeply and intimately knows what it is to be Dangerous and Vulnerable. I&rsquo;ve spent the past week turning the word &ldquo;manipulative&rdquo; around in my head. So much, that I went to look at its denotative definition.\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    <i>adjective: <b>manipulative</b></i>\n</p><p><i>1. characterized by unscrupulous control of a situation or person.</i></p></blockquote><p>\nI don&rsquo;t disagree that Caleb (thought he) was manipulating Fjord in this moment, but I don&rsquo;t think it was the favor that was the &ldquo;unscrupulous&rdquo; part of the manipulation. After all, while Fjord may be a man of his word, he is also  on the whole (in Caleb&rsquo;s mind), a Good Man. Caleb knows that it&rsquo;s entirely likely that if he asks Fjord for the wrong thing he could refuse to go along  with it, regardless of any pact or promise, (as Liam said,\u00a0\u201c<i>You know, Fjord could murder Caleb later\u201d</i>). Caleb\u2019s conscious goal in manipulating Fjord\u2019s curiosity to his advantage was to obtain\u00a0a favor, but the real danger of the moment was that by indulging Fjord, Caleb pushed him that much closer to the edge that Fjord has been steadily approaching over the course of this arc. Caleb doesn&rsquo;t realize that the Mighty Nein genuinely care for him and want to support him, so while Caleb intended to \u201cwin\u201d a favor from the Fjord,\u00a0the real effect of Caleb&rsquo;s decision to join Fjord in the sacrifice had more to do with pushing Fjord closer to being the type of person who might honor a morally questionable request.\n</p><p>\nThe transactional lens through which Caleb tends to view his relationships is usually passive. It&rsquo;s an instinctual derivation of his training from Trent&ndash;&ldquo;the man who molded him.&rdquo; This moment with Fjord is one of the first times since The Iron Shepherd\u2019s arc that he&rsquo;s actively viewed a party member through the same lens Trent viewed the Blumenthal kids. Instead of Caleb\u2019s typical &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how friends work,&rdquo; brand of\u00a0\u201cmanipulation,\u201d\u00a0this scene had Caleb think, &ldquo;I am actively exploiting a weakness to my own ends.&rdquo; (With a healthy serving of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how friends work&rdquo; on the side.) Caleb\u2019s transactional understanding of interpersonal relationships has been a consistent piece of his characterization. And because it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s been trained into his subconscious&ndash;and Caleb has consistently resisted any desire to move towards recovery&ndash;it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s hard to break out of. But up until the most recent episode, the person who was most harmed by this outlook was Caleb himself. \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    He thought, &ldquo;I could take a risk here, that will probably be okay. I could probably do this and not end the world, or anything. <b>We could pull short of whatever this is going to be</b>, and <b>I could have a new understanding with Fjord</b>, and I could probably pull a favor out of this.&rdquo; I thought that in advance, like &ldquo;[Fjord] wants to <i>do</i> something here, and <b>I want to facilitate it, and have him be beholden to me for it</b>.&rdquo; \n</p></blockquote><p>\nWhile Caleb went into the blood sacrifice with the intention and expectation that they wouldn&rsquo;t see it through to its end, in the moment he ultimately leaves the decision in Fjord&rsquo;s hands. When Caleb is given opportunity and reason to draw the exchange to a close, he instead pushes Fjord in order to see how far he&rsquo;s willing to go in his pursuit. If the exchange had ended there, with Caleb deciding they ought to leave well enough alone, he would have still walked away with his favor. But I don&rsquo;t know that they would have come to the same &ldquo;understanding.&rdquo; And to Caleb&rsquo;s mind, it&rsquo;s possible that Fjord hadn&rsquo;t yet reached a point where he was &ldquo;beholden&rdquo; to Caleb. That final acquisition to Fjord might have been enough to tip the scales.</p><p>\nCaleb&rsquo;s relationship with Fjord is distinct from the individual relationships he has with the rest of the group. They are more alike than I think the both of them realize. To the extent that they <i>do </i>realize it though, their similar  approaches to solving problems has always been their most common point of connection. The extent to which Caleb and Fjord clearly <i>don&rsquo;t</i> understand each other has also been one of their biggest points of contention. While I don&rsquo;t think most of the party (outside of Nott) necessarily <i>trusts</i> Caleb, I think at this point most of them believe that he&rsquo;s dedicated to the group. I think Fjord has come closer to reaching that point over the course of this arc, but I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d quite arrived there yet. Fjord has been burned  and betrayed by people often enough that he likely places more stock in actions than he does in words. Caleb helping to save him from the Iron Shepherds, and putting himself on the line in Dark Tow are really the biggest examples of Caleb <i>acting</i> in support of Fjord/the group. Even if Caleb doesn&rsquo;t fully understand Fjord&rsquo;s stance on loyalty, I think he at least understands that he values action over words. It&rsquo;s a risk to put the call of whether or not to continue the ritual in Fjord&rsquo;s hands, but that very abdication of control increases the chance that Fjord will recognize Caleb&rsquo;s sacrifice (both literally and metaphorically) as something that warrants or constitutes a debt between them. Putting the decision in Fjord&rsquo;s hands also lets Caleb poke and prod at the edges of Fjord&rsquo;s interest in power. \n</p><p>\nBut even within the depths of Caleb&rsquo;s manipulative inner monologue, a bit of sentimentality slips through. There are many things that Caleb wanted out of the exchange, most of them seemingly one-sided. But Liam lists &ldquo;an understanding <i>with</i> Fjord,&rdquo; as a distinct motivating factor. Maybe I&rsquo;m reading too much into that particular word choice (but hey, that&rsquo;s what I do), but I think it&rsquo;s important that Caleb was looking for an understanding <i>with</i> Fjord, and not an understanding <i>of</i> or <i>from</i> Fjord. (Whereas I think Fjord was seeking an understanding <i>of</i> Caleb, just as much as he was interested in finding an understanding <i>with</i> Caleb.) I think that Caleb often feels like he&rsquo;s on his back foot with Fjord&ndash;he hasn&rsquo;t found the awkward harmony and equilibrium with him that he has with the other members of the group. They understand each other on a pragmatic level, and they both honestly like and care for the other, but there hasn\u2019t really been mutual understanding there. And sadly, despite Fjord&rsquo;s declaration that &ldquo;we understand each other,&rdquo; at the end, I don&rsquo;t think they found it in this scene, either. For Fjord, that understanding was bound up in the symbolism of their joined hands. But, &ldquo;Caleb saw no significance to cut palms touching, other than the fact that it was obvious that Fjord did.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s actually quite astounding that Caleb understands enough about Fjord to know that making a deliberate and definitive display of solidarity would work toward winning Fjord&rsquo;s loyalty (or: would make him <i>beholden </i>to him), without understanding the personal and emotional significance that Fjord brings to his loyalties. I do think that Caleb and Fjord both came out of the pact with a greater understanding <i>of</i> each other, and how far the other is willing to go in the pursuit of power and its &ldquo;reward.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t think they found a common point of understanding between each other.\n</p><p>\nI am also struck by the fact that this scene marks one of the first times Caleb has experienced remorse since he killed his parents.\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    [A]fter that moment, [&hellip;] <i>Caleb </i>was <i>disgusted</i> with himself [&hellip;] He was a product of his schooling in that moment. And part of him was like &ldquo;<i>Yes,&rdquo;</i> and the rest of him went, &ldquo;You fucking piece of filth. Look at you.&rdquo;\n</p></blockquote><p>\nI think that there&rsquo;s a lot that Caleb <i>regrets</i>, or that he doesn&rsquo;t feel great about, but in general Caleb tends not to be particularly reflective about his darker impulses/instincts. Caleb defaults to &ldquo;manipulating&rdquo; the people around him, because he legitimately doesn&rsquo;t know how to have interpersonal relationships that don&rsquo;t involve some element of duplicity or calculated reciprocity. Similarly, he&rsquo;s willing and able to be intimidating and coldly calculating when he needs to be, because those are skills and modes of operating that have become his normal. The nature of his transactional relationship towards other characters has always been predicated on relatively small, but steady demonstrations of support and power. The blood sacrifice/pact marks the first time that Caleb has chosen to manipulate his relationship with a member of the Nein via the explicit exploitation of their vulnerabilities. It&rsquo;s the first time Caleb has actively approached a situation through Trent&rsquo;s <i>perspective</i> as opposed to solving problems with Trent&rsquo;s <i>methods</i>.\n</p><p>\nAt the moment, Caleb is at a crossroads. On the one hand, the intense amount of regret, disgust and self-loathing he experienced right after making the pact with Fjord&ndash;coupled with Jester&rsquo;s disappointment&ndash;may trigger an honest reckoning with himself. It might not be an immediate shift, but if some combination of Beau, Nott, and Jester are able to get him to actually be honest about his motivations and feelings, there is some potential for healthy progress. On the other hand, Caleb may (and, honestly, probably will) interpret this scene as a confirmation of his deepest suspicions that he is a &ldquo;garbage person.&rdquo; He might close off and refuse to engage with the others. Caleb often seems to embody a, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a terrible person, may as well embrace it,&rdquo; mindset where it comes to morals. If his sense of self becomes <i>more</i> negative after this moment, it may result in him making increasingly dubious and harmful decisions. I really have no clue what road lies ahead of this, only that it&rsquo;s probably going to be <i>really fucking painful</i>.\n</p><hr><p>\nSome additional thoughts that aren\u2019t as directly related to everything above:</p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n    Liam: </b>Ultimately he knew he would get to a point where\u2013There&rsquo;s things that he wants to do, and there&rsquo;s multiple things that he <i>might </i>do. He&rsquo;s not quite sure what he wants to do, but he has a couple of branches of things that he could do.\n</p></blockquote><p>\nI really want Caleb to actually talk to the group about these branching plans, because while what I ultimately want for Caleb is for him to move on, I&rsquo;m also really curious about whether the group might be able to help him find a solution that poses relatively little risk to reality, saves his parents, <i>and\u00a0</i>allows him to maintain the relationship with the group. I don&rsquo;t think that specific outcome is particularly likely. But regardless, I think the fact that Caleb&rsquo;s goals are still relatively malleable means that there&rsquo;s a chance to alter them. \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    None of those are going to happen unless he takes risks, and earns big. So there&rsquo;s no reason to play it safe, after a certain point. <i>Calculated risks</i>, something that Caleb and Fjord have talked about for a long time. And if he <i>dies</i> trying to do the things he&rsquo;s attempting here? That&rsquo;s okay with him. He is trying to undo something disgusting and terrible. He&rsquo;s willing to put his life on the line to make it happen. So he doesn&rsquo;t do anything willy-nilly\u2013he thinks, &ldquo;Well this could be the end of you, <i>but</i> it could get you this much closer to\u2013 [\u2026] this could pull you closer to the thing you want.&rdquo;\n</p></blockquote><p>\nHey, fuck me, Caleb will literally throw his life away on the slim chance he might be able to bring his parents back instead of trying to build a new one with these people who already and also love him.\u00a0</p>",

My entirely-too-long break down of pretty much everything that came out of Liam O\u2019Brien\u2019s mouth pertaining to the blood sacrifice/pact at the end of last week\u2019s episode.\u00a0</p><p>Before we begin, I want to be clear that this is an analysis specifically about Caleb\u2019s perspective during the scene in question. My thoughts about the scene as a whole, and Fjord\u2019s role in it\u2013and how that influences Caleb\u2019s part in it\u2013are more complicated (and I\u2019ve already written about it a bit).

(And it\u2019s below a cut because of my classic verbosity).\u00a0</p><p><i>And away we go!\n</i></p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p>\n\n    <b>Liam:</b> Caleb, in that moment, could see this man, who he spent all this time with start to be tempted by power, which was always a thought that Caleb had. But he saw Fjord\u2013<b>not just try to figure out his father figure, or his past, or what the situation is.</b> He saw this guy who seemed like [\u2026] he was an upright guy [\u2026]  be tempted by power.\n</p></blockquote><p>\nFirst and foremost, I find it interesting that to Caleb there is a distinction between Fjord\u2019s power-seeking when it\u2019s tied to learning more about himself or his past, and Fjord seeking (and being tempted by) power for power\u2019s sake. It\u2019s an understandable distinction to make, but it also reveals something about how Caleb views/understands power, and its acquisition. When Fjord was  seeking power and knowledge as a way to learn more about his past, there was a specific, bounded purpose in his pursuit. That was, and is, a motivation that Caleb can relate to\u2013after all, his own pursuit of power is largely motivated by him wanting to save his family from his own terrible decision. I think that Fjord\u2019s desire for power has always been at least partially self-interested (or: Fjord\u2019s interested in power because he spent so much of his life feeling powerless). But between Caleb projecting his understanding of power onto Fjord, and the fact that Caleb thinks of Fjord as a fundamentally \u201cupright guy,\u201d he hasn\u2019t really seen the darker parts of Fjord until now.  \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n     And in that moment\u2013[Caleb]\u2019s very much like Trent, the man who molded him\u2013<b>saw for a split second in time a hunger in this guy\u2019s eyes, and thought that it could be molded or bent for his use.</b>\n</p></blockquote><p>\nA man who has put no bounds on his pursuit of power\u2013who does not know where his desire and temptation begins and ends\u2013is a person who is both dangerous and vulnerable in Caleb\u2019s view. Caleb deeply and intimately knows what it is to be Dangerous and Vulnerable. I\u2019ve spent the past week turning the word \u201cmanipulative\u201d around in my head. So much, that I went to look at its denotative definition.\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    <i>adjective: <b>manipulative</b></i>\n</p><p><i>1. characterized by unscrupulous control of a situation or person.</i></p></blockquote><p>\nI don\u2019t disagree that Caleb (thought he) was manipulating Fjord in this moment, but I don\u2019t think it was the favor that was the \u201cunscrupulous\u201d part of the manipulation. After all, while Fjord may be a man of his word, he is also  on the whole (in Caleb\u2019s mind), a Good Man. Caleb knows that it\u2019s entirely likely that if he asks Fjord for the wrong thing he could refuse to go along  with it, regardless of any pact or promise, (as Liam said,\u00a0\u201c<i>You know, Fjord could murder Caleb later\u201d</i>). Caleb\u2019s conscious goal in manipulating Fjord\u2019s curiosity to his advantage was to obtain\u00a0a favor, but the real danger of the moment was that by indulging Fjord, Caleb pushed him that much closer to the edge that Fjord has been steadily approaching over the course of this arc. Caleb doesn\u2019t realize that the Mighty Nein genuinely care for him and want to support him, so while Caleb intended to \u201cwin\u201d a favor from the Fjord,\u00a0the real effect of Caleb\u2019s decision to join Fjord in the sacrifice had more to do with pushing Fjord closer to being the type of person who might honor a morally questionable request.\n</p><p>\nThe transactional lens through which Caleb tends to view his relationships is usually passive. It\u2019s an instinctual derivation of his training from Trent\u2013\u201cthe man who molded him.\u201d This moment with Fjord is one of the first times since The Iron Shepherd\u2019s arc that he\u2019s actively viewed a party member through the same lens Trent viewed the Blumenthal kids. Instead of Caleb\u2019s typical \u201cI don\u2019t understand how friends work,\u201d brand of\u00a0\u201cmanipulation,\u201d\u00a0this scene had Caleb think, \u201cI am actively exploiting a weakness to my own ends.\u201d (With a healthy serving of \u201cI don\u2019t know how friends work\u201d on the side.) Caleb\u2019s transactional understanding of interpersonal relationships has been a consistent piece of his characterization. And because it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s been trained into his subconscious\u2013and Caleb has consistently resisted any desire to move towards recovery\u2013it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s hard to break out of. But up until the most recent episode, the person who was most harmed by this outlook was Caleb himself. \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    He thought, \u201cI could take a risk here, that will probably be okay. I could probably do this and not end the world, or anything. <b>We could pull short of whatever this is going to be</b>, and <b>I could have a new understanding with Fjord</b>, and I could probably pull a favor out of this.\u201d I thought that in advance, like \u201c[Fjord] wants to <i>do</i> something here, and <b>I want to facilitate it, and have him be beholden to me for it</b>.\u201d \n</p></blockquote><p>\nWhile Caleb went into the blood sacrifice with the intention and expectation that they wouldn\u2019t see it through to its end, in the moment he ultimately leaves the decision in Fjord\u2019s hands. When Caleb is given opportunity and reason to draw the exchange to a close, he instead pushes Fjord in order to see how far he\u2019s willing to go in his pursuit. If the exchange had ended there, with Caleb deciding they ought to leave well enough alone, he would have still walked away with his favor. But I don\u2019t know that they would have come to the same \u201cunderstanding.\u201d And to Caleb\u2019s mind, it\u2019s possible that Fjord hadn\u2019t yet reached a point where he was \u201cbeholden\u201d to Caleb. That final acquisition to Fjord might have been enough to tip the scales.</p><p>\nCaleb\u2019s relationship with Fjord is distinct from the individual relationships he has with the rest of the group. They are more alike than I think the both of them realize. To the extent that they <i>do </i>realize it though, their similar  approaches to solving problems has always been their most common point of connection. The extent to which Caleb and Fjord clearly <i>don\u2019t</i> understand each other has also been one of their biggest points of contention.

Caleb\u2019s motivations in this scene were obviously unhealthy, but I don\u2019t think that Fjord was without agency or fault in this exchange, and I think that Fjord had equally complicated motivations as Caleb (if not necessarily as consciously manipulative).\n</p><p>\nThis is pretty much just a paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of what Liam said on Talks Tuesday night, so I\u2019ll be quoting chunks of it and then dumping my thoughts all over it. (And it\u2019s below a cut because of my classic verbosity).\u00a0</p><p><i>And away we go!\n</i></p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p>\n\n    <b>Liam:</b> Caleb, in that moment, could see this man, who he spent all this time with start to be tempted by power, which was always a thought that Caleb had. But he saw Fjord\u2013<b>not just try to figure out his father figure, or his past, or what the situation is.</b> He saw this guy who seemed like [\u2026] he was an upright guy [\u2026]  be tempted by power.\n</p></blockquote><p>\nFirst and foremost, I find it interesting that to Caleb there is a distinction between Fjord\u2019s power-seeking when it\u2019s tied to learning more about himself or his past, and Fjord seeking (and being tempted by) power for power\u2019s sake. It\u2019s an understandable distinction to make, but it also reveals something about how Caleb views/understands power, and its acquisition. When Fjord was  seeking power and knowledge as a way to learn more about his past, there was a specific, bounded purpose in his pursuit. That was, and is, a motivation that Caleb can relate to\u2013after all, his own pursuit of power is largely motivated by him wanting to save his family from his own terrible decision. I think that Fjord\u2019s desire for power has always been at least partially self-interested (or: Fjord\u2019s interested in power because he spent so much of his life feeling powerless). But between Caleb projecting his understanding of power onto Fjord, and the fact that Caleb thinks of Fjord as a fundamentally \u201cupright guy,\u201d he hasn\u2019t really seen the darker parts of Fjord until now.  \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n     And in that moment\u2013[Caleb]\u2019s very much like Trent, the man who molded him\u2013<b>saw for a split second in time a hunger in this guy\u2019s eyes, and thought that it could be molded or bent for his use.</b>\n</p></blockquote><p>\nA man who has put no bounds on his pursuit of power\u2013who does not know where his desire and temptation begins and ends\u2013is a person who is both dangerous and vulnerable in Caleb\u2019s view. Caleb deeply and intimately knows what it is to be Dangerous and Vulnerable. I\u2019ve spent the past week turning the word \u201cmanipulative\u201d around in my head. So much, that I went to look at its denotative definition.\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    <i>adjective: <b>manipulative</b></i>\n</p><p><i>1. characterized by unscrupulous control of a situation or person.</i></p></blockquote><p>\nI don\u2019t disagree that Caleb (thought he) was manipulating Fjord in this moment, but I don\u2019t think it was the favor that was the \u201cunscrupulous\u201d part of the manipulation. After all, while Fjord may be a man of his word, he is also  on the whole (in Caleb\u2019s mind), a Good Man. Caleb knows that it\u2019s entirely likely that if he asks Fjord for the wrong thing he could refuse to go along  with it, regardless of any pact or promise, (as Liam said,\u00a0\u201c<i>You know, Fjord could murder Caleb later\u201d</i>). Caleb\u2019s conscious goal in manipulating Fjord\u2019s curiosity to his advantage was to obtain\u00a0a favor, but the real danger of the moment was that by indulging Fjord, Caleb pushed him that much closer to the edge that Fjord has been steadily approaching over the course of this arc. Caleb doesn\u2019t realize that the Mighty Nein genuinely care for him and want to support him, so while Caleb intended to \u201cwin\u201d a favor from the Fjord,\u00a0the real effect of Caleb\u2019s decision to join Fjord in the sacrifice had more to do with pushing Fjord closer to being the type of person who might honor a morally questionable request.\n</p><p>\nThe transactional lens through which Caleb tends to view his relationships is usually passive. It\u2019s an instinctual derivation of his training from Trent\u2013\u201cthe man who molded him.\u201d This moment with Fjord is one of the first times since The Iron Shepherd\u2019s arc that he\u2019s actively viewed a party member through the same lens Trent viewed the Blumenthal kids. Instead of Caleb\u2019s typical \u201cI don\u2019t understand how friends work,\u201d brand of\u00a0\u201cmanipulation,\u201d\u00a0this scene had Caleb think, \u201cI am actively exploiting a weakness to my own ends.\u201d (With a healthy serving of \u201cI don\u2019t know how friends work\u201d on the side.) Caleb\u2019s transactional understanding of interpersonal relationships has been a consistent piece of his characterization. And because it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s been trained into his subconscious\u2013and Caleb has consistently resisted any desire to move towards recovery\u2013it\u2019s a perspective that\u2019s hard to break out of. But up until the most recent episode, the person who was most harmed by this outlook was Caleb himself. \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    He thought, \u201cI could take a risk here, that will probably be okay. I could probably do this and not end the world, or anything. <b>We could pull short of whatever this is going to be</b>, and <b>I could have a new understanding with Fjord</b>, and I could probably pull a favor out of this.\u201d I thought that in advance, like \u201c[Fjord] wants to <i>do</i> something here, and <b>I want to facilitate it, and have him be beholden to me for it</b>.\u201d \n</p></blockquote><p>\nWhile Caleb went into the blood sacrifice with the intention and expectation that they wouldn\u2019t see it through to its end, in the moment he ultimately leaves the decision in Fjord\u2019s hands. When Caleb is given opportunity and reason to draw the exchange to a close, he instead pushes Fjord in order to see how far he\u2019s willing to go in his pursuit. If the exchange had ended there, with Caleb deciding they ought to leave well enough alone, he would have still walked away with his favor. But I don\u2019t know that they would have come to the same \u201cunderstanding.\u201d And to Caleb\u2019s mind, it\u2019s possible that Fjord hadn\u2019t yet reached a point where he was \u201cbeholden\u201d to Caleb. That final acquisition to Fjord might have been enough to tip the scales.</p><p>\nCaleb\u2019s relationship with Fjord is distinct from the individual relationships he has with the rest of the group. They are more alike than I think the both of them realize. To the extent that they <i>do </i>realize it though, their similar  approaches to solving problems has always been their most common point of connection. The extent to which Caleb and Fjord clearly <i>don\u2019t</i> understand each other has also been one of their biggest points of contention. While I don\u2019t think most of the party (outside of Nott) necessarily <i>trusts</i> Caleb, I think at this point most of them believe that he\u2019s dedicated to the group. I think Fjord has come closer to reaching that point over the course of this arc, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d quite arrived there yet. Fjord has been burned  and betrayed by people often enough that he likely places more stock in actions than he does in words. Caleb helping to save him from the Iron Shepherds, and putting himself on the line in Dark Tow are really the biggest examples of Caleb <i>acting</i> in support of Fjord/the group. Even if Caleb doesn\u2019t fully understand Fjord\u2019s stance on loyalty, I think he at least understands that he values action over words. It\u2019s a risk to put the call of whether or not to continue the ritual in Fjord\u2019s hands, but that very abdication of control increases the chance that Fjord will recognize Caleb\u2019s sacrifice (both literally and metaphorically) as something that warrants or constitutes a debt between them. Putting the decision in Fjord\u2019s hands also lets Caleb poke and prod at the edges of Fjord\u2019s interest in power. \n</p><p>\nBut even within the depths of Caleb\u2019s manipulative inner monologue, a bit of sentimentality slips through. There are many things that Caleb wanted out of the exchange, most of them seemingly one-sided. But Liam lists \u201can understanding <i>with</i> Fjord,\u201d as a distinct motivating factor. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into that particular word choice (but hey, that\u2019s what I do), but I think it\u2019s important that Caleb was looking for an understanding <i>with</i> Fjord, and not an understanding <i>of</i> or <i>from</i> Fjord. (Whereas I think Fjord was seeking an understanding <i>of</i> Caleb, just as much as he was interested in finding an understanding <i>with</i> Caleb.) I think that Caleb often feels like he\u2019s on his back foot with Fjord\u2013he hasn\u2019t found the awkward harmony and equilibrium with him that he has with the other members of the group. They understand each other on a pragmatic level, and they both honestly like and care for the other, but there hasn\u2019t really been mutual understanding there. And sadly, despite Fjord\u2019s declaration that \u201cwe understand each other,\u201d at the end, I don\u2019t think they found it in this scene, either. For Fjord, that understanding was bound up in the symbolism of their joined hands. But, \u201cCaleb saw no significance to cut palms touching, other than the fact that it was obvious that Fjord did.\u201d It\u2019s actually quite astounding that Caleb understands enough about Fjord to know that making a deliberate and definitive display of solidarity would work toward winning Fjord\u2019s loyalty (or: would make him <i>beholden </i>to him), without understanding the personal and emotional significance that Fjord brings to his loyalties. I do think that Caleb and Fjord both came out of the pact with a greater understanding <i>of</i> each other, and how far the other is willing to go in the pursuit of power and its \u201creward.\u201d But I don\u2019t think they found a common point of understanding between each other.\n</p><p>\nI am also struck by the fact that this scene marks one of the first times Caleb has experienced remorse since he killed his parents.\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    [A]fter that moment, [\u2026] <i>Caleb </i>was <i>disgusted</i> with himself [\u2026] He was a product of his schooling in that moment. And part of him was like \u201c<i>Yes,\u201d</i> and the rest of him went, \u201cYou fucking piece of filth. Look at you.\u201d\n</p></blockquote><p>\nI think that there\u2019s a lot that Caleb <i>regrets</i>, or that he doesn\u2019t feel great about, but in general Caleb tends not to be particularly reflective about his darker impulses/instincts. Caleb defaults to \u201cmanipulating\u201d the people around him, because he legitimately doesn\u2019t know how to have interpersonal relationships that don\u2019t involve some element of duplicity or calculated reciprocity. Similarly, he\u2019s willing and able to be intimidating and coldly calculating when he needs to be, because those are skills and modes of operating that have become his normal. The nature of his transactional relationship towards other characters has always been predicated on relatively small, but steady demonstrations of support and power. The blood sacrifice/pact marks the first time that Caleb has chosen to manipulate his relationship with a member of the Nein via the explicit exploitation of their vulnerabilities. It\u2019s the first time Caleb has actively approached a situation through Trent\u2019s <i>perspective</i> as opposed to solving problems with Trent\u2019s <i>methods</i>.\n</p><p>\nAt the moment, Caleb is at a crossroads. On the one hand, the intense amount of regret, disgust and self-loathing he experienced right after making the pact with Fjord\u2013coupled with Jester\u2019s disappointment\u2013may trigger an honest reckoning with himself. It might not be an immediate shift, but if some combination of Beau, Nott, and Jester are able to get him to actually be honest about his motivations and feelings, there is some potential for healthy progress. On the other hand, Caleb may (and, honestly, probably will) interpret this scene as a confirmation of his deepest suspicions that he is a \u201cgarbage person.\u201d He might close off and refuse to engage with the others. Caleb often seems to embody a, \u201cI\u2019m a terrible person, may as well embrace it,\u201d mindset where it comes to morals. If his sense of self becomes <i>more</i> negative after this moment, it may result in him making increasingly dubious and harmful decisions. I really have no clue what road lies ahead of this, only that it\u2019s probably going to be <i>really fucking painful</i>.\n</p><hr><p>\nSome additional thoughts that aren\u2019t as directly related to everything above:</p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n    Liam: </b>Ultimately he knew he would get to a point where\u2013There\u2019s things that he wants to do, and there\u2019s multiple things that he <i>might </i>do. He\u2019s not quite sure what he wants to do, but he has a couple of branches of things that he could do.\n</p></blockquote><p>\nI really want Caleb to actually talk to the group about these branching plans, because while what I ultimately want for Caleb is for him to move on, I\u2019m also really curious about whether the group might be able to help him find a solution that poses relatively little risk to reality, saves his parents, <i>and\u00a0</i>allows him to maintain the relationship with the group. I don\u2019t think that specific outcome is particularly likely. But regardless, I think the fact that Caleb\u2019s goals are still relatively malleable means that there\u2019s a chance to alter them. \n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n    None of those are going to happen unless he takes risks, and earns big. So there\u2019s no reason to play it safe, after a certain point. <i>Calculated risks</i>, something that Caleb and Fjord have talked about for a long time. And if he <i>dies</i> trying to do the things he\u2019s attempting here? That\u2019s okay with him. He is trying to undo something disgusting and terrible. He\u2019s willing to put his life on the line to make it happen. So he doesn\u2019t do anything willy-nilly\u2013he thinks, \u201cWell this could be the end of you, <i>but</i> it could get you this much closer to\u2013 [\u2026] this could pull you closer to the thing you want.\u201d\n</p></blockquote><p>\nHey, fuck me, Caleb will literally throw his life away on the slim chance he might be able to bring his parents back instead of trying to build a new one with these people who already and also love him.\u00a0</p>",

My entirely-too-long break down of pretty much everything that came out of Liam O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s mouth pertaining to the blood sacrifice/pact at the end of last week&rsquo;s episode.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before we begin, I want to be clear that this is an analysis specifically about Caleb&rsquo;s perspective during the scene in question. My thoughts about the scene as a whole, and Fjord&rsquo;s role in it&ndash;and how that influences Caleb&rsquo;s part in it&ndash;are more complicated (and I&rsquo;ve already written about it a bit). Caleb&rsquo;s motivations in this scene were obviously unhealthy, but I don&rsquo;t think that Fjord was without agency or fault in this exchange, and I think that Fjord had equally complicated motivations as Caleb (if not necessarily as consciously manipulative).\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is pretty much just a paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of what Liam said on Talks Tuesday night, so I&rsquo;ll be quoting chunks of it and then dumping my thoughts all over it. (And it&rsquo;s below a cut because of my classic verbosity).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>And away we go!\n</i></p>\n</p>",
