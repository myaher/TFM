        "body": "<p><b>Request:</b><br/></p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://starslazyandcosy.tumblr.com/\">starslazyandcosy</a>:  \u201cCould you write something with Brie having her longtime girlfriend joining her for the Captain marvel/ Avengers Endgame press tour. Like how it goes in the morning, or on the red carpet, when Brie doing interviews or a diner with the whole cast. Also with Y/N not being a celebrity.\u201c</p></blockquote><p><b>Pairing:</b>\u00a0Brie x reader</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Yeah, this was originally not going to be a full fic idea, I was going to stick with headcanons but something happened and I ended up with a full story so&hellip; Also, writing for real people is something I had a lot of difficulty doing, and ended up rewriting quite a lot of this several times, so I really hope it\u2019s okay and that people are \u2018in character\u2019 for at least majority of it. As usual, please enjoy and any feedback is appreciated!</p><p><br/></p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>You woke up to the sound of movement coming from the other side of the room. Opening one eye, you see Brie moving around the room, still dressed in the tank top and shorts she went to bed in the night before. As you roll your body to face her, you let out a groan and she turns to look at you with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re up!\u201d She happily says before having a good look at you, clearly not happy to be awake just yet. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake you, did I?\u201d She speaks with a hushed tone and offers you an apologetic smile as she makes her way back towards the bed.</p><p>The two of you found yourselves in a hotel room in LA, the last of several stops you had made with Brie on the current Avengers: Endgame press tour. You had been in a relationship with Brie for quite a while now, and though you both considered your relationship the endgame (no pun intended), you were still yet to appear publicly together as a couple.</p><p>Unlike Brie, you weren\u2019t a celebrity, so you found the spotlight a little daunting. Brie, being an incredibly introverted and private person, of course completely understood your reservations. She\u2019d always been patient with you and was happy to wait until you were ready, and with the Endgame world premiere happening tonight, you had both talked a lot about you joining Brie.</p><p>Brie sits down on the bed and you turn your head to glance towards the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you even doing awake? It looks like the sun\u2019s just come up.\u201d You look up at Brie and she offers a small shrug before sighing shortly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, jet lag is kicking my ass I think.\u201d She pouts and you can\u2019t help but chuckle at her. \u201cGood thing it\u2019s the last stop of the tour though, huh?\u201d You hum in agreement and watch Brie for a quiet moment. Her eyes scan your face and she sends you a tired grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back to bed?\u201d You mumble as you grab Brie by the hand and try to pull her towards you.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m already up. Might as well just stay up now,\u201d she says but she barely even fights it and a second later lets you pull her back down to lay next to you. \u201cBesides, some of the cast wanted to do brunch to catch up before the premiere tonight.\u201d You playfully roll your eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie, babe. That\u2019s <i>brunch</i>. I\u2019d say we still have at least a couple of hours until then.\u201d You bring your hand up to move a strand of hair from her face, tucking it behind her ear. She hums and moves her body closer to you. Her eyes are watching you, almost studying you, and you tilt your head in question. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, just out of curiosity, you still wanted to come to the premiere with me tonight, right?\u201d She moves her hand to rest on your hip, her fingers playing with the hem of your shirt.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah. I think so.\u201d Brie idly nods at you and you furrow your brow slightly. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Of course I want you to!\u201d She quickly gets out. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I checked my phone when I first woke up and apparently someone took some photos when we got here last night because my fans are kind of talking about us a lot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what do you mean they\u2019re talking about us? What are they saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mainly wondering who you are and if we\u2019re together. I think a couple of them might have found some older photos you\u2019re in, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d you say as you sit up on the bed and make yourself remain calm as you let it sink in that people you don\u2019t know are currently discussing you and Brie\u2019s relationship. Brie sits up too and takes your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cHey, the good news is that everyone seems to like us together.\u201d She shrugs and offers you a small smirk. \u201cWho can blame them, really? We are pretty great together.\u201d You laugh lightly and shake your head.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying, Miss Larson. You still want me to be your date tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be an honour.\u201d Brie leans in and kisses you softly before breaking apart with a grin on her face. \u201cAnd if you think about it, it\u2019s kind of the perfect time. Now that everyone\u2019s seen you, I think it makes sense to just let them all know that we\u2019re together now and get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d you say as move to lay back down on the bed, pulling Brie back down with you.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>You and Brie spent the rest of the morning in bed cuddling before you had to get up in time to meet some of the cast for brunch. You had all agreed to just meet in the hotel restaurant mainly for the sake of everyone\u2019s privacy.</p><p>You and Brie join the table and sit down, you next to Robert and Brie next to Chris Hemsworth. They were both seated next to their own wives who had joined them for the last leg of the press tour. Across from you, Jeremy and Paul sit joking about something together. Scarlett, Karen, Mark and Chris Evans all sit together in conversation.</p><p>Everyone looks up and happily greets the both of you when you sit down. Your relationship up until this point might have been kept from most of the world, but the Avengers cast knew you and Brie were together and fully supported it.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see you\u2019ve finally decided to join us,\u201d Hemsworth immediately shoots at Brie with a smirk before sending you a quick wink in greeting.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, the strongest Avenger obviously needs to arrive fashionably late,\u201d she fires back.</p><p>\u201cHuh, that can\u2019t be right. I arrived on time,\u201d Chris furrows his brow before him and Brie break into laughter.</p><p>Elsa, Chris\u2019 wife, looks at you and rolls her eyes before she chuckles at the playful banter. Chris and Brie\u2019s friendship had become a hot topic during the entire press tour. There were constant discussions over whether they hated each other or whether they genuinely got along. Obviously the two found the arguments hilarious, so the banter probably wasn\u2019t ending any time soon.</p><p>\u201cSo, Kid,\u201d Robert says and you turn your head to look at him. \u201cPress tour\u2019s almost done. Have you enjoyed hanging out with us idiots this whole time?\u201d You laugh and give the group a quick glance.</p><p>\u201cI really have. To be honest, I don\u2019t think there could have been a better group of people to do this with.\u201d Robert nods in agreement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re definitely not terrible people to be around.\u201d By this point Scarlett and Chris Evans are listening in and smiling. \u201cSo, have you decided on tonight yet? Does Brie finally get to bring a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I went on Twitter this morning and saw some fans talking about you guys,\u201d Chris says. \u201cHave you gone public yet?\u201d You feel Brie grab your hand under the table and squeeze it.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we think maybe tonight\u2019s the night. What\u2019s the point in waiting any longer?\u201d Both Chris and Scarlett let out sounds of excitement and the rest of the table are grinning in yours and Brie\u2019s direction.</p><p><br/>\n\u201cYes! I\u2019m so happy for you two!\u201d Scarlett exclaims. \u201cYou finally get to let your guards down and just be a couple!\u201d Others chime in with their own congratulations and words of reassurance. They all know that Brie hasn\u2019t publicly come out yet and so you both have a lot of nerves, but their words do wonders in calming you both down.</p><p>You look to Brie, who already has her eyes on you. She\u2019s wearing a small smile but you know she\u2019s watching you for any hint of discomfort with the conversation, so you return her smile and nod at her. As her smile grows, you have no doubt in your mind that this is the right time.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>The car you and Brie are in comes to a stop. You knew that, being the premiere, this is the first time the cast would all see the movie so they were understandably excited and emotional, but all you could think about was the red carpet you had to deal with first.</p><p>Brie pulls you out of your thoughts when she takes your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cYou okay there, babe?\u201d She asks and she shifts herself closer to you. You nod and let out a bit of a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cYeah I think so. Definitely pretty nervous.\u201d You laugh a little unsurely as you look at Brie. \u201cHow about you? I mean, this is a big deal, right? Are you sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says gently, pulling your hand to her lips and pressing them against it before bringing it back down to rest in her lap. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready for this, I\u2019m ready for this. There\u2019s literally no one else I\u2019d rather do this with than you. You know that, right?\u201d You nod and she pulls you into a hug, pressing a kiss to the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cAlright, now how about we go rock this red carpet?\u201d She playfully raises her eyebrows at you and you laugh at her, a sound that makes her grin widely.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d She nods before she gives the thumbs up to the driver, who had been waiting patiently by the car door while you and Brie talked. He opens the door and Brie gracefully exits the car, turning back to offer her hand to you. You let out a deep breath and accept her hand, letting her help you out of the car.</p><p>You smooth down the front of your dress, a vibrant red one you fell in love with earlier on in the press tour, before you and Brie thank the driver and he takes his leave. Brie is in a blue dress which exposes her back and hugs her body perfectly, and you can\u2019t help but let your eyes wander her frame for a moment.</p><p>From where you stand, the red carpet is slightly out of view, giving Brie and yourself another moment to collect yourselves a bit. Robert and his wife, having just stepped out of their own car, make their way towards you in the direction of the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cSee you ladies out there. You\u2019re gonna kill it, you both look fantastic.\u201d He enthusiastically sends you a thumbs up and then disappears around the corner to enter the red carpet. Immediately the sound of screaming fans can be heard and you shoot Brie an alarmed expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that can be a little intimidating at first.\u201d She laughs and grabs your hand. \u201cBut look at it this way. We\u2019re getting the biggest event out of the way first, so anything else after this will be way less scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna choose to accept that,\u201d you say and she chuckles.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Brie smiles and lets her eyes scan over your body before they meet yours again. \u201cRobert\u2019s right, by the way. You look amazing.\u201d She interlocks your fingers with her own before giving you a reassuring smile. \u201cNow let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d</p><p>You make your way to the carpet and immediately the fans start screaming again. Brie escorts you along and waves at the fans, grinning brightly at them. You notice some fans excitedly pointing towards you, clearly recognising you from photos. Brie lets go of your hand to chat with some fans and take some selfies and you watch her proudly. You can\u2019t help the grin that finds itself on your face when Brie returns to you a couple minutes later and takes your hand again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019ve gotta admit this is kind of cool.\u201d You both laugh, you mainly from nerves, as you look around at all the fans and at some other cast members who have already arrived and are making their own way around the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cOf course this is cool, this is the Avengers we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Brie smiles at you and you both are escorted to where other cast members are already doing interviews. You notice that everyone else\u2019s partners for the most part have joined in on the interviews but you hesitate until Brie nods her head towards the press.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d she says as she makes her way over to the first interviewer. She grips your hand tightly and you have the thought that maybe she needs you with her in this moment. After all, up until now Brie hadn\u2019t publicly come out and it occurs to you that this red carpet is probably as scary for her as it is for you.</p><p>The first couple interviews are pretty dull for lack of a better word, and for the most part it seems like the interviewers are actively trying to ignore you despite Brie\u2019s efforts to include you in the conversations.</p><p>The third interviewer Brie approaches asks her a couple of Endgame focused questions before gesturing towards you with a kind smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd who do you have with you tonight?\u201d Brie quickly glances at you and you squeeze her hand and offer a nervous smile before she looks back to the interviewer.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re actually the first to ask me that. This is actually my girlfriend, (Y/N).\u201d The interviewer immediately lights up.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad to hear that! I\u2019d seen a lot of fans debating over whether you were together or not and I didn\u2019t want to pry, but you both look really happy!\u201d You and Brie share a look and she nods at the interviewer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we really are.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the interviews are all for the most part understandably Endgame focused and Brie has to correct a couple of people who refer to you vaguely as her friend, but by the end of the interviews you and Brie both felt like a huge weight had been lifted from your shoulders.</p><p>You\u2019re ushered further along to take some photos, which you find a bit overwhelming as the flashes of the cameras and the shouts of the photographers take you aback a little. Brie keeps a calm hold of your hand before letting go and moving to hold your waist, pulling you closer to her for some photos.</p><p>By now most of the cast had arrived and so the photographers request some photos with just the cast, so you and the other plus ones move to the side. Elsa comes to stand next to you as you both watch the cast posing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing really great for your first event,\u201d she says to you and you smile as you thank her. \u201cI\u2019m happy that both of you seem so happy.\u201d You go to reply but before you can, you hear loud shouts of Brie\u2019s name coming from a group of fans towards the end of the red carpet. She waves over to them but walks towards you first.</p><p>\u201cThis is going well, right?\u201d She asks teasingly before quickly kissing you on the cheek and offering a cheeky grin as she makes her way back to the fans. You feel your cheeks turn pink with a blush. Elsa chuckles and nudges you with her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou two make the rest of us look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, as if anyone could make you and Chris look bad,\u201d you reply and Elsa laughs as you and the rest of the plus ones are ushered to the end of the carpet to wait for your dates.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>After Brie and the cast have finished interacting with the fans, you all head inside for the movie screening. The cast go up on stage for a short Q&amp;A of sorts and then return to their seats to watch to film. You and Brie hold hands throughout the movie, constantly smiling at each other at the realisation that you can act like a regular couple in public now, as much as Brie\u2019s celebrity status would let you anyway.</p><p>When the movies finishes, the cast briefly head back to the stage to discuss what an emotional rollercoaster the movie was. Eventually, everyone slowly files out, the cast taking some time to excitedly talk about the film together for a while before deciding to head back to the hotel for the unofficial afterparty Robert had planned. Technically most of the cast lived around LA, you and Brie included, and didn\u2019t need to stay in the hotel, but Marvel insisted and none of you were complaining at the fancy hotel they decided to put you in.</p><p>The cast had planned a more official party at Robert\u2019s house the next day, so tonight\u2019s afterparty was a lot more low key than you expected. Not long after heading back to the hotel, you find yourself sitting on the bed in your hotel room checking your phone while Brie undresses and puts on her sleepwear.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like we\u2019re already trending,\u201d you tell her. \u201cOh my god, how did they find me on Instagram so fast?!\u201d Brie laughs and comes over to join you on the bed, sitting next to you.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. This is what happens when the world finally gets to meet my amazing girlfriend.\u201d You nudge her shoulder affectionately and laugh.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I forget how sappy you can be.\u201d Brie rolls her eyes at you and nudges you back. \u201cAt least now I can finally brag about Brie Larson wanting me.\u201d Brie laughs and brings you in for a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s right, baby. I want you and only you.\u201d</p>",

Opening one eye, you see Brie moving around the room, still dressed in the tank top and shorts she went to bed in the night before. As you roll your body to face her, you let out a groan and she turns to look at you with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re up!\u201d She happily says before having a good look at you, clearly not happy to be awake just yet. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake you, did I?\u201d She speaks with a hushed tone and offers you an apologetic smile as she makes her way back towards the bed.</p><p>The two of you found yourselves in a hotel room in LA, the last of several stops you had made with Brie on the current Avengers: Endgame press tour. You had been in a relationship with Brie for quite a while now, and though you both considered your relationship the endgame (no pun intended), you were still yet to appear publicly together as a couple.</p><p>Unlike Brie, you weren\u2019t a celebrity, so you found the spotlight a little daunting. Brie, being an incredibly introverted and private person, of course completely understood your reservations. She\u2019d always been patient with you and was happy to wait until you were ready, and with the Endgame world premiere happening tonight, you had both talked a lot about you joining Brie.</p><p>Brie sits down on the bed and you turn your head to glance towards the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you even doing awake? It looks like the sun\u2019s just come up.\u201d You look up at Brie and she offers a small shrug before sighing shortly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, jet lag is kicking my ass I think.\u201d She pouts and you can\u2019t help but chuckle at her. \u201cGood thing it\u2019s the last stop of the tour though, huh?\u201d You hum in agreement and watch Brie for a quiet moment. Her eyes scan your face and she sends you a tired grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back to bed?\u201d You mumble as you grab Brie by the hand and try to pull her towards you.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m already up. Might as well just stay up now,\u201d she says but she barely even fights it and a second later lets you pull her back down to lay next to you. \u201cBesides, some of the cast wanted to do brunch to catch up before the premiere tonight.\u201d You playfully roll your eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie, babe. That\u2019s <i>brunch</i>. I\u2019d say we still have at least a couple of hours until then.\u201d You bring your hand up to move a strand of hair from her face, tucking it behind her ear. She hums and moves her body closer to you. Her eyes are watching you, almost studying you, and you tilt your head in question. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, just out of curiosity, you still wanted to come to the premiere with me tonight, right?\u201d She moves her hand to rest on your hip, her fingers playing with the hem of your shirt.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah. I think so.\u201d Brie idly nods at you and you furrow your brow slightly. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Of course I want you to!\u201d She quickly gets out. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I checked my phone when I first woke up and apparently someone took some photos when we got here last night because my fans are kind of talking about us a lot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what do you mean they\u2019re talking about us? What are they saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mainly wondering who you are and if we\u2019re together. I think a couple of them might have found some older photos you\u2019re in, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d you say as you sit up on the bed and make yourself remain calm as you let it sink in that people you don\u2019t know are currently discussing you and Brie\u2019s relationship. Brie sits up too and takes your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cHey, the good news is that everyone seems to like us together.\u201d She shrugs and offers you a small smirk. \u201cWho can blame them, really? We are pretty great together.\u201d You laugh lightly and shake your head.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying, Miss Larson. You still want me to be your date tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be an honour.\u201d Brie leans in and kisses you softly before breaking apart with a grin on her face. \u201cAnd if you think about it, it\u2019s kind of the perfect time. Now that everyone\u2019s seen you, I think it makes sense to just let them all know that we\u2019re together now and get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d you say as move to lay back down on the bed, pulling Brie back down with you.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You and Brie spent the rest of the morning in bed cuddling before you had to get up in time to meet some of the cast for brunch. You had all agreed to just meet in the hotel restaurant mainly for the sake of everyone\u2019s privacy.</p><p>You and Brie join the table and sit down, you next to Robert and Brie next to Chris Hemsworth. They were both seated next to their own wives who had joined them for the last leg of the press tour. Across from you, Jeremy and Paul sit joking about something together. Scarlett, Karen, Mark and Chris Evans all sit together in conversation.</p><p>Everyone looks up and happily greets the both of you when you sit down. Your relationship up until this point might have been kept from most of the world, but the Avengers cast knew you and Brie were together and fully supported it.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see you\u2019ve finally decided to join us,\u201d Hemsworth immediately shoots at Brie with a smirk before sending you a quick wink in greeting.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, the strongest Avenger obviously needs to arrive fashionably late,\u201d she fires back.</p><p>\u201cHuh, that can\u2019t be right. I arrived on time,\u201d Chris furrows his brow before him and Brie break into laughter.</p><p>Elsa, Chris\u2019 wife, looks at you and rolls her eyes before she chuckles at the playful banter. Chris and Brie\u2019s friendship had become a hot topic during the entire press tour. There were constant discussions over whether they hated each other or whether they genuinely got along. Obviously the two found the arguments hilarious, so the banter probably wasn\u2019t ending any time soon.</p><p>\u201cSo, Kid,\u201d Robert says and you turn your head to look at him. \u201cPress tour\u2019s almost done. Have you enjoyed hanging out with us idiots this whole time?\u201d You laugh and give the group a quick glance.</p><p>\u201cI really have. To be honest, I don\u2019t think there could have been a better group of people to do this with.\u201d Robert nods in agreement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re definitely not terrible people to be around.\u201d By this point Scarlett and Chris Evans are listening in and smiling. \u201cSo, have you decided on tonight yet? Does Brie finally get to bring a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I went on Twitter this morning and saw some fans talking about you guys,\u201d Chris says. \u201cHave you gone public yet?\u201d You feel Brie grab your hand under the table and squeeze it.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we think maybe tonight\u2019s the night. What\u2019s the point in waiting any longer?\u201d Both Chris and Scarlett let out sounds of excitement and the rest of the table are grinning in yours and Brie\u2019s direction.</p><p><br>\n\u201cYes! I\u2019m so happy for you two!\u201d Scarlett exclaims. \u201cYou finally get to let your guards down and just be a couple!\u201d Others chime in with their own congratulations and words of reassurance. They all know that Brie hasn\u2019t publicly come out yet and so you both have a lot of nerves, but their words do wonders in calming you both down.</p><p>You look to Brie, who already has her eyes on you. She\u2019s wearing a small smile but you know she\u2019s watching you for any hint of discomfort with the conversation, so you return her smile and nod at her. As her smile grows, you have no doubt in your mind that this is the right time.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The car you and Brie are in comes to a stop. You knew that, being the premiere, this is the first time the cast would all see the movie so they were understandably excited and emotional, but all you could think about was the red carpet you had to deal with first.</p><p>Brie pulls you out of your thoughts when she takes your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cYou okay there, babe?\u201d She asks and she shifts herself closer to you. You nod and let out a bit of a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cYeah I think so. Definitely pretty nervous.\u201d You laugh a little unsurely as you look at Brie. \u201cHow about you? I mean, this is a big deal, right? Are you sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says gently, pulling your hand to her lips and pressing them against it before bringing it back down to rest in her lap. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready for this, I\u2019m ready for this. There\u2019s literally no one else I\u2019d rather do this with than you. You know that, right?\u201d You nod and she pulls you into a hug, pressing a kiss to the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cAlright, now how about we go rock this red carpet?\u201d She playfully raises her eyebrows at you and you laugh at her, a sound that makes her grin widely.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d She nods before she gives the thumbs up to the driver, who had been waiting patiently by the car door while you and Brie talked. He opens the door and Brie gracefully exits the car, turning back to offer her hand to you. You let out a deep breath and accept her hand, letting her help you out of the car.</p><p>You smooth down the front of your dress, a vibrant red one you fell in love with earlier on in the press tour, before you and Brie thank the driver and he takes his leave. Brie is in a blue dress which exposes her back and hugs her body perfectly, and you can\u2019t help but let your eyes wander her frame for a moment.</p><p>From where you stand, the red carpet is slightly out of view, giving Brie and yourself another moment to collect yourselves a bit. Robert and his wife, having just stepped out of their own car, make their way towards you in the direction of the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cSee you ladies out there. You\u2019re gonna kill it, you both look fantastic.\u201d He enthusiastically sends you a thumbs up and then disappears around the corner to enter the red carpet. Immediately the sound of screaming fans can be heard and you shoot Brie an alarmed expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that can be a little intimidating at first.\u201d She laughs and grabs your hand. \u201cBut look at it this way. We\u2019re getting the biggest event out of the way first, so anything else after this will be way less scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna choose to accept that,\u201d you say and she chuckles.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Brie smiles and lets her eyes scan over your body before they meet yours again. \u201cRobert\u2019s right, by the way. You look amazing.\u201d She interlocks your fingers with her own before giving you a reassuring smile. \u201cNow let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d</p><p>You make your way to the carpet and immediately the fans start screaming again. Brie escorts you along and waves at the fans, grinning brightly at them. You notice some fans excitedly pointing towards you, clearly recognising you from photos. Brie lets go of your hand to chat with some fans and take some selfies and you watch her proudly. You can\u2019t help the grin that finds itself on your face when Brie returns to you a couple minutes later and takes your hand again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019ve gotta admit this is kind of cool.\u201d You both laugh, you mainly from nerves, as you look around at all the fans and at some other cast members who have already arrived and are making their own way around the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cOf course this is cool, this is the Avengers we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Brie smiles at you and you both are escorted to where other cast members are already doing interviews. You notice that everyone else\u2019s partners for the most part have joined in on the interviews but you hesitate until Brie nods her head towards the press.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d she says as she makes her way over to the first interviewer. She grips your hand tightly and you have the thought that maybe she needs you with her in this moment. After all, up until now Brie hadn\u2019t publicly come out and it occurs to you that this red carpet is probably as scary for her as it is for you.</p><p>The first couple interviews are pretty dull for lack of a better word, and for the most part it seems like the interviewers are actively trying to ignore you despite Brie\u2019s efforts to include you in the conversations.</p><p>The third interviewer Brie approaches asks her a couple of Endgame focused questions before gesturing towards you with a kind smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd who do you have with you tonight?\u201d Brie quickly glances at you and you squeeze her hand and offer a nervous smile before she looks back to the interviewer.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re actually the first to ask me that. This is actually my girlfriend, (Y/N).\u201d The interviewer immediately lights up.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad to hear that! I\u2019d seen a lot of fans debating over whether you were together or not and I didn\u2019t want to pry, but you both look really happy!\u201d You and Brie share a look and she nods at the interviewer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we really are.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the interviews are all for the most part understandably Endgame focused and Brie has to correct a couple of people who refer to you vaguely as her friend, but by the end of the interviews you and Brie both felt like a huge weight had been lifted from your shoulders.</p><p>You\u2019re ushered further along to take some photos, which you find a bit overwhelming as the flashes of the cameras and the shouts of the photographers take you aback a little. Brie keeps a calm hold of your hand before letting go and moving to hold your waist, pulling you closer to her for some photos.</p><p>By now most of the cast had arrived and so the photographers request some photos with just the cast, so you and the other plus ones move to the side. Elsa comes to stand next to you as you both watch the cast posing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing really great for your first event,\u201d she says to you and you smile as you thank her. \u201cI\u2019m happy that both of you seem so happy.\u201d You go to reply but before you can, you hear loud shouts of Brie\u2019s name coming from a group of fans towards the end of the red carpet. She waves over to them but walks towards you first.</p><p>\u201cThis is going well, right?\u201d She asks teasingly before quickly kissing you on the cheek and offering a cheeky grin as she makes her way back to the fans. You feel your cheeks turn pink with a blush. Elsa chuckles and nudges you with her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou two make the rest of us look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, as if anyone could make you and Chris look bad,\u201d you reply and Elsa laughs as you and the rest of the plus ones are ushered to the end of the carpet to wait for your dates.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After Brie and the cast have finished interacting with the fans, you all head inside for the movie screening. The cast go up on stage for a short Q&amp;A of sorts and then return to their seats to watch to film. You and Brie hold hands throughout the movie, constantly smiling at each other at the realisation that you can act like a regular couple in public now, as much as Brie\u2019s celebrity status would let you anyway.</p><p>When the movies finishes, the cast briefly head back to the stage to discuss what an emotional rollercoaster the movie was.

I want you and only you.\u201d</p>",

She\u2019d always been patient with you and was happy to wait until you were ready, and with the Endgame world premiere happening tonight, you had both talked a lot about you joining Brie.</p><p>Brie sits down on the bed and you turn your head to glance towards the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you even doing awake? It looks like the sun\u2019s just come up.\u201d You look up at Brie and she offers a small shrug before sighing shortly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, jet lag is kicking my ass I think.\u201d She pouts and you can\u2019t help but chuckle at her. \u201cGood thing it\u2019s the last stop of the tour though, huh?\u201d You hum in agreement and watch Brie for a quiet moment. Her eyes scan your face and she sends you a tired grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back to bed?\u201d You mumble as you grab Brie by the hand and try to pull her towards you.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m already up. Might as well just stay up now,\u201d she says but she barely even fights it and a second later lets you pull her back down to lay next to you. \u201cBesides, some of the cast wanted to do brunch to catch up before the premiere tonight.\u201d You playfully roll your eyes at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie, babe. That\u2019s <i>brunch</i>. I\u2019d say we still have at least a couple of hours until then.\u201d You bring your hand up to move a strand of hair from her face, tucking it behind her ear. She hums and moves her body closer to you. Her eyes are watching you, almost studying you, and you tilt your head in question. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, just out of curiosity, you still wanted to come to the premiere with me tonight, right?\u201d She moves her hand to rest on your hip, her fingers playing with the hem of your shirt.</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah. I think so.\u201d Brie idly nods at you and you furrow your brow slightly. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Of course I want you to!\u201d She quickly gets out. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I checked my phone when I first woke up and apparently someone took some photos when we got here last night because my fans are kind of talking about us a lot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what do you mean they\u2019re talking about us? What are they saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mainly wondering who you are and if we\u2019re together. I think a couple of them might have found some older photos you\u2019re in, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d you say as you sit up on the bed and make yourself remain calm as you let it sink in that people you don\u2019t know are currently discussing you and Brie\u2019s relationship. Brie sits up too and takes your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cHey, the good news is that everyone seems to like us together.\u201d She shrugs and offers you a small smirk. \u201cWho can blame them, really? We are pretty great together.\u201d You laugh lightly and shake your head.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying, Miss Larson. You still want me to be your date tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be an honour.\u201d Brie leans in and kisses you softly before breaking apart with a grin on her face. \u201cAnd if you think about it, it\u2019s kind of the perfect time. Now that everyone\u2019s seen you, I think it makes sense to just let them all know that we\u2019re together now and get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d you say as move to lay back down on the bed, pulling Brie back down with you.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You and Brie spent the rest of the morning in bed cuddling before you had to get up in time to meet some of the cast for brunch. You had all agreed to just meet in the hotel restaurant mainly for the sake of everyone\u2019s privacy.</p><p>You and Brie join the table and sit down, you next to Robert and Brie next to Chris Hemsworth. They were both seated next to their own wives who had joined them for the last leg of the press tour. Across from you, Jeremy and Paul sit joking about something together. Scarlett, Karen, Mark and Chris Evans all sit together in conversation.</p><p>Everyone looks up and happily greets the both of you when you sit down. Your relationship up until this point might have been kept from most of the world, but the Avengers cast knew you and Brie were together and fully supported it.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see you\u2019ve finally decided to join us,\u201d Hemsworth immediately shoots at Brie with a smirk before sending you a quick wink in greeting.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, the strongest Avenger obviously needs to arrive fashionably late,\u201d she fires back.</p><p>\u201cHuh, that can\u2019t be right. I arrived on time,\u201d Chris furrows his brow before him and Brie break into laughter.</p><p>Elsa, Chris\u2019 wife, looks at you and rolls her eyes before she chuckles at the playful banter. Chris and Brie\u2019s friendship had become a hot topic during the entire press tour. There were constant discussions over whether they hated each other or whether they genuinely got along. Obviously the two found the arguments hilarious, so the banter probably wasn\u2019t ending any time soon.</p><p>\u201cSo, Kid,\u201d Robert says and you turn your head to look at him. \u201cPress tour\u2019s almost done. Have you enjoyed hanging out with us idiots this whole time?\u201d You laugh and give the group a quick glance.</p><p>\u201cI really have. To be honest, I don\u2019t think there could have been a better group of people to do this with.\u201d Robert nods in agreement.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re definitely not terrible people to be around.\u201d By this point Scarlett and Chris Evans are listening in and smiling. \u201cSo, have you decided on tonight yet? Does Brie finally get to bring a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I went on Twitter this morning and saw some fans talking about you guys,\u201d Chris says. \u201cHave you gone public yet?\u201d You feel Brie grab your hand under the table and squeeze it.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we think maybe tonight\u2019s the night. What\u2019s the point in waiting any longer?\u201d Both Chris and Scarlett let out sounds of excitement and the rest of the table are grinning in yours and Brie\u2019s direction.</p><p><br>\n\u201cYes! I\u2019m so happy for you two!\u201d Scarlett exclaims. \u201cYou finally get to let your guards down and just be a couple!\u201d Others chime in with their own congratulations and words of reassurance. They all know that Brie hasn\u2019t publicly come out yet and so you both have a lot of nerves, but their words do wonders in calming you both down.</p><p>You look to Brie, who already has her eyes on you. She\u2019s wearing a small smile but you know she\u2019s watching you for any hint of discomfort with the conversation, so you return her smile and nod at her. As her smile grows, you have no doubt in your mind that this is the right time.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The car you and Brie are in comes to a stop. You knew that, being the premiere, this is the first time the cast would all see the movie so they were understandably excited and emotional, but all you could think about was the red carpet you had to deal with first.</p><p>Brie pulls you out of your thoughts when she takes your hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cYou okay there, babe?\u201d She asks and she shifts herself closer to you. You nod and let out a bit of a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cYeah I think so. Definitely pretty nervous.\u201d You laugh a little unsurely as you look at Brie. \u201cHow about you? I mean, this is a big deal, right? Are you sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says gently, pulling your hand to her lips and pressing them against it before bringing it back down to rest in her lap. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready for this, I\u2019m ready for this. There\u2019s literally no one else I\u2019d rather do this with than you. You know that, right?\u201d You nod and she pulls you into a hug, pressing a kiss to the top of your head.</p><p>\u201cAlright, now how about we go rock this red carpet?\u201d She playfully raises her eyebrows at you and you laugh at her, a sound that makes her grin widely.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d She nods before she gives the thumbs up to the driver, who had been waiting patiently by the car door while you and Brie talked. He opens the door and Brie gracefully exits the car, turning back to offer her hand to you. You let out a deep breath and accept her hand, letting her help you out of the car.</p><p>You smooth down the front of your dress, a vibrant red one you fell in love with earlier on in the press tour, before you and Brie thank the driver and he takes his leave. Brie is in a blue dress which exposes her back and hugs her body perfectly, and you can\u2019t help but let your eyes wander her frame for a moment.</p><p>From where you stand, the red carpet is slightly out of view, giving Brie and yourself another moment to collect yourselves a bit. Robert and his wife, having just stepped out of their own car, make their way towards you in the direction of the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cSee you ladies out there. You\u2019re gonna kill it, you both look fantastic.\u201d He enthusiastically sends you a thumbs up and then disappears around the corner to enter the red carpet. Immediately the sound of screaming fans can be heard and you shoot Brie an alarmed expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that can be a little intimidating at first.\u201d She laughs and grabs your hand. \u201cBut look at it this way. We\u2019re getting the biggest event out of the way first, so anything else after this will be way less scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna choose to accept that,\u201d you say and she chuckles.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Brie smiles and lets her eyes scan over your body before they meet yours again. \u201cRobert\u2019s right, by the way. You look amazing.\u201d She interlocks your fingers with her own before giving you a reassuring smile. \u201cNow let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d</p><p>You make your way to the carpet and immediately the fans start screaming again. Brie escorts you along and waves at the fans, grinning brightly at them. You notice some fans excitedly pointing towards you, clearly recognising you from photos. Brie lets go of your hand to chat with some fans and take some selfies and you watch her proudly. You can\u2019t help the grin that finds itself on your face when Brie returns to you a couple minutes later and takes your hand again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019ve gotta admit this is kind of cool.\u201d You both laugh, you mainly from nerves, as you look around at all the fans and at some other cast members who have already arrived and are making their own way around the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cOf course this is cool, this is the Avengers we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Brie smiles at you and you both are escorted to where other cast members are already doing interviews. You notice that everyone else\u2019s partners for the most part have joined in on the interviews but you hesitate until Brie nods her head towards the press.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d she says as she makes her way over to the first interviewer. She grips your hand tightly and you have the thought that maybe she needs you with her in this moment. After all, up until now Brie hadn\u2019t publicly come out and it occurs to you that this red carpet is probably as scary for her as it is for you.</p><p>The first couple interviews are pretty dull for lack of a better word, and for the most part it seems like the interviewers are actively trying to ignore you despite Brie\u2019s efforts to include you in the conversations.</p><p>The third interviewer Brie approaches asks her a couple of Endgame focused questions before gesturing towards you with a kind smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd who do you have with you tonight?\u201d Brie quickly glances at you and you squeeze her hand and offer a nervous smile before she looks back to the interviewer.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re actually the first to ask me that. This is actually my girlfriend, (Y/N).\u201d The interviewer immediately lights up.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad to hear that! I\u2019d seen a lot of fans debating over whether you were together or not and I didn\u2019t want to pry, but you both look really happy!\u201d You and Brie share a look and she nods at the interviewer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we really are.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the interviews are all for the most part understandably Endgame focused and Brie has to correct a couple of people who refer to you vaguely as her friend, but by the end of the interviews you and Brie both felt like a huge weight had been lifted from your shoulders.</p><p>You\u2019re ushered further along to take some photos, which you find a bit overwhelming as the flashes of the cameras and the shouts of the photographers take you aback a little. Brie keeps a calm hold of your hand before letting go and moving to hold your waist, pulling you closer to her for some photos.</p><p>By now most of the cast had arrived and so the photographers request some photos with just the cast, so you and the other plus ones move to the side. Elsa comes to stand next to you as you both watch the cast posing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing really great for your first event,\u201d she says to you and you smile as you thank her. \u201cI\u2019m happy that both of you seem so happy.\u201d You go to reply but before you can, you hear loud shouts of Brie\u2019s name coming from a group of fans towards the end of the red carpet. She waves over to them but walks towards you first.</p><p>\u201cThis is going well, right?\u201d She asks teasingly before quickly kissing you on the cheek and offering a cheeky grin as she makes her way back to the fans. You feel your cheeks turn pink with a blush. Elsa chuckles and nudges you with her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou two make the rest of us look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, as if anyone could make you and Chris look bad,\u201d you reply and Elsa laughs as you and the rest of the plus ones are ushered to the end of the carpet to wait for your dates.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After Brie and the cast have finished interacting with the fans, you all head inside for the movie screening. The cast go up on stage for a short Q&amp;A of sorts and then return to their seats to watch to film. You and Brie hold hands throughout the movie, constantly smiling at each other at the realisation that you can act like a regular couple in public now, as much as Brie\u2019s celebrity status would let you anyway.</p><p>When the movies finishes, the cast briefly head back to the stage to discuss what an emotional rollercoaster the movie was. Eventually, everyone slowly files out, the cast taking some time to excitedly talk about the film together for a while before deciding to head back to the hotel for the unofficial afterparty Robert had planned. Technically most of the cast lived around LA, you and Brie included, and didn\u2019t need to stay in the hotel, but Marvel insisted and none of you were complaining at the fancy hotel they decided to put you in.</p><p>The cast had planned a more official party at Robert\u2019s house the next day, so tonight\u2019s afterparty was a lot more low key than you expected. Not long after heading back to the hotel, you find yourself sitting on the bed in your hotel room checking your phone while Brie undresses and puts on her sleepwear.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like we\u2019re already trending,\u201d you tell her. \u201cOh my god, how did they find me on Instagram so fast?!\u201d Brie laughs and comes over to join you on the bed, sitting next to you.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. This is what happens when the world finally gets to meet my amazing girlfriend.\u201d You nudge her shoulder affectionately and laugh.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I forget how sappy you can be.\u201d Brie rolls her eyes at you and nudges you back. \u201cAt least now I can finally brag about Brie Larson wanting me.\u201d Brie laughs and brings you in for a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s right, baby. I want you and only you.\u201d</p>",

Opening one eye, you see Brie moving around the room, still dressed in the tank top and shorts she went to bed in the night before. As you roll your body to face her, you let out a groan and she turns to look at you with a soft smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re up!&rdquo; She happily says before having a good look at you, clearly not happy to be awake just yet. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wake you, did I?&rdquo; She speaks with a hushed tone and offers you an apologetic smile as she makes her way back towards the bed.</p><p>The two of you found yourselves in a hotel room in LA, the last of several stops you had made with Brie on the current Avengers: Endgame press tour.

You look amazing.&rdquo; She interlocks your fingers with her own before giving you a reassuring smile. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s do this thing.&rdquo;</p><p>You make your way to the carpet and immediately the fans start screaming again.

You can&rsquo;t help the grin that finds itself on your face when Brie returns to you a couple minutes later and takes your hand again.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, you&rsquo;ve gotta admit this is kind of cool.&rdquo; You both laugh, you mainly from nerves, as you look around at all the fans and at some other cast members who have already arrived and are making their own way around the red carpet.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course this is cool, this is the Avengers we&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Brie smiles at you and you both are escorted to where other cast members are already doing interviews. You notice that everyone else&rsquo;s partners for the most part have joined in on the interviews but you hesitate until Brie nods her head towards the press.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with me,&rdquo; she says as she makes her way over to the first interviewer. She grips your hand tightly and you have the thought that maybe she needs you with her in this moment. After all, up until now Brie hadn&rsquo;t publicly come out and it occurs to you that this red carpet is probably as scary for her as it is for you.</p><p>The first couple interviews are pretty dull for lack of a better word, and for the most part it seems like the interviewers are actively trying to ignore you despite Brie&rsquo;s efforts to include you in the conversations.</p><p>The third interviewer Brie approaches asks her a couple of Endgame focused questions before gesturing towards you with a kind smile.</p><p>&ldquo;And who do you have with you tonight?&rdquo; Brie quickly glances at you and you squeeze her hand and offer a nervous smile before she looks back to the interviewer.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re actually the first to ask me that. This is actually my girlfriend, (Y/N).&rdquo; The interviewer immediately lights up.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad to hear that! I&rsquo;d seen a lot of fans debating over whether you were together or not and I didn&rsquo;t want to pry, but you both look really happy!&rdquo; You and Brie share a look and she nods at the interviewer.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we really are.&rdquo;</p><p>The rest of the interviews are all for the most part understandably Endgame focused and Brie has to correct a couple of people who refer to you vaguely as her friend, but by the end of the interviews you and Brie both felt like a huge weight had been lifted from your shoulders.</p><p>You&rsquo;re ushered further along to take some photos, which you find a bit overwhelming as the flashes of the cameras and the shouts of the photographers take you aback a little. Brie keeps a calm hold of your hand before letting go and moving to hold your waist, pulling you closer to her for some photos.</p><p>By now most of the cast had arrived and so the photographers request some photos with just the cast, so you and the other plus ones move to the side. Elsa comes to stand next to you as you both watch the cast posing.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing really great for your first event,&rdquo; she says to you and you smile as you thank her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that both of you seem so happy.&rdquo; You go to reply but before you can, you hear loud shouts of Brie&rsquo;s name coming from a group of fans towards the end of the red carpet. She waves over to them but walks towards you first.</p><p>&ldquo;This is going well, right?&rdquo; She asks teasingly before quickly kissing you on the cheek and offering a cheeky grin as she makes her way back to the fans. You feel your cheeks turn pink with a blush. Elsa chuckles and nudges you with her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;You two make the rest of us look bad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please, as if anyone could make you and Chris look bad,&rdquo; you reply and Elsa laughs as you and the rest of the plus ones are ushered to the end of the carpet to wait for your dates.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>After Brie and the cast have finished interacting with the fans, you all head inside for the movie screening. The cast go up on stage for a short Q&amp;A of sorts and then return to their seats to watch to film. You and Brie hold hands throughout the movie, constantly smiling at each other at the realisation that you can act like a regular couple in public now, as much as Brie&rsquo;s celebrity status would let you anyway.</p><p>When the movies finishes, the cast briefly head back to the stage to discuss what an emotional rollercoaster the movie was. Eventually, everyone slowly files out, the cast taking some time to excitedly talk about the film together for a while before deciding to head back to the hotel for the unofficial afterparty Robert had planned. Technically most of the cast lived around LA, you and Brie included, and didn&rsquo;t need to stay in the hotel, but Marvel insisted and none of you were complaining at the fancy hotel they decided to put you in.</p><p>The cast had planned a more official party at Robert&rsquo;s house the next day, so tonight&rsquo;s afterparty was a lot more low key than you expected. Not long after heading back to the hotel, you find yourself sitting on the bed in your hotel room checking your phone while Brie undresses and puts on her sleepwear.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it looks like we&rsquo;re already trending,&rdquo; you tell her. &ldquo;Oh my god, how did they find me on Instagram so fast?!&rdquo; Brie laughs and comes over to join you on the bed, sitting next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m surprised. This is what happens when the world finally gets to meet my amazing girlfriend.&rdquo; You nudge her shoulder affectionately and laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes I forget how sappy you can be.&rdquo; Brie rolls her eyes at you and nudges you back. &ldquo;At least now I can finally brag about Brie Larson wanting me.&rdquo; Brie laughs and brings you in for a quick kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s right, baby. I want you and only you.&rdquo;</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>Request:</b><br /></p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://starslazyandcosy.tumblr.com/\">starslazyandcosy</a>:  &ldquo;Could you write something with Brie having her longtime girlfriend joining her for the Captain marvel/ Avengers Endgame press tour. Like how it goes in the morning, or on the red carpet, when Brie doing interviews or a diner with the whole cast. Also with Y/N not being a celebrity.&ldquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Pairing:</b>&nbsp;Brie x reader</p>\n<p><b>A/N:</b> Yeah, this was originally not going to be a full fic idea, I was going to stick with headcanons but something happened and I ended up with a full story so&hellip; Also, writing for real people is something I had a lot of difficulty doing, and ended up rewriting quite a lot of this several times, so I really hope it&rsquo;s okay and that people are &lsquo;in character&rsquo; for at least majority of it. As usual, please enjoy and any feedback is appreciated!</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</p>",

Her interests and character traits are typically masculine: she&rsquo;s aggressive, confident, and competitive. She&rsquo;s a pilot and a fighter. She&rsquo;s a feminist in that she&rsquo;s constantly showing that a woman can do anything a man can do. </p><p>Janet Van Dyne, in the comics at least, is on the opposite end of the spectrum. She&rsquo;s a very feminine woman with very feminine characteristics. She&rsquo;s fashionable, compassionate, and graceful. She took her daddy&rsquo;s money and turned it into a fashion empire, designing clothes and costumes for civilians and fellow superheroes. Even in her superheroing, she takes a &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; approach, preferring diplomacy and understanding to violent action. She&rsquo;s not afraid to defend herself or others if necessary, but she&rsquo;d prefer to talk down the enemy than knock them out. She fosters communication between her teammates and cares more about their emotional wellbeing than even they do. She&rsquo;s a feminist in that she constantly shows that not only are women&rsquo;s interests and ideals valid, but also necessary and powerful in their own way. </p><p>Both of these characters are important and strong. They both contribute in their own way to the furthering of gender equality. </p><p>So anyway, thanks for coming to my TED Talk. </p><p>(PS: if you have any issue with my phrasing or conclusions please let me know, I&rsquo;m always trying to broaden my perspective.)</p>",
