That valentine you wrote Harry &ndash; green eyes like a toad, right?&rdquo; Ron goaded, reciting the love poem Ginny had written in her first-year.

Shut up!&rdquo; George crossed his arms to form an X and hurriedly tried to quieten them down.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, George!&rdquo; Ron started laughing so loudly, that he bent over and burrowed his head underneath a blanket, his chortles muffled by the quilt. Even Hermione couldn&rsquo;t help it, her eyes tearing up as she giggled behind a closed mouth, her lips quivering and shoulders shaking &ndash; she was trying not to laugh.<br/>\nFred looked at George, his mouth agape.</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>snogged</i> Angelina!?&rdquo;<br/>\nGeorge blushed hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Well what was I s'posed to do?! She thought I was <i>you!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>You</b> should&rsquo;ve done it when <b>you</b> had the chance!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;WHY YOU-!&rdquo;</p><p>Fred threw his cards up in the air\u00a0and\u00a0tackled George, pinning him to the floor.\u00a0They both managed to\u00a0hook their legs around the other&rsquo;s waist and were soon hurtling across the bedroom floor, grabbing at each other&rsquo;s hair and clothes. Ginny and Ron tried to get them apart, still in hysterics, while Hermione approached the fray, urgently trying to mediate some sort of peace.</p><p>Back in the nook of Ron and Harry&rsquo;s beds, Cedric scoured and peeked at Fred&rsquo;s stray cards.</p><p>Aha! He <i>was </i>bluffing!&ldquo; he said, pumping his fist into the air.</p><p>&quot;It doesn&rsquo;t even matter,\u00a0they&rsquo;ve both basically folded now.&rdquo; Harry groaned but he couldn&rsquo;t help but find the sight amusing, watching as Ginny slammed her fist against her two brothers heads in an effort to get them to stop brawling</p><p>It&hellip; didn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>Cedric began to defend himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I was just going to tell them that Angelina, <i>lovingly, </i>doesn&rsquo;t prefer <b>either </b>of them &ndash; since she doesn&rsquo;t even know whether they like <i>her </i>or not.&rdquo; Cedric shrugged. &ldquo;They both needed a push like this, it was important information.&rdquo;<br/>\nHarry snickered and then turned to Cedric, using his cards like a shield in front of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then, what important information have you got to make <i>me,\u00a0</i>fold?&rdquo; he challenged.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, let me see&hellip;&rdquo; Cedric thought, glancing down at his own hand, he looked as if in serious thought.<br/>\nHarry\u00a0stared at him, expectantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, have I mentioned that your haircut looks great on you?&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\n  <i>Huh.</i>\n</p><p>It was a week after he arrived back to Privet Drive when Miss Figgs cut his hair, apparently unable to bear seeing Harry, look like a &rsquo;<i>shaggy dog&rsquo;. </i>She had nearly shaved the entire bottom base of his head, before cutting his curly, bed-headed locks shorter &ndash; keeping his forehead and sight clear, but still long enough to cover his scar with a fringe.</p><p>Harry paused.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Nice try, but I don&rsquo;t think <i>that&rsquo;s</i> going to work.&rdquo; He snorted. He looked up and saw Cedric\u00a0staring straight back at him; a slight smile on his face, and his eyebrows furrowed as if he was asking;</p><p>\n  <i>'Why not?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Oh.</p><p><i>He\u2019s serious.<br/></i>Harry thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Course, I am!&rdquo; Cedric suddenly burst out.<br/><br/></p><p>Ah. <br/>Harry said that out loud.</p><p>He panicked.</p><p>\u00a0&quot;Uh sorr-&ldquo;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Its nice that you left your natural curls though&hellip;&rdquo; Cedric murmured, interrupting him as he reached over,\u00a0and lightly swept his fingers against the top of Harry&rsquo;s hair.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that you <i>didn't\u00a0\u00a0</i>look good before, you just look better now. More&hellip;adulty.&rdquo; Cedric added hastily, tilting his head when he said <i>'adulty&rsquo; ,\u00a0</i>his lips thinned into a lopsided smirk as he made the word up.</p><p>Harry became very suddenly aware of Cedric&rsquo;s fingers, and how they traced all the way down to the shaved underside of his head, light touches grazing between the edge of his hair and his neck.<br/><br/></p><p>\nHe had rarely let anyone touch his head especially after that one time Petunia, not willing to <i>'waste'\u00a0\u00a0</i>money on a proper barber, chopped it herself.\u00a0</p><p>But Miss Figgs, Mrs Weasley, Sirius and even with Ron and Hermione,\u00a0<br/>he\u2019s never felt something, <i>quite, </i>like what he was feeling now.</p><p>Harry watched Cedric\u2019s hands retreat and go back to holding his cards.</p><p>&ldquo;I, er&ndash;&rdquo; Harry fumbled for something to say &ldquo;&hellip;Thank you\u2026?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>\nIn response, Cedric grinned and looked back down at his cards.</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t <i>actually </i>an attempt to get you to fold by the way, I just wanted to tell you.&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;R-right, thanks.&rdquo; Harry mumbled. He began to reorganize his cards even though they didn&rsquo;t really need any shifting, his head turning into a melting pot of confusion, surprise and mechanic beeping, like the robot show that Dudley kept watching on the telly; chiming off, stirring and mushing into an ugly mess inside his brain as silence followed Cedric&rsquo;s compliment, or, as much silence that could be had with the twin&rsquo;s scuffle in background.</p><p><i>Maybe I should compliment him back?\u00a0\u00a0</i>Harry thought. But he couldn&rsquo;t actually remember whether Cedric&rsquo;s appearance had changed at all, afraid to bring his eyes up, just in case Cedric was already looking at him for a response. Suddenly a large <i>CRACK</i> echoed in the room; Fred and George had apparated away.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Ginny huffed, suddenly appearing in the nook and sitting back down on the floor. &ldquo;Those two idiots have gone away to sort their issues upstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that their apparating is convenient for <i>one, </i>good thing.&rdquo; Hermione sighed, appearing as well; relieved.</p><p>Soon Ginny, Ron and Hermione sat down, eager to continue the game and so Harry was saved for the moment.</p><p>He scratched the back of his neck.<br/>It was red again.</p><hr><p><i>from <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16231847/chapters/37943867#_=_\">Stay Alive For Now</a>\u00a0by nunchikoi</i></p>",

While Cedric laughed and continued the entire round like normal, like Ginny, he did not <i>dare</i> look Harry in the eyes.</p><p>But he would soon get George back, in the final and current Game Six of Nine,&nbsp;as he brought up the&nbsp;Yule Ball, and the important name of <i>Angelina Johnson </i>to the everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on, didn&rsquo;t she go with Fred?&rdquo; Ron raised, puzzled. &ldquo;So doesn&rsquo;t she <i>prefer </i>Fred?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s how I remember it&hellip;&rdquo; Fred narrowed his eyes and glanced at George, who wildly brought his hands up, pleading innocence.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me!&rdquo; He said defensively. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even have a date last year, you all were haggling me about it for months before <b>and&nbsp;</b>afterwards!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?! But I <i>swear, </i>when everyone was moshing to the band,&nbsp;I saw you and a girl behind the curtains&hellip; snogging&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\nGinny paused. Something washed over her and also Ron, and they suddenly howled in realization.</p><p>&ldquo;No, <i>no, </i>shut up! Shut up!&rdquo; George crossed his arms to form an X and hurriedly tried to quieten them down.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, George!&rdquo; Ron started laughing so loudly, that he bent over and burrowed his head underneath a blanket, his chortles muffled by the quilt. Even Hermione couldn&rsquo;t help it, her eyes tearing up as she giggled behind a closed mouth, her lips quivering and shoulders shaking &ndash; she was trying not to laugh.<br />\nFred looked at George, his mouth agape.</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>snogged</i> Angelina!?&rdquo;<br />\nGeorge blushed hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Well what was I s'posed to do?! She thought I was <i>you!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>You</b> should&rsquo;ve done it when <b>you</b> had the chance!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;WHY YOU-!&rdquo;</p><p>Fred threw his cards up in the air&nbsp;and&nbsp;tackled George, pinning him to the floor.&nbsp;They both managed to&nbsp;hook their legs around the other&rsquo;s waist and were soon hurtling across the bedroom floor, grabbing at each other&rsquo;s hair and clothes. Ginny and Ron tried to get them apart, still in hysterics, while Hermione approached the fray, urgently trying to mediate some sort of peace.</p><p>Back in the nook of Ron and Harry&rsquo;s beds, Cedric scoured and peeked at Fred&rsquo;s stray cards.</p><p>Aha! He <i>was </i>bluffing!&ldquo; he said, pumping his fist into the air.</p><p>\"It doesn&rsquo;t even matter,&nbsp;they&rsquo;ve both basically folded now.&rdquo; Harry groaned but he couldn&rsquo;t help but find the sight amusing, watching as Ginny slammed her fist against her two brothers heads in an effort to get them to stop brawling</p><p>It&hellip; didn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>Cedric began to defend himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I was just going to tell them that Angelina, <i>lovingly, </i>doesn&rsquo;t prefer <b>either </b>of them &ndash; since she doesn&rsquo;t even know whether they like <i>her </i>or not.&rdquo; Cedric shrugged. &ldquo;They both needed a push like this, it was important information.&rdquo;<br />\nHarry snickered and then turned to Cedric, using his cards like a shield in front of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then, what important information have you got to make <i>me,&nbsp;</i>fold?&rdquo; he challenged.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, let me see&hellip;&rdquo; Cedric thought, glancing down at his own hand, he looked as if in serious thought.<br />\nHarry&nbsp;stared at him, expectantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, have I mentioned that your haircut looks great on you?&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>\n  <i>Huh.</i>\n</p><p>It was a week after he arrived back to Privet Drive when Miss Figgs cut his hair, apparently unable to bear seeing Harry, look like a &rsquo;<i>shaggy dog&rsquo;. </i>She had nearly shaved the entire bottom base of his head, before cutting his curly, bed-headed locks shorter &ndash; keeping his forehead and sight clear, but still long enough to cover his scar with a fringe.</p><p>Harry paused.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice try, but I don&rsquo;t think <i>that&rsquo;s</i> going to work.&rdquo; He snorted. He looked up and saw Cedric&nbsp;staring straight back at him; a slight smile on his face, and his eyebrows furrowed as if he was asking;</p><p>\n  <i>'Why not?&rsquo;</i>\n</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Oh.</p><p><i>He&rsquo;s serious.<br /></i>Harry thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Course, I am!&rdquo; Cedric suddenly burst out.<br /><br /></p><p>Ah. <br />Harry said that out loud.</p><p>He panicked.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Uh sorr-&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\"Its nice that you left your natural curls though&hellip;&rdquo; Cedric murmured, interrupting him as he reached over,&nbsp;and lightly swept his fingers against the top of Harry&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that you <i>didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>look good before, you just look better now. More&hellip;adulty.&rdquo; Cedric added hastily, tilting his head when he said <i>'adulty&rsquo; ,&nbsp;</i>his lips thinned into a lopsided smirk as he made the word up.</p><p>Harry became very suddenly aware of Cedric&rsquo;s fingers, and how they traced all the way down to the shaved underside of his head, light touches grazing between the edge of his hair and his neck.<br /><br /></p><p>\nHe had rarely let anyone touch his head especially after that one time Petunia, not willing to <i>'waste'&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>money on a proper barber, chopped it herself.&nbsp;</p><p>But Miss Figgs, Mrs Weasley, Sirius and even with Ron and Hermione,&nbsp;<br />he&rsquo;s never felt something, <i>quite, </i>like what he was feeling now.</p><p>Harry watched Cedric&rsquo;s hands retreat and go back to holding his cards.</p><p>&ldquo;I, er&ndash;&rdquo; Harry fumbled for something to say &ldquo;&hellip;Thank you&hellip;?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\nIn response, Cedric grinned and looked back down at his cards.</p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t <i>actually </i>an attempt to get you to fold by the way, I just wanted to tell you.&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;R-right, thanks.&rdquo; Harry mumbled. He began to reorganize his cards even though they didn&rsquo;t really need any shifting, his head turning into a melting pot of confusion, surprise and mechanic beeping, like the robot show that Dudley kept watching on the telly; chiming off, stirring and mushing into an ugly mess inside his brain as silence followed Cedric&rsquo;s compliment, or, as much silence that could be had with the twin&rsquo;s scuffle in background.</p><p><i>Maybe I should compliment him back?&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Harry thought. But he couldn&rsquo;t actually remember whether Cedric&rsquo;s appearance had changed at all, afraid to bring his eyes up, just in case Cedric was already looking at him for a response. Suddenly a large <i>CRACK</i> echoed in the room; Fred and George had apparated away.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Ginny huffed, suddenly appearing in the nook and sitting back down on the floor. &ldquo;Those two idiots have gone away to sort their issues upstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that their apparating is convenient for <i>one, </i>good thing.&rdquo; Hermione sighed, appearing as well; relieved.</p><p>Soon Ginny, Ron and Hermione sat down, eager to continue the game and so Harry was saved for the moment.</p><p>He scratched the back of his neck.<br />It was red again.</p><hr /><p><i>from <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16231847/chapters/37943867#_=_\">Stay Alive For Now</a>&nbsp;by nunchikoi</i></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><i>an excerpt from a hedric fanfic where <b>everything is the same except cedric diggory lives.</b></i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&ldquo;George, if you tell me whether Fred is bluffing, I&rsquo;ll tell you which twin Angelina prefers.&rdquo; Cedric suddenly said, utterly deadpan and serious as he held tight onto his hand of cards. George&rsquo;s face dropped, while Ron gave a sharp whistle, Ginny cackling madly.</p>\n<p>Back in Ron and Harry&rsquo;s bedroom, a drawn out, nine-round card game was being played, at Cedric&rsquo;s suggestion. It was a way for everyone&rsquo;s ears to cool after Mrs Weasley&rsquo;s piercing screams, and for time to pass quickly,&nbsp;until they were finally allowed to go downstairs.&nbsp;In order to raise the spirits of everyone crammed between the nook of Ron and Harry&rsquo;s beds, there was a combined hoard of cookies made out of everyone&rsquo;s own personal stash, and&nbsp;an abundance of blankets, duvet&rsquo;s and even the room&rsquo;s own curtains; that covered and as acted as cushions for the hard, wooden floor &ndash; softening and trying to disguise the inherent harsh and cold bedroom. Fred had re-enchanted a bauble of light to float perpetually in the middle of the ring they made on the floor and Hermione taken candles out of their lanterns, trying as much as she could to reflect a warm glow.</p>\n<p>While their moods recovered, nobody took the game seriously until Cedric &ndash; halfway through &ndash; dubbed it <i>&ldquo;The Final Hufflepuff-Gryffindor showdown&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;, as if was an unofficial or preliminary rematch of the Quidditch game that Gryffindor lost to Hufflepuff all those months ago.</p>\n<p>Lying and poker-faces weren&rsquo;t as much of an arsenal compared to the social bribery, sabotage and blackmail that suddenly dominated the game. And with four out of the six Gryffindors already out &ndash; having lost or folded in the previous rounds &ndash; the lone Hufflepuff taunted at their house pride.</p>\n<p>And so obviously, the stakes were high.</p>\n</p>",

She has lowered empathy and lower integrity, but she still feels guilty about a lot of things, often very suddenly and about everything at once, including things that weren\u2019t her fault. It\u2019s a bad circle in her case, because she always thought she was a bad kid, with no chance to ever not be, so now she really behaves poorly. It\u2019s often easier to just meet expectations, especially for a child.</p>",

Not even in her school years had she enjoyed the rambunctious affairs that would take place in her common room. Although this has evoked much teasing from her friends, she thought that they would someday grow out of the party scene themselves. Maybe she didn\u2019t know her friends too well. </p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll watch Harry, Lils. No, not a burden at all. I\u2019ll be at your\u2019s in a few. Love you too. Bye,\u201d y/n said, putting the phone back on the receiver. She chuckled lightly to herself. Of course they were going to a party to celebrate the new year. It agitated her a bit that she hadn\u2019t called earlier. She wondered what Lily would\u2019ve done if she had plans. But, there was no one she would rather have at her side at the start of the new year than her sweet godson that she loved dearly.</p><p>Y/n showed up at the Potter\u2019s house at around 7 o\u2019clock. She was immediately overwhelmed with the smell of Lily\u2019s perfume. She could hear James\u2019 voice coming from the kitchen. She walked to the doorway and saw Harry giggling up at his father, who was dancing to the music that was playing from Harry\u2019s toy boom box. </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes eventually met the ones of his godmother, and he went to run up and hug her, but she quickly put her finger to her lips and pointed at James. She smirked, walking up behind him and imitating his dance moves. James, too in the moment to notice, thought that Harry was really eating his dance moves up. James went to do a spin move and was surprised to see y/n standing behind him, doing the same dance he had just been doing. He shook his head, a small smile creeping up his face. </p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t been laughing at me?\u201d James asked Harry, a pout forming on his face. Harry made a thin line with his lips, solemnly shaking his head. </p><p>\u201cSorry, aunt y/n was being funnier.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019 jaw dropped and his hand flew to his chest in mock offense. Once Harry started to chuckle again, James turned around abruptly, throwing a glance over his shoulder, winking at his son. He turned back to y/n, kissing her in the cheek. </p><p>\u201cThank you so much for watching the twerp,\u201d he said, making sure the \u2018twerp\u2019 came out louder than the rest of his sentence. Harry scoffed behind him, muttering a \u201chey\u201d. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go alert the wife that you\u2019re here,\u201d he stated, turning and running up the stairs. Y/n  shook her head and smiled softly at the man who hadn\u2019t changed over the past 9 years they had been out of school for. Her head quickly jerked forward when two small arms wrapped around her and squeezed her. She smiled, laying her head on top of his and picking him up, spinning around with him in her arms. He laughed loudly, stumbling around a little when she let him down. Harry looked up at her with a mischievous grin on his face. </p><p>\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d he asked looking around to see if he could find what he was looking for. Of course y/n had brought it. They had talked about it last time she had been over, both of them knowing she would inevitably be the one to watch him on December 31st. </p><p>\u201cDid I bring what?\u201d she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion, looking down at the boy as if she was completely oblivious. Harry tilted his head to the side, unamused. He glanced at the couch and saw her bag. He looked back up at y/n and smiled, before running to the couch and fumbling through her bag. </p><p>\u201cCareful Har Bear, records break easily you know?\u201d she teased the eager boy. Harry pulled his hands out of her bag and brought them behind his back, smiling down towards the ground bashfully. Y/n reached down and started tickling the young boy. He was laughing and squirming vigorously. </p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d y/n stated, not going to stop until she made her godson surrender. </p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-ah!\u201d He tried to get out, his own involuntary shriek cutting him off. </p><p>\u201cSay it or I\u2019m not stopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not your uncle.\u201d She grinned down at the boy. </p><p>\u201cAunt! Aunt, aunt, aunt!\u201d Harry yelled, out of breath. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s very fair, y/n.\u201d an amused voice said from the doorway. \u201cUncle is the universal term for \u2018I give up\u2019. Can\u2019t just go switching the rules up on my boy like that.\u201d James stated, a smiling Lily behind him. </p><p>\u201cWell don\u2019t you two look lovely,\u201d y/n quipped, taking in the couple\u2019s appearance. She had always thought they looked good together; they were both very attractive people. </p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, y/n,\u201d lily smiled, walking over to hug her. \u201cWe should be back no later than two, but if something were to happen, we\u2019ll let you know,\u201d she said, kissing her son\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201cYou two behave. I don\u2019t want another call from Mrs. Bagshot saying it sounds like pots and pans banging together all up and down the street,\u201d James smirked, causing y/n to look down at Harry and roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI have to repeat myself everytime I talk to her. Beastie Boys are loud, but they\u2019re not that loud dad,\u201d Harry stated, earning a stern look from his mother and a proud smile from his father. The six year old\u2019s taste in music had always impressed y/n. He was very grown up for his age, obviously talking after his mother and herself. </p><p>\u201cWe shall return,\u201d James said, performing his and Harry\u2019s handshake and kissing the top of his head. </p><p>\u201cNo boys.\u201d James stated, throwing you a wink. Him and his son both started to sing their rendition of \u2018Y/n and Sirius sitting in a tree\u2019. She still wasn\u2019t sure how they all knew about her crush. They always just said it was obvious. It was just a silly crush though, y/n knew it was not realistic. A silly crush that had lasted for close to ten years. </p><p>The couple then walked out of the door, throwing out one last \u201cbehave\u201d before shutting it. </p><p>Harry turned to his godmother, tapping his foot eagerly. Her heart swelled as he reminded her so much of the marauders. They always wanted to listen to whatever records she had in her dorm, quickly becoming obsessed with the artist for a week, before moving swiftly on to another. This is exactly how Harry was. </p><p>\u201cWhich one first?\u201d she asked, already knowing the answer. She pulled out Licensed to Ill and started walking toward the turntable. Harry opened his mouth, but quickly shut it seeing that y/n had already read his mind. </p><p>He started to jump around as the first song, Rhymin and Stealin\u2019, rang throughout the house. </p><p>\u201cThis is gonna be a long night,\u201d Y/n thought before joining Harry in his dancing escapade. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Y/n thought that Harry would want to listen to the record two times tops, then switch over to some of his other favorites. She had tried to put on Rubber Soul, but Harry just wasn\u2019t having it. </p><p>It was now 10:40, and Harry was out cold. He had fallen asleep on the couch while she had gotten up to fix him some milk, hoping it might coax him into sleep. When she returned, she smiled down at the boy, reaching out for a blanket and pulling it over him. She sat down in hopes of herself being able to go to sleep too. She started to drift off, until she was jostled awake by the start of Fight For Your Right. She huffed, abruptly standing and trudging over to turn the record player off alltogether. She was interrupted by a knock on the door.  </p><p>Contemplating whether she should turn off the music or open the door first, she chose the latter. Tiptoeing towards the door in hopes of not waking Harry, her intentions were in vain when she opened the door to a very handsome, very plastered friend of hers. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Ello love. What\u2019re yah doin here?\u201d he asked, a genuine smile forming on his face. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes had a layer of gloss covering them. She smiled amusingly at him. </p><p>\u201cFawn-sitting. Are you drunk?\u201d she asked, obviously knowing the answer to her question. </p><p>Sirius laughed at the first part, only to straighten up and look at her in an attempt to tell her he was, in fact, not drunk. She raised her eyebrows at him, letting him know that she knew he was indeed wasted. </p><p>\u201cA little. Where\u2019s H?</p><p>\u201cSleeping, and I\u2019d like for it to stay that way.,\u201d she quipped, throwing him a playfully stern look. It seemed as though he was going to retort, but he quickly looked towards the living room with a curious expression on his face. His eyes landed on the source of the music he was hearing, and he walked clumsily towards it. </p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not what I *hiccup* meant.\u201d he said, laughing at himself a little. </p><p>She chuckled and walked to stand beside him. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re called the Beastie Boys. They\u2019re rappers from New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought your didn\u2019t like rap music?\u201d he teased, knowing that anytime James had tried to make y/n listen to any MC\u2019s, she would promptly walk out of the room. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but I like them. They\u2019ve got good instrumentals they rap over.\u201d</p><p>Sirius nodded at that, sitting down on the arm of the chair she had almost fallen asleep in earlier. She sat down beside him, noticing him still staring at the record. She took this time to look at him. She couldn\u2019t remember a time she had truly looked at him since school. He was still handsome. He had cut his hair since school, deciding that it \u2018got in the way while he was driving\u2019. His eyes had grown to retrieve the playful gleam that they had lost during the time of the war. He had decided the moment the war ended that he was going to litter his body with ink. Y/n could see some peeking through the sleeve of his shirt. As she glanced back up at his face, she wondered why he was here on a night like this. </p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out with the rest of \u2018em?\u201d she asked, fiddling with her shirt. </p><p>\u201cNot much of a partier.\u201d he said, looking at her with a melancholy expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s a lie. I\u2019ve never known Sirius Black to miss out on a party, especially when he gets a guaranteed kiss at midnight.\u201d she said, her heart aching a bit at the truth of the statement. </p><p>\u201cMaybe the one I want to kiss wasn\u2019t at the party.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her eyes. He wanted nothing more than to kiss her. She shifted under his heated stare, letting her eyes trail to the clock. 2 minutes til midnight. She pushed his prior statement to the back of her mind and stood up to turn off the record, which was now softly playing Hold It Now, Hit It, and turned on the radio. </p><p>\u201cYou know I used to think you were odd in school. What with the not partying and all. I get it now though. S\u2019not very practical now.\u201d Sirius said, looking at her with a soft smile on his face. He shifted his head to look up at the ceiling. \u201cYou know I was telling the truth. You\u2019re the only person I want to kiss. Always have been. Just never thought you wanted to kiss me back. Know now though. Moony told me. Good lad. He said-\u201c </p><p>\u201cSirius, your rambling.\u201d she said, trying to dismiss the fact that he knew she indeed wanted to kiss him back. </p><p>\u201cPlease kiss me\u201d he pleaded. </p><p>\u201cSirius you\u2019re drunk.\u201d she said, earning a bored face from Sirius. </p><p>\u201cY/n you\u2019re sober. Kiss me.\u201d He hoped she would say yes more than anything. However, he knew that as long as he was drunk, he wouldn\u2019t get a kiss. </p><p>\u201cHow about this, when you wake up in the morning, if you still want to kiss me, then go for it.\u201d</p><p>Sirius pouted at her. He sprawled his body across her legs, head resting on the other arm of the chair. As the voices on the radio started counting down, Sirius\u2019 puppy dog eyes grew sadder. As the new year began, y/n leaned down and pecked Sirius on the cheek. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute Pads, you know that?\u201d she said, smiling softly at the boy that was pouting up at her. </p><p>\u201cIt just so happens I do. Now get up.\u201d he stated matter-of-factly. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up. It\u2019s time we play some real music.\u201d</p><p>Y/n scoffed at him. </p><p>\u201cMom you\u2019re just jealous it\u2019s the Beastie Boys,\u201d she muttered to herself. Sirius casted her a strange look, causing her to shake your head and look towards Harry\u2019s room, where Sirius had moved him to sleep soundly and \u2018not wake up with a bad back\u2019. She wished he was awake to understand her reference.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Remus, James, and Lily all entered the Potter home at 3 o\u2019clock. The two men were just about as drunk as Sirius, Lily having to lead them through the door. She told Remus to stay put as she helped her husband up the stairs. As the couple rounded the corner, Remus made his way into the living room. His eyes went big when he saw his two best friends asleep cuddled up together on a chair that was far too small for them. </p><p>\u201cRemus what are you- oh merlin.\u201d Lily stated, jaw dropping at the sight before her. </p><p>\u201cWhat? What? I wanna see!\u201d James announced, squeezing inbetween both of them. He glanced around the room in search of what they were looking at. When his eyes landed on his child\u2019s godparents, he quickly understood the \u2018oh merlin\u2019 statement. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Thought I said no boys.\u201d he said a bit too loudly, promptly waking up the sleeping couple. Y/n\u2019s eyes fluttered open and landed on the group standing before her with smirks on their face. She blushed and nudged her face into Sirius\u2019 chest. He looked down at her and smiled fondly. He ran a hand through her hair, glancing up at his disturbers unamusedly. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys knock?\u201d he quipped. </p><p>\u201cNot on my own door, no. Where\u2019s my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis bed.\u201d</p><p>With that, the couple turned to go check on him, seemingly not believing the pair. </p><p>Y/n chuckled and attempted to go back to sleeping in Sirius\u2019 arms. He placed two fingers under her chin, coaxing her face towards his. They were centimeters apart. Y/n could feel Sirius\u2019 breath on her face. A blush started to creep its way up her neck. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning.\u201d Sirius said, a cocky smirk on his face. He leaned in and brushed his lips against hers, looking down to see if it was alright. She looked back up at him and chuckled, bringing a hand to the back of his head and pulled him back in. The kiss was short and sweet, but it was enough to leave them a giggling mess, their foreheads pressed together. </p><p>As James stood next to Remus in the doorway, he threw a confused glance towards him, then towards the two, giggling like school girls. </p><p>\u201cAllow me to reiterate. What the hell?\u201d</p>",

But, there was no one she would rather have at her side at the start of the new year than her sweet godson that she loved dearly.</p><p>Y/n showed up at the Potter\u2019s house at around 7 o\u2019clock. She was immediately overwhelmed with the smell of Lily\u2019s perfume. She could hear James\u2019 voice coming from the kitchen. She walked to the doorway and saw Harry giggling up at his father, who was dancing to the music that was playing from Harry\u2019s toy boom box. </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes eventually met the ones of his godmother, and he went to run up and hug her, but she quickly put her finger to her lips and pointed at James. She smirked, walking up behind him and imitating his dance moves. James, too in the moment to notice, thought that Harry was really eating his dance moves up. James went to do a spin move and was surprised to see y/n standing behind him, doing the same dance he had just been doing. He shook his head, a small smile creeping up his face. </p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t been laughing at me?\u201d James asked Harry, a pout forming on his face. Harry made a thin line with his lips, solemnly shaking his head. </p><p>\u201cSorry, aunt y/n was being funnier.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019 jaw dropped and his hand flew to his chest in mock offense. Once Harry started to chuckle again, James turned around abruptly, throwing a glance over his shoulder, winking at his son. He turned back to y/n, kissing her in the cheek. </p><p>\u201cThank you so much for watching the twerp,\u201d he said, making sure the \u2018twerp\u2019 came out louder than the rest of his sentence. Harry scoffed behind him, muttering a \u201chey\u201d. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go alert the wife that you\u2019re here,\u201d he stated, turning and running up the stairs. Y/n  shook her head and smiled softly at the man who hadn\u2019t changed over the past 9 years they had been out of school for. Her head quickly jerked forward when two small arms wrapped around her and squeezed her. She smiled, laying her head on top of his and picking him up, spinning around with him in her arms. He laughed loudly, stumbling around a little when she let him down. Harry looked up at her with a mischievous grin on his face. </p><p>\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d he asked looking around to see if he could find what he was looking for. Of course y/n had brought it. They had talked about it last time she had been over, both of them knowing she would inevitably be the one to watch him on December 31st. </p><p>\u201cDid I bring what?\u201d she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion, looking down at the boy as if she was completely oblivious. Harry tilted his head to the side, unamused. He glanced at the couch and saw her bag. He looked back up at y/n and smiled, before running to the couch and fumbling through her bag. </p><p>\u201cCareful Har Bear, records break easily you know?\u201d she teased the eager boy. Harry pulled his hands out of her bag and brought them behind his back, smiling down towards the ground bashfully. Y/n reached down and started tickling the young boy. He was laughing and squirming vigorously. </p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d y/n stated, not going to stop until she made her godson surrender. </p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-ah!\u201d He tried to get out, his own involuntary shriek cutting him off. </p><p>\u201cSay it or I\u2019m not stopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not your uncle.\u201d She grinned down at the boy. </p><p>\u201cAunt! Aunt, aunt, aunt!\u201d Harry yelled, out of breath. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s very fair, y/n.\u201d an amused voice said from the doorway. \u201cUncle is the universal term for \u2018I give up\u2019. Can\u2019t just go switching the rules up on my boy like that.\u201d James stated, a smiling Lily behind him. </p><p>\u201cWell don\u2019t you two look lovely,\u201d y/n quipped, taking in the couple\u2019s appearance. She had always thought they looked good together; they were both very attractive people. </p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, y/n,\u201d lily smiled, walking over to hug her. \u201cWe should be back no later than two, but if something were to happen, we\u2019ll let you know,\u201d she said, kissing her son\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201cYou two behave. I don\u2019t want another call from Mrs. Bagshot saying it sounds like pots and pans banging together all up and down the street,\u201d James smirked, causing y/n to look down at Harry and roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI have to repeat myself everytime I talk to her. Beastie Boys are loud, but they\u2019re not that loud dad,\u201d Harry stated, earning a stern look from his mother and a proud smile from his father. The six year old\u2019s taste in music had always impressed y/n. He was very grown up for his age, obviously talking after his mother and herself. </p><p>\u201cWe shall return,\u201d James said, performing his and Harry\u2019s handshake and kissing the top of his head. </p><p>\u201cNo boys.\u201d James stated, throwing you a wink. Him and his son both started to sing their rendition of \u2018Y/n and Sirius sitting in a tree\u2019. She still wasn\u2019t sure how they all knew about her crush. They always just said it was obvious. It was just a silly crush though, y/n knew it was not realistic. A silly crush that had lasted for close to ten years. </p><p>The couple then walked out of the door, throwing out one last \u201cbehave\u201d before shutting it. </p><p>Harry turned to his godmother, tapping his foot eagerly. Her heart swelled as he reminded her so much of the marauders. They always wanted to listen to whatever records she had in her dorm, quickly becoming obsessed with the artist for a week, before moving swiftly on to another. This is exactly how Harry was. </p><p>\u201cWhich one first?\u201d she asked, already knowing the answer. She pulled out Licensed to Ill and started walking toward the turntable. Harry opened his mouth, but quickly shut it seeing that y/n had already read his mind. </p><p>He started to jump around as the first song, Rhymin and Stealin\u2019, rang throughout the house. </p><p>\u201cThis is gonna be a long night,\u201d Y/n thought before joining Harry in his dancing escapade. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Y/n thought that Harry would want to listen to the record two times tops, then switch over to some of his other favorites. She had tried to put on Rubber Soul, but Harry just wasn\u2019t having it. </p><p>It was now 10:40, and Harry was out cold. He had fallen asleep on the couch while she had gotten up to fix him some milk, hoping it might coax him into sleep. When she returned, she smiled down at the boy, reaching out for a blanket and pulling it over him. She sat down in hopes of herself being able to go to sleep too. She started to drift off, until she was jostled awake by the start of Fight For Your Right. She huffed, abruptly standing and trudging over to turn the record player off alltogether. She was interrupted by a knock on the door.  </p><p>Contemplating whether she should turn off the music or open the door first, she chose the latter. Tiptoeing towards the door in hopes of not waking Harry, her intentions were in vain when she opened the door to a very handsome, very plastered friend of hers. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Ello love. What\u2019re yah doin here?\u201d he asked, a genuine smile forming on his face. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes had a layer of gloss covering them. She smiled amusingly at him. </p><p>\u201cFawn-sitting. Are you drunk?\u201d she asked, obviously knowing the answer to her question. </p><p>Sirius laughed at the first part, only to straighten up and look at her in an attempt to tell her he was, in fact, not drunk. She raised her eyebrows at him, letting him know that she knew he was indeed wasted. </p><p>\u201cA little. Where\u2019s H?</p><p>\u201cSleeping, and I\u2019d like for it to stay that way.,\u201d she quipped, throwing him a playfully stern look. It seemed as though he was going to retort, but he quickly looked towards the living room with a curious expression on his face. His eyes landed on the source of the music he was hearing, and he walked clumsily towards it. </p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not what I *hiccup* meant.\u201d he said, laughing at himself a little. </p><p>She chuckled and walked to stand beside him. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re called the Beastie Boys. They\u2019re rappers from New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought your didn\u2019t like rap music?\u201d he teased, knowing that anytime James had tried to make y/n listen to any MC\u2019s, she would promptly walk out of the room. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but I like them. They\u2019ve got good instrumentals they rap over.\u201d</p><p>Sirius nodded at that, sitting down on the arm of the chair she had almost fallen asleep in earlier. She sat down beside him, noticing him still staring at the record. She took this time to look at him. She couldn\u2019t remember a time she had truly looked at him since school. He was still handsome. He had cut his hair since school, deciding that it \u2018got in the way while he was driving\u2019. His eyes had grown to retrieve the playful gleam that they had lost during the time of the war. He had decided the moment the war ended that he was going to litter his body with ink. Y/n could see some peeking through the sleeve of his shirt. As she glanced back up at his face, she wondered why he was here on a night like this. </p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out with the rest of \u2018em?\u201d she asked, fiddling with her shirt. </p><p>\u201cNot much of a partier.\u201d he said, looking at her with a melancholy expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s a lie. I\u2019ve never known Sirius Black to miss out on a party, especially when he gets a guaranteed kiss at midnight.\u201d she said, her heart aching a bit at the truth of the statement. </p><p>\u201cMaybe the one I want to kiss wasn\u2019t at the party.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her eyes. He wanted nothing more than to kiss her. She shifted under his heated stare, letting her eyes trail to the clock. 2 minutes til midnight. She pushed his prior statement to the back of her mind and stood up to turn off the record, which was now softly playing Hold It Now, Hit It, and turned on the radio. </p><p>\u201cYou know I used to think you were odd in school. What with the not partying and all. I get it now though. S\u2019not very practical now.\u201d Sirius said, looking at her with a soft smile on his face. He shifted his head to look up at the ceiling. \u201cYou know I was telling the truth. You\u2019re the only person I want to kiss. Always have been. Just never thought you wanted to kiss me back. Know now though. Moony told me. Good lad. He said-\u201c </p><p>\u201cSirius, your rambling.\u201d she said, trying to dismiss the fact that he knew she indeed wanted to kiss him back. </p><p>\u201cPlease kiss me\u201d he pleaded. </p><p>\u201cSirius you\u2019re drunk.\u201d she said, earning a bored face from Sirius. </p><p>\u201cY/n you\u2019re sober. Kiss me.\u201d He hoped she would say yes more than anything. However, he knew that as long as he was drunk, he wouldn\u2019t get a kiss. </p><p>\u201cHow about this, when you wake up in the morning, if you still want to kiss me, then go for it.\u201d</p><p>Sirius pouted at her. He sprawled his body across her legs, head resting on the other arm of the chair. As the voices on the radio started counting down, Sirius\u2019 puppy dog eyes grew sadder. As the new year began, y/n leaned down and pecked Sirius on the cheek. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute Pads, you know that?\u201d she said, smiling softly at the boy that was pouting up at her. </p><p>\u201cIt just so happens I do. Now get up.\u201d he stated matter-of-factly. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up. It\u2019s time we play some real music.\u201d</p><p>Y/n scoffed at him. </p><p>\u201cMom you\u2019re just jealous it\u2019s the Beastie Boys,\u201d she muttered to herself. Sirius casted her a strange look, causing her to shake your head and look towards Harry\u2019s room, where Sirius had moved him to sleep soundly and \u2018not wake up with a bad back\u2019. She wished he was awake to understand her reference.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Remus, James, and Lily all entered the Potter home at 3 o\u2019clock. The two men were just about as drunk as Sirius, Lily having to lead them through the door. She told Remus to stay put as she helped her husband up the stairs. As the couple rounded the corner, Remus made his way into the living room. His eyes went big when he saw his two best friends asleep cuddled up together on a chair that was far too small for them. </p><p>\u201cRemus what are you- oh merlin.\u201d Lily stated, jaw dropping at the sight before her. </p><p>\u201cWhat? What? I wanna see!\u201d James announced, squeezing inbetween both of them. He glanced around the room in search of what they were looking at. When his eyes landed on his child\u2019s godparents, he quickly understood the \u2018oh merlin\u2019 statement. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Thought I said no boys.\u201d he said a bit too loudly, promptly waking up the sleeping couple. Y/n\u2019s eyes fluttered open and landed on the group standing before her with smirks on their face. She blushed and nudged her face into Sirius\u2019 chest. He looked down at her and smiled fondly. He ran a hand through her hair, glancing up at his disturbers unamusedly. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys knock?\u201d he quipped. </p><p>\u201cNot on my own door, no. Where\u2019s my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis bed.\u201d</p><p>With that, the couple turned to go check on him, seemingly not believing the pair. </p><p>Y/n chuckled and attempted to go back to sleeping in Sirius\u2019 arms. He placed two fingers under her chin, coaxing her face towards his. They were centimeters apart. Y/n could feel Sirius\u2019 breath on her face. A blush started to creep its way up her neck. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning.\u201d Sirius said, a cocky smirk on his face. He leaned in and brushed his lips against hers, looking down to see if it was alright. She looked back up at him and chuckled, bringing a hand to the back of his head and pulled him back in. The kiss was short and sweet, but it was enough to leave them a giggling mess, their foreheads pressed together. </p><p>As James stood next to Remus in the doorway, he threw a confused glance towards him, then towards the two, giggling like school girls. </p><p>\u201cAllow me to reiterate. What the hell?\u201d</p></p>",

Not even in her school years had she enjoyed the rambunctious affairs that would take place in her common room. Although this has evoked much teasing from her friends, she thought that they would someday grow out of the party scene themselves. Maybe she didn\u2019t know her friends too well. </p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll watch Harry, Lils. No, not a burden at all. I\u2019ll be at your\u2019s in a few. Love you too. Bye,\u201d y/n said, putting the phone back on the receiver. She chuckled lightly to herself. Of course they were going to a party to celebrate the new year. It agitated her a bit that she hadn\u2019t called earlier. She wondered what Lily would\u2019ve done if she had plans. But, there was no one she would rather have at her side at the start of the new year than her sweet godson that she loved dearly.</p><p>Y/n showed up at the Potter\u2019s house at around 7 o\u2019clock. She was immediately overwhelmed with the smell of Lily\u2019s perfume. She could hear James\u2019 voice coming from the kitchen. She walked to the doorway and saw Harry giggling up at his father, who was dancing to the music that was playing from Harry\u2019s toy boom box. </p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes eventually met the ones of his godmother, and he went to run up and hug her, but she quickly put her finger to her lips and pointed at James. She smirked, walking up behind him and imitating his dance moves. James, too in the moment to notice, thought that Harry was really eating his dance moves up. James went to do a spin move and was surprised to see y/n standing behind him, doing the same dance he had just been doing. He shook his head, a small smile creeping up his face. </p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t been laughing at me?\u201d James asked Harry, a pout forming on his face. Harry made a thin line with his lips, solemnly shaking his head. </p><p>\u201cSorry, aunt y/n was being funnier.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019 jaw dropped and his hand flew to his chest in mock offense. Once Harry started to chuckle again, James turned around abruptly, throwing a glance over his shoulder, winking at his son. He turned back to y/n, kissing her in the cheek. </p><p>\u201cThank you so much for watching the twerp,\u201d he said, making sure the \u2018twerp\u2019 came out louder than the rest of his sentence. Harry scoffed behind him, muttering a \u201chey\u201d. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go alert the wife that you\u2019re here,\u201d he stated, turning and running up the stairs. Y/n  shook her head and smiled softly at the man who hadn\u2019t changed over the past 9 years they had been out of school for. Her head quickly jerked forward when two small arms wrapped around her and squeezed her. She smiled, laying her head on top of his and picking him up, spinning around with him in her arms. He laughed loudly, stumbling around a little when she let him down. Harry looked up at her with a mischievous grin on his face. </p><p>\u201cDid you bring it?\u201d he asked looking around to see if he could find what he was looking for. Of course y/n had brought it. They had talked about it last time she had been over, both of them knowing she would inevitably be the one to watch him on December 31st. </p><p>\u201cDid I bring what?\u201d she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion, looking down at the boy as if she was completely oblivious. Harry tilted his head to the side, unamused. He glanced at the couch and saw her bag. He looked back up at y/n and smiled, before running to the couch and fumbling through her bag. </p><p>\u201cCareful Har Bear, records break easily you know?\u201d she teased the eager boy. Harry pulled his hands out of her bag and brought them behind his back, smiling down towards the ground bashfully. Y/n reached down and started tickling the young boy. He was laughing and squirming vigorously. </p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d y/n stated, not going to stop until she made her godson surrender. </p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-ah!\u201d He tried to get out, his own involuntary shriek cutting him off. </p><p>\u201cSay it or I\u2019m not stopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not your uncle.\u201d She grinned down at the boy. </p><p>\u201cAunt! Aunt, aunt, aunt!\u201d Harry yelled, out of breath. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s very fair, y/n.\u201d an amused voice said from the doorway. \u201cUncle is the universal term for \u2018I give up\u2019. Can\u2019t just go switching the rules up on my boy like that.\u201d James stated, a smiling Lily behind him. </p><p>\u201cWell don\u2019t you two look lovely,\u201d y/n quipped, taking in the couple\u2019s appearance. She had always thought they looked good together; they were both very attractive people. </p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, y/n,\u201d lily smiled, walking over to hug her. \u201cWe should be back no later than two, but if something were to happen, we\u2019ll let you know,\u201d she said, kissing her son\u2019s forehead. </p><p>\u201cYou two behave. I don\u2019t want another call from Mrs. Bagshot saying it sounds like pots and pans banging together all up and down the street,\u201d James smirked, causing y/n to look down at Harry and roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI have to repeat myself everytime I talk to her. Beastie Boys are loud, but they\u2019re not that loud dad,\u201d Harry stated, earning a stern look from his mother and a proud smile from his father. The six year old\u2019s taste in music had always impressed y/n. He was very grown up for his age, obviously talking after his mother and herself. </p><p>\u201cWe shall return,\u201d James said, performing his and Harry\u2019s handshake and kissing the top of his head. </p><p>\u201cNo boys.\u201d James stated, throwing you a wink. Him and his son both started to sing their rendition of \u2018Y/n and Sirius sitting in a tree\u2019. She still wasn\u2019t sure how they all knew about her crush. They always just said it was obvious. It was just a silly crush though, y/n knew it was not realistic. A silly crush that had lasted for close to ten years. </p><p>The couple then walked out of the door, throwing out one last \u201cbehave\u201d before shutting it. </p><p>Harry turned to his godmother, tapping his foot eagerly. Her heart swelled as he reminded her so much of the marauders. They always wanted to listen to whatever records she had in her dorm, quickly becoming obsessed with the artist for a week, before moving swiftly on to another. This is exactly how Harry was. </p><p>\u201cWhich one first?\u201d she asked, already knowing the answer. She pulled out Licensed to Ill and started walking toward the turntable. Harry opened his mouth, but quickly shut it seeing that y/n had already read his mind. </p><p>He started to jump around as the first song, Rhymin and Stealin\u2019, rang throughout the house. </p><p>\u201cThis is gonna be a long night,\u201d Y/n thought before joining Harry in his dancing escapade. </p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Y/n thought that Harry would want to listen to the record two times tops, then switch over to some of his other favorites. She had tried to put on Rubber Soul, but Harry just wasn\u2019t having it. </p><p>It was now 10:40, and Harry was out cold. He had fallen asleep on the couch while she had gotten up to fix him some milk, hoping it might coax him into sleep. When she returned, she smiled down at the boy, reaching out for a blanket and pulling it over him. She sat down in hopes of herself being able to go to sleep too. She started to drift off, until she was jostled awake by the start of Fight For Your Right. She huffed, abruptly standing and trudging over to turn the record player off alltogether. She was interrupted by a knock on the door.  </p><p>Contemplating whether she should turn off the music or open the door first, she chose the latter. Tiptoeing towards the door in hopes of not waking Harry, her intentions were in vain when she opened the door to a very handsome, very plastered friend of hers. </p><p>\u201c\u2018Ello love. What\u2019re yah doin here?\u201d he asked, a genuine smile forming on his face. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes had a layer of gloss covering them. She smiled amusingly at him. </p><p>\u201cFawn-sitting. Are you drunk?\u201d she asked, obviously knowing the answer to her question. </p><p>Sirius laughed at the first part, only to straighten up and look at her in an attempt to tell her he was, in fact, not drunk. She raised her eyebrows at him, letting him know that she knew he was indeed wasted. </p><p>\u201cA little. Where\u2019s H?</p><p>\u201cSleeping, and I\u2019d like for it to stay that way.,\u201d she quipped, throwing him a playfully stern look. It seemed as though he was going to retort, but he quickly looked towards the living room with a curious expression on his face. His eyes landed on the source of the music he was hearing, and he walked clumsily towards it. </p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not what I *hiccup* meant.\u201d he said, laughing at himself a little. </p><p>She chuckled and walked to stand beside him. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re called the Beastie Boys. They\u2019re rappers from New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought your didn\u2019t like rap music?\u201d he teased, knowing that anytime James had tried to make y/n listen to any MC\u2019s, she would promptly walk out of the room. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but I like them. They\u2019ve got good instrumentals they rap over.\u201d</p><p>Sirius nodded at that, sitting down on the arm of the chair she had almost fallen asleep in earlier. She sat down beside him, noticing him still staring at the record. She took this time to look at him. She couldn\u2019t remember a time she had truly looked at him since school. He was still handsome. He had cut his hair since school, deciding that it \u2018got in the way while he was driving\u2019. His eyes had grown to retrieve the playful gleam that they had lost during the time of the war. He had decided the moment the war ended that he was going to litter his body with ink. Y/n could see some peeking through the sleeve of his shirt. As she glanced back up at his face, she wondered why he was here on a night like this. </p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out with the rest of \u2018em?\u201d she asked, fiddling with her shirt. </p><p>\u201cNot much of a partier.\u201d he said, looking at her with a melancholy expression on his face. </p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s a lie. I\u2019ve never known Sirius Black to miss out on a party, especially when he gets a guaranteed kiss at midnight.\u201d she said, her heart aching a bit at the truth of the statement. </p><p>\u201cMaybe the one I want to kiss wasn\u2019t at the party.\u201d</p><p>He stared into her eyes. He wanted nothing more than to kiss her. She shifted under his heated stare, letting her eyes trail to the clock. 2 minutes til midnight. She pushed his prior statement to the back of her mind and stood up to turn off the record, which was now softly playing Hold It Now, Hit It, and turned on the radio. </p><p>\u201cYou know I used to think you were odd in school. What with the not partying and all. I get it now though. S\u2019not very practical now.\u201d Sirius said, looking at her with a soft smile on his face. He shifted his head to look up at the ceiling. \u201cYou know I was telling the truth. You\u2019re the only person I want to kiss. Always have been. Just never thought you wanted to kiss me back. Know now though. Moony told me. Good lad. He said-\u201c </p><p>\u201cSirius, your rambling.\u201d she said, trying to dismiss the fact that he knew she indeed wanted to kiss him back. </p><p>\u201cPlease kiss me\u201d he pleaded. </p><p>\u201cSirius you\u2019re drunk.\u201d she said, earning a bored face from Sirius. </p><p>\u201cY/n you\u2019re sober. Kiss me.\u201d He hoped she would say yes more than anything. However, he knew that as long as he was drunk, he wouldn\u2019t get a kiss. </p><p>\u201cHow about this, when you wake up in the morning, if you still want to kiss me, then go for it.\u201d</p><p>Sirius pouted at her. He sprawled his body across her legs, head resting on the other arm of the chair. As the voices on the radio started counting down, Sirius\u2019 puppy dog eyes grew sadder. As the new year began, y/n leaned down and pecked Sirius on the cheek. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute Pads, you know that?\u201d she said, smiling softly at the boy that was pouting up at her. </p><p>\u201cIt just so happens I do. Now get up.\u201d he stated matter-of-factly. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up. It\u2019s time we play some real music.\u201d</p><p>Y/n scoffed at him. </p><p>\u201cMom you\u2019re just jealous it\u2019s the Beastie Boys,\u201d she muttered to herself. Sirius casted her a strange look, causing her to shake your head and look towards Harry\u2019s room, where Sirius had moved him to sleep soundly and \u2018not wake up with a bad back\u2019. She wished he was awake to understand her reference.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Remus, James, and Lily all entered the Potter home at 3 o\u2019clock. The two men were just about as drunk as Sirius, Lily having to lead them through the door. She told Remus to stay put as she helped her husband up the stairs. As the couple rounded the corner, Remus made his way into the living room. His eyes went big when he saw his two best friends asleep cuddled up together on a chair that was far too small for them. </p><p>\u201cRemus what are you- oh merlin.\u201d Lily stated, jaw dropping at the sight before her. </p><p>\u201cWhat? What? I wanna see!\u201d James announced, squeezing inbetween both of them. He glanced around the room in search of what they were looking at. When his eyes landed on his child\u2019s godparents, he quickly understood the \u2018oh merlin\u2019 statement. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Thought I said no boys.\u201d he said a bit too loudly, promptly waking up the sleeping couple. Y/n\u2019s eyes fluttered open and landed on the group standing before her with smirks on their face. She blushed and nudged her face into Sirius\u2019 chest. He looked down at her and smiled fondly. He ran a hand through her hair, glancing up at his disturbers unamusedly. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys knock?\u201d he quipped. </p><p>\u201cNot on my own door, no. Where\u2019s my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis bed.\u201d</p><p>With that, the couple turned to go check on him, seemingly not believing the pair. </p><p>Y/n chuckled and attempted to go back to sleeping in Sirius\u2019 arms. He placed two fingers under her chin, coaxing her face towards his. They were centimeters apart. Y/n could feel Sirius\u2019 breath on her face. A blush started to creep its way up her neck. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning.\u201d Sirius said, a cocky smirk on his face. He leaned in and brushed his lips against hers, looking down to see if it was alright. She looked back up at him and chuckled, bringing a hand to the back of his head and pulled him back in. The kiss was short and sweet, but it was enough to leave them a giggling mess, their foreheads pressed together. </p><p>As James stood next to Remus in the doorway, he threw a confused glance towards him, then towards the two, giggling like school girls. </p><p>\u201cAllow me to reiterate. What the hell?\u201d</p></p>",

Not even in her school years had she enjoyed the rambunctious affairs that would take place in her common room. Although this has evoked much teasing from her friends, she thought that they would someday grow out of the party scene themselves. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t know her friends too well. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll watch Harry, Lils. No, not a burden at all. I&rsquo;ll be at your&rsquo;s in a few. Love you too. Bye,&rdquo; y/n said, putting the phone back on the receiver. She chuckled lightly to herself. Of course they were going to a party to celebrate the new year. It agitated her a bit that she hadn&rsquo;t called earlier. She wondered what Lily would&rsquo;ve done if she had plans. But, there was no one she would rather have at her side at the start of the new year than her sweet godson that she loved dearly.</p><p>Y/n showed up at the Potter&rsquo;s house at around 7 o&rsquo;clock. She was immediately overwhelmed with the smell of Lily&rsquo;s perfume. She could hear James&rsquo; voice coming from the kitchen. She walked to the doorway and saw Harry giggling up at his father, who was dancing to the music that was playing from Harry&rsquo;s toy boom box. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes eventually met the ones of his godmother, and he went to run up and hug her, but she quickly put her finger to her lips and pointed at James. She smirked, walking up behind him and imitating his dance moves. James, too in the moment to notice, thought that Harry was really eating his dance moves up. James went to do a spin move and was surprised to see y/n standing behind him, doing the same dance he had just been doing. He shook his head, a small smile creeping up his face. </p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe five minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t been laughing at me?&rdquo; James asked Harry, a pout forming on his face. Harry made a thin line with his lips, solemnly shaking his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, aunt y/n was being funnier.&rdquo;</p><p>James&rsquo; jaw dropped and his hand flew to his chest in mock offense. Once Harry started to chuckle again, James turned around abruptly, throwing a glance over his shoulder, winking at his son. He turned back to y/n, kissing her in the cheek. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so much for watching the twerp,&rdquo; he said, making sure the &lsquo;twerp&rsquo; came out louder than the rest of his sentence. Harry scoffed behind him, muttering a &ldquo;hey&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go alert the wife that you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he stated, turning and running up the stairs. Y/n  shook her head and smiled softly at the man who hadn&rsquo;t changed over the past 9 years they had been out of school for. Her head quickly jerked forward when two small arms wrapped around her and squeezed her. She smiled, laying her head on top of his and picking him up, spinning around with him in her arms. He laughed loudly, stumbling around a little when she let him down. Harry looked up at her with a mischievous grin on his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you bring it?&rdquo; he asked looking around to see if he could find what he was looking for. Of course y/n had brought it. They had talked about it last time she had been over, both of them knowing she would inevitably be the one to watch him on December 31st. </p><p>&ldquo;Did I bring what?&rdquo; she furrowed her eyebrows in confusion, looking down at the boy as if she was completely oblivious. Harry tilted his head to the side, unamused. He glanced at the couch and saw her bag. He looked back up at y/n and smiled, before running to the couch and fumbling through her bag. </p><p>&ldquo;Careful Har Bear, records break easily you know?&rdquo; she teased the eager boy. Harry pulled his hands out of her bag and brought them behind his back, smiling down towards the ground bashfully. Y/n reached down and started tickling the young boy. He was laughing and squirming vigorously. </p><p>&ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; y/n stated, not going to stop until she made her godson surrender. </p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No-ah!&rdquo; He tried to get out, his own involuntary shriek cutting him off. </p><p>&ldquo;Say it or I&rsquo;m not stopping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;not your uncle.&rdquo; She grinned down at the boy. </p><p>&ldquo;Aunt! Aunt, aunt, aunt!&rdquo; Harry yelled, out of breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s very fair, y/n.&rdquo; an amused voice said from the doorway. &ldquo;Uncle is the universal term for &lsquo;I give up&rsquo;. Can&rsquo;t just go switching the rules up on my boy like that.&rdquo; James stated, a smiling Lily behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t you two look lovely,&rdquo; y/n quipped, taking in the couple&rsquo;s appearance.

He placed two fingers under her chin, coaxing her face towards his. They were centimeters apart. Y/n could feel Sirius&rsquo; breath on her face. A blush started to creep its way up her neck. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s morning.&rdquo; Sirius said, a cocky smirk on his face. He leaned in and brushed his lips against hers, looking down to see if it was alright. She looked back up at him and chuckled, bringing a hand to the back of his head and pulled him back in. The kiss was short and sweet, but it was enough to leave them a giggling mess, their foreheads pressed together. </p><p>As James stood next to Remus in the doorway, he threw a confused glance towards him, then towards the two, giggling like school girls. </p><p>&ldquo;Allow me to reiterate. What the hell?&rdquo;</p></p>",
