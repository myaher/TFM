I get that he has changed and grown but to say he wasn\u2019t problematic during that time is a straight up lie. He has also never apologised for any of these things while other youtubers have been dragged to hell and back for saying things that were much tamer. Yet if you call him out, phannies talk about how he\u2019s been through a lot. Haven\u2019t we all? That doesn\u2019t give him a free pass.",
        "answer": "<p>This was in response to an post where I was specifically talking about Dan\u2019s old tumblr blog and phan denials and how people saying they were problematic are mostly doing it for selfish, rather than objective, reasons, but I do agree that the phandom does tend to be overprotective of Dan and Phil, often to the point of infantilizing them, so I want to address the idea of Dan being problematic in his old videos to give my perspective. I think that Dan, like many YouTubers who make comedic videos, has definitely made jokes in the past that would be considered \u201cproblematic\u201d by certain groups of people today, but has not gotten the backlash some of his peers have received. However, rather than seeing this as something that Dan needs to be dragged for and apologize for, I think that outrage/cancel culture has gone too far in its assessment of other some other YouTubers, as it has with various celebrities and even figures in history. There are a whole host of issues specific to comedy on this topic, but for the sake of brevity, I\u2019ll stick to my biggest overall issue with the trend of labeling people problematic, which is that it takes statements out of historical and cultural context and judges them by the modern standards of a specific group of people. There is a difference between saying a concept was problematic historically and labeling a person as problematic for living by the standards of that time, in my opinion. </p><p>I don\u2019t think Dan\u2019s old videos from 2009-2012 were that out there in terms of his remarks in comparison to comedy in mainstream culture, nevermind internet culture, and when he gained wider popularity and then started targeting a younger audience with the Dan and Phil brand, he definitely adjusted the types of jokes he made to accommodate that fact, and has made a lot of effort over the years to try to be very respectful of the sensitivities of people in his audience, to the point where he is sometimes criticized for avoiding controversy at the expense of being genuine. I definitely don\u2019t think he is as \u201cwoke\u201d as some in the phandom portray him to be, a point on which I agreed with an anon in another ask, and if he made some of the jokes he made in the past today, I would really question what he was trying to achieve (I am not usually personally offended by dark humor though), but I also wouldn\u2019t say he is or really has ever been a problematic person. Personally, I am much more hesitant to apply the label of problematic to comedy in general and think it\u2019s much more important to focus on things people do and actions they take when being serious that are potentially harmful (although I don\u2019t think saying \u201cit was a joke\u201d is a valid excuse for everything), but that\u2019s getting into my opinions on comedy and that would be a whole other answer.

What\u2019s okay and what\u2019s not?</h1><p>This post has no real point and it\u2019s just me rambling so feel free to ignore. </p><p>But basically, I got to thinking about stuff like fan art, fanfiction, Fan edits and videos, stuff like that. Things that the Phandom creates and puts out onto the internet with Dan and Phil as the subject matter. And some of it is incredible! A lot of y\u2019all are super talented! But there\u2019s got to be a line somewhere, right? There must be a point that comes in which it\u2019s not appropriate to create something. But where? </p><p>Here\u2019s what I think. </p><p>If you create something, anything, be it a Phanfic or a drawing or a YouTube video discussing your Dan and Phil opinions, you should create it with the mindset that Dan and Phil <i>will</i> see it. </p><p>You want to draw that super smutty fan art? Okay, but first, think to yourself. Would I take this piece of art to a meet and greet and hand it directly to them? Would I be embarrassed if they saw this? Because if you post it publicly online, you might as well just slide it right under their front door. </p><p>The same goes for anything. You want to write a multi chapter fic about Dan getting turned into a vampire but instead of sucking blood he sucks dick to survive? Alright, but remember, Dan <i>will</i> see it. If that idea bothers you, maybe don\u2019t write the thing. Or at very least, don\u2019t publish it on the internet. </p><p>You want to film a YouTube video sitting on your bed talking in-depth about why you think phan is real? Cool. They\u2019re gonna see it. If you would be embarrassed for them to watch that video, don\u2019t post it. </p><p>I\u2019ll even use my own damn blog as an example. I sit here and run a drama/discussion blog about two dudes across the ocean who I don\u2019t know and will never meet. I can only assume they\u2019ve seen at least something I\u2019ve posted. Am I embarrassed by the thought of that? No. I\u2019m just out here sharing opinions. If Dan or Phil were bothered by what I\u2019m doing here, they are more than free to shoot me a message and the whole blog comes down. No questions asked. </p><p>So, the moral of the story here, is that it\u2019s okay to create fan works. It\u2019s alright to let your creativity out through fanfiction or fan art or fan videos or whatever else. But not everything you create will be an appropriate thing to share. Because Dan and Phil are real people with real feelings and probably don\u2019t want to see the picture you drew of them 69ing on top of a tree. </p><p>So create whatever you want. Make it as weird as you want. But just take a few minutes to really look at it, and think \u201cwould I be okay with Dan and Phil seeing this?\u201d Because if it would embarrass you, there\u2019s probably a reason for that. And the reason is that you know it\u2019s inappropriate. And if you post it online, they <i>will</i> see it. So consider that before you post. </p>",

You want to write a multi chapter fic about Dan getting turned into a vampire but instead of sucking blood he sucks dick to survive? Alright, but remember, Dan <i>will</i> see it. If that idea bothers you, maybe don\u2019t write the thing.
