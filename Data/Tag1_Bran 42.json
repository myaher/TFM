Does Jon offer it to him for \u201csaving them\u201d from the NK? Wouldn\u2019t that make Arya just as qualified, if not more, for the IT? Bran doesn\u2019t have any claims to it either; that would be either Gendry or Tyrion. I know there\u2019s no point in trying to make sense of any of this, but if this is GRRM\u2019s actual ending with King Bran - how??",
