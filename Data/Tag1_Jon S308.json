I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around why the timeline DOES work for Ned himself. Catelyn thinks at one point Ashara Dayne is Jon\u2019s mother, but surely  Ned was nowhere near Dorne and Ashara nine months before Jon was born? The \u201cWylla\u201d story seems to suffer from the same problem. Or did Ned spend a lot of time crisscrossing Westeros like a pinball during the war?",
        "answer": "<p>Ned did indeed pinball around Westeros during Robert\u2019s Rebellion, inasmuch as people can pinball around a continent without the aid of motorised transport. He started in the Eyrie, went back to Winterfell via the Fingers and White Harbour, marched south to Riverrun and then to Stoney Sept, fought at the Trident, dashed to King\u2019s Landing, from there went to Storm\u2019s End, and finally headed to Dorne. He spent a lot of time on the move, in busy camps, with lots of people coming and going around him.\u00a0</p><p>Unlike Brandon, accounted for in his grave, and Benjen, accounted for at Winterfell (and also barely old enough to be messing around with girls anyway), Ned had plenty of opportunity for a discreet quickie. With Ned refusing to name Jon\u2019s mother, it\u2019s not like anyone could check the details of his story.</p>",

He wants to punish you both for daring to show your affections for one another in his presence and humiliating him before his <i>khalasar</i>,\n but he would hate to see the pain in Dany\u2019s eyes if he killed you, \nwhich he can do easily if he so chooses. So he is going to make you an \noffer\u2026since you won the horse race, you will decide what to do with \nHaggo. The best choice would be to engage him in another duel, but this \ntime, it will be a duel to the death.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s breath caught; his eyes widening in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIf\n you are able to defeat him, then he will be willing to give up Dany as \nwell as his quest to conquer Westeros. You still have to prove to be \nworthy of being her <i>khal</i>, and who knows? You might even end up leaving Vaes Dothrak with your personal <i>khalasar</i>.\u201d</p><hr>",
