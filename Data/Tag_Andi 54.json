        "question": "I feel like 3b is gonna be ruined if they cut the wedding episodewhat do you think??",
        "answer": "<p>Ruined is too strong a term imo and I trust Josh when he said that the story will still make sense. That being said, losing an entire ep or at least enough footage to make up an entire ep, will do some damage to 3c but that damage won\u2019t be distributed evenly.\u00a0\n\n They re-shot quite a bit and they still have seven eps to work with so the damage will be mitigated somewhat but losing an hour of sleep when you think you\u2019ll be getting eight or losing 12.5% off your paycheque or 12.5% off your grade on a test isn\u2019t good by any means. The Mack family story lines will suffer the most, others won\u2019t really be affected, and in a hilarious twist of fate Cyrus and TJ\u2019s story lines will actually benefit from the show losing an ep.</p><p>Celia is probably the biggest loser from all this since most Ham scenes would have had her in them and it\u2019s clear that the original wedding in 3x18 was held according to her plan. Bex and Bowie will still get married but it will be something much more lowkey; either a Mack family only affair or maybe they re-worked the Mack family outing/Jandi get back together event in what was 3x20 to be the new wedding. A lowkey wedding actually makes much more sense for their character arcs but at the same time 3x18 was probably going to be one of the most expensive eps of the season and Snuck Farm is a gorgeous setting for an entire ep and that visual spectacle is likely why the show went with Celia\u2019s lavish wedding plan in the first place. There\u2019s a lot tied up with the wedding for the Mack family but with the re-shoots they likely were able to do them all justice even though it won\u2019t be as big and beautiful of a conclusion as it was in the original time line.\u00a0</p><p>Neither Disney nor the writers deserve any credit for it as it was a complete accident brought on by horrible unforeseen circumstances but Cyrus and TJ\u2019s story lines, both individually and as a couple, will look quite a bit better with 3x18 cut. It\u2019s not so much that anything improves with Tyrus but most other story lines get cut a bit which makes it look like Tyrus was treated more equally than they actually were in otl.\u00a0TJ didn\u2019t share any eps with Ham until the finale because TJ\u2019s story line was structured to keep him from the wedding so all of these cuts and re-shoots don\u2019t really impact his story line.</p><p>If the original wedding is cut in its entirety than this Tyrus conflict looks much less like the transparent ploy to keep him off screen until after the wedding because he\u2019s not allowed to be there than it was in otl. Even if the wedding is partially salvaged and 3x18 combined with 3x17,\u00a0 TJ\u2019s ten odd minutes of screen time spread out over seven eps is a little bit better than ten minutes spread over eight eps. And with the Muffy scenes in 3x18 lost and replaced with the new basketball C plot, Garren was only on set for seven confirmed days compared to Luke\u2019s six which brings Tyrus fairly close to Muffy in terms of screen time. And with Amber losing an ep and being down to five remaining eps, Marty with four, and TJ with three it brings all the recurring characters a little bit closer in terms of screen time.\u00a0</p><p>It makes Cyrus\u2019 story line much better that 3x18 was cut. It\u2019s telling that the only new footage they shot with Cyrus was him being on set the morning of the day they filmed the new Muffy plot, which would have been brief since Josh left SLC early that same afternoon. He obviously wouldn\u2019t have had much to do in that ep other than being the comic relief/supportive friend role we see him stuck in when TJ isn\u2019t an ep. And other than some set up for his theatre event, he probably didn\u2019t have much to do in eps 16-18, Josh wasn\u2019t even in Utah for the first two days they filmed 3x17. It would really have tarnished the show\u2019s legacy that the original wedding was a hets only affair but since Marty and Amber won\u2019t be at the new wedding and Cyrus and Buffy and Jonah may not even be there, it removes a major cause for complaint.\u00a0</p><p>With the big wedding cut it makes all the other events that remain in the season like Cyrus\u2019 theatre event or Buffy\u2019s big game a bit more important. Depending on what gets re-shuffled and when the new wedding is, we may be looking at TJ only being gone for two eps in a row rather than three, which would bring him in line with the kind of gaps Amber and Marty have been getting since they returned in S3 which would the Tyrus story line feel more balanced and again bring them a bit more in line with the straight story lines. That the show went to so much trouble to keep Tyrus apart until after the wedding and it all ended up being for nothing is pretty freaking funny imo.</p><p>It now seems that the new Muffy C plot with the pro basketball players visiting the school is a replacement for the scenes they would have had in 3x18. Which makes sense since you the show can\u2019t jump straight to the bowling alley. I think this new plot fits more in line with Buffy\u2019s character and with the dynamic we\u2019ve seen between her and Marty so it probably worked out in the end for their story line.\u00a0</p><p>That they never brought back Emily for the re-shoots shows that her role in 3x18 couldn\u2019t have been all that important for the plot or for her character arc. Whatever redemption she\u2019s getting must come in the eps before or after the wedding as must her breakup with Jonah. I highly doubt the show actually had enough plot for Amber to justify her being in six of the last eight eps, much of it was likely filler, so her being in five out of seven really won\u2019t be a loss. They brought back Asher to re-shoot the Mack family outing/Jandi get back together which the show obviously can\u2019t afford to lose, especially if it\u2019s been re-worked into the new Bexie wedding. I\u2019d imagine losing 3x18 will impact the Jandi story line in 3c but there must have been enough moments between them in the other eps to still justify Jonah singing You Girl to her in what was 3x20.\u00a0I do think most of the rest of the series will be rewarding but obviously it won\u2019t be as smooth of an ending as it could have been. The Mack family will suffer a bit but on the plus side Cyrus and TJ\u2019s story lines will age much better</p>",

        "answer": "<p>There definitely won\u2019t be any scenes where they are open with their relationship in school or in front of other students (not including their friend group). They most likely won\u2019t get together officially until the finale, which takes place at the Mack house. There weren\u2019t any scenes filmed at the school for the finale. There\u2019s a good chance that the basketball game filmed for 319 will have Tyrus-related scenes, but they won\u2019t be officially together yet and they likely won\u2019t involve many Jefferson students.\u00a0</p><p>How do I think the school would react on-screen? If Terri had been given the chance to have a fourth season, I imagine she would have shown people being mostly accepting of the relationship because they really go out of their way to not victimize the kids on the show. How do I think the school would react off-screen? Like if you were asking me how I think a middle school would react to two teenage boys being in a relationship? It would really just depend on the school, and since we don\u2019t know much about the other students at Jefferson outside of their friend group - that\u2019s kind of left open for imagination.\u00a0</p><p>As for the characters we <i>do </i>know? I can\u2019t imagine any of them having a negative reaction. Andi and Buffy would be thrilled for Cyrus, and would remain protective of him. Jonah would probably be casual, just like he was to Cyrus\u2019 coming out. Kira will ultimately be fine with it, and may even help out in getting them together. Marty would be indifferent.
