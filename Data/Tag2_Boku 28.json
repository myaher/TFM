        "body": "<p>Hey everyone, welcome to the (long awaited) Bakugou Science Bust!! In this post it\u2019s less about theories and more about finding the scientific inconsistencies in Bakugou\u2019s quirk and finding solutions in the form of mini-theories. The formatting is going along the top questions I had and the results I got. Also warning this ended up being ~1900 words long (before editing) so&hellip; yea.\u00a0</p><p>The conclusion is basically a compare and contrast of the Canon vs. Scientific Bakugou and what differences we end up with. Feel free to reblog with your own theories or reaction to this, since I really enjoy seeing your feedback.<br/></p><hr><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9bff1ae08f53a72532c468854d96a9d/tumblr_inline_pscbxpSSSp1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Before getting into the science of it, let\u2019s just recap what we know about Bakugou Katsuki. As explained in season 1, episode 7, his \u2018exploding hands\u2019 quirk stems from him sweating nitroglycerin and (somehow) being able to channel that into his explosions. Right off the bat, we already know the science will not allow him to use his quirk the way he does in the show where he uses mere \u2018concentration\u2019(?) to set off his explosions. So let\u2019s get into the specifics of his limitations.</p><h2><b>Could he actually control the explosions?</b></h2><p>Seems like a pretty easy place to start right? It\u2019s a valid question; just because he has nitroglycerin in his system doesn\u2019t mean he can actually control when or if he explodes. (Which is a bit worrying.)</p><p>The answer to this one already gives us a few inconsistencies between canon and science compliant versions of this character. Yes, he can control the explosions. If Bakugou is able to sweat nitroglycerin, he would almost always have a thin layer of explosive liquid covering his body. (It can also be assumed that, with this as his power and with puberty having already hit, he sweats a lot.)\u00a0</p><p>From there, the nitroglycerin in its liquid form can be exploded in one of two ways; heat or shock/impact. And since Bakugou obviously isn\u2019t going to rely on a lighter or Todoroki to help him out every time he needs to use his power, it can be deduced that he\u2019s using impact to create those explosions. Which leads us into our next section,\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/219cf6920207f16c4fc6b9cf72aecf0c/tumblr_inline_pscbx1xPb01wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><h2><b>How would he control his power?</b></h2><p>Going with\u00a0\u2018impact\u2019 as the match to the gasoline raises two problems for Bakugou, though. One, he canonically has way more control over his power than scientifically possible, and Two, this boy is a very short-tempered one. Adding his easy-to-anger personality to this (very literally) explosive quirk would be a huge safety issue to both him and everyone around him. Having control over the blasts is possible, but it\u2019d take effort.</p><p>So, first off, he would have to fix his anger issues and learn to not hit or slam his hands on the nearest item when something goes wrong. Along with this, he would have to avoid getting in the middle of fights as well (unless he means to use his quirk in it). He might be the most peaceful Bakugou possible, but that won\u2019t stop an explosion from getting slapped.</p><p>He\u2019d also need to wear thin but tight long sleeves and pants in order to absorb and dilute the nitroglycerin, making it less likely to explode on unavoidable impacts.\u00a0\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"358\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab34a290d50ddd562e30f4b91dd80a0c/tumblr_inline_pscbw4jva31wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"358\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/></figure><p>Now, to address the few options he has that provide at least some for of control over the explosions.\u00a0</p><p>Initially, snapping seemed like the obvious solution. Not to say that it isn\u2019t an option, since it would work to activate the nitroglycerin in his hand, and if he was snapping while flicking his wrist for more control, then it\u2019d be a totally viable option. The problem comes up when looking for actual damage to be done to the opponent. Snapping his fingers close to them would be enough to stun an enemy, but the power of the explosions he could potentially make measures around the strength of the first two firecrackers from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XspwUILPgWs\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>.</p><p>The next step I took in researching this was finding a directional way for him to clap, in order to exhibit some stronger results than the snap. (Though heads up, even at maximum power, he would not be able to naturally make the huge explosions he does in the show. The gauntlets he has though might be able to help him do that.)</p><p>There were many ways for him to, essentially, clap in order to get his blast in the intended direction, but almost all of them require at least a paragraph of explanation in order to get the idea across sans imagery.

Literally no website I went to explained where specifically the sweat glands got their ingredients. This resulted in me taking an alternate route.\u00a0</p><p>Sweat is the body\u2019s way of disposing of waste and maintaining a steady temperature (woop woop homeostasis), and it consists mostly of water and salt. Sweat glands are also found all throughout the body, hence Bakugou needing to dilute all the sweat with fabric before the excess sweat becomes a real problem.\u00a0</p><p>Since the\u00a0\u201cresearch\u201d was a lot of roughly-averaged math based on conflicting information, the answer is tentative, but generally, yes, it is possible for him to sweat nitroglycerin. The natural implication of it into his body is a separate thing, but if you replace all the water in his body with a 2 parts water 1 part nitroglycerin mixture, his body should hold up along with the nitroglycerin. Surprisingly, it holds it\u2019s chemical make-up holds its own pretty well in the face of water.</p><p>Bonus science fact that came out of this section: if the 2/1 water/nitroglycerin mixture was what was flowing through his veins, along with his sweat, his pee and spit would also be explosive. So would the water from his showers or baths since the nitroglycerin would be mixed into it.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Would he be deaf?</b></h2><p>Just going to preface this by saying I am obsessed with Deaf!Bakugou headcanons, oneshots, fics, and art because A, I love deaf representation so much, and B,\u00a0<i>it\u2019s freaking accurate the show is lying to us he would 100% be deaf and here is why-</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" data-orig-width=\"700\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ad8bd5ca25ed8b5bcf17daa888bddf1/tumblr_inline_psccmdOMSD1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" data-orig-width=\"700\"/></figure><p>According to the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, hearing loss due to exposure to sounds can begin at 85 decibels or higher. To put this in perspective, the NIDCD says that heavy traffic averages at 85 decibels and firearms average around 150 decibels. 150 decibels is also the estimated bursting point for eardrums.</p><p>It\u2019s difficult to estimate how powerful his explosions are, but I\u2019m going to use an\u00a0\u2018average pistol\u2019 for this research. I am doing this because firearms use mini explosions in order to fire the bullet, and an average pistol is just an average place to start. A .22 LR pistol falls around 152 decibels.\u00a0</p><p>Next, instead of going through all the calculations to see how large this explosion is in comparison to his would-be hand explosions, I decided to convert the mass of the bullet to liters (which is what I have his sweat measured in) and see how the two numbers compare. The bigger the number, the more explosive matter there is and the larger the explosion.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou sweats roughly .21 liters per hour, based on research on how much people sweat averagely during exercise and having him be on the upper end since he\u2019d be working out hard in order to use his quirk and have actual impact. When speaking of a .22 caliber bullet, the measurements fall around 3.1 grams. Converting that, we get .0031 liters. This number is obviously too small to compare with the caliber of explosions Bakugou is letting off. In fact, bakugou\u2019s explosions are more than <i><b>70 times</b></i> that.\u00a0</p><p>The (insane) difference between the two number shows us that Bakugou\u2019s explosions will produce a lot more sound than that of a simple pistol. Instead of being just deaf, his eardrums would be nonexistent. HIs explosions\u2019 sound might not be to the same ratio as the intensity but still.. hopefully he looses his hearing gradually over time as his explosions get more powerful, because otherwise, that\u2019d be extremely painful.</p><p><i>(Please note that this section was written before I found these blueprints showing his headpiece as having earplugs, though he would still have significant hearing loss from the explosions he does even when he\u2019s not wearing those.)</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1079\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/710f02ba657a9e4f8655a49f3185061e/tumblr_inline_pse56frrOs1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1079\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"/></figure><h2><b>Could his skin take the constant damage?</b></h2><p>The explanation for this section is less scientific and more of a theoretical hypothesis.

We already know his power grows as he does, and we know that he did use it as a child, so it just got used to it. Sort of like calluses from monkey bars.\u00a0</p><p>Going off of that assumption, it\u2019s reasonable to think that at first, with his small pops, his hands\u2019 skin was hurt but quickly grew back thicker and stronger. Because that\u2019s how the body works when it\u2019s hurt. When you burn your skin, it grows back with a different texture because it has been burned and it trying to prevent that damage from happening again. So if he\u2019s been slowly building up his skins\u2019 resistance to the explosions, he should be generally alright at this point.</p><p><i>Please remember this is just a theory written without much knowledge f burning skin and not a recommendation.

            "comment": "<p>Hey everyone, welcome to the (long awaited) Bakugou Science Bust!! In this post it\u2019s less about theories and more about finding the scientific inconsistencies in Bakugou\u2019s quirk and finding solutions in the form of mini-theories. The formatting is going along the top questions I had and the results I got. Also warning this ended up being ~1900 words long (before editing) so\u2026 yea.\u00a0</p><p>The conclusion is basically a compare and contrast of the Canon vs. Scientific Bakugou and what differences we end up with. Feel free to reblog with your own theories or reaction to this, since I really enjoy seeing your feedback.<br></p><hr><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9bff1ae08f53a72532c468854d96a9d/tumblr_inline_pscbxpSSSp1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Before getting into the science of it, let\u2019s just recap what we know about Bakugou Katsuki. As explained in season 1, episode 7, his \u2018exploding hands\u2019 quirk stems from him sweating nitroglycerin and (somehow) being able to channel that into his explosions. Right off the bat, we already know the science will not allow him to use his quirk the way he does in the show where he uses mere \u2018concentration\u2019(?) to set off his explosions. So let\u2019s get into the specifics of his limitations.</p><h2><b>Could he actually control the explosions?</b></h2><p>Seems like a pretty easy place to start right? It\u2019s a valid question; just because he has nitroglycerin in his system doesn\u2019t mean he can actually control when or if he explodes. (Which is a bit worrying.)</p><p>The answer to this one already gives us a few inconsistencies between canon and science compliant versions of this character. Yes, he can control the explosions. If Bakugou is able to sweat nitroglycerin, he would almost always have a thin layer of explosive liquid covering his body. (It can also be assumed that, with this as his power and with puberty having already hit, he sweats a lot.)\u00a0</p><p>From there, the nitroglycerin in its liquid form can be exploded in one of two ways; heat or shock/impact. And since Bakugou obviously isn\u2019t going to rely on a lighter or Todoroki to help him out every time he needs to use his power, it can be deduced that he\u2019s using impact to create those explosions. Which leads us into our next section,\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/219cf6920207f16c4fc6b9cf72aecf0c/tumblr_inline_pscbx1xPb01wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><h2><b>How would he control his power?</b></h2><p>Going with\u00a0\u2018impact\u2019 as the match to the gasoline raises two problems for Bakugou, though. One, he canonically has way more control over his power than scientifically possible, and Two, this boy is a very short-tempered one. Adding his easy-to-anger personality to this (very literally) explosive quirk would be a huge safety issue to both him and everyone around him. Having control over the blasts is possible, but it\u2019d take effort.</p><p>So, first off, he would have to fix his anger issues and learn to not hit or slam his hands on the nearest item when something goes wrong. Along with this, he would have to avoid getting in the middle of fights as well (unless he means to use his quirk in it). He might be the most peaceful Bakugou possible, but that won\u2019t stop an explosion from getting slapped.</p><p>He\u2019d also need to wear thin but tight long sleeves and pants in order to absorb and dilute the nitroglycerin, making it less likely to explode on unavoidable impacts.\u00a0\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"358\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab34a290d50ddd562e30f4b91dd80a0c/tumblr_inline_pscbw4jva31wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"358\" data-orig-width=\"640\"></figure><p>Now, to address the few options he has that provide at least some for of control over the explosions.\u00a0</p><p>Initially, snapping seemed like the obvious solution.

In this post it\u2019s less about theories and more about finding the scientific inconsistencies in Bakugou\u2019s quirk and finding solutions in the form of mini-theories. The formatting is going along the top questions I had and the results I got. Also warning this ended up being ~1900 words long (before editing) so\u2026 yea.\u00a0</p><p>The conclusion is basically a compare and contrast of the Canon vs. Scientific Bakugou and what differences we end up with. Feel free to reblog with your own theories or reaction to this, since I really enjoy seeing your feedback.<br></p><hr><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9bff1ae08f53a72532c468854d96a9d/tumblr_inline_pscbxpSSSp1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Before getting into the science of it, let\u2019s just recap what we know about Bakugou Katsuki. As explained in season 1, episode 7, his \u2018exploding hands\u2019 quirk stems from him sweating nitroglycerin and (somehow) being able to channel that into his explosions. Right off the bat, we already know the science will not allow him to use his quirk the way he does in the show where he uses mere \u2018concentration\u2019(?) to set off his explosions. So let\u2019s get into the specifics of his limitations.</p><h2><b>Could he actually control the explosions?</b></h2><p>Seems like a pretty easy place to start right? It\u2019s a valid question; just because he has nitroglycerin in his system doesn\u2019t mean he can actually control when or if he explodes. (Which is a bit worrying.)</p><p>The answer to this one already gives us a few inconsistencies between canon and science compliant versions of this character. Yes, he can control the explosions. If Bakugou is able to sweat nitroglycerin, he would almost always have a thin layer of explosive liquid covering his body. (It can also be assumed that, with this as his power and with puberty having already hit, he sweats a lot.)\u00a0</p><p>From there, the nitroglycerin in its liquid form can be exploded in one of two ways; heat or shock/impact. And since Bakugou obviously isn\u2019t going to rely on a lighter or Todoroki to help him out every time he needs to use his power, it can be deduced that he\u2019s using impact to create those explosions. Which leads us into our next section,\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/219cf6920207f16c4fc6b9cf72aecf0c/tumblr_inline_pscbx1xPb01wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><h2><b>How would he control his power?</b></h2><p>Going with\u00a0\u2018impact\u2019 as the match to the gasoline raises two problems for Bakugou, though. One, he canonically has way more control over his power than scientifically possible, and Two, this boy is a very short-tempered one. Adding his easy-to-anger personality to this (very literally) explosive quirk would be a huge safety issue to both him and everyone around him. Having control over the blasts is possible, but it\u2019d take effort.</p><p>So, first off, he would have to fix his anger issues and learn to not hit or slam his hands on the nearest item when something goes wrong. Along with this, he would have to avoid getting in the middle of fights as well (unless he means to use his quirk in it). He might be the most peaceful Bakugou possible, but that won\u2019t stop an explosion from getting slapped.</p><p>He\u2019d also need to wear thin but tight long sleeves and pants in order to absorb and dilute the nitroglycerin, making it less likely to explode on unavoidable impacts.\u00a0\n</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"358\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab34a290d50ddd562e30f4b91dd80a0c/tumblr_inline_pscbw4jva31wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"358\" data-orig-width=\"640\"></figure><p>Now, to address the few options he has that provide at least some for of control over the explosions.\u00a0</p><p>Initially, snapping seemed like the obvious solution. Not to say that it isn\u2019t an option, since it would work to activate the nitroglycerin in his hand, and if he was snapping while flicking his wrist for more control, then it\u2019d be a totally viable option. The problem comes up when looking for actual damage to be done to the opponent. Snapping his fingers close to them would be enough to stun an enemy, but the power of the explosions he could potentially make measures around the strength of the first two firecrackers from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XspwUILPgWs\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>.</p><p>The next step I took in researching this was finding a directional way for him to clap, in order to exhibit some stronger results than the snap. (Though heads up, even at maximum power, he would not be able to naturally make the huge explosions he does in the show. The gauntlets he has though might be able to help him do that.)</p><p>There were many ways for him to, essentially, clap in order to get his blast in the intended direction, but almost all of them require at least a paragraph of explanation in order to get the idea across sans imagery. There is one that came to me almost immediately; it\u2019s from a theater game called Zip Zap Zop. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VYyNNf4Gdx8\" target=\"_blank\">This video</a> demonstrates the clap pretty well.\u00a0</p><p>With the impact of his fingers on his palm, the majority of the nitroglycerin would be on the palm, therefore igniting it and allowing it to go in a specific direction as he slides his exploding hand forward.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"450\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a5efef4d99cabd9930fa575603166c3/tumblr_inline_pscbuxyoYr1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"450\" data-orig-width=\"800\"></figure><h2><b>Sweating Nitroglycerin???</b></h2><p>So this part of the research was a lot harder than literally any of the rest of it because in every diagram I found, the sweat glands weren\u2019t connected to anything. Literally no website I went to explained where specifically the sweat glands got their ingredients. This resulted in me taking an alternate route.\u00a0</p><p>Sweat is the body\u2019s way of disposing of waste and maintaining a steady temperature (woop woop homeostasis), and it consists mostly of water and salt. Sweat glands are also found all throughout the body, hence Bakugou needing to dilute all the sweat with fabric before the excess sweat becomes a real problem.\u00a0</p><p>Since the\u00a0\u201cresearch\u201d was a lot of roughly-averaged math based on conflicting information, the answer is tentative, but generally, yes, it is possible for him to sweat nitroglycerin. The natural implication of it into his body is a separate thing, but if you replace all the water in his body with a 2 parts water 1 part nitroglycerin mixture, his body should hold up along with the nitroglycerin. Surprisingly, it holds it\u2019s chemical make-up holds its own pretty well in the face of water.</p><p>Bonus science fact that came out of this section: if the 2/1 water/nitroglycerin mixture was what was flowing through his veins, along with his sweat, his pee and spit would also be explosive. So would the water from his showers or baths since the nitroglycerin would be mixed into it.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Would he be deaf?</b></h2><p>Just going to preface this by saying I am obsessed with Deaf!Bakugou headcanons, oneshots, fics, and art because A, I love deaf representation so much, and B,\u00a0<i>it\u2019s freaking accurate the show is lying to us he would 100% be deaf and here is why-</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" data-orig-width=\"700\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ad8bd5ca25ed8b5bcf17daa888bddf1/tumblr_inline_psccmdOMSD1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" data-orig-width=\"700\"></figure><p>According to the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, hearing loss due to exposure to sounds can begin at 85 decibels or higher. To put this in perspective, the NIDCD says that heavy traffic averages at 85 decibels and firearms average around 150 decibels. 150 decibels is also the estimated bursting point for eardrums.</p><p>It\u2019s difficult to estimate how powerful his explosions are, but I\u2019m going to use an\u00a0\u2018average pistol\u2019 for this research. I am doing this because firearms use mini explosions in order to fire the bullet, and an average pistol is just an average place to start. A .22 LR pistol falls around 152 decibels.\u00a0</p><p>Next, instead of going through all the calculations to see how large this explosion is in comparison to his would-be hand explosions, I decided to convert the mass of the bullet to liters (which is what I have his sweat measured in) and see how the two numbers compare. The bigger the number, the more explosive matter there is and the larger the explosion.\u00a0</p><p>Bakugou sweats roughly .21 liters per hour, based on research on how much people sweat averagely during exercise and having him be on the upper end since he\u2019d be working out hard in order to use his quirk and have actual impact. When speaking of a .22 caliber bullet, the measurements fall around 3.1 grams. Converting that, we get .0031 liters. This number is obviously too small to compare with the caliber of explosions Bakugou is letting off. In fact, bakugou\u2019s explosions are more than <i><b>70 times</b></i> that.\u00a0</p><p>The (insane) difference between the two number shows us that Bakugou\u2019s explosions will produce a lot more sound than that of a simple pistol. Instead of being just deaf, his eardrums would be nonexistent. HIs explosions\u2019 sound might not be to the same ratio as the intensity but still.. hopefully he looses his hearing gradually over time as his explosions get more powerful, because otherwise, that\u2019d be extremely painful.</p><p><i>(Please note that this section was written before I found these blueprints showing his headpiece as having earplugs, though he would still have significant hearing loss from the explosions he does even when he\u2019s not wearing those.)</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1079\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/710f02ba657a9e4f8655a49f3185061e/tumblr_inline_pse56frrOs1wan7hh_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1079\" data-orig-width=\"1920\"></figure><h2><b>Could his skin take the constant damage?</b></h2><p>The explanation for this section is less scientific and more of a theoretical hypothesis. There is also a second theory I have that helps defend this question, but I\u2019m probably going to make that its own post. (If I do I\u2019ll come back and link it here.)</p><p>Anyways, I think he just used simple endurance training.</p><p>It might seem random but the chances that his skin just built up strength over the years of constant, slowly growing damage being done to them. We already know his power grows as he does, and we know that he did use it as a child, so it just got used to it. Sort of like calluses from monkey bars.\u00a0</p><p>Going off of that assumption, it\u2019s reasonable to think that at first, with his small pops, his hands\u2019 skin was hurt but quickly grew back thicker and stronger. Because that\u2019s how the body works when it\u2019s hurt. When you burn your skin, it grows back with a different texture because it has been burned and it trying to prevent that damage from happening again. So if he\u2019s been slowly building up his skins\u2019 resistance to the explosions, he should be generally alright at this point.</p><p><i>Please remember this is just a theory written without much knowledge f burning skin and not a recommendation. Do not try this at home. :)</i></p><hr><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><b></b></p><h4></h4><h4>Scientific Bakugou:</h4><ol><li>Whenever he needs to use his quirk, he either claps, snaps, or hits the object he\u2019s aiming for.</li><li>In order to avoid accidental explosions, he avoids sharp, impactful movements (smacking, hitting, or slamming things.)</li><li>He normally wears thin, lightweight long sleeves along with generally snug pants in order to absorb the excess sweat on his body for his safety and others.</li><li>When he sweats, he\u2019s sweating a mixture of nitroglycerin and water.\u00a0</li><li>His spit and pee are also explosive.\u00a0</li><li>His hearing is gone completely once he hits highschool, as his explosions reach well over 150 decibels on a regular basis.</li><li>The skin on his hands has (possibly) built up burn-calluses from the explosions over the years, growing in strength as the explosions do. It still hurts but the nerve damage is enough to prevent it from being too painful.</li></ol><h4>Canon Bakugou:*</h4><ol><li><p>Whenever he needs to use his quirk, he somehow charges the nitroglycerin in his hand via concentration. ?</p></li><li><p>In order to avoid accidental explosions, he tries to keep control over his nerves, since that seems to be what causes him to loose control and accidentally release some pops. </p></li><li><p>He normally wears loose fitting pants and a tank top <strike>because apparently he does not fear science. </strike></p></li><li><p>When he sweats, he\u2019s sweating nitroglycerin. </p></li><li><p>His spit and pee might be explosive but are probably not.</p></li><li><p>His hearing is just fine with barely any noticeable damage at all, despite the decibels he is constantly being exposed to. </p></li><li><p>The skin on his hands is normal and undamaged. <i>(Bonus science inconsistency is that he wears gloves in his hero costume, which would mute his power completely. If he even managed to make an explosion in those things, they seem to be explosion resistant, so it\u2019d do more damage to him than anything/one else.)</i></p></li></ol><p>*I think it should be noted that canon Bakugou\u2019s power seems to be tied to his emotions, which I only noticed as I was writing this.</p><hr><h2><b>Outro</b></h2><p>Despite how long it took, I really had a lot of fun with this project. I\u2019m tempted to make this into a series, possibly doing Creati / Yao-Momo next. I also have a few things I mentioned in the post above that might be part two, three, four, etc.s to this post, but going in the direction of further exploring Bakugou\u2019s abilities. Still need help on deciding which part two option to focus on first though.\u00a0</p><p>Possible part two\u2019s include:\u00a0</p><ol><li>another post like this but shorter and about his gauntlets (and hero costume in general, this would probably go more in depth on what he wears in general as well)</li><li>a post like this that follows up on my rising question of\u00a0\u2018could he actually control the explosions with neither of the triggers of nitroglycerin\u2019 and going into what other explosive he\u2019d have to use in order to have that chemical interact with the ones flowing through his system (i.e. hormones and nerves-)</li><li>a follow up on the fact that I didn\u2019t actually complete the research on his hands being able to / not able to withstand all the explosions over the years</li><li>a post dedicated to my mini-theory about bnha having one consistent mutation over everyone who has a quirk</li></ol><p>Also the art in the deaf!bakugou section doesn\u2019t have a signature on it and when I reverse image searched it the only account I could find that possibly made it was <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVQnIqkn3bkuLWWPZLw_SHg\" target=\"_blank\">@maelstrom-prince</a>.

HIs explosions&rsquo; sound might not be to the same ratio as the intensity but still.. hopefully he looses his hearing gradually over time as his explosions get more powerful, because otherwise, that&rsquo;d be extremely painful.</p><p><i>(Please note that this section was written before I found these blueprints showing his headpiece as having earplugs, though he would still have significant hearing loss from the explosions he does even when he&rsquo;s not wearing those.)</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/710f02ba657a9e4f8655a49f3185061e/tumblr_inline_pse56frrOs1wan7hh_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>Could his skin take the constant damage?</b></h2><p>The explanation for this section is less scientific and more of a theoretical hypothesis. There is also a second theory I have that helps defend this question, but I&rsquo;m probably going to make that its own post. (If I do I&rsquo;ll come back and link it here.)</p><p>Anyways, I think he just used simple endurance training.</p><p>It might seem random but the chances that his skin just built up strength over the years of constant, slowly growing damage being done to them. We already know his power grows as he does, and we know that he did use it as a child, so it just got used to it. Sort of like calluses from monkey bars.&nbsp;</p><p>Going off of that assumption, it&rsquo;s reasonable to think that at first, with his small pops, his hands&rsquo; skin was hurt but quickly grew back thicker and stronger. Because that&rsquo;s how the body works when it&rsquo;s hurt. When you burn your skin, it grows back with a different texture because it has been burned and it trying to prevent that damage from happening again. So if he&rsquo;s been slowly building up his skins&rsquo; resistance to the explosions, he should be generally alright at this point.</p><p><i>Please remember this is just a theory written without much knowledge f burning skin and not a recommendation. Do not try this at home. :)</i></p><hr /><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><b></b></p><h4></h4><h4>Scientific Bakugou:</h4><ol><li>Whenever he needs to use his quirk, he either claps, snaps, or hits the object he&rsquo;s aiming for.</li><li>In order to avoid accidental explosions, he avoids sharp, impactful movements (smacking, hitting, or slamming things.)</li><li>He normally wears thin, lightweight long sleeves along with generally snug pants in order to absorb the excess sweat on his body for his safety and others.</li><li>When he sweats, he&rsquo;s sweating a mixture of nitroglycerin and water.&nbsp;</li><li>His spit and pee are also explosive.&nbsp;</li><li>His hearing is gone completely once he hits highschool, as his explosions reach well over 150 decibels on a regular basis.</li><li>The skin on his hands has (possibly) built up burn-calluses from the explosions over the years, growing in strength as the explosions do. It still hurts but the nerve damage is enough to prevent it from being too painful.</li></ol><h4>Canon Bakugou:*</h4><ol><li><p>Whenever he needs to use his quirk, he somehow charges the nitroglycerin in his hand via concentration. ?</p></li><li><p>In order to avoid accidental explosions, he tries to keep control over his nerves, since that seems to be what causes him to loose control and accidentally release some pops. </p></li><li><p>He normally wears loose fitting pants and a tank top <strike>because apparently he does not fear science. </strike></p></li><li><p>When he sweats, he&rsquo;s sweating nitroglycerin. </p></li><li><p>His spit and pee might be explosive but are probably not.</p></li><li><p>His hearing is just fine with barely any noticeable damage at all, despite the decibels he is constantly being exposed to. </p></li><li><p>The skin on his hands is normal and undamaged. <i>(Bonus science inconsistency is that he wears gloves in his hero costume, which would mute his power completely. If he even managed to make an explosion in those things, they seem to be explosion resistant, so it&rsquo;d do more damage to him than anything/one else.)</i></p></li></ol><p>*I think it should be noted that canon Bakugou&rsquo;s power seems to be tied to his emotions, which I only noticed as I was writing this.</p><hr /><h2><b>Outro</b></h2><p>Despite how long it took, I really had a lot of fun with this project. I&rsquo;m tempted to make this into a series, possibly doing Creati / Yao-Momo next. I also have a few things I mentioned in the post above that might be part two, three, four, etc.s to this post, but going in the direction of further exploring Bakugou&rsquo;s abilities. Still need help on deciding which part two option to focus on first though.&nbsp;</p><p>Possible part two&rsquo;s include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>another post like this but shorter and about his gauntlets (and hero costume in general, this would probably go more in depth on what he wears in general as well)</li><li>a post like this that follows up on my rising question of&nbsp;&lsquo;could he actually control the explosions with neither of the triggers of nitroglycerin&rsquo; and going into what other explosive he&rsquo;d have to use in order to have that chemical interact with the ones flowing through his system (i.e. hormones and nerves-)</li><li>a follow up on the fact that I didn&rsquo;t actually complete the research on his hands being able to / not able to withstand all the explosions over the years</li><li>a post dedicated to my mini-theory about bnha having one consistent mutation over everyone who has a quirk</li></ol><p>Also the art in the deaf!bakugou section doesn&rsquo;t have a signature on it and when I reverse image searched it the only account I could find that possibly made it was <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVQnIqkn3bkuLWWPZLw_SHg\" target=\"_blank\">@maelstrom-prince</a>. So much freaking respect to whoever made it though, I freaking love blueprints for fictional things.&nbsp;</p>",
