Peter kept to himself and knew when to speak and when not to, he knew what was right and what was wrong, he was smart and only had about three real good friends.  </p><p>It took peter parker months to finally spit out a sentence to you. You had caught him staring at you a few times but peter knew his experience with girls. Liz Allen was his last girlfriend, well not girlfriend, He went to the dance with her and left halfway through. Girl before Liz was in 8th grade, he met her at a summer camp, She was pretty and kissed peter for the first time. Peter has never kissed a girl since. Not a single game of spin the bottle or seven minutes in Heaven could change that because he didn\u2019t want to kiss a girl he didn\u2019t like. </p><p>   What got even harder was when you started to sit with peters friends at lunch, you were starting to become best friends with MJ and Betty had quickly joined the group being Ned\u2019s girlfriend. Which made peter even more scared to talk to you because now you were so close to him yet he thought he could screw up so easily. </p><p>Peter liked you a lot, god did he like you a lot, he liked every thing about you. Small things you wouldn\u2019t even notice yourself, he liked the way you got pen marks on your legs when you were wearing shorts or a skirt, he liked how much you loved animals and would stop for any dog on the street even if you weren\u2019t allowed to let it, He especially loved the way you got frustrated, you\u2019d scream at the worksheet and then try harder to be smarter then a piece of paper. </p><p>It had been two months in your relationship and You hadn\u2019t kissed peter yet, but you understood if he wasn\u2019t ready. He didn\u2019t like rushing into things and you liked that. There were so many things you liked about peter that he didn\u2019t know yet. You liked that he kept every sticky note with a message you wrote for him on it, You liked how he got all red when you complemented him, it was so adorable when he started to tap his pencil and then catch himself by placing his hand over the hand doing the action. </p><p>You now sat on peters bunk bed and stared at the history notes you dreaded, peter sat at his desk, tapping his pencil, and watched some video on how to properly balance the equation he\u2019s been stuck on.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You groaned as you now hung your head off his bed. You were exhausted and wanted to do something outside of the small apartment. It was a nice Sunday yet you and peter locked yourselves in.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He looked over to see you acting dead.</p><p>\u201cCan we do something today?\u201d You asked, he looked up as he thought trying to think of what you could do.</p><p>\u201cWe could watch a movie\u2014\u201c before he could finish you groaned as your response of not wanting to do that. </p><p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s so sunny and nice! Why can\u2019t we go outside? We could get hot chocolate!\u201d You suggest with excitement, peter thought about it and then nodded. </p><p>\u201cIn spring?\u201d He asked and you nodded excitedly, you could already imagine yourself walking with peter down the road into the coffee shop that served hot chocolate with a thick layer of whipped cream and cinnamon on top with a piece of dark chocolate to melt into it. Your mouth watered at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cYes peter, hot chocolate in the spring. It sounds amazing could we please!\u201d You asked like a child and peter shut his chemistry book and took out his headphones before shoving his phone in his back pocket. </p><p>\u201cI guess, but when we get home we have to study!\u201d He stands up stretching his back out before you quickly jumped up and grabbed your shoes to quickly leave the house. </p><p>When you got the the small coffee house you were quickly met with other students\u2014mostly college\u2014people on dates enjoying a cup of coffee on a nice Sunday morning. </p><p>When you ordered peter quickly pulled out cash before you, he threw the ten dollar bill on the counter before you could. You quickly thanked him by placing a kiss on his cheek as his hand gripped tighter into yours as you did so. Peter really wanted to kiss you and show you off to the world but he was afraid of everything and if someone knew he was Spider-Man that\u2019s put you in danger. </p><p>With hands intertwined and cups in the other, You and peter walked out and started to make your direction towards Central Park. He held you close to his body feeling more comfortable then he did when you first started dating two months ago.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;I swear she was about to burn her hair off it was the funniest thing ever! But luckily MJ still has all her hair.\u201d You tell the story of lab last week where MJ nearly burned her hair. Peter heard this story, from you and MJ both but he he enjoyed watching you get excited over a story again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even want to imagine MJ bald.\u201d He laughed and you did too, you looked over at him and saw how he had whipped cream in the corner of his mouth. This was your moment, you and peter would kiss.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d You stop and turn to him. \u201cYou have something right here.\u201d You took the pad of your thumb and wiped off the cream from the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Peter looked down at your thumb as you wiped the cream on your pant leg, you were so close to him, his hand tightened again as he wanted to pull you into him but that\u2019d be inappropriate because people were around, aunt may always told him if he doesn\u2019t like pda then he shouldn\u2019t do it. But he wanted to hold your cheek and kiss your lips that probably tasted like chocolates.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d You look up at him looking for another excuse to touch his lips.</p><p>\u201cMhm?\u201d He looked into your eyes, he could already feel himself getting nervous. His first real kiss with a girl he really liked! This wasn\u2019t 8th grade \u2018peck on the lips before I head up to my bunk\u2019. This was You, you were so much to peter and all he wanted was you.</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s still some more.\u201d You tried to be discreet but peter caught on. He didn\u2019t want to wait anymore, he couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He pulled you by your hand into his lips. He was absolutely right, you did taste like chocolates and cream, with the hint of cinnamon. Your lips were warm and soft from the drink but he\u2019d hope they\u2019d always be warm and soft for him. </p><p>It was the same for you, he had soft warm lips that tasted of chocolate, cream was mostly what you tasted because peter loved whipped cream and always asked for extra. He let his hand go as he now relaxed and got more comfortable, he put his hand on your face as your hand went to grip his jacket and pull him in. </p><p>The kiss only lasted about 15 seconds, peter pulled off first but You whimpered for more as you wanted peters lips to be on your all the time.</p><p>\u201cI hope that wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d You apologized but peter shook his head quickly as he gulped still nervous.</p><p>\u201cNo! You were great,\u201d he lets go of your cheek and let\u2019s it fall to your waist. \u201cI mean, last time I kissed someone was in the 8th grade so I hope you didn\u2019t hate what I did.\u201d He presses his lips into a fine line.</p><p>\u201cMy last kiss was never, so I hope that was good.\u201d You laugh a little and peter looks at you with wide eyes. How could someone as beautiful as you not get kissed. </p><p>\u201cH-How?\u201d He stuttered out and you didn\u2019t understand what he meant. \u201cH-how did no one kiss you?\u201d He asked, his eyes were wide as he wanted to kiss you again and again to make up for all the years he could&rsquo;ve had you but didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>\u201cNever crossed anyone&rsquo;s mind i guess.\u201d You told him, Peter was lost but got this sudden burst of confidence to kiss you again.He placed his lips on yours again and this time pulled you closer by putting his hands on your waist. It was the same taste as last time, whipped cream and chocolate.  </p><p>\u201cMaybe we should head back?\u201d He offered not exactly knowing what happens after two people kiss. You blush and shake your head, you wanted to stay away from the books and stay close to peter for a little longer.</p><p>\u201cOr we can stay in the park a little longer?\u201d You plead and he smiles and nods with his brown curls flopping somewhat down in his face. You push the fallen ones back and start to walk again with him. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t wait until there were more kisses, good morning kisses, goodbye kisses, gookluck kisses, I miss you kisses, you knew any kiss with peter Parker would be amazing even if he didn\u2019t taste like chocolate all the time.</p>",

Peter kept to himself and knew when to speak and when not to, he knew what was right and what was wrong, he was smart and only had about three real good friends.  </p><p>It took peter parker months to finally spit out a sentence to you. You had caught him staring at you a few times but peter knew his experience with girls. Liz Allen was his last girlfriend, well not girlfriend, He went to the dance with her and left halfway through. Girl before Liz was in 8th grade, he met her at a summer camp, She was pretty and kissed peter for the first time. Peter has never kissed a girl since. Not a single game of spin the bottle or seven minutes in Heaven could change that because he didn\u2019t want to kiss a girl he didn\u2019t like. </p><p>   What got even harder was when you started to sit with peters friends at lunch, you were starting to become best friends with MJ and Betty had quickly joined the group being Ned\u2019s girlfriend. Which made peter even more scared to talk to you because now you were so close to him yet he thought he could screw up so easily. </p><p>Peter liked you a lot, god did he like you a lot, he liked every thing about you. Small things you wouldn\u2019t even notice yourself, he liked the way you got pen marks on your legs when you were wearing shorts or a skirt, he liked how much you loved animals and would stop for any dog on the street even if you weren\u2019t allowed to let it, He especially loved the way you got frustrated, you\u2019d scream at the worksheet and then try harder to be smarter then a piece of paper. </p><p>It had been two months in your relationship and You hadn\u2019t kissed peter yet, but you understood if he wasn\u2019t ready. He didn\u2019t like rushing into things and you liked that. There were so many things you liked about peter that he didn\u2019t know yet. You liked that he kept every sticky note with a message you wrote for him on it, You liked how he got all red when you complemented him, it was so adorable when he started to tap his pencil and then catch himself by placing his hand over the hand doing the action. </p><p>You now sat on peters bunk bed and stared at the history notes you dreaded, peter sat at his desk, tapping his pencil, and watched some video on how to properly balance the equation he\u2019s been stuck on.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You groaned as you now hung your head off his bed. You were exhausted and wanted to do something outside of the small apartment. It was a nice Sunday yet you and peter locked yourselves in.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He looked over to see you acting dead.</p><p>\u201cCan we do something today?\u201d You asked, he looked up as he thought trying to think of what you could do.</p><p>\u201cWe could watch a movie\u2014\u201c before he could finish you groaned as your response of not wanting to do that. </p><p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s so sunny and nice! Why can\u2019t we go outside? We could get hot chocolate!\u201d You suggest with excitement, peter thought about it and then nodded. </p><p>\u201cIn spring?\u201d He asked and you nodded excitedly, you could already imagine yourself walking with peter down the road into the coffee shop that served hot chocolate with a thick layer of whipped cream and cinnamon on top with a piece of dark chocolate to melt into it. Your mouth watered at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cYes peter, hot chocolate in the spring.

It was the same taste as last time, whipped cream and chocolate.  </p><p>\u201cMaybe we should head back?\u201d He offered not exactly knowing what happens after two people kiss. You blush and shake your head, you wanted to stay away from the books and stay close to peter for a little longer.</p><p>\u201cOr we can stay in the park a little longer?\u201d You plead and he smiles and nods with his brown curls flopping somewhat down in his face. You push the fallen ones back and start to walk again with him. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t wait until there were more kisses, good morning kisses, goodbye kisses, gookluck kisses, I miss you kisses, you knew any kiss with peter Parker would be amazing even if he didn\u2019t taste like chocolate all the time.</p></p>",

Peter kept to himself and knew when to speak and when not to, he knew what was right and what was wrong, he was smart and only had about three real good friends.  </p><p>It took peter parker months to finally spit out a sentence to you. You had caught him staring at you a few times but peter knew his experience with girls. Liz Allen was his last girlfriend, well not girlfriend, He went to the dance with her and left halfway through. Girl before Liz was in 8th grade, he met her at a summer camp, She was pretty and kissed peter for the first time. Peter has never kissed a girl since. Not a single game of spin the bottle or seven minutes in Heaven could change that because he didn&rsquo;t want to kiss a girl he didn&rsquo;t like. </p><p>   What got even harder was when you started to sit with peters friends at lunch, you were starting to become best friends with MJ and Betty had quickly joined the group being Ned&rsquo;s girlfriend. Which made peter even more scared to talk to you because now you were so close to him yet he thought he could screw up so easily. </p><p>Peter liked you a lot, god did he like you a lot, he liked every thing about you. Small things you wouldn&rsquo;t even notice yourself, he liked the way you got pen marks on your legs when you were wearing shorts or a skirt, he liked how much you loved animals and would stop for any dog on the street even if you weren&rsquo;t allowed to let it, He especially loved the way you got frustrated, you&rsquo;d scream at the worksheet and then try harder to be smarter then a piece of paper. </p><p>It had been two months in your relationship and You hadn&rsquo;t kissed peter yet, but you understood if he wasn&rsquo;t ready. He didn&rsquo;t like rushing into things and you liked that. There were so many things you liked about peter that he didn&rsquo;t know yet. You liked that he kept every sticky note with a message you wrote for him on it, You liked how he got all red when you complemented him, it was so adorable when he started to tap his pencil and then catch himself by placing his hand over the hand doing the action. </p><p>You now sat on peters bunk bed and stared at the history notes you dreaded, peter sat at his desk, tapping his pencil, and watched some video on how to properly balance the equation he&rsquo;s been stuck on.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; You groaned as you now hung your head off his bed. You were exhausted and wanted to do something outside of the small apartment. It was a nice Sunday yet you and peter locked yourselves in.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; He looked over to see you acting dead.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we do something today?&rdquo; You asked, he looked up as he thought trying to think of what you could do.</p><p>&ldquo;We could watch a movie&mdash;&ldquo; before he could finish you groaned as your response of not wanting to do that. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter, it&rsquo;s so sunny and nice! Why can&rsquo;t we go outside? We could get hot chocolate!&rdquo; You suggest with excitement, peter thought about it and then nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;In spring?&rdquo; He asked and you nodded excitedly, you could already imagine yourself walking with peter down the road into the coffee shop that served hot chocolate with a thick layer of whipped cream and cinnamon on top with a piece of dark chocolate to melt into it. Your mouth watered at the thought of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes peter, hot chocolate in the spring. It sounds amazing could we please!&rdquo; You asked like a child and peter shut his chemistry book and took out his headphones before shoving his phone in his back pocket. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess, but when we get home we have to study!&rdquo; He stands up stretching his back out before you quickly jumped up and grabbed your shoes to quickly leave the house. </p><p>When you got the the small coffee house you were quickly met with other students&mdash;mostly college&mdash;people on dates enjoying a cup of coffee on a nice Sunday morning. </p><p>When you ordered peter quickly pulled out cash before you, he threw the ten dollar bill on the counter before you could. You quickly thanked him by placing a kiss on his cheek as his hand gripped tighter into yours as you did so. Peter really wanted to kiss you and show you off to the world but he was afraid of everything and if someone knew he was Spider-Man that&rsquo;s put you in danger. </p><p>With hands intertwined and cups in the other, You and peter walked out and started to make your direction towards Central Park. He held you close to his body feeling more comfortable then he did when you first started dating two months ago.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I swear she was about to burn her hair off it was the funniest thing ever! But luckily MJ still has all her hair.&rdquo; You tell the story of lab last week where MJ nearly burned her hair. Peter heard this story, from you and MJ both but he he enjoyed watching you get excited over a story again.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even want to imagine MJ bald.&rdquo; He laughed and you did too, you looked over at him and saw how he had whipped cream in the corner of his mouth. This was your moment, you and peter would kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; You stop and turn to him. &ldquo;You have something right here.&rdquo; You took the pad of your thumb and wiped off the cream from the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Peter looked down at your thumb as you wiped the cream on your pant leg, you were so close to him, his hand tightened again as he wanted to pull you into him but that&rsquo;d be inappropriate because people were around, aunt may always told him if he doesn&rsquo;t like pda then he shouldn&rsquo;t do it. But he wanted to hold your cheek and kiss your lips that probably tasted like chocolates.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; You look up at him looking for another excuse to touch his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm?&rdquo; He looked into your eyes, he could already feel himself getting nervous. His first real kiss with a girl he really liked! This wasn&rsquo;t 8th grade &lsquo;peck on the lips before I head up to my bunk&rsquo;. This was You, you were so much to peter and all he wanted was you.</p><p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s still some more.&rdquo; You tried to be discreet but peter caught on. He didn&rsquo;t want to wait anymore, he couldn&rsquo;t wait anymore. He pulled you by your hand into his lips. He was absolutely right, you did taste like chocolates and cream, with the hint of cinnamon. Your lips were warm and soft from the drink but he&rsquo;d hope they&rsquo;d always be warm and soft for him. </p><p>It was the same for you, he had soft warm lips that tasted of chocolate, cream was mostly what you tasted because peter loved whipped cream and always asked for extra. He let his hand go as he now relaxed and got more comfortable, he put his hand on your face as your hand went to grip his jacket and pull him in. </p><p>The kiss only lasted about 15 seconds, peter pulled off first but You whimpered for more as you wanted peters lips to be on your all the time.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope that wasn&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo; You apologized but peter shook his head quickly as he gulped still nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;No! You were great,&rdquo; he lets go of your cheek and let&rsquo;s it fall to your waist. &ldquo;I mean, last time I kissed someone was in the 8th grade so I hope you didn&rsquo;t hate what I did.&rdquo; He presses his lips into a fine line.</p><p>&ldquo;My last kiss was never, so I hope that was good.&rdquo; You laugh a little and peter looks at you with wide eyes. How could someone as beautiful as you not get kissed. </p><p>&ldquo;H-How?&rdquo; He stuttered out and you didn&rsquo;t understand what he meant. &ldquo;H-how did no one kiss you?&rdquo; He asked, his eyes were wide as he wanted to kiss you again and again to make up for all the years he could&rsquo;ve had you but didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;Never crossed anyone&rsquo;s mind i guess.&rdquo; You told him, Peter was lost but got this sudden burst of confidence to kiss you again.He placed his lips on yours again and this time pulled you closer by putting his hands on your waist.

You blush and shake your head, you wanted to stay away from the books and stay close to peter for a little longer.</p><p>&ldquo;Or we can stay in the park a little longer?&rdquo; You plead and he smiles and nods with his brown curls flopping somewhat down in his face.

During the gang&rsquo;s Sophomore year of highschool Peter was dating a boy in his AP chemistry class and they have been dating since winter break after Freshman year. This douchebag&rsquo;s name is Carson and he never actually liked Peter. I think you know what happens next.</p><p>Also Harley and a 6 year-old almost murders Flash.</p><h2>Disclaimer:</h2><p>Anyone named Carson out there please don&rsquo;t be offended. I only chose the name Carson because it was the name I got from a random name generator! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this little scenario!</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Peter thought his life was finally going the way he wanted it to! He had Mj and Ned as close friends, was mentored and adopted by Tony Stark, had an actual stark internship, his childhood bestfriend (and unknowning crush since Peter is totally oblivious to his own feelings) Harley Keener moved to New York, and had a pretty popular boyfriend he really liked! Life was great.</p><p>&hellip;or so he thought.</p><p>While waiting in the front of the school with Harley for Happy to pick them up Peter remembered that he left some books in his chemistry class. He told Harley to wait for him and ran inside the building to pickup his books. When he opens the door Peter&rsquo;s whole body froze in shock. Right in front of him was HIS own boyfriend in a heated make out session with Flash fucking Tompson.</p><p>They were so into sucking on eachother&rsquo;s face that they didn&rsquo;t even notice the door slam shut. Peter ran to the boy&rsquo;s bathroom and locked himself in one of the stalls. His eyes were puffy from crying and his breath was shakey as he chocked back a sob. He felt so stupid for falling for a guy like Carson. Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t like him back, he was Penis Parker after all. The school&rsquo;s local loser and orphan.</p><p>After a couple of minutes Peter didn&rsquo;t show up, even after Happy arrived to pick them up. Harley had a bad feeling in his gut so he told happy to wait at the entrance of the school and went to look for Peter. He went to Peter&rsquo;s chemistry class first since he remembered Peter mumbling about leaving a few chemistry books in his class. </p><p>Harley opened to door and saw red. In front of him Carson Scott and Flash Tompson were making out on a lab table with no shame what so ever. Harley Imediatly decked Carson in his stupid face and kicked Flash&rsquo;s stomach hard. Apparently Carson only dated Peter because of Peter&rsquo;s Stark Intership and thought he could get Peter to give him one despite the fact that Peter actually had feelings for the guy. He also found out that he cheated on Peter with Flash on multiple occasions behind Peter&rsquo;s back! </p><p>Harley left them there on the classroom&rsquo;s cold hard floor and Imediatly went looking for Peter. He never liked Carson anyway, he always reminded Harley of his own dad. He ran around the school for a while until he heard chocked down sobs from the boys bathroom. Harley walked in and opened the stall the sounds were coming from. The sight nearly broke his heart. His best friend was sobbing into his knees on the bathroom floor. His eyes were puffy and filled with tears that kept running down his face. His hands were in his now messy brown hair and his voice was strained from all the crying. </p><p>When Peter saw Harley he rushed towards him and pulled him into a tight hug. Harley hugs Peter back with the tightess most comforting hug anyone can ever give.Peter crys into his shoulder while Harley soothingly rubs circles on his back. Harley then makes a silent promise to do everything in his power to make sure Peter happy again, but for right now he has to comfort his bestfriend.</p><p>Lets just say Carson and Flash got a visit from Iron Lad that night, and may or may not have bruises from being hit by dozens of potatoes. </p><p>When Harley and Peter finally started dating after a &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; game of truth or dare Harley was determined to keep his silent promise. He always went above and beyond to make Peter loved and cared for. He always made sure Peter knew he would always be there for him like when they were kids. It made Harley happy that Peter was happy, and thats all that matterd to Harley.</p><p>Peter would always be grateful for Harley. Harley was always there when Peter needed him, unlike Carson who barley acknowledge Peter&rsquo;s problems. Peter was even happier knowing that Harley loved and cared for him in a way Peter loves and cares for Harley. He finally felt happy knowing someone in the world would, and thats all that matterd to Peter.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><h2>Bonus: </h2><h2>BACKROUND INFO:</h2><p>Okay so for those who don&rsquo;t know who Jaxon is he is an original character I made that fits into my Parley/Parkner Childhood Bestfriends AU. No he is not a Marvel OC, but my OCs have multiple versions of themselves like a multiverse. So this version of Jaxon is the little brother to Harley and Peter&rsquo;s dorm neighbor. Who is also Ned&rsquo;s roommate. Harley and Peter would babysit Jaxon often when Jaxon&rsquo;s older brother is too busy to do it himself. I also mentioned him in a previous post. (Harley Keener Headcanons-Childhood Bestfriends AU section) </p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Despite what many others think at first glance Jaxon didn&rsquo;t hate Peter or Harley, in fact the kid adored them. Jaxon looked up to Peter and Harley as if they were his older brothers. Of corse the free food they fe him was a added bonus too. One day Peter and Harley decided to walk around the campus for a bit apparently &ldquo;Kids his age should be going outside more&rdquo;. So they dragged Jaxon off their cozy couch (which wasn&rsquo;t that hard considering Jaxon was 6 and pretty short for his age) and forced him to&hellip;to&hellip;.exercise, which first of all ew and second of all ugh. Jaxon kept scrowling and pouting the whole time. Peter would send him a bright smile while Harley chuckled at the scene. Jaxon would always roll his eyes in a facade of annoyance , but cracked a small smile every once in a while.</p><p>They talked for a bit during their stroll when Peter suddenly stopped and flinched. Peter frowned when his gaze landed on two guys about his age walking together infront of them. Jaxon followed his gaze and saw a boy with short dark hair wispering something into a taller boy&rsquo;s ear. This confused the heck out of Jaxon, why did Peter look so sad? Jaxon than looked up to Harley&rsquo;s face and saw an almost murderous look in the young man&rsquo;s stone cold blue eyes. Next thing Jaxon knew was that Peter was trying to hold Harley back from stomping twords the direction of the two other young men, saying something about how they&rsquo;re not worth a fight and how it was just a waste of time. As they walked back to Harley and Peter&rsquo;s dormroom gears began turning in Jaxon&rsquo;s head as he tried to figure out why Harley and Peter were so upset.</p><p>A few hours after the incident Jaxon decided to ask what happened earlier was about. He thought best it was to avoid the subject with Peter since he still seemed to be a bit hung up about it. Jaxon quitely climed on the couch next to Harley. Harley turned his head and nearly screamed when he saw Jaxon perched on top of the couch arm. At this point Harley was cletching his hand over his heart in shock. Jaxon snorted and merely rolled his eyes at Harley&rsquo;s dramatics. Harley sent an &lsquo;are you serious&rsquo; glare at Jaxon, which he ignored. Jaxon than plops down on the couch to sit properly, you know like a normally boring person. Jaxon asks Harley why him and Peter were so upset when they saw those two boys together earlier. Harley sighed and told him the story of how Carson cheated on Peter with Flash during highschool. </p><p>After telling the story Jaxon could tell Harley was still pissed from the past event, but Jaxon? Jaxon was fucking livid. Why would anyone hurt Peter like that? What did Peter do to deserve being treated like trash to just throw away after being used? Questions started filling his head evan after Harley got up to make a sandwich. Jaxon just didn&rsquo;t understand why anyone would cheat on someone like Peter. Peter was the nicest most selfless person Jaxon has ever met. His blood began to boil. How dare anyone do that to Peter!? Jaxon growled and snarled at the thought of anyone hurting Peter OR Harley like that. He wanted revenge. He wanted to avenge Peter&rsquo;s broken heart even if it was a long time ago, and he came up with just the perfect revenge plan.</p><p>The next day after Jaxon&rsquo;s older brother dropped him off in the morning the three boys were having some breakfast while watching school news. Harley complained about watching the horrible station , but didn&rsquo;t bother turing it off. Jaxon had to guess it was becuase Peter was practically half asleep on his shoulder. Jaxon personally thought this was fucking adorable ,but if anyone asks he will deny this until his dying breath. </p><p>The news lady (Betty Brant) then reported that Flash Tompson and Carson Scott were sent to the hospital last night due to food poisoning. The hospital suspects the poisoning was due to their basket of half-eaten apple he reported they ate earlier that night after been mysteriously dropped off their front door of their dorm. Meanwhile Jaxon smirked in satisfaction at the TV knowing the plan worked.</p><p>At this point Peter was already awake after hearing Flash and Carson&rsquo;s names and hospital in one sentence. Harley raised a brow at Jaxon&rsquo;s direction who responded with a shrug and went back to eating his bowl of frost loops. Harley grinned at him like a mad man (Im pretty sure Jaxon learned to be a little shit from Harley) and ruffled the kid&rsquo;s forest of red hair. Harley then told Peter that he told Jaxon the story and the little brat must have been pissed and wanted revenge. Peter looked midly concerned and shocked that Jaxon poisoned someone, but gave in to the warm feeling in his chest knowing Jaxon did it for him. Peter also made a mental note never to leave Harley and Jaxon anywhere together without proper adult super vision. Which Harley gave an indignant response saying he IS an adult! Which Peter completely ignores (guess we know where Jaxon gets that skill from) jokingly saying about needing a PROPER adult.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><h2>Note:</h2><p>I hope you guys like this!

No he is not a Marvel OC, but my OCs have multiple versions of themselves like a multiverse. So this version of Jaxon is the little brother to Harley and Peter\u2019s dorm neighbor. Who is also Ned\u2019s roommate. Harley and Peter would babysit Jaxon often when Jaxon\u2019s older brother is too busy to do it himself. I also mentioned him in a previous post. (Harley Keener Headcanons-Childhood Bestfriends AU section) </p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Despite what many others think at first glance Jaxon didn\u2019t hate Peter or Harley, in fact the kid adored them. Jaxon looked up to Peter and Harley as if they were his older brothers. Of corse the free food they fe him was a added bonus too. One day Peter and Harley decided to walk around the campus for a bit apparently \u201cKids his age should be going outside more\u201d. So they dragged Jaxon off their cozy couch (which wasn\u2019t that hard considering Jaxon was 6 and pretty short for his age) and forced him to\u2026to\u2026.exercise, which first of all ew and second of all ugh. Jaxon kept scrowling and pouting the whole time. Peter would send him a bright smile while Harley chuckled at the scene. Jaxon would always roll his eyes in a facade of annoyance , but cracked a small smile every once in a while.</p><p>They talked for a bit during their stroll when Peter suddenly stopped and flinched. Peter frowned when his gaze landed on two guys about his age walking together infront of them. Jaxon followed his gaze and saw a boy with short dark hair wispering something into a taller boy\u2019s ear. This confused the heck out of Jaxon, why did Peter look so sad? Jaxon than looked up to Harley\u2019s face and saw an almost murderous look in the young man\u2019s stone cold blue eyes. Next thing Jaxon knew was that Peter was trying to hold Harley back from stomping twords the direction of the two other young men, saying something about how they\u2019re not worth a fight and how it was just a waste of time. As they walked back to Harley and Peter\u2019s dormroom gears began turning in Jaxon\u2019s head as he tried to figure out why Harley and Peter were so upset.</p><p>A few hours after the incident Jaxon decided to ask what happened earlier was about. He thought best it was to avoid the subject with Peter since he still seemed to be a bit hung up about it. Jaxon quitely climed on the couch next to Harley. Harley turned his head and nearly screamed when he saw Jaxon perched on top of the couch arm. At this point Harley was cletching his hand over his heart in shock. Jaxon snorted and merely rolled his eyes at Harley\u2019s dramatics. Harley sent an \u2018are you serious\u2019 glare at Jaxon, which he ignored. Jaxon than plops down on the couch to sit properly, you know like a normally boring person. Jaxon asks Harley why him and Peter were so upset when they saw those two boys together earlier. Harley sighed and told him the story of how Carson cheated on Peter with Flash during highschool. </p><p>After telling the story Jaxon could tell Harley was still pissed from the past event, but Jaxon? Jaxon was fucking livid. Why would anyone hurt Peter like that? What did Peter do to deserve being treated like trash to just throw away after being used? Questions started filling his head evan after Harley got up to make a sandwich. Jaxon just didn\u2019t understand why anyone would cheat on someone like Peter. Peter was the nicest most selfless person Jaxon has ever met. His blood began to boil. How dare anyone do that to Peter!? Jaxon growled and snarled at the thought of anyone hurting Peter OR Harley like that. He wanted revenge. He wanted to avenge Peter\u2019s broken heart even if it was a long time ago, and he came up with just the perfect revenge plan.</p><p>The next day after Jaxon\u2019s older brother dropped him off in the morning the three boys were having some breakfast while watching school news. Harley complained about watching the horrible station , but didn\u2019t bother turing it off. Jaxon had to guess it was becuase Peter was practically half asleep on his shoulder. Jaxon personally thought this was fucking adorable ,but if anyone asks he will deny this until his dying breath. </p><p>The news lady (Betty Brant) then reported that Flash Tompson and Carson Scott were sent to the hospital last night due to food poisoning. The hospital suspects the poisoning was due to their basket of half-eaten apple he reported they ate earlier that night after been mysteriously dropped off their front door of their dorm. Meanwhile Jaxon smirked in satisfaction at the TV knowing the plan worked.</p><p>At this point Peter was already awake after hearing Flash and Carson\u2019s names and hospital in one sentence. Harley raised a brow at Jaxon\u2019s direction who responded with a shrug and went back to eating his bowl of frost loops. Harley grinned at him like a mad man (Im pretty sure Jaxon learned to be a little shit from Harley) and ruffled the kid\u2019s forest of red hair. Harley then told Peter that he told Jaxon the story and the little brat must have been pissed and wanted revenge. Peter looked midly concerned and shocked that Jaxon poisoned someone, but gave in to the warm feeling in his chest knowing Jaxon did it for him. Peter also made a mental note never to leave Harley and Jaxon anywhere together without proper adult super vision. Which Harley gave an indignant response saying he IS an adult! Which Peter completely ignores (guess we know where Jaxon gets that skill from) jokingly saying about needing a PROPER adult.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><h2>Note:</h2><p>I hope you guys like this!

                "content": "<p><h1>Harley Keener is a good (Boy)friend and Babysitter</h1><h2>BACKROUND INFO:</h2><p>Takes place in my Parkner/Parley Childhood Bestfriends AU. During the gang&rsquo;s Sophomore year of highschool Peter was dating a boy in his AP chemistry class and they have been dating since winter break after Freshman year. This douchebag&rsquo;s name is Carson and he never actually liked Peter. I think you know what happens next.</p><p>Also Harley and a 6 year-old almost murders Flash.</p><h2>Disclaimer:</h2><p>Anyone named Carson out there please don&rsquo;t be offended. I only chose the name Carson because it was the name I got from a random name generator! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this little scenario!</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Peter thought his life was finally going the way he wanted it to! He had Mj and Ned as close friends, was mentored and adopted by Tony Stark, had an actual stark internship, his childhood bestfriend (and unknowning crush since Peter is totally oblivious to his own feelings) Harley Keener moved to New York, and had a pretty popular boyfriend he really liked! Life was great.</p><p>&hellip;or so he thought.</p><p>While waiting in the front of the school with Harley for Happy to pick them up Peter remembered that he left some books in his chemistry class. He told Harley to wait for him and ran inside the building to pickup his books. When he opens the door Peter&rsquo;s whole body froze in shock. Right in front of him was HIS own boyfriend in a heated make out session with Flash fucking Tompson.</p><p>They were so into sucking on eachother&rsquo;s face that they didn&rsquo;t even notice the door slam shut. Peter ran to the boy&rsquo;s bathroom and locked himself in one of the stalls. His eyes were puffy from crying and his breath was shakey as he chocked back a sob. He felt so stupid for falling for a guy like Carson. Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t like him back, he was Penis Parker after all. The school&rsquo;s local loser and orphan.</p><p>After a couple of minutes Peter didn&rsquo;t show up, even after Happy arrived to pick them up. Harley had a bad feeling in his gut so he told happy to wait at the entrance of the school and went to look for Peter. He went to Peter&rsquo;s chemistry class first since he remembered Peter mumbling about leaving a few chemistry books in his class. </p><p>Harley opened to door and saw red. In front of him Carson Scott and Flash Tompson were making out on a lab table with no shame what so ever. Harley Imediatly decked Carson in his stupid face and kicked Flash&rsquo;s stomach hard. Apparently Carson only dated Peter because of Peter&rsquo;s Stark Intership and thought he could get Peter to give him one despite the fact that Peter actually had feelings for the guy. He also found out that he cheated on Peter with Flash on multiple occasions behind Peter&rsquo;s back! </p><p>Harley left them there on the classroom&rsquo;s cold hard floor and Imediatly went looking for Peter. He never liked Carson anyway, he always reminded Harley of his own dad. He ran around the school for a while until he heard chocked down sobs from the boys bathroom. Harley walked in and opened the stall the sounds were coming from. The sight nearly broke his heart. His best friend was sobbing into his knees on the bathroom floor. His eyes were puffy and filled with tears that kept running down his face. His hands were in his now messy brown hair and his voice was strained from all the crying. </p><p>When Peter saw Harley he rushed towards him and pulled him into a tight hug. Harley hugs Peter back with the tightess most comforting hug anyone can ever give.Peter crys into his shoulder while Harley soothingly rubs circles on his back.
