I&rsquo;m so very glad that Mary had friends to talk to and a mother-in-law who experienced the same to empathize with. Poor Sansa hasn&rsquo;t had anyone to discuss it with, she has siblings that off handedly mention it without a care (Bran and Arya) and her one ally in getting herself justice is gone at the moment (Jon). Brienne is her sworn shield and there seems to be a distance there and they don&rsquo;t seem to confide in one another. The last season of Game of Thrones was very rushed so perhaps they happened behind the scenes but i truly wish that if traumatizing things happen in shows that they take the time to discuss the aftermath as they have done with Mary in Reign</p>",

I hope not. </b></p><p>I don\u2019t want it to be two women fighting for the hero of the\nstory, who is Jon Snow (it is known). If it\u2019s like that than Dany can have him.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Back to Dany and Sansa:</p><p>I want Sansa to fight her feelings. I don\u2019t want her to let\nthem win. Because this would be consistent with the Sansa I have seen. She has\nnot acknowledged her feelings to the extent that perhaps Jon has already. Sansa\nis done with romantic love. And even if Jon\u2019s truth comes to light, I don\u2019t see\nSansa coming up with the \u00a0\u201chey let\u2019s just\nmarry\u201d solution. Especially in light of Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship. <br/></p><p>It sucks, but\nI think Sansa may be Jonsa (political) marriage\u2019s biggest opposition at first. I think that\nwhen she finds out about Jon (his parentage, his relationship with Dany, and\nhis love for Sansa), <b>Sansa will be hurt overall</b>. She will\ncontinue to support his claim. She will fight the Northern Lords for Jon\u2019s claim.\nThis is because she does not want to be the Key to the North again. \u00a0But she won\u2019t accept Jon in a romantic way.\nNot right away. Especially when faced with Jon\u2019s antics and the possibility that Dany may be pregnant. <br/></p><p>I picture Sansa fighting the marriage passionately, Dany\nbeing enraged by it, and Jon in his mind going \u201cYes!!!\u201d Every time I envision\nhis openly going for Sansa in this context, I\u2019m reminded of all the men who\nhave hurt her, used her, and used her \u201ckey\u201d status. And I think she will be\ntoo. So Jon may go for it, but he may not too. And I\u2019m not sure which is better\nfor him long term. <br/></p><p>I picture Jon saying nothing aloud for atleast half the\nseason about the way he feels. He loves Sansa. I am convinced that he will be\nconvinced that saying anything to Sansa about how he feels would just hurt her.\nSo <b>he needs to let his actions speak for him.</b> Like how he left her the North.\nThat scene was so beautiful and wonderful. </p><p>I picture Dany fighting for Jon with everything she\u2019s got.\nUsing the possibility or reality of a pregnancy. Their shared heritage. Their\nlove. His bending the knee. Her dragons. The fact that while Sansa is his\nblood, so is she. She is an emotionally driven woman, so I do think this is entirely possible.\u00a0 </p><p>I envision Dany arriving at Winterfell and immediately sizing\nSansa up. I am convinced Dany will propose a Tyrion and Sansa re-marriage. That she will try and force Sansa to acquiesce.\n Sansa will stay strong. Even if it\u2019s not\nDany who proposes this, I think she\u2019ll like it and support it in that Queenly way of hers, and Sansa will make her\nallegiance clear. </p><p>Dany will want Sansa out of the way maybe within moments of meeting her. Even if Jon and Sansa are siblings only, meddlesome sisters of dudes who you are in a relationship with are annoying. In her eyes if Jon is her man, and he has bent the knee as the King\nin the North, then his sister can\u2019t be the Lady of Winterfell. Winterfell is\nthe \u201cseat\u201d of the North. Possibly. I don\u2019t picture Dany being magnanimous about this. Because\nshe never is. And she has never had to \u201cshare\u201d her men before. Drogo was all hers. She enjoyed this. Daario was all hers. Jorah is all hers. Tyrion is all hers too (even fighting against his family). Every man in her life is all hers. The only significant man her life that isn\u2019t hers is Greyworm. And that is because he belongs to Missendai and Dany thought him incapable of sex for a good long while. But I\u2019m being uncharitable here now, so I\u2019ll stop. <br/></p><p>When Sansa says no to Tyrion, she may herself propose\nanother alliance.

I hope not. </b></p><p>I don\u2019t want it to be two women fighting for the hero of the\nstory, who is Jon Snow (it is known). If it\u2019s like that than Dany can have him.\u00a0 <br></p><p>Back to Dany and Sansa:</p><p>I want Sansa to fight her feelings. I don\u2019t want her to let\nthem win. Because this would be consistent with the Sansa I have seen. She has\nnot acknowledged her feelings to the extent that perhaps Jon has already. Sansa\nis done with romantic love. And even if Jon\u2019s truth comes to light, I don\u2019t see\nSansa coming up with the \u00a0\u201chey let\u2019s just\nmarry\u201d solution. Especially in light of Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship. <br></p><p>It sucks, but\nI think Sansa may be Jonsa (political) marriage\u2019s biggest opposition at first. I think that\nwhen she finds out about Jon (his parentage, his relationship with Dany, and\nhis love for Sansa), <b>Sansa will be hurt overall</b>. She will\ncontinue to support his claim. She will fight the Northern Lords for Jon\u2019s claim.\nThis is because she does not want to be the Key to the North again. \u00a0But she won\u2019t accept Jon in a romantic way.\nNot right away. Especially when faced with Jon\u2019s antics and the possibility that Dany may be pregnant. <br></p><p>I picture Sansa fighting the marriage passionately, Dany\nbeing enraged by it, and Jon in his mind going \u201cYes!!!\u201d Every time I envision\nhis openly going for Sansa in this context, I\u2019m reminded of all the men who\nhave hurt her, used her, and used her \u201ckey\u201d status. And I think she will be\ntoo. So Jon may go for it, but he may not too. And I\u2019m not sure which is better\nfor him long term. <br></p><p>I picture Jon saying nothing aloud for atleast half the\nseason about the way he feels. He loves Sansa. I am convinced that he will be\nconvinced that saying anything to Sansa about how he feels would just hurt her.\nSo <b>he needs to let his actions speak for him.</b> Like how he left her the North.\nThat scene was so beautiful and wonderful. </p><p>I picture Dany fighting for Jon with everything she\u2019s got.\nUsing the possibility or reality of a pregnancy. Their shared heritage. Their\nlove. His bending the knee. Her dragons. The fact that while Sansa is his\nblood, so is she. She is an emotionally driven woman, so I do think this is entirely possible.\u00a0 </p><p>I envision Dany arriving at Winterfell and immediately sizing\nSansa up. I am convinced Dany will propose a Tyrion and Sansa re-marriage. That she will try and force Sansa to acquiesce.\n Sansa will stay strong. Even if it\u2019s not\nDany who proposes this, I think she\u2019ll like it and support it in that Queenly way of hers, and Sansa will make her\nallegiance clear. </p><p>Dany will want Sansa out of the way maybe within moments of meeting her. Even if Jon and Sansa are siblings only, meddlesome sisters of dudes who you are in a relationship with are annoying. In her eyes if Jon is her man, and he has bent the knee as the King\nin the North, then his sister can\u2019t be the Lady of Winterfell. Winterfell is\nthe \u201cseat\u201d of the North. Possibly. I don\u2019t picture Dany being magnanimous about this. Because\nshe never is. And she has never had to \u201cshare\u201d her men before. Drogo was all hers. She enjoyed this. Daario was all hers. Jorah is all hers. Tyrion is all hers too (even fighting against his family). Every man in her life is all hers. The only significant man her life that isn\u2019t hers is Greyworm. And that is because he belongs to Missendai and Dany thought him incapable of sex for a good long while.
