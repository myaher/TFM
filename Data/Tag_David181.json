Thank you so much for reading &lt;3</b></p><hr><p><b><br/></b>\u201cAlright, John, I\u2019m off to the shops,\u201d Rose said, putting on her leather jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple hours.\u201d<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d He fidgeted. It had only been a bit more than a week since he arrived, and he was still getting used to Pete\u2019s world.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve nearly eaten me out of house and home,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent every waking moment together. It\u2019d be nice to have some time alone, right? Absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that.\u201d</p><p>In all honesty, Rose was going through a period of adjustment as well. As much as John had the Doctor\u2019s memories and cleverness, he was also the exact physical facsimile of the alien she had loved so deeply she risked the souls of everyone in her universe to touch him again \u2026 but he <i>wasn\u2019t</i> the Doctor. Neither of them. His hearts did not beat a double tattoo in her ear when she dared to put her ear to his chest. He had not traveled to the ends of the universe, lived and loved and lost. After the loss of Nine and Ten, it was difficult to bear.</p><p>John was \u2026 John. And although his physical appearance was the loveliest thing she has ever seen, he was not the man she loved. But she felt she <i>could</i> love him, eventually. In the eight days they had cohabited, there had been golden moments when she saw a flash of the luminary she had once clung to, and she knew there would be more moments. But she wanted the feeling to grow naturally.</p><p>So they still slept very much apart.</p><p>\u201cThe heart,\u201d he said, putting his hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, putting her hand over his. She caressed his prickly face. \u201cAnd remember, you have to shave every day if you want your face to be smooth. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up looking like a mountain man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like that?\u201d he said with a sweet fragility that made her eyes water.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Maybe? He never let-\u201d she stopped talking abruptly. She promised herself she wouldn\u2019t mention the Doctor. It wasn\u2019t fair to John. But in the end, she still couldn\u2019t help it. She missed his honey scent and the galaxies swirling in in his rich brown eyes.</p><p>There were no galaxies in John\u2019s eyes - just twin stars. Lovely, but far less bright.</p><p>She popped in her earpod and walked to the door. \u201cIf you need anything, gimme a bell, okay?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the earpod on the coffee table in front of the holocube. He was still getting very used to the technology.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off, then. You can try to go online if you like. Your bio info is in the cube now,\u201d she said, referring to the advanced computer system. With Mickey\u2019s help, they had been able to hack a new identity for him and enter him into New Britain\u2019s mainframe as a new citizen. To the powers that be, he was an emigre from the South American State.</p><p>He sat down on the sofa and fiddled with the cube. As she was walking out, he popped up suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Rose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you bring a couple boxes of those crumbly berry biscuits? I like those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean jammy dodgers?\u201d her mouth trembled with mirth.</p><p>\u201cThose.\u201d His eyes brightened.</p><p>God, did he love to eat, but his metabolism was so stellar she doubted he would gain a single kilo. \u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd potatoes for mash. And peas. And custard and cake and jam - for trifle. And roast beef, ooh I love that. And crispy sausages and bread and butter for eggy in a basket-\u201d</p><p>She put her hand up. \u201cOkay, okay, I get it. You keep it up and I\u2019ll have to call a zeppelin to get all that stuff back here.\u201d</p><p>He bounced and bit his lower lip. \u201cBut you\u2019ll get the biscuits, at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said with a sigh, and finally walked out the door.</p><hr><p>He was filled with energy. All that talk of food had made him hungry. He opened the fridge and frowned. She was right. It was empty save for some milk and bottles of sauce and milk. He ran his hand over the top of the cupboard, where he knew Rose hid whatever she didn\u2019t want him to devour right away. He felt something promising.</p><p>\u201cJaffa Cakes!\u201d he said, ripping into the box. He grabbed the glass bottle of milk and sat down on the sofa. The holocube flashed.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, John Smith,\u201d a soothing female voice said. Scrolling text and various news stations materialized around him, bombarding him with holographic images. There was a flood in India. And, as usual, America was in the midst of political upheaval.</p><p>The holocube sensed his disinterest. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to see?\u201d</p><p>He chewed his cake and took a sip of milk. The holocube started to play food ads.</p><p>\u201cAdd a little sunshine to their tea,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said, and a holo of a little boy ran by him and to an image of a kitchen table with a big plate of Jaffa cakes. He bit into it enthusiastically and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d he said to the image, and popped the rest of the cake in his mouth.</p><p>Again, the holocube sensed his disinterest. His alpha waves were barely blipping. \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to see?\u201d</p><p>He sucked melted chocolate from his fingers and sighed. \u201cRose, honestly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRose,\u201d it repeated, and multiple windows started popping up around him.</p><p>Flowers. Rows of things - things and people. A flash of frenetic movement caught his eye under the the Rosa centifolia window with all the horticultural information on it.</p><p>He touched the corner of the floating image, and just like in a computer, it came forward. It was an image of a woman touching herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d His eyes grew huge. His lips parted, and heat crawled up his neck and made his cheeks tingle.</p><!-- more --><p>This woman. He had never seen anything like it. He felt his chemicals working, and his muscles tightened frightfully. His mouth watered, but he still put down the fresh biscult. He wasn\u2019t hungry anymore.</p><p>The cube noticed the spike in activity in his pleasure center, and more windows started popping up around him, all of them with ladies in various states of undress.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. I-\u201d His lower lip wobbled.</p><p>It was extraordinary. She was so firm. So \u2026 delicious. Saliva flooded his mouth, and blood rushed to his groin.</p><p>He had seen Rose fully clothed - she rarely showed him more than her bare arms, and still he felt a bit breathless when she moved a certain way around him. But this. He was dizzy, and his vision suddenly went telescopic.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He used the new swear word Rose taught him and jumped up. He ached beneath his belly button. He looked down and yelled. His jeans were tented. He touched himself, and the sensation made him groan.</p><p>Sweat dripped down his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is happening?\u201d he asked, using another swear word he didn\u2019t dare use around Rose, but had learned from the holocube programs she loved to watch.</p><p>Another window popped up. Article after article about the male sex response began to glow around him, along with more images of women doing things.</p><p>He touched the closest one, and a very serious article came up.</p><p>\u201c<b>The sexual response cycle refers to the sequence of physical and emotional changes that occur as a person becomes sexually aroused and participates in sexually stimulating activities, including intercourse and masturbation</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntercourse and masturbation?\u201d he said out loud. Another couple of windows popped up, but he kept reading.</p><p>\u201c<b>The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Both men and women experience these phases, although the timing usually is different. For example, it is unlikely that both partners will reach orgasm at the same time</b>.\u201d</p><p><i>Orgasm</i>. The word sounded alien, but promising.</p><p>\u201c<b>Physical and/or psychological stimulation leads to vasodilation and subsequent increased blood flow into the penis. The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the scrotum is pulled tighter, and the testes are pulled up against the body.</b>\u201d</p><p><i>Enlarged and firm.</i> He looked between his legs. <i>Check</i>.</p><p>\u201c<b>With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises, and breathing becomes more rapid.</b>\u201d<br/><br/>He was panting a bit. And his heartbeat had risen by at least 20 beats per minute.</p><p><i>So it\u2019s normal.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat is sexual stimulation?\u201d He said to the cube.</p><p>\u201c<b>Sexual stimulation is any stimulus (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains sexual arousal, and may lead to orgasm. Stimulation can be by self (e.g., masturbation) or by a sexual partner (sexual intercourse or other sexual activity).</b>\u201d</p><p>There was that word again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is orgasm?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Orgasm is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or with a sex partner.</b></p><p>\u201cMasturbation,\u201d he read out loud.</p><p>Yet again, images began to flood the holo.</p><p>He made a soft gurgling noise.</p><p>Women do that? Touch themselves like that?</p><p>He swallowed hard. The pain had gone away for a bit while he did his research, but it was back now, and even more intense. He riffled through the images, each one more titillating than the last. He began to feel a strange euphoria. His scientist\u2019s brain repeated back what he just read.</p><p><i>They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations.</i></p><p>His cock pressed insistently on his fly, and it was throbbing. The feeling was both amazing and miserable. His thoughts drifted to Rose.</p><p><i>What do I do with it?</i> He thought. He couldn\u2019t very well shrug and say \u201cI dunno how\u201d if she ever wanted to do something like the women were doing all around him.</p><p>He wanted to learn everything, really research the female sexual response for science, but he couldn\u2019t quite get his thoughts together as easily as usual. It was like there was loud static coming from his groin, drowning out reason. He thought of orgasm - the ultimate discharge of sexual excitement.</p><p>Perhaps, if he could do that, then he could concentrate enough to start his important research. </p><p>He needed to masturbate.</p><p>\u201cMale masturbation,\u201d he said. And now there were cocks everywhere, men with their fists pumping, hairy, groaning, and wet.</p><p>\u201cArrgh!\u201d he said, jumping up and away. \u201cNo more!\u201d</p><p>All the images disappeared. His heart pounded, and the ache had not diminished. He rolled his eyes. Of course all it took was his hand. He could control pressure, speed, and rhythm that way. It made perfect sense.</p><p>He looked around, then ran to the bathroom. The quicker he could finish, the quicker he could get to learning.</p><p>He unbuttoned his jeans and pulled them and his underwear down. Rose\u2019s bathroom had a huge mirror on the door, and he turned to look at himself. He suppressed a giggle. He looked silly - long and slim, like a white oak coat rack with only one hook. He bounced. His cock bounced with him, slapping his belly.</p><p><i>Ooh. That feels mmm.</i></p><p>He did it again. Again it slapped his belly, sending a hot bolt of pleasure up his spine.</p><p><i>Hmmm.</i></p><p>He turned his back on the mirror and licked his palm. All the men had been slick.</p><p>\u201cI just grab it like this-\u201d He wrapped his fist at the base of his cock and pumped quickly as the men had done on the holo - and nearly passed out. He collapsed on the toilet, groaning.</p><p>\u201cShit. Bollocks.<i> Bloody fucking hell</i>,\u201d he said softly, using up his whole swear arsenal. His thigh muscles twitched.</p><p>It was way too much stimulation too soon. His nipples were sensitive to the cloth rubbing against them. Even licking his lips felt different. His response was optimal, but he mustn\u2019t rush it.</p><p><i>Go slow.</i></p><p>He licked his palm again, then wrapped his hand around himself - not too tight, not too loose - and moved it slowly. His foreskin swallowed the swollen head of his cock and the sensation was\u2026</p><p><i>Stellar. The proper word is stellar,</i> he thought.</p><p>He pulled it back and up again, slowly. His toes curled on the tile.</p><p><i>Oh, this is nice.</i></p><p>His balls tightened and the skin warmed, just like the articles stated. Without really thinking, he cupped them with his other hand, caressing them with his thumb.</p><p>He sighed and arched. No article needed to tell him to do that. And it was bloody brilliant.</p><p>He played around with rhythm, barely moving his fist, then pumping up his shaft in overlapping strokes until his fist covered the crown of his cock.</p><p>He moaned loudly, leaning back and spreading his legs.</p><p>His palm was deplorably dry again. Although he didn\u2019t explicitly need more lubrication to finish, he liked the feel of it. He looked around the bathroom.</p><p>Spring rain-scented bath gel? The soap would irritate. Conditioner? That would get messy. Rose\u2019s bath oil? Way too strongly scented, it would be a dead giveaway, since he only took showers. His eyes drifted to the bottle of lotion by the sink.</p><p><b>Ultra-moisturizing</b>, it exclaimed right on the label. <b>Unscented</b>.</p><p>Perfect. He squirted it into his palm and slathered it on himself. He felt silly again, but only until he slowly slid his cock into his lotion-slick hand. He steadied his fist against the counter and began to pump his hips.</p><p>His head spun.</p><p>This sensation was not in the vast catalog of knowledge the Doctor had given to him. It was a swelling madness. Potential energy in its most beautiful manifestation. He was a river right before it spilled over the lip of a waterfall.</p><p>He pumped faster, and his breath quickened with his thrusts.</p><p>With a woman, with <i>her</i>, how would it be? Would she love it like he did, feel the same dumb beauty in it? His thoughts unraveled into pure sensation.</p><p>The women. Their faces. The sounds they made, when they touched themselves. Their breasts, mysterious orbs, each topped with swollen buds his lips parted to suck. Them, and the silky, hot cleft which he knew was a million times better than his lubed fist.</p><p>All of them had it. Every pretty girl he met as Rose showed him around London.</p><p>So soft.</p><p>And she had it too. She hid it, like they all did, but she had it. And he knew of her unfulfilled desires toward the Doctor. He also knew why the Doctor, regardless of his desire, had abstained.</p><p>But <i>he</i> didn\u2019t have to. He was human, and whole, and eager.</p><p>He looked down at himself. His belly muscles were tight with his impending release. His brow was wet with sweat, and his moans were loud and exultant.</p><p>He would share this with Rose, if she would have him. She could teach him all she knew, and he would learn her.</p><p><i>Every</i>- he felt the spike in heart rate.</p><p><i>Delicious</i>- a deep euphoria, much more intense and full, rose from between his legs, pinged past his heart and shot straight to his brain.</p><p><i>Inch</i>- he grunted as his cock pulsed and spurted onto the vanity mirror. His eyes rolled back and he felt the pleasure sluice through him, over and over, a pleasantly fading echo.</p><p>He let his heart slow, then took a deep, shuddering breath and stretched. His reflection in the mirror was flushed and sated. He smiled at himself. Even his blinking has slowed. He cleaned the evidence and pulled on his pants.</p><p>Although he thought he could go right back to researching, he was filled with a calm bliss that tempted him to taking a nap. He lay on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple minutes. Then, studying,\u201d he said to himself. He closed his eyes, and slept.</p><hr><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Rose yelled at him. He could hear rustling from the front door.</p><p>He popped up. It was winter, and night had fallen. How long had he been asleep?? He ran to the door to help her with the grocery bags.</p><p>The stars shone over the now pollutionless sky over New London. It was full night. A couple of minutes had turned to several hours of deep, dreamless sleep. He smiled. He had trouble resting, but now the remedy was clear.</p><p>They chatted as they put away the groceries, then Rose ran her fingers through his sleep-tousled hair and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou finally get some good sleep?\u201d She knew about his tossing and turning.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just drifted right off,\u201d he said. There was a certain look in her eyes that he had been oblivious to before, but not anymore. Was it hunger? Curiosity?</p><p>Maybe. But he would foster it. Encourage it, until it spilled over like he had.</p><p>She flushed, then turned to take something out the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye fancy tonight?\u201d she said, bending down to get to the vegetable drawers at the bottom. Her pants stretched enticingly over her bum. The blood rushed to his groin again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m actually not that hungry,\u201d he said breathlessly.</p><p>She turned to look at him, still bent over. Her back arched. \u201cYou sure?\u201d she said. Her eyes searched his face, sensing something different.</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d he replied, leaning back against the counter to take her in.</p><p>She took a little longer than she needed to put away the carrots and celery.</p>",

A flash of frenetic movement caught his eye under the the Rosa centifolia window with all the horticultural information on it.</p><p>He touched the corner of the floating image, and just like in a computer, it came forward. It was an image of a woman touching herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d His eyes grew huge. His lips parted, and heat crawled up his neck and made his cheeks tingle.</p>[[MORE]]<p>This woman. He had never seen anything like it. He felt his chemicals working, and his muscles tightened frightfully. His mouth watered, but he still put down the fresh biscult. He wasn\u2019t hungry anymore.</p><p>The cube noticed the spike in activity in his pleasure center, and more windows started popping up around him, all of them with ladies in various states of undress.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. I-\u201d His lower lip wobbled.</p><p>It was extraordinary. She was so firm. So \u2026 delicious. Saliva flooded his mouth, and blood rushed to his groin.</p><p>He had seen Rose fully clothed - she rarely showed him more than her bare arms, and still he felt a bit breathless when she moved a certain way around him. But this. He was dizzy, and his vision suddenly went telescopic.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He used the new swear word Rose taught him and jumped up. He ached beneath his belly button. He looked down and yelled. His jeans were tented. He touched himself, and the sensation made him groan.</p><p>Sweat dripped down his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is happening?\u201d he asked, using another swear word he didn\u2019t dare use around Rose, but had learned from the holocube programs she loved to watch.</p><p>Another window popped up. Article after article about the male sex response began to glow around him, along with more images of women doing things.</p><p>He touched the closest one, and a very serious article came up.</p><p>\u201c<b>The sexual response cycle refers to the sequence of physical and emotional changes that occur as a person becomes sexually aroused and participates in sexually stimulating activities, including intercourse and masturbation</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntercourse and masturbation?\u201d he said out loud. Another couple of windows popped up, but he kept reading.</p><p>\u201c<b>The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Both men and women experience these phases, although the timing usually is different. For example, it is unlikely that both partners will reach orgasm at the same time</b>.\u201d</p><p><i>Orgasm</i>. The word sounded alien, but promising.</p><p>\u201c<b>Physical and/or psychological stimulation leads to vasodilation and subsequent increased blood flow into the penis. The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the scrotum is pulled tighter, and the testes are pulled up against the body.</b>\u201d</p><p><i>Enlarged and firm.</i> He looked between his legs. <i>Check</i>.</p><p>\u201c<b>With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises, and breathing becomes more rapid.</b>\u201d<br><br>He was panting a bit. And his heartbeat had risen by at least 20 beats per minute.</p><p><i>So it\u2019s normal.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat is sexual stimulation?\u201d He said to the cube.</p><p>\u201c<b>Sexual stimulation is any stimulus (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains sexual arousal, and may lead to orgasm. Stimulation can be by self (e.g., masturbation) or by a sexual partner (sexual intercourse or other sexual activity).</b>\u201d</p><p>There was that word again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is orgasm?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Orgasm is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or with a sex partner.</b></p><p>\u201cMasturbation,\u201d he read out loud.</p><p>Yet again, images began to flood the holo.</p><p>He made a soft gurgling noise.</p><p>Women do that? Touch themselves like that?</p><p>He swallowed hard. The pain had gone away for a bit while he did his research, but it was back now, and even more intense. He riffled through the images, each one more titillating than the last. He began to feel a strange euphoria. His scientist\u2019s brain repeated back what he just read.</p><p><i>They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations.</i></p><p>His cock pressed insistently on his fly, and it was throbbing. The feeling was both amazing and miserable. His thoughts drifted to Rose.</p><p><i>What do I do with it?</i> He thought. He couldn\u2019t very well shrug and say \u201cI dunno how\u201d if she ever wanted to do something like the women were doing all around him.</p><p>He wanted to learn everything, really research the female sexual response for science, but he couldn\u2019t quite get his thoughts together as easily as usual. It was like there was loud static coming from his groin, drowning out reason. He thought of orgasm - the ultimate discharge of sexual excitement.</p><p>Perhaps, if he could do that, then he could concentrate enough to start his important research. </p><p>He needed to masturbate.</p><p>\u201cMale masturbation,\u201d he said. And now there were cocks everywhere, men with their fists pumping, hairy, groaning, and wet.</p><p>\u201cArrgh!\u201d he said, jumping up and away. \u201cNo more!\u201d</p><p>All the images disappeared. His heart pounded, and the ache had not diminished. He rolled his eyes. Of course all it took was his hand. He could control pressure, speed, and rhythm that way. It made perfect sense.</p><p>He looked around, then ran to the bathroom. The quicker he could finish, the quicker he could get to learning.</p><p>He unbuttoned his jeans and pulled them and his underwear down. Rose\u2019s bathroom had a huge mirror on the door, and he turned to look at himself. He suppressed a giggle. He looked silly - long and slim, like a white oak coat rack with only one hook. He bounced. His cock bounced with him, slapping his belly.</p><p><i>Ooh. That feels mmm.</i></p><p>He did it again. Again it slapped his belly, sending a hot bolt of pleasure up his spine.</p><p><i>Hmmm.</i></p><p>He turned his back on the mirror and licked his palm. All the men had been slick.</p><p>\u201cI just grab it like this-\u201d He wrapped his fist at the base of his cock and pumped quickly as the men had done on the holo - and nearly passed out. He collapsed on the toilet, groaning.</p><p>\u201cShit. Bollocks.<i> Bloody fucking hell</i>,\u201d he said softly, using up his whole swear arsenal. His thigh muscles twitched.</p><p>It was way too much stimulation too soon. His nipples were sensitive to the cloth rubbing against them. Even licking his lips felt different. His response was optimal, but he mustn\u2019t rush it.</p><p><i>Go slow.</i></p><p>He licked his palm again, then wrapped his hand around himself - not too tight, not too loose - and moved it slowly. His foreskin swallowed the swollen head of his cock and the sensation was\u2026</p><p><i>Stellar. The proper word is stellar,</i> he thought.</p><p>He pulled it back and up again, slowly. His toes curled on the tile.</p><p><i>Oh, this is nice.</i></p><p>His balls tightened and the skin warmed, just like the articles stated. Without really thinking, he cupped them with his other hand, caressing them with his thumb.</p><p>He sighed and arched. No article needed to tell him to do that. And it was bloody brilliant.</p><p>He played around with rhythm, barely moving his fist, then pumping up his shaft in overlapping strokes until his fist covered the crown of his cock.</p><p>He moaned loudly, leaning back and spreading his legs.</p><p>His palm was deplorably dry again. Although he didn\u2019t explicitly need more lubrication to finish, he liked the feel of it. He looked around the bathroom.</p><p>Spring rain-scented bath gel? The soap would irritate. Conditioner? That would get messy. Rose\u2019s bath oil? Way too strongly scented, it would be a dead giveaway, since he only took showers. His eyes drifted to the bottle of lotion by the sink.</p><p><b>Ultra-moisturizing</b>, it exclaimed right on the label. <b>Unscented</b>.</p><p>Perfect. He squirted it into his palm and slathered it on himself. He felt silly again, but only until he slowly slid his cock into his lotion-slick hand. He steadied his fist against the counter and began to pump his hips.</p><p>His head spun.</p><p>This sensation was not in the vast catalog of knowledge the Doctor had given to him. It was a swelling madness. Potential energy in its most beautiful manifestation. He was a river right before it spilled over the lip of a waterfall.</p><p>He pumped faster, and his breath quickened with his thrusts.</p><p>With a woman, with <i>her</i>, how would it be? Would she love it like he did, feel the same dumb beauty in it? His thoughts unraveled into pure sensation.</p><p>The women. Their faces. The sounds they made, when they touched themselves. Their breasts, mysterious orbs, each topped with swollen buds his lips parted to suck. Them, and the silky, hot cleft which he knew was a million times better than his lubed fist.</p><p>All of them had it. Every pretty girl he met as Rose showed him around London.</p><p>So soft.</p><p>And she had it too. She hid it, like they all did, but she had it. And he knew of her unfulfilled desires toward the Doctor. He also knew why the Doctor, regardless of his desire, had abstained.</p><p>But <i>he</i> didn\u2019t have to. He was human, and whole, and eager.</p><p>He looked down at himself. His belly muscles were tight with his impending release. His brow was wet with sweat, and his moans were loud and exultant.</p><p>He would share this with Rose, if she would have him. She could teach him all she knew, and he would learn her.</p><p><i>Every</i>- he felt the spike in heart rate.</p><p><i>Delicious</i>- a deep euphoria, much more intense and full, rose from between his legs, pinged past his heart and shot straight to his brain.</p><p><i>Inch</i>- he grunted as his cock pulsed and spurted onto the vanity mirror. His eyes rolled back and he felt the pleasure sluice through him, over and over, a pleasantly fading echo.</p><p>He let his heart slow, then took a deep, shuddering breath and stretched. His reflection in the mirror was flushed and sated. He smiled at himself. Even his blinking has slowed. He cleaned the evidence and pulled on his pants.</p><p>Although he thought he could go right back to researching, he was filled with a calm bliss that tempted him to taking a nap. He lay on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple minutes. Then, studying,\u201d he said to himself. He closed his eyes, and slept.</p><hr><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Rose yelled at him. He could hear rustling from the front door.</p><p>He popped up. It was winter, and night had fallen. How long had he been asleep?? He ran to the door to help her with the grocery bags.</p><p>The stars shone over the now pollutionless sky over New London. It was full night. A couple of minutes had turned to several hours of deep, dreamless sleep. He smiled. He had trouble resting, but now the remedy was clear.</p><p>They chatted as they put away the groceries, then Rose ran her fingers through his sleep-tousled hair and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou finally get some good sleep?\u201d She knew about his tossing and turning.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just drifted right off,\u201d he said. There was a certain look in her eyes that he had been oblivious to before, but not anymore. Was it hunger? Curiosity?</p><p>Maybe. But he would foster it. Encourage it, until it spilled over like he had.</p><p>She flushed, then turned to take something out the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye fancy tonight?\u201d she said, bending down to get to the vegetable drawers at the bottom. Her pants stretched enticingly over her bum. The blood rushed to his groin again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m actually not that hungry,\u201d he said breathlessly.</p><p>She turned to look at him, still bent over. Her back arched. \u201cYou sure?\u201d she said. Her eyes searched his face, sensing something different.</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d he replied, leaning back against the counter to take her in.</p><p>She took a little longer than she needed to put away the carrots and celery.</p>",

Thank you so much for reading &lt;3</b></p><hr><p><b><br></b>\u201cAlright, John, I\u2019m off to the shops,\u201d Rose said, putting on her leather jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple hours.\u201d<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d He fidgeted. It had only been a bit more than a week since he arrived, and he was still getting used to Pete\u2019s world.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve nearly eaten me out of house and home,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent every waking moment together. It\u2019d be nice to have some time alone, right? Absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that.\u201d</p><p>In all honesty, Rose was going through a period of adjustment as well. As much as John had the Doctor\u2019s memories and cleverness, he was also the exact physical facsimile of the alien she had loved so deeply she risked the souls of everyone in her universe to touch him again \u2026 but he <i>wasn\u2019t</i> the Doctor. Neither of them. His hearts did not beat a double tattoo in her ear when she dared to put her ear to his chest. He had not traveled to the ends of the universe, lived and loved and lost. After the loss of Nine and Ten, it was difficult to bear.</p><p>John was \u2026 John. And although his physical appearance was the loveliest thing she has ever seen, he was not the man she loved. But she felt she <i>could</i> love him, eventually. In the eight days they had cohabited, there had been golden moments when she saw a flash of the luminary she had once clung to, and she knew there would be more moments. But she wanted the feeling to grow naturally.</p><p>So they still slept very much apart.</p><p>\u201cThe heart,\u201d he said, putting his hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, putting her hand over his. She caressed his prickly face. \u201cAnd remember, you have to shave every day if you want your face to be smooth. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up looking like a mountain man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like that?\u201d he said with a sweet fragility that made her eyes water.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Maybe? He never let-\u201d she stopped talking abruptly. She promised herself she wouldn\u2019t mention the Doctor. It wasn\u2019t fair to John. But in the end, she still couldn\u2019t help it. She missed his honey scent and the galaxies swirling in in his rich brown eyes.</p><p>There were no galaxies in John\u2019s eyes - just twin stars. Lovely, but far less bright.</p><p>She popped in her earpod and walked to the door. \u201cIf you need anything, gimme a bell, okay?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the earpod on the coffee table in front of the holocube. He was still getting very used to the technology.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off, then. You can try to go online if you like. Your bio info is in the cube now,\u201d she said, referring to the advanced computer system. With Mickey\u2019s help, they had been able to hack a new identity for him and enter him into New Britain\u2019s mainframe as a new citizen. To the powers that be, he was an emigre from the South American State.</p><p>He sat down on the sofa and fiddled with the cube. As she was walking out, he popped up suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Rose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you bring a couple boxes of those crumbly berry biscuits? I like those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean jammy dodgers?\u201d her mouth trembled with mirth.</p><p>\u201cThose.\u201d His eyes brightened.</p><p>God, did he love to eat, but his metabolism was so stellar she doubted he would gain a single kilo. \u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd potatoes for mash. And peas. And custard and cake and jam - for trifle. And roast beef, ooh I love that. And crispy sausages and bread and butter for eggy in a basket-\u201d</p><p>She put her hand up. \u201cOkay, okay, I get it. You keep it up and I\u2019ll have to call a zeppelin to get all that stuff back here.\u201d</p><p>He bounced and bit his lower lip. \u201cBut you\u2019ll get the biscuits, at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said with a sigh, and finally walked out the door.</p><hr><p>He was filled with energy. All that talk of food had made him hungry. He opened the fridge and frowned. She was right. It was empty save for some milk and bottles of sauce and milk. He ran his hand over the top of the cupboard, where he knew Rose hid whatever she didn\u2019t want him to devour right away. He felt something promising.</p><p>\u201cJaffa Cakes!\u201d he said, ripping into the box. He grabbed the glass bottle of milk and sat down on the sofa. The holocube flashed.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, John Smith,\u201d a soothing female voice said. Scrolling text and various news stations materialized around him, bombarding him with holographic images. There was a flood in India. And, as usual, America was in the midst of political upheaval.</p><p>The holocube sensed his disinterest. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to see?\u201d</p><p>He chewed his cake and took a sip of milk. The holocube started to play food ads.</p><p>\u201cAdd a little sunshine to their tea,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said, and a holo of a little boy ran by him and to an image of a kitchen table with a big plate of Jaffa cakes. He bit into it enthusiastically and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d he said to the image, and popped the rest of the cake in his mouth.</p><p>Again, the holocube sensed his disinterest. His alpha waves were barely blipping. \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to see?\u201d</p><p>He sucked melted chocolate from his fingers and sighed. \u201cRose, honestly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRose,\u201d it repeated, and multiple windows started popping up around him.</p><p>Flowers. Rows of things - things and people. A flash of frenetic movement caught his eye under the the Rosa centifolia window with all the horticultural information on it.</p><p>He touched the corner of the floating image, and just like in a computer, it came forward. It was an image of a woman touching herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d His eyes grew huge. His lips parted, and heat crawled up his neck and made his cheeks tingle.</p>[[MORE]]<p>This woman. He had never seen anything like it. He felt his chemicals working, and his muscles tightened frightfully. His mouth watered, but he still put down the fresh biscult. He wasn\u2019t hungry anymore.</p><p>The cube noticed the spike in activity in his pleasure center, and more windows started popping up around him, all of them with ladies in various states of undress.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. I-\u201d His lower lip wobbled.</p><p>It was extraordinary. She was so firm. So \u2026 delicious. Saliva flooded his mouth, and blood rushed to his groin.</p><p>He had seen Rose fully clothed - she rarely showed him more than her bare arms, and still he felt a bit breathless when she moved a certain way around him. But this. He was dizzy, and his vision suddenly went telescopic.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He used the new swear word Rose taught him and jumped up. He ached beneath his belly button. He looked down and yelled. His jeans were tented. He touched himself, and the sensation made him groan.</p><p>Sweat dripped down his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is happening?\u201d he asked, using another swear word he didn\u2019t dare use around Rose, but had learned from the holocube programs she loved to watch.</p><p>Another window popped up. Article after article about the male sex response began to glow around him, along with more images of women doing things.</p><p>He touched the closest one, and a very serious article came up.</p><p>\u201c<b>The sexual response cycle refers to the sequence of physical and emotional changes that occur as a person becomes sexually aroused and participates in sexually stimulating activities, including intercourse and masturbation</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntercourse and masturbation?\u201d he said out loud. Another couple of windows popped up, but he kept reading.</p><p>\u201c<b>The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Both men and women experience these phases, although the timing usually is different. For example, it is unlikely that both partners will reach orgasm at the same time</b>.\u201d</p><p><i>Orgasm</i>. The word sounded alien, but promising.</p><p>\u201c<b>Physical and/or psychological stimulation leads to vasodilation and subsequent increased blood flow into the penis. The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the scrotum is pulled tighter, and the testes are pulled up against the body.</b>\u201d</p><p><i>Enlarged and firm.</i> He looked between his legs. <i>Check</i>.</p><p>\u201c<b>With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises, and breathing becomes more rapid.</b>\u201d<br><br>He was panting a bit. And his heartbeat had risen by at least 20 beats per minute.</p><p><i>So it\u2019s normal.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat is sexual stimulation?\u201d He said to the cube.</p><p>\u201c<b>Sexual stimulation is any stimulus (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains sexual arousal, and may lead to orgasm. Stimulation can be by self (e.g., masturbation) or by a sexual partner (sexual intercourse or other sexual activity).</b>\u201d</p><p>There was that word again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is orgasm?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>Orgasm is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or with a sex partner.</b></p><p>\u201cMasturbation,\u201d he read out loud.</p><p>Yet again, images began to flood the holo.</p><p>He made a soft gurgling noise.</p><p>Women do that? Touch themselves like that?</p><p>He swallowed hard. The pain had gone away for a bit while he did his research, but it was back now, and even more intense. He riffled through the images, each one more titillating than the last. He began to feel a strange euphoria. His scientist\u2019s brain repeated back what he just read.</p><p><i>They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations.</i></p><p>His cock pressed insistently on his fly, and it was throbbing. The feeling was both amazing and miserable. His thoughts drifted to Rose.</p><p><i>What do I do with it?</i> He thought. He couldn\u2019t very well shrug and say \u201cI dunno how\u201d if she ever wanted to do something like the women were doing all around him.</p><p>He wanted to learn everything, really research the female sexual response for science, but he couldn\u2019t quite get his thoughts together as easily as usual. It was like there was loud static coming from his groin, drowning out reason. He thought of orgasm - the ultimate discharge of sexual excitement.</p><p>Perhaps, if he could do that, then he could concentrate enough to start his important research. </p><p>He needed to masturbate.</p><p>\u201cMale masturbation,\u201d he said. And now there were cocks everywhere, men with their fists pumping, hairy, groaning, and wet.</p><p>\u201cArrgh!\u201d he said, jumping up and away. \u201cNo more!\u201d</p><p>All the images disappeared. His heart pounded, and the ache had not diminished. He rolled his eyes. Of course all it took was his hand. He could control pressure, speed, and rhythm that way. It made perfect sense.</p><p>He looked around, then ran to the bathroom. The quicker he could finish, the quicker he could get to learning.</p><p>He unbuttoned his jeans and pulled them and his underwear down. Rose\u2019s bathroom had a huge mirror on the door, and he turned to look at himself. He suppressed a giggle. He looked silly - long and slim, like a white oak coat rack with only one hook. He bounced. His cock bounced with him, slapping his belly.</p><p><i>Ooh. That feels mmm.</i></p><p>He did it again. Again it slapped his belly, sending a hot bolt of pleasure up his spine.</p><p><i>Hmmm.</i></p><p>He turned his back on the mirror and licked his palm. All the men had been slick.</p><p>\u201cI just grab it like this-\u201d He wrapped his fist at the base of his cock and pumped quickly as the men had done on the holo - and nearly passed out. He collapsed on the toilet, groaning.</p><p>\u201cShit. Bollocks.<i> Bloody fucking hell</i>,\u201d he said softly, using up his whole swear arsenal. His thigh muscles twitched.</p><p>It was way too much stimulation too soon. His nipples were sensitive to the cloth rubbing against them. Even licking his lips felt different. His response was optimal, but he mustn\u2019t rush it.</p><p><i>Go slow.</i></p><p>He licked his palm again, then wrapped his hand around himself - not too tight, not too loose - and moved it slowly. His foreskin swallowed the swollen head of his cock and the sensation was\u2026</p><p><i>Stellar. The proper word is stellar,</i> he thought.</p><p>He pulled it back and up again, slowly. His toes curled on the tile.</p><p><i>Oh, this is nice.</i></p><p>His balls tightened and the skin warmed, just like the articles stated. Without really thinking, he cupped them with his other hand, caressing them with his thumb.</p><p>He sighed and arched. No article needed to tell him to do that. And it was bloody brilliant.</p><p>He played around with rhythm, barely moving his fist, then pumping up his shaft in overlapping strokes until his fist covered the crown of his cock.</p><p>He moaned loudly, leaning back and spreading his legs.</p><p>His palm was deplorably dry again. Although he didn\u2019t explicitly need more lubrication to finish, he liked the feel of it. He looked around the bathroom.</p><p>Spring rain-scented bath gel? The soap would irritate. Conditioner? That would get messy. Rose\u2019s bath oil? Way too strongly scented, it would be a dead giveaway, since he only took showers. His eyes drifted to the bottle of lotion by the sink.</p><p><b>Ultra-moisturizing</b>, it exclaimed right on the label. <b>Unscented</b>.</p><p>Perfect. He squirted it into his palm and slathered it on himself. He felt silly again, but only until he slowly slid his cock into his lotion-slick hand. He steadied his fist against the counter and began to pump his hips.</p><p>His head spun.</p><p>This sensation was not in the vast catalog of knowledge the Doctor had given to him. It was a swelling madness. Potential energy in its most beautiful manifestation. He was a river right before it spilled over the lip of a waterfall.</p><p>He pumped faster, and his breath quickened with his thrusts.</p><p>With a woman, with <i>her</i>, how would it be? Would she love it like he did, feel the same dumb beauty in it? His thoughts unraveled into pure sensation.</p><p>The women. Their faces. The sounds they made, when they touched themselves. Their breasts, mysterious orbs, each topped with swollen buds his lips parted to suck. Them, and the silky, hot cleft which he knew was a million times better than his lubed fist.</p><p>All of them had it. Every pretty girl he met as Rose showed him around London.</p><p>So soft.</p><p>And she had it too. She hid it, like they all did, but she had it. And he knew of her unfulfilled desires toward the Doctor. He also knew why the Doctor, regardless of his desire, had abstained.</p><p>But <i>he</i> didn\u2019t have to. He was human, and whole, and eager.</p><p>He looked down at himself. His belly muscles were tight with his impending release. His brow was wet with sweat, and his moans were loud and exultant.</p><p>He would share this with Rose, if she would have him. She could teach him all she knew, and he would learn her.</p><p><i>Every</i>- he felt the spike in heart rate.</p><p><i>Delicious</i>- a deep euphoria, much more intense and full, rose from between his legs, pinged past his heart and shot straight to his brain.</p><p><i>Inch</i>- he grunted as his cock pulsed and spurted onto the vanity mirror. His eyes rolled back and he felt the pleasure sluice through him, over and over, a pleasantly fading echo.</p><p>He let his heart slow, then took a deep, shuddering breath and stretched. His reflection in the mirror was flushed and sated. He smiled at himself. Even his blinking has slowed. He cleaned the evidence and pulled on his pants.</p><p>Although he thought he could go right back to researching, he was filled with a calm bliss that tempted him to taking a nap. He lay on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cJust a couple minutes. Then, studying,\u201d he said to himself. He closed his eyes, and slept.</p><hr><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d Rose yelled at him. He could hear rustling from the front door.</p><p>He popped up. It was winter, and night had fallen. How long had he been asleep?? He ran to the door to help her with the grocery bags.</p><p>The stars shone over the now pollutionless sky over New London. It was full night. A couple of minutes had turned to several hours of deep, dreamless sleep. He smiled. He had trouble resting, but now the remedy was clear.</p><p>They chatted as they put away the groceries, then Rose ran her fingers through his sleep-tousled hair and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou finally get some good sleep?\u201d She knew about his tossing and turning.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just drifted right off,\u201d he said. There was a certain look in her eyes that he had been oblivious to before, but not anymore. Was it hunger? Curiosity?</p><p>Maybe. But he would foster it. Encourage it, until it spilled over like he had.</p><p>She flushed, then turned to take something out the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye fancy tonight?\u201d she said, bending down to get to the vegetable drawers at the bottom. Her pants stretched enticingly over her bum. The blood rushed to his groin again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m actually not that hungry,\u201d he said breathlessly.</p><p>She turned to look at him, still bent over. Her back arched. \u201cYou sure?\u201d she said. Her eyes searched his face, sensing something different.</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d he replied, leaning back against the counter to take her in.</p><p>She took a little longer than she needed to put away the carrots and celery.</p>",

He ran his hand over the top of the cupboard, where he knew Rose hid whatever she didn&rsquo;t want him to devour right away. He felt something promising.</p><p>&ldquo;Jaffa Cakes!&rdquo; he said, ripping into the box. He grabbed the glass bottle of milk and sat down on the sofa. The holocube flashed.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome, John Smith,&rdquo; a soothing female voice said. Scrolling text and various news stations materialized around him, bombarding him with holographic images. There was a flood in India. And, as usual, America was in the midst of political upheaval.</p><p>The holocube sensed his disinterest. &ldquo;Is there anything you&rsquo;d like to see?&rdquo;</p><p>He chewed his cake and took a sip of milk. The holocube started to play food ads.</p><p>&ldquo;Add a little sunshine to their tea,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice said, and a holo of a little boy ran by him and to an image of a kitchen table with a big plate of Jaffa cakes. He bit into it enthusiastically and smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit,&rdquo; he said to the image, and popped the rest of the cake in his mouth.</p><p>Again, the holocube sensed his disinterest. His alpha waves were barely blipping. &ldquo;Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to see?&rdquo;</p><p>He sucked melted chocolate from his fingers and sighed. &ldquo;Rose, honestly,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Rose,&rdquo; it repeated, and multiple windows started popping up around him.</p><p>Flowers. Rows of things - things and people. A flash of frenetic movement caught his eye under the the Rosa centifolia window with all the horticultural information on it.</p><p>He touched the corner of the floating image, and just like in a computer, it came forward. It was an image of a woman touching herself.</p><p>&ldquo;What the-&rdquo; His eyes grew huge. His lips parted, and heat crawled up his neck and made his cheeks tingle.</p><p>This woman. He had never seen anything like it. He felt his chemicals working, and his muscles tightened frightfully. His mouth watered, but he still put down the fresh biscult. He wasn&rsquo;t hungry anymore.</p><p>The cube noticed the spike in activity in his pleasure center, and more windows started popping up around him, all of them with ladies in various states of undress.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. My. I-&rdquo; His lower lip wobbled.</p><p>It was extraordinary. She was so firm. So &hellip; delicious. Saliva flooded his mouth, and blood rushed to his groin.</p><p>He had seen Rose fully clothed - she rarely showed him more than her bare arms, and still he felt a bit breathless when she moved a certain way around him. But this. He was dizzy, and his vision suddenly went telescopic.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; He used the new swear word Rose taught him and jumped up. He ached beneath his belly button. He looked down and yelled. His jeans were tented. He touched himself, and the sensation made him groan.</p><p>Sweat dripped down his back.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck is happening?&rdquo; he asked, using another swear word he didn&rsquo;t dare use around Rose, but had learned from the holocube programs she loved to watch.</p><p>Another window popped up. Article after article about the male sex response began to glow around him, along with more images of women doing things.</p><p>He touched the closest one, and a very serious article came up.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>The sexual response cycle refers to the sequence of physical and emotional changes that occur as a person becomes sexually aroused and participates in sexually stimulating activities, including intercourse and masturbation</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Intercourse and masturbation?&rdquo; he said out loud. Another couple of windows popped up, but he kept reading.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>The sexual response cycle has four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Both men and women experience these phases, although the timing usually is different. For example, it is unlikely that both partners will reach orgasm at the same time</b>.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Orgasm</i>. The word sounded alien, but promising.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Physical and/or psychological stimulation leads to vasodilation and subsequent increased blood flow into the penis. The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the scrotum is pulled tighter, and the testes are pulled up against the body.</b>&rdquo;</p><p><i>Enlarged and firm.</i> He looked between his legs. <i>Check</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises, and breathing becomes more rapid.</b>&rdquo;<br /><br />He was panting a bit. And his heartbeat had risen by at least 20 beats per minute.</p><p><i>So it&rsquo;s normal.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What is sexual stimulation?&rdquo; He said to the cube.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Sexual stimulation is any stimulus (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains sexual arousal, and may lead to orgasm. Stimulation can be by self (e.g., masturbation) or by a sexual partner (sexual intercourse or other sexual activity).</b>&rdquo;</p><p>There was that word again.</p><p>&ldquo;What is orgasm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Orgasm is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation can be by self-practice (masturbation) or with a sex partner.</b></p><p>&ldquo;Masturbation,&rdquo; he read out loud.</p><p>Yet again, images began to flood the holo.</p><p>He made a soft gurgling noise.</p><p>Women do that? Touch themselves like that?</p><p>He swallowed hard. The pain had gone away for a bit while he did his research, but it was back now, and even more intense. He riffled through the images, each one more titillating than the last. He began to feel a strange euphoria. His scientist&rsquo;s brain repeated back what he just read.</p><p><i>They are often associated with other involuntary actions, including muscular spasms in multiple areas of the body, a general euphoric sensation and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations.</i></p><p>His cock pressed insistently on his fly, and it was throbbing. The feeling was both amazing and miserable. His thoughts drifted to Rose.</p><p><i>What do I do with it?</i> He thought. He couldn&rsquo;t very well shrug and say &ldquo;I dunno how&rdquo; if she ever wanted to do something like the women were doing all around him.</p><p>He wanted to learn everything, really research the female sexual response for science, but he couldn&rsquo;t quite get his thoughts together as easily as usual. It was like there was loud static coming from his groin, drowning out reason. He thought of orgasm - the ultimate discharge of sexual excitement.</p><p>Perhaps, if he could do that, then he could concentrate enough to start his important research. </p><p>He needed to masturbate.</p><p>&ldquo;Male masturbation,&rdquo; he said. And now there were cocks everywhere, men with their fists pumping, hairy, groaning, and wet.</p><p>&ldquo;Arrgh!&rdquo; he said, jumping up and away. &ldquo;No more!&rdquo;</p><p>All the images disappeared. His heart pounded, and the ache had not diminished. He rolled his eyes. Of course all it took was his hand. He could control pressure, speed, and rhythm that way. It made perfect sense.</p><p>He looked around, then ran to the bathroom. The quicker he could finish, the quicker he could get to learning.</p><p>He unbuttoned his jeans and pulled them and his underwear down. Rose&rsquo;s bathroom had a huge mirror on the door, and he turned to look at himself. He suppressed a giggle. He looked silly - long and slim, like a white oak coat rack with only one hook. He bounced. His cock bounced with him, slapping his belly.</p><p><i>Ooh. That feels mmm.</i></p><p>He did it again. Again it slapped his belly, sending a hot bolt of pleasure up his spine.</p><p><i>Hmmm.</i></p><p>He turned his back on the mirror and licked his palm. All the men had been slick.</p><p>&ldquo;I just grab it like this-&rdquo; He wrapped his fist at the base of his cock and pumped quickly as the men had done on the holo - and nearly passed out. He collapsed on the toilet, groaning.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit. Bollocks.<i> Bloody fucking hell</i>,&rdquo; he said softly, using up his whole swear arsenal. His thigh muscles twitched.</p><p>It was way too much stimulation too soon. His nipples were sensitive to the cloth rubbing against them. Even licking his lips felt different. His response was optimal, but he mustn&rsquo;t rush it.</p><p><i>Go slow.</i></p><p>He licked his palm again, then wrapped his hand around himself - not too tight, not too loose - and moved it slowly. His foreskin swallowed the swollen head of his cock and the sensation was&hellip;</p><p><i>Stellar. The proper word is stellar,</i> he thought.</p><p>He pulled it back and up again, slowly. His toes curled on the tile.</p><p><i>Oh, this is nice.</i></p><p>His balls tightened and the skin warmed, just like the articles stated. Without really thinking, he cupped them with his other hand, caressing them with his thumb.</p><p>He sighed and arched. No article needed to tell him to do that. And it was bloody brilliant.</p><p>He played around with rhythm, barely moving his fist, then pumping up his shaft in overlapping strokes until his fist covered the crown of his cock.</p><p>He moaned loudly, leaning back and spreading his legs.</p><p>His palm was deplorably dry again. Although he didn&rsquo;t explicitly need more lubrication to finish, he liked the feel of it. He looked around the bathroom.</p><p>Spring rain-scented bath gel? The soap would irritate. Conditioner? That would get messy. Rose&rsquo;s bath oil? Way too strongly scented, it would be a dead giveaway, since he only took showers. His eyes drifted to the bottle of lotion by the sink.</p><p><b>Ultra-moisturizing</b>, it exclaimed right on the label. <b>Unscented</b>.</p><p>Perfect. He squirted it into his palm and slathered it on himself. He felt silly again, but only until he slowly slid his cock into his lotion-slick hand. He steadied his fist against the counter and began to pump his hips.</p><p>His head spun.</p><p>This sensation was not in the vast catalog of knowledge the Doctor had given to him. It was a swelling madness. Potential energy in its most beautiful manifestation. He was a river right before it spilled over the lip of a waterfall.</p><p>He pumped faster, and his breath quickened with his thrusts.</p><p>With a woman, with <i>her</i>, how would it be? Would she love it like he did, feel the same dumb beauty in it? His thoughts unraveled into pure sensation.</p><p>The women. Their faces. The sounds they made, when they touched themselves. Their breasts, mysterious orbs, each topped with swollen buds his lips parted to suck. Them, and the silky, hot cleft which he knew was a million times better than his lubed fist.</p><p>All of them had it. Every pretty girl he met as Rose showed him around London.</p><p>So soft.</p><p>And she had it too. She hid it, like they all did, but she had it. And he knew of her unfulfilled desires toward the Doctor. He also knew why the Doctor, regardless of his desire, had abstained.</p><p>But <i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t have to. He was human, and whole, and eager.</p><p>He looked down at himself. His belly muscles were tight with his impending release. His brow was wet with sweat, and his moans were loud and exultant.</p><p>He would share this with Rose, if she would have him. She could teach him all she knew, and he would learn her.</p><p><i>Every</i>- he felt the spike in heart rate.</p><p><i>Delicious</i>- a deep euphoria, much more intense and full, rose from between his legs, pinged past his heart and shot straight to his brain.</p><p><i>Inch</i>- he grunted as his cock pulsed and spurted onto the vanity mirror. His eyes rolled back and he felt the pleasure sluice through him, over and over, a pleasantly fading echo.</p><p>He let his heart slow, then took a deep, shuddering breath and stretched. His reflection in the mirror was flushed and sated. He smiled at himself. Even his blinking has slowed. He cleaned the evidence and pulled on his pants.</p><p>Although he thought he could go right back to researching, he was filled with a calm bliss that tempted him to taking a nap. He lay on the sofa.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a couple minutes. Then, studying,&rdquo; he said to himself. He closed his eyes, and slept.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; Rose yelled at him. He could hear rustling from the front door.</p><p>He popped up. It was winter, and night had fallen. How long had he been asleep?? He ran to the door to help her with the grocery bags.</p><p>The stars shone over the now pollutionless sky over New London. It was full night. A couple of minutes had turned to several hours of deep, dreamless sleep. He smiled. He had trouble resting, but now the remedy was clear.</p><p>They chatted as they put away the groceries, then Rose ran her fingers through his sleep-tousled hair and smiled up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You finally get some good sleep?&rdquo; She knew about his tossing and turning.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Just drifted right off,&rdquo; he said. There was a certain look in her eyes that he had been oblivious to before, but not anymore. Was it hunger? Curiosity?</p><p>Maybe. But he would foster it. Encourage it, until it spilled over like he had.</p><p>She flushed, then turned to take something out the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye fancy tonight?&rdquo; she said, bending down to get to the vegetable drawers at the bottom. Her pants stretched enticingly over her bum. The blood rushed to his groin again.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m actually not that hungry,&rdquo; he said breathlessly.</p><p>She turned to look at him, still bent over. Her back arched. &ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; she said. Her eyes searched his face, sensing something different.</p><p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; he replied, leaning back against the counter to take her in.</p><p>She took a little longer than she needed to put away the carrots and celery.</p>",

Thank you so much for reading &lt;3</b></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b><br /></b>&ldquo;Alright, John, I&rsquo;m off to the shops,&rdquo; Rose said, putting on her leather jacket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a couple hours.&rdquo;<b><br /></b></p>\n<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; He fidgeted. It had only been a bit more than a week since he arrived, and he was still getting used to Pete&rsquo;s world.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve nearly eaten me out of house and home,&rdquo; she said, smiling at him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve spent every waking moment together. It&rsquo;d be nice to have some time alone, right? Absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In all honesty, Rose was going through a period of adjustment as well. As much as John had the Doctor&rsquo;s memories and cleverness, he was also the exact physical facsimile of the alien she had loved so deeply she risked the souls of everyone in her universe to touch him again &hellip; but he <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> the Doctor. Neither of them. His hearts did not beat a double tattoo in her ear when she dared to put her ear to his chest. He had not traveled to the ends of the universe, lived and loved and lost. After the loss of Nine and Ten, it was difficult to bear.</p>\n<p>John was &hellip; John. And although his physical appearance was the loveliest thing she has ever seen, he was not the man she loved. But she felt she <i>could</i> love him, eventually. In the eight days they had cohabited, there had been golden moments when she saw a flash of the luminary she had once clung to, and she knew there would be more moments. But she wanted the feeling to grow naturally.</p>\n<p>So they still slept very much apart.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The heart,&rdquo; he said, putting his hand to his chest.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, putting her hand over his. She caressed his prickly face. &ldquo;And remember, you have to shave every day if you want your face to be smooth. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll end up looking like a mountain man.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t like that?&rdquo; he said with a sweet fragility that made her eyes water.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I dunno. Maybe? He never let-&rdquo; she stopped talking abruptly. She promised herself she wouldn&rsquo;t mention the Doctor. It wasn&rsquo;t fair to John. But in the end, she still couldn&rsquo;t help it. She missed his honey scent and the galaxies swirling in in his rich brown eyes.</p>\n<p>There were no galaxies in John&rsquo;s eyes - just twin stars. Lovely, but far less bright.</p>\n<p>She popped in her earpod and walked to the door. &ldquo;If you need anything, gimme a bell, okay?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He stared at the earpod on the coffee table in front of the holocube. He was still getting very used to the technology.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off, then. You can try to go online if you like. Your bio info is in the cube now,&rdquo; she said, referring to the advanced computer system. With Mickey&rsquo;s help, they had been able to hack a new identity for him and enter him into New Britain&rsquo;s mainframe as a new citizen. To the powers that be, he was an emigre from the South American State.</p>\n<p>He sat down on the sofa and fiddled with the cube. As she was walking out, he popped up suddenly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rose!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Could you bring a couple boxes of those crumbly berry biscuits? I like those.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You mean jammy dodgers?&rdquo; her mouth trembled with mirth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Those.&rdquo; His eyes brightened.</p>\n<p>God, did he love to eat, but his metabolism was so stellar she doubted he would gain a single kilo. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And potatoes for mash. And peas. And custard and cake and jam - for trifle. And roast beef, ooh I love that. And crispy sausages and bread and butter for eggy in a basket-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She put her hand up. &ldquo;Okay, okay, I get it. You keep it up and I&rsquo;ll have to call a zeppelin to get all that stuff back here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He bounced and bit his lower lip. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll get the biscuits, at least?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, and finally walked out the door.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>He was filled with energy.

Talk about pressure. Talk about iconic moments - we\u2019d been building our whole story up to that one scene. My problem with that scene was how many times could I shoot this scene favoring Billie? How many times do I have to shoot it with her doing the dialogue for David and ask her to get emotional? On the morning we were doing the scene, I met Billie and David in the make-up caravan, and I asked how they wanted to do it. I explained the shots I wanted to get, so they would know how many times I needed to do the scene. But who was I going to shoot in close-up first? I was worried for Billie, to be honest. They\u2019d obviously discussed it, because there was a little look between them, and then David told me to do Billie first. Billie said she\u2019d probably got two takes in her and then the tears would be all dried up. Well, the first take was magnificent, you couldn\u2019t top it. She gave it everything and it was brilliant. Unfortunately, her nose looked very cold - it was a freezing January day on the coldest, most open to the wind beach anywhere, and there was something running down her nose. I felt that I couldn\u2019t cut it because she was right in the middle of it, so I allowed her to get to the end of the scene, then went over and told her it was the best scene I\u2019d ever directed in my life. Which it was, no argument. Then I had to explain that during the latter part something had come down her face. I asked her if she would do it again, and I know she was upset, she wasn\u2019t rude or aggressive to me, but she was clearly upset because she\u2019d given it so much. We did it again and it was even better but, this time, her hair was blown all over her face. \u00a0In the end I used most of the second take and covered any moment that the hair was in the way by using bits from the first take. And what you see is a fantastic performance. And then David\u2019s performance is fantastic too. It\u2019s her scene and he gives her the moment. He wasn\u2019t going to let her down in any way and between them, they create a fantastic ending.</p></blockquote><p>\n\nOther parts of this post: [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/82342548256/behind-the-scenes-of-doomsday\" target=\"_blank\">One</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/100325734507/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghosts-doomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Two</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/109013449294/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghosts-doomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Three</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/163563659417/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghostsdoomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Four</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/166640350280/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghostsdoomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Five</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/169925160828/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghostsdoomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Six</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/172927682689/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghostsdoomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Seven</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/175643403519/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghostsdoomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Eight</a>] [<a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/post/178573340756/behind-the-scenes-of-army-of-ghostsdoomsday-part\" target=\"_blank\">Nine</a>]<br/>[ <a href=\"http://mizgnomer.tumblr.com/bts\" target=\"_blank\">All Behind-the-Scenes posts available here</a> ]\n\n</p>",

Talk about pressure. Talk about iconic moments - we\u2019d been building our whole story up to that one scene. My problem with that scene was how many times could I shoot this scene favoring Billie? How many times do I have to shoot it with her doing the dialogue for David and ask her to get emotional? On the morning we were doing the scene, I met Billie and David in the make-up caravan, and I asked how they wanted to do it. I explained the shots I wanted to get, so they would know how many times I needed to do the scene. But who was I going to shoot in close-up first? I was worried for Billie, to be honest. They\u2019d obviously discussed it, because there was a little look between them, and then David told me to do Billie first. Billie said she\u2019d probably got two takes in her and then the tears would be all dried up. Well, the first take was magnificent, you couldn\u2019t top it. She gave it everything and it was brilliant. Unfortunately, her nose looked very cold - it was a freezing January day on the coldest, most open to the wind beach anywhere, and there was something running down her nose. I felt that I couldn\u2019t cut it because she was right in the middle of it, so I allowed her to get to the end of the scene, then went over and told her it was the best scene I\u2019d ever directed in my life. Which it was, no argument. Then I had to explain that during the latter part something had come down her face. I asked her if she would do it again, and I know she was upset, she wasn\u2019t rude or aggressive to me, but she was clearly upset because she\u2019d given it so much. We did it again and it was even better but, this time, her hair was blown all over her face. \u00a0In the end I used most of the second take and covered any moment that the hair was in the way by using bits from the first take.
