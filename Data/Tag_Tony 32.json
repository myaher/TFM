There&rsquo;s no sign, no nothing. And no people around, as well. How is she ever going to find the counselor&rsquo;s office if she doesn&rsquo;t know where it is?!</p><p>Y/N begins to walk towards the end of the hall she has not yet discovered. Couldn&rsquo;t go wrong walking here, she thinks to herself. But suddenly, out of the silence and loneliness, she hears footsteps. Lousy, loud as well, probably belonging to a guy. She stops, hoping he&rsquo;s one of the students and can tell her where to go.</p><p>It is a guy, indeed, and he wants to tap her shoulder with his pointer finger to alert her with his presence, but she&rsquo;s already turning around. He&rsquo;s a bit late to withdraw his hand and it hangs in the air as he stares at the completely breathtaking stranger.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He says and raises his eyebrows. Y/N eyes his hand warily and furrows her eyebrows. The guy immediately retracts his hand and lets it fall by his side.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWow what?\u201d She asks, straightening her posture and taking a small step back from him. She does this everytime she meets someone new because she is a bit afraid of every stranger. But this stranger&hellip; well, his good looks certainly earn him first-impression trust. It shouldn&rsquo;t be taken deeper, though, she knows that.<br/></p><p>\u201cWow you.\u201d He says.\u00a0\u201cYou, I found you, I was looking for you. And now I found you, and I say wow.\u201d He speaks in a fast manner and Y/N has to take a short while to figure out what she heard.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, um,\u201d she starts to say,\u00a0\u201cwh-why were you looking for me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI am to,\u201d he starts now, and bends a little, extracting his arm to her, in an old-fashioned polite manner,\u00a0\u201cshow you around your\u2014obviously\u2014new school.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>She laughs and he lingers on how it looks. A spectacular apparition, her laugh and smile. And that he&rsquo;s caused it\u2014miraculous. He stands back up and straightens his jacket, smiling sheepishly at the girl. She&rsquo;s the most charming girl he&rsquo;s ever seen, he&rsquo;s sure of it. Her charms seem to be quite unplanned and natural. And her smile. <i>Oh, her smile.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Y/N says.\u00a0\u201cI thought I was lost on my first day already.\u201d She offers him a nervous smile and he gives her a wider in response. Though when she sees it, he narrows it down to a polite smile. He&rsquo;s shy. He&rsquo;s shy?<i> Tony Stark&rsquo;s shy?</i> Of a stranger? A<i> damn</i> beautiful one at that.\u00a0\u201cHello? I don&rsquo;t know your name, but you seem to have drifted, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we&rsquo;re going.\u201d He says and starts walking in the direction Y/N was already headed to.\u00a0\u201cI should probably tell you who I am.\u201d He says it in a way that makes her think she should know his name, know who he is. As if it&rsquo;s a fact.\u00a0\u201cI&rsquo;m Tony. Tony Stark.\u201d He extends his hand towards her again and this time, she shakes it. Even if she is unsure of the horrid formality of his gestures.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m Y/N.\u201d She says in response and realises she doesn&rsquo;t know his name, even if she&rsquo;s supposed to.\u00a0\u201cI would say my last name, but since yours is much more brighter and cooler, I won&rsquo;t.\u201d She admits.<br/></p><p>\u201cRidiculous!\u201d Tony says.\u00a0\u201cAlthough, thank you, I know it&rsquo;s cool. Or whatever.\u201d He takes it as a compliment, due to his arrogant ways. Back to my own self, at least, he thinks. Y/N feels a bit awkward from his comment, so she says nothing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Y/N asks queitly, filling the silence of footsteps and their echoes in the hallway.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTo the office, sweetheart.\u201d Tony replies.\u00a0\u201cYou&rsquo;ll get your schedule and since you&rsquo;re with me, and since I'm\u2014<i>well</i>\u2014me, I&rsquo;ll show you around the school and no teachers will complain that you&rsquo;re absent!\u201d He says, a bit too excitedly maybe, and Y/N has to look at him to be sure that he&rsquo;s really that giddy. Because of her?<br/></p><p>Surely a guy like him wouldn&rsquo;t be affected in any way by her. She&rsquo;s just not that&hellip; what he would want. Anyhow. Would she miss the first lessons? But would it be so bad? Passing one day to spend with him? This incredibly handsome stranger Tony.\u00a0</p><p>How could she actually say no to him? Well, she couldn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s the thing. She couldn&rsquo;t deny him, and that&rsquo;s her weakness. Pretty strangers make her succumb, and it&rsquo;s not always a good thing. But, alas, this is not a bar, and he&rsquo;s no creepy guy, so there should be no problem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if I fail this semester because I&rsquo;ve missed a lesson today, I&rsquo;m blaming you.\u201d She points a mean finger at Tony, which he moves away and leaves them both standing closer than just-met strangers would. Y/N blinks a couple of times, lost in his eyes.<br/></p><p>They&rsquo;re a beautiful shade of brown. A raging, anxious, active, but comforting, deep brown. Beautiful. And he got lost in her eyes, as well, what a coincidence. They&rsquo;re anxious, like his, he sees, and finds comfort in that. But they&rsquo;re calming, too. The orbs are understanding and look like the deepest ocean.</p><p>\u201cI'm\u00a0sure I can take the blame.\u201d He says, talking quieter than before, the foolish smile gone from his features. A blush invades her cheeks and she looks down, looks away from Tony. He closes his eyes for a second, but then turns and starts walking again down the hallway, Y/N following him soon after. She&rsquo;s shy now, they&rsquo;ve both gotten shy. Tony doesn&rsquo;t speak a thing. How strange for his usual behavior that Y/N knows nothing of.\u00a0\u201cSo, uh, any plans for the summer?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cTony, it has just ended.\u201d Y/N says to him and Tony almost faints. The way she says his name. So innocently, so purely and shyly. He&rsquo;s ready to give her his heart.\u00a0\u201cSummer&rsquo;s next year.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cStill, have any plans already?\u201d He repeats his question. Tony&rsquo;s realised his clumsiness but tries to make it better, still tries to keep up a conversation with the beautiful creature.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I don&rsquo;t think so.\u201d She responds.\u00a0\u201cProbably sleeping. I get very tired during the school year.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFrom all the studying and working hard and late?\u201d Tony asks, a knowing grin on his lips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cQuite so.\u201d Y/N confirms.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you?\u201d She looks at him, wicked and interested eyes looking into Tony&rsquo;s.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cA year&rsquo;s the same all around for me, hon.\u201d He admits sorely.\u00a0\u201cBut I would like to join you in sleeping some day.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N can&rsquo;t stop the playful scoff, although full of shock, that leaves her mouth. She feels it&rsquo;s impolite to Tony - if he was either way horribly joking or trying to flirt. But he enjoys it, hearing and seeing her laugh. But he was serious.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShow me around first, then we&rsquo;ll talk of possible, uh, sleeping.\u201d Y/N says to him, patting Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. That&rsquo;s strange, he&rsquo;s never had someone playing with him like that. Everyone is always serious and modest towards him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ll strongly take that as permission.\u201d Tony tells her. She only laughs quietly, more to herself than Tony. And she shakes her head. He&rsquo;s unbelievably sure of himself.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Even though they are faintly flirting and catching glimpses at one another, as well as knowing there&rsquo;s some kind of attraction to each other, they don&rsquo;t otherwise speak of it out loud. That would be a crime! They&rsquo;ve only known each other for two or three minutes, not known, but met.\u00a0</p><p>But they know, they knew from that moment, that they were undeniably and absolutely smitten by each other.\u00a0</p><p><i><b>Permanent taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Fn1LMWSi3hPIi-pM2VvIw\">@v0idbella</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myp6-ebXFSnmbRvVG_6ajxQ\">@inlovewithmiddleagedcelebs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCLflR0WHRxVP1doqzxz4tg\">@works-of-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfRqkkjEf4Lhj1SZ9DYxX8g\">@destiel-stucky4ever-loki-queen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3ZgO8FG57WFSAS3R9LwHrg\">@stfxlou</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn0M4sV4CXbsKTQVveteEKA\">@ur-gunna-h8-ths</a> @one-taylor-one-vision <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZwG5bvLx8te_rqYc8wfzyg\">@empressdreams</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcAcaezGltNzSf8yY_zi9RA\">@betweenloveandfire</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrF7w10ZYMQgWgvDafwNabg\">@but-legendsneverdie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZdrAeErT2q1WGEqKcdUBWg\">@deardeacy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRq-Z7vA_xbE6JaKhFvoI9w\">@mavieesttriste16</a> @fvckyeahbenhardy <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllQCAkmLv_V_veFFXcZPiA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllQCAkmLv_V_veFFXcZPiA\">@thewinchesterchronicles</a></b></i><br/></p><p><i>A/N: Forgive the ending, it sounds like a corny teen movie&rsquo;s beginning narration.

How is she ever going to find the counselor\u2019s office if she doesn\u2019t know where it is?!</p><p>Y/N begins to walk towards the end of the hall she has not yet discovered. Couldn\u2019t go wrong walking here, she thinks to herself. But suddenly, out of the silence and loneliness, she hears footsteps. Lousy, loud as well, probably belonging to a guy. She stops, hoping he\u2019s one of the students and can tell her where to go.</p><p>It is a guy, indeed, and he wants to tap her shoulder with his pointer finger to alert her with his presence, but she\u2019s already turning around. He\u2019s a bit late to withdraw his hand and it hangs in the air as he stares at the completely breathtaking stranger.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He says and raises his eyebrows. Y/N eyes his hand warily and furrows her eyebrows. The guy immediately retracts his hand and lets it fall by his side.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWow what?\u201d She asks, straightening her posture and taking a small step back from him. She does this everytime she meets someone new because she is a bit afraid of every stranger. But this stranger\u2026 well, his good looks certainly earn him first-impression trust. It shouldn\u2019t be taken deeper, though, she knows that.<br></p><p>\u201cWow you.\u201d He says.\u00a0\u201cYou, I found you, I was looking for you. And now I found you, and I say wow.\u201d He speaks in a fast manner and Y/N has to take a short while to figure out what she heard.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, um,\u201d she starts to say,\u00a0\u201cwh-why were you looking for me?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI am to,\u201d he starts now, and bends a little, extracting his arm to her, in an old-fashioned polite manner,\u00a0\u201cshow you around your\u2014obviously\u2014new school.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>She laughs and he lingers on how it looks. A spectacular apparition, her laugh and smile. And that he\u2019s caused it\u2014miraculous. He stands back up and straightens his jacket, smiling sheepishly at the girl. She\u2019s the most charming girl he\u2019s ever seen, he\u2019s sure of it. Her charms seem to be quite unplanned and natural. And her smile. <i>Oh, her smile.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Y/N says.\u00a0\u201cI thought I was lost on my first day already.\u201d She offers him a nervous smile and he gives her a wider in response. Though when she sees it, he narrows it down to a polite smile. He\u2019s shy. He\u2019s shy?<i> Tony Stark\u2019s shy?</i> Of a stranger? A<i> damn</i> beautiful one at that.\u00a0\u201cHello? I don\u2019t know your name, but you seem to have drifted, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re going.\u201d He says and starts walking in the direction Y/N was already headed to.\u00a0\u201cI should probably tell you who I am.\u201d He says it in a way that makes her think she should know his name, know who he is. As if it\u2019s a fact.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m Tony. Tony Stark.\u201d He extends his hand towards her again and this time, she shakes it. Even if she is unsure of the horrid formality of his gestures.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d She says in response and realises she doesn\u2019t know his name, even if she\u2019s supposed to.\u00a0\u201cI would say my last name, but since yours is much more brighter and cooler, I won\u2019t.\u201d She admits.<br></p><p>\u201cRidiculous!\u201d Tony says.\u00a0\u201cAlthough, thank you, I know it\u2019s cool. Or whatever.\u201d He takes it as a compliment, due to his arrogant ways. Back to my own self, at least, he thinks. Y/N feels a bit awkward from his comment, so she says nothing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Y/N asks queitly, filling the silence of footsteps and their echoes in the hallway.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTo the office, sweetheart.\u201d Tony replies.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll get your schedule and since you\u2019re with me, and since I'm\u2014<i>well</i>\u2014me, I\u2019ll show you around the school and no teachers will complain that you\u2019re absent!\u201d He says, a bit too excitedly maybe, and Y/N has to look at him to be sure that he\u2019s really that giddy. Because of her?<br></p><p>Surely a guy like him wouldn\u2019t be affected in any way by her. She\u2019s just not that\u2026 what he would want. Anyhow. Would she miss the first lessons? But would it be so bad? Passing one day to spend with him? This incredibly handsome stranger Tony.\u00a0</p><p>How could she actually say no to him? Well, she couldn\u2019t, that\u2019s the thing. She couldn\u2019t deny him, and that\u2019s her weakness. Pretty strangers make her succumb, and it\u2019s not always a good thing. But, alas, this is not a bar, and he\u2019s no creepy guy, so there should be no problem.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if I fail this semester because I\u2019ve missed a lesson today, I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d She points a mean finger at Tony, which he moves away and leaves them both standing closer than just-met strangers would. Y/N blinks a couple of times, lost in his eyes.<br></p><p>They\u2019re a beautiful shade of brown. A raging, anxious, active, but comforting, deep brown. Beautiful. And he got lost in her eyes, as well, what a coincidence. They\u2019re anxious, like his, he sees, and finds comfort in that. But they\u2019re calming, too. The orbs are understanding and look like the deepest ocean.</p><p>\u201cI'm\u00a0sure I can take the blame.\u201d He says, talking quieter than before, the foolish smile gone from his features. A blush invades her cheeks and she looks down, looks away from Tony. He closes his eyes for a second, but then turns and starts walking again down the hallway, Y/N following him soon after. She\u2019s shy now, they\u2019ve both gotten shy. Tony doesn\u2019t speak a thing. How strange for his usual behavior that Y/N knows nothing of.\u00a0\u201cSo, uh, any plans for the summer?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cTony, it has just ended.\u201d Y/N says to him and Tony almost faints. The way she says his name. So innocently, so purely and shyly. He\u2019s ready to give her his heart.\u00a0\u201cSummer\u2019s next year.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cStill, have any plans already?\u201d He repeats his question. Tony\u2019s realised his clumsiness but tries to make it better, still tries to keep up a conversation with the beautiful creature.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She responds.\u00a0\u201cProbably sleeping. I get very tired during the school year.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFrom all the studying and working hard and late?\u201d Tony asks, a knowing grin on his lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cQuite so.\u201d Y/N confirms.\u00a0\u201cWhat about you?\u201d She looks at him, wicked and interested eyes looking into Tony\u2019s.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cA year\u2019s the same all around for me, hon.\u201d He admits sorely.\u00a0\u201cBut I would like to join you in sleeping some day.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N can\u2019t stop the playful scoff, although full of shock, that leaves her mouth. She feels it\u2019s impolite to Tony - if he was either way horribly joking or trying to flirt. But he enjoys it, hearing and seeing her laugh. But he was serious.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShow me around first, then we\u2019ll talk of possible, uh, sleeping.\u201d Y/N says to him, patting Tony\u2019s shoulder. That\u2019s strange, he\u2019s never had someone playing with him like that. Everyone is always serious and modest towards him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll strongly take that as permission.\u201d Tony tells her. She only laughs quietly, more to herself than Tony. And she shakes her head. He\u2019s unbelievably sure of himself.\u00a0<br></p><p>Even though they are faintly flirting and catching glimpses at one another, as well as knowing there\u2019s some kind of attraction to each other, they don\u2019t otherwise speak of it out loud.

How strange for his usual behavior that Y/N knows nothing of.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, uh, any plans for the summer?&rdquo; He asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, it has just ended.&rdquo; Y/N says to him and Tony almost faints. The way she says his name. So innocently, so purely and shyly. He&rsquo;s ready to give her his heart.&nbsp;&ldquo;Summer&rsquo;s next year.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Still, have any plans already?&rdquo; He repeats his question. Tony&rsquo;s realised his clumsiness but tries to make it better, still tries to keep up a conversation with the beautiful creature.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; She responds.&nbsp;&ldquo;Probably sleeping. I get very tired during the school year.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;From all the studying and working hard and late?&rdquo; Tony asks, a knowing grin on his lips.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo; Y/N confirms.&nbsp;&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; She looks at him, wicked and interested eyes looking into Tony&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A year&rsquo;s the same all around for me, hon.&rdquo; He admits sorely.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I would like to join you in sleeping some day.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N can&rsquo;t stop the playful scoff, although full of shock, that leaves her mouth. She feels it&rsquo;s impolite to Tony - if he was either way horribly joking or trying to flirt. But he enjoys it, hearing and seeing her laugh. But he was serious.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Show me around first, then we&rsquo;ll talk of possible, uh, sleeping.&rdquo; Y/N says to him, patting Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. That&rsquo;s strange, he&rsquo;s never had someone playing with him like that. Everyone is always serious and modest towards him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strongly take that as permission.&rdquo; Tony tells her. She only laughs quietly, more to herself than Tony. And she shakes her head. He&rsquo;s unbelievably sure of himself.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Even though they are faintly flirting and catching glimpses at one another, as well as knowing there&rsquo;s some kind of attraction to each other, they don&rsquo;t otherwise speak of it out loud. That would be a crime! They&rsquo;ve only known each other for two or three minutes, not known, but met.&nbsp;</p><p>But they know, they knew from that moment, that they were undeniably and absolutely smitten by each other.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>Permanent taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Fn1LMWSi3hPIi-pM2VvIw\">@v0idbella</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myp6-ebXFSnmbRvVG_6ajxQ\">@inlovewithmiddleagedcelebs</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCLflR0WHRxVP1doqzxz4tg\">@works-of-fanfiction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfRqkkjEf4Lhj1SZ9DYxX8g\">@destiel-stucky4ever-loki-queen</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3ZgO8FG57WFSAS3R9LwHrg\">@stfxlou</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn0M4sV4CXbsKTQVveteEKA\">@ur-gunna-h8-ths</a> @one-taylor-one-vision <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZwG5bvLx8te_rqYc8wfzyg\">@empressdreams</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcAcaezGltNzSf8yY_zi9RA\">@betweenloveandfire</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrF7w10ZYMQgWgvDafwNabg\">@but-legendsneverdie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZdrAeErT2q1WGEqKcdUBWg\">@deardeacy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRq-Z7vA_xbE6JaKhFvoI9w\">@mavieesttriste16</a> @fvckyeahbenhardy <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllQCAkmLv_V_veFFXcZPiA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mllQCAkmLv_V_veFFXcZPiA\">@thewinchesterchronicles</a></b></i><br /></p><p><i>A/N: Forgive the ending, it sounds like a corny teen movie&rsquo;s beginning narration.

        "body": "<p>\u201cNat! Hey, Nat, we&rsquo;re gonna be late. Get a move on.\u201d Tony said as he walked into the dance studio.</p><p>Natasha finished a graceful Grande Jet\u00e9 before she turned to Tony and scowled lightly. The sun through the floor to ceiling windows caught in her red, red hair, giving the illusion that it was on fire. </p><p>\u201cTony, you know as well as I do that it is impossible for us to be &lsquo;late&rsquo; for anything. Time is relative here.\u201d</p><p>Tony shrugged. \u201cSo sue me. I like to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Now c'mon. Morgan&rsquo;s dance recital starts in 15 minutes and I don&rsquo;t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>Natasha huffed out a sigh before grabbing a towel and stalking off. Tony ambled up from the dance studio and into the living room of the Malibu mansion. Apart from the new dance studio, created just for Natasha in this version of reality, it was as if Tony had stepped back in time. The California air was soft and warm, the sound of the waves soothing and the happy cry of birds drifted in through the open patio doors. </p><p>\u201cHey J., what&rsquo;s on the agenda for tomorrow?\u201d he inquired casually.</p><p>\u201cThe Barton&rsquo;s are having a cookout on their farm in Iowa to celebrate Master Nathan&rsquo;s birthday. I believe that several of the Avengers plan to attend. Master Harley doesn&rsquo;t know it yet, but he will make a last minute decision to attend a fraternity party at MIT tomorrow evening. I think it best if you tag along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, I think you are right, Jarvis. That terror always manages to find trouble. This Guardian Angel gig is harder than I thought it would be.\u201d Tony mused. \u201cBetween Peter, Morgan and Harley, my time in the workshop is getting harder and harder to come by. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on Nebula!\u201d he groused good naturedly. At that moment, Natasha strolled in. Dressed smartly in an elegant summer dress, she was radiant, youthful and beautiful. Tony smiled. One thing about the afterlife that he was really enjoying was the lack of aches and pains from age and hard living. He felt and looked in peak physical condition and so did Natasha.

With a startled gasp the little girl and the young man witnessed a brilliant red and yellow Painted Lady butterfly settle itself gently onto the arm of the little ballerina.
