Looking as the castle got closer and closer. The screeching of seagulls an evident sign that you were near land. This was the home of the Targaryens. All before your family killed them. All before only two made it out. And now, twenty two years later Daenerys was back. To the very place she was born but hadn\u2019t been old enough to remember.</p><p>When you were all on the beach you could feel the wet sand caving in ever so slightly with every step you took. You lifted up your skirt and helped Lucia out of the boat looking up at the castle.</p><p>\u201cMama, its a castle.\u201d She said quietly as Varys who had rejoined you all before you left for Dragon Stone held the crate that Ser Robb was in. Lucia had a tight grip on her wooden sword as you all followed Daenerys through the beach. Lucia dragging her sword along with her.</p><p>You climbed steps that lead to a stone pathway to the castle. Lucia had gone from wearing ratty clothing to nicer clothes that Daenerys had made for her. A nice dark dress with gold threading and embroidery is what she had decided to wear. Holding onto Lucia\u2019s hand you cautiously followed the pathway.</p><p>You all turned a corner to see a large gate. Two stone statues of dragon heads on either side of the gate, stairs leading up to the gate.</p><p>If there was one thing the Targaryens were better at than the Lannisters, it was being dramatic about their architecture. </p><p>Two of The Unsullied walked to the gate and pushed it open for you all to walk through. This was the most extravagant castle you\u2019d ever seen. From the outside at least. The Red Keep was impressive. But it was personalized for a certain house like this was.</p><p> You could see the zig zagging pathway that was built into the hill. The green grass and rocks of the hill reflecting the sun giving it a brighter look.</p><p>The throne room was the best part. \u00a0The large doors to it already being cracked open with a dragon shaped handle bar. Looking up you saw Stannis\u2019 banners. The stag in there center of a flaming heart. So many people you knew&hellip; Gone. All because of your family or something your family had done.</p><p>Daenerys walked up to one of the dusty moth eaten banners and pulled it down. The ceiling was the highest thing you\u2019d ever seen. The stone cold and polished like the stone in The Red Keep. There was a throne in the back center of the room, a window behind it. The drone seemingly carved out of stone itself. </p><p>You felt Lucia\u2019s grip on your hand tighten. You were all looking at the room. It was intimating. Whoever sat upon that throne would\u2019ve scared you. It made you feel like a certain pressure was being put upon you when you stepped in, your shoes making you steps more audible.</p><p>You didn\u2019t like it. It felt like something sinister would happen here.</p><p>A red priestess. The woman who fed lies to the man you were raised to believe was your uncle.</p><p>\u201cI believe you have a role to play. As does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>You could feel your heart drop. You hadn\u2019t heard his name come from someone else\u2019s lips in years. Jon Snow. \u2018The Bastard of Winterfell&rsquo; who fathered \u2018The Bastard of The Red Keep\u2019</p><p>\u201cJon Snow?\u201d You and Tyrion asked in unison. Lucia\u2019s hand was in yours as she stared at the woman who she didn\u2019t know curiously. More than likely curious as to why she was wearing all red.</p><p>\u201cNed Stark\u2019s Bastard?\u201d Tyrion asked</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Daenerys asked turning to the two of you.</p><p>\u201cI travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d Tyrion said</p><p>\u201cI-I\u201d You weren\u2019t able to collect words. The only two here who knew of Lucia\u2019s true parentage was Tyrion and Varys. Everyone else here thought Loras was her father.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the mother of his child. Lucia is a northerner by blood.\u201d Tyrion finished for you. The red priestess who\u2019s name you hadn\u2019t quite got looked at you shocked. She heard Sansa mention Jon\u2019s child. But now she knew. Now she\u2019s seen the child in person. A short little girl with bouncing black curls atop her head which cascaded down to her shoulders. Pale skin much like his own and the dark brooding eyes much like his own.</p><p>Daenerys gave you a look. You didn\u2019t know what the look was but you didn\u2019t like it. Not one bit did you appreciate that look.</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?\u201d</p><p>Varys asked</p><p>\u201cAside from visions you\u2019ve seen in the flames that is.\u201d He clarified </p><p>Wait, King in the North? He was a King?</p><p>\u201cAs Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from grave danger.\u201d</p><p>Lord Commander?</p><p>\u201cAs King in the North, he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses, so together they may face their common enemy. \u201c</p><p>You smiled to yourself at the thought. Of course he would. Jon Snow of Winterfell letting Wildlings past the Wall to protect them sounded like something Jon would do. </p><p>\u201cHe sounds like quite a man.\u201d Daenerys said</p><p>\u201cSummon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion stepped forward \u201cI can&rsquo;t speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow. And I trust him. I would put my niece\u2019s life in his hands. And I am an excellent judge of character. If he does rule the North, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannister executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looked from Tyrion to the Red Priestess then to you and Lucia who was looking at everyone curiously. </p><p>\u201cVery well. Y/N send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his queen invites him to come to Dragonstone&hellip;and bend the knee.\u201d</p><p>You had sat down by the candlelight after Lucia had gone to bed. The white cat asleep by the foot of the bed. </p><p>You held the pen and ink that came in the stationary kit Varys had given you. You didn\u2019t know what to say to him. What could you say? You hadn\u2019t talked to him in what? Almost six years? Since the morning after your daughter was conceived?</p><p>But it was almost as if your hand knew. It knew everything you had wanted to write down on paper for him since the very moment you had fallen pregnant to the very moment you thought you had let go on the ship to Pentos. </p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p><i>Dear Jon, The King in the North, </i></p><p><i>Queen Daenerys Targaryen invites you to Dragonstone to create an alliance between the Starks and the Targaryens in the war to come. </i></p><p><i>I hope you come. Do you remember when the Seven Kingdoms each had a king and queen of their own? If it weren\u2019t for Aegon Targaryen Ned Stark would\u2019ve been a king. And you could\u2019ve worn a crown on your head.</i></p><p>You remembered the conversation. As he had helped tie your corset back up in the early morning of the day you left Winterfell. You wish you could go back and tell yourself not to leave that room.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s Y/N? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.\u201d </p><p>Jon knew it was you. The sloppy hand writing for someone who had been a princess. And that last bit. One of the last things you ever said to him. you had been facing the window of his chambers while he had pulled tightly on your corset, so tight he thought you would stop breathing but you didn\u2019t. </p><p>He remembered what he told you. </p><p>\u201cIf my father was a king, and legitimized me, I\u2019d make you my queen.\u201d</p><p>He remembered it because you had turned around, a sad smile on your face. Your gold hair back in the braid style it had been in. How one of your arms rested on his shoulder and the other on his bare chest when he should have been getting ready as well. You were just in an underskirt and your corset. He wanted to go back to that day and just hold you. To pull you fully into his arms again and runaway with you. You could have gone somewhere where no one would find you. Where you could have raised your daughter together.</p><p> \u201cRead the last bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when the Seven Kingdoms each had a king and queen of their own? If it weren\u2019t for Aegon Targaryen Ned Stark would\u2019ve been a king. And you could\u2019ve worn a crown on your head.\u201d</p><p>Sansa was confused by the statement that was written down \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d She asked looking at the back of her older half-brother\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the last things she said to me. The morning before we left. That last time I saw her.\u201d He said </p><p>\u201cYou know her better than any of us. You spent a few years with her. You were married to her uncle. What do you think?\u201d Jon asked turning to to look at his sister. </p><p>Sansa shook her head in thought</p><p>\u201cY/N and Tyrion are not like the other Lannisters. They were always kind to me, but this is too great a risk.\u201d</p><p>Jon gave Sansa a look. He needed to go.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p>",

You lifted up your skirt and helped Lucia out of the boat looking up at the castle.</p><p>\u201cMama, its a castle.\u201d She said quietly as Varys who had rejoined you all before you left for Dragon Stone held the crate that Ser Robb was in. Lucia had a tight grip on her wooden sword as you all followed Daenerys through the beach. Lucia dragging her sword along with her.</p><p>You climbed steps that lead to a stone pathway to the castle. Lucia had gone from wearing ratty clothing to nicer clothes that Daenerys had made for her. A nice dark dress with gold threading and embroidery is what she had decided to wear. Holding onto Lucia\u2019s hand you cautiously followed the pathway.</p><p>You all turned a corner to see a large gate. Two stone statues of dragon heads on either side of the gate, stairs leading up to the gate.</p><p>If there was one thing the Targaryens were better at than the Lannisters, it was being dramatic about their architecture. </p><p>Two of The Unsullied walked to the gate and pushed it open for you all to walk through.

The green grass and rocks of the hill reflecting the sun giving it a brighter look.</p><p>The throne room was the best part. \u00a0The large doors to it already being cracked open with a dragon shaped handle bar.

The ceiling was the highest thing you\u2019d ever seen. The stone cold and polished like the stone in The Red Keep. There was a throne in the back center of the room, a window behind it. The drone seemingly carved out of stone itself. </p><p>You felt Lucia\u2019s grip on your hand tighten. You were all looking at the room. It was intimating. Whoever sat upon that throne would\u2019ve scared you. It made you feel like a certain pressure was being put upon you when you stepped in, your shoes making you steps more audible.</p><p>You didn\u2019t like it. It felt like something sinister would happen here.</p><p>A red priestess. The woman who fed lies to the man you were raised to believe was your uncle.</p><p>\u201cI believe you have a role to play.

Jon Snow. \u2018The Bastard of Winterfell\u2019 who fathered \u2018The Bastard of The Red Keep\u2019</p><p>\u201cJon Snow?\u201d You and Tyrion asked in unison. Lucia\u2019s hand was in yours as she stared at the woman who she didn\u2019t know curiously. More than likely curious as to why she was wearing all red.</p><p>\u201cNed Stark\u2019s Bastard?\u201d Tyrion asked</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Daenerys asked turning to the two of you.</p><p>\u201cI travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night\u2019s Watch.\u201d Tyrion said</p><p>\u201cI-I\u201d You weren\u2019t able to collect words. The only two here who knew of Lucia\u2019s true parentage was Tyrion and Varys. Everyone else here thought Loras was her father.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the mother of his child. Lucia is a northerner by blood.\u201d Tyrion finished for you. The red priestess who\u2019s name you hadn\u2019t quite got looked at you shocked. She heard Sansa mention Jon\u2019s child. But now she knew. Now she\u2019s seen the child in person. A short little girl with bouncing black curls atop her head which cascaded down to her shoulders. Pale skin much like his own and the dark brooding eyes much like his own.</p><p>Daenerys gave you a look. You didn\u2019t know what the look was but you didn\u2019t like it. Not one bit did you appreciate that look.</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?\u201d</p><p>Varys asked</p><p>\u201cAside from visions you\u2019ve seen in the flames that is.\u201d He clarified </p><p>Wait, King in the North? He was a King?</p><p>\u201cAs Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch, he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from grave danger.\u201d</p><p>Lord Commander?</p><p>\u201cAs King in the North, he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses, so together they may face their common enemy. \u201c</p><p>You smiled to yourself at the thought. Of course he would. Jon Snow of Winterfell letting Wildlings past the Wall to protect them sounded like something Jon would do. </p><p>\u201cHe sounds like quite a man.\u201d Daenerys said</p><p>\u201cSummon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion stepped forward \u201cI can\u2019t speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow. And I trust him. I would put my niece\u2019s life in his hands. And I am an excellent judge of character. If he does rule the North, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannister executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looked from Tyrion to the Red Priestess then to you and Lucia who was looking at everyone curiously. </p><p>\u201cVery well. Y/N send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his queen invites him to come to Dragonstone\u2026and bend the knee.\u201d</p><p>You had sat down by the candlelight after Lucia had gone to bed. The white cat asleep by the foot of the bed. </p><p>You held the pen and ink that came in the stationary kit Varys had given you. You didn\u2019t know what to say to him. What could you say? You hadn\u2019t talked to him in what? Almost six years? Since the morning after your daughter was conceived?</p><p>But it was almost as if your hand knew. It knew everything you had wanted to write down on paper for him since the very moment you had fallen pregnant to the very moment you thought you had let go on the ship to Pentos. </p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p><i>Dear Jon, The King in the North, </i></p><p><i>Queen Daenerys Targaryen invites you to Dragonstone to create an alliance between the Starks and the Targaryens in the war to come. </i></p><p><i>I hope you come.

You wish you could go back and tell yourself not to leave that room.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s Y/N? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.\u201d </p><p>Jon knew it was you. The sloppy hand writing for someone who had been a princess. And that last bit. One of the last things you ever said to him. you had been facing the window of his chambers while he had pulled tightly on your corset, so tight he thought you would stop breathing but you didn\u2019t. </p><p>He remembered what he told you. </p><p>\u201cIf my father was a king, and legitimized me, I\u2019d make you my queen.\u201d</p><p>He remembered it because you had turned around, a sad smile on your face. Your gold hair back in the braid style it had been in. How one of your arms rested on his shoulder and the other on his bare chest when he should have been getting ready as well. You were just in an underskirt and your corset. He wanted to go back to that day and just hold you. To pull you fully into his arms again and runaway with you. You could have gone somewhere where no one would find you. Where you could have raised your daughter together.</p><p> \u201cRead the last bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when the Seven Kingdoms each had a king and queen of their own? If it weren\u2019t for Aegon Targaryen Ned Stark would\u2019ve been a king. And you could\u2019ve worn a crown on your head.\u201d</p><p>Sansa was confused by the statement that was written down \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d She asked looking at the back of her older half-brother\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the last things she said to me. The morning before we left. That last time I saw her.\u201d He said </p><p>\u201cYou know her better than any of us. You spent a few years with her. You were married to her uncle. What do you think?\u201d Jon asked turning to to look at his sister. </p><p>Sansa shook her head in thought</p><p>\u201cY/N and Tyrion are not like the other Lannisters. They were always kind to me, but this is too great a risk.\u201d</p><p>Jon gave Sansa a look. He needed to go.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p></p>",

Looking as the castle got closer and closer. The screeching of seagulls an evident sign that you were near land. This was the home of the Targaryens. All before your family killed them. All before only two made it out. And now, twenty two years later Daenerys was back. To the very place she was born but hadn&rsquo;t been old enough to remember.</p><p>When you were all on the beach you could feel the wet sand caving in ever so slightly with every step you took. You lifted up your skirt and helped Lucia out of the boat looking up at the castle.</p><p>&ldquo;Mama, its a castle.&rdquo; She said quietly as Varys who had rejoined you all before you left for Dragon Stone held the crate that Ser Robb was in. Lucia had a tight grip on her wooden sword as you all followed Daenerys through the beach. Lucia dragging her sword along with her.</p><p>You climbed steps that lead to a stone pathway to the castle. Lucia had gone from wearing ratty clothing to nicer clothes that Daenerys had made for her. A nice dark dress with gold threading and embroidery is what she had decided to wear. Holding onto Lucia&rsquo;s hand you cautiously followed the pathway.</p><p>You all turned a corner to see a large gate. Two stone statues of dragon heads on either side of the gate, stairs leading up to the gate.</p><p>If there was one thing the Targaryens were better at than the Lannisters, it was being dramatic about their architecture. </p><p>Two of The Unsullied walked to the gate and pushed it open for you all to walk through. This was the most extravagant castle you&rsquo;d ever seen. From the outside at least. The Red Keep was impressive. But it was personalized for a certain house like this was.</p><p> You could see the zig zagging pathway that was built into the hill. The green grass and rocks of the hill reflecting the sun giving it a brighter look.</p><p>The throne room was the best part. &nbsp;The large doors to it already being cracked open with a dragon shaped handle bar. Looking up you saw Stannis&rsquo; banners. The stag in there center of a flaming heart. So many people you knew&hellip; Gone. All because of your family or something your family had done.</p><p>Daenerys walked up to one of the dusty moth eaten banners and pulled it down. The ceiling was the highest thing you&rsquo;d ever seen. The stone cold and polished like the stone in The Red Keep. There was a throne in the back center of the room, a window behind it. The drone seemingly carved out of stone itself. </p><p>You felt Lucia&rsquo;s grip on your hand tighten. You were all looking at the room. It was intimating. Whoever sat upon that throne would&rsquo;ve scared you. It made you feel like a certain pressure was being put upon you when you stepped in, your shoes making you steps more audible.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t like it. It felt like something sinister would happen here.</p><p>A red priestess. The woman who fed lies to the man you were raised to believe was your uncle.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe you have a role to play. As does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel your heart drop. You hadn&rsquo;t heard his name come from someone else&rsquo;s lips in years. Jon Snow. &lsquo;The Bastard of Winterfell&rsquo; who fathered &lsquo;The Bastard of The Red Keep&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon Snow?&rdquo; You and Tyrion asked in unison. Lucia&rsquo;s hand was in yours as she stared at the woman who she didn&rsquo;t know curiously. More than likely curious as to why she was wearing all red.</p><p>&ldquo;Ned Stark&rsquo;s Bastard?&rdquo; Tyrion asked</p><p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; Daenerys asked turning to the two of you.</p><p>&ldquo;I travelled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night&rsquo;s Watch.&rdquo; Tyrion said</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rdquo; You weren&rsquo;t able to collect words. The only two here who knew of Lucia&rsquo;s true parentage was Tyrion and Varys. Everyone else here thought Loras was her father.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the mother of his child. Lucia is a northerner by blood.&rdquo; Tyrion finished for you. The red priestess who&rsquo;s name you hadn&rsquo;t quite got looked at you shocked. She heard Sansa mention Jon&rsquo;s child. But now she knew. Now she&rsquo;s seen the child in person. A short little girl with bouncing black curls atop her head which cascaded down to her shoulders. Pale skin much like his own and the dark brooding eyes much like his own.</p><p>Daenerys gave you a look. You didn&rsquo;t know what the look was but you didn&rsquo;t like it. Not one bit did you appreciate that look.</p><p>&ldquo;And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?&rdquo;</p><p>Varys asked</p><p>&ldquo;Aside from visions you&rsquo;ve seen in the flames that is.&rdquo; He clarified </p><p>Wait, King in the North? He was a King?</p><p>&ldquo;As Lord Commander of the Night&rsquo;s Watch, he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from grave danger.&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Commander?</p><p>&ldquo;As King in the North, he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses, so together they may face their common enemy. &ldquo;</p><p>You smiled to yourself at the thought. Of course he would. Jon Snow of Winterfell letting Wildlings past the Wall to protect them sounded like something Jon would do. </p><p>&ldquo;He sounds like quite a man.&rdquo; Daenerys said</p><p>&ldquo;Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion stepped forward &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow. And I trust him. I would put my niece&rsquo;s life in his hands. And I am an excellent judge of character. If he does rule the North, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannister executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys looked from Tyrion to the Red Priestess then to you and Lucia who was looking at everyone curiously. </p><p>&ldquo;Very well. Y/N send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his queen invites him to come to Dragonstone&hellip;and bend the knee.&rdquo;</p><p>You had sat down by the candlelight after Lucia had gone to bed. The white cat asleep by the foot of the bed. </p><p>You held the pen and ink that came in the stationary kit Varys had given you. You didn&rsquo;t know what to say to him. What could you say? You hadn&rsquo;t talked to him in what? Almost six years? Since the morning after your daughter was conceived?</p><p>But it was almost as if your hand knew. It knew everything you had wanted to write down on paper for him since the very moment you had fallen pregnant to the very moment you thought you had let go on the ship to Pentos. </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p><i>Dear Jon, The King in the North, </i></p><p><i>Queen Daenerys Targaryen invites you to Dragonstone to create an alliance between the Starks and the Targaryens in the war to come. </i></p><p><i>I hope you come.

It will be very interesting and smart step from Jon Snow. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2aa6d62f5d0a0f6b6bbd712f8fc2dac/tumblr_pmb0fitr8a1vzef6y_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",

And Jon works at the farm that belongs to him with Theon and there were cows)) Dany is an attorney or a lawyer something like that. There is also Sansa and Jaime starting a relationships and Sansa moves in with Dany. And there is an unplanned Jonerys pregnancy although. That\u2019s all I can remember. The fic was absolutely stunning and I\u2019ve been reading it non stop but then I just fucking lost it somehow. I don\u2019t know how. Please if anyone has any idea which one is it please tell me! I\u2019ve been dying to find out what happens next! I was reading it on AO3 but I cannot find it in my history there.

It\u2019s what he\u2019s best at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s letting them keep slaves for another seven years.\u201d Missandei said with a certain venom in her voice. She never did seem like the type to be angry often. </p><p>You nodded and looked to the bed. Lucia asleep, with the covers pulled around her small body. She was much smaller than a normal three year old should be. She was still just a kid though. Who seemed to be more and more shy everyday. So much too to the point she only talked to you, Varys and Tyrion. Even though she seemed very curious with Missandei and Grey Worm.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m happy about this? Every time I think of a woman forced to be in a whorehouse. I think of the children born to those women who were ripped from their arms and sold like cattle. I think of my own daughter. What if I had never been born a Lannister? And her father had just been passing through a slave city and spent a night in a brothel with me? And nine months later she had been born? The moment I had her crying in my arms I didn\u2019t want to let go. I couldn\u2019t imagine someone ripping her out of my arms before I even had the chance to name her.\u201d</p><p>Missandei\u2019s face softened as she looked over to the sleeping child who\u2019s hair surrounded her shoulders and face. Her long eyelashes brushing against her cheeks like her father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI could never imagine her with chains.\u201d Missandei said.</p><p>You could never imagine her in chains either. Such a small girl with barely any muscle. Tyrion had suggested that you begin to teach her how to sword fight. He said that it would help her build muscle that she needed to gain and that a lot of little boys bagan to learn when they turned four. That Jaime had started to learn at 4 and a half.</p><p>You had begun to think about it. It never hurt to teach her early. You could get a wooden sparing sword fit for her size, you could start teaching her how to avoid certain situation if they ever arose. You had made a promise to yourself and to her the day she was born. You made a promise to protect her. And you wouldn\u2019t be there for her all the time even if you wanted to be. She would one day be on her own, and if a man decided to put their hands on her you wanted to be sure she knew how to defend herself</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\u201cSince our pact with the masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?\u201d</p><p>Lucia fidgeted in your arms as she tried to rest her head. You had begun to teach her the basics. How to hold a sword. She struggled with it and was overly exhausted by having to hold it in her hands. You had been taught when you were seven and onwards. Most people from less powerful houses started learning then. But the only reason you had started then was because you were a girl.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Grey Worm answered</p><p>\u201cAnd how many Masters have been killed by the free men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo, but that was the day of the pact.\u201d</p><p>Varys and Tyrion had made a deal with the masters. Allowed to keep work the slaves out by the end of a seven year mark. You knew seven years could make a big difference in someone\u2019s life. A fortnight had made a big deal to you. </p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s safe to say a fragile peace had taken hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d You replied as Lucia whined lowly as her dark eyes fluttered shut as she finally found a position in your arms to get comfortable in. </p><p>\u201cFor now is the best we get in our profession.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion was walking back and forth, a sort of pacing with a cup of wine in his hand while he did it. Its what he was good at, drinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d Tyrion said as he kept pacing </p><p>\u201cConsidering the city was on the brink of civil war, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just for Meereen to have peace.\u201d You said quietly </p><p>\u201cThey need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t responsible for a peace meeting she wasn\u2019t here for.\u201d</p><p>Very quickly you were beginning to see that what Daenerys had taken as her\u2019s was crumbling. She had taken it and as a naive child she thought it would hold under her reign. She was a whole year older than you and you could see the errors in her ways of taking control. She believed everything could become a normal for the citizens. </p><p>\u201cThe Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.\u201d</p><p>The Unburnt. </p><p>You looked down at Lucia carefully. A child who just like the queen could touch a flame and be unharmed. Who could hold hot wax and not a mark be on her. You didn\u2019t know how. You didn\u2019t know if you wanted to know. You just knew that you probably shouldn\u2019t tell anyone.</p><p>\u201cThe people know who brought them freedom.\u201d Missandei said</p><p>\u201cYes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust. Someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.\u201d</p><p>You held Lucia\u2019s head as she began moving again to get comfortable. Never quite finding the perfect position to fall asleep in.</p><p>\u201cSounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about \u2018him?\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\u201cSo? This farewell?\u201d</p><p>Varys nodded as he held a cloth bag in his hands. He was leaving for Westeros. The queen needed allies in the west if she was to take the Iron Throne. She would need as many allies as she could gather to help her fight. People who hated the Lannisters. You just hoped that Tyrion, Lucia and your own safety would be secured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I do have something for you however.\u201d </p><p>One of your brows went up while the other went down in curiosity. Something that had developed in the muscles in your face. He reached into the bag and took out a small box and handed it to you. </p><p>It was a deep red colored wood, from an old tree no doubt. It had hinges on it, meant to be a storage box for whatever was in it. You grabbed the lip of the lid and lifted it. No squeaking. Thank the gods. When you opened it you came face to face with a stationary set. Loads of slim long papers you could turn into a raven scroll and normal sheets of paper you could use for a hand delivered letter. There was a pen and ink in the box as well. There where sticks of yellow wax and a stamp seal. Carefully you held the box in your left hand and picked up the stamp seal with the other to look at what it had. It was a fairly large stamp seal. Looking at it, it had a lion in the middle, with a stag to the right of it and a rose to left.</p><p>You smiled and looked at Varys. This was perfect. You\u2019d never had a stationary set before nor had you ever had your own stamp seal with a personalized sigil on it. </p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you for everything you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d You said with a grateful smile.</p><p>He nodded and then looked to Lucia who was playing with the doll Loras had given her for her first name day.</p><p>\u201cI also have something for you little lion.\u201d</p><p>You could feel chills going up your back as you heard that phrase. He walked over to her held a hand out for her to take. \u201cI have a gift for you. What do you say we go and get it?\u201d</p><p>You smiled as Varys left the room with Lucia who had happily without a word followed him out. You placed the box on the table of your room and smiled. You already knew who your first letter would be to.</p><p>No even a moment later Lucia came back in with a big smile holding something that was a pure white in her arms. Turning your head to see what it was, you saw a small cat in her arms who seemed to have settled in.</p><p>\u201cMama! Look! It\u2019s a baby lion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a kitten, Luci. Was this Varys\u2019s gift to you?\u201d You asked kneeling down next to her to look at the long hair cat.</p><p>She nodded happily and held the small animal to her. \u201cWhat do I name him?\u201d</p><p>You looked at the small thing curiously and smiled as you came to a realization. \u201cRobb. Let\u2019s name him Ser Robb. Like your uncle Tommen named his cat Ser Pounce.\u201d</p><p>Robb was one of her other uncles. Not that she had ever met him. She could only really remember Tommen if she was lucky.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to our queen!\u201d</p><p>You held your wine glass higher than Missandei and Greyworm were and Lucia seemed more distracted by dangling the ribbon she had taken out of her hair above Ser Robb.</p><p>\u201cAnyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.\u201d Tyrion said in a desperate attempt to get Grey Worm and Missandei to drink the red liquid in their cups.</p><p>Grey Worm and Missandei slowly raised their cups up for whatever toast your uncle would give to the missing queen.</p><p>\u201cTo Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, Long may she reign.\u201d</p><p>All of you including little Lucia repeated his last words. \u201cLong may she reign.\u201d You quickly drank the entire glass of wine and placed it down on the table while Grey Worm and Missandei took careful sips.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Tyrion asked the two</p><p>\u201cTastes like it has turned.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded as he walked around Lucia and to the canister of wine and filled his cup up once again. To think you used to chastise him for drinking to much. To think you threw a full canister of wine over a parapet for arranging Trystane and Myrcella\u2019s wedding. </p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms&hellip; I\u2019d like to have my vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp\u2019s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at the thought. You could practically see Tyrion at Casterly Rock with a Vineyard in the gardens. Making wine and sending it in crates to people he knew well enough to trust with what wine he had made.</p><p>\u201cTell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion had made his way back over to where you were all sitting as \u00a0Lucia had picked up her kitten and sat down next to you once more. The white ball of fluff sitting in her lap tired out after it\u2019s jumping to try and get the red ribbon that Lucia had now tied around his neck in a bow.</p><p>\u201cI do not know any jokes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked a bit put out by this as his attention then went to the commander of The Unsullied</p><p>\u201cGrey Worm.\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet as he looked at your uncle with a blank face.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head \u201cI don\u2019t have any good jokes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sighed as he filled his cup up more and eyes the small kitten in your daughter\u2019s lap as he took a sip from his glass.</p><p>\u201cThree lords walk into a tavern\u2014A Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven hells.\u201d You murmured to yourself. Missandei and Grey Worm would never understand this joke. They weren\u2019t from Westeros. They didn\u2019t understand the inner workings of the houses and how they worked with or against each other.</p><p>\u201cThey order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outrages, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, \u201cSpit it out you wee shit. Spit it out!\u201d</p><p>Both Grey Worm and Missandei remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhich lords of those three houses? Which Stark? The one beheaded who\u2019s head was put on a spike? The ones who were killed by the Areys Targaryen? Or the one who was beheaded and who\u2019s direwolf\u2019s head was sewn onto his own neck? Which Martell? Oberyn? Who died for you? For his sister, niece and nephew? To try and get vengeance? Or his brother? King of Dorne? Who was stabbed by Ellaria Sand?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t mean for it to come out. It just did. Your family had seen so many family houses die out in the past thirty years. First the Reynes of Castamere. Then the Targaryens, then the Baratheons, almost all of House Stark and then all of House Martell.</p><p>Tyrion remained quiet as he looked at you. He knew you had a special bond with Ned Stark. Something that had happened very quickly after one of Jaime\u2019s men stabbed Ned in the back of the leg. Right around the time you had been begun to get farther along in your pregnancy with Lucia.</p><p>\u201cThe Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t before.\u201d You said bitterly</p><p>Tyrion cringed at the tense air in the room and looked at Missandei \u201cLet\u2019s lighten the mood, tell a joke!\u201d He insisted again.</p><p>Missandei nodded hesitantly \u201cTwo translators are on a sinking ship, and one asks the other \u201cCan you swim?\u201d And the other says \u201cNow but I can shout for help in nineteen languages.\u201d </p><p>You remained quiet as did Grey Worm, while Tyrion forced an awkward laugh</p><p>\u201cThat was the worst joke I ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what a joke is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am solider. You think I never hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lied to us?\u201d Tyrion asked playfully.</p><p>\u201cI make joke.\u201d He said plainly which brought a small smile to your face while Missandei laughed and Tyrion let out a soft Chuckle while Lucia pet her cat quietly.</p><p>\u201cMore jokes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The Madam says\u2014\u201c</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s joke was interrupted by bells ringing outside the pyrimid. You stood placing a hand on Lucia\u2019s shoulder while both Missandi and Grey Worm stood as well.</p><p>You followed after Grey Worm as he ran to the door of the room. You grabbed your sword off of one of the tables you had placed it on.</p><p>The masters had come for their property.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>You could do nothing but put Lucia in a cupboard with Ser Robb and a toy or two with a blanket and a pillow to keep her arm. The sound of shouting from outside and the sound of catapults launching whatever they had loaded was a clear sound you thought you\u2019d never hear again.</p><p>You were wrong.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. I admit it.\u201d Tyrion said entering the room with Missandei while you stood next to Grey Worm</p><p>\u201cThat changes nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers\u2019 forces\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.\u201d Grey Worm interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have acknowledged that I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyrion! Your talking has gotten you into some bad situations, but now you\u2019ve got an entire city in danger! Your little outburst at your trial is the reason you&rsquo;re here! You could have gone to the night\u2019s watch instead if you had kept your mouth shut! You\u2019re trying to tell us what the army should do! You don\u2019t know what the army should do!\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sighed slightly at you yelling at him. No one could ever calm you down when you were angry like you were now. Only Jaime and Cersei had been able to when you were little and easier to pick up and put in a corner.</p><p>\u201cAll right, what should the army do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go to the beach.\u201d You said carefully. \u201cIf we go to the beach, the masters will see their chance to take the Pyramid. Whoever has the Pyramid had Meereen. We stay here. We defend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait for them to come to us. Then we fight.\u201d</p><p>A sudden sound of a crash from outside against the pyramid walls made you look up at the ceiling. That wasn\u2019t what was in a catapult.</p><p>You looked to Grey Worm and he nodded. Grabbing your sword you strapped it to your waist and followed Grey Worm, the others following the two of you as well.</p><p>You got into a defensive position. Some unsullied going to the door, spears up while you unsheathed your sword and held it up ready to hit whoever was right outside.</p><p>Grey Worm took out a small knife and held it defensively as well. Ready for a fight. Very carefully an unsullied open the door and one walked through very carefully with their shield up while the rest of you stayed.</p><p>Suddenly the unsullied got on one knee. Your brows furrowed tightly before Daenerys walked trough the door.</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>You all stood. In a straight line across from the three masters. Who represented the slave cities that were trying to take Meereen.</p><p>\u201cOnce before I had offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver\u2019s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.\u201d</p><p>You looked out to the water. Ships upon ships of all sizes flinging giant balls of fire at the city which had been freed over two years ago.</p><p>\u201cWe are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.\u201d Tyrion said flatly with a straight strong posture as he stood in front of the masters.</p><p>\u201cThe terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys Mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys Mo Naklos will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>Your brows rose up as you looked at the three men. They honestly believed Daenerys would be the one surrendering today?</p><p>\u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t communicate clearly. We\u2019re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.\u201d She clarified looking at the men.</p><p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s difficult adjusting to the new reality. Your reign in over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reign has just begun.\u201d</p><p>A small smirk spread across your face as a dragon\u2019s screech ripped through the air. The masters turned but before they could her third dragon flew above you all. The one you had seen flying over old Valyria. The one who had flew Daenerys out of the arena. The dragon then landed on the old watch tower above you all. </p><p>You looked up at the dragon as he screeched even louder before jumping down next to Daenerys, his head coming up next to her own.</p><p>You watched as the queen climbed onto the back of her dragon and flew off of the cliff with him knocking over the master\u2019s soldiers.</p><p>You watched. You watched with a smirk as the other two dragons broke free from their dungeon beneath the pyramid and flew to the ships as well. And an almost satisfied smirk as they set the ships on tire.</p><p>Grey Worm stepped forward and spoke to the master\u2019s soldiers in Valyrian. The men placed down their weapons and ran down the hill to the main ground.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now last time we spoke. We made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.\u201d Missandei said</p><p>\u201cIt always seems a bit abstract, doesn\u2019t it, other people dying?\u201d</p><p>One of the masters pushed forward another </p><p>\u201cHim! He should die\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes him!\u201d The other piped in in a worried manner.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not one of us. He\u2019s an outsider, lowborn! He does not speak for us.\u201d </p><p>Grey Worm and you both walked forward. His hands behind his back while one of your hands rested on the hilt of your sword and the other rested at your side. You both came up to the man they had been pushing forward.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The man pleaded dropping to his knees \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>You pulled out the dagger from your waist and cut through one of the master\u2019s throats while Grey Worm cut through the other\u2019s. Leaving the one in the middle.</p><p>You and Grey Worm both stepped back without a word while you straightened out the skirt of your dress and fixed the sleeves as well.</p><p>Tyrion stepped forward and placed a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder</p><p>\u201cTell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind them what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>You never wanted to see his face again. The little rat who betrayed the Starks for his own glory. Just to prove himself to a father he hadn\u2019t seen in years. Not since he was just a child. </p><p>\u201cLast time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height I seem to recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I saw him, was in dream of me slitting cutting his head off and sewing an octopuses head on his neck.\u201d You said bitterly holding onto Lucia\u2019s hand tightly. </p><p>\u201cYes, I heard you telling Varys that on the ship to Pentos. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf\u2019s height thinks he\u2019s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf\u2019s height.\u201d</p><p>Yara and Theon fucking Greyjoy. In front of your very eyes. The moment you had heard of Theon betraying Robb you wanted to kill him. You wanted to kill him four almost five years ago as well when he had made Jon so upset he had come into your quarters angry. You had let Jon rant until someone his head was in your lap and you were singing.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The height of nobility\u2019 \u2018A man of your stature,\u2019 \u2018someone to look up to.\u2019 You\u2019re all making the same five or six jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas making Jon Snow so angry he came to me almost in tears of rage because of you a \u2018long time ago\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Theon looked to you. He didn\u2019t seem to really recognize you. But then he did. He looked from you to the little girl who\u2019s hand you had a strong grasp on held her doll in her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Tyrion confirmed \u201cAnd how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can\u2019t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t murder them.\u201d You said harshly. \u201cHe may have wanted to but he never would have. But he did things just as bad I gather. Maybe worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he paid for them.\u201d Yara interjected </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it. He\u2019s still alive. It was complicated for you, I\u2019m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were.\u201d Tyrion breathed looking over the young man in front of you. \u201cBut then, we all live complicated lives, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought us a hundred ships form the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my claim. Hers.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looks at Theon questionably, her legs crossed and in what looked to be an awkward position \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fit to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we can agree on that.\u201d You spat with venom laced in your voice so heavily you almost sounded like Joffrey or your mother.</p><p>\u201cHas the Iron islands ever had a queen before? No more than Westeros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Thron from Yara. He would have murdered us if we\u2019d stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pity that would have been.\u201d You sneered.</p><p>\u201cBe nice.\u201d Tyrion warned</p><p>\u201cHave I stabbed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m being nice.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys and Tyrion looked at you concerned while Yara gave you a look and Theon just eyes the dark haired little girl who\u2019s head was against your hip while she swayed her body in a childlike fashion.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion tell me your father was a terrible king. You and I have that in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d Daenerys said with a little bit of irritation in her voice. \u201cAnd both murdered by a usurper as well. Will their ships be enough?\u201d Daenerys asked turning her head to look at Tyrion.</p><p>\u201cWith the former Masters\u2019 fleet, possibly. Barley. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.\u201d</p><p>Theon nodded \u201cThere are and Euron is building more. He\u2019s going to offer them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why shouldn\u2019t I wait for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Iron Fleet isn\u2019t all he\u2019s bringing. He also wants to give you\u2014 \u201c</p><p>\u201cHis big cock, I think he said.\u201d Yara finished for Theon.</p><p>You found it slightly amusing how some men could hype up something that they know isn\u2019t there. It could be there, but they hype it up so much that what they say you know isn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cEuron\u2019s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You don\u2019t get one without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?\u201d Daenerys questioned</p><p>\u201cI never demand, but I\u2019m up for anything, really.\u201d Yara said with a small teasing smile.</p><p>\u201cHe murdered out father and would have murdered us. He\u2019ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Seven Kingdoms.\u201d Tyrion said more like a statement than a question.</p><p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d Theon confirmed</p><p>You reached down grabbing under Lucia\u2019s arms and picked her up resting her against your hip. You hand resting on her bottom to keep her from slipping down.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want the seven kingdoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you give them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don\u2019t think a woman\u2019s fit to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasonable.\u201d</p><hr><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> @<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingsholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>\u00a0 @<a href=\"https://veggidinosaurnuggets.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">veggiedinosaurnuggets</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> @<a href=\"http://emilielskov.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">emilieskov</a> @kayylluhh <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p>",

So much too to the point she only talked to you, Varys and Tyrion. Even though she seemed very curious with Missandei and Grey Worm.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m happy about this? Every time I think of a woman forced to be in a whorehouse. I think of the children born to those women who were ripped from their arms and sold like cattle. I think of my own daughter. What if I had never been born a Lannister? And her father had just been passing through a slave city and spent a night in a brothel with me? And nine months later she had been born? The moment I had her crying in my arms I didn\u2019t want to let go. I couldn\u2019t imagine someone ripping her out of my arms before I even had the chance to name her.\u201d</p><p>Missandei\u2019s face softened as she looked over to the sleeping child who\u2019s hair surrounded her shoulders and face. Her long eyelashes brushing against her cheeks like her father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI could never imagine her with chains.\u201d Missandei said.</p><p>You could never imagine her in chains either. Such a small girl with barely any muscle. Tyrion had suggested that you begin to teach her how to sword fight. He said that it would help her build muscle that she needed to gain and that a lot of little boys bagan to learn when they turned four. That Jaime had started to learn at 4 and a half.</p><p>You had begun to think about it. It never hurt to teach her early. You could get a wooden sparing sword fit for her size, you could start teaching her how to avoid certain situation if they ever arose. You had made a promise to yourself and to her the day she was born. You made a promise to protect her. And you wouldn\u2019t be there for her all the time even if you wanted to be. She would one day be on her own, and if a man decided to put their hands on her you wanted to be sure she knew how to defend herself</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cSince our pact with the masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?\u201d</p><p>Lucia fidgeted in your arms as she tried to rest her head. You had begun to teach her the basics. How to hold a sword. She struggled with it and was overly exhausted by having to hold it in her hands. You had been taught when you were seven and onwards. Most people from less powerful houses started learning then. But the only reason you had started then was because you were a girl.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Grey Worm answered</p><p>\u201cAnd how many Masters have been killed by the free men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo, but that was the day of the pact.\u201d</p><p>Varys and Tyrion had made a deal with the masters. Allowed to keep work the slaves out by the end of a seven year mark. You knew seven years could make a big difference in someone\u2019s life. A fortnight had made a big deal to you. </p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s safe to say a fragile peace had taken hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d You replied as Lucia whined lowly as her dark eyes fluttered shut as she finally found a position in your arms to get comfortable in. </p><p>\u201cFor now is the best we get in our profession.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion was walking back and forth, a sort of pacing with a cup of wine in his hand while he did it. Its what he was good at, drinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d Tyrion said as he kept pacing </p><p>\u201cConsidering the city was on the brink of civil war, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just for Meereen to have peace.\u201d You said quietly </p><p>\u201cThey need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t responsible for a peace meeting she wasn\u2019t here for.\u201d</p><p>Very quickly you were beginning to see that what Daenerys had taken as her\u2019s was crumbling. She had taken it and as a naive child she thought it would hold under her reign. She was a whole year older than you and you could see the errors in her ways of taking control. She believed everything could become a normal for the citizens. </p><p>\u201cThe Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.\u201d</p><p>The Unburnt. </p><p>You looked down at Lucia carefully. A child who just like the queen could touch a flame and be unharmed. Who could hold hot wax and not a mark be on her. You didn\u2019t know how. You didn\u2019t know if you wanted to know. You just knew that you probably shouldn\u2019t tell anyone.</p><p>\u201cThe people know who brought them freedom.\u201d Missandei said</p><p>\u201cYes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust. Someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.\u201d</p><p>You held Lucia\u2019s head as she began moving again to get comfortable. Never quite finding the perfect position to fall asleep in.</p><p>\u201cSounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about \u2018him?\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cSo? This farewell?\u201d</p><p>Varys nodded as he held a cloth bag in his hands. He was leaving for Westeros. The queen needed allies in the west if she was to take the Iron Throne. She would need as many allies as she could gather to help her fight. People who hated the Lannisters. You just hoped that Tyrion, Lucia and your own safety would be secured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I do have something for you however.\u201d </p><p>One of your brows went up while the other went down in curiosity. Something that had developed in the muscles in your face. He reached into the bag and took out a small box and handed it to you. </p><p>It was a deep red colored wood, from an old tree no doubt. It had hinges on it, meant to be a storage box for whatever was in it. You grabbed the lip of the lid and lifted it. No squeaking. Thank the gods. When you opened it you came face to face with a stationary set. Loads of slim long papers you could turn into a raven scroll and normal sheets of paper you could use for a hand delivered letter. There was a pen and ink in the box as well. There where sticks of yellow wax and a stamp seal. Carefully you held the box in your left hand and picked up the stamp seal with the other to look at what it had. It was a fairly large stamp seal. Looking at it, it had a lion in the middle, with a stag to the right of it and a rose to left.</p><p>You smiled and looked at Varys. This was perfect. You\u2019d never had a stationary set before nor had you ever had your own stamp seal with a personalized sigil on it. </p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you for everything you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d You said with a grateful smile.</p><p>He nodded and then looked to Lucia who was playing with the doll Loras had given her for her first name day.</p><p>\u201cI also have something for you little lion.\u201d</p><p>You could feel chills going up your back as you heard that phrase. He walked over to her held a hand out for her to take. \u201cI have a gift for you. What do you say we go and get it?\u201d</p><p>You smiled as Varys left the room with Lucia who had happily without a word followed him out. You placed the box on the table of your room and smiled. You already knew who your first letter would be to.</p><p>No even a moment later Lucia came back in with a big smile holding something that was a pure white in her arms. Turning your head to see what it was, you saw a small cat in her arms who seemed to have settled in.</p><p>\u201cMama! Look! It\u2019s a baby lion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a kitten, Luci. Was this Varys\u2019s gift to you?\u201d You asked kneeling down next to her to look at the long hair cat.</p><p>She nodded happily and held the small animal to her. \u201cWhat do I name him?\u201d</p><p>You looked at the small thing curiously and smiled as you came to a realization. \u201cRobb. Let\u2019s name him Ser Robb. Like your uncle Tommen named his cat Ser Pounce.\u201d</p><p>Robb was one of her other uncles. Not that she had ever met him. She could only really remember Tommen if she was lucky.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to our queen!\u201d</p><p>You held your wine glass higher than Missandei and Greyworm were and Lucia seemed more distracted by dangling the ribbon she had taken out of her hair above Ser Robb.</p><p>\u201cAnyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.\u201d Tyrion said in a desperate attempt to get Grey Worm and Missandei to drink the red liquid in their cups.</p><p>Grey Worm and Missandei slowly raised their cups up for whatever toast your uncle would give to the missing queen.</p><p>\u201cTo Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, Long may she reign.\u201d</p><p>All of you including little Lucia repeated his last words. \u201cLong may she reign.\u201d You quickly drank the entire glass of wine and placed it down on the table while Grey Worm and Missandei took careful sips.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Tyrion asked the two</p><p>\u201cTastes like it has turned.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded as he walked around Lucia and to the canister of wine and filled his cup up once again. To think you used to chastise him for drinking to much. To think you threw a full canister of wine over a parapet for arranging Trystane and Myrcella\u2019s wedding. </p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms\u2026 I\u2019d like to have my vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp\u2019s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at the thought. You could practically see Tyrion at Casterly Rock with a Vineyard in the gardens. Making wine and sending it in crates to people he knew well enough to trust with what wine he had made.</p><p>\u201cTell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion had made his way back over to where you were all sitting as \u00a0Lucia had picked up her kitten and sat down next to you once more. The white ball of fluff sitting in her lap tired out after it\u2019s jumping to try and get the red ribbon that Lucia had now tied around his neck in a bow.</p><p>\u201cI do not know any jokes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked a bit put out by this as his attention then went to the commander of The Unsullied</p><p>\u201cGrey Worm.\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet as he looked at your uncle with a blank face.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head \u201cI don\u2019t have any good jokes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sighed as he filled his cup up more and eyes the small kitten in your daughter\u2019s lap as he took a sip from his glass.</p><p>\u201cThree lords walk into a tavern\u2014A Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven hells.\u201d You murmured to yourself. Missandei and Grey Worm would never understand this joke. They weren\u2019t from Westeros. They didn\u2019t understand the inner workings of the houses and how they worked with or against each other.</p><p>\u201cThey order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outrages, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, \u201cSpit it out you wee shit. Spit it out!\u201d</p><p>Both Grey Worm and Missandei remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhich lords of those three houses? Which Stark? The one beheaded who\u2019s head was put on a spike? The ones who were killed by the Areys Targaryen? Or the one who was beheaded and who\u2019s direwolf\u2019s head was sewn onto his own neck? Which Martell? Oberyn? Who died for you? For his sister, niece and nephew? To try and get vengeance? Or his brother? King of Dorne? Who was stabbed by Ellaria Sand?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t mean for it to come out. It just did. Your family had seen so many family houses die out in the past thirty years. First the Reynes of Castamere. Then the Targaryens, then the Baratheons, almost all of House Stark and then all of House Martell.</p><p>Tyrion remained quiet as he looked at you. He knew you had a special bond with Ned Stark. Something that had happened very quickly after one of Jaime\u2019s men stabbed Ned in the back of the leg. Right around the time you had been begun to get farther along in your pregnancy with Lucia.</p><p>\u201cThe Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t before.\u201d You said bitterly</p><p>Tyrion cringed at the tense air in the room and looked at Missandei \u201cLet\u2019s lighten the mood, tell a joke!\u201d He insisted again.</p><p>Missandei nodded hesitantly \u201cTwo translators are on a sinking ship, and one asks the other \u201cCan you swim?\u201d And the other says \u201cNow but I can shout for help in nineteen languages.\u201d </p><p>You remained quiet as did Grey Worm, while Tyrion forced an awkward laugh</p><p>\u201cThat was the worst joke I ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what a joke is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am solider. You think I never hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lied to us?\u201d Tyrion asked playfully.</p><p>\u201cI make joke.\u201d He said plainly which brought a small smile to your face while Missandei laughed and Tyrion let out a soft Chuckle while Lucia pet her cat quietly.</p><p>\u201cMore jokes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The Madam says\u2014\u201c</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s joke was interrupted by bells ringing outside the pyrimid. You stood placing a hand on Lucia\u2019s shoulder while both Missandi and Grey Worm stood as well.</p><p>You followed after Grey Worm as he ran to the door of the room. You grabbed your sword off of one of the tables you had placed it on.</p><p>The masters had come for their property.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You could do nothing but put Lucia in a cupboard with Ser Robb and a toy or two with a blanket and a pillow to keep her arm. The sound of shouting from outside and the sound of catapults launching whatever they had loaded was a clear sound you thought you\u2019d never hear again.</p><p>You were wrong.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. I admit it.\u201d Tyrion said entering the room with Missandei while you stood next to Grey Worm</p><p>\u201cThat changes nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers\u2019 forces\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.\u201d Grey Worm interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have acknowledged that I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyrion! Your talking has gotten you into some bad situations, but now you\u2019ve got an entire city in danger! Your little outburst at your trial is the reason you\u2019re here! You could have gone to the night\u2019s watch instead if you had kept your mouth shut! You\u2019re trying to tell us what the army should do! You don\u2019t know what the army should do!\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sighed slightly at you yelling at him. No one could ever calm you down when you were angry like you were now. Only Jaime and Cersei had been able to when you were little and easier to pick up and put in a corner.</p><p>\u201cAll right, what should the army do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go to the beach.\u201d You said carefully. \u201cIf we go to the beach, the masters will see their chance to take the Pyramid. Whoever has the Pyramid had Meereen. We stay here. We defend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait for them to come to us. Then we fight.\u201d</p><p>A sudden sound of a crash from outside against the pyramid walls made you look up at the ceiling. That wasn\u2019t what was in a catapult.</p><p>You looked to Grey Worm and he nodded. Grabbing your sword you strapped it to your waist and followed Grey Worm, the others following the two of you as well.</p><p>You got into a defensive position. Some unsullied going to the door, spears up while you unsheathed your sword and held it up ready to hit whoever was right outside.</p><p>Grey Worm took out a small knife and held it defensively as well. Ready for a fight. Very carefully an unsullied open the door and one walked through very carefully with their shield up while the rest of you stayed.</p><p>Suddenly the unsullied got on one knee. Your brows furrowed tightly before Daenerys walked trough the door.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You all stood. In a straight line across from the three masters. Who represented the slave cities that were trying to take Meereen.</p><p>\u201cOnce before I had offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver\u2019s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.\u201d</p><p>You looked out to the water. Ships upon ships of all sizes flinging giant balls of fire at the city which had been freed over two years ago.</p><p>\u201cWe are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.\u201d Tyrion said flatly with a straight strong posture as he stood in front of the masters.</p><p>\u201cThe terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys Mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys Mo Naklos will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>Your brows rose up as you looked at the three men. They honestly believed Daenerys would be the one surrendering today?</p><p>\u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t communicate clearly. We\u2019re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.\u201d She clarified looking at the men.</p><p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s difficult adjusting to the new reality. Your reign in over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reign has just begun.\u201d</p><p>A small smirk spread across your face as a dragon\u2019s screech ripped through the air. The masters turned but before they could her third dragon flew above you all. The one you had seen flying over old Valyria. The one who had flew Daenerys out of the arena. The dragon then landed on the old watch tower above you all. </p><p>You looked up at the dragon as he screeched even louder before jumping down next to Daenerys, his head coming up next to her own.</p><p>You watched as the queen climbed onto the back of her dragon and flew off of the cliff with him knocking over the master\u2019s soldiers.</p><p>You watched. You watched with a smirk as the other two dragons broke free from their dungeon beneath the pyramid and flew to the ships as well. And an almost satisfied smirk as they set the ships on tire.</p><p>Grey Worm stepped forward and spoke to the master\u2019s soldiers in Valyrian. The men placed down their weapons and ran down the hill to the main ground.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now last time we spoke. We made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.\u201d Missandei said</p><p>\u201cIt always seems a bit abstract, doesn\u2019t it, other people dying?\u201d</p><p>One of the masters pushed forward another </p><p>\u201cHim! He should die\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes him!\u201d The other piped in in a worried manner.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not one of us. He\u2019s an outsider, lowborn! He does not speak for us.\u201d </p><p>Grey Worm and you both walked forward. His hands behind his back while one of your hands rested on the hilt of your sword and the other rested at your side. You both came up to the man they had been pushing forward.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The man pleaded dropping to his knees \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>You pulled out the dagger from your waist and cut through one of the master\u2019s throats while Grey Worm cut through the other\u2019s. Leaving the one in the middle.</p><p>You and Grey Worm both stepped back without a word while you straightened out the skirt of your dress and fixed the sleeves as well.</p><p>Tyrion stepped forward and placed a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder</p><p>\u201cTell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind them what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You never wanted to see his face again. The little rat who betrayed the Starks for his own glory. Just to prove himself to a father he hadn\u2019t seen in years. Not since he was just a child. </p><p>\u201cLast time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height I seem to recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I saw him, was in dream of me slitting cutting his head off and sewing an octopuses head on his neck.\u201d You said bitterly holding onto Lucia\u2019s hand tightly. </p><p>\u201cYes, I heard you telling Varys that on the ship to Pentos. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf\u2019s height thinks he\u2019s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf\u2019s height.\u201d</p><p>Yara and Theon fucking Greyjoy. In front of your very eyes. The moment you had heard of Theon betraying Robb you wanted to kill him. You wanted to kill him four almost five years ago as well when he had made Jon so upset he had come into your quarters angry. You had let Jon rant until someone his head was in your lap and you were singing.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The height of nobility\u2019 \u2018A man of your stature,\u2019 \u2018someone to look up to.\u2019 You\u2019re all making the same five or six jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas making Jon Snow so angry he came to me almost in tears of rage because of you a \u2018long time ago\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Theon looked to you. He didn\u2019t seem to really recognize you. But then he did. He looked from you to the little girl who\u2019s hand you had a strong grasp on held her doll in her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Tyrion confirmed \u201cAnd how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can\u2019t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t murder them.\u201d You said harshly. \u201cHe may have wanted to but he never would have. But he did things just as bad I gather. Maybe worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he paid for them.\u201d Yara interjected </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it. He\u2019s still alive. It was complicated for you, I\u2019m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were.\u201d Tyrion breathed looking over the young man in front of you. \u201cBut then, we all live complicated lives, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought us a hundred ships form the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my claim. Hers.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looks at Theon questionably, her legs crossed and in what looked to be an awkward position \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fit to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we can agree on that.\u201d You spat with venom laced in your voice so heavily you almost sounded like Joffrey or your mother.</p><p>\u201cHas the Iron islands ever had a queen before? No more than Westeros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Thron from Yara. He would have murdered us if we\u2019d stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pity that would have been.\u201d You sneered.</p><p>\u201cBe nice.\u201d Tyrion warned</p><p>\u201cHave I stabbed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m being nice.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys and Tyrion looked at you concerned while Yara gave you a look and Theon just eyes the dark haired little girl who\u2019s head was against your hip while she swayed her body in a childlike fashion.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion tell me your father was a terrible king. You and I have that in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d Daenerys said with a little bit of irritation in her voice. \u201cAnd both murdered by a usurper as well. Will their ships be enough?\u201d Daenerys asked turning her head to look at Tyrion.</p><p>\u201cWith the former Masters\u2019 fleet, possibly. Barley. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.\u201d</p><p>Theon nodded \u201cThere are and Euron is building more. He\u2019s going to offer them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why shouldn\u2019t I wait for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Iron Fleet isn\u2019t all he\u2019s bringing. He also wants to give you\u2014 \u201c</p><p>\u201cHis big cock, I think he said.\u201d Yara finished for Theon.</p><p>You found it slightly amusing how some men could hype up something that they know isn\u2019t there. It could be there, but they hype it up so much that what they say you know isn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cEuron\u2019s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You don\u2019t get one without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?\u201d Daenerys questioned</p><p>\u201cI never demand, but I\u2019m up for anything, really.\u201d Yara said with a small teasing smile.</p><p>\u201cHe murdered out father and would have murdered us. He\u2019ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Seven Kingdoms.\u201d Tyrion said more like a statement than a question.</p><p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d Theon confirmed</p><p>You reached down grabbing under Lucia\u2019s arms and picked her up resting her against your hip. You hand resting on her bottom to keep her from slipping down.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want the seven kingdoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you give them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don\u2019t think a woman\u2019s fit to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasonable.\u201d</p><hr><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> @<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingsholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>\u00a0 @<a href=\"https://veggidinosaurnuggets.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">veggiedinosaurnuggets</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> @<a href=\"http://emilielskov.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">emilieskov</a> @kayylluhh <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p></p>",

It\u2019s what he\u2019s best at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s letting them keep slaves for another seven years.\u201d Missandei said with a certain venom in her voice. She never did seem like the type to be angry often. </p><p>You nodded and looked to the bed. Lucia asleep, with the covers pulled around her small body. She was much smaller than a normal three year old should be. She was still just a kid though. Who seemed to be more and more shy everyday. So much too to the point she only talked to you, Varys and Tyrion. Even though she seemed very curious with Missandei and Grey Worm.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m happy about this? Every time I think of a woman forced to be in a whorehouse. I think of the children born to those women who were ripped from their arms and sold like cattle. I think of my own daughter. What if I had never been born a Lannister? And her father had just been passing through a slave city and spent a night in a brothel with me? And nine months later she had been born? The moment I had her crying in my arms I didn\u2019t want to let go. I couldn\u2019t imagine someone ripping her out of my arms before I even had the chance to name her.\u201d</p><p>Missandei\u2019s face softened as she looked over to the sleeping child who\u2019s hair surrounded her shoulders and face. Her long eyelashes brushing against her cheeks like her father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI could never imagine her with chains.\u201d Missandei said.</p><p>You could never imagine her in chains either. Such a small girl with barely any muscle. Tyrion had suggested that you begin to teach her how to sword fight. He said that it would help her build muscle that she needed to gain and that a lot of little boys bagan to learn when they turned four. That Jaime had started to learn at 4 and a half.</p><p>You had begun to think about it. It never hurt to teach her early. You could get a wooden sparing sword fit for her size, you could start teaching her how to avoid certain situation if they ever arose. You had made a promise to yourself and to her the day she was born. You made a promise to protect her. And you wouldn\u2019t be there for her all the time even if you wanted to be. She would one day be on her own, and if a man decided to put their hands on her you wanted to be sure she knew how to defend herself</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cSince our pact with the masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?\u201d</p><p>Lucia fidgeted in your arms as she tried to rest her head. You had begun to teach her the basics. How to hold a sword. She struggled with it and was overly exhausted by having to hold it in her hands. You had been taught when you were seven and onwards. Most people from less powerful houses started learning then. But the only reason you had started then was because you were a girl.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Grey Worm answered</p><p>\u201cAnd how many Masters have been killed by the free men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo, but that was the day of the pact.\u201d</p><p>Varys and Tyrion had made a deal with the masters. Allowed to keep work the slaves out by the end of a seven year mark. You knew seven years could make a big difference in someone\u2019s life. A fortnight had made a big deal to you. </p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s safe to say a fragile peace had taken hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d You replied as Lucia whined lowly as her dark eyes fluttered shut as she finally found a position in your arms to get comfortable in. </p><p>\u201cFor now is the best we get in our profession.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion was walking back and forth, a sort of pacing with a cup of wine in his hand while he did it. Its what he was good at, drinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d Tyrion said as he kept pacing </p><p>\u201cConsidering the city was on the brink of civil war, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just for Meereen to have peace.\u201d You said quietly </p><p>\u201cThey need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t responsible for a peace meeting she wasn\u2019t here for.\u201d</p><p>Very quickly you were beginning to see that what Daenerys had taken as her\u2019s was crumbling. She had taken it and as a naive child she thought it would hold under her reign. She was a whole year older than you and you could see the errors in her ways of taking control. She believed everything could become a normal for the citizens. </p><p>\u201cThe Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.\u201d</p><p>The Unburnt. </p><p>You looked down at Lucia carefully. A child who just like the queen could touch a flame and be unharmed. Who could hold hot wax and not a mark be on her. You didn\u2019t know how. You didn\u2019t know if you wanted to know. You just knew that you probably shouldn\u2019t tell anyone.</p><p>\u201cThe people know who brought them freedom.\u201d Missandei said</p><p>\u201cYes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust. Someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.\u201d</p><p>You held Lucia\u2019s head as she began moving again to get comfortable. Never quite finding the perfect position to fall asleep in.</p><p>\u201cSounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about \u2018him?\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cSo? This farewell?\u201d</p><p>Varys nodded as he held a cloth bag in his hands. He was leaving for Westeros. The queen needed allies in the west if she was to take the Iron Throne. She would need as many allies as she could gather to help her fight. People who hated the Lannisters. You just hoped that Tyrion, Lucia and your own safety would be secured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I do have something for you however.\u201d </p><p>One of your brows went up while the other went down in curiosity. Something that had developed in the muscles in your face. He reached into the bag and took out a small box and handed it to you. </p><p>It was a deep red colored wood, from an old tree no doubt. It had hinges on it, meant to be a storage box for whatever was in it. You grabbed the lip of the lid and lifted it. No squeaking. Thank the gods. When you opened it you came face to face with a stationary set. Loads of slim long papers you could turn into a raven scroll and normal sheets of paper you could use for a hand delivered letter. There was a pen and ink in the box as well. There where sticks of yellow wax and a stamp seal. Carefully you held the box in your left hand and picked up the stamp seal with the other to look at what it had. It was a fairly large stamp seal. Looking at it, it had a lion in the middle, with a stag to the right of it and a rose to left.</p><p>You smiled and looked at Varys. This was perfect. You\u2019d never had a stationary set before nor had you ever had your own stamp seal with a personalized sigil on it. </p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you for everything you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d You said with a grateful smile.</p><p>He nodded and then looked to Lucia who was playing with the doll Loras had given her for her first name day.</p><p>\u201cI also have something for you little lion.\u201d</p><p>You could feel chills going up your back as you heard that phrase. He walked over to her held a hand out for her to take. \u201cI have a gift for you. What do you say we go and get it?\u201d</p><p>You smiled as Varys left the room with Lucia who had happily without a word followed him out. You placed the box on the table of your room and smiled. You already knew who your first letter would be to.</p><p>No even a moment later Lucia came back in with a big smile holding something that was a pure white in her arms. Turning your head to see what it was, you saw a small cat in her arms who seemed to have settled in.</p><p>\u201cMama! Look! It\u2019s a baby lion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a kitten, Luci. Was this Varys\u2019s gift to you?\u201d You asked kneeling down next to her to look at the long hair cat.</p><p>She nodded happily and held the small animal to her. \u201cWhat do I name him?\u201d</p><p>You looked at the small thing curiously and smiled as you came to a realization. \u201cRobb. Let\u2019s name him Ser Robb. Like your uncle Tommen named his cat Ser Pounce.\u201d</p><p>Robb was one of her other uncles. Not that she had ever met him. She could only really remember Tommen if she was lucky.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to our queen!\u201d</p><p>You held your wine glass higher than Missandei and Greyworm were and Lucia seemed more distracted by dangling the ribbon she had taken out of her hair above Ser Robb.</p><p>\u201cAnyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.\u201d Tyrion said in a desperate attempt to get Grey Worm and Missandei to drink the red liquid in their cups.</p><p>Grey Worm and Missandei slowly raised their cups up for whatever toast your uncle would give to the missing queen.</p><p>\u201cTo Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, Long may she reign.\u201d</p><p>All of you including little Lucia repeated his last words. \u201cLong may she reign.\u201d You quickly drank the entire glass of wine and placed it down on the table while Grey Worm and Missandei took careful sips.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Tyrion asked the two</p><p>\u201cTastes like it has turned.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion nodded as he walked around Lucia and to the canister of wine and filled his cup up once again. To think you used to chastise him for drinking to much. To think you threw a full canister of wine over a parapet for arranging Trystane and Myrcella\u2019s wedding. </p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms\u2026 I\u2019d like to have my vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp\u2019s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.\u201d</p><p>You smiled at the thought. You could practically see Tyrion at Casterly Rock with a Vineyard in the gardens. Making wine and sending it in crates to people he knew well enough to trust with what wine he had made.</p><p>\u201cTell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion had made his way back over to where you were all sitting as \u00a0Lucia had picked up her kitten and sat down next to you once more. The white ball of fluff sitting in her lap tired out after it\u2019s jumping to try and get the red ribbon that Lucia had now tied around his neck in a bow.</p><p>\u201cI do not know any jokes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion looked a bit put out by this as his attention then went to the commander of The Unsullied</p><p>\u201cGrey Worm.\u201d</p><p>He remained quiet as he looked at your uncle with a blank face.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head \u201cI don\u2019t have any good jokes.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sighed as he filled his cup up more and eyes the small kitten in your daughter\u2019s lap as he took a sip from his glass.</p><p>\u201cThree lords walk into a tavern\u2014A Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven hells.\u201d You murmured to yourself. Missandei and Grey Worm would never understand this joke. They weren\u2019t from Westeros. They didn\u2019t understand the inner workings of the houses and how they worked with or against each other.</p><p>\u201cThey order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outrages, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, \u201cSpit it out you wee shit. Spit it out!\u201d</p><p>Both Grey Worm and Missandei remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhich lords of those three houses? Which Stark? The one beheaded who\u2019s head was put on a spike? The ones who were killed by the Areys Targaryen? Or the one who was beheaded and who\u2019s direwolf\u2019s head was sewn onto his own neck? Which Martell? Oberyn? Who died for you? For his sister, niece and nephew? To try and get vengeance? Or his brother? King of Dorne? Who was stabbed by Ellaria Sand?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t mean for it to come out. It just did. Your family had seen so many family houses die out in the past thirty years. First the Reynes of Castamere. Then the Targaryens, then the Baratheons, almost all of House Stark and then all of House Martell.</p><p>Tyrion remained quiet as he looked at you. He knew you had a special bond with Ned Stark. Something that had happened very quickly after one of Jaime\u2019s men stabbed Ned in the back of the leg. Right around the time you had been begun to get farther along in your pregnancy with Lucia.</p><p>\u201cThe Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t before.\u201d You said bitterly</p><p>Tyrion cringed at the tense air in the room and looked at Missandei \u201cLet\u2019s lighten the mood, tell a joke!\u201d He insisted again.</p><p>Missandei nodded hesitantly \u201cTwo translators are on a sinking ship, and one asks the other \u201cCan you swim?\u201d And the other says \u201cNow but I can shout for help in nineteen languages.\u201d </p><p>You remained quiet as did Grey Worm, while Tyrion forced an awkward laugh</p><p>\u201cThat was the worst joke I ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what a joke is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am solider. You think I never hear a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lied to us?\u201d Tyrion asked playfully.</p><p>\u201cI make joke.\u201d He said plainly which brought a small smile to your face while Missandei laughed and Tyrion let out a soft Chuckle while Lucia pet her cat quietly.</p><p>\u201cMore jokes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The Madam says\u2014\u201c</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s joke was interrupted by bells ringing outside the pyrimid. You stood placing a hand on Lucia\u2019s shoulder while both Missandi and Grey Worm stood as well.</p><p>You followed after Grey Worm as he ran to the door of the room. You grabbed your sword off of one of the tables you had placed it on.</p><p>The masters had come for their property.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You could do nothing but put Lucia in a cupboard with Ser Robb and a toy or two with a blanket and a pillow to keep her arm. The sound of shouting from outside and the sound of catapults launching whatever they had loaded was a clear sound you thought you\u2019d never hear again.</p><p>You were wrong.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. I admit it.\u201d Tyrion said entering the room with Missandei while you stood next to Grey Worm</p><p>\u201cThat changes nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers\u2019 forces\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.\u201d Grey Worm interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have acknowledged that I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyrion! Your talking has gotten you into some bad situations, but now you\u2019ve got an entire city in danger! Your little outburst at your trial is the reason you\u2019re here! You could have gone to the night\u2019s watch instead if you had kept your mouth shut! You\u2019re trying to tell us what the army should do! You don\u2019t know what the army should do!\u201d</p><p>Tyrion sighed slightly at you yelling at him. No one could ever calm you down when you were angry like you were now. Only Jaime and Cersei had been able to when you were little and easier to pick up and put in a corner.</p><p>\u201cAll right, what should the army do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go to the beach.\u201d You said carefully. \u201cIf we go to the beach, the masters will see their chance to take the Pyramid. Whoever has the Pyramid had Meereen. We stay here. We defend it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait for them to come to us. Then we fight.\u201d</p><p>A sudden sound of a crash from outside against the pyramid walls made you look up at the ceiling. That wasn\u2019t what was in a catapult.</p><p>You looked to Grey Worm and he nodded. Grabbing your sword you strapped it to your waist and followed Grey Worm, the others following the two of you as well.</p><p>You got into a defensive position. Some unsullied going to the door, spears up while you unsheathed your sword and held it up ready to hit whoever was right outside.</p><p>Grey Worm took out a small knife and held it defensively as well. Ready for a fight. Very carefully an unsullied open the door and one walked through very carefully with their shield up while the rest of you stayed.</p><p>Suddenly the unsullied got on one knee. Your brows furrowed tightly before Daenerys walked trough the door.</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You all stood. In a straight line across from the three masters. Who represented the slave cities that were trying to take Meereen.</p><p>\u201cOnce before I had offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver\u2019s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.\u201d</p><p>You looked out to the water. Ships upon ships of all sizes flinging giant balls of fire at the city which had been freed over two years ago.</p><p>\u201cWe are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.\u201d Tyrion said flatly with a straight strong posture as he stood in front of the masters.</p><p>\u201cThe terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys Mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys Mo Naklos will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>Your brows rose up as you looked at the three men. They honestly believed Daenerys would be the one surrendering today?</p><p>\u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t communicate clearly. We\u2019re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.\u201d She clarified looking at the men.</p><p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s difficult adjusting to the new reality. Your reign in over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reign has just begun.\u201d</p><p>A small smirk spread across your face as a dragon\u2019s screech ripped through the air. The masters turned but before they could her third dragon flew above you all. The one you had seen flying over old Valyria. The one who had flew Daenerys out of the arena. The dragon then landed on the old watch tower above you all. </p><p>You looked up at the dragon as he screeched even louder before jumping down next to Daenerys, his head coming up next to her own.</p><p>You watched as the queen climbed onto the back of her dragon and flew off of the cliff with him knocking over the master\u2019s soldiers.</p><p>You watched. You watched with a smirk as the other two dragons broke free from their dungeon beneath the pyramid and flew to the ships as well. And an almost satisfied smirk as they set the ships on tire.</p><p>Grey Worm stepped forward and spoke to the master\u2019s soldiers in Valyrian. The men placed down their weapons and ran down the hill to the main ground.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now last time we spoke. We made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.\u201d Missandei said</p><p>\u201cIt always seems a bit abstract, doesn\u2019t it, other people dying?\u201d</p><p>One of the masters pushed forward another </p><p>\u201cHim! He should die\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes him!\u201d The other piped in in a worried manner.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not one of us. He\u2019s an outsider, lowborn! He does not speak for us.\u201d </p><p>Grey Worm and you both walked forward. His hands behind his back while one of your hands rested on the hilt of your sword and the other rested at your side. You both came up to the man they had been pushing forward.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The man pleaded dropping to his knees \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>You pulled out the dagger from your waist and cut through one of the master\u2019s throats while Grey Worm cut through the other\u2019s. Leaving the one in the middle.</p><p>You and Grey Worm both stepped back without a word while you straightened out the skirt of your dress and fixed the sleeves as well.</p><p>Tyrion stepped forward and placed a hand on the man\u2019s shoulder</p><p>\u201cTell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind them what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><hr><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>You never wanted to see his face again. The little rat who betrayed the Starks for his own glory. Just to prove himself to a father he hadn\u2019t seen in years. Not since he was just a child. </p><p>\u201cLast time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height I seem to recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I saw him, was in dream of me slitting cutting his head off and sewing an octopuses head on his neck.\u201d You said bitterly holding onto Lucia\u2019s hand tightly. </p><p>\u201cYes, I heard you telling Varys that on the ship to Pentos. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf\u2019s height thinks he\u2019s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf\u2019s height.\u201d</p><p>Yara and Theon fucking Greyjoy. In front of your very eyes. The moment you had heard of Theon betraying Robb you wanted to kill him. You wanted to kill him four almost five years ago as well when he had made Jon so upset he had come into your quarters angry. You had let Jon rant until someone his head was in your lap and you were singing.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The height of nobility\u2019 \u2018A man of your stature,\u2019 \u2018someone to look up to.\u2019 You\u2019re all making the same five or six jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas making Jon Snow so angry he came to me almost in tears of rage because of you a \u2018long time ago\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Theon looked to you. He didn\u2019t seem to really recognize you. But then he did. He looked from you to the little girl who\u2019s hand you had a strong grasp on held her doll in her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Tyrion confirmed \u201cAnd how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can\u2019t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t murder them.\u201d You said harshly. \u201cHe may have wanted to but he never would have. But he did things just as bad I gather. Maybe worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he paid for them.\u201d Yara interjected </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like it. He\u2019s still alive. It was complicated for you, I\u2019m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were.\u201d Tyrion breathed looking over the young man in front of you. \u201cBut then, we all live complicated lives, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought us a hundred ships form the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my claim. Hers.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys looks at Theon questionably, her legs crossed and in what looked to be an awkward position \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fit to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we can agree on that.\u201d You spat with venom laced in your voice so heavily you almost sounded like Joffrey or your mother.</p><p>\u201cHas the Iron islands ever had a queen before? No more than Westeros.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Thron from Yara. He would have murdered us if we\u2019d stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pity that would have been.\u201d You sneered.</p><p>\u201cBe nice.\u201d Tyrion warned</p><p>\u201cHave I stabbed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m being nice.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys and Tyrion looked at you concerned while Yara gave you a look and Theon just eyes the dark haired little girl who\u2019s head was against your hip while she swayed her body in a childlike fashion.</p><p>\u201cLord Tyrion tell me your father was a terrible king. You and I have that in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d Daenerys said with a little bit of irritation in her voice. \u201cAnd both murdered by a usurper as well. Will their ships be enough?\u201d Daenerys asked turning her head to look at Tyrion.</p><p>\u201cWith the former Masters\u2019 fleet, possibly. Barley. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.\u201d</p><p>Theon nodded \u201cThere are and Euron is building more. He\u2019s going to offer them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why shouldn\u2019t I wait for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Iron Fleet isn\u2019t all he\u2019s bringing. He also wants to give you\u2014 \u201c</p><p>\u201cHis big cock, I think he said.\u201d Yara finished for Theon.</p><p>You found it slightly amusing how some men could hype up something that they know isn\u2019t there. It could be there, but they hype it up so much that what they say you know isn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cEuron\u2019s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You don\u2019t get one without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?\u201d Daenerys questioned</p><p>\u201cI never demand, but I\u2019m up for anything, really.\u201d Yara said with a small teasing smile.</p><p>\u201cHe murdered out father and would have murdered us. He\u2019ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Seven Kingdoms.\u201d Tyrion said more like a statement than a question.</p><p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d Theon confirmed</p><p>You reached down grabbing under Lucia\u2019s arms and picked her up resting her against your hip. You hand resting on her bottom to keep her from slipping down.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want the seven kingdoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you give them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don\u2019t think a woman\u2019s fit to rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasonable.\u201d</p><hr><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> @<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingsholland</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>\u00a0 @<a href=\"https://veggidinosaurnuggets.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">veggiedinosaurnuggets</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> @<a href=\"http://emilielskov.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">emilieskov</a> @kayylluhh <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p></p>",

It&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s best at.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s letting them keep slaves for another seven years.&rdquo; Missandei said with a certain venom in her voice. She never did seem like the type to be angry often. </p><p>You nodded and looked to the bed. Lucia asleep, with the covers pulled around her small body. She was much smaller than a normal three year old should be. She was still just a kid though. Who seemed to be more and more shy everyday. So much too to the point she only talked to you, Varys and Tyrion. Even though she seemed very curious with Missandei and Grey Worm.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m happy about this? Every time I think of a woman forced to be in a whorehouse. I think of the children born to those women who were ripped from their arms and sold like cattle. I think of my own daughter. What if I had never been born a Lannister? And her father had just been passing through a slave city and spent a night in a brothel with me? And nine months later she had been born? The moment I had her crying in my arms I didn&rsquo;t want to let go. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine someone ripping her out of my arms before I even had the chance to name her.&rdquo;</p><p>Missandei&rsquo;s face softened as she looked over to the sleeping child who&rsquo;s hair surrounded her shoulders and face. Her long eyelashes brushing against her cheeks like her father&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;I could never imagine her with chains.&rdquo; Missandei said.</p><p>You could never imagine her in chains either. Such a small girl with barely any muscle. Tyrion had suggested that you begin to teach her how to sword fight. He said that it would help her build muscle that she needed to gain and that a lot of little boys bagan to learn when they turned four. That Jaime had started to learn at 4 and a half.</p><p>You had begun to think about it. It never hurt to teach her early. You could get a wooden sparing sword fit for her size, you could start teaching her how to avoid certain situation if they ever arose. You had made a promise to yourself and to her the day she was born. You made a promise to protect her. And you wouldn&rsquo;t be there for her all the time even if you wanted to be. She would one day be on her own, and if a man decided to put their hands on her you wanted to be sure she knew how to defend herself</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Since our pact with the masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?&rdquo;</p><p>Lucia fidgeted in your arms as she tried to rest her head. You had begun to teach her the basics. How to hold a sword. She struggled with it and was overly exhausted by having to hold it in her hands. You had been taught when you were seven and onwards. Most people from less powerful houses started learning then. But the only reason you had started then was because you were a girl.</p><p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo; Grey Worm answered</p><p>&ldquo;And how many Masters have been killed by the free men?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two, but that was the day of the pact.&rdquo;</p><p>Varys and Tyrion had made a deal with the masters. Allowed to keep work the slaves out by the end of a seven year mark. You knew seven years could make a big difference in someone&rsquo;s life. A fortnight had made a big deal to you. </p><p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s safe to say a fragile peace had taken hold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For now.&rdquo; You replied as Lucia whined lowly as her dark eyes fluttered shut as she finally found a position in your arms to get comfortable in. </p><p>&ldquo;For now is the best we get in our profession.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion was walking back and forth, a sort of pacing with a cup of wine in his hand while he did it. Its what he was good at, drinking.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough.&rdquo; Tyrion said as he kept pacing </p><p>&ldquo;Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a good start.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough just for Meereen to have peace.&rdquo; You said quietly </p><p>&ldquo;They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t responsible for a peace meeting she wasn&rsquo;t here for.&rdquo;</p><p>Very quickly you were beginning to see that what Daenerys had taken as her&rsquo;s was crumbling. She had taken it and as a naive child she thought it would hold under her reign. She was a whole year older than you and you could see the errors in her ways of taking control. She believed everything could become a normal for the citizens. </p><p>&ldquo;The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.&rdquo;</p><p>The Unburnt. </p><p>You looked down at Lucia carefully. A child who just like the queen could touch a flame and be unharmed. Who could hold hot wax and not a mark be on her. You didn&rsquo;t know how. You didn&rsquo;t know if you wanted to know. You just knew that you probably shouldn&rsquo;t tell anyone.</p><p>&ldquo;The people know who brought them freedom.&rdquo; Missandei said</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust. Someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.&rdquo;</p><p>You held Lucia&rsquo;s head as she began moving again to get comfortable. Never quite finding the perfect position to fall asleep in.</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said anything about &lsquo;him?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So? This farewell?&rdquo;</p><p>Varys nodded as he held a cloth bag in his hands. He was leaving for Westeros. The queen needed allies in the west if she was to take the Iron Throne. She would need as many allies as she could gather to help her fight. People who hated the Lannisters. You just hoped that Tyrion, Lucia and your own safety would be secured.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. I do have something for you however.&rdquo; </p><p>One of your brows went up while the other went down in curiosity. Something that had developed in the muscles in your face. He reached into the bag and took out a small box and handed it to you. </p><p>It was a deep red colored wood, from an old tree no doubt. It had hinges on it, meant to be a storage box for whatever was in it. You grabbed the lip of the lid and lifted it. No squeaking. Thank the gods. When you opened it you came face to face with a stationary set. Loads of slim long papers you could turn into a raven scroll and normal sheets of paper you could use for a hand delivered letter. There was a pen and ink in the box as well. There where sticks of yellow wax and a stamp seal. Carefully you held the box in your left hand and picked up the stamp seal with the other to look at what it had. It was a fairly large stamp seal. Looking at it, it had a lion in the middle, with a stag to the right of it and a rose to left.</p><p>You smiled and looked at Varys. This was perfect. You&rsquo;d never had a stationary set before nor had you ever had your own stamp seal with a personalized sigil on it. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. Thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve ever done.&rdquo; You said with a grateful smile.</p><p>He nodded and then looked to Lucia who was playing with the doll Loras had given her for her first name day.</p><p>&ldquo;I also have something for you little lion.&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel chills going up your back as you heard that phrase. He walked over to her held a hand out for her to take. &ldquo;I have a gift for you. What do you say we go and get it?&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled as Varys left the room with Lucia who had happily without a word followed him out. You placed the box on the table of your room and smiled. You already knew who your first letter would be to.</p><p>No even a moment later Lucia came back in with a big smile holding something that was a pure white in her arms. Turning your head to see what it was, you saw a small cat in her arms who seemed to have settled in.</p><p>&ldquo;Mama! Look! It&rsquo;s a baby lion!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a kitten, Luci. Was this Varys&rsquo;s gift to you?&rdquo; You asked kneeling down next to her to look at the long hair cat.</p><p>She nodded happily and held the small animal to her. &ldquo;What do I name him?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at the small thing curiously and smiled as you came to a realization. &ldquo;Robb. Let&rsquo;s name him Ser Robb. Like your uncle Tommen named his cat Ser Pounce.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb was one of her other uncles. Not that she had ever met him. She could only really remember Tommen if she was lucky.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to our queen!&rdquo;</p><p>You held your wine glass higher than Missandei and Greyworm were and Lucia seemed more distracted by dangling the ribbon she had taken out of her hair above Ser Robb.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.&rdquo; Tyrion said in a desperate attempt to get Grey Worm and Missandei to drink the red liquid in their cups.</p><p>Grey Worm and Missandei slowly raised their cups up for whatever toast your uncle would give to the missing queen.</p><p>&ldquo;To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, Long may she reign.&rdquo;</p><p>All of you including little Lucia repeated his last words. &ldquo;Long may she reign.&rdquo; You quickly drank the entire glass of wine and placed it down on the table while Grey Worm and Missandei took careful sips.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; Tyrion asked the two</p><p>&ldquo;Tastes like it has turned.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion nodded as he walked around Lucia and to the canister of wine and filled his cup up once again. To think you used to chastise him for drinking to much. To think you threw a full canister of wine over a parapet for arranging Trystane and Myrcella&rsquo;s wedding. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms&hellip; I&rsquo;d like to have my vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp&rsquo;s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled at the thought. You could practically see Tyrion at Casterly Rock with a Vineyard in the gardens. Making wine and sending it in crates to people he knew well enough to trust with what wine he had made.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion had made his way back over to where you were all sitting as &nbsp;Lucia had picked up her kitten and sat down next to you once more. The white ball of fluff sitting in her lap tired out after it&rsquo;s jumping to try and get the red ribbon that Lucia had now tied around his neck in a bow.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know any jokes.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion looked a bit put out by this as his attention then went to the commander of The Unsullied</p><p>&ldquo;Grey Worm.&rdquo;</p><p>He remained quiet as he looked at your uncle with a blank face.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any good jokes.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion sighed as he filled his cup up more and eyes the small kitten in your daughter&rsquo;s lap as he took a sip from his glass.</p><p>&ldquo;Three lords walk into a tavern&mdash;A Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seven hells.&rdquo; You murmured to yourself. Missandei and Grey Worm would never understand this joke. They weren&rsquo;t from Westeros. They didn&rsquo;t understand the inner workings of the houses and how they worked with or against each other.</p><p>&ldquo;They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outrages, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, &ldquo;Spit it out you wee shit. Spit it out!&rdquo;</p><p>Both Grey Worm and Missandei remained quiet.</p><p>&ldquo;Which lords of those three houses? Which Stark? The one beheaded who&rsquo;s head was put on a spike? The ones who were killed by the Areys Targaryen? Or the one who was beheaded and who&rsquo;s direwolf&rsquo;s head was sewn onto his own neck? Which Martell? Oberyn? Who died for you? For his sister, niece and nephew? To try and get vengeance? Or his brother? King of Dorne? Who was stabbed by Ellaria Sand?&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t mean for it to come out. It just did. Your family had seen so many family houses die out in the past thirty years. First the Reynes of Castamere. Then the Targaryens, then the Baratheons, almost all of House Stark and then all of House Martell.</p><p>Tyrion remained quiet as he looked at you. He knew you had a special bond with Ned Stark. Something that had happened very quickly after one of Jaime&rsquo;s men stabbed Ned in the back of the leg. Right around the time you had been begun to get farther along in your pregnancy with Lucia.</p><p>&ldquo;The Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t before.&rdquo; You said bitterly</p><p>Tyrion cringed at the tense air in the room and looked at Missandei &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s lighten the mood, tell a joke!&rdquo; He insisted again.</p><p>Missandei nodded hesitantly &ldquo;Two translators are on a sinking ship, and one asks the other &ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo; And the other says &ldquo;Now but I can shout for help in nineteen languages.&rdquo; </p><p>You remained quiet as did Grey Worm, while Tyrion forced an awkward laugh</p><p>&ldquo;That was the worst joke I ever heard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know what a joke is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am solider. You think I never hear a joke?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you lied to us?&rdquo; Tyrion asked playfully.</p><p>&ldquo;I make joke.&rdquo; He said plainly which brought a small smile to your face while Missandei laughed and Tyrion let out a soft Chuckle while Lucia pet her cat quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;More jokes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The Madam says&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>Tyrion&rsquo;s joke was interrupted by bells ringing outside the pyrimid. You stood placing a hand on Lucia&rsquo;s shoulder while both Missandi and Grey Worm stood as well.</p><p>You followed after Grey Worm as he ran to the door of the room. You grabbed your sword off of one of the tables you had placed it on.</p><p>The masters had come for their property.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You could do nothing but put Lucia in a cupboard with Ser Robb and a toy or two with a blanket and a pillow to keep her arm. The sound of shouting from outside and the sound of catapults launching whatever they had loaded was a clear sound you thought you&rsquo;d never hear again.</p><p>You were wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;I was wrong. I admit it.&rdquo; Tyrion said entering the room with Missandei while you stood next to Grey Worm</p><p>&ldquo;That changes nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers&rsquo; forces&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.&rdquo; Grey Worm interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;And I have acknowledged that I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tyrion! Your talking has gotten you into some bad situations, but now you&rsquo;ve got an entire city in danger! Your little outburst at your trial is the reason you&rsquo;re here! You could have gone to the night&rsquo;s watch instead if you had kept your mouth shut! You&rsquo;re trying to tell us what the army should do! You don&rsquo;t know what the army should do!&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion sighed slightly at you yelling at him. No one could ever calm you down when you were angry like you were now. Only Jaime and Cersei had been able to when you were little and easier to pick up and put in a corner.</p><p>&ldquo;All right, what should the army do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go to the beach.&rdquo; You said carefully. &ldquo;If we go to the beach, the masters will see their chance to take the Pyramid. Whoever has the Pyramid had Meereen. We stay here. We defend it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight.&rdquo;</p><p>A sudden sound of a crash from outside against the pyramid walls made you look up at the ceiling. That wasn&rsquo;t what was in a catapult.</p><p>You looked to Grey Worm and he nodded. Grabbing your sword you strapped it to your waist and followed Grey Worm, the others following the two of you as well.</p><p>You got into a defensive position. Some unsullied going to the door, spears up while you unsheathed your sword and held it up ready to hit whoever was right outside.</p><p>Grey Worm took out a small knife and held it defensively as well. Ready for a fight. Very carefully an unsullied open the door and one walked through very carefully with their shield up while the rest of you stayed.</p><p>Suddenly the unsullied got on one knee. Your brows furrowed tightly before Daenerys walked trough the door.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You all stood. In a straight line across from the three masters. Who represented the slave cities that were trying to take Meereen.</p><p>&ldquo;Once before I had offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver&rsquo;s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked out to the water. Ships upon ships of all sizes flinging giant balls of fire at the city which had been freed over two years ago.</p><p>&ldquo;We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.&rdquo; Tyrion said flatly with a straight strong posture as he stood in front of the masters.</p><p>&ldquo;The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys Mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys Mo Naklos will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.&rdquo;</p><p>Your brows rose up as you looked at the three men. They honestly believed Daenerys would be the one surrendering today?</p><p>&ldquo;We obviously didn&rsquo;t communicate clearly. We&rsquo;re here to discuss your surrender, not mine.&rdquo; She clarified looking at the men.</p><p>&ldquo;I imagine it&rsquo;s difficult adjusting to the new reality. Your reign in over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My reign has just begun.&rdquo;</p><p>A small smirk spread across your face as a dragon&rsquo;s screech ripped through the air. The masters turned but before they could her third dragon flew above you all. The one you had seen flying over old Valyria. The one who had flew Daenerys out of the arena. The dragon then landed on the old watch tower above you all. </p><p>You looked up at the dragon as he screeched even louder before jumping down next to Daenerys, his head coming up next to her own.</p><p>You watched as the queen climbed onto the back of her dragon and flew off of the cliff with him knocking over the master&rsquo;s soldiers.</p><p>You watched. You watched with a smirk as the other two dragons broke free from their dungeon beneath the pyramid and flew to the ships as well. And an almost satisfied smirk as they set the ships on tire.</p><p>Grey Worm stepped forward and spoke to the master&rsquo;s soldiers in Valyrian. The men placed down their weapons and ran down the hill to the main ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now last time we spoke. We made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.&rdquo; Missandei said</p><p>&ldquo;It always seems a bit abstract, doesn&rsquo;t it, other people dying?&rdquo;</p><p>One of the masters pushed forward another </p><p>&ldquo;Him! He should die&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes him!&rdquo; The other piped in in a worried manner.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not one of us. He&rsquo;s an outsider, lowborn! He does not speak for us.&rdquo; </p><p>Grey Worm and you both walked forward. His hands behind his back while one of your hands rested on the hilt of your sword and the other rested at your side. You both came up to the man they had been pushing forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo; The man pleaded dropping to his knees &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>You pulled out the dagger from your waist and cut through one of the master&rsquo;s throats while Grey Worm cut through the other&rsquo;s. Leaving the one in the middle.</p><p>You and Grey Worm both stepped back without a word while you straightened out the skirt of your dress and fixed the sleeves as well.</p><p>Tyrion stepped forward and placed a hand on the man&rsquo;s shoulder</p><p>&ldquo;Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind them what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You never wanted to see his face again. The little rat who betrayed the Starks for his own glory. Just to prove himself to a father he hadn&rsquo;t seen in years. Not since he was just a child. </p><p>&ldquo;Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height I seem to recall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Last time I saw him, was in dream of me slitting cutting his head off and sewing an octopuses head on his neck.&rdquo; You said bitterly holding onto Lucia&rsquo;s hand tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard you telling Varys that on the ship to Pentos. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf&rsquo;s height thinks he&rsquo;s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf&rsquo;s height.&rdquo;</p><p>Yara and Theon fucking Greyjoy. In front of your very eyes. The moment you had heard of Theon betraying Robb you wanted to kill him. You wanted to kill him four almost five years ago as well when he had made Jon so upset he had come into your quarters angry. You had let Jon rant until someone his head was in your lap and you were singing.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The height of nobility&rsquo; &lsquo;A man of your stature,&rsquo; &lsquo;someone to look up to.&rsquo; You&rsquo;re all making the same five or six jokes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a long time ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was making Jon Snow so angry he came to me almost in tears of rage because of you a &lsquo;long time ago&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Theon looked to you. He didn&rsquo;t seem to really recognize you. But then he did. He looked from you to the little girl who&rsquo;s hand you had a strong grasp on held her doll in her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a long time ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; Tyrion confirmed &ldquo;And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can&rsquo;t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t murder them.&rdquo; You said harshly. &ldquo;He may have wanted to but he never would have. But he did things just as bad I gather. Maybe worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he paid for them.&rdquo; Yara interjected </p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem like it. He&rsquo;s still alive. It was complicated for you, I&rsquo;m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were.&rdquo; Tyrion breathed looking over the young man in front of you. &ldquo;But then, we all live complicated lives, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought us a hundred ships form the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not my claim. Hers.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys looks at Theon questionably, her legs crossed and in what looked to be an awkward position &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fit to rule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At least we can agree on that.&rdquo; You spat with venom laced in your voice so heavily you almost sounded like Joffrey or your mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Has the Iron islands ever had a queen before? No more than Westeros.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Thron from Yara. He would have murdered us if we&rsquo;d stayed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a pity that would have been.&rdquo; You sneered.</p><p>&ldquo;Be nice.&rdquo; Tyrion warned</p><p>&ldquo;Have I stabbed him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m being nice.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys and Tyrion looked at you concerned while Yara gave you a look and Theon just eyes the dark haired little girl who&rsquo;s head was against your hip while she swayed her body in a childlike fashion.</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Tyrion tell me your father was a terrible king. You and I have that in common.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We do.&rdquo; Daenerys said with a little bit of irritation in her voice. &ldquo;And both murdered by a usurper as well. Will their ships be enough?&rdquo; Daenerys asked turning her head to look at Tyrion.</p><p>&ldquo;With the former Masters&rsquo; fleet, possibly. Barley. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.&rdquo;</p><p>Theon nodded &ldquo;There are and Euron is building more. He&rsquo;s going to offer them to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So why shouldn&rsquo;t I wait for him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Iron Fleet isn&rsquo;t all he&rsquo;s bringing. He also wants to give you&mdash; &ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His big cock, I think he said.&rdquo; Yara finished for Theon.</p><p>You found it slightly amusing how some men could hype up something that they know isn&rsquo;t there. It could be there, but they hype it up so much that what they say you know isn&rsquo;t true.</p><p>&ldquo;Euron&rsquo;s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You don&rsquo;t get one without the other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?&rdquo; Daenerys questioned</p><p>&ldquo;I never demand, but I&rsquo;m up for anything, really.&rdquo; Yara said with a small teasing smile.</p><p>&ldquo;He murdered out father and would have murdered us. He&rsquo;ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Seven Kingdoms.&rdquo; Tyrion said more like a statement than a question.</p><p>&ldquo;All of them.&rdquo; Theon confirmed</p><p>You reached down grabbing under Lucia&rsquo;s arms and picked her up resting her against your hip. You hand resting on her bottom to keep her from slipping down.</p><p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t want the seven kingdoms?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you give them back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don&rsquo;t think a woman&rsquo;s fit to rule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reasonable.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> @<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingsholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>&nbsp; @<a href=\"https://veggidinosaurnuggets.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">veggiedinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a> @<a href=\"http://emilielskov.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">emilieskov</a> @kayylluhh <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mip0dTJRUDCmP8XbpMbKNtA\" target=\"_blank\">@honey-honey-boy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBPqJYqesYaCjYq5L6I7eiQ\" target=\"_blank\">@nan-nie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdVJdBYPzXOFB5rnDPVmekw\" target=\"_blank\">@liloefuru</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRvodjYPHYLY96n57ti7zEA\" target=\"_blank\">@mdgrdians</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEwIXFBDzVlkEJv3yfRxR9g\" target=\"_blank\">@misschief1996</a></p></p>",
