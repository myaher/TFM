Harry walked off stage and saw the two girls. </p><p>\u201cAre you ladies doing alright? Enjoying the show?\u201d Harry asked nervously. He didn\u2019t expect to see them sitting down in a corner. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah, this is awesome!\u201d Katie explained since Hannah could barely look Harry in the eye. \u201cBoth of our feet hurt from our heels so we decided to take a seat for a moment. Is the concert over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no! This is the encore, I just like to make them wait a little. Get the fans a little more anxious and a lot more excited,\u201d Harry chuckled, giving them a wink. He took note that Hannah wasn\u2019t really reacting to anything as she seemed to be off in her own world. \u201cBut alright, let me or anyone know if you need anything, alright?\u201d Katie smiled and thanked Harry for everything. \u201cOh and Hannah?\u201d She turned her head to face Harry for the first time since he walked over. \u201cMaybe we can talk after I\u2019m done?\u201d Hannah nodded, still no words, but Harry was always polite and smiled back at her. \u201cAlright ladies, three more songs, and then we\u2019re getting drinks!\u201d Harry exclaimed as he walked away. </p><p>Katie turned to Hannah, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I will be, but I\u2019m definitely going to need another drink.\u201d</p><p><i>Hannah was alone in her apartment bedroom when she finally looked at the track list for Harry\u2019s new album. It had been released at midnight, and Hannah was afraid of it. Afraid of what he may have written about her. Afraid to actually hear him say some of his most intimate thoughts. Afraid to hear him sing about other women. She took a glance at the track listing and saw \u201cSweet Creature\u201d as the fifth song. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a glass of wine for this,\u201d Hannah said to herself. She came back to her room and played the song that meant so much to her. Hearing his voice and remembering when he sang this song for her made her cry. It had only been five months since they had broken up, but the wound still felt as fresh as yesterday. Her heart physically hurt from all the pain. She was still in love with him, and there had been no contact since. </i></p><p><i>An hour passed, and that\u2019s the only song Hannah had listened to. Finally her roommate Daniel came into her room. \u201cAlright, you sad bitch. It\u2019s time to go out and get drunk to forget about this shitty ass man who broke your heart, ok?\u201d He sat down on her bed and shut off her music while she laughed. \u201cYou can be sad tomorrow, but tonight is our last night living together so we are gonna go have fun!\u201d Daniel was Hannah\u2019s very flamboyant best friend whom Hannah had known since high school. </i></p><p><i>He walked straight into her closet and started picking out some outfits to wear. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go to the club in this shitty ass town and drink their shitty yet very cheap drinks. And maybe we will even find you an even hotter man to take home tonight!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Hannah laughed. \u201cOk, I\u2019m down to go out and get drunk with you, but I don\u2019t know about the man part. We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll decide, since honestly this town has some hot men, but not many of them can honestly compare to your ex man. But there\u2019s also plenty of more men back home for us to look at.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s for sure. And it\u2019s always the same boys here, you know?\u201d Daniel poked his head from around the closet door and gave Hannah a knowing look. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTrue, but also I\u2019m tryna get me some too. So we gotta be on the lookout.\u201d Hannah nodded and continued drinking.</i></p><p><i>It was now past midnight, and Hannah was having the time of her life with her friends. But she honestly couldn\u2019t get her mind off Harry, and the amount of alcohol she had ingested was not helping anything. She didn\u2019t like that he put out the song he wrote for her. She took a shot. It made her sad, and it made her heart hurt. She took a shot. It made her mad about the way he broke up with her. She took a shot. How he lied about loving her. She took a shot.</i></p><p><i>As the alcohol was settling into her system, she decided it was time to leave. She didn\u2019t want Daniel to worry, and he was having a great time with his frat brothers so she told him she was walking home with one of their other roommates. But in reality, she just needed some alone time with her thoughts, and the walk back to the apartment was only 10 minutes. </i></p><p><i>She doesn\u2019t remember turning on the song, but suddenly it was playing. Hannah shivered as the broken hearted feeling set in. Her thoughts kept running through her mind. She had so many questions, so much to say to Harry. Next thing she knew she was calling him. </i></p><p><i>Harry was taken back. He never expected to see Hannah\u2019s name show up on his phone ever again after the way he let her go. He was out at a party, celebrating his album release with his friends in LA. His sister had flown in from London for his upcoming performances on </i>The Late Late Show with James Corden<i>. He excused himself to answer Hannah\u2019s call, worried something was wrong. He found a quiet spot outside and answered, \u201cHello?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello, Harry.\u201d Hannah stated sternly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHannah? Are you alright?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m great, I\u2019m drunk! How are you, Harry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He was very cautious about all of this. \u201cI\u2019m alright\u2026.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see you put \u2018Sweet Creature\u2019 on your album.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, um, yeah I did\u2026. You listened my album?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOnly that song so far. I didn\u2019t expect you to do that. I didn\u2019t think you would since,\u201d Hannah paused. \u201cSince you broke up with me.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, um, I still enjoy the song. And I wrote it at a good time in my life. I wanted to share it with the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHa, well it\u00a0</i>was\u00a0<i>a good time! Were you actually falling in love with me when you wrote that song? Or were you just lying to me?\u201d Hannah questioned him, the alcohol in her system giving her a lot of courage.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow much have you had to drink tonight, Hannah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Harry. Answer my question.\u201d Hannah was determined to have all her questions answered.</i><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Harry sighed, rubbing his forehead. \u201cYes, Hannah. Yes, I was falling in love with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That heart-breaking feeling quickly began to settle in again. \u201cYa know, I think you\u2019re a liar. You\u2019ve lied to me. I think you lied to me all through our relationship. If you really loved me, I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve ended it. We talked about marriage and buying a lake house with a boat to take our kids out on. I don\u2019t think you meant any of it.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course I meant it. I meant every word.\u201d Harry paused, talking much quieter than he was before. \u201cI still do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you loved me, you would\u2019ve tried to keep our relationship afloat. But instead you let it drown.\u201d Hannah was getting angrier by the minute, tears rolling down her face. \u201cIf you loved me, we would still be together. If you loved me, we\u2019d be celebrating together right now. But instead I\u2019m hurting.\u201d Hannah\u2019s cries became more audible for Harry to hear through the phone. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHannah\u2026. I\u2026. I\u2014\u201c Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. He regretted breaking up with her, but he didn\u2019t want to fail Hannah more than he already had. That\u2019s why he felt he had to end their relationship.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen you flew all the way out to Michigan. And for what? Just to break my heart that night?\u201d Hannah just cried for a long moment. Harry was paralyzed and couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cI thought we were meant to be. I saw a long future ahead of us. And now all you left me with is your t-shirt and a song professing your love of lies to me.\u201d Hannah let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. \u201cEverything hurts all the time, Harry. It doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d</i></p><p><i>It stung when Hannah brought up his old t-shirt. He almost called her out for what she did with his shirt, but instead he held back, hoping one day she\u2019ll hear his song. He finished the drink he was holding. \u201cHannah, why don\u2019t you go inside and drink some water and get some sleep? You\u2019re going to be very hungover tomorrow.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do. You left me. You can\u2019t tell me what to do anymore.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen why did you\u2014\u201c Harry stopped because he realized this was going to be a never ending circle. He had to find a way to make her hang up, even if it would only hurt her more. \u201cIf you\u2019re only call to yell at me, then I think you should hang up the phone. You need to move on, just like I did.\u201d It hurt Harry to say that, but he knew that this was for the best. He would never be able to be there for Hannah like she needed him to be. And with that, Hannah hung up.</i></p><p>The girls got their drinks from one of the dressing rooms. Hannah could hear \u201cFrom the Dining Table\u201d beginning to play. Katie was talking about something to one of the hairdressers, but Hannah walked away. She needed to see Harry perform this song. She made her way through the crowd. She stood kind of alone off the side, and from Harry\u2019s view, it kind of put a spotlight on her. Knowing she was staring him down as he performed, he was afraid she\u2019d ever talk to him again. It felt that fate had him spot Hannah right before he was about to sing the next line. On cue as it has been for every show, he sang, </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI see it\u2019s written, it\u2019s all over his face</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won\u2019t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call, by the way\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Hannah couldn\u2019t help it, but she began to cry. Harry even felt his eyes fill up with tears as he sang these words. This song was already so emotional for him, but singing it to her face was a completely different feeling. His heart hurt, too. He looked away and interacted more with the crowd. Hannah kept taking big chugs of her vodka lemonade as Harry sang. She wiped her face when he stopped looking at her, hoping he wouldn\u2019t notice she was crying. But he found his way back to her eyes, never breaking contact as he finished the song. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cWoke up the girl who looked just like you</p><p>I almost said your name.</p><p>We\u2019ve haven\u2019t spoke since you went away</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won\u2019t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Hannah watched the rest of show from the back of the stage, out of Harry\u2019s view. As Harry was waving goodbye to all his fans in the crowd, Hannah and Katie found Katie\u2019s younger sister and her friend. They were all excited about the show and Harry. Katie loved the ending of Harry\u2019s show. She too was a little drunk and was raving about him. Hannah smiled and laughed at Katie fangirling over her ex-boyfriend. Backstage Hannah caught of glimpse of Harry after he left the stage. He was hugging his bandmates for a job well done. Suddenly Mitch pointed Harry in Hannah\u2019s direction, and he began walking her way. </p><p>Harry was stopped in his path Hannah as the other girls reached him first. He was giving everyone little secrets about his show, how it felt to perform in front of that many people, and took some pictures with them. \u201cYou guys, help yourself to anything, alright? I\u2019m just gonna say hello to Hannah.\u201d He looked up as he said that and winked at Hannah. He may have broken her heart, but he can still make her heart flutter with the smallest of gestures. </p><p>\u201cSo what did you think?\u201d</p><p>Hannah waited a moment. There was so many ways she could answer this question, but she decided to keep it simple. \u201cYour band was amazing. Your songs were amazing. You were amazing, Harry. You belong up there on stage.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled, \u201cWell thank you, that means a lot. I feel weightless when I\u2019m up there, like nothing else matters except my music. It\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled back at him. \u201cWell you certainly put on quite the show, Mr. Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 um, off topic, but\u2026 do you want to go somewhere more private to talk?\u201d Hannah nodded and stood from her seat to walk over. She wasn\u2019t even sure if she should be alone with Harry, but her body was already moving before she could make up her mind. Unknowingly to the other, they both became very nervous as they walked to Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>Once in the room, Harry refilled Hannah\u2019s drink and made himself his own. Hannah sat on the edge of the black leather couch while Harry sat in the seat directly diagonal from her. You could feel the awkwardness in the room. They both had so much to say to each other, but neither knew where to start. Harry broke the silence, \u201cYou look like you have something you want to say.\u201d<br/><br/></p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Well\u2026 It was just an emotional concert. That\u2019s all. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>Harry reached forward, placing his hand on her left knee. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a big deal to me. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you like that. You know you can talk to me about anything.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sighed, knowing that she\u2019d have to tell me one way or another. Harry was persistent like that. \u201cI noticed you wrote more songs about me than I had originally thought. Really hit some nerves for me.\u201d Hannah admitted. She was scared to continue the conversation, but it was now or never. \u201cIs \u2018Anna\u2019 about me?\u201d</p><p>Harry blushed, he felt like his face became as red as a tomato. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said you wrote it in September of 2016, but we were already dating then. And the lyrics make it sound like you are talking about a girl you barely know&hellip;? I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I wrote it later, but I based it off of how I felt about you when we were first met. Well, no\u2026 um,\u201d Harry\u2019s nerves were catching up to him as he was admitting things he barely tells anyone else, let alone the person he wrote most of his songs about. \u201cThe One Direction concert you came to on Liam\u2019s birthday? That\u2019s what I wrote about. I just knew that day I had to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Interesting\u2026. And \u2018Ever Since New York\u2019? What\u2019s that all about?\u201d Hannah\u2019s anxiety was starting to kick in, unsure of the direction she was pushing the conversation. </p><p>\u201cWell I wrote that song at two different points. I started it when we were going through stuff after you went back to school. Words were being twisted, trust issues.\u201d Hannah got this shivering feeling of sadness again. \u201cI got stuck for a while, but then I saw how happy you looked with all your friends and\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s voice turned into a whisper, \u201cthere was some regret\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>Harry took the biggest breath, afraid of Hannah\u2019s reaction, \u201cThere was some regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hannah truly didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cGot it.\u201d And the awkwardness set in once again. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sipped her drinking, hoping for some liquid courage to help her continue on. \u201cSo, is that why you wrote \u2018From the Dining Table\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed to himself. \u201cYou\u2019re asking all the serious questions, aren\u2019t you? There\u2019s no room for small talk.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shrugged. \u201cI figured it\u2019s now or never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, to answer your question, it is why I wrote it. Turns out you\u2019d call me drunkenly very soon after.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s face was now beat red. \u201cI am so very sorry about that. I was still very upset about our breakup. That song meant a lot to me,\u201d she said, referring to \u201cSweet Creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, it still means a lot to me, too.\u201d Harry softly smiled at Hannah. </p><p>Hannah was shaking. She had been feeling a lot of things this evening. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m so very sorry about the Luke/t-shirt thing. I know you saw him. He needed a shirt, and we were rushing out of my house to get him to the airport. So I just gave it to him, and of course that\u2019s when you magically see him. It meant nothing. He means nothing to me. I\u2019m so sorry that I hurt you.\u201d These words flew out her mouth, almost making it hard to understand as she began to cry.</p><p>Harry quickly grabbed her hand to calm her down. \u201cHan\u2026 Han, it\u2019s quite alright. It\u2019s alright, love,\u201d he said, comforting her. He moved from his chair to sit right next her to wrap his arms around her as she cried into his shoulder. \u201cThank you for explaining. It does mean a lot to me that you said that.\u201d Harry kissed the top of her and held her for a while until she calmed down. \u00a0</p><p>Hannah leaned her head on his shoulder, catching her breath after crying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, love. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d </p><p>She did her 4-7-8 breathing in her head a moment to completely calm down her anxiety. \u201cSo\u2026 how come you\u2019re here? Like besides for your concert. Like why show up to my work? And why invite me backstage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you broke up with me? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Harry cleared his throat before answering to make give himself some more time to answer. He wasn\u2019t ready to tell her that he was still in love with her. Plus, she has a boyfriend so that\u2019ll just ruin everything. \u201cI, uh, just wanted to catch up. Make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d Before he knew it, Harry was caught up in his own thoughts and said them out loud without any realization. \u201cI wanted to look into your pretty hazel eyes. Hear your voice again. Be close to you.\u201d He lightly bopped her nose with his pointer finger, causing her to give a small smile back.</p><p>Hannah sat up completely and slightly moved away from Harry to look him in the eye. She was visibly in shock, not expecting to hear any of that. \u201cWait, what? Be close to me again?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes went big. \u201cDid I just say that out loud?\u201d</p><p>Hannah stood up and began to pace in the dressing room. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say these things to me! Do you know how long it took for me to move on from you? How hard it was for me? I have a boyfriend now!\u201d</p><p>Harry swallowed nervously, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Han. I didn\u2019t mean any of that.\u201d His heart rate picked up. He could feel his heart beating in his chest. \u201cWell, I did mean it. But I didn\u2019t mean to tell you that. Not now at least. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Hannah stood across from a still seated and uncomfortable Harry with her arms folded across her chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing you for all these months. But I promise you that I have not just sitting around waiting for you to come back to me. <i>Oh no.</i>You told me to move on because you already had. So <i>I did</i>. And now you\u2019re telling me all this\u2026 this bullshit?!\u201d Hannah was fuming mad, pacing again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I said those words to you all those months ago. But you were drunk. And I knew that our conversation was going to go in a circle because I felt that I wasn\u2019t good enough for you\u2026. so I wanted you to leave me in the past.\u201d He sighed. \u201cTurns out I was the one who couldn\u2019t leave you in the past.\u201d</p><p>Something inside Hannah was telling her to go back to Harry, but another part of her said that he will only break her heart again. \u201cHarry\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you want me to say. I\u2019m dating Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Harry stood up from the couch and began to slowly walk closer to Hannah. \u201cI know I am saying all of this at the wrong time. I didn\u2019t plan for it to come out this way, if ever.\u201d </p><p>Hannah sighed, unsure what to do. Harry began to move closer to her. Very quickly he was within arm\u2019s length from her, and he did not look like he was stopping any time soon. He began rubbing his hands up and down her arms to attempt to calm her down. He knew he was causing her to stress out. Hannah looked back up only to meet Harry\u2019s stare. It seemed like forever that they just stood like that. Then Hannah noticed Harry\u2019s gaze left her eyes and went to her lips momentarily before making their way back up her face. He began to move in. \u201cJust let me know if you want me to stop\u2026\u201d And before she knew it, he was inches away from her face. He was so close she could smell the whiskey on his breath. Once again, he looked into her eyes, then at her lips, and back up again. Hannah\u2019s breathing picked up, and she froze. She knew this was wrong, but she had missed Harry for so long. His forehead pressed against hers. Then his lips grazed hers, and with no hesitation, he grabbed her hips to pull her closer and kissed her. Hannah froze until she couldn\u2019t anymore. Almost instinctively her arms wrapped around Harry\u2019s neck. It felt like no time had passed between them. There was electricity when they touched, and neither of them wanted this moment to end. </p><p><br/></p><p>*****************************************************************************************************</p><p><b><a href=\"http://shallwedancetogether.tumblr.com/post/176310327778\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b></p>",

Harry walked off stage and saw the two girls. </p><p>\u201cAre you ladies doing alright? Enjoying the show?\u201d Harry asked nervously. He didn\u2019t expect to see them sitting down in a corner. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah, this is awesome!\u201d Katie explained since Hannah could barely look Harry in the eye. \u201cBoth of our feet hurt from our heels so we decided to take a seat for a moment. Is the concert over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no! This is the encore, I just like to make them wait a little. Get the fans a little more anxious and a lot more excited,\u201d Harry chuckled, giving them a wink. He took note that Hannah wasn\u2019t really reacting to anything as she seemed to be off in her own world. \u201cBut alright, let me or anyone know if you need anything, alright?\u201d Katie smiled and thanked Harry for everything. \u201cOh and Hannah?\u201d She turned her head to face Harry for the first time since he walked over. \u201cMaybe we can talk after I\u2019m done?\u201d Hannah nodded, still no words, but Harry was always polite and smiled back at her. \u201cAlright ladies, three more songs, and then we\u2019re getting drinks!\u201d Harry exclaimed as he walked away. </p><p>Katie turned to Hannah, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I will be, but I\u2019m definitely going to need another drink.\u201d</p><p><i>Hannah was alone in her apartment bedroom when she finally looked at the track list for Harry\u2019s new album. It had been released at midnight, and Hannah was afraid of it. Afraid of what he may have written about her. Afraid to actually hear him say some of his most intimate thoughts. Afraid to hear him sing about other women. She took a glance at the track listing and saw \u201cSweet Creature\u201d as the fifth song. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a glass of wine for this,\u201d Hannah said to herself. She came back to her room and played the song that meant so much to her. Hearing his voice and remembering when he sang this song for her made her cry. It had only been five months since they had broken up, but the wound still felt as fresh as yesterday. Her heart physically hurt from all the pain. She was still in love with him, and there had been no contact since. </i></p><p><i>An hour passed, and that\u2019s the only song Hannah had listened to. Finally her roommate Daniel came into her room. \u201cAlright, you sad bitch. It\u2019s time to go out and get drunk to forget about this shitty ass man who broke your heart, ok?\u201d He sat down on her bed and shut off her music while she laughed. \u201cYou can be sad tomorrow, but tonight is our last night living together so we are gonna go have fun!\u201d Daniel was Hannah\u2019s very flamboyant best friend whom Hannah had known since high school. </i></p><p><i>He walked straight into her closet and started picking out some outfits to wear. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go to the club in this shitty ass town and drink their shitty yet very cheap drinks. And maybe we will even find you an even hotter man to take home tonight!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Hannah laughed. \u201cOk, I\u2019m down to go out and get drunk with you, but I don\u2019t know about the man part. We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll decide, since honestly this town has some hot men, but not many of them can honestly compare to your ex man. But there\u2019s also plenty of more men back home for us to look at.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s for sure. And it\u2019s always the same boys here, you know?\u201d Daniel poked his head from around the closet door and gave Hannah a knowing look. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTrue, but also I\u2019m tryna get me some too. So we gotta be on the lookout.\u201d Hannah nodded and continued drinking.</i></p><p><i>It was now past midnight, and Hannah was having the time of her life with her friends. But she honestly couldn\u2019t get her mind off Harry, and the amount of alcohol she had ingested was not helping anything. She didn\u2019t like that he put out the song he wrote for her. She took a shot. It made her sad, and it made her heart hurt. She took a shot. It made her mad about the way he broke up with her. She took a shot. How he lied about loving her. She took a shot.</i></p><p><i>As the alcohol was settling into her system, she decided it was time to leave. She didn\u2019t want Daniel to worry, and he was having a great time with his frat brothers so she told him she was walking home with one of their other roommates. But in reality, she just needed some alone time with her thoughts, and the walk back to the apartment was only 10 minutes. </i></p><p><i>She doesn\u2019t remember turning on the song, but suddenly it was playing. Hannah shivered as the broken hearted feeling set in. Her thoughts kept running through her mind. She had so many questions, so much to say to Harry. Next thing she knew she was calling him. </i></p><p><i>Harry was taken back. He never expected to see Hannah\u2019s name show up on his phone ever again after the way he let her go. He was out at a party, celebrating his album release with his friends in LA. His sister had flown in from London for his upcoming performances on </i>The Late Late Show with James Corden<i>. He excused himself to answer Hannah\u2019s call, worried something was wrong. He found a quiet spot outside and answered, \u201cHello?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello, Harry.\u201d Hannah stated sternly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHannah? Are you alright?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m great, I\u2019m drunk! How are you, Harry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He was very cautious about all of this. \u201cI\u2019m alright\u2026.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see you put \u2018Sweet Creature\u2019 on your album.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, um, yeah I did\u2026. You listened my album?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOnly that song so far. I didn\u2019t expect you to do that. I didn\u2019t think you would since,\u201d Hannah paused. \u201cSince you broke up with me.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, um, I still enjoy the song. And I wrote it at a good time in my life. I wanted to share it with the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHa, well it\u00a0</i>was\u00a0<i>a good time! Were you actually falling in love with me when you wrote that song? Or were you just lying to me?\u201d Hannah questioned him, the alcohol in her system giving her a lot of courage.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow much have you had to drink tonight, Hannah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Harry. Answer my question.\u201d Hannah was determined to have all her questions answered.</i><i><br></i></p><p><i>Harry sighed, rubbing his forehead. \u201cYes, Hannah. Yes, I was falling in love with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That heart-breaking feeling quickly began to settle in again. \u201cYa know, I think you\u2019re a liar. You\u2019ve lied to me. I think you lied to me all through our relationship. If you really loved me, I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve ended it. We talked about marriage and buying a lake house with a boat to take our kids out on. I don\u2019t think you meant any of it.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course I meant it. I meant every word.\u201d Harry paused, talking much quieter than he was before. \u201cI still do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you loved me, you would\u2019ve tried to keep our relationship afloat. But instead you let it drown.\u201d Hannah was getting angrier by the minute, tears rolling down her face. \u201cIf you loved me, we would still be together. If you loved me, we\u2019d be celebrating together right now. But instead I\u2019m hurting.\u201d Hannah\u2019s cries became more audible for Harry to hear through the phone. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHannah\u2026. I\u2026. I\u2014\u201c Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. He regretted breaking up with her, but he didn\u2019t want to fail Hannah more than he already had. That\u2019s why he felt he had to end their relationship.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen you flew all the way out to Michigan. And for what? Just to break my heart that night?\u201d Hannah just cried for a long moment. Harry was paralyzed and couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cI thought we were meant to be. I saw a long future ahead of us. And now all you left me with is your t-shirt and a song professing your love of lies to me.\u201d Hannah let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. \u201cEverything hurts all the time, Harry. It doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d</i></p><p><i>It stung when Hannah brought up his old t-shirt. He almost called her out for what she did with his shirt, but instead he held back, hoping one day she\u2019ll hear his song. He finished the drink he was holding. \u201cHannah, why don\u2019t you go inside and drink some water and get some sleep? You\u2019re going to be very hungover tomorrow.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do. You left me. You can\u2019t tell me what to do anymore.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen why did you\u2014\u201c Harry stopped because he realized this was going to be a never ending circle. He had to find a way to make her hang up, even if it would only hurt her more. \u201cIf you\u2019re only call to yell at me, then I think you should hang up the phone. You need to move on, just like I did.\u201d It hurt Harry to say that, but he knew that this was for the best. He would never be able to be there for Hannah like she needed him to be. And with that, Hannah hung up.</i></p><p>The girls got their drinks from one of the dressing rooms. Hannah could hear \u201cFrom the Dining Table\u201d beginning to play. Katie was talking about something to one of the hairdressers, but Hannah walked away. She needed to see Harry perform this song. She made her way through the crowd. She stood kind of alone off the side, and from Harry\u2019s view, it kind of put a spotlight on her. Knowing she was staring him down as he performed, he was afraid she\u2019d ever talk to him again. It felt that fate had him spot Hannah right before he was about to sing the next line. On cue as it has been for every show, he sang, </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI see it\u2019s written, it\u2019s all over his face</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won\u2019t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call, by the way\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Hannah couldn\u2019t help it, but she began to cry. Harry even felt his eyes fill up with tears as he sang these words. This song was already so emotional for him, but singing it to her face was a completely different feeling. His heart hurt, too. He looked away and interacted more with the crowd. Hannah kept taking big chugs of her vodka lemonade as Harry sang. She wiped her face when he stopped looking at her, hoping he wouldn\u2019t notice she was crying. But he found his way back to her eyes, never breaking contact as he finished the song. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cWoke up the girl who looked just like you</p><p>I almost said your name.</p><p>We\u2019ve haven\u2019t spoke since you went away</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won\u2019t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Hannah watched the rest of show from the back of the stage, out of Harry\u2019s view. As Harry was waving goodbye to all his fans in the crowd, Hannah and Katie found Katie\u2019s younger sister and her friend. They were all excited about the show and Harry. Katie loved the ending of Harry\u2019s show. She too was a little drunk and was raving about him. Hannah smiled and laughed at Katie fangirling over her ex-boyfriend. Backstage Hannah caught of glimpse of Harry after he left the stage. He was hugging his bandmates for a job well done. Suddenly Mitch pointed Harry in Hannah\u2019s direction, and he began walking her way. </p><p>Harry was stopped in his path Hannah as the other girls reached him first. He was giving everyone little secrets about his show, how it felt to perform in front of that many people, and took some pictures with them. \u201cYou guys, help yourself to anything, alright? I\u2019m just gonna say hello to Hannah.\u201d He looked up as he said that and winked at Hannah. He may have broken her heart, but he can still make her heart flutter with the smallest of gestures. </p><p>\u201cSo what did you think?\u201d</p><p>Hannah waited a moment. There was so many ways she could answer this question, but she decided to keep it simple. \u201cYour band was amazing. Your songs were amazing. You were amazing, Harry. You belong up there on stage.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled, \u201cWell thank you, that means a lot. I feel weightless when I\u2019m up there, like nothing else matters except my music. It\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled back at him. \u201cWell you certainly put on quite the show, Mr. Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 um, off topic, but\u2026 do you want to go somewhere more private to talk?\u201d Hannah nodded and stood from her seat to walk over. She wasn\u2019t even sure if she should be alone with Harry, but her body was already moving before she could make up her mind. Unknowingly to the other, they both became very nervous as they walked to Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>Once in the room, Harry refilled Hannah\u2019s drink and made himself his own. Hannah sat on the edge of the black leather couch while Harry sat in the seat directly diagonal from her. You could feel the awkwardness in the room. They both had so much to say to each other, but neither knew where to start. Harry broke the silence, \u201cYou look like you have something you want to say.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Well\u2026 It was just an emotional concert. That\u2019s all. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>Harry reached forward, placing his hand on her left knee. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a big deal to me. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you like that. You know you can talk to me about anything.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sighed, knowing that she\u2019d have to tell me one way or another. Harry was persistent like that. \u201cI noticed you wrote more songs about me than I had originally thought. Really hit some nerves for me.\u201d Hannah admitted. She was scared to continue the conversation, but it was now or never. \u201cIs \u2018Anna\u2019 about me?\u201d</p><p>Harry blushed, he felt like his face became as red as a tomato. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said you wrote it in September of 2016, but we were already dating then. And the lyrics make it sound like you are talking about a girl you barely know\u2026? I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I wrote it later, but I based it off of how I felt about you when we were first met. Well, no\u2026 um,\u201d Harry\u2019s nerves were catching up to him as he was admitting things he barely tells anyone else, let alone the person he wrote most of his songs about. \u201cThe One Direction concert you came to on Liam\u2019s birthday? That\u2019s what I wrote about. I just knew that day I had to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Interesting\u2026. And \u2018Ever Since New York\u2019? What\u2019s that all about?\u201d Hannah\u2019s anxiety was starting to kick in, unsure of the direction she was pushing the conversation. </p><p>\u201cWell I wrote that song at two different points. I started it when we were going through stuff after you went back to school. Words were being twisted, trust issues.\u201d Hannah got this shivering feeling of sadness again. \u201cI got stuck for a while, but then I saw how happy you looked with all your friends and\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s voice turned into a whisper, \u201cthere was some regret\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>Harry took the biggest breath, afraid of Hannah\u2019s reaction, \u201cThere was some regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hannah truly didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cGot it.\u201d And the awkwardness set in once again. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sipped her drinking, hoping for some liquid courage to help her continue on. \u201cSo, is that why you wrote \u2018From the Dining Table\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed to himself. \u201cYou\u2019re asking all the serious questions, aren\u2019t you? There\u2019s no room for small talk.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shrugged. \u201cI figured it\u2019s now or never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, to answer your question, it is why I wrote it. Turns out you\u2019d call me drunkenly very soon after.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s face was now beat red. \u201cI am so very sorry about that. I was still very upset about our breakup. That song meant a lot to me,\u201d she said, referring to \u201cSweet Creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, it still means a lot to me, too.\u201d Harry softly smiled at Hannah. </p><p>Hannah was shaking. She had been feeling a lot of things this evening. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m so very sorry about the Luke/t-shirt thing. I know you saw him. He needed a shirt, and we were rushing out of my house to get him to the airport. So I just gave it to him, and of course that\u2019s when you magically see him. It meant nothing. He means nothing to me. I\u2019m so sorry that I hurt you.\u201d These words flew out her mouth, almost making it hard to understand as she began to cry.</p><p>Harry quickly grabbed her hand to calm her down. \u201cHan\u2026 Han, it\u2019s quite alright. It\u2019s alright, love,\u201d he said, comforting her. He moved from his chair to sit right next her to wrap his arms around her as she cried into his shoulder. \u201cThank you for explaining. It does mean a lot to me that you said that.\u201d Harry kissed the top of her and held her for a while until she calmed down. \u00a0</p><p>Hannah leaned her head on his shoulder, catching her breath after crying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, love. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d </p><p>She did her 4-7-8 breathing in her head a moment to completely calm down her anxiety. \u201cSo\u2026 how come you\u2019re here? Like besides for your concert. Like why show up to my work? And why invite me backstage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you broke up with me? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Harry cleared his throat before answering to make give himself some more time to answer. He wasn\u2019t ready to tell her that he was still in love with her. Plus, she has a boyfriend so that\u2019ll just ruin everything. \u201cI, uh, just wanted to catch up. Make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d Before he knew it, Harry was caught up in his own thoughts and said them out loud without any realization. \u201cI wanted to look into your pretty hazel eyes. Hear your voice again. Be close to you.\u201d He lightly bopped her nose with his pointer finger, causing her to give a small smile back.</p><p>Hannah sat up completely and slightly moved away from Harry to look him in the eye. She was visibly in shock, not expecting to hear any of that. \u201cWait, what? Be close to me again?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes went big. \u201cDid I just say that out loud?\u201d</p><p>Hannah stood up and began to pace in the dressing room. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say these things to me! Do you know how long it took for me to move on from you? How hard it was for me? I have a boyfriend now!\u201d</p><p>Harry swallowed nervously, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Han. I didn\u2019t mean any of that.\u201d His heart rate picked up. He could feel his heart beating in his chest. \u201cWell, I did mean it. But I didn\u2019t mean to tell you that. Not now at least. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Hannah stood across from a still seated and uncomfortable Harry with her arms folded across her chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing you for all these months. But I promise you that I have not just sitting around waiting for you to come back to me. <i>Oh no.</i>You told me to move on because you already had. So <i>I did</i>. And now you\u2019re telling me all this\u2026 this bullshit?!\u201d Hannah was fuming mad, pacing again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I said those words to you all those months ago. But you were drunk. And I knew that our conversation was going to go in a circle because I felt that I wasn\u2019t good enough for you\u2026. so I wanted you to leave me in the past.\u201d He sighed. \u201cTurns out I was the one who couldn\u2019t leave you in the past.\u201d</p><p>Something inside Hannah was telling her to go back to Harry, but another part of her said that he will only break her heart again. \u201cHarry\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you want me to say. I\u2019m dating Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Harry stood up from the couch and began to slowly walk closer to Hannah. \u201cI know I am saying all of this at the wrong time. I didn\u2019t plan for it to come out this way, if ever.\u201d </p><p>Hannah sighed, unsure what to do. Harry began to move closer to her. Very quickly he was within arm\u2019s length from her, and he did not look like he was stopping any time soon. He began rubbing his hands up and down her arms to attempt to calm her down. He knew he was causing her to stress out. Hannah looked back up only to meet Harry\u2019s stare. It seemed like forever that they just stood like that. Then Hannah noticed Harry\u2019s gaze left her eyes and went to her lips momentarily before making their way back up her face. He began to move in. \u201cJust let me know if you want me to stop\u2026\u201d And before she knew it, he was inches away from her face. He was so close she could smell the whiskey on his breath. Once again, he looked into her eyes, then at her lips, and back up again. Hannah\u2019s breathing picked up, and she froze. She knew this was wrong, but she had missed Harry for so long. His forehead pressed against hers. Then his lips grazed hers, and with no hesitation, he grabbed her hips to pull her closer and kissed her. Hannah froze until she couldn\u2019t anymore. Almost instinctively her arms wrapped around Harry\u2019s neck. It felt like no time had passed between them. There was electricity when they touched, and neither of them wanted this moment to end. </p><p><br></p><p>*****************************************************************************************************</p><p><b><a href=\"http://shallwedancetogether.tumblr.com/post/176310327778\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b></p></p>",

Harry walked off stage and saw the two girls. </p><p>\u201cAre you ladies doing alright? Enjoying the show?\u201d Harry asked nervously. He didn\u2019t expect to see them sitting down in a corner. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah, this is awesome!\u201d Katie explained since Hannah could barely look Harry in the eye. \u201cBoth of our feet hurt from our heels so we decided to take a seat for a moment. Is the concert over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no! This is the encore, I just like to make them wait a little. Get the fans a little more anxious and a lot more excited,\u201d Harry chuckled, giving them a wink. He took note that Hannah wasn\u2019t really reacting to anything as she seemed to be off in her own world. \u201cBut alright, let me or anyone know if you need anything, alright?\u201d Katie smiled and thanked Harry for everything. \u201cOh and Hannah?\u201d She turned her head to face Harry for the first time since he walked over. \u201cMaybe we can talk after I\u2019m done?\u201d Hannah nodded, still no words, but Harry was always polite and smiled back at her. \u201cAlright ladies, three more songs, and then we\u2019re getting drinks!\u201d Harry exclaimed as he walked away. </p><p>Katie turned to Hannah, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re feeling alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I will be, but I\u2019m definitely going to need another drink.\u201d</p><p><i>Hannah was alone in her apartment bedroom when she finally looked at the track list for Harry\u2019s new album. It had been released at midnight, and Hannah was afraid of it. Afraid of what he may have written about her. Afraid to actually hear him say some of his most intimate thoughts. Afraid to hear him sing about other women. She took a glance at the track listing and saw \u201cSweet Creature\u201d as the fifth song. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a glass of wine for this,\u201d Hannah said to herself. She came back to her room and played the song that meant so much to her. Hearing his voice and remembering when he sang this song for her made her cry. It had only been five months since they had broken up, but the wound still felt as fresh as yesterday. Her heart physically hurt from all the pain. She was still in love with him, and there had been no contact since. </i></p><p><i>An hour passed, and that\u2019s the only song Hannah had listened to. Finally her roommate Daniel came into her room. \u201cAlright, you sad bitch. It\u2019s time to go out and get drunk to forget about this shitty ass man who broke your heart, ok?\u201d He sat down on her bed and shut off her music while she laughed. \u201cYou can be sad tomorrow, but tonight is our last night living together so we are gonna go have fun!\u201d Daniel was Hannah\u2019s very flamboyant best friend whom Hannah had known since high school. </i></p><p><i>He walked straight into her closet and started picking out some outfits to wear. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go to the club in this shitty ass town and drink their shitty yet very cheap drinks. And maybe we will even find you an even hotter man to take home tonight!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Hannah laughed. \u201cOk, I\u2019m down to go out and get drunk with you, but I don\u2019t know about the man part. We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll decide, since honestly this town has some hot men, but not many of them can honestly compare to your ex man. But there\u2019s also plenty of more men back home for us to look at.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s for sure. And it\u2019s always the same boys here, you know?\u201d Daniel poked his head from around the closet door and gave Hannah a knowing look. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTrue, but also I\u2019m tryna get me some too. So we gotta be on the lookout.\u201d Hannah nodded and continued drinking.</i></p><p><i>It was now past midnight, and Hannah was having the time of her life with her friends. But she honestly couldn\u2019t get her mind off Harry, and the amount of alcohol she had ingested was not helping anything. She didn\u2019t like that he put out the song he wrote for her. She took a shot. It made her sad, and it made her heart hurt. She took a shot. It made her mad about the way he broke up with her. She took a shot. How he lied about loving her. She took a shot.</i></p><p><i>As the alcohol was settling into her system, she decided it was time to leave. She didn\u2019t want Daniel to worry, and he was having a great time with his frat brothers so she told him she was walking home with one of their other roommates. But in reality, she just needed some alone time with her thoughts, and the walk back to the apartment was only 10 minutes. </i></p><p><i>She doesn\u2019t remember turning on the song, but suddenly it was playing. Hannah shivered as the broken hearted feeling set in. Her thoughts kept running through her mind. She had so many questions, so much to say to Harry. Next thing she knew she was calling him. </i></p><p><i>Harry was taken back. He never expected to see Hannah\u2019s name show up on his phone ever again after the way he let her go. He was out at a party, celebrating his album release with his friends in LA. His sister had flown in from London for his upcoming performances on </i>The Late Late Show with James Corden<i>. He excused himself to answer Hannah\u2019s call, worried something was wrong. He found a quiet spot outside and answered, \u201cHello?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHello, Harry.\u201d Hannah stated sternly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHannah? Are you alright?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m great, I\u2019m drunk! How are you, Harry?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He was very cautious about all of this. \u201cI\u2019m alright\u2026.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see you put \u2018Sweet Creature\u2019 on your album.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, um, yeah I did\u2026. You listened my album?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOnly that song so far. I didn\u2019t expect you to do that. I didn\u2019t think you would since,\u201d Hannah paused. \u201cSince you broke up with me.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, um, I still enjoy the song. And I wrote it at a good time in my life. I wanted to share it with the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHa, well it\u00a0</i>was\u00a0<i>a good time! Were you actually falling in love with me when you wrote that song? Or were you just lying to me?\u201d Hannah questioned him, the alcohol in her system giving her a lot of courage.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow much have you had to drink tonight, Hannah?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Harry. Answer my question.\u201d Hannah was determined to have all her questions answered.</i><i><br></i></p><p><i>Harry sighed, rubbing his forehead. \u201cYes, Hannah. Yes, I was falling in love with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>That heart-breaking feeling quickly began to settle in again. \u201cYa know, I think you\u2019re a liar. You\u2019ve lied to me. I think you lied to me all through our relationship. If you really loved me, I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve ended it. We talked about marriage and buying a lake house with a boat to take our kids out on. I don\u2019t think you meant any of it.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course I meant it. I meant every word.\u201d Harry paused, talking much quieter than he was before. \u201cI still do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you loved me, you would\u2019ve tried to keep our relationship afloat. But instead you let it drown.\u201d Hannah was getting angrier by the minute, tears rolling down her face. \u201cIf you loved me, we would still be together. If you loved me, we\u2019d be celebrating together right now. But instead I\u2019m hurting.\u201d Hannah\u2019s cries became more audible for Harry to hear through the phone. </i></p><p><i>\u201cHannah\u2026. I\u2026. I\u2014\u201c Harry didn\u2019t know what to say. He regretted breaking up with her, but he didn\u2019t want to fail Hannah more than he already had. That\u2019s why he felt he had to end their relationship.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen you flew all the way out to Michigan. And for what? Just to break my heart that night?\u201d Hannah just cried for a long moment. Harry was paralyzed and couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cI thought we were meant to be. I saw a long future ahead of us. And now all you left me with is your t-shirt and a song professing your love of lies to me.\u201d Hannah let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. \u201cEverything hurts all the time, Harry. It doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d</i></p><p><i>It stung when Hannah brought up his old t-shirt. He almost called her out for what she did with his shirt, but instead he held back, hoping one day she\u2019ll hear his song. He finished the drink he was holding. \u201cHannah, why don\u2019t you go inside and drink some water and get some sleep? You\u2019re going to be very hungover tomorrow.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do. You left me. You can\u2019t tell me what to do anymore.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen why did you\u2014\u201c Harry stopped because he realized this was going to be a never ending circle. He had to find a way to make her hang up, even if it would only hurt her more. \u201cIf you\u2019re only call to yell at me, then I think you should hang up the phone. You need to move on, just like I did.\u201d It hurt Harry to say that, but he knew that this was for the best. He would never be able to be there for Hannah like she needed him to be. And with that, Hannah hung up.</i></p><p>The girls got their drinks from one of the dressing rooms. Hannah could hear \u201cFrom the Dining Table\u201d beginning to play. Katie was talking about something to one of the hairdressers, but Hannah walked away. She needed to see Harry perform this song. She made her way through the crowd. She stood kind of alone off the side, and from Harry\u2019s view, it kind of put a spotlight on her. Knowing she was staring him down as he performed, he was afraid she\u2019d ever talk to him again. It felt that fate had him spot Hannah right before he was about to sing the next line. On cue as it has been for every show, he sang, </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI see it\u2019s written, it\u2019s all over his face</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won\u2019t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call, by the way\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Hannah couldn\u2019t help it, but she began to cry. Harry even felt his eyes fill up with tears as he sang these words. This song was already so emotional for him, but singing it to her face was a completely different feeling. His heart hurt, too. He looked away and interacted more with the crowd. Hannah kept taking big chugs of her vodka lemonade as Harry sang. She wiped her face when he stopped looking at her, hoping he wouldn\u2019t notice she was crying. But he found his way back to her eyes, never breaking contact as he finished the song. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cWoke up the girl who looked just like you</p><p>I almost said your name.</p><p>We\u2019ve haven\u2019t spoke since you went away</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won\u2019t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Hannah watched the rest of show from the back of the stage, out of Harry\u2019s view. As Harry was waving goodbye to all his fans in the crowd, Hannah and Katie found Katie\u2019s younger sister and her friend. They were all excited about the show and Harry. Katie loved the ending of Harry\u2019s show. She too was a little drunk and was raving about him. Hannah smiled and laughed at Katie fangirling over her ex-boyfriend. Backstage Hannah caught of glimpse of Harry after he left the stage. He was hugging his bandmates for a job well done. Suddenly Mitch pointed Harry in Hannah\u2019s direction, and he began walking her way. </p><p>Harry was stopped in his path Hannah as the other girls reached him first. He was giving everyone little secrets about his show, how it felt to perform in front of that many people, and took some pictures with them. \u201cYou guys, help yourself to anything, alright? I\u2019m just gonna say hello to Hannah.\u201d He looked up as he said that and winked at Hannah. He may have broken her heart, but he can still make her heart flutter with the smallest of gestures. </p><p>\u201cSo what did you think?\u201d</p><p>Hannah waited a moment. There was so many ways she could answer this question, but she decided to keep it simple. \u201cYour band was amazing. Your songs were amazing. You were amazing, Harry. You belong up there on stage.\u201d</p><p>Harry chuckled, \u201cWell thank you, that means a lot. I feel weightless when I\u2019m up there, like nothing else matters except my music. It\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d</p><p>Hannah smiled back at him. \u201cWell you certainly put on quite the show, Mr. Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 um, off topic, but\u2026 do you want to go somewhere more private to talk?\u201d Hannah nodded and stood from her seat to walk over. She wasn\u2019t even sure if she should be alone with Harry, but her body was already moving before she could make up her mind. Unknowingly to the other, they both became very nervous as they walked to Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>Once in the room, Harry refilled Hannah\u2019s drink and made himself his own. Hannah sat on the edge of the black leather couch while Harry sat in the seat directly diagonal from her. You could feel the awkwardness in the room. They both had so much to say to each other, but neither knew where to start. Harry broke the silence, \u201cYou look like you have something you want to say.\u201d<br><br></p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Well\u2026 It was just an emotional concert. That\u2019s all. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>Harry reached forward, placing his hand on her left knee. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a big deal to me. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you like that. You know you can talk to me about anything.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sighed, knowing that she\u2019d have to tell me one way or another. Harry was persistent like that. \u201cI noticed you wrote more songs about me than I had originally thought. Really hit some nerves for me.\u201d Hannah admitted. She was scared to continue the conversation, but it was now or never. \u201cIs \u2018Anna\u2019 about me?\u201d</p><p>Harry blushed, he felt like his face became as red as a tomato. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said you wrote it in September of 2016, but we were already dating then. And the lyrics make it sound like you are talking about a girl you barely know\u2026? I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I wrote it later, but I based it off of how I felt about you when we were first met. Well, no\u2026 um,\u201d Harry\u2019s nerves were catching up to him as he was admitting things he barely tells anyone else, let alone the person he wrote most of his songs about. \u201cThe One Direction concert you came to on Liam\u2019s birthday? That\u2019s what I wrote about. I just knew that day I had to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Interesting\u2026. And \u2018Ever Since New York\u2019? What\u2019s that all about?\u201d Hannah\u2019s anxiety was starting to kick in, unsure of the direction she was pushing the conversation. </p><p>\u201cWell I wrote that song at two different points. I started it when we were going through stuff after you went back to school. Words were being twisted, trust issues.\u201d Hannah got this shivering feeling of sadness again. \u201cI got stuck for a while, but then I saw how happy you looked with all your friends and\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d Harry\u2019s voice turned into a whisper, \u201cthere was some regret\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>Harry took the biggest breath, afraid of Hannah\u2019s reaction, \u201cThere was some regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hannah truly didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cGot it.\u201d And the awkwardness set in once again. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sipped her drinking, hoping for some liquid courage to help her continue on. \u201cSo, is that why you wrote \u2018From the Dining Table\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed to himself. \u201cYou\u2019re asking all the serious questions, aren\u2019t you? There\u2019s no room for small talk.\u201d</p><p>Hannah shrugged. \u201cI figured it\u2019s now or never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, to answer your question, it is why I wrote it. Turns out you\u2019d call me drunkenly very soon after.\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s face was now beat red. \u201cI am so very sorry about that. I was still very upset about our breakup. That song meant a lot to me,\u201d she said, referring to \u201cSweet Creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, it still means a lot to me, too.\u201d Harry softly smiled at Hannah. </p><p>Hannah was shaking. She had been feeling a lot of things this evening. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m so very sorry about the Luke/t-shirt thing. I know you saw him. He needed a shirt, and we were rushing out of my house to get him to the airport. So I just gave it to him, and of course that\u2019s when you magically see him. It meant nothing. He means nothing to me. I\u2019m so sorry that I hurt you.\u201d These words flew out her mouth, almost making it hard to understand as she began to cry.</p><p>Harry quickly grabbed her hand to calm her down. \u201cHan\u2026 Han, it\u2019s quite alright. It\u2019s alright, love,\u201d he said, comforting her. He moved from his chair to sit right next her to wrap his arms around her as she cried into his shoulder. \u201cThank you for explaining. It does mean a lot to me that you said that.\u201d Harry kissed the top of her and held her for a while until she calmed down. \u00a0</p><p>Hannah leaned her head on his shoulder, catching her breath after crying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, love. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d </p><p>She did her 4-7-8 breathing in her head a moment to completely calm down her anxiety. \u201cSo\u2026 how come you\u2019re here? Like besides for your concert. Like why show up to my work? And why invite me backstage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you broke up with me? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Harry cleared his throat before answering to make give himself some more time to answer. He wasn\u2019t ready to tell her that he was still in love with her. Plus, she has a boyfriend so that\u2019ll just ruin everything. \u201cI, uh, just wanted to catch up. Make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d Before he knew it, Harry was caught up in his own thoughts and said them out loud without any realization. \u201cI wanted to look into your pretty hazel eyes. Hear your voice again. Be close to you.\u201d He lightly bopped her nose with his pointer finger, causing her to give a small smile back.</p><p>Hannah sat up completely and slightly moved away from Harry to look him in the eye. She was visibly in shock, not expecting to hear any of that. \u201cWait, what? Be close to me again?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes went big. \u201cDid I just say that out loud?\u201d</p><p>Hannah stood up and began to pace in the dressing room. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say these things to me! Do you know how long it took for me to move on from you? How hard it was for me? I have a boyfriend now!\u201d</p><p>Harry swallowed nervously, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Han. I didn\u2019t mean any of that.\u201d His heart rate picked up. He could feel his heart beating in his chest. \u201cWell, I did mean it. But I didn\u2019t mean to tell you that. Not now at least. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Hannah stood across from a still seated and uncomfortable Harry with her arms folded across her chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing you for all these months. But I promise you that I have not just sitting around waiting for you to come back to me. <i>Oh no.</i>You told me to move on because you already had. So <i>I did</i>. And now you\u2019re telling me all this\u2026 this bullshit?!\u201d Hannah was fuming mad, pacing again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I said those words to you all those months ago. But you were drunk. And I knew that our conversation was going to go in a circle because I felt that I wasn\u2019t good enough for you\u2026. so I wanted you to leave me in the past.\u201d He sighed. \u201cTurns out I was the one who couldn\u2019t leave you in the past.\u201d</p><p>Something inside Hannah was telling her to go back to Harry, but another part of her said that he will only break her heart again. \u201cHarry\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you want me to say. I\u2019m dating Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Harry stood up from the couch and began to slowly walk closer to Hannah. \u201cI know I am saying all of this at the wrong time. I didn\u2019t plan for it to come out this way, if ever.\u201d </p><p>Hannah sighed, unsure what to do. Harry began to move closer to her. Very quickly he was within arm\u2019s length from her, and he did not look like he was stopping any time soon. He began rubbing his hands up and down her arms to attempt to calm her down. He knew he was causing her to stress out. Hannah looked back up only to meet Harry\u2019s stare. It seemed like forever that they just stood like that. Then Hannah noticed Harry\u2019s gaze left her eyes and went to her lips momentarily before making their way back up her face. He began to move in. \u201cJust let me know if you want me to stop\u2026\u201d And before she knew it, he was inches away from her face. He was so close she could smell the whiskey on his breath. Once again, he looked into her eyes, then at her lips, and back up again. Hannah\u2019s breathing picked up, and she froze. She knew this was wrong, but she had missed Harry for so long. His forehead pressed against hers. Then his lips grazed hers, and with no hesitation, he grabbed her hips to pull her closer and kissed her. Hannah froze until she couldn\u2019t anymore. Almost instinctively her arms wrapped around Harry\u2019s neck. It felt like no time had passed between them. There was electricity when they touched, and neither of them wanted this moment to end. </p><p><br></p><p>*****************************************************************************************************</p><p><b><a href=\"http://shallwedancetogether.tumblr.com/post/176310327778\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2><b>Chapter Six</b></h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p>Hannah and Katie stayed seated at the back side of the stage, still watching the concert, Hannah had never felt so nervous; she felt as if she could throw up. Harry walked off stage and saw the two girls. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ladies doing alright? Enjoying the show?&rdquo; Harry asked nervously. He didn&rsquo;t expect to see them sitting down in a corner. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, this is awesome!&rdquo; Katie explained since Hannah could barely look Harry in the eye. &ldquo;Both of our feet hurt from our heels so we decided to take a seat for a moment. Is the concert over?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no! This is the encore, I just like to make them wait a little. Get the fans a little more anxious and a lot more excited,&rdquo; Harry chuckled, giving them a wink. He took note that Hannah wasn&rsquo;t really reacting to anything as she seemed to be off in her own world. &ldquo;But alright, let me or anyone know if you need anything, alright?&rdquo; Katie smiled and thanked Harry for everything. &ldquo;Oh and Hannah?&rdquo; She turned her head to face Harry for the first time since he walked over. &ldquo;Maybe we can talk after I&rsquo;m done?&rdquo; Hannah nodded, still no words, but Harry was always polite and smiled back at her. &ldquo;Alright ladies, three more songs, and then we&rsquo;re getting drinks!&rdquo; Harry exclaimed as he walked away. </p><p>Katie turned to Hannah, &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re feeling alright?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think I will be, but I&rsquo;m definitely going to need another drink.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Hannah was alone in her apartment bedroom when she finally looked at the track list for Harry&rsquo;s new album. It had been released at midnight, and Hannah was afraid of it. Afraid of what he may have written about her. Afraid to actually hear him say some of his most intimate thoughts. Afraid to hear him sing about other women. She took a glance at the track listing and saw &ldquo;Sweet Creature&rdquo; as the fifth song. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna need a glass of wine for this,&rdquo; Hannah said to herself. She came back to her room and played the song that meant so much to her. Hearing his voice and remembering when he sang this song for her made her cry. It had only been five months since they had broken up, but the wound still felt as fresh as yesterday. Her heart physically hurt from all the pain. She was still in love with him, and there had been no contact since. </i></p><p><i>An hour passed, and that&rsquo;s the only song Hannah had listened to. Finally her roommate Daniel came into her room. &ldquo;Alright, you sad bitch. It&rsquo;s time to go out and get drunk to forget about this shitty ass man who broke your heart, ok?&rdquo; He sat down on her bed and shut off her music while she laughed. &ldquo;You can be sad tomorrow, but tonight is our last night living together so we are gonna go have fun!&rdquo; Daniel was Hannah&rsquo;s very flamboyant best friend whom Hannah had known since high school. </i></p><p><i>He walked straight into her closet and started picking out some outfits to wear. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna go to the club in this shitty ass town and drink their shitty yet very cheap drinks. And maybe we will even find you an even hotter man to take home tonight!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Hannah laughed. &ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;m down to go out and get drunk with you, but I don&rsquo;t know about the man part. We&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe. I&rsquo;ll decide, since honestly this town has some hot men, but not many of them can honestly compare to your ex man. But there&rsquo;s also plenty of more men back home for us to look at.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s for sure. And it&rsquo;s always the same boys here, you know?&rdquo; Daniel poked his head from around the closet door and gave Hannah a knowing look. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;True, but also I&rsquo;m tryna get me some too. So we gotta be on the lookout.&rdquo; Hannah nodded and continued drinking.</i></p><p><i>It was now past midnight, and Hannah was having the time of her life with her friends. But she honestly couldn&rsquo;t get her mind off Harry, and the amount of alcohol she had ingested was not helping anything. She didn&rsquo;t like that he put out the song he wrote for her. She took a shot. It made her sad, and it made her heart hurt. She took a shot. It made her mad about the way he broke up with her. She took a shot. How he lied about loving her. She took a shot.</i></p><p><i>As the alcohol was settling into her system, she decided it was time to leave. She didn&rsquo;t want Daniel to worry, and he was having a great time with his frat brothers so she told him she was walking home with one of their other roommates. But in reality, she just needed some alone time with her thoughts, and the walk back to the apartment was only 10 minutes. </i></p><p><i>She doesn&rsquo;t remember turning on the song, but suddenly it was playing. Hannah shivered as the broken hearted feeling set in. Her thoughts kept running through her mind. She had so many questions, so much to say to Harry. Next thing she knew she was calling him. </i></p><p><i>Harry was taken back. He never expected to see Hannah&rsquo;s name show up on his phone ever again after the way he let her go. He was out at a party, celebrating his album release with his friends in LA. His sister had flown in from London for his upcoming performances on </i>The Late Late Show with James Corden<i>. He excused himself to answer Hannah&rsquo;s call, worried something was wrong. He found a quiet spot outside and answered, &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hello, Harry.&rdquo; Hannah stated sternly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hannah? Are you alright?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m great, I&rsquo;m drunk! How are you, Harry?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He was very cautious about all of this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright&hellip;.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see you put &lsquo;Sweet Creature&rsquo; on your album.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, um, yeah I did&hellip;. You listened my album?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Only that song so far. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to do that. I didn&rsquo;t think you would since,&rdquo; Hannah paused. &ldquo;Since you broke up with me.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, um, I still enjoy the song. And I wrote it at a good time in my life. I wanted to share it with the world.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ha, well it&nbsp;</i>was&nbsp;<i>a good time! Were you actually falling in love with me when you wrote that song? Or were you just lying to me?&rdquo; Hannah questioned him, the alcohol in her system giving her a lot of courage.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;How much have you had to drink tonight, Hannah?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Harry. Answer my question.&rdquo; Hannah was determined to have all her questions answered.</i><i><br /></i></p><p><i>Harry sighed, rubbing his forehead. &ldquo;Yes, Hannah. Yes, I was falling in love with you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>That heart-breaking feeling quickly began to settle in again. &ldquo;Ya know, I think you&rsquo;re a liar. You&rsquo;ve lied to me. I think you lied to me all through our relationship. If you really loved me, I don&rsquo;t think you would&rsquo;ve ended it. We talked about marriage and buying a lake house with a boat to take our kids out on. I don&rsquo;t think you meant any of it.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course I meant it. I meant every word.&rdquo; Harry paused, talking much quieter than he was before. &ldquo;I still do.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you loved me, you would&rsquo;ve tried to keep our relationship afloat. But instead you let it drown.&rdquo; Hannah was getting angrier by the minute, tears rolling down her face. &ldquo;If you loved me, we would still be together. If you loved me, we&rsquo;d be celebrating together right now. But instead I&rsquo;m hurting.&rdquo; Hannah&rsquo;s cries became more audible for Harry to hear through the phone. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hannah&hellip;. I&hellip;. I&mdash;&ldquo; Harry didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He regretted breaking up with her, but he didn&rsquo;t want to fail Hannah more than he already had. That&rsquo;s why he felt he had to end their relationship.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then you flew all the way out to Michigan. And for what? Just to break my heart that night?&rdquo; Hannah just cried for a long moment. Harry was paralyzed and couldn&rsquo;t speak. &ldquo;I thought we were meant to be. I saw a long future ahead of us. And now all you left me with is your t-shirt and a song professing your love of lies to me.&rdquo; Hannah let out a breath she didn&rsquo;t know she was holding. &ldquo;Everything hurts all the time, Harry. It doesn&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>It stung when Hannah brought up his old t-shirt. He almost called her out for what she did with his shirt, but instead he held back, hoping one day she&rsquo;ll hear his song. He finished the drink he was holding. &ldquo;Hannah, why don&rsquo;t you go inside and drink some water and get some sleep? You&rsquo;re going to be very hungover tomorrow.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what to do. You left me. You can&rsquo;t tell me what to do anymore.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then why did you&mdash;&ldquo; Harry stopped because he realized this was going to be a never ending circle. He had to find a way to make her hang up, even if it would only hurt her more. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re only call to yell at me, then I think you should hang up the phone. You need to move on, just like I did.&rdquo; It hurt Harry to say that, but he knew that this was for the best. He would never be able to be there for Hannah like she needed him to be. And with that, Hannah hung up.</i></p><p>The girls got their drinks from one of the dressing rooms. Hannah could hear &ldquo;From the Dining Table&rdquo; beginning to play. Katie was talking about something to one of the hairdressers, but Hannah walked away. She needed to see Harry perform this song. She made her way through the crowd. She stood kind of alone off the side, and from Harry&rsquo;s view, it kind of put a spotlight on her. Knowing she was staring him down as he performed, he was afraid she&rsquo;d ever talk to him again. It felt that fate had him spot Hannah right before he was about to sing the next line. On cue as it has been for every show, he sang, </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see it&rsquo;s written, it&rsquo;s all over his face</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won&rsquo;t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call, by the way&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Hannah couldn&rsquo;t help it, but she began to cry. Harry even felt his eyes fill up with tears as he sang these words. This song was already so emotional for him, but singing it to her face was a completely different feeling. His heart hurt, too. He looked away and interacted more with the crowd. Hannah kept taking big chugs of her vodka lemonade as Harry sang. She wiped her face when he stopped looking at her, hoping he wouldn&rsquo;t notice she was crying. But he found his way back to her eyes, never breaking contact as he finished the song. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Woke up the girl who looked just like you</p><p>I almost said your name.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t spoke since you went away</p><p>Comfortable silence is so overrated</p><p>Why won&rsquo;t you ever say what you want to say?</p><p>Even my phone misses your call&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Hannah watched the rest of show from the back of the stage, out of Harry&rsquo;s view. As Harry was waving goodbye to all his fans in the crowd, Hannah and Katie found Katie&rsquo;s younger sister and her friend. They were all excited about the show and Harry. Katie loved the ending of Harry&rsquo;s show. She too was a little drunk and was raving about him. Hannah smiled and laughed at Katie fangirling over her ex-boyfriend. Backstage Hannah caught of glimpse of Harry after he left the stage. He was hugging his bandmates for a job well done. Suddenly Mitch pointed Harry in Hannah&rsquo;s direction, and he began walking her way. </p><p>Harry was stopped in his path Hannah as the other girls reached him first. He was giving everyone little secrets about his show, how it felt to perform in front of that many people, and took some pictures with them. &ldquo;You guys, help yourself to anything, alright? I&rsquo;m just gonna say hello to Hannah.&rdquo; He looked up as he said that and winked at Hannah. He may have broken her heart, but he can still make her heart flutter with the smallest of gestures. </p><p>&ldquo;So what did you think?&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah waited a moment. There was so many ways she could answer this question, but she decided to keep it simple. &ldquo;Your band was amazing. Your songs were amazing. You were amazing, Harry. You belong up there on stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry chuckled, &ldquo;Well thank you, that means a lot. I feel weightless when I&rsquo;m up there, like nothing else matters except my music. It&rsquo;s weird. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah smiled back at him. &ldquo;Well you certainly put on quite the show, Mr. Styles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip; um, off topic, but&hellip; do you want to go somewhere more private to talk?&rdquo; Hannah nodded and stood from her seat to walk over. She wasn&rsquo;t even sure if she should be alone with Harry, but her body was already moving before she could make up her mind. Unknowingly to the other, they both became very nervous as they walked to Harry&rsquo;s dressing room. </p><p>Once in the room, Harry refilled Hannah&rsquo;s drink and made himself his own. Hannah sat on the edge of the black leather couch while Harry sat in the seat directly diagonal from her. You could feel the awkwardness in the room. They both had so much to say to each other, but neither knew where to start. Harry broke the silence, &ldquo;You look like you have something you want to say.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; Well&hellip; It was just an emotional concert. That&rsquo;s all. No big deal.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry reached forward, placing his hand on her left knee. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a big deal to me. I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you like that. You know you can talk to me about anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah sighed, knowing that she&rsquo;d have to tell me one way or another. Harry was persistent like that. &ldquo;I noticed you wrote more songs about me than I had originally thought. Really hit some nerves for me.&rdquo; Hannah admitted. She was scared to continue the conversation, but it was now or never. &ldquo;Is &lsquo;Anna&rsquo; about me?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry blushed, he felt like his face became as red as a tomato. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you said you wrote it in September of 2016, but we were already dating then. And the lyrics make it sound like you are talking about a girl you barely know&hellip;? I&rsquo;m confused.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I wrote it later, but I based it off of how I felt about you when we were first met. Well, no&hellip; um,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s nerves were catching up to him as he was admitting things he barely tells anyone else, let alone the person he wrote most of his songs about. &ldquo;The One Direction concert you came to on Liam&rsquo;s birthday? That&rsquo;s what I wrote about. I just knew that day I had to know you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Interesting&hellip;. And &lsquo;Ever Since New York&rsquo;? What&rsquo;s that all about?&rdquo; Hannah&rsquo;s anxiety was starting to kick in, unsure of the direction she was pushing the conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I wrote that song at two different points. I started it when we were going through stuff after you went back to school. Words were being twisted, trust issues.&rdquo; Hannah got this shivering feeling of sadness again. &ldquo;I got stuck for a while, but then I saw how happy you looked with all your friends and&hellip; uh&hellip;&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice turned into a whisper, &ldquo;there was some regret&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry took the biggest breath, afraid of Hannah&rsquo;s reaction, &ldquo;There was some regret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Hannah truly didn&rsquo;t know what to say. &ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; And the awkwardness set in once again. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah sipped her drinking, hoping for some liquid courage to help her continue on. &ldquo;So, is that why you wrote &lsquo;From the Dining Table&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry laughed to himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking all the serious questions, aren&rsquo;t you? There&rsquo;s no room for small talk.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah shrugged. &ldquo;I figured it&rsquo;s now or never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, to answer your question, it is why I wrote it. Turns out you&rsquo;d call me drunkenly very soon after.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah&rsquo;s face was now beat red. &ldquo;I am so very sorry about that. I was still very upset about our breakup. That song meant a lot to me,&rdquo; she said, referring to &ldquo;Sweet Creature.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s any consolation, it still means a lot to me, too.&rdquo; Harry softly smiled at Hannah. </p><p>Hannah was shaking. She had been feeling a lot of things this evening. &ldquo;Also, I&rsquo;m so very sorry about the Luke/t-shirt thing. I know you saw him. He needed a shirt, and we were rushing out of my house to get him to the airport. So I just gave it to him, and of course that&rsquo;s when you magically see him. It meant nothing. He means nothing to me. I&rsquo;m so sorry that I hurt you.&rdquo; These words flew out her mouth, almost making it hard to understand as she began to cry.</p><p>Harry quickly grabbed her hand to calm her down. &ldquo;Han&hellip; Han, it&rsquo;s quite alright. It&rsquo;s alright, love,&rdquo; he said, comforting her. He moved from his chair to sit right next her to wrap his arms around her as she cried into his shoulder. &ldquo;Thank you for explaining. It does mean a lot to me that you said that.&rdquo; Harry kissed the top of her and held her for a while until she calmed down. &nbsp;</p><p>Hannah leaned her head on his shoulder, catching her breath after crying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize, love. I&rsquo;m here for you.&rdquo; </p><p>She did her 4-7-8 breathing in her head a moment to completely calm down her anxiety. &ldquo;So&hellip; how come you&rsquo;re here? Like besides for your concert. Like why show up to my work? And why invite me backstage?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I wanted to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you broke up with me? I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry cleared his throat before answering to make give himself some more time to answer. He wasn&rsquo;t ready to tell her that he was still in love with her. Plus, she has a boyfriend so that&rsquo;ll just ruin everything. &ldquo;I, uh, just wanted to catch up. Make sure you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; Before he knew it, Harry was caught up in his own thoughts and said them out loud without any realization. &ldquo;I wanted to look into your pretty hazel eyes. Hear your voice again. Be close to you.&rdquo; He lightly bopped her nose with his pointer finger, causing her to give a small smile back.</p><p>Hannah sat up completely and slightly moved away from Harry to look him in the eye. She was visibly in shock, not expecting to hear any of that. &ldquo;Wait, what? Be close to me again?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes went big. &ldquo;Did I just say that out loud?&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah stood up and began to pace in the dressing room. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just say these things to me! Do you know how long it took for me to move on from you? How hard it was for me? I have a boyfriend now!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry swallowed nervously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Han. I didn&rsquo;t mean any of that.&rdquo; His heart rate picked up. He could feel his heart beating in his chest. &ldquo;Well, I did mean it. But I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you that. Not now at least. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Hannah stood across from a still seated and uncomfortable Harry with her arms folded across her chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been missing you for all these months. But I promise you that I have not just sitting around waiting for you to come back to me. <i>Oh no.</i>You told me to move on because you already had. So <i>I did</i>. And now you&rsquo;re telling me all this&hellip; this bullshit?!&rdquo; Hannah was fuming mad, pacing again.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry that I said those words to you all those months ago. But you were drunk. And I knew that our conversation was going to go in a circle because I felt that I wasn&rsquo;t good enough for you&hellip;. so I wanted you to leave me in the past.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;Turns out I was the one who couldn&rsquo;t leave you in the past.&rdquo;</p><p>Something inside Hannah was telling her to go back to Harry, but another part of her said that he will only break her heart again. &ldquo;Harry&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what you want me to say. I&rsquo;m dating Ryan.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stood up from the couch and began to slowly walk closer to Hannah. &ldquo;I know I am saying all of this at the wrong time. I didn&rsquo;t plan for it to come out this way, if ever.&rdquo; </p><p>Hannah sighed, unsure what to do. Harry began to move closer to her. Very quickly he was within arm&rsquo;s length from her, and he did not look like he was stopping any time soon. He began rubbing his hands up and down her arms to attempt to calm her down. He knew he was causing her to stress out. Hannah looked back up only to meet Harry&rsquo;s stare. It seemed like forever that they just stood like that. Then Hannah noticed Harry&rsquo;s gaze left her eyes and went to her lips momentarily before making their way back up her face. He began to move in. &ldquo;Just let me know if you want me to stop&hellip;&rdquo; And before she knew it, he was inches away from her face. He was so close she could smell the whiskey on his breath. Once again, he looked into her eyes, then at her lips, and back up again. Hannah&rsquo;s breathing picked up, and she froze. She knew this was wrong, but she had missed Harry for so long. His forehead pressed against hers. Then his lips grazed hers, and with no hesitation, he grabbed her hips to pull her closer and kissed her. Hannah froze until she couldn&rsquo;t anymore. Almost instinctively her arms wrapped around Harry&rsquo;s neck. It felt like no time had passed between them. There was electricity when they touched, and neither of them wanted this moment to end. </p><p><br /></p><p>*****************************************************************************************************</p><p><b><a href=\"http://shallwedancetogether.tumblr.com/post/176310327778\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b></p></p>",
