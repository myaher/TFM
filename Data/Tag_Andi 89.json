The screen shone brightly, TJ\u2019s name written across it. A glance at the clock told him it was 3:29 in the morning. With a deep breath and his shoulders steeled, he answered the call.</p><p>\u201cTJ?\u201d he asked, voice hoarse with sleep and tense with anger. The line stayed silent, forcing a loud sigh from Cyrus. \u201cTJ, I know it\u2019s you. I have your contact saved, and I know you\u2019ve been calling and not saying anything because you\u2019re a goddamn coward.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s breathing was the only indicator that he was still on the line.</p><p>\u201cAlright, then. You\u2019re not going to talk, so I am. You know, when I first met you, I was <i>terrified </i>that you were just going to hurt me. I guess I was right, but for some reason, you made me ignore my gut. You made me doubt Buffy, and you made me doubt <i>myself</i>, TJ. And then you went and did the one thing I was afraid of. For all of the things you were to me, you were also the one person who always knew how to make me feel like I was enough. With Andi and Buffy and Jonah, I always knew I was just a side character. I was supposed to help them with whatever they needed. If Andi wanted Jonah, I\u2019d step back so she could have him. If Buffy wanted me to hate you, I would. That was the unspoken agreement. But then you got me that <i>stupid </i>muffin.\u201d</p><p><i>Cyrus looked up at the boy in front of him. Was this the guy who\u2019d been bullying his best friend? Why didn\u2019t he look the part? </i></p><p>Focus, Cyrus. You\u2019re supposed to hate him<i>. He braced himself for the boy to say something to him, but when he did\u2026 When he did, it wasn\u2019t entirely awful. It was teasing, yes. It was a little bit terrifying, yes. But his words weren\u2019t laced with the malice he\u2019d assumed they\u2019d be. In fact, he was kind of&hellip;nice? </i>Stop, Cyrus<i>.</i></p><p><i>He\u2019d never wanted anything more than he wanted to hate TJ Kippen in that moment.

And then you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Tears stung at Cyrus&rsquo;s eyes, and he checked to make sure TJ was still listening. Sure enough, there was his heavy breathing, sure and steady. &ldquo;I remember crying about you to my parents, you know. You didn&rsquo;t deserve it, and I know that now, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Cyrus wiped the heels of his palms over his eyes. Tears fell no matter how many times he pushed them away. His mom sat down on the foot of his bed, reaching forward to take his hands.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hey, kiddo. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; he whimpered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s either I let Buffy hate me, or I hate someone who I don&rsquo;t even know deserves it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, kid?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Buffy told me about some guy on the basketball team- the captain, I guess. He&rsquo;s been bullying her since she joined. I just kind of&hellip;accepted it as fact that he was a bad person. But now I know him. And it&rsquo;s like- like I don&rsquo;t get how this works anymore. He&rsquo;s not just black and white anymore. He&rsquo;s like this&hellip;Mess of gray and colors I didn&rsquo;t even know existed.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you know why he was awful to Buffy?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s the worst part! Buffy thinks he&rsquo;s some misogynistic jock, but I think he was just scared. He was worried she&rsquo;d be better than him, so he took it out on her.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s the reason?&rdquo; Cyrus nodded somberly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not positive, but yes. It&rsquo;s the only thing that makes sense. His twin sister would have kicked his ass otherwise.&rdquo; Leslie smiled slightly at his language, raising an amused eyebrow.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip;Okay then. I think you&rsquo;ve already made your decision Cyrus. You don&rsquo;t want to lose either one of them, do you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then find a way to keep them both.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You know, I almost thought you were worth losing Buffy over. I can&rsquo;t believe I almost let you trick me. And then you had the fucking <i>audacity </i>to put me in danger with the gun? You didn&rsquo;t even care that someone could have gotten hurt- or <i>worse</i>. You just flashed those stupid puppy dog eyes and told me you were &lsquo;sorry&rsquo;. You act like the things you do don&rsquo;t hurt people, but they do, TJ.&rdquo;</p><p><i>The look in TJ&rsquo;s eyes when Cyrus tried to get him to leave with him hurt like nothing he&rsquo;d ever felt in the world. Walking away from him in that moment nearly hurt even more, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to care.</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s for TJ,<i> he thought. </i>Someone&rsquo;s going to get hurt if I don&rsquo;t leave.</p><p><i>He had to leave, no matter what he wanted to do. It was what was right. He could apologize all he wanted later, but for now&hellip; He had to leave.</i></p><p>&ldquo;That was one of the hardest things I have ever done, TJ Kippen. And then I just up and forgave you. You really made me believe you were worth forgiving over and over again. And now this? You humiliated me, and for what? To be with Kira? I can handle you choosing her, Teej, but you didn&rsquo;t say a <i>word</i>. And then you looked at me like you regretted it. And you know what? I almost believed you. You ruined everything like you always do, and I almost forgave you. Like I <i>always </i>do. I want you to know that all that? It&rsquo;s over, TJ.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s breathing on the line trembled in the same way that Cyrus&rsquo;s did. </p><p>&ldquo;God, TJ. How <i>could </i>you? Actually, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. If I took the time to ask what the fuck you were thinking every time you hurt me, I&rsquo;d never stop. One thing would bleed into the next, and none of this would ever end. So I am done asking questions. I think&hellip; I think I was in love with you. I thought I would be in love with you no matter what. Always and forever. To the moon and back. Until every star in the sky burns out. But I guess I have to get over that. You know, maybe I still love you. But I have to let it go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus wait-&rdquo; TJ protested. &ldquo;Please, just- hear me out. Please, Cyr-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, TJ. But it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye.&rdquo;</p>",

His head started to throb, and tears slowly started pouring out of his eyes. I do not want to feel like this he thought, I just want to feel normal, I just want to feel whole again. The tears suddenly  came rushing out of his eyes and he couldn\u2019t stop thinking \u2018I\u2019m so fucking weak\u2019 he got off his bed and started to tear his room apart,thinking it would take out his anger and frustration that was bubbling inside him. He threw the grey and blue comforter on the floor, followed by the sheets of constellations,ripping them off like some type of demon possessed him. As soon as he got the sheets off of his bed he punched his mattress as hard as he possibly could, but he still felt numb inside. Thinking that he needed another output  he then headed to his desk. He knocked off the alarm clock, shattering the plastic that projected the red numbers, the picture of him and Cyrus on his 15th birthday suddenly fell to the floor littering it tiny pieces of glass, and the last thing on his desk was his grandfather&rsquo;s cross necklace. With all his might he broke the chain in half, the only thing left was the pendant, he put it in his sweatpant pocket. He tried everything but he couldn\u2019t get the rage out; he had this built up for long, the next thing he knows he\u2019s on his bedroom floor rocking back and forth with his arms clutched to his knees. </p><p>Whenever he has an \u201cepisode\u201d it\u2019s usually brought on by a trigger but TJ can\u2019t think of any trigger. Right now his life is almost perfect. His grades are amazing, including math, he even got a B+ on the last test, the basketball team hasn\u2019t lost a game yet and hopefully will be heading to states soon, and him and Cyrus are doing amazing, he practically lives at the Goodman\u2019s. He can\u2019t think of why he feels this way. Or why he doesn\u2019t feel at all. His therapist said last week that these episodes can be brought on by little things piling into big things, but what little things are piling in his life to get him to this point? </p><p><i>Nothing, nothing\u2019s piling, i just feel this way because I\u2019m a fucking waste of space </i></p><p>TJ then remembers the whole conversation his therapist and him had. </p><p>\u201c<i>Sometimes episodes can have triggers, but they aren\u2019t necessary. You don\u2019t need a trigger to have an episode, you have a chemical imbalance in your brain and it acts up in strange ways. Just remember whenever this happens, you aren\u2019t weak.\u201d</i></p><p>I don\u2019t need a trigger </p><p><i>\u201cWhen this happens let\u2019s have a plan of what you can do okay?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUmm, can I call Cyrus and  have him here while we make the plan? It might be easier for me since he\u2019s the first person I go to.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus, I need Cyrus. TJ thought so he pulled out his phone and texted him. </i></p><p><b>To Cy- cy can you come over please </b></p><p><b>I really need you right now </b></p><p><b>Like as soon as possible </b></p><p><b>I\u2019ll be okay till then I promise </b></p><p><b>Ambers not home so I have nobody here, it\u2019s just me </b></p><p><b>To Teej- I\u2019m on way</b></p><p>Cyrus has never moved as fast as that moment when he received those text messages. He ran down his stairs shouting \u201cTJ\u2019s home alone and needs me, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back I\u2019ll text you guys when he calms down. I gotta go.\u201d He tore his bike out of the garage and biked as fast as humanly possible to the Kippen household. When he arrived he flew up the stairs into his boyfriends bedroom. He has never saw it this way before. There were no sheets on his bed, glass all over the floor, and some clothes sprawled around, but there was also a sobbing TJ in a ball of blankets. Cyrus lightly said \u201cTJ I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here. What do you need me to do.\u201d He slowly walked up to him, not wanting to startle him, but TJ automatically clung to his arms. When Cyrus entered he heard quite sniffles but now TJ was sobbing, clutching onto the grey fabric of the hoodie Cyrus was wearing. </p><p><i>\u201cCyrus! It\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d TJ\u2019s therapist, Sam, said </i></p><p><i>\u201cNice to meet you too!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell TJ wanted you here to talk about what to do when he\u2019s in the middle of a bad  episode. We made a little list. TJ why don\u2019t you start off.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan you announce that you\u2019re there and not automatically hug me. I know how that sounds but sometimes hugging just makes it worse, and sometimes I need it so if I need it during an episode I\u2019ll let you know. Also rubbing my back in little circles and ice water really helps. And breathing. And showers help to.\u201d Sam cut in </i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ what did we say about showers. You\u2019re leaving something out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBefore I get in the shower can you go into the bathroom and get all the razors, hair clippers, nail clippers and scissors out? And I\u2019ll leave the door unlocked and cracked open just Incase I need you.\u201d </i></p><p>Cyrus held TJ in his arms rubbing his back with small circles for about five minutes until his sobs subsided \u201cHey TJ, stay right here okay.\u201d Cyrus said softly while heading to the bathroom. He looked around the bathroom and took out every sharp object he could find, after that he tripled checked to make sure he didn\u2019t miss anything, he then left the bathroom and placed them in Mr. and Mrs.Kippens bedroom, this way they\u2019ll know he had an episode, he also texted them as soon as he arrived to the house. Cyrus walked back into the torn up bedroom and got to TJ\u2019s seemingly untouched dresser, what actually surprised him. He dug out a pair of dark grey Nike sweatpants, a navy blue NASA tee shirt, and a clean pair of underwear and set them on the toilet seat  in the bathroom with a clean towel, and placed a clean washcloth in the shower. </p><p>\u201cTeej, you\u2019re all set to shower now, okay? Make sure to leave the door cracked open, I\u2019ll be right here if you need anything.\u201d TJ simply nodded slumping to the bathroom, Cyrus has never seen his boyfriend look so weak, so drained. </p><p>As TJ showered Cyrus began picking up his bedroom. The first thing he did was get a dustpan and swept up the glass and plastic shards, thankful that TJs bedroom was wooden flooring and not carpet. The next thing he did was go into TJ\u2019s closet and get a clean set of sheets. As he was looking for a set of sheets Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but smile at what a dork his boyfriend was. He didn\u2019t have on pair of plain sheets. </p><p><i>\u201cCYRUS COME HERE!!! LOOK AT THESE SHEETS THEY ARE SO COOL!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ you are almost 16 years old, you do not need a pair of sheets with space ships on them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you kidding me yes I do! I\u2019ll be falling asleep feeling like I\u2019m exploring the sky! I\u2019m buying these and you can\u2019t stop my Cyrus Goodman.\u201d</i></p><p>Cyrus picked up the blue pair of sheets with grey and green space ships all over it, slightly smiling, and started to make TJ\u2019s queen sized bed. After the sheets were on his bed Cyrus debated whether to put the grey and blue comforter back on but decided against it, and got his black and white checkered comforter from the closet. His bed was freshly made with new sheets, new pillowcases, and even a clean comforter!  Cyrus took the dirty bedding to the laundry room and turned over the laundry, then headed back into the hallway of the bathroom. \u201cHey, are you alright T.J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m almost done anyway.\u201d And with that he heard the shower turn off. Cyrus headed to the kitchen and got a nice of glass of ice water and some ibuprofen, knowing how TJ\u2019s head gets after crying. He set those down on his night stand and continued picking up the bedroom until it\u2019s the way Cyrus has always seen it. </p><p>TJ steps out of the bathroom in the clothes Cyrus left for him. He looks better than when Cyrus arrived but he still looks defeated. He walks over to Cyrus and asks for a hug, Cyrus quickly obliges pulling the taller boy in for a hug, rubbing his back in smooth circles and whispering positive reinforcement in his ears. TJ is the first one to step away from the hug and look around the room. </p><p>\u201cCy, you didn\u2019t have to do this for me. I could\u2019ve done it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wanted to do it for you. Plus we both know you would\u2019ve put those sheets back on your bed when you needed clean ones anyway.\u201d A smiled appeared on his face with a \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d look in his eyes. TJ motions for them to both sit on the bed and they do, intertwining their fingers. They sit in a nice silence until Cyrus looks at TJ\u2019s arms. He notices the faded scarring from last year but he notices something else too. They aren\u2019t scars? But what are they? Cyrus moves his boyfriends arm so he can inspect it a little more and notices that they are scratch marks. </p><p><i>It was Wednesday which meant that TJ has his weekly therapy session. Today he had a lot to get off his chest. He felt like there was a big weight in the middle of his life and he didn\u2019t know where it came from, and all he wanted to do was cut away the problems, figuratively, and sadly literally. He told this all to Sam as he listened intently. Sam suggest to paint on his arms or even write on his arms, or do something to get his fingers moving which wasn\u2019t causing harm to himself. The next week TJ went in and asked if scratching yourself could be considered self harm, Sam nodded his head, all he can think is that he relapsed.</i></p><p>Cyrus gently looks at TJ\u2019s emerald green eyes and says \u201clook at me. It\u2019s okay, it wasn\u2019t a cut, it\u2019s just a minor set back. You\u2019re going to be okay I promise. It\u2019s just a few scratches.\u201d At this Cyrus pulls his phone out and texts Sam, he has his number for emergency purposes only. He takes a picture of TJ\u2019s arm and sends it to him with a short message</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t cut, which is a good thing but he did scratch hard enough to draw some blood. I\u2019m here now and I\u2019m probably spending the night. I texted his parents and let them know, but I wanted to let you know too. He\u2019s safe now, but if there is anyway he can get an appointment tomorrow, that would be incredible.\u201d Cyrus phone vibrated a few short minutes later with a text from Sam </p><p>\u201cCyrus, thank you so much for letting me know. He can come in at 9 am, you are welcome if he wants you there.\u201d Cyrus tells this to TJ as he drinks his water and takes his ibuprofen. TJ lays downs, his head in Cyrus\u2019s chest playing with fingers. </p><p>\u201cCyrus. Thank you for being here for me. I know I\u2019m a lot. I know you probably don\u2019t want to love somebody with these issues, but I\u2019m so lucky to have you. If you didn\u2019t come when you did I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. I had glass everywhere.\u201d Cyrus looks into his boyfriend&rsquo;s eyes </p><p>\u201cTJ I love you more than the world, I would do anything for you. It\u2019s going to be okay. But let\u2019s get some sleep. You have therapy at 9 tomorrow.\u201d At this the two boys lay down, with Cyrus being the big spoon, and they fell asleep.

His head started to throb, and tears slowly started pouring out of his eyes. I do not want to feel like this he thought, I just want to feel normal, I just want to feel whole again. The tears suddenly  came rushing out of his eyes and he couldn\u2019t stop thinking \u2018I\u2019m so fucking weak\u2019 he got off his bed and started to tear his room apart,thinking it would take out his anger and frustration that was bubbling inside him. He threw the grey and blue comforter on the floor, followed by the sheets of constellations,ripping them off like some type of demon possessed him. As soon as he got the sheets off of his bed he punched his mattress as hard as he possibly could, but he still felt numb inside. Thinking that he needed another output  he then headed to his desk. He knocked off the alarm clock, shattering the plastic that projected the red numbers, the picture of him and Cyrus on his 15th birthday suddenly fell to the floor littering it tiny pieces of glass, and the last thing on his desk was his grandfather\u2019s cross necklace. With all his might he broke the chain in half, the only thing left was the pendant, he put it in his sweatpant pocket. He tried everything but he couldn\u2019t get the rage out; he had this built up for long, the next thing he knows he\u2019s on his bedroom floor rocking back and forth with his arms clutched to his knees. </p><p>Whenever he has an \u201cepisode\u201d it\u2019s usually brought on by a trigger but TJ can\u2019t think of any trigger. Right now his life is almost perfect. His grades are amazing, including math, he even got a B+ on the last test, the basketball team hasn\u2019t lost a game yet and hopefully will be heading to states soon, and him and Cyrus are doing amazing, he practically lives at the Goodman\u2019s. He can\u2019t think of why he feels this way. Or why he doesn\u2019t feel at all. His therapist said last week that these episodes can be brought on by little things piling into big things, but what little things are piling in his life to get him to this point? </p><p><i>Nothing, nothing\u2019s piling, i just feel this way because I\u2019m a fucking waste of space </i></p><p>TJ then remembers the whole conversation his therapist and him had. </p><p>\u201c<i>Sometimes episodes can have triggers, but they aren\u2019t necessary. You don\u2019t need a trigger to have an episode, you have a chemical imbalance in your brain and it acts up in strange ways. Just remember whenever this happens, you aren\u2019t weak.\u201d</i></p><p>I don\u2019t need a trigger </p><p><i>\u201cWhen this happens let\u2019s have a plan of what you can do okay?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUmm, can I call Cyrus and  have him here while we make the plan? It might be easier for me since he\u2019s the first person I go to.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course\u201d</i></p><p><i>Cyrus, I need Cyrus. TJ thought so he pulled out his phone and texted him. </i></p><p><b>To Cy- cy can you come over please </b></p><p><b>I really need you right now </b></p><p><b>Like as soon as possible </b></p><p><b>I\u2019ll be okay till then I promise </b></p><p><b>Ambers not home so I have nobody here, it\u2019s just me </b></p><p><b>To Teej- I\u2019m on way</b></p><p>Cyrus has never moved as fast as that moment when he received those text messages. He ran down his stairs shouting \u201cTJ\u2019s home alone and needs me, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back I\u2019ll text you guys when he calms down. I gotta go.\u201d He tore his bike out of the garage and biked as fast as humanly possible to the Kippen household. When he arrived he flew up the stairs into his boyfriends bedroom. He has never saw it this way before. There were no sheets on his bed, glass all over the floor, and some clothes sprawled around, but there was also a sobbing TJ in a ball of blankets. Cyrus lightly said \u201cTJ I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here. What do you need me to do.\u201d He slowly walked up to him, not wanting to startle him, but TJ automatically clung to his arms. When Cyrus entered he heard quite sniffles but now TJ was sobbing, clutching onto the grey fabric of the hoodie Cyrus was wearing. </p><p><i>\u201cCyrus! It\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d TJ\u2019s therapist, Sam, said </i></p><p><i>\u201cNice to meet you too!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell TJ wanted you here to talk about what to do when he\u2019s in the middle of a bad  episode. We made a little list. TJ why don\u2019t you start off.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan you announce that you\u2019re there and not automatically hug me. I know how that sounds but sometimes hugging just makes it worse, and sometimes I need it so if I need it during an episode I\u2019ll let you know. Also rubbing my back in little circles and ice water really helps. And breathing. And showers help to.\u201d Sam cut in </i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ what did we say about showers. You\u2019re leaving something out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBefore I get in the shower can you go into the bathroom and get all the razors, hair clippers, nail clippers and scissors out? And I\u2019ll leave the door unlocked and cracked open just Incase I need you.\u201d </i></p><p>Cyrus held TJ in his arms rubbing his back with small circles for about five minutes until his sobs subsided \u201cHey TJ, stay right here okay.\u201d Cyrus said softly while heading to the bathroom. He looked around the bathroom and took out every sharp object he could find, after that he tripled checked to make sure he didn\u2019t miss anything, he then left the bathroom and placed them in Mr. and Mrs.Kippens bedroom, this way they\u2019ll know he had an episode, he also texted them as soon as he arrived to the house. Cyrus walked back into the torn up bedroom and got to TJ\u2019s seemingly untouched dresser, what actually surprised him. He dug out a pair of dark grey Nike sweatpants, a navy blue NASA tee shirt, and a clean pair of underwear and set them on the toilet seat  in the bathroom with a clean towel, and placed a clean washcloth in the shower. </p><p>\u201cTeej, you\u2019re all set to shower now, okay? Make sure to leave the door cracked open, I\u2019ll be right here if you need anything.\u201d TJ simply nodded slumping to the bathroom, Cyrus has never seen his boyfriend look so weak, so drained. </p><p>As TJ showered Cyrus began picking up his bedroom. The first thing he did was get a dustpan and swept up the glass and plastic shards, thankful that TJs bedroom was wooden flooring and not carpet. The next thing he did was go into TJ\u2019s closet and get a clean set of sheets. As he was looking for a set of sheets Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but smile at what a dork his boyfriend was. He didn\u2019t have on pair of plain sheets. </p><p><i>\u201cCYRUS COME HERE!!! LOOK AT THESE SHEETS THEY ARE SO COOL!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTJ you are almost 16 years old, you do not need a pair of sheets with space ships on them.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you kidding me yes I do! I\u2019ll be falling asleep feeling like I\u2019m exploring the sky! I\u2019m buying these and you can\u2019t stop my Cyrus Goodman.\u201d</i></p><p>Cyrus picked up the blue pair of sheets with grey and green space ships all over it, slightly smiling, and started to make TJ\u2019s queen sized bed. After the sheets were on his bed Cyrus debated whether to put the grey and blue comforter back on but decided against it, and got his black and white checkered comforter from the closet. His bed was freshly made with new sheets, new pillowcases, and even a clean comforter!  Cyrus took the dirty bedding to the laundry room and turned over the laundry, then headed back into the hallway of the bathroom. \u201cHey, are you alright T.J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m almost done anyway.\u201d And with that he heard the shower turn off. Cyrus headed to the kitchen and got a nice of glass of ice water and some ibuprofen, knowing how TJ\u2019s head gets after crying. He set those down on his night stand and continued picking up the bedroom until it\u2019s the way Cyrus has always seen it. </p><p>TJ steps out of the bathroom in the clothes Cyrus left for him. He looks better than when Cyrus arrived but he still looks defeated. He walks over to Cyrus and asks for a hug, Cyrus quickly obliges pulling the taller boy in for a hug, rubbing his back in smooth circles and whispering positive reinforcement in his ears. TJ is the first one to step away from the hug and look around the room. </p><p>\u201cCy, you didn\u2019t have to do this for me. I could\u2019ve done it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wanted to do it for you. Plus we both know you would\u2019ve put those sheets back on your bed when you needed clean ones anyway.\u201d A smiled appeared on his face with a \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d look in his eyes. TJ motions for them to both sit on the bed and they do, intertwining their fingers. They sit in a nice silence until Cyrus looks at TJ\u2019s arms. He notices the faded scarring from last year but he notices something else too. They aren\u2019t scars? But what are they? Cyrus moves his boyfriends arm so he can inspect it a little more and notices that they are scratch marks. </p><p><i>It was Wednesday which meant that TJ has his weekly therapy session. Today he had a lot to get off his chest. He felt like there was a big weight in the middle of his life and he didn\u2019t know where it came from, and all he wanted to do was cut away the problems, figuratively, and sadly literally. He told this all to Sam as he listened intently. Sam suggest to paint on his arms or even write on his arms, or do something to get his fingers moving which wasn\u2019t causing harm to himself. The next week TJ went in and asked if scratching yourself could be considered self harm, Sam nodded his head, all he can think is that he relapsed.</i></p><p>Cyrus gently looks at TJ\u2019s emerald green eyes and says \u201clook at me. It\u2019s okay, it wasn\u2019t a cut, it\u2019s just a minor set back. You\u2019re going to be okay I promise. It\u2019s just a few scratches.\u201d At this Cyrus pulls his phone out and texts Sam, he has his number for emergency purposes only. He takes a picture of TJ\u2019s arm and sends it to him with a short message</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t cut, which is a good thing but he did scratch hard enough to draw some blood. I\u2019m here now and I\u2019m probably spending the night. I texted his parents and let them know, but I wanted to let you know too. He\u2019s safe now, but if there is anyway he can get an appointment tomorrow, that would be incredible.\u201d Cyrus phone vibrated a few short minutes later with a text from Sam </p><p>\u201cCyrus, thank you so much for letting me know. He can come in at 9 am, you are welcome if he wants you there.\u201d Cyrus tells this to TJ as he drinks his water and takes his ibuprofen. TJ lays downs, his head in Cyrus\u2019s chest playing with fingers. </p><p>\u201cCyrus. Thank you for being here for me. I know I\u2019m a lot. I know you probably don\u2019t want to love somebody with these issues, but I\u2019m so lucky to have you. If you didn\u2019t come when you did I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. I had glass everywhere.\u201d Cyrus looks into his boyfriend\u2019s eyes </p><p>\u201cTJ I love you more than the world, I would do anything for you. It\u2019s going to be okay. But let\u2019s get some sleep. You have therapy at 9 tomorrow.\u201d At this the two boys lay down, with Cyrus being the big spoon, and they fell asleep. When his parents got home later that night they looked into his sons room and realised how lucky they were to have Cyrus Goodman in their lives.</p></p>",

Today he had a lot to get off his chest. He felt like there was a big weight in the middle of his life and he didn\u2019t know where it came from, and all he wanted to do was cut away the problems, figuratively, and sadly literally. He told this all to Sam as he listened intently. Sam suggest to paint on his arms or even write on his arms, or do something to get his fingers moving which wasn\u2019t causing harm to himself. The next week TJ went in and asked if scratching yourself could be considered self harm, Sam nodded his head, all he can think is that he relapsed.</i></p><p>Cyrus gently looks at TJ\u2019s emerald green eyes and says \u201clook at me. It\u2019s okay, it wasn\u2019t a cut, it\u2019s just a minor set back. You\u2019re going to be okay I promise. It\u2019s just a few scratches.\u201d At this Cyrus pulls his phone out and texts Sam, he has his number for emergency purposes only. He takes a picture of TJ\u2019s arm and sends it to him with a short message</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t cut, which is a good thing but he did scratch hard enough to draw some blood. I\u2019m here now and I\u2019m probably spending the night. I texted his parents and let them know, but I wanted to let you know too. He\u2019s safe now, but if there is anyway he can get an appointment tomorrow, that would be incredible.\u201d Cyrus phone vibrated a few short minutes later with a text from Sam </p><p>\u201cCyrus, thank you so much for letting me know. He can come in at 9 am, you are welcome if he wants you there.\u201d Cyrus tells this to TJ as he drinks his water and takes his ibuprofen. TJ lays downs, his head in Cyrus\u2019s chest playing with fingers. </p><p>\u201cCyrus. Thank you for being here for me. I know I\u2019m a lot. I know you probably don\u2019t want to love somebody with these issues, but I\u2019m so lucky to have you. If you didn\u2019t come when you did I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened. I had glass everywhere.\u201d Cyrus looks into his boyfriend\u2019s eyes </p><p>\u201cTJ I love you more than the world, I would do anything for you. It\u2019s going to be okay. But let\u2019s get some sleep. You have therapy at 9 tomorrow.\u201d At this the two boys lay down, with Cyrus being the big spoon, and they fell asleep. When his parents got home later that night they looked into his sons room and realised how lucky they were to have Cyrus Goodman in their lives.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>You&rsquo;re okay </h1><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Summary:</b> Tj has a bad panic attack during a depressive episode, and Cyrus is there for him </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Trigger warnings:</b> self harm, get light mentioning but please don&rsquo;t not read if you are triggered </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Disclaimer:</b> everything TJ&rsquo;s therapist says is what my therapist has said to me. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><b>Word count:</b> 2043 </p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not enough</i>.&rdquo; Those words kept echoing through TJ&rsquo;s  head until it was the only sound he could hear. His head started to throb, and tears slowly started pouring out of his eyes. I do not want to feel like this he thought, I just want to feel normal, I just want to feel whole again. The tears suddenly  came rushing out of his eyes and he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so fucking weak&rsquo; he got off his bed and started to tear his room apart,thinking it would take out his anger and frustration that was bubbling inside him. He threw the grey and blue comforter on the floor, followed by the sheets of constellations,ripping them off like some type of demon possessed him. As soon as he got the sheets off of his bed he punched his mattress as hard as he possibly could, but he still felt numb inside. Thinking that he needed another output  he then headed to his desk. He knocked off the alarm clock, shattering the plastic that projected the red numbers, the picture of him and Cyrus on his 15th birthday suddenly fell to the floor littering it tiny pieces of glass, and the last thing on his desk was his grandfather&rsquo;s cross necklace. With all his might he broke the chain in half, the only thing left was the pendant, he put it in his sweatpant pocket. He tried everything but he couldn&rsquo;t get the rage out; he had this built up for long, the next thing he knows he&rsquo;s on his bedroom floor rocking back and forth with his arms clutched to his knees. </p><p>Whenever he has an &ldquo;episode&rdquo; it&rsquo;s usually brought on by a trigger but TJ can&rsquo;t think of any trigger. Right now his life is almost perfect. His grades are amazing, including math, he even got a B+ on the last test, the basketball team hasn&rsquo;t lost a game yet and hopefully will be heading to states soon, and him and Cyrus are doing amazing, he practically lives at the Goodman&rsquo;s. He can&rsquo;t think of why he feels this way. Or why he doesn&rsquo;t feel at all. His therapist said last week that these episodes can be brought on by little things piling into big things, but what little things are piling in his life to get him to this point? </p><p><i>Nothing, nothing&rsquo;s piling, i just feel this way because I&rsquo;m a fucking waste of space </i></p><p>TJ then remembers the whole conversation his therapist and him had. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Sometimes episodes can have triggers, but they aren&rsquo;t necessary. You don&rsquo;t need a trigger to have an episode, you have a chemical imbalance in your brain and it acts up in strange ways. Just remember whenever this happens, you aren&rsquo;t weak.&rdquo;</i></p><p>I don&rsquo;t need a trigger </p><p><i>&ldquo;When this happens let&rsquo;s have a plan of what you can do okay?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Umm, can I call Cyrus and  have him here while we make the plan? It might be easier for me since he&rsquo;s the first person I go to.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Cyrus, I need Cyrus. TJ thought so he pulled out his phone and texted him. </i></p><p><b>To Cy- cy can you come over please </b></p><p><b>I really need you right now </b></p><p><b>Like as soon as possible </b></p><p><b>I&rsquo;ll be okay till then I promise </b></p><p><b>Ambers not home so I have nobody here, it&rsquo;s just me </b></p><p><b>To Teej- I&rsquo;m on way</b></p><p>Cyrus has never moved as fast as that moment when he received those text messages. He ran down his stairs shouting &ldquo;TJ&rsquo;s home alone and needs me, I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be back I&rsquo;ll text you guys when he calms down. I gotta go.&rdquo; He tore his bike out of the garage and biked as fast as humanly possible to the Kippen household. When he arrived he flew up the stairs into his boyfriends bedroom. He has never saw it this way before. There were no sheets on his bed, glass all over the floor, and some clothes sprawled around, but there was also a sobbing TJ in a ball of blankets. Cyrus lightly said &ldquo;TJ I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m here. What do you need me to do.&rdquo; He slowly walked up to him, not wanting to startle him, but TJ automatically clung to his arms. When Cyrus entered he heard quite sniffles but now TJ was sobbing, clutching onto the grey fabric of the hoodie Cyrus was wearing. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Cyrus! It&rsquo;s so nice to meet you!&rdquo; TJ&rsquo;s therapist, Sam, said </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nice to meet you too!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well TJ wanted you here to talk about what to do when he&rsquo;s in the middle of a bad  episode. We made a little list. TJ why don&rsquo;t you start off.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can you announce that you&rsquo;re there and not automatically hug me. I know how that sounds but sometimes hugging just makes it worse, and sometimes I need it so if I need it during an episode I&rsquo;ll let you know. Also rubbing my back in little circles and ice water really helps. And breathing. And showers help to.&rdquo; Sam cut in </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;TJ what did we say about showers. You&rsquo;re leaving something out.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Before I get in the shower can you go into the bathroom and get all the razors, hair clippers, nail clippers and scissors out? And I&rsquo;ll leave the door unlocked and cracked open just Incase I need you.&rdquo; </i></p><p>Cyrus held TJ in his arms rubbing his back with small circles for about five minutes until his sobs subsided &ldquo;Hey TJ, stay right here okay.&rdquo; Cyrus said softly while heading to the bathroom. He looked around the bathroom and took out every sharp object he could find, after that he tripled checked to make sure he didn&rsquo;t miss anything, he then left the bathroom and placed them in Mr. and Mrs.Kippens bedroom, this way they&rsquo;ll know he had an episode, he also texted them as soon as he arrived to the house. Cyrus walked back into the torn up bedroom and got to TJ&rsquo;s seemingly untouched dresser, what actually surprised him. He dug out a pair of dark grey Nike sweatpants, a navy blue NASA tee shirt, and a clean pair of underwear and set them on the toilet seat  in the bathroom with a clean towel, and placed a clean washcloth in the shower. </p><p>&ldquo;Teej, you&rsquo;re all set to shower now, okay? Make sure to leave the door cracked open, I&rsquo;ll be right here if you need anything.&rdquo; TJ simply nodded slumping to the bathroom, Cyrus has never seen his boyfriend look so weak, so drained. </p><p>As TJ showered Cyrus began picking up his bedroom. The first thing he did was get a dustpan and swept up the glass and plastic shards, thankful that TJs bedroom was wooden flooring and not carpet. The next thing he did was go into TJ&rsquo;s closet and get a clean set of sheets. As he was looking for a set of sheets Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at what a dork his boyfriend was. He didn&rsquo;t have on pair of plain sheets. </p><p><i>&ldquo;CYRUS COME HERE!!! LOOK AT THESE SHEETS THEY ARE SO COOL!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;TJ you are almost 16 years old, you do not need a pair of sheets with space ships on them.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you kidding me yes I do! I&rsquo;ll be falling asleep feeling like I&rsquo;m exploring the sky! I&rsquo;m buying these and you can&rsquo;t stop my Cyrus Goodman.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Cyrus picked up the blue pair of sheets with grey and green space ships all over it, slightly smiling, and started to make TJ&rsquo;s queen sized bed. After the sheets were on his bed Cyrus debated whether to put the grey and blue comforter back on but decided against it, and got his black and white checkered comforter from the closet. His bed was freshly made with new sheets, new pillowcases, and even a clean comforter!  Cyrus took the dirty bedding to the laundry room and turned over the laundry, then headed back into the hallway of the bathroom. &ldquo;Hey, are you alright T.J.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m almost done anyway.&rdquo; And with that he heard the shower turn off. Cyrus headed to the kitchen and got a nice of glass of ice water and some ibuprofen, knowing how TJ&rsquo;s head gets after crying. He set those down on his night stand and continued picking up the bedroom until it&rsquo;s the way Cyrus has always seen it. </p><p>TJ steps out of the bathroom in the clothes Cyrus left for him. He looks better than when Cyrus arrived but he still looks defeated. He walks over to Cyrus and asks for a hug, Cyrus quickly obliges pulling the taller boy in for a hug, rubbing his back in smooth circles and whispering positive reinforcement in his ears. TJ is the first one to step away from the hug and look around the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Cy, you didn&rsquo;t have to do this for me. I could&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to do it for you. Plus we both know you would&rsquo;ve put those sheets back on your bed when you needed clean ones anyway.&rdquo; A smiled appeared on his face with a &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right&rdquo; look in his eyes. TJ motions for them to both sit on the bed and they do, intertwining their fingers. They sit in a nice silence until Cyrus looks at TJ&rsquo;s arms. He notices the faded scarring from last year but he notices something else too. They aren&rsquo;t scars? But what are they? Cyrus moves his boyfriends arm so he can inspect it a little more and notices that they are scratch marks. </p><p><i>It was Wednesday which meant that TJ has his weekly therapy session.

I had glass everywhere.&rdquo; Cyrus looks into his boyfriend&rsquo;s eyes </p><p>&ldquo;TJ I love you more than the world, I would do anything for you. It&rsquo;s going to be okay.

I don\u2019t think the specifics of what he\u2019s there for are all that important, more the fact that Cyrus gets a plot dedicated to him in 3x19 and it involves him succeeding at something.\u00a0</p><p>However, we do have some very revealing photos involving that plot that shed light on what\u2019s likely to go down in that ep. For 3x19 they filmed at Murray High School on Friday and Saturday. On the Friday they filmed the Spikes big game at the gym and we know that Sofia, Josh, Peyton, Asher, Luke, and Yasmeen were all on set that day at one time or another. On the Saturday we know Luke, Josh, Anson, Peyton, and Asher were on set for sure. Raquel was never spotted on set that week and her Utah adventures story on insta only has posts from eps 13, 15, and 21.

Photo 2 was posted by Anson\u2019s family and shows him and Josh at the theatre. Photo 3 was posted by Paul Hoen a few weeks later and show Luke in the same green sweater as in photo 1, note the dark red walls and the black flooring. Photo 4 was one I found on instagram of the Murray High theatre where we get a good view of the dark red walls and the black stage:</p><p>1)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"640\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5055d4dd11a6481bb492fbd0515c5d8/tumblr_inline_pp91sulMuU1vdw8mm_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"640\"/></figure><p>2)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4dd0ba8e56346b7ed0fc1c214f85a07/tumblr_inline_pp91tf65lf1vdw8mm_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure><p>3)\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d95bec3e86e7731857a6bd1d59f61f94/tumblr_inline_pp91u8Iaj01vdw8mm_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure><p>4)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ec2ef17e2c6ecfb3501ba57b469ac1d/tumblr_inline_pp91vhCNqz1vdw8mm_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure><p>So it does look like the basketball game and the theatre event take place on the same day and that TJ shows up at the theatre which could potentially set the stage for a rap or hug or whatever public gesture is allowed so he and Cyrus can reconcile. There\u2019s a good chance Andi and Jonah at least are at or around the theatre as well but we won\u2019t know for sure until the ep airs; if Buffy is busy getting ready for the game or celebrating immediately after the game it may explain why Sofia wasn\u2019t spotted on set that day. I don\u2019t think it necessarily matters which comes first but that TJ is at both the game and the theatre is significant especially with this being his first ep back since 3x15.\u00a0So looks like we can look forward to some nice moments in 3x19 when it airs in like three months</p>",

For 3x19 they filmed at Murray High School on Friday and Saturday.

On the Saturday we know Luke, Josh, Anson, Peyton, and Asher were on set for sure. Raquel was never spotted on set that week and her Utah adventures story on insta only has posts from eps 13, 15, and 21.

Photo 3 was posted by Paul Hoen a few weeks later and show Luke in the same green sweater as in photo 1, note the dark red walls and the black flooring.
