Stark really </i>were<i> the villain of the Marvel universe? \u00a0How would that work? \u00a0Tony himself is about to find out, as he battles his inner demons (and some outer ones, too) across a multiverse of infinite possibilities.</i></p><!-- more --><hr><p>The impact\nleft Tony dazed, but the robot wasn\u2019t subject to such things.\u00a0 Before he had time to recover, it lifted Tony\nup and slammed him back down again.\u00a0 He\nsaw stars.\u00a0 The only thing he could think\nof to do was to fire all the repulsors at once, driving himself and the robot\ninto the pavement of 42<sup>nd</sup> Street.\u00a0\nThey dug a furrow in the asphalt as they skidded along, throwing cars\nout of the way as they went.</p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\"><i>The Proof of Concept really wasn\u2019t built to\ntake this kind of punishment</i>, JANIS observed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cIf you can\u2019t\nsay anything useful you can shut the hell up!\u201d Tony shouted.\u00a0 He and the robot roared past the library and\nrammed into the steps to the 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue subway station, where they\ngot stuck.\u00a0 The robot grabbed Tony by the\nshoulder and lifted him to bang him against the stairs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">He was bracing\nfor the impact when somebody caught him.\u00a0\nThe red giantess ripped him out of the robot\u2019s claws and then gave the\nmachine a good hard kick.\u00a0 The railings\nbroke, and the robot went bouncing down the steps into the subway station.\u00a0 Satisfied, the giantess put Tony down gently,\nand then ran after it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony got up,\ntook a deep breath and tried to stop his ears ringing, then ran after her.\u00a0 \u201cHey!\u201d he shouted.\u00a0 What was it JANIS had called her?\u00a0 \u201cDr. Ross!\u00a0\nDr. Ross!\u00a0 Try and get a hand\nbetween those armor plates!\u201d</p><p class=\"Standard\">There weren\u2019t\na lot of people taking the number seven train at one in the morning, but half a\ndozen or so were still screaming and running for the other exit as the giantess\nand the robot grappled on the platform.\u00a0\nShe\u2019d wrapped her legs around it and was pulling at something, while it slammed\nher repeatedly into an ad for <i style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Lion\nKing</i> on Broadway.\u00a0 Finally she lost\nher grip and dropped to the floor, apparently unconscious.\u00a0 The robot rearranged itself and picked up a\nheavy wooden bench, ready to crush her with it.</p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">But when it\nmoved, Tony saw that one of the plates was bent open, exposing a layer of\ncarbon fiber weave inside.\u00a0 <i>Good</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony ran up\nand blasted the bench out of its arms with a repulsor.\u00a0 It went flying and landed across the\ntrack.\u00a0 \u201cHere I am!\u00a0 Come and get me!\u201d Tony ordered.\u00a0 He jumped down to the track, and kicked the\nbench aside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">The robot\nhad taken quite a bit of damage on the trip down 42<sup>nd</sup>.\u00a0 Some of its joints were sparking and one leg\nwas dragging, but it crawled towards him gamely enough, rotating the damaged\nportion away from him.\u00a0 As it scuttled down\nonto the tracks, Tony fired his thrusters just hard enough to somersault over it\nand grab the exposed fibers with both hands.\u00a0\nUpon landing, he brought his boots down on the third rail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Carbon fiber\ndidn\u2019t burn, but it <i>did</i> conduct\nelectricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Nearly seven\nhundred volts crackled over the skin of the suit, and passed across the\ngauntlets into the robot\u2019s interior.\u00a0 The\nmesh built in kept the current from reaching Tony\u2019s body, but the HUD turned to\nstatic and the servos seized, locking Tony in one place.\u00a0 A moment later the display flickered back to\nlife, but the lights were out in the subway station.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cJANIS,\nswitch to night vision,\u201d he ordered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\"><i>We don\u2019t have that</i>, the computer said.\u00a0 <i>Would\nyou like the flashlight?</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes,\u201d said\nTony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\"><i>Yes, what?</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, <i>please</i>,\u201d he groaned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">A light came\non in the suit\u2019s chest, and fell on the remains of the robot, smoking and twitching\non the tracks in front of Tony.\u00a0 He gave\nit a kick to be sure it wasn\u2019t faking, but it did not respond.\u00a0 Apparently they\u2019d beaten it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Satisfied of\nthat, Tony climbed back onto the platform to look for the giantess.\u00a0 There was no sign of her at first, which left\nhim wondering how an eight-foot red woman just disappeared.\u00a0 Then, however, he saw the shape lying\nhalf-conscious below the <i>Lion King</i>\nad.\u00a0 She was of perfectly normal stature\nand had fair Caucasian skin, but she was wearing the black sports bra and bike\nshorts, both stretched out a bit too big for her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony held\nout a gauntleted hand to her.\u00a0 \u201cDr. Ross?\u201d\nhe asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">She took his\nhand and was coughing as he helped her up..\u00a0\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known I was coming back to this,\u201d she said, \u201cI would have stayed\nin Canada.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cAre you\nhurt?\u201d Tony wanted to know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d she scoffed, and although she looked rather haggard and exhausted, she\ndidn\u2019t seem to be bleeding.\u00a0 She was\ncertainly able to stand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cAll right,\u201d\nhe said.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the building.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">There were\nnow a dozen police cars, as well as fire trucks and ambulances, surrounding the\nentrance to Grand Central Station.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s\ncounterpart was not in evidence, but there was a woman hurrying down the\nsteps.\u00a0 Tony recognized her at once.\u00a0 How could he not?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">This was it,\nthen.\u00a0 He was about to meet this world\u2019s\nPepper Potts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">She wore her\nhair short, which made sense.\u00a0 Long hair\nwould easily get tangled in the inner workings of the suit.\u00a0 And she was dressed in jogging clothes \u2013 a pair\nof yoga pants and one of those wicking shirts.\u00a0\nWhen she saw Tony and Dr. Ross, she stopped short on the bottom\nstep.\u00a0 Her eyes flicked from one to the other,\nas if she couldn\u2019t decide which of them she was more astonished to see.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cBetty!\u00a0 Are you all right?\u201d she asked, running to\nmeet them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d\nDr. Ross replied.\u00a0 Tony handed her off to\nMiss Potts, who helped the other woman sit down on the steps and wrapped her\nown jacket around her.\u00a0 The EMTs started\nto approach, but Dr. Ross shook her head, and Miss Potts waved them away.\u00a0 She sat with her a while longer, and then got\nup to confront Tony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony,\u201d she\nsaid, coming up to look him in the eye.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\nin the world is going <i>on</i>?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Yeah, that\nwas Pepper Potts, all right.\u00a0 Tony held his\nhands up.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not Tony,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Miss Potts\npaused and looked him over, taking in the beard and the fact that he was\nwearing the suit, and nodded slowly.\u00a0 \u201cThen\nwho are you?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cThat\u2019s his\ncousin!\u201d another voice panted, and Beth the security guard arrived.\u00a0 She was now wearing a leather jacket over a knee-length\nblack dress covered in sequins \u2013 she must have been out somewhere, only for the\nrobot fight to get her attention when she realized it was at her\nworkplace.\u00a0 She was out of breath and\nrunning awkwardly in her high heeled shoes.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s his cousin Arno.\u00a0 From\nItaly,\u201d she said, as she stopped to catch her breath.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Miss Potts\nbit her lip and looked Tony over.\u00a0 \u201cBullshit,\u201d\nshe declared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cEvery word,\u201d\nTony agreed with a nervous chuckle.\u00a0 \u201cLook,\nwe\u2019ll explain, but I gotta make sure he\u2019s okay first.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cMake sure\nwho\u2019s okay?\u201d Miss Potts asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony,\u201d said\nTony, feeling stupid saying it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Several\nexpressions crossed her face, including cynicism, an urge to laugh, and anger,\nand then she settled on curiosity.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m\ncoming with you,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cMs. Cabe,\ncan you look after Betty, please?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI don\u2019t need\nlooking after,\u201d Dr. Ross complained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cOf course,\nMiss Potts,\u201d said Beth, and sat down beside Dr. Ross.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony had\nleft his double by the ticket counters.\u00a0\nWith the suit on it was very awkward to climb over and through the\nrubble to get back to him, but Tony felt unwilling to take it off.\u00a0 That robot had come out of nowhere, and who\nknew what might prompt a second one to materialize.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYou\u2019re the\none who phoned me the other day,\u201d Miss Potts said, picking her way through the\nwreckage behind him with far more grace.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you the one who shut down the suits?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, but it\u2019s\nkind of a long story,\u201d said Tony.\u00a0 He\nheaved himself up on the counter, and looked down.\u00a0 There was his double, curled up and grimacing\nin pain.\u00a0 \u201cFound him!\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony!\u201d\u00a0 Miss Potts climbed over the counter and\ndropped down next to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m\nfine,\u201d said the other, holding up a hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo, you\u2019re\nnot,\u201d said Miss Potts.\u00a0 \u201cBut you will\nbe.\u00a0 Arno, go get the EMTs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">It took Tony\na moment to realize that by \u2018Arno\u2019 she meant him.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t given her another name to call\nhim.\u00a0 \u201cOn my way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Circumstances\nbeing what they were, he waited until he was out of the suit and the two of\nthem were sitting in a hospital waiting room while his counterpart\u2019s ribs got\nx-rayed before he said, \u201cmy name isn\u2019t Arno, by the way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI didn\u2019t\nthink it was,\u201d Miss Potts replied, nervously fiddling with her phone.\u00a0 She was scrolling through news websites too\nfast to actually read them\u2026 she must be looking at the pictures and taking in\nthe sound bites instead.\u00a0 There were\nimages of the destruction around Grand Central, a blurry cell phone photo of\nDr. Ross and the robot up on the Chrysler Building, and a clearer but still\namateur photograph of Tony in the armor, picking himself up off the\nstreet.\u00a0 The tag said <i>who is the iron man?</i>\u00a0 Some things didn\u2019t change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Some things did,\nthough.\u00a0 This woman <i>looked</i> so exactly like Pepper\u2026 but apparently in this world it was <i>her</i> doing the superheroing.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s gut wanted to tell her that she didn\u2019t\nhave \u2013 that whatever reason made her feel like she had to carry the fate of the\nworld herself, it couldn\u2019t be as bad as some of the stuff he\u2019d done, never mind\nthe stuff he <i>should</i> have done and <i>hadn\u2019t</i>.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t, though, because she might have <i>asked</i> what he\u2019d done and failed to do\u2026 and that was no way to make\nan impression on some other universe\u2019s Miss Potts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Instead,\ntherefore, they just sat there awkwardly, not looking at each other.\u00a0 Miss Potts concentrated on her phone, and\nTony kept glancing up at the television in the corner, which was playing a\ncurling match.\u00a0 Tony knew nothing about\ncurling besides a vague impression that it was cold bowling in slow motion.\u00a0 Who would have ever thought he\u2019d find himself\nnext to Pepper Potts with nothing to say to her?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI guess you\nprobably want to know the whole story,\u201d he offered.\u00a0 <i>That</i>\nwould certainly pass the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI do,\u201d she agreed\nquietly, \u201cbut I think I want to hear it from Tony.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony took\ntwo things from that \u2013 one was that she didn\u2019t trust him.\u00a0 Maybe, like his double, she assumed the beard\nmade him the evil one.\u00a0 Or maybe she was\njust generally suspicious of this man who looked exactly like her favourite employee\nexcept for being able to fly her suits.\u00a0\nMaybe she was mad because people didn\u2019t know she was Iron Woman or\nwhatever, and him appearing in the suit might have compromised that.\u00a0 He could think of all sorts of reasons,\nreally.\u00a0 Tony was just not a trustworthy\nperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">The other\nthing was that she <i>did</i> trust <i>her</i> Tony, and was very worried about his\nwelfare.\u00a0 That was a possible opening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHe cares a\nlot about you, you know,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHm?\u201d Miss\nPotts asked, looking up from her phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHim.\u00a0 Tony,\u201d he said.\u00a0 It still felt weird saying his own name and\nmeaning somebody else, even when he <i>had</i>\nmet other Tonys in the past.\u00a0 This was\ndifferent.\u00a0 \u201cHe cares a lot about you,\u201d\nhe repeated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI know,\u201d\nsaid Miss Potts, turning her phone over and looking at the ceiling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo, I mean,\nhe <i>really</i>\u2026\u201d Tony paused, rubbing the\nback of his neck.\u00a0 How did you tell\nsomebody that your alternate universe self was in love with her?\u00a0 There was no script for that.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a thing for you since you hired him,\nbut he\u2019s worried you\u2019ll think he\u2019s trespassing your boundaries\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">It was both\na frustration and a relief that a woman in scrubs chose that moment to approach\nthem.\u00a0 \u201cMs. Potts?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m\nVirginia Potts.\u201d\u00a0 Miss Potts stood,\npulling her purse strap up her shoulder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYour\nemployee has two broken ribs but he won\u2019t require surgery.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taped him up and given him some morphine,\nand we\u2019re discharging him now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cThank you,\u201d\nsaid Miss Potts, with a smile that was equal parts polite and relieved.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll take him home now.\u201d\u00a0 Then she paused as she realized something\nimportant.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t actually know where\nTony lives.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo problem,\u201d\nsaid Tony himself, happy to be able to contribute something.\u00a0 \u201cI do.\u201d</p>",

roared past the library and\nrammed into the steps to the 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue subway station, where they\ngot stuck.\u00a0 The robot grabbed Tony by the\nshoulder and lifted him to bang him against the stairs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">He was bracing\nfor the impact when somebody caught him.\u00a0\nThe red giantess ripped him out of the robot\u2019s claws and then gave the\nmachine a good hard kick.\u00a0 The railings\nbroke, and the robot went bouncing down the steps into the subway station.\u00a0 Satisfied, the giantess put Tony down gently,\nand then ran after it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony got up,\ntook a deep breath and tried to stop his ears ringing, then ran after her.\u00a0 \u201cHey!\u201d he shouted.\u00a0 What was it JANIS had called her?\u00a0 \u201cDr. Ross!\u00a0\nDr. Ross!\u00a0 Try and get a hand\nbetween those armor plates!\u201d</p><p class=\"Standard\">There weren\u2019t\na lot of people taking the number seven train at one in the morning, but half a\ndozen or so were still screaming and running for the other exit as the giantess\nand the robot grappled on the platform.\u00a0\nShe\u2019d wrapped her legs around it and was pulling at something, while it slammed\nher repeatedly into an ad for <i style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The Lion\nKing</i> on Broadway.\u00a0 Finally she lost\nher grip and dropped to the floor, apparently unconscious.\u00a0 The robot rearranged itself and picked up a\nheavy wooden bench, ready to crush her with it.</p><p></p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">But when it\nmoved, Tony saw that one of the plates was bent open, exposing a layer of\ncarbon fiber weave inside.\u00a0 <i>Good</i>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony ran up\nand blasted the bench out of its arms with a repulsor.\u00a0 It went flying and landed across the\ntrack.\u00a0 \u201cHere I am!\u00a0 Come and get me!\u201d Tony ordered.\u00a0 He jumped down to the track, and kicked the\nbench aside.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">The robot\nhad taken quite a bit of damage on the trip down 42<sup>nd</sup>.\u00a0 Some of its joints were sparking and one leg\nwas dragging, but it crawled towards him gamely enough, rotating the damaged\nportion away from him.\u00a0 As it scuttled down\nonto the tracks, Tony fired his thrusters just hard enough to somersault over it\nand grab the exposed fibers with both hands.\u00a0\nUpon landing, he brought his boots down on the third rail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Carbon fiber\ndidn\u2019t burn, but it <i>did</i> conduct\nelectricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Nearly seven\nhundred volts crackled over the skin of the suit, and passed across the\ngauntlets into the robot\u2019s interior.\u00a0 The\nmesh built in kept the current from reaching Tony\u2019s body, but the HUD turned to\nstatic and the servos seized, locking Tony in one place.\u00a0 A moment later the display flickered back to\nlife, but the lights were out in the subway station.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cJANIS,\nswitch to night vision,\u201d he ordered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\"><i>We don\u2019t have that</i>, the computer said.\u00a0 <i>Would\nyou like the flashlight?</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes,\u201d said\nTony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\"><i>Yes, what?</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, <i>please</i>,\u201d he groaned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">A light came\non in the suit\u2019s chest, and fell on the remains of the robot, smoking and twitching\non the tracks in front of Tony.\u00a0 He gave\nit a kick to be sure it wasn\u2019t faking, but it did not respond.\u00a0 Apparently they\u2019d beaten it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Satisfied of\nthat, Tony climbed back onto the platform to look for the giantess.\u00a0 There was no sign of her at first, which left\nhim wondering how an eight-foot red woman just disappeared.\u00a0 Then, however, he saw the shape lying\nhalf-conscious below the <i>Lion King</i>\nad.\u00a0 She was of perfectly normal stature\nand had fair Caucasian skin, but she was wearing the black sports bra and bike\nshorts, both stretched out a bit too big for her.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony held\nout a gauntleted hand to her.\u00a0 \u201cDr. Ross?\u201d\nhe asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">She took his\nhand and was coughing as he helped her up..\u00a0\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known I was coming back to this,\u201d she said, \u201cI would have stayed\nin Canada.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cAre you\nhurt?\u201d Tony wanted to know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d she scoffed, and although she looked rather haggard and exhausted, she\ndidn\u2019t seem to be bleeding.\u00a0 She was\ncertainly able to stand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cAll right,\u201d\nhe said.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the building.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">There were\nnow a dozen police cars, as well as fire trucks and ambulances, surrounding the\nentrance to Grand Central Station.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s\ncounterpart was not in evidence, but there was a woman hurrying down the\nsteps.\u00a0 Tony recognized her at once.\u00a0 How could he not?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">This was it,\nthen.\u00a0 He was about to meet this world\u2019s\nPepper Potts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">She wore her\nhair short, which made sense.\u00a0 Long hair\nwould easily get tangled in the inner workings of the suit.\u00a0 And she was dressed in jogging clothes \u2013 a pair\nof yoga pants and one of those wicking shirts.\u00a0\nWhen she saw Tony and Dr. Ross, she stopped short on the bottom\nstep.\u00a0 Her eyes flicked from one to the other,\nas if she couldn\u2019t decide which of them she was more astonished to see.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cBetty!\u00a0 Are you all right?\u201d she asked, running to\nmeet them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d\nDr. Ross replied.\u00a0 Tony handed her off to\nMiss Potts, who helped the other woman sit down on the steps and wrapped her\nown jacket around her.\u00a0 The EMTs started\nto approach, but Dr. Ross shook her head, and Miss Potts waved them away.\u00a0 She sat with her a while longer, and then got\nup to confront Tony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony,\u201d she\nsaid, coming up to look him in the eye.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\nin the world is going <i>on</i>?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Yeah, that\nwas Pepper Potts, all right.\u00a0 Tony held his\nhands up.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not Tony,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Miss Potts\npaused and looked him over, taking in the beard and the fact that he was\nwearing the suit, and nodded slowly.\u00a0 \u201cThen\nwho are you?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cThat\u2019s his\ncousin!\u201d another voice panted, and Beth the security guard arrived.\u00a0 She was now wearing a leather jacket over a knee-length\nblack dress covered in sequins \u2013 she must have been out somewhere, only for the\nrobot fight to get her attention when she realized it was at her\nworkplace.\u00a0 She was out of breath and\nrunning awkwardly in her high heeled shoes.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s his cousin Arno.\u00a0 From\nItaly,\u201d she said, as she stopped to catch her breath.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Miss Potts\nbit her lip and looked Tony over.\u00a0 \u201cBullshit,\u201d\nshe declared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cEvery word,\u201d\nTony agreed with a nervous chuckle.\u00a0 \u201cLook,\nwe\u2019ll explain, but I gotta make sure he\u2019s okay first.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cMake sure\nwho\u2019s okay?\u201d Miss Potts asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony,\u201d said\nTony, feeling stupid saying it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Several\nexpressions crossed her face, including cynicism, an urge to laugh, and anger,\nand then she settled on curiosity.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m\ncoming with you,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cMs. Cabe,\ncan you look after Betty, please?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI don\u2019t need\nlooking after,\u201d Dr. Ross complained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cOf course,\nMiss Potts,\u201d said Beth, and sat down beside Dr. Ross.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony had\nleft his double by the ticket counters.\u00a0\nWith the suit on it was very awkward to climb over and through the\nrubble to get back to him, but Tony felt unwilling to take it off.\u00a0 That robot had come out of nowhere, and who\nknew what might prompt a second one to materialize.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYou\u2019re the\none who phoned me the other day,\u201d Miss Potts said, picking her way through the\nwreckage behind him with far more grace.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you the one who shut down the suits?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, but it\u2019s\nkind of a long story,\u201d said Tony.\u00a0 He\nheaved himself up on the counter, and looked down.\u00a0 There was his double, curled up and grimacing\nin pain.\u00a0 \u201cFound him!\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony!\u201d\u00a0 Miss Potts climbed over the counter and\ndropped down next to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m\nfine,\u201d said the other, holding up a hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo, you\u2019re\nnot,\u201d said Miss Potts.\u00a0 \u201cBut you will\nbe.\u00a0 Arno, go get the EMTs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">It took Tony\na moment to realize that by \u2018Arno\u2019 she meant him.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t given her another name to call\nhim.\u00a0 \u201cOn my way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Circumstances\nbeing what they were, he waited until he was out of the suit and the two of\nthem were sitting in a hospital waiting room while his counterpart\u2019s ribs got\nx-rayed before he said, \u201cmy name isn\u2019t Arno, by the way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI didn\u2019t\nthink it was,\u201d Miss Potts replied, nervously fiddling with her phone.\u00a0 She was scrolling through news websites too\nfast to actually read them\u2026 she must be looking at the pictures and taking in\nthe sound bites instead.\u00a0 There were\nimages of the destruction around Grand Central, a blurry cell phone photo of\nDr. Ross and the robot up on the Chrysler Building, and a clearer but still\namateur photograph of Tony in the armor, picking himself up off the\nstreet.\u00a0 The tag said <i>who is the iron man?</i>\u00a0 Some things didn\u2019t change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Some things did,\nthough.\u00a0 This woman <i>looked</i> so exactly like Pepper\u2026 but apparently in this world it was <i>her</i> doing the superheroing.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s gut wanted to tell her that she didn\u2019t\nhave \u2013 that whatever reason made her feel like she had to carry the fate of the\nworld herself, it couldn\u2019t be as bad as some of the stuff he\u2019d done, never mind\nthe stuff he <i>should</i> have done and <i>hadn\u2019t</i>.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t, though, because she might have <i>asked</i> what he\u2019d done and failed to do\u2026 and that was no way to make\nan impression on some other universe\u2019s Miss Potts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Instead,\ntherefore, they just sat there awkwardly, not looking at each other.\u00a0 Miss Potts concentrated on her phone, and\nTony kept glancing up at the television in the corner, which was playing a\ncurling match.\u00a0 Tony knew nothing about\ncurling besides a vague impression that it was cold bowling in slow motion.\u00a0 Who would have ever thought he\u2019d find himself\nnext to Pepper Potts with nothing to say to her?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI guess you\nprobably want to know the whole story,\u201d he offered.\u00a0 <i>That</i>\nwould certainly pass the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI do,\u201d she agreed\nquietly, \u201cbut I think I want to hear it from Tony.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony took\ntwo things from that \u2013 one was that she didn\u2019t trust him.\u00a0 Maybe, like his double, she assumed the beard\nmade him the evil one.\u00a0 Or maybe she was\njust generally suspicious of this man who looked exactly like her favourite employee\nexcept for being able to fly her suits.\u00a0\nMaybe she was mad because people didn\u2019t know she was Iron Woman or\nwhatever, and him appearing in the suit might have compromised that.\u00a0 He could think of all sorts of reasons,\nreally.\u00a0 Tony was just not a trustworthy\nperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">The other\nthing was that she <i>did</i> trust <i>her</i> Tony, and was very worried about his\nwelfare.\u00a0 That was a possible opening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHe cares a\nlot about you, you know,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHm?\u201d Miss\nPotts asked, looking up from her phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHim.\u00a0 Tony,\u201d he said.\u00a0 It still felt weird saying his own name and\nmeaning somebody else, even when he <i>had</i>\nmet other Tonys in the past.\u00a0 This was\ndifferent.\u00a0 \u201cHe cares a lot about you,\u201d\nhe repeated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI know,\u201d\nsaid Miss Potts, turning her phone over and looking at the ceiling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo, I mean,\nhe <i>really</i>\u2026\u201d Tony paused, rubbing the\nback of his neck.\u00a0 How did you tell\nsomebody that your alternate universe self was in love with her?\u00a0 There was no script for that.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a thing for you since you hired him,\nbut he\u2019s worried you\u2019ll think he\u2019s trespassing your boundaries\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">It was both\na frustration and a relief that a woman in scrubs chose that moment to approach\nthem.\u00a0 \u201cMs. Potts?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m\nVirginia Potts.\u201d\u00a0 Miss Potts stood,\npulling her purse strap up her shoulder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYour\nemployee has two broken ribs but he won\u2019t require surgery.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taped him up and given him some morphine,\nand we\u2019re discharging him now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cThank you,\u201d\nsaid Miss Potts, with a smile that was equal parts polite and relieved.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll take him home now.\u201d\u00a0 Then she paused as she realized something\nimportant.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t actually know where\nTony lives.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo problem,\u201d\nsaid Tony himself, happy to be able to contribute something.\u00a0 \u201cI do.\u201d</p></p>",

giantess.\u00a0 There was no sign of her at first, which left\nhim wondering how an eight-foot red woman just disappeared.\u00a0 Then, however, he saw the shape lying\nhalf-conscious below the <i>Lion

know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cOf course\nnot,\u201d she scoffed, and although she looked rather haggard and exhausted, she\ndidn\u2019t seem to be bleeding.\u00a0 She was\ncertainly able to stand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cAll right,\u201d\nhe said.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the building.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">There were\nnow a dozen police cars, as well as fire trucks and ambulances, surrounding the\nentrance to Grand Central Station.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s\ncounterpart was not in evidence, but there was a woman hurrying down the\nsteps.\u00a0 Tony recognized her at once.\u00a0 How could he not?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">This was it,\nthen.\u00a0 He was about to meet this world\u2019s\nPepper Potts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">She wore her\nhair short, which made sense.\u00a0 Long hair\nwould easily get tangled in the inner workings of the suit.\u00a0 And she was dressed in jogging clothes \u2013 a pair\nof yoga pants and one of those wicking shirts.\u00a0\nWhen she saw Tony and Dr. Ross, she stopped short on the bottom\nstep.\u00a0 Her eyes flicked from one to the other,\nas if she couldn\u2019t decide which of them she was more astonished to see.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cBetty!\u00a0 Are you all right?\u201d she asked, running to\nmeet them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d\nDr. Ross replied.\u00a0 Tony handed her off to\nMiss Potts, who helped the other woman sit down on the steps and wrapped her\nown jacket around her.\u00a0 The EMTs started\nto approach, but Dr. Ross shook her head, and Miss Potts waved them away.\u00a0 She sat with her a while longer, and then got\nup to confront Tony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony,\u201d she\nsaid, coming up to look him in the eye.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\nin the world is going <i>on</i>?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Yeah, that\nwas Pepper Potts, all right.\u00a0 Tony held his\nhands up.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not Tony,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Miss Potts\npaused and looked him over, taking in the beard and the fact that he was\nwearing the suit, and nodded slowly.\u00a0 \u201cThen\nwho are you?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cThat\u2019s his\ncousin!\u201d another voice panted, and Beth the security guard arrived.\u00a0 She was now wearing a leather jacket over a knee-length\nblack dress covered in sequins \u2013 she must have been out somewhere, only for the\nrobot fight to get her attention when she realized it was at her\nworkplace.\u00a0 She was out of breath and\nrunning awkwardly in her high heeled shoes.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s his cousin Arno.\u00a0 From\nItaly,\u201d she said, as she stopped to catch her breath.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Miss Potts\nbit her lip and looked Tony over.\u00a0 \u201cBullshit,\u201d\nshe declared.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cEvery word,\u201d\nTony agreed with a nervous chuckle.\u00a0 \u201cLook,\nwe\u2019ll explain, but I gotta make sure he\u2019s okay first.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cMake sure\nwho\u2019s okay?\u201d Miss Potts asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony,\u201d said\nTony, feeling stupid saying it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Several\nexpressions crossed her face, including cynicism, an urge to laugh, and anger,\nand then she settled on curiosity.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m\ncoming with you,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cMs. Cabe,\ncan you look after Betty, please?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI don\u2019t need\nlooking after,\u201d Dr. Ross complained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cOf course,\nMiss Potts,\u201d said Beth, and sat down beside Dr. Ross.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony had\nleft his double by the ticket counters.\u00a0\nWith the suit on it was very awkward to climb over and through the\nrubble to get back to him, but Tony felt unwilling to take it off.\u00a0 That robot had come out of nowhere, and who\nknew what might prompt a second one to materialize.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYou\u2019re the\none who phoned me the other day,\u201d Miss Potts said, picking her way through the\nwreckage behind him with far more grace.\u00a0\n\u201cAre you the one who shut down the suits?\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, but it\u2019s\nkind of a long story,\u201d said Tony.\u00a0 He\nheaved himself up on the counter, and looked down.\u00a0 There was his double, curled up and grimacing\nin pain.\u00a0 \u201cFound him!\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cTony!\u201d\u00a0 Miss Potts climbed over the counter and\ndropped down next to him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m\nfine,\u201d said the other, holding up a hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo, you\u2019re\nnot,\u201d said Miss Potts.\u00a0 \u201cBut you will\nbe.\u00a0 Arno, go get the EMTs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">It took Tony\na moment to realize that by \u2018Arno\u2019 she meant him.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t given her another name to call\nhim.\u00a0 \u201cOn my way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Circumstances\nbeing what they were, he waited until he was out of the suit and the two of\nthem were sitting in a hospital waiting room while his counterpart\u2019s ribs got\nx-rayed before he said, \u201cmy name isn\u2019t Arno, by the way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI didn\u2019t\nthink it was,\u201d Miss Potts replied, nervously fiddling with her phone.\u00a0 She was scrolling through news websites too\nfast to actually read them\u2026 she must be looking at the pictures and taking in\nthe sound bites instead.\u00a0 There were\nimages of the destruction around Grand Central, a blurry cell phone photo of\nDr. Ross and the robot up on the Chrysler Building, and a clearer but still\namateur photograph of Tony in the armor, picking himself up off the\nstreet.\u00a0 The tag said <i>who is the iron man?</i>\u00a0 Some things didn\u2019t change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Some things did,\nthough.\u00a0 This woman <i>looked</i> so exactly like Pepper\u2026 but apparently in this world it was <i>her</i> doing the superheroing.\u00a0 Tony\u2019s gut wanted to tell her that she didn\u2019t\nhave \u2013 that whatever reason made her feel like she had to carry the fate of the\nworld herself, it couldn\u2019t be as bad as some of the stuff he\u2019d done, never mind\nthe stuff he <i>should</i> have done and <i>hadn\u2019t</i>.\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t, though, because she might have <i>asked</i> what he\u2019d done and failed to do\u2026 and that was no way to make\nan impression on some other universe\u2019s Miss Potts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Instead,\ntherefore, they just sat there awkwardly, not looking at each other.\u00a0 Miss Potts concentrated on her phone, and\nTony kept glancing up at the television in the corner, which was playing a\ncurling match.\u00a0 Tony knew nothing about\ncurling besides a vague impression that it was cold bowling in slow motion.\u00a0 Who would have ever thought he\u2019d find himself\nnext to Pepper Potts with nothing to say to her?</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI guess you\nprobably want to know the whole story,\u201d he offered.\u00a0 <i>That</i>\nwould certainly pass the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI do,\u201d she agreed\nquietly, \u201cbut I think I want to hear it from Tony.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">Tony took\ntwo things from that \u2013 one was that she didn\u2019t trust him.\u00a0 Maybe, like his double, she assumed the beard\nmade him the evil one.\u00a0 Or maybe she was\njust generally suspicious of this man who looked exactly like her favourite employee\nexcept for being able to fly her suits.\u00a0\nMaybe she was mad because people didn\u2019t know she was Iron Woman or\nwhatever, and him appearing in the suit might have compromised that.\u00a0 He could think of all sorts of reasons,\nreally.\u00a0 Tony was just not a trustworthy\nperson.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">The other\nthing was that she <i>did</i> trust <i>her</i> Tony, and was very worried about his\nwelfare.\u00a0 That was a possible opening.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHe cares a\nlot about you, you know,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHm?\u201d Miss\nPotts asked, looking up from her phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cHim.\u00a0 Tony,\u201d he said.\u00a0 It still felt weird saying his own name and\nmeaning somebody else, even when he <i>had</i>\nmet other Tonys in the past.\u00a0 This was\ndifferent.\u00a0 \u201cHe cares a lot about you,\u201d\nhe repeated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cI know,\u201d\nsaid Miss Potts, turning her phone over and looking at the ceiling.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo, I mean,\nhe <i>really</i>\u2026\u201d Tony paused, rubbing the\nback of his neck.\u00a0 How did you tell\nsomebody that your alternate universe self was in love with her?\u00a0 There was no script for that.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s had a thing for you since you hired him,\nbut he\u2019s worried you\u2019ll think he\u2019s trespassing your boundaries\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">It was both\na frustration and a relief that a woman in scrubs chose that moment to approach\nthem.\u00a0 \u201cMs. Potts?\u201d she asked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYes, I\u2019m\nVirginia Potts.\u201d\u00a0 Miss Potts stood,\npulling her purse strap up her shoulder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cYour\nemployee has two broken ribs but he won\u2019t require surgery.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taped him up and given him some morphine,\nand we\u2019re discharging him now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cThank you,\u201d\nsaid Miss Potts, with a smile that was equal parts polite and relieved.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll take him home now.\u201d\u00a0 Then she paused as she realized something\nimportant.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t actually know where\nTony lives.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"Standard\">\u201cNo problem,\u201d\nsaid Tony himself, happy to be able to contribute something.\u00a0 \u201cI do.\u201d</p></p>",

she must have been out somewhere, only for the\nrobot fight to get her attention when she realized it was at her\nworkplace.&nbsp; She was out of breath and\nrunning awkwardly in her high heeled shoes.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his cousin Arno.&nbsp; From\nItaly,&rdquo; she said, as she stopped to catch her breath.</p>\n\n<p>Miss Potts\nbit her lip and looked Tony over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bullshit,&rdquo;\nshe declared.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Every word,&rdquo;\nTony agreed with a nervous chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look,\nwe&rsquo;ll explain, but I gotta make sure he&rsquo;s okay first.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Make sure\nwho&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo; Miss Potts asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; said\nTony, feeling stupid saying it.</p>\n\n<p>Several\nexpressions crossed her face, including cynicism, an urge to laugh, and anger,\nand then she settled on curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ncoming with you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ms. Cabe,\ncan you look after Betty, please?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need\nlooking after,&rdquo; Dr. Ross complained.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Of course,\nMiss Potts,&rdquo; said Beth, and sat down beside Dr. Ross.</p>\n\n<p>Tony had\nleft his double by the ticket counters.&nbsp;\nWith the suit on it was very awkward to climb over and through the\nrubble to get back to him, but Tony felt unwilling to take it off.&nbsp; That robot had come out of nowhere, and who\nknew what might prompt a second one to materialize.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the\none who phoned me the other day,&rdquo; Miss Potts said, picking her way through the\nwreckage behind him with far more grace.&nbsp;\n&ldquo;Are you the one who shut down the suits?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s\nkind of a long story,&rdquo; said Tony.&nbsp; He\nheaved himself up on the counter, and looked down.&nbsp; There was his double, curled up and grimacing\nin pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Found him!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Potts climbed over the counter and\ndropped down next to him.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m\nfine,&rdquo; said the other, holding up a hand.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re\nnot,&rdquo; said Miss Potts.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you will\nbe.&nbsp; Arno, go get the EMTs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It took Tony\na moment to realize that by &lsquo;Arno&rsquo; she meant him.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t given her another name to call\nhim.&nbsp; &ldquo;On my way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Circumstances\nbeing what they were, he waited until he was out of the suit and the two of\nthem were sitting in a hospital waiting room while his counterpart&rsquo;s ribs got\nx-rayed before he said, &ldquo;my name isn&rsquo;t Arno, by the way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t\nthink it was,&rdquo; Miss Potts replied, nervously fiddling with her phone.&nbsp; She was scrolling through news websites too\nfast to actually read them&hellip; she must be looking at the pictures and taking in\nthe sound bites instead.&nbsp; There were\nimages of the destruction around Grand Central, a blurry cell phone photo of\nDr. Ross and the robot up on the Chrysler Building, and a clearer but still\namateur photograph of Tony in the armor, picking himself up off the\nstreet.&nbsp; The tag said <i>who is the iron man?</i>&nbsp; Some things didn&rsquo;t change.</p>\n\n<p>Some things did,\nthough.&nbsp; This woman <i>looked</i> so exactly like Pepper&hellip; but apparently in this world it was <i>her</i> doing the superheroing.&nbsp; Tony&rsquo;s gut wanted to tell her that she didn&rsquo;t\nhave &ndash; that whatever reason made her feel like she had to carry the fate of the\nworld herself, it couldn&rsquo;t be as bad as some of the stuff he&rsquo;d done, never mind\nthe stuff he <i>should</i> have done and <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i>.&nbsp;\nHe didn&rsquo;t, though, because she might have <i>asked</i> what he&rsquo;d done and failed to do&hellip; and that was no way to make\nan impression on some other universe&rsquo;s Miss Potts.</p>\n\n<p>Instead,\ntherefore, they just sat there awkwardly, not looking at each other.&nbsp; Miss Potts concentrated on her phone, and\nTony kept glancing up at the television in the corner, which was playing a\ncurling match.&nbsp; Tony knew nothing about\ncurling besides a vague impression that it was cold bowling in slow motion.&nbsp; Who would have ever thought he&rsquo;d find himself\nnext to Pepper Potts with nothing to say to her?</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I guess you\nprobably want to know the whole story,&rdquo; he offered.&nbsp; <i>That</i>\nwould certainly pass the time.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she agreed\nquietly, &ldquo;but I think I want to hear it from Tony.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tony took\ntwo things from that &ndash; one was that she didn&rsquo;t trust him.&nbsp; Maybe, like his double, she assumed the beard\nmade him the evil one.&nbsp; Or maybe she was\njust generally suspicious of this man who looked exactly like her favourite employee\nexcept for being able to fly her suits.&nbsp;\nMaybe she was mad because people didn&rsquo;t know she was Iron Woman or\nwhatever, and him appearing in the suit might have compromised that.&nbsp; He could think of all sorts of reasons,\nreally.&nbsp; Tony was just not a trustworthy\nperson.</p>\n\n<p>The other\nthing was that she <i>did</i> trust <i>her</i> Tony, and was very worried about his\nwelfare.&nbsp; That was a possible opening.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He cares a\nlot about you, you know,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Miss\nPotts asked, looking up from her phone.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Him.&nbsp; Tony,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; It still felt weird saying his own name and\nmeaning somebody else, even when he <i>had</i>\nmet other Tonys in the past.&nbsp; This was\ndifferent.&nbsp; &ldquo;He cares a lot about you,&rdquo;\nhe repeated.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo;\nsaid Miss Potts, turning her phone over and looking at the ceiling.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, I mean,\nhe <i>really</i>&hellip;&rdquo; Tony paused, rubbing the\nback of his neck.&nbsp; How did you tell\nsomebody that your alternate universe self was in love with her?&nbsp; There was no script for that.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had a thing for you since you hired him,\nbut he&rsquo;s worried you&rsquo;ll think he&rsquo;s trespassing your boundaries&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It was both\na frustration and a relief that a woman in scrubs chose that moment to approach\nthem.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ms. Potts?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m\nVirginia Potts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Potts stood,\npulling her purse strap up her shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Your\nemployee has two broken ribs but he won&rsquo;t require surgery.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve taped him up and given him some morphine,\nand we&rsquo;re discharging him now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;\nsaid Miss Potts, with a smile that was equal parts polite and relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him home now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she paused as she realized something\nimportant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t actually know where\nTony lives.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo;\nsaid Tony himself, happy to be able to contribute something.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p></p>",
