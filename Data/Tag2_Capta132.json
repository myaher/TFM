        "body": "<p>When seeing previews for <i>The Last Jedi</i>, I never thought how much of a mess that movie would turn out to be. Granted, it was good overall, but really managed to disappoint me and become so&hellip; cliched&hellip;</p><p>Marvel Studios\u2019 <i>Captain Marvel</i> may turn in the same fate. But previews have already given a majority of people the same fleeting feeling that this film is going to just go for an agenda, much like the Star Wars franchise has. For this analysis, I\u2019ve been looking into Wikipedia for information on what this movie has to offer. I may go off on a tangent or two, so please forgive me if I do.</p><p>The first issue fans have with this soon-to-be film is its lead actress, Brie Larson. Brie is an Oscar-winning actress, but even with accolades, she\u2019s still prone to faults. Recently, news has come out that she took the role of Carol Danvers as a form of being an activist, which I don\u2019t think sends the right message to fans. I mean, it shouldn\u2019t just be a job, but it also shouldn\u2019t directly influencing viewers. Brie\u2019s also made headlines for wanting more diversity in critics. Okay, that\u2019s fine and all&hellip; but basically calling out white men as the majority and saying there\u2019s too much? Is that really what you want to do?\u00a0</p><p>Brie, I haven\u2019t seen many movies with you, but I think this is the wrong move. You\u2019re demonizing the guys who are going to watch your movie because it\u2019s supposed to be this blockbuster epic. On top of that, it\u2019ll only make things worse by the time the first reviews come around.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless of the outcome of reviews, I\u2019m still seeing this movie. One, I want to continue seeing how the Marvel Cinematic Universe expands from this. And two, I just love seeing superhero movies in general. So Brie Larson\u2019s activism doesn\u2019t turn me away, but it does for others. And I can totally understand their points.</p><p>Right now, the film is tracking for $100+ million on opening weekend. That\u2019s not bad at all, but definitely lower than earlier projections had cited around $160 million. The film\u2019s budget of $159 million will surely be met. Now the problem becomes what will fans take away from this. People are already boycotting this movie because of what agenda it\u2019s bringing. It hasn\u2019t even come out yet.\u00a0</p><p>Say what you will about <i>The Last Jedi</i>, but I barely saw any form of anger towards pandering and activism when trailers were coming around. So why now? Is it because we can no longer trust Disney to do right by these kinds of films? Well considering that <i>Black Panther</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, and <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> did reasonably well at the box office, I\u2019d say Disney was doing fine with their Marvel properties.</p><p>And thus brings us to the problem: Promoting a woman who turns out to be a superhero instead of a superhero who turns out to be a woman. Let\u2019s face it, Carol Danvers is not exactly a beloved Marvel character&hellip; at least from what I\u2019ve seen and read. But of course, people can warm to the character if they\u2019re given something inspiring and not something that panders to certain audiences.</p><p>What we have here with <i>Captain Marvel</i> is Brie Larson playing the role of an activist, not a superhero. And that\u2019s what seems to be the problem. If Brie took the role with the goal in mind to become Carol Danvers rather than become an activist, I think there would be a different consensus amongst those in the fandom. Tone down the rhetoric, be a hero on screen and inspire people through your movie rather than just telling us that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. It ruins the fun for people. And&hellip; it might ruin the fun for me, too.</p><p>Huh&hellip; Hopefully, the trailers were just there for show and not in the final product. There were questionable lines, weird CGI issues, and some other nitpicks. But there will be good stuff in this movie. There\u2019s so much more than just Brie Larson. We have Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, Jude Law, Gemma Chan, and so many more talented actors and actresses.</p><p>Plus, I\u2019m already impressed with the makeup and digital de-aging effects. The Skrulls look amazing. Though&hellip; something about them seems off without the black parts atop their heads&hellip; Eh, another nitpick. Anyways, the movie should be fun enough. Looking forward to March, everyone!</p>",

So Brie Larson\u2019s activism doesn\u2019t turn me away, but it does for others. And I can totally understand their points.</p><p>Right now, the film is tracking for $100+ million on opening weekend. That\u2019s not bad at all, but definitely lower than earlier projections had cited around $160 million. The film\u2019s budget of $159 million will surely be met. Now the problem becomes what will fans take away from this. People are already boycotting this movie because of what agenda it\u2019s bringing. It hasn\u2019t even come out yet.\u00a0</p><p>Say what you will about <i>The Last Jedi</i>, but I barely saw any form of anger towards pandering and activism when trailers were coming around. So why now? Is it because we can no longer trust Disney to do right by these kinds of films? Well considering that <i>Black Panther</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, and <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> did reasonably well at the box office, I\u2019d say Disney was doing fine with their Marvel properties.</p><p>And thus brings us to the problem: Promoting a woman who turns out to be a superhero instead of a superhero who turns out to be a woman. Let\u2019s face it, Carol Danvers is not exactly a beloved Marvel character\u2026 at least from what I\u2019ve seen and read. But of course, people can warm to the character if they\u2019re given something inspiring and not something that panders to certain audiences.</p><p>What we have here with <i>Captain Marvel</i> is Brie Larson playing the role of an activist, not a superhero. And that\u2019s what seems to be the problem. If Brie took the role with the goal in mind to become Carol Danvers rather than become an activist, I think there would be a different consensus amongst those in the fandom. Tone down the rhetoric, be a hero on screen and inspire people through your movie rather than just telling us that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. It ruins the fun for people. And\u2026 it might ruin the fun for me, too.</p><p>Huh\u2026 Hopefully, the trailers were just there for show and not in the final product. There were questionable lines, weird CGI issues, and some other nitpicks. But there will be good stuff in this movie. There\u2019s so much more than just Brie Larson. We have Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, Jude Law, Gemma Chan, and so many more talented actors and actresses.</p><p>Plus, I\u2019m already impressed with the makeup and digital de-aging effects. The Skrulls look amazing. Though\u2026 something about them seems off without the black parts atop their heads\u2026 Eh, another nitpick. Anyways, the movie should be fun enough. Looking forward to March, everyone!</p>",

I\u2019m hoping this will help me speed up my drawing a little and to draw some of the characters I don\u2019t think i\u2019d have a chance to draw otherwise.
