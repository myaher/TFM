                "content": "<p>In season 6 of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, we see Jon Snow crowned King in the North. This scene, although the circumstances are different, is reminiscent of his believed half&nbsp;brother&rsquo;s crowning in season 1, episode 10. &nbsp;Robb Stark&rsquo;s Kingship ended with his own murder and horrific tragedy for his family. &nbsp;He lost his Mother, wife, unborn child, thousands of men and his Direwolf when the Starks were betrayed at the Red Wedding. &nbsp;The reasons for the massacre at the Red Wedding are directly attributable to an earlier decision by Robb to marry Talisa. &nbsp;Although the plot was hatched by Tywin Lannister, Walder Frey staged the Red Wedding because Robb had broken the marriage pact between himself and one of Frey&rsquo;s daughters. &nbsp;The pact had been brokered by Catelyn Stark in exchange for the Stark forces being allowed to cross at the Green Fork during the War of the Five Kings.</p><p>The massacre at the Red Wedding was a profound loss for House Stark which almost lead to it being completely wiped out. &nbsp;Winterfell and the Stark name were eventually restored only because Sansa Stark and Jon Snow defeated the Boltons at the Battle of the Bastards. &nbsp;Currently on <i>Game of Thrones</i>, the Starks finally have a chance to replenish their dynasty, which had been thought by many Northern Lords to be&nbsp;&ldquo;dead&rdquo;. &nbsp;Because of the Stark&rsquo;s victory, Jon Snow, the supposed bastard son of Ned Stark, was named King in the North, as was Robb before him. &nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c51c2c483070e96750c008fe81bb3ea8/tumblr_inline_poh9x010Fx1wx65bx_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>During the time when Sansa and Jon are attempting to gain support from Northern houses to take back Winterfell, we hear sentiments expressed about Robb Stark by Lord Glover. &nbsp;Glover refuses to support their cause and declares Hose Stark&nbsp;&ldquo;dead&rdquo; because of Robb&rsquo;s &nbsp;mistake of&nbsp;&ldquo;taking up with a foreign whore&rdquo;. &nbsp;This feeling is no doubt shared by many other Northerners, who view Robb as having been foolish and naive. &nbsp;Later, in season 7, Sansa alludes to Jon about Robb&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;stupid mistake&rdquo;. &nbsp;This mistake can be none other than his choice to break his oath to the Freys which lead to thousands of deaths and the near total eradication of the Stark name. &nbsp;Sansa&rsquo;a advice to Jon Snow is that he has to be smarter and avoid making these kinds of mistakes. The central&nbsp;&ldquo;mistake&rdquo; of Robb was to disregard his responsibilities and honor as King by breaking the marriage pact he had agreed to with the Freys. &nbsp;Not only did Robb go back on his word, his actions lead to thousands of deaths and the victory of the Lannisters. &nbsp;The implication of Sansa and Lord Glover&rsquo;s words is that Robb&rsquo;s decision to marry for love was foolish and irresponsible.</p><p>When Sansa tells Jon that he needs to be smarter, the two don&rsquo;t specifically discuss what Robb actually did, but the foreshadowing of Jon&rsquo;s future context is clear. &nbsp;Robb&rsquo;s downfall occurred because he followed his heart instead of doing his duty as a King by keeping his word. &nbsp;Although Jon Snow&rsquo;s situation with Daenerys is not identical, there are important parallels. &nbsp;Robb jeopardized and ultimately lost his life and his title, thereby destroying the Northern claim, by making the rash decision to marry Talissa. &nbsp;It literally cost him everything and thousands of his men were killed. &nbsp;This is why Sansa called it a stupid mistake. &nbsp;Although a case can be made that Jon&rsquo;s decision to forgive the Umbers and the Karstarks was the right one, Sansa is no doubt thinking of other things that Jon has done when she counsels him. &nbsp;Jon went against Sansa&rsquo;s advice regarding the number of men needed to attack the Bolton&rsquo;s, and he also fell into Ramsay&rsquo;s trap by charging at him during the Battle of the Bastards. &nbsp;The show is sending a message that Jon could be about to make more mistakes, just like Robb, and the mistakes could be related to acting on emotion rather than using logic. &nbsp;They could also be related to behaving selfishly instead of keeping the greater good in mind. &nbsp;</p><p>Although the audience does not get a window into Jon Snow&rsquo;s thought processes with regard to Daenerys in season 7, he at first refuses to bend the knee to her when she demands it of him. &nbsp;His reasons include the foundations of her claim (based upon her father&rsquo;s claim) and his sense that the North would not submit to her. &nbsp;Indeed he was specifically warned about the Targaryens before he departed for Dragonstone. &nbsp;Jon would like to get Dany&rsquo;s support and to be able to receive her dragonglass, but not at the cost of bending the knee. &nbsp;He would like an alliance, but not one which involves submitting the North to a Targaryen.</p><p>Eventually, Jon does submit to her as Queen, and his problem upon returning home is going to be how this will be received by the Northern Lords and Jon&rsquo;s own family. &nbsp;Once the nature of his relationship with Dany becomes known, there will be protestations that he has taken up with a foreign woman in the same manner as Robb Stark. &nbsp;The implication will be similar: &nbsp;Jon is rashly giving away the North &nbsp;in order to follow his heart. &nbsp;The central question for the audience is whether Jon is making a stupid mistake or if he is actually behaving rationally.&nbsp;The answer to this question will perhaps rest upon whether Dany makes the difference against the Night King. &nbsp;In this case, Jon&rsquo;s bending the knee may garner support from Northerners.&nbsp; However, if Cersei is going to attack from the South with the Golden Company and the North suffers heavy losses anyway, Jon will likely be blamed for bending the knee to Dany and thus exposing the North.</p><p>As of yet in the series, Jon Snow is unaware of his true parentage. Out of his sense of himself as a Stark and a Northerner he believes (whether he loves Dany or not), that he is doing what has to be done against a massive existential threat. &nbsp;In light of the new trailer, it looks as though Sansa and the other key players in the show will have to accept Dany&rsquo;s support for the battle against the Night King and the Whitewalkers. This battle is going to happen in episode 3, so the remainder of the show is going to be concerned with the aftermath and the consequences of Jon&rsquo;s alliance in the context of a probable attack from Cersei and the parentage reveal. &nbsp;</p>",
