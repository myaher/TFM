I loved it &lt;3</p><p>Konstantin actually went to Eve and Carolyn for help after telling them that Villanelle was after him. It ended up not doing him too much good, as he still got shot and killed by her and in a public place too. I was sad about that, even if she was contracted to kill him, I thought maybe he was too important to her for her to want to kill him and I was actually bitterly disappointed by the betrayal. Although, I guess maybe it was because of how had acted towards her in the end and taking her off assignments that made her not be so bothered by it. I know she\u2019s a psychopath but she did seem to quite like his company, even going as far earlier in the series to give him a birthday party and dress up like him for it. I also really liked Konstantin as a character, he was very interesting to watch and Kim Bodnia played him perfectly. He was funny and caring and a good handler for Villanelle and had all the other stuff going on with the 12, along with these complex relationships with everyone.</p><p>Villanelle was on the run for most of the episode and appeared to kill Konstantin then Eve went to to finally see where Villanelle lived only to have her turn up whilst she was there.\u00a0</p><p>This was after she was fired from her job at MI6 but the girl she asked to track down Villanelle had already found her Parisian apartment and called to tell her about so of course she had to go, but she probably didn\u2019t bargain on bumping in to her.</p><p>I really quite liked their scenes where they were bonding and telling each other how they were obsessed with the other as they intrigued each other so much. They are both interesting people and you can tell they\u2019ve never met anyone else who compares to the other, that\u2019s why they intrigue each other so much.\u00a0</p><p>I loved seeing them lie on the bed together and just be sort of free for a moment of all of life\u2019s burdens and anguish. Just free to be themselves, unrestrained and show their true selves to each other, naked.</p><p>For a moment I thought they would end up making out and in bed together because they did seem like they also may be slightly attracted to each other as well, at least emotionally if nothing else, but that\u2019s not what happened at all. It did actually surprise me.\u00a0</p><p>But instead Eve stabbed Villanelle while they were lying on the bed together, after they\u2019d gotten closer after she\u2019d played with Eve\u2019s hair a little.\u00a0</p><p>I think Villanelle was truly shocked by her actions and thought they could be friends, it seemed like is was heading that way but it seemed Eve was setting her up, getting her close to do the dirty and stab her. I was shocked too, honestly. I thought maybe they\u2019d run away together and have some weird fairytale ending, in a weird way.

While Villanelle (BTW, can we talk about how her name is literally\u00a0\u201cvillan\u201d +\u00a0\u201celle\u201d - like \u201cvillain\u201d + \u201celle\u201d -\u00a0\u201cshe-villain\u201d&hellip;) is clearly disturbed, Eve\u2019s non-conformity is more subtle. \u201cEve\u201d is the Biblical mother of all humanity and the cause of its descent into sin because she gave into temptation. But, the Eve in the show is portrayed as relatively non-maternal. She technically endangers a minor (Dom), laughs about Frank\u2019s children growing up motherless and with a drunk father, and immediately after that scene, her husband points out that she\u2019s \u201cglowing\u201d.

If Villanelle is the serpent tempting Eve going forward, I\u2019m interested to see how that temptation plays out. There\u2019s clearly a sexual element, as Villanelle appears to be bisexual and Eve is a little <i>too</i>\u00a0interested in female assassins - when her husband asks if she\u2019s agreed to work for MI6 just to help stop a killer, she can\u2019t answer.</p><p>-Amber</p>",
