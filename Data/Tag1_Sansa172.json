                "content": "<p>While it does seem at a first glance that Sansa submitted to Daenerys&hellip;if you pay attention the details, it&rsquo;s quite obvious that Sansa is playing the long game&hellip;and that&rsquo;s she going to win it. I feel like a lot of people forgot about Sansa&rsquo;s manipulation skills, and her courteous yet also passive-aggressive nature. I don&rsquo;t blame them, Sansa hadn&rsquo;t need of any of these in the past few seasons as she has been surrounded by friends and family in a secure environment. However, she now knows that the game has changed, and a new factor is part of it now, so she adapted, and is going to use all of the things she has learned through out her journey in order to make it out on top at the end of all of this. There&rsquo;s absolutely no chance that Daenerys will permanently get the North. It&rsquo;s the Starks&hellip;but before we get the high for our protagonists (which we all know are the Starks) that will beat all highs, we have to get a low, and Daenerys getting Winterfell and the North to submit to her is that low. So you better prepare for next season, because we&rsquo;re about to see Sansa win like she never won before.&nbsp;</p>",

But it would be more natural if Jon was the one to escort Dany forward to be greeted as a guest by the lady of the keep. Instead it is Jorah and Jon has already &lsquo;switched&rsquo; sides to stand side by side to  Sansa. </p><p>But of course they could mislead us and not let us hear what Jon says, but I admit I doubt it, just because an introduction to Sansa would make more sense, if he would walk by Dany&rsquo;s side and I doubt he would feel the necessity to introduce Dany to Sansa. I think it is just heavy and deep breathing that shows Jon&rsquo;s nerves. </p><p>I think it is interesting that he obviously did not wait for Da\u20acnerys to catch up but wanted to great Sansa first and alone. It changes the dynamic of who stands by whose side.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
