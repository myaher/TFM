She had been even while she was with her family, running away from their kidnappers. She was brave even when she was forced to come back as one of them, and forced to do their bidding.\u00a0</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to earn it then, she was always brave, but it felt earned either way. At least for a little while.\u00a0</p><hr><p>The dog creatures ambushed them, and Caleb was passed out on the ground from his injuries. It was just Nott between him and the dog monsters whose species name she had never learned.\u00a0</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let them kill him, he was her only friend, the only one who liked her despite how she looked now. She wouldn\u2019t let him die!\u00a0</p><p>There was more of them then her, but she fought them all off anyway, and did her fucking damnedest to kill every last fucking one of them.\u00a0</p><p>Once they were dead, she ran to Caleb and fed him her only healing potion, watching the cuts and bigger fissures close as he blinked blearily awake. She dragged him back to the inn, and brought him to their room.\u00a0</p><p>She stayed on the bed with him, watching over him while he slept it off.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Everything was on fucking fire where she stood in the house, but the dog things were back, and she wouldn\u2019t let them get away with attacking the town and stealing people away! Not when it meant less of a reward and more people missing their families!</p><p>She jumped from the second store, uncaring about the crack she heard from her ankle, and ran after the retreating dogs.\u00a0</p><p>She didn\u2019t anticipate the leader of them turning back around to look at her, or for him to train his bow on her, but she didn\u2019t back down. The arrow to her heart would at least have been worth it, if she died protecting a town and it\u2019s people like she wasn\u2019t able to with Felderwin.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Nott loved Jester, she was her best friend, and greatest partner in crime. And they were both alone with this massive fuck off dragon, along with Twiggy but she seemed safe enough, and also looking like some random weird dude.\u00a0</p><p>The dragon hit hard, but she knew Jester had to get away, and couldn\u2019t without help. It would kill Jester and eat her and no one would be able to save her. It was only smart that Nott get it\u2019s attention instead.\u00a0</p><p>So she ran to the button, not trying to make any move to avoid the bite the dragon gave her, and kept moving. She was bleeding a whole lot, and everything was kind of wobbly in places, but she was fine. It distracted him enough for Jester to escape, so she was <i>fine</i>!</p><p>She debated shooting it with her crossbow a second time, but her strength was getting dog shit and the first one hadn\u2019t gone well, so she dropped her hand on the button and fell onto the deck of the ship, watching the blood stain the wood with some fascination until both Twiggy and Jester appeared a few minutes later, after someone had scooped her up.\u00a0</p><p>The hug Jester gave her was nice, more so when it came with healing.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Nott stood outside the jail room, nervous and terrified and awfully sober. She listened to Jester talk to her husband as the friends around her made expressions at the conversation, looking immediately as adoring towards him with just one conversation as she was of her love.\u00a0</p><p>Quickly, she changed into her old self, and walked in. She felt like this was probably the most brave thing she could ever do in her love, considering everything that had happened.\u00a0</p><p>She loved him so much, she hoped he still would her, but would understand given the goblin thing.\u00a0</p><p>She nearly cried when instead of be disgusted, he hugged her and told her he loved her just as much as she did.\u00a0</p><p>It was probably the hardest thing she had ever done, and things still weren\u2019t perfect, but she was glad at least to have him again. Now the hard part was getting him back to Luc and keeping them safe from the war. Probably not as difficult as this meeting would be.\u00a0</p>",

        "body": "<p>\n\nHappy Birthday to Laura and Liam! This fic is based off a conversation I had with @banymasimo on twitter. I&rsquo;ve always imagined that Jester and Caleb just so happen to have the same birthday. &lt;3 <br/>[Read on ao3: <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19004923\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/19004923</a>]</p><p>It was one week until Jester&rsquo;s birthday. The Mighty Nein were in quiet chaos, preparing and trying to hide as much as possible from Jester&rsquo;s curious and perceptive eyes. While they were having breakfast, Jester excitedly petting Nugget and telling him how exciting it was going to be, Caleb eyebrows raised suddenly as he stopped eating and quietly said, &ldquo;Oh. Hm. I forgot about that&rdquo; The entire table went absolutely silent, all eyes on Caleb.</p><p>Nott piped up. &ldquo;What did you forget Caleb?&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat. &ldquo;Well, I forgot that my birthday is next week too. The same day as Jester&rsquo;s, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>Jester screamed. &ldquo;CALEB!!! WE&rsquo;RE BIRTHDAY TWINS??? Oh I&rsquo;m even more excited now!!&rdquo; Nott threw her hands up in their air and began barking out new plans. Beau groaned loudly and hit her head against the table. Caduceus smiled and said a &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nice&rdquo; which no one heard. Nugget started barking. Caleb&rsquo;s face was grew progressively more and more red. Yeza looked around completely bewildered by the sudden chaos. Fjord and Yasha had similar stunned expressions, both asking how he forgot his birthday, to which Caleb replied &ldquo;um, ja it&rsquo;s been a long time since I have celebrated my birthday. Most years I usually forget, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>And thus it was resolved that they were both going to have the best birthday ever.</p><!-- more --><p>Which leads us to today, the day of their birthday.</p><p>Jester is dancing around and bouncing off the walls. Caleb is desperately trying to be as quiet as possible and coop himself up in his room. Presents are hid in Nott and Yeza&rsquo;s room, with a stone shape spell hiding them, with Caduceus regularly keeping it up. It was agreed that Jester and Caleb needed to be out of the house - cake baking, decorating, and present wrapping all needed to happen. Beau was assigned to Caleb, and Fjord was assigned to Jester (and Nugget). Nott, Yeza, Yasha, and Caduceus stayed in the Xhorhouse. They had 3 hours.</p><p>Beau had it easy. Caleb didn&rsquo;t mind not being in the house. She took Caleb first to see Professor Wacoh, in hope that maybe, just <i>maybe</i> she might be able to get him into the library. She didn&rsquo;t, but at least the professor said happy birthday. Soon after they found Essek and he spent the rest of the 3 hours teaching a new spell to Caleb, who was most excited.</p><p>Fjord, however, had a bit more adventurous time. Jester could not be more excited and curious, and desperately wanted to see what kind of cake they were making, what decorations there could be, and what presents and surprises they were hiding. Whenever they walked, Jester slowly tried to lead them back to the house to get a look, and eventually Fjord just grabbed her hand and lead her to the other side of the city. They found a little cafe that sold pastries (both made a mental note of that place for future needs), a big space where Nugget ran around, and got a birthday present for Caleb. Jester&rsquo;s favourite part, however, is when they cast disguise self and played little pranks on whoever they could find. The 3 hours ended up flying by.</p><p>Back at the Xhorhouse, Yeza and Yasha were awkwardly and quietly putting up decorations that Beau had bought last week, with Yasha putting them up on the ceiling and Yeza taking care of things much lower down to the ground. Interestingly, Nott was having the most difficult time. Jester bought a dessert recipe book for Caduceus ages ago, but Nott has just discovered that he doesn&rsquo;t really know how to read.<br/>&ldquo;Is it ok if I just read you the instructions, then?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s nice of you, Nott.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;So we need two cups of sugar, and a 2/3 a cup of butter and they need to be melted together&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I have a cup, is this one nice?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Wait, Caduceus no, that&rsquo;s a tea cup. Like a measuring cup.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a measuring cup?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Wait, how have you been cooking this whole time??&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Oh I just know. Sometimes I&rsquo;m a little unsure but it always turns out just fine.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Oh my gods. Maybe let&rsquo;s get the dry ingredients ready first. Do we have half teaspoon of baking powder?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Half a teaspoon?? You want me to break my spoon in half??&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Yeza?? Can you help me in here please??&rdquo;</p><p>After the 3 hours had past, Jester burst through the door, with Fjord, Beau, and Caleb in tow. The cake was ready and waiting, with a chocolate one with many, many sprinkles for Jester, and a small strudel for Caleb. Presents and booze were opened, even Essek made an appearance, and Jester cast message back and forth with her mom, also alerting her the address of their Xhorhouse. Jester was overly thrilled with her new paints, sketchbook, and collar for Nugget. Caleb was covertly excited with his new paper, ink, and journal. All in all, good day.</p><p>As they sat around the table at the end of the day, Jester piped up with a soft smile on her face. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve never had a birthday party with friends before. I&rsquo;ve always wanted one&hellip; I think this is my favourite birthday ever.&rdquo; She looked up at her family, with the biggest smile on her face, who were all smiling back at her. &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb chimed in. &ldquo;Ja, thank you. This was nice. New, but nice.&rdquo;</p><p>Before anyone could say anything, there was a sudden <i>&ldquo;CAW&rdquo;</i> on the windowsill. Perched there, a raven, with a blue feather and a black feather in it&rsquo;s beak. Just as soon as it was there, it flew off just as suddenly. Caduceus walked over slowly, and gently picked up the feathers.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Caduceus spoke, with his typical relaxed deep voice, &ldquo;It looks like the universe left you a birthday present too.&rdquo;</p>",

Caleb is desperately trying to be as quiet as possible and coop himself up in his room. Presents are hid in Nott and Yeza\u2019s room, with a stone shape spell hiding them, with Caduceus regularly keeping it up. It was agreed that Jester and Caleb needed to be out of the house - cake baking, decorating, and present wrapping all needed to happen. Beau was assigned to Caleb, and Fjord was assigned to Jester (and Nugget). Nott, Yeza, Yasha, and Caduceus stayed in the Xhorhouse. They had 3 hours.</p><p>Beau had it easy. Caleb didn\u2019t mind not being in the house. She took Caleb first to see Professor Wacoh, in hope that maybe, just <i>maybe</i> she might be able to get him into the library. She didn\u2019t, but at least the professor said happy birthday. Soon after they found Essek and he spent the rest of the 3 hours teaching a new spell to Caleb, who was most excited.</p><p>Fjord, however, had a bit more adventurous time. Jester could not be more excited and curious, and desperately wanted to see what kind of cake they were making, what decorations there could be, and what presents and surprises they were hiding. Whenever they walked, Jester slowly tried to lead them back to the house to get a look, and eventually Fjord just grabbed her hand and lead her to the other side of the city. They found a little cafe that sold pastries (both made a mental note of that place for future needs), a big space where Nugget ran around, and got a birthday present for Caleb. Jester\u2019s favourite part, however, is when they cast disguise self and played little pranks on whoever they could find. The 3 hours ended up flying by.</p><p>Back at the Xhorhouse, Yeza and Yasha were awkwardly and quietly putting up decorations that Beau had bought last week, with Yasha putting them up on the ceiling and Yeza taking care of things much lower down to the ground. Interestingly, Nott was having the most difficult time. Jester bought a dessert recipe book for Caduceus ages ago, but Nott has just discovered that he doesn\u2019t really know how to read.<br>\u201cIs it ok if I just read you the instructions, then?\u201d<br>\u201cSure, that\u2019s nice of you, Nott.\u201d<br>\u201cSo we need two cups of sugar, and a 2/3 a cup of butter and they need to be melted together\u201d<br>\u201cI have a cup, is this one nice?\u201d<br>\u201cWait, Caduceus no, that\u2019s a tea cup. Like a measuring cup.\u201d<br>\u201cWhat\u2019s a measuring cup?\u201d<br>\u201cWait, how have you been cooking this whole time??\u201d<br>\u201cOh I just know. Sometimes I\u2019m a little unsure but it always turns out just fine.\u201d<br>\u201cOh my gods. Maybe let\u2019s get the dry ingredients ready first. Do we have half teaspoon of baking powder?\u201d<br>\u201cHalf a teaspoon?? You want me to break my spoon in half??\u201d<br>\u201cYeza?? Can you help me in here please??\u201d</p><p>After the 3 hours had past, Jester burst through the door, with Fjord, Beau, and Caleb in tow. The cake was ready and waiting, with a chocolate one with many, many sprinkles for Jester, and a small strudel for Caleb. Presents and booze were opened, even Essek made an appearance, and Jester cast message back and forth with her mom, also alerting her the address of their Xhorhouse. Jester was overly thrilled with her new paints, sketchbook, and collar for Nugget. Caleb was covertly excited with his new paper, ink, and journal. All in all, good day.</p><p>As they sat around the table at the end of the day, Jester piped up with a soft smile on her face. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never had a birthday party with friends before. I\u2019ve always wanted one\u2026 I think this is my favourite birthday ever.\u201d She looked up at her family, with the biggest smile on her face, who were all smiling back at her. \u201cThank you\u201d</p><p>Caleb chimed in. \u201cJa, thank you. This was nice. New, but nice.\u201d</p><p>Before anyone could say anything, there was a sudden <i>\u201cCAW\u201d</i> on the windowsill. Perched there, a raven, with a blue feather and a black feather in it\u2019s beak. Just as soon as it was there, it flew off just as suddenly. Caduceus walked over slowly, and gently picked up the feathers.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Caduceus spoke, with his typical relaxed deep voice, \u201cIt looks like the universe left you a birthday present too.\u201d</p>",
