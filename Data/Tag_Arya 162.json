Mulan angsts over this and questions whether this is who she is, just like Arya does question whether she was ever a lady. </p><p>Mulan proves right away to have tons of qualities like Arya; she has a dog companion that she makes help her with her chores (&ldquo;Nymeria, gloves!&rdquo; vibes?), she is kind to little girls and defends them agains other boys (Weasel anyone?), she shows intelligence to beat a man in Xi\u00e0ngp\u00ed with one move(Arya is smart as hell), Mulan SERVES in the imperial army much like Arya SERVES all through her story arc.. Mulan works HARD in the army to get good at being a soldier which screams Arya (not just Syrio, but everything in the House of Black and White is training). I also love the fact thay she took out Shan Yu&rsquo;s men not with force but with STREET SMARTS much like Arya survives throughout her storyline by pure wit and street smarts tbh. </p><p>Also break my heart with Mulan wishing to protect and honor her father, reminding me of little baby Arya asking Jory how many guards her father has and trying to run and save him from being beheaded. Even cooler is the fact that Mulan prays to her ancestors and then is protected by Mushu, which is a whole lot of things I could talk about Arya and the Old Gods.</p><p>Anyway, what I love most about this parallel is the idea not only that Mulan is key to defeating the Hun leader, but that she does it leading a group of soldiers faithful to her (go wolfpack!!), that she earns the respect of Manly Man Shang and the Emperor, restores her family&rsquo;s honor AND she does this dressed neither as Perfect Ladylike Matchmaking Material or as Common Man Wearing Armor but in the clothes she wore every day to be comfortable.</p>",
