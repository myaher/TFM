Enjoy. (WARNING: NOT PROOF READ!!!)</i><br/></p><p>Whoever said going to a wedding was the most fun you\u2019ll ever had, was a liar. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d You cringed at the yell of your name. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201d you quietly said in return, trying to calm the bride who was currently having her third meltdown of the night. </p><p>The first was right before the lovely bride walked down the aisle. </p><p>\u201cZoey, you look amazing what are you crying about?\u201d you asked wrapping your arms around her to comfort her. Her poofy hair engulfed your face as you held her. She didn\u2019t say anything, she just let go and held up her bouquet of flowers before she let out another long sob. You raised your eyebrows to question her.</p><p>\u201cEleven.\u201d was all she said still leaving you puzzled. You raised an eyebrow at her. </p><p>\u201cThere is supposed to be twelve flowers and there\u2019s only eleven.\u201d You scowled when you heard the other bridesmaids snicker. Sure, she was being a little dramatic for just one flower, sure no one would notice, but hell this was her day and you both spent so long making it perfect. </p><p>\u201cOkay how far away is a flower shop?\u201d you asked letting out a sigh. You saw her face light up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one across the street\u201d she said before someone cut in.</p><p>\u201cThere is not enough time to go and grab one flower.\u201d </p><p>\u201cZip it Carly and get the makeup girl over here,\u201d was all you said before you ran to your car. </p><p>You arrived back just in time and not a moment too late. Carly rolled her eyes but you would do anything for your best friend. It was worth the odd stares in the flower shop due to your overdone dress just to see her glowing as she walked down the aisle. You couldn\u2019t help but let out a few tears as the vows were said. But all good things must come to an end. </p><p>The second meltdown was during the pictures. </p><p>\u201cY/N, my dress.\u201d she said through gasps of air. Your eyes went wide at all the possibilities that could be wrong with her dress. </p><p>\u201cZoey what is wrong with your dress?\u201d you asked not wanting to hear the answer. You both spent months hunting for the \u2018perfect dress\u2019. Eventually she gave up and decided that nothing would ever live up to everything she wanted..until she had in her words, \u2018the most perfect idea.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cY/N you could totally make my dress!\u201d she said excitedly. You laughed thinking she was kidding only to realize she was standing there with a straight face. You sighed and buried your face in your hands. </p><p>\u201cOkay&hellip;fine, but you owe me big time when it\u2019s my turn\u201d you said and jokingly pointed at her to show her you were \u2018serious\u2019.</p><p>\u201cMy dress isn\u2019t poofing out enough like it used too.\u201d she said lifting her head to the sky so the tears wouldn\u2019t run down and ruin her mascara. You could hear the agony in her voice. </p><p>\u201cY/N should hide under your dress and hold it out to poof it up,\u201d you heard Carly say. You glared at her as she laughed in return only to turn around and see Zoey\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cNo no no,\u201d was all you replied. </p><p>Next thing you knew you were under your best friend&rsquo;s skirt staring at nothing but white tulle. </p><p>\u2018My wedding dress will be bright blue.\u2019 you thought to yourself after staring at the white fabric for a solid twenty minutes. You weren\u2019t too mad in the end, when it was your turn to take pictures with the bride, Carly was hidden under the mass of fabric. You\u2019ve never looked so happy in a photo. </p><p>The rest of the majority of the night was spent laughing and dancing away with your friends. The speeches were your favorite part of the night. </p><p>You heard the clinking of glass being hit as a tall man stood up. You had seen him a few times during the rehearsals and such, but he was always busy with work, travelling a lot. </p><p>\u201cHi, uh my name is Steve Rogers, I usually don\u2019t do too much public speaking so this is a little odd.\u201d he said earning a quiet laugh from the crowd attempting to make him feel better. </p><p>\u201cWhen I met Mason,\u201d he said giving the groom a pat on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI would have never thought I would be his best man at his wedding.We barely talked when we met and hung out at a mutual friend\u2019s place, you guys may not believe this but I\u2019m actually pretty shy. We finally bonded over not understanding things like the internet or 90\u2019s rom-com movies.\u201d he said this time earning a genuine laugh from the guests. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take too much time up, I know the maid of honor will need to talk. So i just want to say, I love you like a brother man, and I\u2019m so happy for you and Zoey, best of luck in this marriage.\u201d He finished and began to walk over to pass the mic to you. You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off of him as he approached. You were amazed how he could have such a dominating demeanor, but have such kind and sincere eyes. </p><p>\u2018Note to self, get to know that man\u2019 you thought before you stood up. </p><p>\u201cHi guys,\u201d you said to the crowd before looking at Zoey. </p><p>\u201cZoey, first I want to start off by saying I love you. I could not have asked for a better best friend. From the moment we met, I knew we were going to be friends for a very very long time. Okay, well not when we first met because we were like I don\u2019t know, one years old? Anyways it doesn\u2019t matter, from the moment I could understand the concept of friendship, I knew we were going to be friends forever.\u201d you heard the crowd giggle a little as you looked at Steve who had a hand covering his mouth trying not to laugh. </p><p>\u201cAlright I know you guys don\u2019t really want to hear me babble on for too much longer, so I will just say Z, I love you, no offense Mason, but I think I love her more.\u201d You said only semi-joking, he put his hands up in surrender. He already knew he couldn\u2019t replace you.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m glad you two finally got together at that coffee shop because now look, you guys are married!! Okay, okay, I think I said enough.\u201d you ended your speech and sat back down as the guests clapped for Steve and yourself. </p><p>The night droned on as people began to get too drunk to physically dance. Most people ended up sitting in random places of the reception hall. You figured you should go and mingle a little, although it might not be that fun considering the lack of booze in your system. You wanted to be ready for whatever this wedding threw at you so drinking was out of the picture unless uncontrollable laughing was a way to solve a problem. </p><p>\u201cHey stranger,\u201d you said sitting next to the best man. </p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you sitting all alone?\u201d you asked Steve. </p><p>\u201cMost people are too drunk to speak, so I figured I wouldn\u2019t try and talk. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d you replied and sighed. </p><p>\u201cPlus, I\u2019ve been running around trying to make sure everything is perfect for Zoey.\u201d you said and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw you under her dress earlier.\u201d he said and chuckled. You could feel your face begin to heat up and turn red. </p><p>\u201cHey you have it easy, I bet Mason doesn\u2019t have meltdowns.\u201d You said in your defense. </p><p>\u201cNo, no he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Steve smiled at you. You felt the butterflies in your stomach begin to take flight. </p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you known the groom,\u201d you asked trying to get to know him better. </p><p>\u201cAbout six years, give or take.\u201d You were shocked by the reponse.</p><p>\u201cGeez, how come I haven\u2019t met you sooner? I\u2019ve known Mason almost as long, four years I think.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI work. A lot. Plus, I travel a lot.\u201d You nodded to show you were listening to him when \u2018Rude\u2019 by Magic! began to play. </p><p>\u201cI used to love this song,\u201d you both said in unison. A blush crept on your cheeks. </p><p>\u201cSo, Ms. Y/L/N, how would you like to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!!\u201d </p><p>\u2018No please, not now\u2019 you thought to yourself. Sure enough, a drunk, crying bride came your way dragging her equally as drunk bridesmaid with her. </p><p>\u201cCarly, you had one job! Don\u2019t allow her to get too wasted!\u201d you yelled.</p><p>\u201cYou see, I tried\u201d she said and hiccuped</p><p>\u201cBut the bartender was cute and I needed an excuse to talk to him\u201d She turned around giving finger guns towards the bartender while shooting him a wink. You rolled your eyes as the man just turned the other way.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Zoey why are you yelling my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need help.\u201d You gave her a face saying \u2018tell me more\u2019&hellip;she didn\u2019t get the hint to keep talking.</p><p>\u201cNeed help with what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA lot of things. Follow me,\u201d she giddily said before you turned to Steve with an apologetic expression. He gave you a small smile before you walked away. </p><p>Finally, after helping her pee, cleaning up all of her flowers, and finding her veil, you went back to find the best man. Unfortunately, by the time you were done helping your best friend, everyone else besides Carly and the bartender had left. </p><p>You sighed and decided it wasn\u2019t meant to be anyways before taking off your heels and walking to your car. </p><p>Three days later you were finally back to work. As you walked into the coffee shop the familiar scent hit your nose and made you grin. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have two iced coffees and one chai latte,\u201d you read off your phone. </p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d was all the lady at the counter said before motioning you to pay. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d You grabbed the drink carrier full of beverages. Your phone began to vibrate in your pocket. </p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d<br/>\u201cCrap that\u2019s hot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d you said attempting to grab a few napkins before seeing the person in front of you. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d You sighed seeing Steve in front of you before attempting to help clean the coffee from his shirt. </p><p>\u2018Damn this feels nice\u2019 you said as you pat his chest. </p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d he sarcastically said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about walking away the other night, Zoey really needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo um,\u201d you suddenly found it awkward to speak. </p><p>\u201cI guess I should go reorder the drinks and call my boss back-\u201d<br/>\u201cWould you like to go get dinner with me this Friday,\u201d he interrupted. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I would like that a lot.\u201d You smiled at him and then snapped back into reality. </p><p>\u201cAlthough I really should call my boss back, he gets mad pretty easily.\u201d<br/>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said and then rolled his eyes. You quickly wrote your number on a napkin and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday.\u201d You turned around and got back in line. </p><p>\u201cYeah, see ya.\u201d he repeated to himself and walked out the door, a big dopey grin on both of your faces.</p>",

Enjoy. (WARNING: NOT PROOF READ!!!)</i><br></p><p>Whoever said going to a wedding was the most fun you\u2019ll ever had, was a liar. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d You cringed at the yell of your name. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201d you quietly said in return, trying to calm the bride who was currently having her third meltdown of the night. </p><p>The first was right before the lovely bride walked down the aisle. </p><p>\u201cZoey, you look amazing what are you crying about?\u201d you asked wrapping your arms around her to comfort her. Her poofy hair engulfed your face as you held her. She didn\u2019t say anything, she just let go and held up her bouquet of flowers before she let out another long sob. You raised your eyebrows to question her.</p><p>\u201cEleven.\u201d was all she said still leaving you puzzled. You raised an eyebrow at her. </p><p>\u201cThere is supposed to be twelve flowers and there\u2019s only eleven.\u201d You scowled when you heard the other bridesmaids snicker. Sure, she was being a little dramatic for just one flower, sure no one would notice, but hell this was her day and you both spent so long making it perfect. </p><p>\u201cOkay how far away is a flower shop?\u201d you asked letting out a sigh. You saw her face light up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one across the street\u201d she said before someone cut in.</p><p>\u201cThere is not enough time to go and grab one flower.\u201d </p><p>\u201cZip it Carly and get the makeup girl over here,\u201d was all you said before you ran to your car. </p><p>You arrived back just in time and not a moment too late. Carly rolled her eyes but you would do anything for your best friend. It was worth the odd stares in the flower shop due to your overdone dress just to see her glowing as she walked down the aisle. You couldn\u2019t help but let out a few tears as the vows were said. But all good things must come to an end. </p><p>The second meltdown was during the pictures. </p><p>\u201cY/N, my dress.\u201d she said through gasps of air. Your eyes went wide at all the possibilities that could be wrong with her dress. </p><p>\u201cZoey what is wrong with your dress?\u201d you asked not wanting to hear the answer. You both spent months hunting for the \u2018perfect dress\u2019. Eventually she gave up and decided that nothing would ever live up to everything she wanted..until she had in her words, \u2018the most perfect idea.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cY/N you could totally make my dress!\u201d she said excitedly. You laughed thinking she was kidding only to realize she was standing there with a straight face. You sighed and buried your face in your hands. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026fine, but you owe me big time when it\u2019s my turn\u201d you said and jokingly pointed at her to show her you were \u2018serious\u2019.</p><p>\u201cMy dress isn\u2019t poofing out enough like it used too.\u201d she said lifting her head to the sky so the tears wouldn\u2019t run down and ruin her mascara. You could hear the agony in her voice. </p><p>\u201cY/N should hide under your dress and hold it out to poof it up,\u201d you heard Carly say. You glared at her as she laughed in return only to turn around and see Zoey\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cNo no no,\u201d was all you replied. </p><p>Next thing you knew you were under your best friend\u2019s skirt staring at nothing but white tulle. </p><p>\u2018My wedding dress will be bright blue.\u2019 you thought to yourself after staring at the white fabric for a solid twenty minutes. You weren\u2019t too mad in the end, when it was your turn to take pictures with the bride, Carly was hidden under the mass of fabric. You\u2019ve never looked so happy in a photo. </p><p>The rest of the majority of the night was spent laughing and dancing away with your friends. The speeches were your favorite part of the night. </p><p>You heard the clinking of glass being hit as a tall man stood up. You had seen him a few times during the rehearsals and such, but he was always busy with work, travelling a lot. </p><p>\u201cHi, uh my name is Steve Rogers, I usually don\u2019t do too much public speaking so this is a little odd.\u201d he said earning a quiet laugh from the crowd attempting to make him feel better. </p><p>\u201cWhen I met Mason,\u201d he said giving the groom a pat on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI would have never thought I would be his best man at his wedding.We barely talked when we met and hung out at a mutual friend\u2019s place, you guys may not believe this but I\u2019m actually pretty shy. We finally bonded over not understanding things like the internet or 90\u2019s rom-com movies.\u201d he said this time earning a genuine laugh from the guests. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take too much time up, I know the maid of honor will need to talk.

You saw her face light up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one across the street\u201d she said before someone cut in.</p><p>\u201cThere is not enough time to go and grab one flower.\u201d </p><p>\u201cZip it Carly and get the makeup girl over here,\u201d was all you said before you ran to your car. </p><p>You arrived back just in time and not a moment too late. Carly rolled her eyes but you would do anything for your best friend. It was worth the odd stares in the flower shop due to your overdone dress just to see her glowing as she walked down the aisle. You couldn\u2019t help but let out a few tears as the vows were said. But all good things must come to an end. </p><p>The second meltdown was during the pictures. </p><p>\u201cY/N, my dress.\u201d she said through gasps of air. Your eyes went wide at all the possibilities that could be wrong with her dress. </p><p>\u201cZoey what is wrong with your dress?\u201d you asked not wanting to hear the answer. You both spent months hunting for the \u2018perfect dress\u2019. Eventually she gave up and decided that nothing would ever live up to everything she wanted..until she had in her words, \u2018the most perfect idea.\u2019 </p><p>\u201cY/N you could totally make my dress!\u201d she said excitedly. You laughed thinking she was kidding only to realize she was standing there with a straight face. You sighed and buried your face in your hands. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026fine, but you owe me big time when it\u2019s my turn\u201d you said and jokingly pointed at her to show her you were \u2018serious\u2019.</p><p>\u201cMy dress isn\u2019t poofing out enough like it used too.\u201d she said lifting her head to the sky so the tears wouldn\u2019t run down and ruin her mascara. You could hear the agony in her voice. </p><p>\u201cY/N should hide under your dress and hold it out to poof it up,\u201d you heard Carly say. You glared at her as she laughed in return only to turn around and see Zoey\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cNo no no,\u201d was all you replied. </p><p>Next thing you knew you were under your best friend\u2019s skirt staring at nothing but white tulle. </p><p>\u2018My wedding dress will be bright blue.\u2019 you thought to yourself after staring at the white fabric for a solid twenty minutes. You weren\u2019t too mad in the end, when it was your turn to take pictures with the bride, Carly was hidden under the mass of fabric. You\u2019ve never looked so happy in a photo. </p><p>The rest of the majority of the night was spent laughing and dancing away with your friends. The speeches were your favorite part of the night. </p><p>You heard the clinking of glass being hit as a tall man stood up. You had seen him a few times during the rehearsals and such, but he was always busy with work, travelling a lot. </p><p>\u201cHi, uh my name is Steve Rogers, I usually don\u2019t do too much public speaking so this is a little odd.\u201d he said earning a quiet laugh from the crowd attempting to make him feel better. </p><p>\u201cWhen I met Mason,\u201d he said giving the groom a pat on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI would have never thought I would be his best man at his wedding.We barely talked when we met and hung out at a mutual friend\u2019s place, you guys may not believe this but I\u2019m actually pretty shy. We finally bonded over not understanding things like the internet or 90\u2019s rom-com movies.\u201d he said this time earning a genuine laugh from the guests. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take too much time up, I know the maid of honor will need to talk. So i just want to say, I love you like a brother man, and I\u2019m so happy for you and Zoey, best of luck in this marriage.\u201d He finished and began to walk over to pass the mic to you. You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off of him as he approached. You were amazed how he could have such a dominating demeanor, but have such kind and sincere eyes. </p><p>\u2018Note to self, get to know that man\u2019 you thought before you stood up. </p><p>\u201cHi guys,\u201d you said to the crowd before looking at Zoey. </p><p>\u201cZoey, first I want to start off by saying I love you. I could not have asked for a better best friend. From the moment we met, I knew we were going to be friends for a very very long time. Okay, well not when we first met because we were like I don\u2019t know, one years old? Anyways it doesn\u2019t matter, from the moment I could understand the concept of friendship, I knew we were going to be friends forever.\u201d you heard the crowd giggle a little as you looked at Steve who had a hand covering his mouth trying not to laugh. </p><p>\u201cAlright I know you guys don\u2019t really want to hear me babble on for too much longer, so I will just say Z, I love you, no offense Mason, but I think I love her more.\u201d You said only semi-joking, he put his hands up in surrender. He already knew he couldn\u2019t replace you.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m glad you two finally got together at that coffee shop because now look, you guys are married!! Okay, okay, I think I said enough.\u201d you ended your speech and sat back down as the guests clapped for Steve and yourself. </p><p>The night droned on as people began to get too drunk to physically dance. Most people ended up sitting in random places of the reception hall. You figured you should go and mingle a little, although it might not be that fun considering the lack of booze in your system. You wanted to be ready for whatever this wedding threw at you so drinking was out of the picture unless uncontrollable laughing was a way to solve a problem. </p><p>\u201cHey stranger,\u201d you said sitting next to the best man. </p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you sitting all alone?\u201d you asked Steve. </p><p>\u201cMost people are too drunk to speak, so I figured I wouldn\u2019t try and talk. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d you replied and sighed. </p><p>\u201cPlus, I\u2019ve been running around trying to make sure everything is perfect for Zoey.\u201d you said and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw you under her dress earlier.\u201d he said and chuckled. You could feel your face begin to heat up and turn red. </p><p>\u201cHey you have it easy, I bet Mason doesn\u2019t have meltdowns.\u201d You said in your defense. </p><p>\u201cNo, no he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Steve smiled at you. You felt the butterflies in your stomach begin to take flight. </p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you known the groom,\u201d you asked trying to get to know him better. </p><p>\u201cAbout six years, give or take.\u201d You were shocked by the reponse.</p><p>\u201cGeez, how come I haven\u2019t met you sooner? I\u2019ve known Mason almost as long, four years I think.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI work. A lot. Plus, I travel a lot.\u201d You nodded to show you were listening to him when \u2018Rude\u2019 by Magic! began to play. </p><p>\u201cI used to love this song,\u201d you both said in unison. A blush crept on your cheeks. </p><p>\u201cSo, Ms. Y/L/N, how would you like to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N!!\u201d </p><p>\u2018No please, not now\u2019 you thought to yourself. Sure enough, a drunk, crying bride came your way dragging her equally as drunk bridesmaid with her. </p><p>\u201cCarly, you had one job! Don\u2019t allow her to get too wasted!\u201d you yelled.</p><p>\u201cYou see, I tried\u201d she said and hiccuped</p><p>\u201cBut the bartender was cute and I needed an excuse to talk to him\u201d She turned around giving finger guns towards the bartender while shooting him a wink. You rolled your eyes as the man just turned the other way.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Zoey why are you yelling my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need help.\u201d You gave her a face saying \u2018tell me more\u2019\u2026she didn\u2019t get the hint to keep talking.</p><p>\u201cNeed help with what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cA lot of things. Follow me,\u201d she giddily said before you turned to Steve with an apologetic expression. He gave you a small smile before you walked away. </p><p>Finally, after helping her pee, cleaning up all of her flowers, and finding her veil, you went back to find the best man. Unfortunately, by the time you were done helping your best friend, everyone else besides Carly and the bartender had left. </p><p>You sighed and decided it wasn\u2019t meant to be anyways before taking off your heels and walking to your car. </p><p>Three days later you were finally back to work. As you walked into the coffee shop the familiar scent hit your nose and made you grin. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have two iced coffees and one chai latte,\u201d you read off your phone. </p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d was all the lady at the counter said before motioning you to pay. </p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d You grabbed the drink carrier full of beverages. Your phone began to vibrate in your pocket. </p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d<br>\u201cCrap that\u2019s hot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d you said attempting to grab a few napkins before seeing the person in front of you. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d You sighed seeing Steve in front of you before attempting to help clean the coffee from his shirt. </p><p>\u2018Damn this feels nice\u2019 you said as you pat his chest. </p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d he sarcastically said. </p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about walking away the other night, Zoey really needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo um,\u201d you suddenly found it awkward to speak. </p><p>\u201cI guess I should go reorder the drinks and call my boss back-\u201d<br>\u201cWould you like to go get dinner with me this Friday,\u201d he interrupted. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I would like that a lot.\u201d You smiled at him and then snapped back into reality. </p><p>\u201cAlthough I really should call my boss back, he gets mad pretty easily.\u201d<br>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said and then rolled his eyes. You quickly wrote your number on a napkin and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Friday.\u201d You turned around and got back in line. </p><p>\u201cYeah, see ya.\u201d he repeated to himself and walked out the door, a big dopey grin on both of your faces.</p></p>",
