Meet Me In the Hallway</b></p><p>You called sick for the week not wanting to confront Harry after admitting to being in love with him. It was all too much. And not that it was a total lie either, you did feel sick. Of seeing Harry. When you finally showed your face on Monday it was found that official records of two of the songs where complete, you just had to approve and they would be 100% ready. You wrote them off then set yourself to every other task you had to do that didn\u2019t involve Harry. On the occasion you would hear him or see him coming you would go to another room. You knew you couldn\u2019t avoid him forever in this situation but it was a temporary fix. (Badum tshhh). The next level was keeping talking to a minimum with him, only addressing important work and any other messages you left with Mark (the second producer). It was about two weeks into this new routine that Harry had another sample. After arguing with Pip for hours it was demanded that you stay for the recording and producing. \u2018It\u2019s your job Ava, since when do you not want to be all hands on with his kind of stuff, you love it. I just don\u2019t understand.\u2019 Pip shakes her head at you. </p><p>I flop onto her sofa and huff. \u2018I do love it, but just not with him.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What is it about him? There\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me. I can tell, have you had a past relationship with him? Because he sure seemed to remember you that first day.\u2019 She crosses her arms across her chest. You couldn\u2019t not address the elephant in the room this time. You sigh in defeat. \u2018Look, we worked together a few years ago before he was famous. I guess we had some kind of you could say one sided relationship issues and I never thought I\u2019d have to see him again but here we are.\u2019 She cocks her head to the side in thought.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean one sided relationship issues?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God. Like, I\u2019m in love with someone who doesn\u2019t love me back and it hurt when they left me.\u2019 You say exasperated.</p><p>\u2018You love him?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t say that. I said I loved him. Past tense.\u2019 You correct.</p><p>She laughs putting her hands on her hips. \u2018No Ava, you said love. I think you still have some kind of relationship issues.\u2019</p><p>You scrunch your nose. \u2018We aren\u2019t in a relationship how can we have issues.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in a work relationship.\u2019 She states.</p><p>To your dismay you do end up being put into work with him again with recording. It\u2019s early Tuesday morning and you have a coffee in hand headset on and grumpy as hell. Not in the mood for Pip\u2019s breezy floating mood. You get her out of the studio just to have one less thing on your mind. You adjust knobs and buttons on the recording desk than signal to Harry to begin. </p><p>\u2018Cause you left me in the hallway.\u2019</p><p>Yeah that hit close to home. You feel sick but not because you\u2019re sick. You had left him in the hallway, and now it was another line in another one of his songs. He had sung the whole song locking eyes with you the whole time and you\u2019d never felt more vulnerable than that moment. This sucked. Harry wasn\u2019t as warm to you either these past few weeks, you were both upset and hurt. But you pushed on with your fa\u00e7ade and so did he. Suddenly the door flung open and in walked some new guy you\u2019d never seen at the office before. He must have been in his twenties too and he made your stomach do a flip. </p><p>He smiled. \u2018Hi I\u2019m Alfie, I\u2019m new and I am the recording engineer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 You squeak and you feel your face go red. \u2018Oh, I mean. Yes. Hi. I\u2019m Ava, Ava Bentley. I\u2019m the producer. I guess you\u2019re our recording engineer I haven\u2019t met you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018British?\u2019 He acknowledges your accent.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yes. Redditch.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s cute.\u2019 He smiles at you.</p><p>You blush, and tuck a lose strand of hair behind your ear. \u2018Thank you. Okay well I guess we should run over a couple other songs then. Harry?\u2019 You look at Harry, who looks like he\u2019s tasted something sour. \u2018Sure thing love.\u2019 He nods at Alfie. \u2018We\u2019ve met.\u2019 His says, his voice turning back to melted honey. You look back at Alfie and bite your lip. Maybe you could deal with Harry, now that you had a \u2018distraction.\u2019 You\u2019re surprised how easy it is to talk to Alfie, both with your extensive knowledge and passion for music. And you find yourself being more productive. The day went too quickly and you hadn\u2019t even thought of Harry, which was a first. \u2018Hey, you know we should like meet up some time for drinks or something, I\u2019d love to get to know you more seeing as we\u2019ll be working together.\u2019 Alfie says as you lock up the studio. You turn to face him and the wind whips your hair in your face. You brush it away and grin. \u2018Yeah that would be nice.\u2019 </p><p>The following week Alfie calls you and you instantly pick up. Different to if Harry had called. \u2018Hello, Ava speaking.\u2019 You twist your hair, feelings like a teenage girl. \u2018Hi, so there\u2019s this event tomorrow night, it\u2019s in town and it\u2019s like pretty cool, there\u2019s going to be artists and producers and lots of cool people into music and I got invited with a plus one, if you\u2019d like to join.\u2019 He speaks through the phone. You smile even though he can\u2019t see you. \u2018I\u2019d love to join you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Great well, I guess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night. I\u2019ll send you the details.\u2019</p><p>Picking out an outfit was the most fun you\u2019d had in a long time. You decided on a spaghetti strap black dress and heels to match. You liked the sultry dark look, it went well with your eyes. After weeks of hibernation, the red lip came back. You\u2019d decided that you did like it and that you were over Harry and his stupid song. You heard a light tap on your door and you flung it open and did jazz hands to show yourself off. \u2018Wow. Ava you look amazing.\u2019 Alfie says taken aback. \u2018Thank you. You should see yourself.\u2019 You giggle. He lifts his arm for you to take and you do, letting him take you to the Uber out the front. So many people that you had heard of but never met where at this event and the celebrities did your head in. You couldn\u2019t believe you where in a room with so many talented people, the possibilities were endless. Many of them performed. But the one person who you\u2019d spotted in the crowd that made your head spin was Harry. He was every where. Sure he noticed you and sure his eyes where on you a bit longer than necessary but who cares. You looked good and you knew it. Alfie came back over to you with another drink. Alfie bent down to talk in your ear so he could be heard over the music. \u2018How would you like to dance.\u2019 He said running his fingers down your arms causing a shiver to run down your spine. You wondered if Harry\u2019s hands would feel the same. But you pushed that thought to the back of your mind. You glanced to the side where you had seen Harry and saw him standing there in the corner, watching you. You realized that you didn\u2019t really like Alfie, he was after all a distraction, and you felt bad using him to get on Harry\u2019s nerves. But Alfie didn\u2019t have to know that. You turned to talk in Alfie\u2019s ear your lips brushing against his skin. \u2018I\u2019d love to dance.\u2019</p>",

Meet Me In the Hallway</b></p><p>You called sick for the week not wanting to confront Harry after admitting to being in love with him. It was all too much. And not that it was a total lie either, you did feel sick. Of seeing Harry. When you finally showed your face on Monday it was found that official records of two of the songs where complete, you just had to approve and they would be 100% ready. You wrote them off then set yourself to every other task you had to do that didn\u2019t involve Harry. On the occasion you would hear him or see him coming you would go to another room. You knew you couldn\u2019t avoid him forever in this situation but it was a temporary fix. (Badum tshhh). The next level was keeping talking to a minimum with him, only addressing important work and any other messages you left with Mark (the second producer). It was about two weeks into this new routine that Harry had another sample. After arguing with Pip for hours it was demanded that you stay for the recording and producing. \u2018It\u2019s your job Ava, since when do you not want to be all hands on with his kind of stuff, you love it. I just don\u2019t understand.\u2019 Pip shakes her head at you. </p><p>I flop onto her sofa and huff. \u2018I do love it, but just not with him.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018What is it about him? There\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me. I can tell, have you had a past relationship with him? Because he sure seemed to remember you that first day.\u2019 She crosses her arms across her chest. You couldn\u2019t not address the elephant in the room this time. You sigh in defeat. \u2018Look, we worked together a few years ago before he was famous. I guess we had some kind of you could say one sided relationship issues and I never thought I\u2019d have to see him again but here we are.\u2019 She cocks her head to the side in thought.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean one sided relationship issues?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God. Like, I\u2019m in love with someone who doesn\u2019t love me back and it hurt when they left me.\u2019 You say exasperated.</p><p>\u2018You love him?\u2019 </p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t say that. I said I loved him. Past tense.\u2019 You correct.</p><p>She laughs putting her hands on her hips. \u2018No Ava, you said love. I think you still have some kind of relationship issues.\u2019</p><p>You scrunch your nose. \u2018We aren\u2019t in a relationship how can we have issues.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in a work relationship.\u2019 She states.</p><p>To your dismay you do end up being put into work with him again with recording. It\u2019s early Tuesday morning and you have a coffee in hand headset on and grumpy as hell. Not in the mood for Pip\u2019s breezy floating mood. You get her out of the studio just to have one less thing on your mind. You adjust knobs and buttons on the recording desk than signal to Harry to begin. </p><p>\u2018Cause you left me in the hallway.\u2019</p><p>Yeah that hit close to home. You feel sick but not because you\u2019re sick. You had left him in the hallway, and now it was another line in another one of his songs. He had sung the whole song locking eyes with you the whole time and you\u2019d never felt more vulnerable than that moment. This sucked. Harry wasn\u2019t as warm to you either these past few weeks, you were both upset and hurt. But you pushed on with your fa\u00e7ade and so did he. Suddenly the door flung open and in walked some new guy you\u2019d never seen at the office before. He must have been in his twenties too and he made your stomach do a flip. </p><p>He smiled. \u2018Hi I\u2019m Alfie, I\u2019m new and I am the recording engineer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 You squeak and you feel your face go red. \u2018Oh, I mean. Yes. Hi. I\u2019m Ava, Ava Bentley. I\u2019m the producer. I guess you\u2019re our recording engineer I haven\u2019t met you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018British?\u2019 He acknowledges your accent.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yes. Redditch.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s cute.\u2019 He smiles at you.</p><p>You blush, and tuck a lose strand of hair behind your ear. \u2018Thank you. Okay well I guess we should run over a couple other songs then. Harry?\u2019 You look at Harry, who looks like he\u2019s tasted something sour. \u2018Sure thing love.\u2019 He nods at Alfie. \u2018We\u2019ve met.\u2019 His says, his voice turning back to melted honey. You look back at Alfie and bite your lip. Maybe you could deal with Harry, now that you had a \u2018distraction.\u2019 You\u2019re surprised how easy it is to talk to Alfie, both with your extensive knowledge and passion for music. And you find yourself being more productive. The day went too quickly and you hadn\u2019t even thought of Harry, which was a first. \u2018Hey, you know we should like meet up some time for drinks or something, I\u2019d love to get to know you more seeing as we\u2019ll be working together.\u2019 Alfie says as you lock up the studio. You turn to face him and the wind whips your hair in your face. You brush it away and grin. \u2018Yeah that would be nice.\u2019 </p><p>The following week Alfie calls you and you instantly pick up. Different to if Harry had called. \u2018Hello, Ava speaking.\u2019 You twist your hair, feelings like a teenage girl. \u2018Hi, so there\u2019s this event tomorrow night, it\u2019s in town and it\u2019s like pretty cool, there\u2019s going to be artists and producers and lots of cool people into music and I got invited with a plus one, if you\u2019d like to join.\u2019 He speaks through the phone. You smile even though he can\u2019t see you. \u2018I\u2019d love to join you.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018Great well, I guess I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night. I\u2019ll send you the details.\u2019</p><p>Picking out an outfit was the most fun you\u2019d had in a long time. You decided on a spaghetti strap black dress and heels to match. You liked the sultry dark look, it went well with your eyes. After weeks of hibernation, the red lip came back. You\u2019d decided that you did like it and that you were over Harry and his stupid song. You heard a light tap on your door and you flung it open and did jazz hands to show yourself off. \u2018Wow. Ava you look amazing.\u2019 Alfie says taken aback. \u2018Thank you. You should see yourself.\u2019 You giggle. He lifts his arm for you to take and you do, letting him take you to the Uber out the front. So many people that you had heard of but never met where at this event and the celebrities did your head in. You couldn\u2019t believe you where in a room with so many talented people, the possibilities were endless. Many of them performed. But the one person who you\u2019d spotted in the crowd that made your head spin was Harry. He was every where. Sure he noticed you and sure his eyes where on you a bit longer than necessary but who cares. You looked good and you knew it. Alfie came back over to you with another drink. Alfie bent down to talk in your ear so he could be heard over the music. \u2018How would you like to dance.\u2019 He said running his fingers down your arms causing a shiver to run down your spine. You wondered if Harry\u2019s hands would feel the same. But you pushed that thought to the back of your mind. You glanced to the side where you had seen Harry and saw him standing there in the corner, watching you. You realized that you didn\u2019t really like Alfie, he was after all a distraction, and you felt bad using him to get on Harry\u2019s nerves. But Alfie didn\u2019t have to know that. You turned to talk in Alfie\u2019s ear your lips brushing against his skin. \u2018I\u2019d love to dance.\u2019</p></p>",

From The Dining Table</b></p><p>The next few weeks you removed yourself from all the recording days choosing to only listen to them on your own and evaluate then discuss your opinion with Harry and Pip on meeting days. It was time for you to listen to another song, others had been written and put out into draft song form such as Carolina and Only Angel which you secretly digged (because they weren\u2019t about you). However I guess it was short lived because harry wasn\u2019t the best at subtly, lord he didn\u2019t even try it. You placed the headphone over your ears and the first few notes played, along came his warm voice. You closed your eyes. You hated how vulnerable his music made you feel, especially the one he wrote about you. This song was the exact same. But it also made you angry, you felt like harry was blaming you for everything when he was the one who stopped calling. It wasn\u2019t even like you were lovers or anything. Why was he writing so emotionally about you? I guess it\u2019s inspiring to think of it as lovers. You had loved him and that\u2019s probably why it hurt so much when he left. Goddamit, you sat in silence after listening to the song pondering the meaning over and over in your head. The sound of someone coughing startled you out of your thoughts. You pushed the headphones off you head and turned to find Harry leaning in the doorway. \u2018So what do you think?\u2019</p><p>He queried. You stared at him silently.</p><p>He frowned pushing away from the doorframe. \u2018I\u2019m not a monster, you can talk to me love.\u2019 He smiles that damn crooked smile.</p><p>\u2018Stop.\u2019 You say.</p><p>He stops. </p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 You shake your head. \u2018It\u2019s not fair.\u2019 You look at him and blink back tears.</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t blame it on me.\u2019 You stand up to face him, but being a measly 5\u20195 and him 5\u201911 he stood over you. </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you dare say I didn\u2019t call you because I did, Harry. Everyday. You\u2019re the one who never answered or retuned them.\u2019</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u2018Whatever or whoever you\u2019re writing from.\u2019 You jab his chest with your finger. \u2018You need something new to motivate you.\u2019 You turn away so he doesn\u2019t see the tear spill from you eye. You wipe it away with the back of your hand. </p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 Harry spoke up. You turn around to face him again your blood boiling.</p><p>\u2018How the fuck would you not know. It was your own phone!\u2019 You spit at him and he flinches, not accustomed to this new found anger.</p><p>\u2018I never got any voice mails. And when I tried calling you someone else answered, you changed your number?\u2019 He started to get angry too. You stumble back confused.</p><p>\u2018What? I never changed my number, not for another five years at least.\u2019 </p><p>His face flicks from confusion back to anger before settling with confusion.</p><p>\u2018Well I dont know what happened but I wasn\u2019t avoiding you.\u2019 He said calmly breathing in and out and unclenching his jaw. You just stare at him. Again you feel tears prick your eyes. No. Not again. </p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll see you on Wednesday.\u2019 You mutter before grabbing your bag and heading out the door. \u2018Wait.\u2019 He calls. You stop but don\u2019t turn. He walks around to you and hands you the usb with the demo. \u2018You might want this.\u2019 You look ahead as he places the usb in your hand. His fingers cold on your skin. Making goosebumps appear from the contact. He walks back down the hall leaving you. You don\u2019t listen to the song again just let it sit on your counter top staring at you. You get tempted by it so many times but don\u2019t let it win. It\u2019s just a stupid song. On Sunday Harry calls you, you almost don\u2019t answer but put your ego to the side. Work comes first. \u2018Hello, Ava Bentley speaking how can I help.\u2019 You say over cheerfully.</p><p>\u2018Ava, uhhh hi, it\u2019s Harry. Are you around?\u2019</p><p>You tense up. \u2018Yes I am.\u2019 You say hesitantly, you must admit you had considered lying. </p><p>\u2018Good, do you think you could come meet me at my studio, I actually added something more to the demo from last week I think you might like it.\u2019 He pushes</p><p>You glance at the clock on the wall and then at the usb sitting on your countertop. You sigh. \u2018Sure I\u2019ll be right over. You uh have to send me the address however I\u2019m not familiar.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018No problem see you soon.\u2019 Then dead air. You run upstairs and apply some makeup, pink lipstick has been traded for the red. You put your hair up in a ponytail with loose ends sticking out. Why you were concerned about how you looked around Harry bothered you more than it should. Even your clothing you took more time than usual. You had to steady your breathing on the way over, you hated the idea of being with Harry one on one for the first time in seven years. Sure you saw him a couple days ago but it was at work and you weren\u2019t completely alone. This was different, it was at his apartment. You knocked at his door and in 24 seconds it was flung open. \u2018Hi\u2019 he grinned at you.</p><p>\u2018Hi.\u2019 You return.</p><p>\u2018Come in Come in.\u2019 He stands aside to let you in. His apartment is too nice and you feel like a cheapskate in it, so out of place. </p><p>Rubbing your arms you turn full 360 to face him. \u2018So what is it you wanted to show me.\u2019 You shrug out of your coat which he takes and hangs up for you. He scratches the back of his neck before looking at you. \u2018Well, Uh it\u2019s not actually work related I just knew it was the only thing to get you to come over.\u2019 He says sheepishly.</p><p>You dropped your arms and look away</p><p>\u2018We aren\u2019t friends Harry, I\u2019m talking to you strictly for work purposes.\u2019 </p><p>He moves to your side touching your arm but you pull away.</p><p>\u2018Ava. Come just look.\u2019 His excitement returns. You can\u2019t help but feel a little bit curious.</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 You say</p><p>He guides you along the hallway to the dining room. He moves swiftly picking up a plate from the table and making his way back to you. He holds it up.</p><p>\u2018Oh my god.\u2019 You laugh staring at the dish. It was two choc chip cookies with finger bun frosting in the middle to make a sandwich.</p><p>\u2018Wow I haven\u2019t had one of these for years. God how do you even remember that?\u2019 You take the plate from him. He plays with the strings on his hoodie.</p><p>\u2018I make them every now and then, I mean how could I forget they were the highlight of our job bake at that bakery, apart from Mrs Miller..\u2019</p><p>\u2018You remember Mrs Miller!\u2019 You scoff.</p><p>Harry looks back up at you with a cheeky grin. \u2018You two bakery girls.\u2019 He imitates an old lady voice. You laugh and he can\u2019t help but laugh with you. You sigh and place the plate with the diabetes on the table. \u2018I didn\u2019t come here to eat cake and talk about old times. I mean it\u2019s been nice but I don\u2019t know what you want.\u2019 He looks pained as he thinks. \u2018I want things to go back to the way they were. I want to be friends again.\u2019 He puts forward slowly. </p><p>\u2018Harry.\u2019 You falter. \u2018I don\u2019t think I can do that.\u2019 His face falls and it pains you.</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019 His green eyes search your blue ones. You look away and walk back out to the hallway, he follows you.</p><p>\u2018Because.\u2019 You lock your eyes with his again. \u2018Because I loved you Harry, the sixteen year old girl I was. And when you left, you broke my heart. And I have spent years rebuilding it, and I\u2019m not willing to let you back in and tear it down again.\u2019 Hot tears started to fall down your face. He touches your hand but this just causes you to loose it even more. \u2018No.\u2019 You cry but it gets caught in your throat. You grab your coat from the hallway coat hanger.</p><p>\u2018I have to leave.\u2019 And he lets you.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"https://mhrowland.tumblr.com/post/174238919131/harry-styles-self-titled-series-ava-worked-with\">Part 4</a></p>",

From The Dining Table</b></p><p>The next few weeks you removed yourself from all the recording days choosing to only listen to them on your own and evaluate then discuss your opinion with Harry and Pip on meeting days. It was time for you to listen to another song, others had been written and put out into draft song form such as Carolina and Only Angel which you secretly digged (because they weren\u2019t about you). However I guess it was short lived because harry wasn\u2019t the best at subtly, lord he didn\u2019t even try it. You placed the headphone over your ears and the first few notes played, along came his warm voice. You closed your eyes. You hated how vulnerable his music made you feel, especially the one he wrote about you. This song was the exact same. But it also made you angry, you felt like harry was blaming you for everything when he was the one who stopped calling. It wasn\u2019t even like you were lovers or anything. Why was he writing so emotionally about you? I guess it\u2019s inspiring to think of it as lovers. You had loved him and that\u2019s probably why it hurt so much when he left. Goddamit, you sat in silence after listening to the song pondering the meaning over and over in your head. The sound of someone coughing startled you out of your thoughts. You pushed the headphones off you head and turned to find Harry leaning in the doorway. \u2018So what do you think?\u2019</p><p>He queried. You stared at him silently.</p><p>He frowned pushing away from the doorframe. \u2018I\u2019m not a monster, you can talk to me love.\u2019 He smiles that damn crooked smile.</p><p>\u2018Stop.\u2019 You say.</p><p>He stops. </p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 You shake your head. \u2018It\u2019s not fair.\u2019 You look at him and blink back tears.</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t blame it on me.\u2019 You stand up to face him, but being a measly 5\u20195 and him 5\u201911 he stood over you. </p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you dare say I didn\u2019t call you because I did, Harry. Everyday. You\u2019re the one who never answered or retuned them.\u2019</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u2018Whatever or whoever you\u2019re writing from.\u2019 You jab his chest with your finger. \u2018You need something new to motivate you.\u2019 You turn away so he doesn\u2019t see the tear spill from you eye. You wipe it away with the back of your hand. </p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 Harry spoke up. You turn around to face him again your blood boiling.</p><p>\u2018How the fuck would you not know. It was your own phone!\u2019 You spit at him and he flinches, not accustomed to this new found anger.</p><p>\u2018I never got any voice mails. And when I tried calling you someone else answered, you changed your number?\u2019 He started to get angry too. You stumble back confused.</p><p>\u2018What? I never changed my number, not for another five years at least.\u2019 </p><p>His face flicks from confusion back to anger before settling with confusion.</p><p>\u2018Well I dont know what happened but I wasn\u2019t avoiding you.\u2019 He said calmly breathing in and out and unclenching his jaw. You just stare at him. Again you feel tears prick your eyes. No. Not again. </p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll see you on Wednesday.\u2019 You mutter before grabbing your bag and heading out the door. \u2018Wait.\u2019 He calls. You stop but don\u2019t turn. He walks around to you and hands you the usb with the demo. \u2018You might want this.\u2019 You look ahead as he places the usb in your hand. His fingers cold on your skin. Making goosebumps appear from the contact. He walks back down the hall leaving you. You don\u2019t listen to the song again just let it sit on your counter top staring at you. You get tempted by it so many times but don\u2019t let it win. It\u2019s just a stupid song. On Sunday Harry calls you, you almost don\u2019t answer but put your ego to the side. Work comes first. \u2018Hello, Ava Bentley speaking how can I help.\u2019 You say over cheerfully.</p><p>\u2018Ava, uhhh hi, it\u2019s Harry. Are you around?\u2019</p><p>You tense up. \u2018Yes I am.\u2019 You say hesitantly, you must admit you had considered lying. </p><p>\u2018Good, do you think you could come meet me at my studio, I actually added something more to the demo from last week I think you might like it.\u2019 He pushes</p><p>You glance at the clock on the wall and then at the usb sitting on your countertop. You sigh. \u2018Sure I\u2019ll be right over. You uh have to send me the address however I\u2019m not familiar.\u2019 </p><p>\u2018No problem see you soon.\u2019 Then dead air. You run upstairs and apply some makeup, pink lipstick has been traded for the red. You put your hair up in a ponytail with loose ends sticking out. Why you were concerned about how you looked around Harry bothered you more than it should. Even your clothing you took more time than usual. You had to steady your breathing on the way over, you hated the idea of being with Harry one on one for the first time in seven years. Sure you saw him a couple days ago but it was at work and you weren\u2019t completely alone. This was different, it was at his apartment. You knocked at his door and in 24 seconds it was flung open. \u2018Hi\u2019 he grinned at you.</p><p>\u2018Hi.\u2019 You return.</p><p>\u2018Come in Come in.\u2019 He stands aside to let you in. His apartment is too nice and you feel like a cheapskate in it, so out of place. </p><p>Rubbing your arms you turn full 360 to face him. \u2018So what is it you wanted to show me.\u2019 You shrug out of your coat which he takes and hangs up for you. He scratches the back of his neck before looking at you. \u2018Well, Uh it\u2019s not actually work related I just knew it was the only thing to get you to come over.\u2019 He says sheepishly.</p><p>You dropped your arms and look away</p><p>\u2018We aren\u2019t friends Harry, I\u2019m talking to you strictly for work purposes.\u2019 </p><p>He moves to your side touching your arm but you pull away.</p><p>\u2018Ava. Come just look.\u2019 His excitement returns. You can\u2019t help but feel a little bit curious.</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 You say</p><p>He guides you along the hallway to the dining room. He moves swiftly picking up a plate from the table and making his way back to you. He holds it up.</p><p>\u2018Oh my god.\u2019 You laugh staring at the dish. It was two choc chip cookies with finger bun frosting in the middle to make a sandwich.</p><p>\u2018Wow I haven\u2019t had one of these for years. God how do you even remember that?\u2019 You take the plate from him. He plays with the strings on his hoodie.</p><p>\u2018I make them every now and then, I mean how could I forget they were the highlight of our job bake at that bakery, apart from Mrs Miller..\u2019</p><p>\u2018You remember Mrs Miller!\u2019 You scoff.</p><p>Harry looks back up at you with a cheeky grin. \u2018You two bakery girls.\u2019 He imitates an old lady voice. You laugh and he can\u2019t help but laugh with you. You sigh and place the plate with the diabetes on the table. \u2018I didn\u2019t come here to eat cake and talk about old times. I mean it\u2019s been nice but I don\u2019t know what you want.\u2019 He looks pained as he thinks. \u2018I want things to go back to the way they were. I want to be friends again.\u2019 He puts forward slowly. </p><p>\u2018Harry.\u2019 You falter. \u2018I don\u2019t think I can do that.\u2019 His face falls and it pains you.</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019 His green eyes search your blue ones. You look away and walk back out to the hallway, he follows you.</p><p>\u2018Because.\u2019 You lock your eyes with his again. \u2018Because I loved you Harry, the sixteen year old girl I was. And when you left, you broke my heart. And I have spent years rebuilding it, and I\u2019m not willing to let you back in and tear it down again.\u2019 Hot tears started to fall down your face. He touches your hand but this just causes you to loose it even more. \u2018No.\u2019 You cry but it gets caught in your throat. You grab your coat from the hallway coat hanger.</p><p>\u2018I have to leave.\u2019 And he lets you.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://mhrowland.tumblr.com/post/174238919131/harry-styles-self-titled-series-ava-worked-with\">Part 4</a></p></p>",
