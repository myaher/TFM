We\u2019ve been sleeping on th\u2019 fuckin\u2019 ground getting eaten alive by all sortsa bugs for six days. It\u2019s a room, it\u2019s a bed\u2014\u201c Bucky tore the cap off a warm beer and took a long drink, grimacing at the taste. \u201c\u2014 so I\u2019m gonna pound this piss poor excuse for beer and pass out against that shitty lookin\u2019 pillow. You\u2019re more than welcome to sleep on the floor if you\u2019re gonna be weird about it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m just saying it seems a little\u2026\u201d Steve cleared his throat again. \u201c&hellip; I mean, after what happened I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to be around me? Feels like things are maybe a little&ndash;\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWe has to snuggle for warmth.\u201d Bucky interrupted. \u201cIt was raining, it was fuckin\u2019 freezing, we needed body warmth, it is what it is. We got all cuddled up, you got a little morning wood, ended up humping me a little, it happens. We\u2019re guys. Stop being stupid about it.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBUCKY!\u201d Steve turned bright red. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I mean to do&ndash; to do that!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Stevie.\u201d A look Steve had never seen before flickered through Bucky\u2019s eyes. \u201cWasn\u2019t like I pushed you away, you know?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI guess you didn&rsquo;t.\u201d Steve said awkwardly, remembering in vivid detail how Bucky had grabbed at him for just a few seconds, how the metal fingers had felt digging into his thigh and pulling him into Bucky\u2019s body again. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. No reason for things to be weird, we\u2019ll share a bed and I\u2019ll try not to uh&ndash; to rub against you tonight.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bucky didn\u2019t say anything to that, but his gaze dropped over Steve\u2019s body, lingering below his waist until Steve started shifting nervously. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWell then.\u201d Bucky finally said. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower, I\u2019ll save you some water.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve dropped onto the bed, and then jumped right back up, somehow turning an even brighter shade of red, mortified over the direction his thoughts had suddenly gone, the thought of sharing a real bed with Bucky enough to make him&ndash;</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou got a real stupid look on your face right now, Stevie.\u201d Bucky cracked a grin. \u201cStop over thinkin\u2019 it, huh?\u201d</i></p></blockquote><!-- more --><p>Bucky whistled out loud, kicking at Steve\u2019s leg. \u201cBabe, you are a whiny <i>bitch </i>in this one. We gotta share a bed and you are all fucked up coz we snuggled a little the night before and you got some morning wood. Just as awkward as can be. I\u2019m noticing a recurring theme in these \u2018one bed\u2019 fics? You got some real issues fessin\u2019 up to wanting to get nekkid with me. Apparently I\u2019m down to do the dirty with you, but you wanna hold onto that All American heterosexuality.\u201d </p><p>He waggled his eyebrows at his boyfriend. \u201cI never knew you were so self-oppressed, Stevie. Was it hard for you to get into bed with me? Had to close your eyes and think of America to get through it all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know damn well I\u2019ve never been All American hetero.\u201d Steve kicked him back, then stretched out on the couch, wiggling his toes until Bucky\u2019s left hand landed at his heel, the cool metal fingers already moving in an easy foot rub. \u201cPretty sure the first time we were naked together it was cos I was ripping your clothes off anyway.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe first time we got naked together you were almost dying.\u201d Bucky corrected. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t nothing fun about it. No ripping of clothes, no morning wood, no gratuitous humpin\u2019, nothing. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Steve\u2019s smile was a little sad. \u201cThe year I got pneumonia and the heat went out in the building. We burned th\u2019 chairs remember? Burned them in the stove for a little bit of heat. We had to share the blankets, sleep almost naked to keep me warm, you had to hold me down so I wouldn\u2019t shiver.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood times. Don\u2019t miss it at all.\u201d Bucky ran his thumb firmly over the arch in Steve\u2019s foot. \u201cThink we shared a bed every night after that, though huh? Weren\u2019t no reason to go back to sleeping separately once we\u2019d started sleeping together?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure wasn\u2019t.\u201d The look they shared was soft and sweet and full of a million memories. \u201cTook us a while to get back to same bed this time around, but we made it again, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah Stevie, we made it. Right back where we belong.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo what happens in the fic then?\u201d Steve said after a moment, motioning to Bucky&rsquo;s phone. \u201cDo we end up sharing a bed? End up getting naked together? What happens?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that sort of ending is a given with this trope.\u201d Raised eyebrows as Bucky scrolled a little further through the fic. \u201cWell would you look at <i>that</i>. For bein\u2019 so shy about poking me with your morning rise and shine, you sure enjoy it later on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Steve perked up a little, putting down his crossword puzzle and sitting up. \u201cDo I top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right, because <i>you\u2019re</i> going to top in a fic where I gotta talk you through a big gay crisis before we can share a bed. What are you thinking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, let me read it.\u201d Steve snatched for the phone, more interested than he wanted to admit over a sexy scene where Bucky topped.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t <i>thought </i>about it, after all. Bucky was gorgeous and Steve would let him do anything he wanted in bed. Bucky had never asked to top, so Steve had never offered but maybe if he read some fic and got some ideas\u2026.</p><p>\u201cLet me read it!\u201d he said in exasperation when Bucky frowned at him. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got to read a bottom <i>me </i>fic at some point, right? I\u2019d rather it be this one than that subby one you were reading where I was wearing a collar.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, but I didn\u2019t actually read that one, I got weirded out when you called me <i>Sir </i>and I called you <i>puppy</i>.\u201d Bucky crowded his phone to his chest so Steve couldn\u2019t see the screen. \u201cHonestly, thank God for a back button. And besides, you don\u2019t get to make fun of me for reading this stuff and then ask questions about it! That\u2019s not how it works!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it!\u201d Steve twisted around and lunged onto Bucky, grappling at the phone until they both fell off the couch and onto the floor. \u201cLet me see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your own fic!\u201d Bucky hollered, holding the phone above his head and wrapping his legs around Steve\u2019s waist, squeezing tight so the blonde couldn\u2019t get any closer. \u201cYou have a phone! Read your own shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit Bucky!\u201d Steve planted his hands on the floor and rolled a few times, breaking Bucky&rsquo;s hold around his waist and scrambling up his boyfriends body to get to the phone. \u201cI just want to see it! Just let me\u2014!\u201d </p><p>They both froze when the living room door swished open and Tony stepped through, the dark eyed genius sending them an amused smile as he took in their more-than-slightly compromising position, Bucky with his legs spread and Steve for all intents and purposes rather roughly pinning him to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole gym downstairs if you boys wanted to wrestle.\u201d Tony said good naturedly. \u201cOr you know, a bedroom upstairs if you wanted to <i>wrassle</i>.\u201d he exaggerated the last word, wiggling his eyebrows in their direction.</p><p>\u201cUh, this isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d Steve said lamely, gesturing between their bodies. \u201cHonest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest.\u201d Bucky repeated, outright chucking his phone across the room so Tony wouldn\u2019t catch a glimpse of what was in the screen. \u201cAlso\u2014\u201c he flinched when it shattered on the wall. \u201c\u2014Also I might need a new phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d Tony glanced at the pieces of the now ruined phone. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, I needed a new project and designing tech that super soldiers can\u2019t shatter could be a fun one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d Steve scrambled to his feet, hauling Bucky up with him. \u201cAnyway um\u2014 how are you? How\u2019s your day going?\u201d His smile was a bit goofy, and so was Bucky&rsquo;s, the latter shoving his hands in his pocket and flushing a soft pink. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Tony was trying not to laugh at them, but for two serum jacked super soldiers good <i>god </i>were they dorky. \u201cI was going to deliver this for Bucky.\u201d He held up a new tablet. \u201cBut after seeing what just happened with the phone, maybe I\u2019ll take it back and reinforce it a few dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, listen.\u201d Bucky elbowed Steve lightly and the blonde gave him a quick nod of encouragement. \u201cWe um\u2014 we had a <i>really </i>great time with you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Steve agreed. \u201cA really great time, Tony. Dinner was awesome, the restaurant was super cool and you know&ndash; we should do it again sometime. <i>Soon</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Tony looked up from whatever he was doing on Bucky&rsquo;s tablet to give them a bright smile. \u201cAnytime guys, let me know. I\u2019ll bring Sam or something, we can make a whole night of it. Could be really fun.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh not <i>Sam</i>.\u201d Bucky muttered and when Tony&rsquo;s brow wrinkled he hastened to add, \u201cNot that we don&rsquo;t love Sam. Boy howdy, do we love Sam. Seriously. Love that guy to death.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBoy howdy?\u201d Steve whispered and Bucky shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWhat he means is, maybe just the three of us could do something.\u201d Steve clarified. \u201cYou know, dinner or a movie or something like that. Or you could just come along on one of our regular date nights? Whatever you want. It could be really really fun, Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne of your regular date nights.\u201d What had looked like a spark of interest in Tony&rsquo;s eyes faded away to resignation. \u201cYeah. Sure. That sounds like it might be fun, sure. I\u2019ll go make a few adjustments to this tablet Buck, and then I\u2019ll give it right back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;sure.\u201d Bucky said slowly, and after Tony turned and left rather abruptly, he asked, \u201cUh, what did we just do wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d Steve frowned at the door Tony had gone through. \u201cI mean, we told him we had a good time, we invited him along for any and all date nights. I dunno what we did wrong. Maybe he\u2019s just not interested? I feel like that was a pretty strong hint.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be interested in us?\u201d Bucky sounded entirely offended. \u201cWe\u2019re a catch, right? Two super soldiers? Besides he had a lot of fun last night! He was all flirty and cute and I swear he wanted you to kiss him goodnight, Stevie. No one puts on chapstick right before saying goodnight unless they want a kiss.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI kinda thought he wanted a kiss too, but then he ducked into his room.\u201d Steve thought for a few seconds. \u201cAnd we <i>are </i>a catch, but I gotta say, you destroying your phone in front of him probably didn\u2019t earn us any brownie points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not my smoothest moment.\u201d Bucky agreed sheepishly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want him to see me reading sexy things. That feels like something I\u2019ll admit after we\u2019ve been dating a while or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell unless we get a whole lot more obvious, we won\u2019t ever <i>be </i>dating Tony.\u201d Steve blew out a breath, then sent Bucky a side-ways look. \u201cThat fic was sexy enough that you woulda been embarrassed for Tony to read it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sorta was.\u201d</p><p>Steve dug his own phone out of his pocket and handed it to Bucky. \u201cCan you find it again?\u201d</p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>\u201cOne coffee, just the way you like it.\u201d Steve placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of Bucky, running his hand purposefully over the front of Bucky\u2019s trousers before purring in his ear, \u201cWith lots of extra <i>cream</i>.\u201d </p><p>The words were quiet, but apparently not quiet enough, because across the table Clint spit his coffee out all over himself and all over Natasha, who had been perched on his lap nibbling at her breakfast. </p><p>\u201c<i>Clint</i>!\u201d she screeched, and Clint started grabbing at napkins, mopping drops from her face and hair as fast as he could.\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart.\u201d he apologized over and over. \u201cI thought Cap said something super awkward and dear god I hope I misheard him&ndash;\u201d he shot Steve a look just shy of horrified. \u201c&ndash;and it startled me. Sorry, so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Tasha cursed again, hopping off his lap. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really want to wear this shirt anyway. Come on love, help me pick out another one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, babe.\u201d Clint tossed the napkins on the table and followed her from the room, glaring at Steve and Bucky as he went. </p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d Bucky scolded, and Steve ducked his head to mutter, \u201cI am fucking ashamed of myself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean did you really tell me you had my coffee with extra cream?\u201d He stared down at his cup suspiciously. \u201cPlease tell me you meant real cream. You meant <i>real </i>cream right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I meant real cream.\u201d Steve said grumpily. \u201cI just thought it would be funny. Didn\u2019t mean for Clint to hear. All the mornings for him to actually have his hearing aids in? Usually he doesn\u2019t bother wearing them until nine am!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn what universe is saying cream while whispering and touching me like that funny?\u201d Bucky retorted. \u201cThat sounds like something out of a&ndash;\u201d his expression cleared. \u201cYou discovered coffee shop au\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many of them!\u201d Steve took a drink of Bucky\u2019s coffee and dropped into the chair next to him. \u201cWho knew there were so many ways to fall in love with a barista!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, but we must be reading different coffee shop fics because I have yet to come across one where <i>cream </i>didn\u2019t mean <i>cream</i>.\u201d Bucky narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat rating are you reading?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was a\u2026\u201d Steve coughed, shifted in his seat and coughed again. Folded his arms, unfolded them to scratch at his chin, crossed his legs and drummed his fingers on his knee. \u201cIt was a slightly kinky one. Probably.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSlightly kinky.\u201d Bucky opened his phone to the now-bookmarked AO3 page and scrolled through his current page of coffee shop au\u2019s. \u201cOkay, none of these look kinky, Steve. What the hell are you&ndash;\u201d </p><p>His voice trailed off when he found a rather incriminating story and Steve blushed a <i>very </i>incriminating shade of red. </p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Bucky said bluntly. \u201cFor the love of fuck. Are you serious?\u201d </p><p>Steve buried his face in his hands, hiding away from the judgement in Bucky\u2019s eyes as he scrolled through the fic, reading out loud in a barely there whisper, something no one but Steve would overhear. </p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDo you take cream in your coffee?\u201d Steve asked from the kitchen, and Bucky managed a negative sound over the gag in his mouth. \u201cNo? I feel like I don\u2019t remember you drinking it black last time.\u201d \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Steve put his own cup down on the end table and crossed to where Bucky was still kneeling on the pillow, head tipped back so all that beautiful hair spilled down his shoulders, blue grey eyes half closed, hands tied behind his back. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful like this.\u201d Steve murmured, and a shudder went through Bucky\u2019s body. \u201cWho knew I\u2019d find someone like you just because the barista got our coffee orders mixed up?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Gentle fingers eased the gag from Bucky\u2019s mouth, and Steve ran his thumb over the soft pink lips. \u201cDo you need a drink?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cActually.\u201d Bucky\u2019s tongue flicked out over Steve\u2019s thumb. \u201cActually I was thinking I would take some cream. I changed my mind. Is that alright?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Steve started to frown, but it fell into a gasp when Bucky leaned forward just enough to mouth over his still clothed cock, soaking the front of his shorts with spit and moaning loudly enough that Steve could feel the vibrations in his core. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNaughty boy.\u201d he breathed and Bucky went back on his heels, mouth falling open lewdly, his own cock starting to twitch and fill where it lay against his bare thigh. </i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease, Stevie.\u201d Bucky whined, high and anxious, peering up at Steve from beneath thick eyelashes. \u201cPlease can I have some cream with my coffee?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOpen up.\u201d Steve pushed his briefs down his legs, guided the tip of his heavy cock to rest on Bucky&rsquo;s tongue. \u201cYou know how I like it.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d Bucky tossed the phone away and snorted a laugh. \u201cStevie, the fuck? Do you really&ndash;?\u201d his eyes widened when he saw how uncomfortable Steve was, chewing at his lip, eyes bright with longing and maybe a little nervousness. </p><p>\u201cStevie?\u201d Bucky asked again and Steve made a soft sort of eager noise, his legs falling open so Bucky could see the outline of his cock straining against the denim. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d he said slowly, and picked the phone back up.</p><blockquote><p><i>The noise Bucky made as inch after inch of Steve filled his mouth was obscene, the bulge in his cheek as he strained around the thick length beautiful in a twisted sort of way. </i></p><p><i>Steve wasn\u2019t all the way in when the head met the back of Bucky\u2019s tongue, but the brunette took a deep breath in through his nose and let his jaw fall open even more until Steve was buried in his throat. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFuck, look at the way you take me.\u201d Steve groaned, cupping Bucky\u2019s jaw with his hand, his fingers pressing experimentally when he could feel his own bulk straining in Bucky\u2019s throat. \u201cThis is where you\u2019re supposed to be yeah, on your knees like this?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bucky couldn\u2019t move enough to even nod, but his eyes opened wide in acknowledgement and then fell closed, the muscles of his throat squeezing as he tried to swallow, a mumbled, muffled moan when he could taste the first pulse of liquid from the tip of Steve\u2019s cock. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTaste good?\u201d Steve wanted to know, withdrawing enough so Bucky could nod, smiling knowingly when Bucky chased it with a whine, sucking and slurping over the drooling slit to catch as much as he could. \u201cYeah that&rsquo;s right, don\u2019t waste a single drop.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWant you to fuck me.\u201d Bucky spoke between licking long stripes up the sensitive skin, suckling over the head and smearing the precome over his lips. \u201cFuck my throat. I\u2019ll swallow all of it, I promise.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right you will.\u201d Steve\u2019s blue eyes looked almost black in the early morning light, his gaze nothing less than possessive as he wove thick fingers into Bucky\u2019s long hair. \u201cHow long can you hold your breath?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cLong enough to make you come.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d Bucky decided in an instant and Steve jumped to his feet, already grabbing for him. \u201cCome on. Maybe I do want some cream with my coffee.\u201d </p><p>***************</p><p>***************</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBucky?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Steve.\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was raw and hoarse, deeper than Steve remembered, empty of that swaggering Brooklyn drawl, but still so familiar that Steve could have cried right then and there.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBeen lookin\u2019 for you, Buck.\u201d he managed, hands clenching at his sides because he didn\u2019t know if he could reach out and touch yet. \u201cBeen lookin\u2019 for you for a long time.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou found me?\u201d It was a question, heartbreaking in it\u2019s simplicity, Bucky still not sure that it was real. \u201cStevie you found me.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI told you.\u201d Steve took a step closer, a tremble starting somewhere in his core and spreading to his fingers. \u201cI told you, till the end of the line Buck.

You finally finished that fic?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve felt foolish for crying over a story, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. \u201cY\u2019know there\u2019s a million different fics on here about the moment I found you again? And none of them are exactly right, I mean we definitely didn\u2019t get naked on some gross floor in an abandoned warehouse&ndash;\u201d\u00a0Bucky laughed quietly and held him a little tighter. \u201cBut they are all sort of true anyway.

Or eight, because good Lord do you two need some help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNext time you scare me like that I\u2019m gonna hurt you.\u201d Bucky grumbled and Sam clucked at him in disapproval. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon now, that isn\u2019t anyway to treat the man who\u2019s going to make sure you don\u2019t embarrass yourself in front of Tony anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do mean embarrass ourselves?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cAnd which one am I?

Stop talking to Tony like you guys are quoting lines from some terrible porno and maybe he wouldn\u2019t run to the kitchen to escape the ball of awkward you\u2019ve turned the conversation into.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t talking like we were in a porno!\u201d Bucky protested, but Sam only made a \u2018uh huh, sure\u2019 sort of noise and clapped them on the shoulders, disappearing to find his own seat. \u201cWe weren\u2019t we talking like we were in a porno, were we Stevie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cEven though, I guess the whole shower line was a little weird?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell what about your whole \u2018imagine seeing you here\u2019 line? We live in the same building!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t half as bad as your \u2018guess we will have to cuddle\u2019!\u201d Steve defended. \u201cWhy would you even say something like that?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno, it worked in a story I&ndash;\u201d Bucky\u2019s mouth fell open, a horrified expression on his face. \u201cOh dear god, are we quoting fan fiction when we talk to Tony now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo we aren\u2019t&ndash;\u201d Steve stopped, thought about it for a minute. \u201cYep.

I fully expected the delivery guy to make a comment about taking something <i>else </i>for a tip.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>WHAT</i>?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was some au where you were a starving theater kid who delivered pizza for extra money and I was your sugar daddy.\u201d Bucky waved him off. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019s sorta starting to affect real life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe we could just scale it down to right before bed?\u201d Steve said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to read about ourselves, you know? We fall in love in every single one of these universes and I dunno, I think it makes me love you a little more.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt makes me love you more too.\u201d Bucky leaned over and captured his mouth in a sweet, slow kiss. \u201cBut when we start using weird come on\u2019s with Tony and fucking <i>Sam </i>notices? Something\u2019s gotta give.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Steve sounded reluctant. \u201cOnly before bed, no more weird lines with Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hey real quick&ndash;\u201d Bucky lowered his voice when Tony came back with a bowl of popcorn. \u201cHave you come across anything called ABO yet? It came up in a tag and I don\u2019t know what it is. Seems intense.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find some tonight.\u201d Steve said quickly, and scooted back over to make room for Tony between them. \u201cWe\u2019ve read some pretty weird stuff, ABO can\u2019t be much weirder, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight, we can handle it.\u201d </p><p>*********************</p><p>*********************</p><p>Both tablets and phones sat unused for a full day and a half after Steve and Bucky searched through the ABO tag. </p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t handle that.\u201d Steve admitted at the end of day two. </p><p>\u201cSo many words ruined for me.\u201d Bucky said mournfully. \u201cAlpha, beta, omega. Knot. Heat.\u00a0<i>Slick</i>. I can\u2019t even have a conversation anymore without feelin\u2019 like I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about something weird! Clint said the floor was slick the other day and I almost died!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought the knot part of it was okay.\u201d Steve said hesitantly. \u201cSeems sorta fun.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe fun for someone who <i>tops</i>!\u201d Bucky shouted, waving his hands about wildly. \u201cI\u2019m the asshole that has to take the damn thing! Fuck off outta here with that knot business!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are they yelling about?\u201d Natasha asked as she and Clint passed outside the bedroom door. \u201cTying <i>knots</i>?\u201d </p><p>Clint just rolled his eyes. \u201cWho the hell knows? Super soldiers are weird.\u201d </p><p>************************</p>",

We gotta share a bed and you are all fucked up coz we snuggled a little the night before and you got some morning wood. Just as awkward as can be. I\u2019m noticing a recurring theme in these \u2018one bed\u2019 fics? You got some real issues fessin\u2019 up to wanting to get nekkid with me. Apparently I\u2019m down to do the dirty with you, but you wanna hold onto that All American heterosexuality.\u201d </p><p>He waggled his eyebrows at his boyfriend. \u201cI never knew you were so self-oppressed, Stevie. Was it hard for you to get into bed with me? Had to close your eyes and think of America to get through it all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know damn well I\u2019ve never been All American hetero.\u201d Steve kicked him back, then stretched out on the couch, wiggling his toes until Bucky\u2019s left hand landed at his heel, the cool metal fingers already moving in an easy foot rub. \u201cPretty sure the first time we were naked together it was cos I was ripping your clothes off anyway.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe first time we got naked together you were almost dying.\u201d Bucky corrected. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t nothing fun about it. No ripping of clothes, no morning wood, no gratuitous humpin\u2019, nothing. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Steve\u2019s smile was a little sad. \u201cThe year I got pneumonia and the heat went out in the building. We burned th\u2019 chairs remember? Burned them in the stove for a little bit of heat. We had to share the blankets, sleep almost naked to keep me warm, you had to hold me down so I wouldn\u2019t shiver.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood times. Don\u2019t miss it at all.\u201d Bucky ran his thumb firmly over the arch in Steve\u2019s foot. \u201cThink we shared a bed every night after that, though huh? Weren\u2019t no reason to go back to sleeping separately once we\u2019d started sleeping together?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure wasn\u2019t.\u201d The look they shared was soft and sweet and full of a million memories. \u201cTook us a while to get back to same bed this time around, but we made it again, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah Stevie, we made it. Right back where we belong.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo what happens in the fic then?\u201d Steve said after a moment, motioning to Bucky\u2019s phone. \u201cDo we end up sharing a bed? End up getting naked together? What happens?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that sort of ending is a given with this trope.\u201d Raised eyebrows as Bucky scrolled a little further through the fic. \u201cWell would you look at <i>that</i>. For bein\u2019 so shy about poking me with your morning rise and shine, you sure enjoy it later on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Steve perked up a little, putting down his crossword puzzle and sitting up. \u201cDo I top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right, because <i>you\u2019re</i> going to top in a fic where I gotta talk you through a big gay crisis before we can share a bed. What are you thinking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, let me read it.\u201d Steve snatched for the phone, more interested than he wanted to admit over a sexy scene where Bucky topped.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t <i>thought </i>about it, after all. Bucky was gorgeous and Steve would let him do anything he wanted in bed. Bucky had never asked to top, so Steve had never offered but maybe if he read some fic and got some ideas\u2026.</p><p>\u201cLet me read it!\u201d he said in exasperation when Bucky frowned at him. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got to read a bottom <i>me </i>fic at some point, right? I\u2019d rather it be this one than that subby one you were reading where I was wearing a collar.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, but I didn\u2019t actually read that one, I got weirded out when you called me <i>Sir </i>and I called you <i>puppy</i>.\u201d Bucky crowded his phone to his chest so Steve couldn\u2019t see the screen. \u201cHonestly, thank God for a back button. And besides, you don\u2019t get to make fun of me for reading this stuff and then ask questions about it! That\u2019s not how it works!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it!\u201d Steve twisted around and lunged onto Bucky, grappling at the phone until they both fell off the couch and onto the floor. \u201cLet me see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your own fic!\u201d Bucky hollered, holding the phone above his head and wrapping his legs around Steve\u2019s waist, squeezing tight so the blonde couldn\u2019t get any closer. \u201cYou have a phone! Read your own shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit Bucky!\u201d Steve planted his hands on the floor and rolled a few times, breaking Bucky\u2019s hold around his waist and scrambling up his boyfriends body to get to the phone. \u201cI just want to see it! Just let me\u2014!\u201d </p><p>They both froze when the living room door swished open and Tony stepped through, the dark eyed genius sending them an amused smile as he took in their more-than-slightly compromising position, Bucky with his legs spread and Steve for all intents and purposes rather roughly pinning him to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole gym downstairs if you boys wanted to wrestle.\u201d Tony said good naturedly. \u201cOr you know, a bedroom upstairs if you wanted to <i>wrassle</i>.\u201d he exaggerated the last word, wiggling his eyebrows in their direction.</p><p>\u201cUh, this isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d Steve said lamely, gesturing between their bodies. \u201cHonest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest.\u201d Bucky repeated, outright chucking his phone across the room so Tony wouldn\u2019t catch a glimpse of what was in the screen. \u201cAlso\u2014\u201c he flinched when it shattered on the wall. \u201c\u2014Also I might need a new phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d Tony glanced at the pieces of the now ruined phone. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, I needed a new project and designing tech that super soldiers can\u2019t shatter could be a fun one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d Steve scrambled to his feet, hauling Bucky up with him. \u201cAnyway um\u2014 how are you? How\u2019s your day going?\u201d His smile was a bit goofy, and so was Bucky\u2019s, the latter shoving his hands in his pocket and flushing a soft pink. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Tony was trying not to laugh at them, but for two serum jacked super soldiers good <i>god </i>were they dorky. \u201cI was going to deliver this for Bucky.\u201d He held up a new tablet. \u201cBut after seeing what just happened with the phone, maybe I\u2019ll take it back and reinforce it a few dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, listen.\u201d Bucky elbowed Steve lightly and the blonde gave him a quick nod of encouragement. \u201cWe um\u2014 we had a <i>really </i>great time with you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Steve agreed. \u201cA really great time, Tony. Dinner was awesome, the restaurant was super cool and you know\u2013 we should do it again sometime. <i>Soon</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Tony looked up from whatever he was doing on Bucky\u2019s tablet to give them a bright smile. \u201cAnytime guys, let me know. I\u2019ll bring Sam or something, we can make a whole night of it. Could be really fun.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh not <i>Sam</i>.\u201d Bucky muttered and when Tony\u2019s brow wrinkled he hastened to add, \u201cNot that we don\u2019t love Sam. Boy howdy, do we love Sam. Seriously. Love that guy to death.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBoy howdy?\u201d Steve whispered and Bucky shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWhat he means is, maybe just the three of us could do something.\u201d Steve clarified. \u201cYou know, dinner or a movie or something like that. Or you could just come along on one of our regular date nights? Whatever you want. It could be really really fun, Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne of your regular date nights.\u201d What had looked like a spark of interest in Tony\u2019s eyes faded away to resignation. \u201cYeah. Sure. That sounds like it might be fun, sure. I\u2019ll go make a few adjustments to this tablet Buck, and then I\u2019ll give it right back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026sure.\u201d Bucky said slowly, and after Tony turned and left rather abruptly, he asked, \u201cUh, what did we just do wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d Steve frowned at the door Tony had gone through. \u201cI mean, we told him we had a good time, we invited him along for any and all date nights. I dunno what we did wrong. Maybe he\u2019s just not interested? I feel like that was a pretty strong hint.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be interested in us?\u201d Bucky sounded entirely offended. \u201cWe\u2019re a catch, right? Two super soldiers? Besides he had a lot of fun last night! He was all flirty and cute and I swear he wanted you to kiss him goodnight, Stevie. No one puts on chapstick right before saying goodnight unless they want a kiss.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI kinda thought he wanted a kiss too, but then he ducked into his room.\u201d Steve thought for a few seconds. \u201cAnd we <i>are </i>a catch, but I gotta say, you destroying your phone in front of him probably didn\u2019t earn us any brownie points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not my smoothest moment.\u201d Bucky agreed sheepishly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want him to see me reading sexy things. That feels like something I\u2019ll admit after we\u2019ve been dating a while or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell unless we get a whole lot more obvious, we won\u2019t ever <i>be </i>dating Tony.\u201d Steve blew out a breath, then sent Bucky a side-ways look. \u201cThat fic was sexy enough that you woulda been embarrassed for Tony to read it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sorta was.\u201d</p><p>Steve dug his own phone out of his pocket and handed it to Bucky. \u201cCan you find it again?\u201d</p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>\u201cOne coffee, just the way you like it.\u201d Steve placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of Bucky, running his hand purposefully over the front of Bucky\u2019s trousers before purring in his ear, \u201cWith lots of extra <i>cream</i>.\u201d </p><p>The words were quiet, but apparently not quiet enough, because across the table Clint spit his coffee out all over himself and all over Natasha, who had been perched on his lap nibbling at her breakfast. </p><p>\u201c<i>Clint</i>!\u201d she screeched, and Clint started grabbing at napkins, mopping drops from her face and hair as fast as he could.\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart.\u201d he apologized over and over. \u201cI thought Cap said something super awkward and dear god I hope I misheard him\u2013\u201d he shot Steve a look just shy of horrified. \u201c\u2013and it startled me. Sorry, so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Tasha cursed again, hopping off his lap. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really want to wear this shirt anyway. Come on love, help me pick out another one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, babe.\u201d Clint tossed the napkins on the table and followed her from the room, glaring at Steve and Bucky as he went. </p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d Bucky scolded, and Steve ducked his head to mutter, \u201cI am fucking ashamed of myself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean did you really tell me you had my coffee with extra cream?\u201d He stared down at his cup suspiciously. \u201cPlease tell me you meant real cream. You meant <i>real </i>cream right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I meant real cream.\u201d Steve said grumpily. \u201cI just thought it would be funny. Didn\u2019t mean for Clint to hear. All the mornings for him to actually have his hearing aids in? Usually he doesn\u2019t bother wearing them until nine am!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn what universe is saying cream while whispering and touching me like that funny?\u201d Bucky retorted. \u201cThat sounds like something out of a\u2013\u201d his expression cleared. \u201cYou discovered coffee shop au\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many of them!\u201d Steve took a drink of Bucky\u2019s coffee and dropped into the chair next to him. \u201cWho knew there were so many ways to fall in love with a barista!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, but we must be reading different coffee shop fics because I have yet to come across one where <i>cream </i>didn\u2019t mean <i>cream</i>.\u201d Bucky narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat rating are you reading?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was a\u2026\u201d Steve coughed, shifted in his seat and coughed again. Folded his arms, unfolded them to scratch at his chin, crossed his legs and drummed his fingers on his knee. \u201cIt was a slightly kinky one. Probably.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSlightly kinky.\u201d Bucky opened his phone to the now-bookmarked AO3 page and scrolled through his current page of coffee shop au\u2019s. \u201cOkay, none of these look kinky, Steve. What the hell are you\u2013\u201d </p><p>His voice trailed off when he found a rather incriminating story and Steve blushed a <i>very </i>incriminating shade of red. </p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Bucky said bluntly. \u201cFor the love of fuck. Are you serious?\u201d </p><p>Steve buried his face in his hands, hiding away from the judgement in Bucky\u2019s eyes as he scrolled through the fic, reading out loud in a barely there whisper, something no one but Steve would overhear. </p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDo you take cream in your coffee?\u201d Steve asked from the kitchen, and Bucky managed a negative sound over the gag in his mouth. \u201cNo? I feel like I don\u2019t remember you drinking it black last time.\u201d \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Steve put his own cup down on the end table and crossed to where Bucky was still kneeling on the pillow, head tipped back so all that beautiful hair spilled down his shoulders, blue grey eyes half closed, hands tied behind his back. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful like this.\u201d Steve murmured, and a shudder went through Bucky\u2019s body. \u201cWho knew I\u2019d find someone like you just because the barista got our coffee orders mixed up?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Gentle fingers eased the gag from Bucky\u2019s mouth, and Steve ran his thumb over the soft pink lips. \u201cDo you need a drink?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cActually.\u201d Bucky\u2019s tongue flicked out over Steve\u2019s thumb. \u201cActually I was thinking I would take some cream. I changed my mind. Is that alright?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Steve started to frown, but it fell into a gasp when Bucky leaned forward just enough to mouth over his still clothed cock, soaking the front of his shorts with spit and moaning loudly enough that Steve could feel the vibrations in his core. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNaughty boy.\u201d he breathed and Bucky went back on his heels, mouth falling open lewdly, his own cock starting to twitch and fill where it lay against his bare thigh. </i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease, Stevie.\u201d Bucky whined, high and anxious, peering up at Steve from beneath thick eyelashes. \u201cPlease can I have some cream with my coffee?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOpen up.\u201d Steve pushed his briefs down his legs, guided the tip of his heavy cock to rest on Bucky\u2019s tongue. \u201cYou know how I like it.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d Bucky tossed the phone away and snorted a laugh. \u201cStevie, the fuck? Do you really\u2013?\u201d his eyes widened when he saw how uncomfortable Steve was, chewing at his lip, eyes bright with longing and maybe a little nervousness. </p><p>\u201cStevie?\u201d Bucky asked again and Steve made a soft sort of eager noise, his legs falling open so Bucky could see the outline of his cock straining against the denim. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d he said slowly, and picked the phone back up.</p><blockquote><p><i>The noise Bucky made as inch after inch of Steve filled his mouth was obscene, the bulge in his cheek as he strained around the thick length beautiful in a twisted sort of way. </i></p><p><i>Steve wasn\u2019t all the way in when the head met the back of Bucky\u2019s tongue, but the brunette took a deep breath in through his nose and let his jaw fall open even more until Steve was buried in his throat. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFuck, look at the way you take me.\u201d Steve groaned, cupping Bucky\u2019s jaw with his hand, his fingers pressing experimentally when he could feel his own bulk straining in Bucky\u2019s throat. \u201cThis is where you\u2019re supposed to be yeah, on your knees like this?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bucky couldn\u2019t move enough to even nod, but his eyes opened wide in acknowledgement and then fell closed, the muscles of his throat squeezing as he tried to swallow, a mumbled, muffled moan when he could taste the first pulse of liquid from the tip of Steve\u2019s cock. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTaste good?\u201d Steve wanted to know, withdrawing enough so Bucky could nod, smiling knowingly when Bucky chased it with a whine, sucking and slurping over the drooling slit to catch as much as he could. \u201cYeah that\u2019s right, don\u2019t waste a single drop.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWant you to fuck me.\u201d Bucky spoke between licking long stripes up the sensitive skin, suckling over the head and smearing the precome over his lips. \u201cFuck my throat. I\u2019ll swallow all of it, I promise.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right you will.\u201d Steve\u2019s blue eyes looked almost black in the early morning light, his gaze nothing less than possessive as he wove thick fingers into Bucky\u2019s long hair. \u201cHow long can you hold your breath?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cLong enough to make you come.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d Bucky decided in an instant and Steve jumped to his feet, already grabbing for him. \u201cCome on.

It\u2019s not the end yet.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThe end of the line.\u201d Bucky repeated, and he took one step forward, then another, then he was running for Steve, stumbling over his feet and reaching out desperately until Steve caught him, wrapped his arms around Bucky\u2019s shoulders and held him tight. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d Steve finally let himself cry, tears falling into Bucky\u2019s hair. \u201cI thought I lost you, thought I\u2019d never see you again\u2013\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou found me.\u201d Bucky pulled away just enough to stare into Steve\u2019s eyes. \u201cStevie you found me.\u201d </i></p><p><i>There was a moment of hesitation, a second where they both didn\u2019t know what to do but both knew what they wanted to do\u2013</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m never letting you go again.\u201d Steve crushed their mouths together and lost himself in the kiss, let Bucky\u2019s weight take him to the floor, spread his legs and dragged his fingers through all that hair and kissed his long lost love until he couldn\u2019t even breathe through it. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m never letting you go again.\u201d Fiercer this time, and when Bucky started pulling at his clothes Steve just let them tear, the pieces falling to the ground around them.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Never mind that they were in the middle of a bombed out, abandoned building. Never mind the dirty floor and the cold air.

You finally finished that fic?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve felt foolish for crying over a story, but he couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cY\u2019know there\u2019s a million different fics on here about the moment I found you again? And none of them are exactly right, I mean we definitely didn\u2019t get naked on some gross floor in an abandoned warehouse\u2013\u201d\u00a0Bucky laughed quietly and held him a little tighter. \u201cBut they are all sort of true anyway. Finding you again was\u2013\u201d he shook his head. \u201cBucky, I\u2019ll never get over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell good.\u201d Bucky kissed his head. \u201cI\u2019m not ever gonna get over it either. Love you, Stevie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you too, Buck.\u201d The tablet landed on the end table and Steve turned fully into Bucky\u2019s arms. \u201c<i>Christ</i>, I love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI gotta say, it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve moved away from the smuttier fics to read something sweet.\u201d Bucky muffled a laugh into Steve\u2019s hair. \u201cI was starting to get a little freaked out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe don\u2019t go snooping through my recently reads and you won\u2019t be freaked out.\u201d Steve muttered and Bucky pinched him. \u201cSorry. S\u2019just sorta sexy to read about stuff we\u2019ve never tried.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wanna try some of it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to try a few things.\u201d Steve admitted. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t alright with being tied up but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m not okay with that?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013I figured because of HYDRA\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cSexy tied up times with you is real different than strapped to a chair for HYDRA.\u201d Bucky interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019ll hafta you know\u2026 negotiate?

But we can try something new Stevie, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood god, I <i>do </i>love you.\u201d </p><p>********************</p><p>********************</p><p>Tony smiled up at Steve and Bucky when they filed into the living room for movie night, and he smiled bigger when they switched directions and fell onto the couch next to him, one super soldier on either side. </p><p>\u201cBucky baby, how is the tablet treating you?\u201d he asked politely, jumping when Bucky\u2019s knee landed against his own, but not moving away. \u201cThrown it into any showers lately?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been being real careful with it.\u201d Bucky promised, and dropped one eye in an entirely too charming wink. \u201cBut I might throw it into a shower if I knew it would get <i>you </i>into the water, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Steve interrupted smoothly. \u201cImagine running into you here. Must be my lucky day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the movie room?\u201d Tony gestured around in confusion. \u201cAlright?\u201d </p><p>Next to him, Bucky yawned loudly and stretched his arm out over the top of the couch. \u201cThis couch is so small we\u2019re going to have to cuddle just to make it work.\u201d he joked. \u201cGuess that\u2019s why they call it a love seat, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other reasons they call it a <i>love seat</i>.\u201d Steve disagreed playfully.\u00a0 \u201cRight Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm\u2013?\u201d he sent them both uncertain looks. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some popcorn. When I get back, maybe you two stop being so weird, huh?\u201d Tony raised his voice to the rest of the room\u2013 \u201cAnyone else want popcorn?\u201d and headed towards the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cHey <i>look </i>it\u2019s Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb-ass.\u201d Sam popped up from behind the couch, and it was only Steve grabbing Bucky\u2019s hand that saved him from being backhanded by a very startled super soldier. \u201cCan I offer you two a suggestion or two? Or eight, because good Lord do you two need some help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNext time you scare me like that I\u2019m gonna hurt you.\u201d Bucky grumbled and Sam clucked at him in disapproval. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon now, that isn\u2019t anyway to treat the man who\u2019s going to make sure you don\u2019t embarrass yourself in front of Tony anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do mean embarrass ourselves?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cAnd which one am I? Tweedle Dee or the other one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask, you already know.\u201d Sam snarked. \u201cNow listen. Just some friendly advice? Stop talking to Tony like you guys are quoting lines from some terrible porno and maybe he wouldn\u2019t run to the kitchen to escape the ball of awkward you\u2019ve turned the conversation into.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t talking like we were in a porno!\u201d Bucky protested, but Sam only made a \u2018uh huh, sure\u2019 sort of noise and clapped them on the shoulders, disappearing to find his own seat. \u201cWe weren\u2019t we talking like we were in a porno, were we Stevie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cEven though, I guess the whole shower line was a little weird?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell what about your whole \u2018imagine seeing you here\u2019 line? We live in the same building!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t half as bad as your \u2018guess we will have to cuddle\u2019!\u201d Steve defended. \u201cWhy would you even say something like that?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno, it worked in a story I\u2013\u201d Bucky\u2019s mouth fell open, a horrified expression on his face. \u201cOh dear god, are we quoting fan fiction when we talk to Tony now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo we aren\u2019t\u2013\u201d Steve stopped, thought about it for a minute. \u201cYep. Yep we are.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, that has to stop.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Definitely </i>has to stop.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe we should take a break from all our reading.\u201d Bucky suggested. \u201cI read for a solid four hours yesterday and when we ordered pizza? I fully expected the delivery guy to make a comment about taking something <i>else </i>for a tip.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>WHAT</i>?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was some au where you were a starving theater kid who delivered pizza for extra money and I was your sugar daddy.\u201d Bucky waved him off. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019s sorta starting to affect real life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe we could just scale it down to right before bed?\u201d Steve said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to read about ourselves, you know? We fall in love in every single one of these universes and I dunno, I think it makes me love you a little more.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt makes me love you more too.\u201d Bucky leaned over and captured his mouth in a sweet, slow kiss. \u201cBut when we start using weird come on\u2019s with Tony and fucking <i>Sam </i>notices? Something\u2019s gotta give.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Steve sounded reluctant. \u201cOnly before bed, no more weird lines with Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hey real quick\u2013\u201d Bucky lowered his voice when Tony came back with a bowl of popcorn. \u201cHave you come across anything called ABO yet? It came up in a tag and I don\u2019t know what it is. Seems intense.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find some tonight.\u201d Steve said quickly, and scooted back over to make room for Tony between them. \u201cWe\u2019ve read some pretty weird stuff, ABO can\u2019t be much weirder, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight, we can handle it.\u201d </p><p>*********************</p><p>*********************</p><p>Both tablets and phones sat unused for a full day and a half after Steve and Bucky searched through the ABO tag. </p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t handle that.\u201d Steve admitted at the end of day two. </p><p>\u201cSo many words ruined for me.\u201d Bucky said mournfully. \u201cAlpha, beta, omega. Knot. Heat.\u00a0<i>Slick</i>. I can\u2019t even have a conversation anymore without feelin\u2019 like I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about something weird! Clint said the floor was slick the other day and I almost died!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought the knot part of it was okay.\u201d Steve said hesitantly. \u201cSeems sorta fun.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe fun for someone who <i>tops</i>!\u201d Bucky shouted, waving his hands about wildly. \u201cI\u2019m the asshole that has to take the damn thing! Fuck off outta here with that knot business!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are they yelling about?\u201d Natasha asked as she and Clint passed outside the bedroom door. \u201cTying <i>knots</i>?\u201d </p><p>Clint just rolled his eyes. \u201cWho the hell knows?

We gotta share a bed and you are all fucked up coz we snuggled a little the night before and you got some morning wood. Just as awkward as can be. I\u2019m noticing a recurring theme in these \u2018one bed\u2019 fics? You got some real issues fessin\u2019 up to wanting to get nekkid with me. Apparently I\u2019m down to do the dirty with you, but you wanna hold onto that All American heterosexuality.\u201d </p><p>He waggled his eyebrows at his boyfriend. \u201cI never knew you were so self-oppressed, Stevie. Was it hard for you to get into bed with me? Had to close your eyes and think of America to get through it all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know damn well I\u2019ve never been All American hetero.\u201d Steve kicked him back, then stretched out on the couch, wiggling his toes until Bucky\u2019s left hand landed at his heel, the cool metal fingers already moving in an easy foot rub. \u201cPretty sure the first time we were naked together it was cos I was ripping your clothes off anyway.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe first time we got naked together you were almost dying.\u201d Bucky corrected. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t nothing fun about it. No ripping of clothes, no morning wood, no gratuitous humpin\u2019, nothing. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Steve\u2019s smile was a little sad. \u201cThe year I got pneumonia and the heat went out in the building. We burned th\u2019 chairs remember? Burned them in the stove for a little bit of heat. We had to share the blankets, sleep almost naked to keep me warm, you had to hold me down so I wouldn\u2019t shiver.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood times. Don\u2019t miss it at all.\u201d Bucky ran his thumb firmly over the arch in Steve\u2019s foot. \u201cThink we shared a bed every night after that, though huh? Weren\u2019t no reason to go back to sleeping separately once we\u2019d started sleeping together?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure wasn\u2019t.\u201d The look they shared was soft and sweet and full of a million memories. \u201cTook us a while to get back to same bed this time around, but we made it again, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah Stevie, we made it. Right back where we belong.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo what happens in the fic then?\u201d Steve said after a moment, motioning to Bucky\u2019s phone. \u201cDo we end up sharing a bed? End up getting naked together? What happens?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that sort of ending is a given with this trope.\u201d Raised eyebrows as Bucky scrolled a little further through the fic. \u201cWell would you look at <i>that</i>. For bein\u2019 so shy about poking me with your morning rise and shine, you sure enjoy it later on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Steve perked up a little, putting down his crossword puzzle and sitting up. \u201cDo I top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right, because <i>you\u2019re</i> going to top in a fic where I gotta talk you through a big gay crisis before we can share a bed. What are you thinking?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, let me read it.\u201d Steve snatched for the phone, more interested than he wanted to admit over a sexy scene where Bucky topped.\u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t <i>thought </i>about it, after all. Bucky was gorgeous and Steve would let him do anything he wanted in bed. Bucky had never asked to top, so Steve had never offered but maybe if he read some fic and got some ideas\u2026.</p><p>\u201cLet me read it!\u201d he said in exasperation when Bucky frowned at him. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got to read a bottom <i>me </i>fic at some point, right? I\u2019d rather it be this one than that subby one you were reading where I was wearing a collar.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, but I didn\u2019t actually read that one, I got weirded out when you called me <i>Sir </i>and I called you <i>puppy</i>.\u201d Bucky crowded his phone to his chest so Steve couldn\u2019t see the screen. \u201cHonestly, thank God for a back button. And besides, you don\u2019t get to make fun of me for reading this stuff and then ask questions about it! That\u2019s not how it works!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it!\u201d Steve twisted around and lunged onto Bucky, grappling at the phone until they both fell off the couch and onto the floor. \u201cLet me see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your own fic!\u201d Bucky hollered, holding the phone above his head and wrapping his legs around Steve\u2019s waist, squeezing tight so the blonde couldn\u2019t get any closer. \u201cYou have a phone! Read your own shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit Bucky!\u201d Steve planted his hands on the floor and rolled a few times, breaking Bucky\u2019s hold around his waist and scrambling up his boyfriends body to get to the phone. \u201cI just want to see it! Just let me\u2014!\u201d </p><p>They both froze when the living room door swished open and Tony stepped through, the dark eyed genius sending them an amused smile as he took in their more-than-slightly compromising position, Bucky with his legs spread and Steve for all intents and purposes rather roughly pinning him to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole gym downstairs if you boys wanted to wrestle.\u201d Tony said good naturedly. \u201cOr you know, a bedroom upstairs if you wanted to <i>wrassle</i>.\u201d he exaggerated the last word, wiggling his eyebrows in their direction.</p><p>\u201cUh, this isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d Steve said lamely, gesturing between their bodies. \u201cHonest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest.\u201d Bucky repeated, outright chucking his phone across the room so Tony wouldn\u2019t catch a glimpse of what was in the screen. \u201cAlso\u2014\u201c he flinched when it shattered on the wall. \u201c\u2014Also I might need a new phone.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d Tony glanced at the pieces of the now ruined phone. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, I needed a new project and designing tech that super soldiers can\u2019t shatter could be a fun one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d Steve scrambled to his feet, hauling Bucky up with him. \u201cAnyway um\u2014 how are you? How\u2019s your day going?\u201d His smile was a bit goofy, and so was Bucky\u2019s, the latter shoving his hands in his pocket and flushing a soft pink. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Tony was trying not to laugh at them, but for two serum jacked super soldiers good <i>god </i>were they dorky. \u201cI was going to deliver this for Bucky.\u201d He held up a new tablet. \u201cBut after seeing what just happened with the phone, maybe I\u2019ll take it back and reinforce it a few dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, listen.\u201d Bucky elbowed Steve lightly and the blonde gave him a quick nod of encouragement. \u201cWe um\u2014 we had a <i>really </i>great time with you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Steve agreed. \u201cA really great time, Tony. Dinner was awesome, the restaurant was super cool and you know\u2013 we should do it again sometime. <i>Soon</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Tony looked up from whatever he was doing on Bucky\u2019s tablet to give them a bright smile. \u201cAnytime guys, let me know. I\u2019ll bring Sam or something, we can make a whole night of it. Could be really fun.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh not <i>Sam</i>.\u201d Bucky muttered and when Tony\u2019s brow wrinkled he hastened to add, \u201cNot that we don\u2019t love Sam. Boy howdy, do we love Sam. Seriously. Love that guy to death.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBoy howdy?\u201d Steve whispered and Bucky shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWhat he means is, maybe just the three of us could do something.\u201d Steve clarified. \u201cYou know, dinner or a movie or something like that. Or you could just come along on one of our regular date nights? Whatever you want. It could be really really fun, Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne of your regular date nights.\u201d What had looked like a spark of interest in Tony\u2019s eyes faded away to resignation. \u201cYeah. Sure. That sounds like it might be fun, sure. I\u2019ll go make a few adjustments to this tablet Buck, and then I\u2019ll give it right back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026sure.\u201d Bucky said slowly, and after Tony turned and left rather abruptly, he asked, \u201cUh, what did we just do wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d Steve frowned at the door Tony had gone through. \u201cI mean, we told him we had a good time, we invited him along for any and all date nights. I dunno what we did wrong. Maybe he\u2019s just not interested? I feel like that was a pretty strong hint.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be interested in us?\u201d Bucky sounded entirely offended. \u201cWe\u2019re a catch, right? Two super soldiers? Besides he had a lot of fun last night! He was all flirty and cute and I swear he wanted you to kiss him goodnight, Stevie. No one puts on chapstick right before saying goodnight unless they want a kiss.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI kinda thought he wanted a kiss too, but then he ducked into his room.\u201d Steve thought for a few seconds. \u201cAnd we <i>are </i>a catch, but I gotta say, you destroying your phone in front of him probably didn\u2019t earn us any brownie points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not my smoothest moment.\u201d Bucky agreed sheepishly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want him to see me reading sexy things. That feels like something I\u2019ll admit after we\u2019ve been dating a while or something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell unless we get a whole lot more obvious, we won\u2019t ever <i>be </i>dating Tony.\u201d Steve blew out a breath, then sent Bucky a side-ways look. \u201cThat fic was sexy enough that you woulda been embarrassed for Tony to read it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sorta was.\u201d</p><p>Steve dug his own phone out of his pocket and handed it to Bucky. \u201cCan you find it again?\u201d</p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>\u201cOne coffee, just the way you like it.\u201d Steve placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of Bucky, running his hand purposefully over the front of Bucky\u2019s trousers before purring in his ear, \u201cWith lots of extra <i>cream</i>.\u201d </p><p>The words were quiet, but apparently not quiet enough, because across the table Clint spit his coffee out all over himself and all over Natasha, who had been perched on his lap nibbling at her breakfast. </p><p>\u201c<i>Clint</i>!\u201d she screeched, and Clint started grabbing at napkins, mopping drops from her face and hair as fast as he could.\u00a0\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart.\u201d he apologized over and over. \u201cI thought Cap said something super awkward and dear god I hope I misheard him\u2013\u201d he shot Steve a look just shy of horrified. \u201c\u2013and it startled me. Sorry, so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Tasha cursed again, hopping off his lap. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really want to wear this shirt anyway. Come on love, help me pick out another one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, babe.\u201d Clint tossed the napkins on the table and followed her from the room, glaring at Steve and Bucky as he went. </p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d Bucky scolded, and Steve ducked his head to mutter, \u201cI am fucking ashamed of myself.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean did you really tell me you had my coffee with extra cream?\u201d He stared down at his cup suspiciously. \u201cPlease tell me you meant real cream. You meant <i>real </i>cream right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I meant real cream.\u201d Steve said grumpily. \u201cI just thought it would be funny. Didn\u2019t mean for Clint to hear. All the mornings for him to actually have his hearing aids in? Usually he doesn\u2019t bother wearing them until nine am!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIn what universe is saying cream while whispering and touching me like that funny?\u201d Bucky retorted. \u201cThat sounds like something out of a\u2013\u201d his expression cleared. \u201cYou discovered coffee shop au\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many of them!\u201d Steve took a drink of Bucky\u2019s coffee and dropped into the chair next to him. \u201cWho knew there were so many ways to fall in love with a barista!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, but we must be reading different coffee shop fics because I have yet to come across one where <i>cream </i>didn\u2019t mean <i>cream</i>.\u201d Bucky narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat rating are you reading?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was a\u2026\u201d Steve coughed, shifted in his seat and coughed again. Folded his arms, unfolded them to scratch at his chin, crossed his legs and drummed his fingers on his knee. \u201cIt was a slightly kinky one. Probably.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSlightly kinky.\u201d Bucky opened his phone to the now-bookmarked AO3 page and scrolled through his current page of coffee shop au\u2019s. \u201cOkay, none of these look kinky, Steve. What the hell are you\u2013\u201d </p><p>His voice trailed off when he found a rather incriminating story and Steve blushed a <i>very </i>incriminating shade of red. </p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Bucky said bluntly. \u201cFor the love of fuck. Are you serious?\u201d </p><p>Steve buried his face in his hands, hiding away from the judgement in Bucky\u2019s eyes as he scrolled through the fic, reading out loud in a barely there whisper, something no one but Steve would overhear. </p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDo you take cream in your coffee?\u201d Steve asked from the kitchen, and Bucky managed a negative sound over the gag in his mouth. \u201cNo? I feel like I don\u2019t remember you drinking it black last time.\u201d \u00a0</i></p><p><i>Steve put his own cup down on the end table and crossed to where Bucky was still kneeling on the pillow, head tipped back so all that beautiful hair spilled down his shoulders, blue grey eyes half closed, hands tied behind his back. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful like this.\u201d Steve murmured, and a shudder went through Bucky\u2019s body. \u201cWho knew I\u2019d find someone like you just because the barista got our coffee orders mixed up?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Gentle fingers eased the gag from Bucky\u2019s mouth, and Steve ran his thumb over the soft pink lips. \u201cDo you need a drink?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cActually.\u201d Bucky\u2019s tongue flicked out over Steve\u2019s thumb. \u201cActually I was thinking I would take some cream. I changed my mind. Is that alright?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Steve started to frown, but it fell into a gasp when Bucky leaned forward just enough to mouth over his still clothed cock, soaking the front of his shorts with spit and moaning loudly enough that Steve could feel the vibrations in his core. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNaughty boy.\u201d he breathed and Bucky went back on his heels, mouth falling open lewdly, his own cock starting to twitch and fill where it lay against his bare thigh. </i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease, Stevie.\u201d Bucky whined, high and anxious, peering up at Steve from beneath thick eyelashes. \u201cPlease can I have some cream with my coffee?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOpen up.\u201d Steve pushed his briefs down his legs, guided the tip of his heavy cock to rest on Bucky\u2019s tongue. \u201cYou know how I like it.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d Bucky tossed the phone away and snorted a laugh. \u201cStevie, the fuck? Do you really\u2013?\u201d his eyes widened when he saw how uncomfortable Steve was, chewing at his lip, eyes bright with longing and maybe a little nervousness. </p><p>\u201cStevie?\u201d Bucky asked again and Steve made a soft sort of eager noise, his legs falling open so Bucky could see the outline of his cock straining against the denim. </p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d he said slowly, and picked the phone back up.</p><blockquote><p><i>The noise Bucky made as inch after inch of Steve filled his mouth was obscene, the bulge in his cheek as he strained around the thick length beautiful in a twisted sort of way. </i></p><p><i>Steve wasn\u2019t all the way in when the head met the back of Bucky\u2019s tongue, but the brunette took a deep breath in through his nose and let his jaw fall open even more until Steve was buried in his throat. </i></p><p><i>\u201cFuck, look at the way you take me.\u201d Steve groaned, cupping Bucky\u2019s jaw with his hand, his fingers pressing experimentally when he could feel his own bulk straining in Bucky\u2019s throat. \u201cThis is where you\u2019re supposed to be yeah, on your knees like this?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Bucky couldn\u2019t move enough to even nod, but his eyes opened wide in acknowledgement and then fell closed, the muscles of his throat squeezing as he tried to swallow, a mumbled, muffled moan when he could taste the first pulse of liquid from the tip of Steve\u2019s cock. </i></p><p><i>\u201cTaste good?\u201d Steve wanted to know, withdrawing enough so Bucky could nod, smiling knowingly when Bucky chased it with a whine, sucking and slurping over the drooling slit to catch as much as he could. \u201cYeah that\u2019s right, don\u2019t waste a single drop.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cWant you to fuck me.\u201d Bucky spoke between licking long stripes up the sensitive skin, suckling over the head and smearing the precome over his lips. \u201cFuck my throat. I\u2019ll swallow all of it, I promise.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right you will.\u201d Steve\u2019s blue eyes looked almost black in the early morning light, his gaze nothing less than possessive as he wove thick fingers into Bucky\u2019s long hair. \u201cHow long can you hold your breath?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cLong enough to make you come.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d Bucky decided in an instant and Steve jumped to his feet, already grabbing for him. \u201cCome on. Maybe I do want some cream with my coffee.\u201d </p><p>***************</p><p>***************</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cBucky?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Steve.\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice was raw and hoarse, deeper than Steve remembered, empty of that swaggering Brooklyn drawl, but still so familiar that Steve could have cried right then and there.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBeen lookin\u2019 for you, Buck.\u201d he managed, hands clenching at his sides because he didn\u2019t know if he could reach out and touch yet. \u201cBeen lookin\u2019 for you for a long time.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou found me?\u201d It was a question, heartbreaking in it\u2019s simplicity, Bucky still not sure that it was real. \u201cStevie you found me.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI told you.\u201d Steve took a step closer, a tremble starting somewhere in his core and spreading to his fingers. \u201cI told you, till the end of the line Buck.

Love you, Stevie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI love you too, Buck.\u201d The tablet landed on the end table and Steve turned fully into Bucky\u2019s arms. \u201c<i>Christ</i>, I love you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI gotta say, it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve moved away from the smuttier fics to read something sweet.\u201d Bucky muffled a laugh into Steve\u2019s hair. \u201cI was starting to get a little freaked out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe don\u2019t go snooping through my recently reads and you won\u2019t be freaked out.\u201d Steve muttered and Bucky pinched him. \u201cSorry. S\u2019just sorta sexy to read about stuff we\u2019ve never tried.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wanna try some of it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to try a few things.\u201d Steve admitted. \u201cI know you aren\u2019t alright with being tied up but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m not okay with that?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013I figured because of HYDRA\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cSexy tied up times with you is real different than strapped to a chair for HYDRA.\u201d Bucky interrupted. \u201cWe\u2019ll hafta you know\u2026 negotiate? Safe words and all that sorta thing. But we can try something new Stevie, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood god, I <i>do </i>love you.\u201d </p><p>********************</p><p>********************</p><p>Tony smiled up at Steve and Bucky when they filed into the living room for movie night, and he smiled bigger when they switched directions and fell onto the couch next to him, one super soldier on either side. </p><p>\u201cBucky baby, how is the tablet treating you?\u201d he asked politely, jumping when Bucky\u2019s knee landed against his own, but not moving away. \u201cThrown it into any showers lately?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been being real careful with it.\u201d Bucky promised, and dropped one eye in an entirely too charming wink. \u201cBut I might throw it into a shower if I knew it would get <i>you </i>into the water, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d Steve interrupted smoothly. \u201cImagine running into you here. Must be my lucky day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the movie room?\u201d Tony gestured around in confusion. \u201cAlright?\u201d </p><p>Next to him, Bucky yawned loudly and stretched his arm out over the top of the couch. \u201cThis couch is so small we\u2019re going to have to cuddle just to make it work.\u201d he joked. \u201cGuess that\u2019s why they call it a love seat, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other reasons they call it a <i>love seat</i>.\u201d Steve disagreed playfully.\u00a0 \u201cRight Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm\u2013?\u201d he sent them both uncertain looks. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some popcorn. When I get back, maybe you two stop being so weird, huh?\u201d Tony raised his voice to the rest of the room\u2013 \u201cAnyone else want popcorn?\u201d and headed towards the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cHey <i>look </i>it\u2019s Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb-ass.\u201d Sam popped up from behind the couch, and it was only Steve grabbing Bucky\u2019s hand that saved him from being backhanded by a very startled super soldier. \u201cCan I offer you two a suggestion or two? Or eight, because good Lord do you two need some help.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNext time you scare me like that I\u2019m gonna hurt you.\u201d Bucky grumbled and Sam clucked at him in disapproval. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon now, that isn\u2019t anyway to treat the man who\u2019s going to make sure you don\u2019t embarrass yourself in front of Tony anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do mean embarrass ourselves?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cAnd which one am I? Tweedle Dee or the other one?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask, you already know.\u201d Sam snarked. \u201cNow listen. Just some friendly advice? Stop talking to Tony like you guys are quoting lines from some terrible porno and maybe he wouldn\u2019t run to the kitchen to escape the ball of awkward you\u2019ve turned the conversation into.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t talking like we were in a porno!\u201d Bucky protested, but Sam only made a \u2018uh huh, sure\u2019 sort of noise and clapped them on the shoulders, disappearing to find his own seat. \u201cWe weren\u2019t we talking like we were in a porno, were we Stevie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cEven though, I guess the whole shower line was a little weird?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell what about your whole \u2018imagine seeing you here\u2019 line? We live in the same building!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t half as bad as your \u2018guess we will have to cuddle\u2019!\u201d Steve defended. \u201cWhy would you even say something like that?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno, it worked in a story I\u2013\u201d Bucky\u2019s mouth fell open, a horrified expression on his face. \u201cOh dear god, are we quoting fan fiction when we talk to Tony now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo we aren\u2019t\u2013\u201d Steve stopped, thought about it for a minute. \u201cYep. Yep we are.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, that has to stop.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Definitely </i>has to stop.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe we should take a break from all our reading.\u201d Bucky suggested. \u201cI read for a solid four hours yesterday and when we ordered pizza? I fully expected the delivery guy to make a comment about taking something <i>else </i>for a tip.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>WHAT</i>?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was some au where you were a starving theater kid who delivered pizza for extra money and I was your sugar daddy.\u201d Bucky waved him off. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019s sorta starting to affect real life.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMaybe we could just scale it down to right before bed?\u201d Steve said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to read about ourselves, you know? We fall in love in every single one of these universes and I dunno, I think it makes me love you a little more.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt makes me love you more too.\u201d Bucky leaned over and captured his mouth in a sweet, slow kiss. \u201cBut when we start using weird come on\u2019s with Tony and fucking <i>Sam </i>notices? Something\u2019s gotta give.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, fine.\u201d Steve sounded reluctant. \u201cOnly before bed, no more weird lines with Tony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hey real quick\u2013\u201d Bucky lowered his voice when Tony came back with a bowl of popcorn. \u201cHave you come across anything called ABO yet? It came up in a tag and I don\u2019t know what it is. Seems intense.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find some tonight.\u201d Steve said quickly, and scooted back over to make room for Tony between them. \u201cWe\u2019ve read some pretty weird stuff, ABO can\u2019t be much weirder, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRight, we can handle it.\u201d </p><p>*********************</p><p>*********************</p><p>Both tablets and phones sat unused for a full day and a half after Steve and Bucky searched through the ABO tag. </p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t handle that.\u201d Steve admitted at the end of day two. </p><p>\u201cSo many words ruined for me.\u201d Bucky said mournfully. \u201cAlpha, beta, omega. Knot. Heat.\u00a0<i>Slick</i>. I can\u2019t even have a conversation anymore without feelin\u2019 like I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about something weird! Clint said the floor was slick the other day and I almost died!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought the knot part of it was okay.\u201d Steve said hesitantly. \u201cSeems sorta fun.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe fun for someone who <i>tops</i>!\u201d Bucky shouted, waving his hands about wildly. \u201cI\u2019m the asshole that has to take the damn thing! Fuck off outta here with that knot business!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat are they yelling about?\u201d Natasha asked as she and Clint passed outside the bedroom door. \u201cTying <i>knots</i>?\u201d </p><p>Clint just rolled his eyes. \u201cWho the hell knows?

We&rsquo;ve been sleeping on th&rsquo; fuckin&rsquo; ground getting eaten alive by all sortsa bugs for six days. It&rsquo;s a room, it&rsquo;s a bed&mdash;&ldquo; Bucky tore the cap off a warm beer and took a long drink, grimacing at the taste. &ldquo;&mdash; so I&rsquo;m gonna pound this piss poor excuse for beer and pass out against that shitty lookin&rsquo; pillow. You&rsquo;re more than welcome to sleep on the floor if you&rsquo;re gonna be weird about it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying it seems a little&hellip;&rdquo; Steve cleared his throat again. &ldquo;&hellip; I mean, after what happened I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be around me? Feels like things are maybe a little&ndash;&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We has to snuggle for warmth.&rdquo; Bucky interrupted. &ldquo;It was raining, it was fuckin&rsquo; freezing, we needed body warmth, it is what it is. We got all cuddled up, you got a little morning wood, ended up humping me a little, it happens. We&rsquo;re guys. Stop being stupid about it.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;BUCKY!&rdquo; Steve turned bright red. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I mean to do&ndash; to do that!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Stevie.&rdquo; A look Steve had never seen before flickered through Bucky&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t like I pushed you away, you know?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I guess you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Steve said awkwardly, remembering in vivid detail how Bucky had grabbed at him for just a few seconds, how the metal fingers had felt digging into his thigh and pulling him into Bucky&rsquo;s body again. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re right. No reason for things to be weird, we&rsquo;ll share a bed and I&rsquo;ll try not to uh&ndash; to rub against you tonight.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Bucky didn&rsquo;t say anything to that, but his gaze dropped over Steve&rsquo;s body, lingering below his waist until Steve started shifting nervously. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well then.&rdquo; Bucky finally said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a shower, I&rsquo;ll save you some water.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Steve dropped onto the bed, and then jumped right back up, somehow turning an even brighter shade of red, mortified over the direction his thoughts had suddenly gone, the thought of sharing a real bed with Bucky enough to make him&ndash;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You got a real stupid look on your face right now, Stevie.&rdquo; Bucky cracked a grin. &ldquo;Stop over thinkin&rsquo; it, huh?&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Bucky whistled out loud, kicking at Steve&rsquo;s leg. &ldquo;Babe, you are a whiny <i>bitch </i>in this one. We gotta share a bed and you are all fucked up coz we snuggled a little the night before and you got some morning wood. Just as awkward as can be. I&rsquo;m noticing a recurring theme in these &lsquo;one bed&rsquo; fics? You got some real issues fessin&rsquo; up to wanting to get nekkid with me. Apparently I&rsquo;m down to do the dirty with you, but you wanna hold onto that All American heterosexuality.&rdquo; </p><p>He waggled his eyebrows at his boyfriend. &ldquo;I never knew you were so self-oppressed, Stevie. Was it hard for you to get into bed with me? Had to close your eyes and think of America to get through it all?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know damn well I&rsquo;ve never been All American hetero.&rdquo; Steve kicked him back, then stretched out on the couch, wiggling his toes until Bucky&rsquo;s left hand landed at his heel, the cool metal fingers already moving in an easy foot rub. &ldquo;Pretty sure the first time we were naked together it was cos I was ripping your clothes off anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The first time we got naked together you were almost dying.&rdquo; Bucky corrected. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t nothing fun about it. No ripping of clothes, no morning wood, no gratuitous humpin&rsquo;, nothing. Remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s smile was a little sad. &ldquo;The year I got pneumonia and the heat went out in the building. We burned th&rsquo; chairs remember? Burned them in the stove for a little bit of heat. We had to share the blankets, sleep almost naked to keep me warm, you had to hold me down so I wouldn&rsquo;t shiver.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Good times. Don&rsquo;t miss it at all.&rdquo; Bucky ran his thumb firmly over the arch in Steve&rsquo;s foot. &ldquo;Think we shared a bed every night after that, though huh? Weren&rsquo;t no reason to go back to sleeping separately once we&rsquo;d started sleeping together?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The look they shared was soft and sweet and full of a million memories. &ldquo;Took us a while to get back to same bed this time around, but we made it again, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Stevie, we made it. Right back where we belong.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So what happens in the fic then?&rdquo; Steve said after a moment, motioning to Bucky&rsquo;s phone. &ldquo;Do we end up sharing a bed? End up getting naked together? What happens?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that sort of ending is a given with this trope.&rdquo; Raised eyebrows as Bucky scrolled a little further through the fic. &ldquo;Well would you look at <i>that</i>. For bein&rsquo; so shy about poking me with your morning rise and shine, you sure enjoy it later on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; Steve perked up a little, putting down his crossword puzzle and sitting up. &ldquo;Do I top?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah right, because <i>you&rsquo;re</i> going to top in a fic where I gotta talk you through a big gay crisis before we can share a bed. What are you thinking?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, let me read it.&rdquo; Steve snatched for the phone, more interested than he wanted to admit over a sexy scene where Bucky topped.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t like he hadn&rsquo;t <i>thought </i>about it, after all. Bucky was gorgeous and Steve would let him do anything he wanted in bed. Bucky had never asked to top, so Steve had never offered but maybe if he read some fic and got some ideas&hellip;.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me read it!&rdquo; he said in exasperation when Bucky frowned at him. &ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ve got to read a bottom <i>me </i>fic at some point, right? I&rsquo;d rather it be this one than that subby one you were reading where I was wearing a collar.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but I didn&rsquo;t actually read that one, I got weirded out when you called me <i>Sir </i>and I called you <i>puppy</i>.&rdquo; Bucky crowded his phone to his chest so Steve couldn&rsquo;t see the screen. &ldquo;Honestly, thank God for a back button. And besides, you don&rsquo;t get to make fun of me for reading this stuff and then ask questions about it! That&rsquo;s not how it works!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bullshit and you know it!&rdquo; Steve twisted around and lunged onto Bucky, grappling at the phone until they both fell off the couch and onto the floor. &ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get your own fic!&rdquo; Bucky hollered, holding the phone above his head and wrapping his legs around Steve&rsquo;s waist, squeezing tight so the blonde couldn&rsquo;t get any closer. &ldquo;You have a phone! Read your own shit!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dammit Bucky!&rdquo; Steve planted his hands on the floor and rolled a few times, breaking Bucky&rsquo;s hold around his waist and scrambling up his boyfriends body to get to the phone. &ldquo;I just want to see it! Just let me&mdash;!&rdquo; </p><p>They both froze when the living room door swished open and Tony stepped through, the dark eyed genius sending them an amused smile as he took in their more-than-slightly compromising position, Bucky with his legs spread and Steve for all intents and purposes rather roughly pinning him to the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole gym downstairs if you boys wanted to wrestle.&rdquo; Tony said good naturedly. &ldquo;Or you know, a bedroom upstairs if you wanted to <i>wrassle</i>.&rdquo; he exaggerated the last word, wiggling his eyebrows in their direction.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, this isn&rsquo;t what it looks like.&rdquo; Steve said lamely, gesturing between their bodies. &ldquo;Honest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honest.&rdquo; Bucky repeated, outright chucking his phone across the room so Tony wouldn&rsquo;t catch a glimpse of what was in the screen. &ldquo;Also&mdash;&ldquo; he flinched when it shattered on the wall. &ldquo;&mdash;Also I might need a new phone.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say.&rdquo; Tony glanced at the pieces of the now ruined phone. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright, I needed a new project and designing tech that super soldiers can&rsquo;t shatter could be a fun one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway.&rdquo; Steve scrambled to his feet, hauling Bucky up with him. &ldquo;Anyway um&mdash; how are you? How&rsquo;s your day going?&rdquo; His smile was a bit goofy, and so was Bucky&rsquo;s, the latter shoving his hands in his pocket and flushing a soft pink. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Tony was trying not to laugh at them, but for two serum jacked super soldiers good <i>god </i>were they dorky. &ldquo;I was going to deliver this for Bucky.&rdquo; He held up a new tablet. &ldquo;But after seeing what just happened with the phone, maybe I&rsquo;ll take it back and reinforce it a few dozen times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, listen.&rdquo; Bucky elbowed Steve lightly and the blonde gave him a quick nod of encouragement. &ldquo;We um&mdash; we had a <i>really </i>great time with you last night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously.&rdquo; Steve agreed. &ldquo;A really great time, Tony. Dinner was awesome, the restaurant was super cool and you know&ndash; we should do it again sometime. <i>Soon</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo; Tony looked up from whatever he was doing on Bucky&rsquo;s tablet to give them a bright smile. &ldquo;Anytime guys, let me know. I&rsquo;ll bring Sam or something, we can make a whole night of it. Could be really fun.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh not <i>Sam</i>.&rdquo; Bucky muttered and when Tony&rsquo;s brow wrinkled he hastened to add, &ldquo;Not that we don&rsquo;t love Sam. Boy howdy, do we love Sam. Seriously. Love that guy to death.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Boy howdy?&rdquo; Steve whispered and Bucky shrugged. </p><p>&ldquo;What he means is, maybe just the three of us could do something.&rdquo; Steve clarified. &ldquo;You know, dinner or a movie or something like that. Or you could just come along on one of our regular date nights? Whatever you want. It could be really really fun, Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One of your regular date nights.&rdquo; What had looked like a spark of interest in Tony&rsquo;s eyes faded away to resignation. &ldquo;Yeah. Sure. That sounds like it might be fun, sure. I&rsquo;ll go make a few adjustments to this tablet Buck, and then I&rsquo;ll give it right back, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;sure.&rdquo; Bucky said slowly, and after Tony turned and left rather abruptly, he asked, &ldquo;Uh, what did we just do wrong?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo; Steve frowned at the door Tony had gone through. &ldquo;I mean, we told him we had a good time, we invited him along for any and all date nights. I dunno what we did wrong. Maybe he&rsquo;s just not interested? I feel like that was a pretty strong hint.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be interested in us?&rdquo; Bucky sounded entirely offended. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a catch, right? Two super soldiers? Besides he had a lot of fun last night! He was all flirty and cute and I swear he wanted you to kiss him goodnight, Stevie. No one puts on chapstick right before saying goodnight unless they want a kiss.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I kinda thought he wanted a kiss too, but then he ducked into his room.&rdquo; Steve thought for a few seconds. &ldquo;And we <i>are </i>a catch, but I gotta say, you destroying your phone in front of him probably didn&rsquo;t earn us any brownie points.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, not my smoothest moment.&rdquo; Bucky agreed sheepishly. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t want him to see me reading sexy things. That feels like something I&rsquo;ll admit after we&rsquo;ve been dating a while or something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well unless we get a whole lot more obvious, we won&rsquo;t ever <i>be </i>dating Tony.&rdquo; Steve blew out a breath, then sent Bucky a side-ways look. &ldquo;That fic was sexy enough that you woulda been embarrassed for Tony to read it, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It sorta was.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve dug his own phone out of his pocket and handed it to Bucky. &ldquo;Can you find it again?&rdquo;</p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>&ldquo;One coffee, just the way you like it.&rdquo; Steve placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of Bucky, running his hand purposefully over the front of Bucky&rsquo;s trousers before purring in his ear, &ldquo;With lots of extra <i>cream</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>The words were quiet, but apparently not quiet enough, because across the table Clint spit his coffee out all over himself and all over Natasha, who had been perched on his lap nibbling at her breakfast. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Clint</i>!&rdquo; she screeched, and Clint started grabbing at napkins, mopping drops from her face and hair as fast as he could.&nbsp;&ldquo;What the fuck!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sweetheart.&rdquo; he apologized over and over. &ldquo;I thought Cap said something super awkward and dear god I hope I misheard him&ndash;&rdquo; he shot Steve a look just shy of horrified. &ldquo;&ndash;and it startled me. Sorry, so sorry, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Tasha cursed again, hopping off his lap. &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t really want to wear this shirt anyway. Come on love, help me pick out another one.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing, babe.&rdquo; Clint tossed the napkins on the table and followed her from the room, glaring at Steve and Bucky as he went. </p><p>&ldquo;You should be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo; Bucky scolded, and Steve ducked his head to mutter, &ldquo;I am fucking ashamed of myself.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I mean did you really tell me you had my coffee with extra cream?&rdquo; He stared down at his cup suspiciously. &ldquo;Please tell me you meant real cream. You meant <i>real </i>cream right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I meant real cream.&rdquo; Steve said grumpily. &ldquo;I just thought it would be funny. Didn&rsquo;t mean for Clint to hear. All the mornings for him to actually have his hearing aids in? Usually he doesn&rsquo;t bother wearing them until nine am!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In what universe is saying cream while whispering and touching me like that funny?&rdquo; Bucky retorted. &ldquo;That sounds like something out of a&ndash;&rdquo; his expression cleared. &ldquo;You discovered coffee shop au&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are so many of them!&rdquo; Steve took a drink of Bucky&rsquo;s coffee and dropped into the chair next to him. &ldquo;Who knew there were so many ways to fall in love with a barista!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but we must be reading different coffee shop fics because I have yet to come across one where <i>cream </i>didn&rsquo;t mean <i>cream</i>.&rdquo; Bucky narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;What rating are you reading?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was a&hellip;&rdquo; Steve coughed, shifted in his seat and coughed again. Folded his arms, unfolded them to scratch at his chin, crossed his legs and drummed his fingers on his knee. &ldquo;It was a slightly kinky one. Probably.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Slightly kinky.&rdquo; Bucky opened his phone to the now-bookmarked AO3 page and scrolled through his current page of coffee shop au&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Okay, none of these look kinky, Steve. What the hell are you&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>His voice trailed off when he found a rather incriminating story and Steve blushed a <i>very </i>incriminating shade of red. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve.&rdquo; Bucky said bluntly. &ldquo;For the love of fuck. Are you serious?&rdquo; </p><p>Steve buried his face in his hands, hiding away from the judgement in Bucky&rsquo;s eyes as he scrolled through the fic, reading out loud in a barely there whisper, something no one but Steve would overhear. </p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Do you take cream in your coffee?&rdquo; Steve asked from the kitchen, and Bucky managed a negative sound over the gag in his mouth. &ldquo;No? I feel like I don&rsquo;t remember you drinking it black last time.&rdquo; &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Steve put his own cup down on the end table and crossed to where Bucky was still kneeling on the pillow, head tipped back so all that beautiful hair spilled down his shoulders, blue grey eyes half closed, hands tied behind his back. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful like this.&rdquo; Steve murmured, and a shudder went through Bucky&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Who knew I&rsquo;d find someone like you just because the barista got our coffee orders mixed up?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Gentle fingers eased the gag from Bucky&rsquo;s mouth, and Steve ran his thumb over the soft pink lips. &ldquo;Do you need a drink?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Actually.&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s tongue flicked out over Steve&rsquo;s thumb. &ldquo;Actually I was thinking I would take some cream. I changed my mind. Is that alright?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Steve started to frown, but it fell into a gasp when Bucky leaned forward just enough to mouth over his still clothed cock, soaking the front of his shorts with spit and moaning loudly enough that Steve could feel the vibrations in his core. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Naughty boy.&rdquo; he breathed and Bucky went back on his heels, mouth falling open lewdly, his own cock starting to twitch and fill where it lay against his bare thigh. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Please, Stevie.&rdquo; Bucky whined, high and anxious, peering up at Steve from beneath thick eyelashes. &ldquo;Please can I have some cream with my coffee?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Open up.&rdquo; Steve pushed his briefs down his legs, guided the tip of his heavy cock to rest on Bucky&rsquo;s tongue. &ldquo;You know how I like it.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fuck me.&rdquo; Bucky tossed the phone away and snorted a laugh. &ldquo;Stevie, the fuck? Do you really&ndash;?&rdquo; his eyes widened when he saw how uncomfortable Steve was, chewing at his lip, eyes bright with longing and maybe a little nervousness. </p><p>&ldquo;Stevie?&rdquo; Bucky asked again and Steve made a soft sort of eager noise, his legs falling open so Bucky could see the outline of his cock straining against the denim. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; he said slowly, and picked the phone back up.</p><blockquote><p><i>The noise Bucky made as inch after inch of Steve filled his mouth was obscene, the bulge in his cheek as he strained around the thick length beautiful in a twisted sort of way. </i></p><p><i>Steve wasn&rsquo;t all the way in when the head met the back of Bucky&rsquo;s tongue, but the brunette took a deep breath in through his nose and let his jaw fall open even more until Steve was buried in his throat. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck, look at the way you take me.&rdquo; Steve groaned, cupping Bucky&rsquo;s jaw with his hand, his fingers pressing experimentally when he could feel his own bulk straining in Bucky&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;This is where you&rsquo;re supposed to be yeah, on your knees like this?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Bucky couldn&rsquo;t move enough to even nod, but his eyes opened wide in acknowledgement and then fell closed, the muscles of his throat squeezing as he tried to swallow, a mumbled, muffled moan when he could taste the first pulse of liquid from the tip of Steve&rsquo;s cock. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Taste good?&rdquo; Steve wanted to know, withdrawing enough so Bucky could nod, smiling knowingly when Bucky chased it with a whine, sucking and slurping over the drooling slit to catch as much as he could. &ldquo;Yeah that&rsquo;s right, don&rsquo;t waste a single drop.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Want you to fuck me.&rdquo; Bucky spoke between licking long stripes up the sensitive skin, suckling over the head and smearing the precome over his lips. &ldquo;Fuck my throat. I&rsquo;ll swallow all of it, I promise.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re damn right you will.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s blue eyes looked almost black in the early morning light, his gaze nothing less than possessive as he wove thick fingers into Bucky&rsquo;s long hair. &ldquo;How long can you hold your breath?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Long enough to make you come.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Upstairs.&rdquo; Bucky decided in an instant and Steve jumped to his feet, already grabbing for him. &ldquo;Come on. Maybe I do want some cream with my coffee.&rdquo; </p><p>***************</p><p>***************</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Bucky?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Steve.&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice was raw and hoarse, deeper than Steve remembered, empty of that swaggering Brooklyn drawl, but still so familiar that Steve could have cried right then and there.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Been lookin&rsquo; for you, Buck.&rdquo; he managed, hands clenching at his sides because he didn&rsquo;t know if he could reach out and touch yet. &ldquo;Been lookin&rsquo; for you for a long time.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You found me?&rdquo; It was a question, heartbreaking in it&rsquo;s simplicity, Bucky still not sure that it was real. &ldquo;Stevie you found me.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I told you.&rdquo; Steve took a step closer, a tremble starting somewhere in his core and spreading to his fingers. &ldquo;I told you, till the end of the line Buck. I wasn&rsquo;t ever going to give up on you. It&rsquo;s not the end yet.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The end of the line.&rdquo; Bucky repeated, and he took one step forward, then another, then he was running for Steve, stumbling over his feet and reaching out desperately until Steve caught him, wrapped his arms around Bucky&rsquo;s shoulders and held him tight. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I thought I lost you.&rdquo; Steve finally let himself cry, tears falling into Bucky&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I thought I lost you, thought I&rsquo;d never see you again&ndash;&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You found me.&rdquo; Bucky pulled away just enough to stare into Steve&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Stevie you found me.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>There was a moment of hesitation, a second where they both didn&rsquo;t know what to do but both knew what they wanted to do&ndash;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never letting you go again.&rdquo; Steve crushed their mouths together and lost himself in the kiss, let Bucky&rsquo;s weight take him to the floor, spread his legs and dragged his fingers through all that hair and kissed his long lost love until he couldn&rsquo;t even breathe through it. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never letting you go again.&rdquo; Fiercer this time, and when Bucky started pulling at his clothes Steve just let them tear, the pieces falling to the ground around them.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Never mind that they were in the middle of a bombed out, abandoned building. Never mind the dirty floor and the cold air. He needed Bucky, needed to feel him around him and in him and needed to soak in every never forgotten inch of the man he&rsquo;d loved since before he even knew what love was.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Bucky.&rdquo; he groaned, ragged and torn and desperate and Bucky&ndash; Bucky didn&rsquo;t say anything back, didn&rsquo;t trust his voice to work, but he brought Steve close and then closer still until he could feel that steady heartbeat in his very core and then&ndash;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I never stopped loving you.&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;All those times they tried to wipe me? I never forgot you, never stopped loving you. You were always mine, Stevie.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>And in that moment, in a place neither of them were supposed to be, hidden away from the truth and reality of the world around them&ndash;</i></p><p><i>&ndash;In that moment Steve let himself crumple, let himself disintegrate, let himself breathe for the first time since Bucky fell. </i></p><p><i>And in that moment, for the first time since Bucky fell, Steve thought he might actually be alright. &nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo; Bucky sat up in bed when he heard Steve sniffling, put his arms around his love and tugged him back to the pillows. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry baby, what&rsquo;s going on? You finally finished that fic?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Steve felt foolish for crying over a story, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know there&rsquo;s a million different fics on here about the moment I found you again? And none of them are exactly right, I mean we definitely didn&rsquo;t get naked on some gross floor in an abandoned warehouse&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;Bucky laughed quietly and held him a little tighter. &ldquo;But they are all sort of true anyway. Finding you again was&ndash;&rdquo; he shook his head. &ldquo;Bucky, I&rsquo;ll never get over that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well good.&rdquo; Bucky kissed his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ever gonna get over it either. Love you, Stevie.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Buck.&rdquo; The tablet landed on the end table and Steve turned fully into Bucky&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;<i>Christ</i>, I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I gotta say, it&rsquo;s nice that you&rsquo;ve moved away from the smuttier fics to read something sweet.&rdquo; Bucky muffled a laugh into Steve&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;I was starting to get a little freaked out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe don&rsquo;t go snooping through my recently reads and you won&rsquo;t be freaked out.&rdquo; Steve muttered and Bucky pinched him. &ldquo;Sorry. S&rsquo;just sorta sexy to read about stuff we&rsquo;ve never tried.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You wanna try some of it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try a few things.&rdquo; Steve admitted. &ldquo;I know you aren&rsquo;t alright with being tied up but&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m not okay with that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;I figured because of HYDRA&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sexy tied up times with you is real different than strapped to a chair for HYDRA.&rdquo; Bucky interrupted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hafta you know&hellip; negotiate? Safe words and all that sorta thing. But we can try something new Stevie, if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good god, I <i>do </i>love you.&rdquo; </p><p>********************</p><p>********************</p><p>Tony smiled up at Steve and Bucky when they filed into the living room for movie night, and he smiled bigger when they switched directions and fell onto the couch next to him, one super soldier on either side. </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky baby, how is the tablet treating you?&rdquo; he asked politely, jumping when Bucky&rsquo;s knee landed against his own, but not moving away. &ldquo;Thrown it into any showers lately?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been being real careful with it.&rdquo; Bucky promised, and dropped one eye in an entirely too charming wink. &ldquo;But I might throw it into a shower if I knew it would get <i>you </i>into the water, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; Steve interrupted smoothly. &ldquo;Imagine running into you here. Must be my lucky day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the movie room?&rdquo; Tony gestured around in confusion. &ldquo;Alright?&rdquo; </p><p>Next to him, Bucky yawned loudly and stretched his arm out over the top of the couch. &ldquo;This couch is so small we&rsquo;re going to have to cuddle just to make it work.&rdquo; he joked. &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s why they call it a love seat, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s other reasons they call it a <i>love seat</i>.&rdquo; Steve disagreed playfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right Tony?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Um&ndash;?&rdquo; he sent them both uncertain looks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go get some popcorn. When I get back, maybe you two stop being so weird, huh?&rdquo; Tony raised his voice to the rest of the room&ndash; &ldquo;Anyone else want popcorn?&rdquo; and headed towards the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey <i>look </i>it&rsquo;s Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb-ass.&rdquo; Sam popped up from behind the couch, and it was only Steve grabbing Bucky&rsquo;s hand that saved him from being backhanded by a very startled super soldier. &ldquo;Can I offer you two a suggestion or two? Or eight, because good Lord do you two need some help.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Next time you scare me like that I&rsquo;m gonna hurt you.&rdquo; Bucky grumbled and Sam clucked at him in disapproval. </p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon now, that isn&rsquo;t anyway to treat the man who&rsquo;s going to make sure you don&rsquo;t embarrass yourself in front of Tony anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What do mean embarrass ourselves?&rdquo; Steve asked. &ldquo;And which one am I? Tweedle Dee or the other one?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If you have to ask, you already know.&rdquo; Sam snarked. &ldquo;Now listen. Just some friendly advice? Stop talking to Tony like you guys are quoting lines from some terrible porno and maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t run to the kitchen to escape the ball of awkward you&rsquo;ve turned the conversation into.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t talking like we were in a porno!&rdquo; Bucky protested, but Sam only made a &lsquo;uh huh, sure&rsquo; sort of noise and clapped them on the shoulders, disappearing to find his own seat. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t we talking like we were in a porno, were we Stevie?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nah.&rdquo; Steve shook his head. &ldquo;Even though, I guess the whole shower line was a little weird?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well what about your whole &lsquo;imagine seeing you here&rsquo; line? We live in the same building!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t half as bad as your &lsquo;guess we will have to cuddle&rsquo;!&rdquo; Steve defended. &ldquo;Why would you even say something like that?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, it worked in a story I&ndash;&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s mouth fell open, a horrified expression on his face. &ldquo;Oh dear god, are we quoting fan fiction when we talk to Tony now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No we aren&rsquo;t&ndash;&rdquo; Steve stopped, thought about it for a minute. &ldquo;Yep. Yep we are.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, that has to stop.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Definitely </i>has to stop.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we should take a break from all our reading.&rdquo; Bucky suggested. &ldquo;I read for a solid four hours yesterday and when we ordered pizza? I fully expected the delivery guy to make a comment about taking something <i>else </i>for a tip.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>WHAT</i>?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was some au where you were a starving theater kid who delivered pizza for extra money and I was your sugar daddy.&rdquo; Bucky waved him off. &ldquo;The point is, it&rsquo;s sorta starting to affect real life.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe we could just scale it down to right before bed?&rdquo; Steve said thoughtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun to read about ourselves, you know? We fall in love in every single one of these universes and I dunno, I think it makes me love you a little more.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It makes me love you more too.&rdquo; Bucky leaned over and captured his mouth in a sweet, slow kiss. &ldquo;But when we start using weird come on&rsquo;s with Tony and fucking <i>Sam </i>notices? Something&rsquo;s gotta give.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, fine.&rdquo; Steve sounded reluctant. &ldquo;Only before bed, no more weird lines with Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh hey real quick&ndash;&rdquo; Bucky lowered his voice when Tony came back with a bowl of popcorn. &ldquo;Have you come across anything called ABO yet? It came up in a tag and I don&rsquo;t know what it is. Seems intense.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find some tonight.&rdquo; Steve said quickly, and scooted back over to make room for Tony between them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve read some pretty weird stuff, ABO can&rsquo;t be much weirder, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Right, we can handle it.&rdquo; </p><p>*********************</p><p>*********************</p><p>Both tablets and phones sat unused for a full day and a half after Steve and Bucky searched through the ABO tag. </p><p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t handle that.&rdquo; Steve admitted at the end of day two. </p><p>&ldquo;So many words ruined for me.&rdquo; Bucky said mournfully. &ldquo;Alpha, beta, omega. Knot. Heat.&nbsp;<i>Slick</i>. I can&rsquo;t even have a conversation anymore without feelin&rsquo; like I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; about something weird! Clint said the floor was slick the other day and I almost died!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I thought the knot part of it was okay.&rdquo; Steve said hesitantly. &ldquo;Seems sorta fun.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, maybe fun for someone who <i>tops</i>!&rdquo; Bucky shouted, waving his hands about wildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the asshole that has to take the damn thing! Fuck off outta here with that knot business!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What are they yelling about?&rdquo; Natasha asked as she and Clint passed outside the bedroom door. &ldquo;Tying <i>knots</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>Clint just rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Who the hell knows? Super soldiers are weird.&rdquo; </p><p>************************</p>",

We&rsquo;ve been sleeping on th&rsquo; fuckin&rsquo; ground getting eaten alive by all sortsa bugs for six days. It&rsquo;s a room, it&rsquo;s a bed&mdash;&ldquo; Bucky tore the cap off a warm beer and took a long drink, grimacing at the taste. &ldquo;&mdash; so I&rsquo;m gonna pound this piss poor excuse for beer and pass out against that shitty lookin&rsquo; pillow. You&rsquo;re more than welcome to sleep on the floor if you&rsquo;re gonna be weird about it.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying it seems a little&hellip;&rdquo; Steve cleared his throat again. &ldquo;&hellip; I mean, after what happened I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be around me?

We got all cuddled up, you got a little morning wood, ended up humping me a little, it happens. We&rsquo;re guys. Stop being stupid about it.&rdquo; </i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;BUCKY!&rdquo; Steve turned bright red. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I mean to do&ndash; to do that!&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Stevie.&rdquo; A look Steve had never seen before flickered through Bucky&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t like I pushed you away, you know?&rdquo; </i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;I guess you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Steve said awkwardly, remembering in vivid detail how Bucky had grabbed at him for just a few seconds, how the metal fingers had felt digging into his thigh and pulling him into Bucky&rsquo;s body again. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re right. No reason for things to be weird, we&rsquo;ll share a bed and I&rsquo;ll try not to uh&ndash; to rub against you tonight.&rdquo; </i></p>\n<p><i>Bucky didn&rsquo;t say anything to that, but his gaze dropped over Steve&rsquo;s body, lingering below his waist until Steve started shifting nervously. </i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Well then.&rdquo; Bucky finally said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a shower, I&rsquo;ll save you some water.&rdquo; </i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Steve dropped onto the bed, and then jumped right back up, somehow turning an even brighter shade of red, mortified over the direction his thoughts had suddenly gone, the thought of sharing a real bed with Bucky enough to make him&ndash;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;You got a real stupid look on your face right now, Stevie.&rdquo; Bucky cracked a grin. &ldquo;Stop over thinkin&rsquo; it, huh?&rdquo;</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>",

Yeah, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d only been asleep for a\nmoment, as far as he could tell. Below him, the portal to another world was\nstill open in the middle of the New York street; aliens racing out with their\nstrange, glowing red weapons and armour that looked like bone. Iron Man and War\nMachine (<i>cough</i> Iron Patriot <i>cough</i>) stood back to back on the road,\nguns firing and lasers shooting out in bright beams.</p><p>It was just the three of them.\nVision had disappeared two weeks ago and was yet to return \u2013 though, secretly,\nPeter had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and the rest of the Avengers were off\u2026 Peter\ndidn\u2019t know, being war criminals? He wasn\u2019t sure. But they weren\u2019t here during\nan alien invasion.</p><p>Luckily, it was much smaller\nthan the Battle of New York one. More like a scouting party; a prelude to a\nbigger battle that would be the main event.</p><p>Peter reached the top of the\nbuilding, head aching, eyes blinking so slowly black dots were appearing across\nhis vision. God, he was fucking <i>tired.</i>\nHe hadn\u2019t been sleeping recently; just couldn\u2019t, just laid down every night and\nstared at the next bunk up until morning shone through his window. He hadn\u2019t\nbeen going out as Spiderman when he felt like this \u2013 no, Mr Stark had told him\nto look after himself, so he was trying. And, besides, if Peter used the suit\nbetween two and six AM, Tony heard about it and would be out there on the\nstreets of Queens, nagging him until he returned to bed.</p><p>So Peter was tired. Peter was\nfucking exhausted, but Peter was also in the middle of an alien invasion, so he\nhad to focus.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cLay them out for us,\u201d Tony\nsaid in his ear, and Peter nodded, eyes on the entire scene.</p><p>\u201cAbout fifty so far,\u201d Peter\nreplied after taking a long, deep breath. \u201cMost of them heading down the street\nto you \u2013 about nine or ten outliers heading the other way. Three or four are\ncoming towards my position \u2013 none seem capable of flight, so far. Oh! That one\nover there just blew a hole in a building!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, got that,\u201d Tony\nmuttered and Peter watched the Iron Man suit shoot off to where the building\nwas currently on fire.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d Peter yelled,\nfeeling as if he should be more alert but his body unwilling. Iron Man soared\nin, ignoring the scattered aliens and heading straight through the hole, before\nreappearing, carrying three civilians in his arms and depositing them away from\nthe gunfire. The other civilians had long since ran to the police barricades, a\nblock out in every direction.</p><p>\u201cPeter, take out the ones\ncoming to you. Rhodey, I\u2019m gonna deal with the outliers and I\u2019ll be back with\nyou right after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Tones,\u201d Rhodey\nconfirmed, a miniature missile shooting out from his shoulder and exploding\nnext to a car. The explosion seared the three aliens nearby and a car flipped\naway from it, smashing upon impact into a stranded city bus.</p><p>Peter stood, groaning as his\nhead rushed and colours danced before his eyes. </p><p>\u201cKid, you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Peter muttered,\nblinking it away.</p><p>The aliens below him were\nheaded for the barricade, so he leapt off the roof, shooting a web and swinging\ndown, his feet out in front of him and connecting with the back of the nearest\nET.</p><p>They turned on him then, Peter\nrolling as he landed the floor, shooting a web before he\u2019d finished turning to\nyank the weird weapon out of an alien\u2019s arm \u2013 only to find it attached.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark \u2013 I think the\nweapons are part of their bodies,\u201d Peter complained, flipping away as one shot\na red beam of pain at him. Somewhere behind him, it connected with a car and Peter\u2019s\nears rang with the explosion.</p><p>\u201c-got that, kid,\u201d Tony was\nsaying when he was done breathing through the pain, dodging the attacks of the\naliens. He had to start offence eventually, but his limbs were so heavy he\nthought they\u2019d drag him to the ground. Peter was comparing himself to an\nanchored ship in that moment, the anchor so heavy it was sinking the entire\nvessel into the ocean.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d drown on sea water\nbefore the aliens killed him.</p><p>Peter dispatched the first\none with a strong enough punch to send it flying into the wall of a building. Peter\ngroaned the whole way through.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony said in his\near. \u201cSeriously. What\u2019s up? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure, Mr Stark,\u201d Peter\nreplied, ducking under the swing of an alien and shooting a web at its feet,\nsticking them together. Peter lunged out with a kick, huffing at the exertion\nand then stumbling back at the same time as he alien. \u201cI\u2019m just a little tired,\nis all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d Rhodey asked over\nthe comms. \u201cKid, I can see you. You\u2019re stumbling around the place. How much\nsleep did you get last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d Peter\nreplied, mild, aiming a web for the street light and pulling himself up. He\nperched on it for a moment, watching the aliens spin to find him. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mr Stark. I\u2019m <i>trying</i> to sleep, it\u2019s just not\nhappening.\u201d</p><p>Peter backflipped off the\nstreet lamp only half a second before it disintegrated in the blast. He landed\non the wall, trying to blink away the shapes and colours that were blurring his\nvision. His danger sense caught him in time, screaming <i>MOVE </i>into the place where his spine and neck connected, Peter ducking\nout of the way just in time to avoid being killed.</p><p>\u201cNuh uh, kid,\u201d Rhodey said. \u201cThat\nwas two close calls in less than three seconds. Tones, I got too many on me,\ncan you cover your spider child for five minutes? He\u2019s gonna get killed at this\nrate.\u201d</p><p>Usually, Peter would protest,\nbut he didn\u2019t have it in him. Instead, he clambered up the wall, making it\nabout half way up the height of the apartment building before looking back at\nthe aliens. One still had its weapon pointed at him, while the other was\nlooking down towards the barricade and the masses of morbidly interested civilians\nwho just wouldn\u2019t leave the battle field.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d Tony said. \u201cRhodes,\nI left about three of them out here but I called in the Iron Legion. They\u2019ll be\nhere in eighty-six seconds.\u201d</p><p>Peter jumped off the wall\nwhen one of the aliens shot at him again, sending out a web just in time to\ncatch him \u2013 he\u2019d misjudged too many things about that jump; the height, how\nlong it would take to reach the ground, how long it would take for the web to\nattach to the opposite wall.</p><p>Rather, Peter skidded along\nthe ground before stumbling and flipping overhead, landing painfully on his\nback.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWipe out,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou\nokay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Behind him were the familiar\nsounds of the Iron Man repulsors, blasting the aliens straight to hell. Only a\nmoment later, he blinked his eyes open to see Tony leaning over him, face plate\nretracted to show his worried expression.</p><p>\u201cPeter. You with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, care to sit up?\u201d\nTony helped heave him up and Peter blinked, slow. He yawned and felt his spine\nsqueeze out every inch of pain it could. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a chat with you\nabout your health and sleeping habits,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s aliens invading,\nso do you mind if we do it later?\u201d</p><p>Peter waved a hand. \u201cThat\u2019s\nfine by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. So, you\u2019re\nbenched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Rhodey was right\nwith his calls. You almost got yourself killed too many times, you\u2019re half\nasleep right now and I\u2019m worried you\u2019re gonna crash and the alien\u2019s just gonna\nmerk you, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve never\nsaid <i>merk </i>before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not the point\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Danger to\nmyself and to others,\u201d Peter muttered, grabbing Tony\u2019s outstretched hand to\npull himself onto his swaying feet.</p><p>\u201cTones, the pack\u2019s splitting\nup. They\u2019re all headed out in different directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Tony said, his\nfaceplate slamming back into place. \u201cGet out of here, alright? Walk, maybe, not\nweb. I don\u2019t need a spider-shaped stain on the tarmac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing Mr-\u201d</p><p>There was a beam of red\nlight. Peter\u2019s breath getting caught in his throat. The feeling of <i>PUSH HIM </i>at the base of his neck. Peter\u2019s\nbody rarely had a chance to think about his actions when the danger sense was\nscreaming. No, Peter\u2019s body followed orders when there was danger, and so Peter\u2019s\narms flew out in front of him before he even had the chance to process-</p><p>-</p><p>On the video footage, caught\non a civilian\u2019s phone, half way down the block at the police barricade, the\naliens advanced to Spiderman and Iron Man, both of them up on their feet. Iron\nMan turned, just barely, towards the blast of red energy coming from its arm\ngun, before Spiderman shoved out his arms and pushed Iron Man so hard that he\nflew across the street, barely stopping himself before ramming into a building.</p><p>Spiderman, on the other hand,\nscreamed so loud it made the footage audio crackle. His back arched in the\nenergy beam before it shut off and Spiderman collapsed to the ground. Amid all\nthe screaming of the civilians \u2013 <i>did Spiderman\njust die? </i>\u2013 one word could be heard clear as day from Iron Man; <i>\u201cPETER!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>-</p><p>There was darkness to Peter.\nThere was darkness and something agonising, like his whole body was coming\napart at the seams, it he was disintegrating, undoing, being unmade second by\nsecond.</p><p>His eyes rolled back and\nthere was flares of pain as his body was turned, as something shuffled around\nhis face, as there were hands, hands, <i>hands.</i></p><p>There was the faint sound of\na voice, but Peter didn\u2019t know who he was anymore so he\u2019d never figure out the\nvoice. Peter didn\u2019t know himself. Peter didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>If you\u2019re not breathing, do\nyou exist?</p><p>If you can\u2019t see, can\u2019t hear,\ncan\u2019t feel anything but blinding pain and every molecule in your body coming undone,\ndo you exist?</p><p>If you\u2019re Peter, dying, in\nthis moment, do you exist?</p><p>-</p><p><i>Peter,\nPeter, Peter, Peter, Peter. Can you hear me? Peter! Come on. Come on, Peter.\nKid. Please. Christ. Rhodey! Rhodes- James. Please! He\u2019s not- he\u2019s not\nbreathing. He\u2019s- kid? Kid? Come on. I\u2019m doing CPR, Jesus, yes, I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m\ncounting, I know. He\u2019s- I don\u2019t know how to describe it, I don\u2019t. Peter. He\u2019s\nburnt. His suit\u2019s practically disintegrated. His skin is just blood, I don\u2019t- I\ndon\u2019t know- good. Good. Okay. How long until they get here? How- That\u2019s too\nlong. That\u2019s too long. Christ! Shit! Yes, yes, it\u2019s okay. Alien fuckers. CPR.\nCPR. CPR. Peter. Please. Don\u2019t leave me, kid. Don\u2019t do this right now. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>-</p><p>Peter existed sometimes.</p><p>Other times floated in a\nvoid, all black and blue and red \u2013 the colours changed with the faint, echoing\nsounds he could never decipher. They always sounded like voices; quiet whispers\nalong the edges of his consciousness.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find them. He couldn\u2019t\nreach them.</p><p>-</p><p><i>Hey,\nbaby. Hey, you can come back anytime, you know. We\u2019ll be happy to see you\nagain. I love you so much, sweetie. I don\u2019t love this haircut as much. You do\nlook kinda punk rock, though, with one side shaved. Maybe we\u2019ll have to cut it\nall off and start again \u2013 but maybe this look could work for you. The burns are\nhealing. Slowly, but they\u2019re healing. You can come back whenever you like,\nokay? I\u2019ll wait right here for you.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>-</p><p>There was a beeping sometimes\nin a very even rhythm. Peter liked even rhythms, liked the simplicity of them,\nhow sure they were.</p><p>Sometimes he heard shouts \u2013\nbut they were like the whispers; far, far away. The shouts were often accompanied\nwith his nice even rhythm vanishing into a long, monotone note.</p><p>-</p><p><i>Hey,\nPete. Tony won\u2019t be long. Pepper\u2019s making him shower \u2018cause he hasn\u2019t in, like,\na week. He\u2019s just been sitting here, you know? He\u2019s been working on a new suit\nfor you, though \u2013 apparently, it\u2019ll be stronger than the last one\u2026 He\u2019s\navoiding the press, I think. Pepper keeps muttering about it like we don\u2019t hear\nher. They have lots of questions, you know? Tony said your name when you went\ndown. Someone caught it on camera, and well \u2013 I think there\u2019s a distant shot of\nyour face, too. Though it\u2019s burned and\u2026 Yeah. Don\u2019t worry about that though,\nPete. Pepper and Tony are masters at the whole PR thing by this point. They\u2019ll\nfix it all up, no problem.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>-</p><p>He was always so fucking\ntired, whether he existed or not.</p><p>Peter just wanted to sleep\nfor an eternity.</p><p>-</p><p><i>Oh!\nAlright, then Raleigh and Mako pilot the jaeger right into the kaiju! They have\nthis really awesome fight sequence \u2013 you\u2019ve seen it. You know it!

Three or four are\ncoming towards my position \u2013 none seem capable of flight, so far. Oh! That one\nover there just blew a hole in a building!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, got that,\u201d Tony\nmuttered and Peter watched the Iron Man suit shoot off to where the building\nwas currently on fire.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark!\u201d Peter yelled,\nfeeling as if he should be more alert but his body unwilling. Iron Man soared\nin, ignoring the scattered aliens and heading straight through the hole, before\nreappearing, carrying three civilians in his arms and depositing them away from\nthe gunfire. The other civilians had long since ran to the police barricades, a\nblock out in every direction.</p><p>\u201cPeter, take out the ones\ncoming to you. Rhodey, I\u2019m gonna deal with the outliers and I\u2019ll be back with\nyou right after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, Tones,\u201d Rhodey\nconfirmed, a miniature missile shooting out from his shoulder and exploding\nnext to a car. The explosion seared the three aliens nearby and a car flipped\naway from it, smashing upon impact into a stranded city bus.</p><p>Peter stood, groaning as his\nhead rushed and colours danced before his eyes. </p><p>\u201cKid, you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Peter muttered,\nblinking it away.</p><p>The aliens below him were\nheaded for the barricade, so he leapt off the roof, shooting a web and swinging\ndown, his feet out in front of him and connecting with the back of the nearest\nET.</p><p>They turned on him then, Peter\nrolling as he landed the floor, shooting a web before he\u2019d finished turning to\nyank the weird weapon out of an alien\u2019s arm \u2013 only to find it attached.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark \u2013 I think the\nweapons are part of their bodies,\u201d Peter complained, flipping away as one shot\na red beam of pain at him. Somewhere behind him, it connected with a car and Peter\u2019s\nears rang with the explosion.</p><p>\u201c-got that, kid,\u201d Tony was\nsaying when he was done breathing through the pain, dodging the attacks of the\naliens. He had to start offence eventually, but his limbs were so heavy he\nthought they\u2019d drag him to the ground. Peter was comparing himself to an\nanchored ship in that moment, the anchor so heavy it was sinking the entire\nvessel into the ocean.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d drown on sea water\nbefore the aliens killed him.</p><p>Peter dispatched the first\none with a strong enough punch to send it flying into the wall of a building. Peter\ngroaned the whole way through.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony said in his\near. \u201cSeriously. What\u2019s up? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure, Mr Stark,\u201d Peter\nreplied, ducking under the swing of an alien and shooting a web at its feet,\nsticking them together. Peter lunged out with a kick, huffing at the exertion\nand then stumbling back at the same time as he alien. \u201cI\u2019m just a little tired,\nis all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d Rhodey asked over\nthe comms. \u201cKid, I can see you. You\u2019re stumbling around the place. How much\nsleep did you get last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d Peter\nreplied, mild, aiming a web for the street light and pulling himself up. He\nperched on it for a moment, watching the aliens spin to find him. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mr Stark. I\u2019m <i>trying</i> to sleep, it\u2019s just not\nhappening.\u201d</p><p>Peter backflipped off the\nstreet lamp only half a second before it disintegrated in the blast. He landed\non the wall, trying to blink away the shapes and colours that were blurring his\nvision. His danger sense caught him in time, screaming <i>MOVE </i>into the place where his spine and neck connected, Peter ducking\nout of the way just in time to avoid being killed.</p><p>\u201cNuh uh, kid,\u201d Rhodey said. \u201cThat\nwas two close calls in less than three seconds. Tones, I got too many on me,\ncan you cover your spider child for five minutes? He\u2019s gonna get killed at this\nrate.\u201d</p><p>Usually, Peter would protest,\nbut he didn\u2019t have it in him. Instead, he clambered up the wall, making it\nabout half way up the height of the apartment building before looking back at\nthe aliens. One still had its weapon pointed at him, while the other was\nlooking down towards the barricade and the masses of morbidly interested civilians\nwho just wouldn\u2019t leave the battle field.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d Tony said. \u201cRhodes,\nI left about three of them out here but I called in the Iron Legion. They\u2019ll be\nhere in eighty-six seconds.\u201d</p><p>Peter jumped off the wall\nwhen one of the aliens shot at him again, sending out a web just in time to\ncatch him \u2013 he\u2019d misjudged too many things about that jump; the height, how\nlong it would take to reach the ground, how long it would take for the web to\nattach to the opposite wall.</p><p>Rather, Peter skidded along\nthe ground before stumbling and flipping overhead, landing painfully on his\nback.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWipe out,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou\nokay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Behind him were the familiar\nsounds of the Iron Man repulsors, blasting the aliens straight to hell. Only a\nmoment later, he blinked his eyes open to see Tony leaning over him, face plate\nretracted to show his worried expression.</p><p>\u201cPeter. You with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, care to sit up?\u201d\nTony helped heave him up and Peter blinked, slow. He yawned and felt his spine\nsqueeze out every inch of pain it could. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a chat with you\nabout your health and sleeping habits,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s aliens invading,\nso do you mind if we do it later?\u201d</p><p>Peter waved a hand. \u201cThat\u2019s\nfine by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. So, you\u2019re\nbenched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Rhodey was right\nwith his calls. You almost got yourself killed too many times, you\u2019re half\nasleep right now and I\u2019m worried you\u2019re gonna crash and the alien\u2019s just gonna\nmerk you, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve never\nsaid <i>merk </i>before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not the point\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Danger to\nmyself and to others,\u201d Peter muttered, grabbing Tony\u2019s outstretched hand to\npull himself onto his swaying feet.</p><p>\u201cTones, the pack\u2019s splitting\nup. They\u2019re all headed out in different directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Tony said, his\nfaceplate slamming back into place. \u201cGet out of here, alright? Walk, maybe, not\nweb. I don\u2019t need a spider-shaped stain on the tarmac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing Mr-\u201d</p><p>There was a beam of red\nlight. Peter\u2019s breath getting caught in his throat. The feeling of <i>PUSH HIM </i>at the base of his neck. Peter\u2019s\nbody rarely had a chance to think about his actions when the danger sense was\nscreaming. No, Peter\u2019s body followed orders when there was danger, and so Peter\u2019s\narms flew out in front of him before he even had the chance to process-</p><p>-</p><p>On the video footage, caught\non a civilian\u2019s phone, half way down the block at the police barricade, the\naliens advanced to Spiderman and Iron Man, both of them up on their feet. Iron\nMan turned, just barely, towards the blast of red energy coming from its arm\ngun, before Spiderman shoved out his arms and pushed Iron Man so hard that he\nflew across the street, barely stopping himself before ramming into a building.</p><p>Spiderman, on the other hand,\nscreamed so loud it made the footage audio crackle. His back arched in the\nenergy beam before it shut off and Spiderman collapsed to the ground. Amid all\nthe screaming of the civilians \u2013 <i>did Spiderman\njust die? </i>\u2013 one word could be heard clear as day from Iron Man; <i>\u201cPETER!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>-</p><p>There was darkness to Peter.\nThere was darkness and something agonising, like his whole body was coming\napart at the seams, it he was disintegrating, undoing, being unmade second by\nsecond.</p><p>His eyes rolled back and\nthere was flares of pain as his body was turned, as something shuffled around\nhis face, as there were hands, hands, <i>hands.</i></p><p>There was the faint sound of\na voice, but Peter didn\u2019t know who he was anymore so he\u2019d never figure out the\nvoice. Peter didn\u2019t know himself.

Peter liked even rhythms, liked the simplicity of them,\nhow sure they were.</p><p>Sometimes he heard shouts \u2013\nbut they were like the whispers; far, far away. The shouts were often accompanied\nwith his nice even rhythm vanishing into a long, monotone note.</p><p>-</p><p><i>Hey,\nPete. Tony won\u2019t be long.

He had to start offence eventually, but his limbs were so heavy he\nthought they\u2019d drag him to the ground.

I\u2019m <i>trying</i> to sleep, it\u2019s just not\nhappening.\u201d</p><p>Peter backflipped off the\nstreet lamp only half a second before it disintegrated in the blast.

Tones, I got too many on me,\ncan you cover your spider child for five minutes? He\u2019s gonna get killed at this\nrate.\u201d</p><p>Usually, Peter would protest,\nbut he didn\u2019t have it in him. Instead, he clambered up the wall, making it\nabout half way up the height of the apartment building before looking back at\nthe aliens. One still had its weapon pointed at him, while the other was\nlooking down towards the barricade and the masses of morbidly interested civilians\nwho just wouldn\u2019t leave the battle field.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d Tony said. \u201cRhodes,\nI left about three of them out here but I called in the Iron Legion. They\u2019ll be\nhere in eighty-six seconds.\u201d</p><p>Peter jumped off the wall\nwhen one of the aliens shot at him again, sending out a web just in time to\ncatch him \u2013 he\u2019d misjudged too many things about that jump; the height, how\nlong it would take to reach the ground, how long it would take for the web to\nattach to the opposite wall.</p><p>Rather, Peter skidded along\nthe ground before stumbling and flipping overhead, landing painfully on his\nback.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWipe out,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou\nokay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Behind him were the familiar\nsounds of the Iron Man repulsors, blasting the aliens straight to hell. Only a\nmoment later, he blinked his eyes open to see Tony leaning over him, face plate\nretracted to show his worried expression.</p><p>\u201cPeter. You with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, care to sit up?\u201d\nTony helped heave him up and Peter blinked, slow. He yawned and felt his spine\nsqueeze out every inch of pain it could. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a chat with you\nabout your health and sleeping habits,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s aliens invading,\nso do you mind if we do it later?\u201d</p><p>Peter waved a hand. \u201cThat\u2019s\nfine by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. So, you\u2019re\nbenched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Stark-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Rhodey was right\nwith his calls. You almost got yourself killed too many times, you\u2019re half\nasleep right now and I\u2019m worried you\u2019re gonna crash and the alien\u2019s just gonna\nmerk you, okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve never\nsaid <i>merk </i>before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not the point\nhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Danger to\nmyself and to others,\u201d Peter muttered, grabbing Tony\u2019s outstretched hand to\npull himself onto his swaying feet.</p><p>\u201cTones, the pack\u2019s splitting\nup. They\u2019re all headed out in different directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Tony said, his\nfaceplate slamming back into place. \u201cGet out of here, alright? Walk, maybe, not\nweb. I don\u2019t need a spider-shaped stain on the tarmac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing Mr-\u201d</p><p>There was a beam of red\nlight. Peter\u2019s breath getting caught in his throat. The feeling of <i>PUSH HIM </i>at the base of his neck. Peter\u2019s\nbody rarely had a chance to think about his actions when the danger sense was\nscreaming. No, Peter\u2019s body followed orders when there was danger, and so Peter\u2019s\narms flew out in front of him before he even had the chance to process-</p><p>-</p><p>On the video footage, caught\non a civilian\u2019s phone, half way down the block at the police barricade, the\naliens advanced to Spiderman and Iron Man, both of them up on their feet. Iron\nMan turned, just barely, towards the blast of red energy coming from its arm\ngun, before Spiderman shoved out his arms and pushed Iron Man so hard that he\nflew across the street, barely stopping himself before ramming into a building.</p><p>Spiderman, on the other hand,\nscreamed so loud it made the footage audio crackle. His back arched in the\nenergy beam before it shut off and Spiderman collapsed to the ground. Amid all\nthe screaming of the civilians \u2013 <i>did Spiderman\njust die? </i>\u2013 one word could be heard clear as day from Iron Man; <i>\u201cPETER!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>-</p><p>There was darkness to Peter.\nThere was darkness and something agonising, like his whole body was coming\napart at the seams, it he was disintegrating, undoing, being unmade second by\nsecond.</p><p>His eyes rolled back and\nthere was flares of pain as his body was turned, as something shuffled around\nhis face, as there were hands, hands, <i>hands.</i></p><p>There was the faint sound of\na voice, but Peter didn\u2019t know who he was anymore so he\u2019d never figure out the\nvoice.

He&rsquo;s gonna get killed at this\nrate.&rdquo;</p><p>Usually, Peter would protest,\nbut he didn&rsquo;t have it in him. Instead, he clambered up the wall, making it\nabout half way up the height of the apartment building before looking back at\nthe aliens. One still had its weapon pointed at him, while the other was\nlooking down towards the barricade and the masses of morbidly interested civilians\nwho just wouldn&rsquo;t leave the battle field.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Rhodes,\nI left about three of them out here but I called in the Iron Legion. They&rsquo;ll be\nhere in eighty-six seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter jumped off the wall\nwhen one of the aliens shot at him again, sending out a web just in time to\ncatch him &ndash; he&rsquo;d misjudged too many things about that jump; the height, how\nlong it would take to reach the ground, how long it would take for the web to\nattach to the opposite wall.</p><p>Rather, Peter skidded along\nthe ground before stumbling and flipping overhead, landing painfully on his\nback.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;Wipe out,&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;You\nokay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>Behind him were the familiar\nsounds of the Iron Man repulsors, blasting the aliens straight to hell. Only a\nmoment later, he blinked his eyes open to see Tony leaning over him, face plate\nretracted to show his worried expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter. You with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ya-huh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, care to sit up?&rdquo;\nTony helped heave him up and Peter blinked, slow. He yawned and felt his spine\nsqueeze out every inch of pain it could. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have a chat with you\nabout your health and sleeping habits,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s aliens invading,\nso do you mind if we do it later?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter waved a hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nfine by me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. So, you&rsquo;re\nbenched.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Stark-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, Rhodey was right\nwith his calls. You almost got yourself killed too many times, you&rsquo;re half\nasleep right now and I&rsquo;m worried you&rsquo;re gonna crash and the alien&rsquo;s just gonna\nmerk you, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter frowned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never\nsaid <i>merk </i>before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really not the point\nhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, right. Danger to\nmyself and to others,&rdquo; Peter muttered, grabbing Tony&rsquo;s outstretched hand to\npull himself onto his swaying feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Tones, the pack&rsquo;s splitting\nup. They&rsquo;re all headed out in different directions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Tony said, his\nfaceplate slamming back into place. &ldquo;Get out of here, alright? Walk, maybe, not\nweb. I don&rsquo;t need a spider-shaped stain on the tarmac.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure thing Mr-&rdquo;</p><p>There was a beam of red\nlight. Peter&rsquo;s breath getting caught in his throat. The feeling of <i>PUSH HIM </i>at the base of his neck. Peter&rsquo;s\nbody rarely had a chance to think about his actions when the danger sense was\nscreaming. No, Peter&rsquo;s body followed orders when there was danger, and so Peter&rsquo;s\narms flew out in front of him before he even had the chance to process-</p><p>-</p><p>On the video footage, caught\non a civilian&rsquo;s phone, half way down the block at the police barricade, the\naliens advanced to Spiderman and Iron Man, both of them up on their feet. Iron\nMan turned, just barely, towards the blast of red energy coming from its arm\ngun, before Spiderman shoved out his arms and pushed Iron Man so hard that he\nflew across the street, barely stopping himself before ramming into a building.</p><p>Spiderman, on the other hand,\nscreamed so loud it made the footage audio crackle. His back arched in the\nenergy beam before it shut off and Spiderman collapsed to the ground. Amid all\nthe screaming of the civilians &ndash; <i>did Spiderman\njust die? </i>&ndash; one word could be heard clear as day from Iron Man; <i>&ldquo;PETER!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>-</p><p>There was darkness to Peter.\nThere was darkness and something agonising, like his whole body was coming\napart at the seams, it he was disintegrating, undoing, being unmade second by\nsecond.</p><p>His eyes rolled back and\nthere was flares of pain as his body was turned, as something shuffled around\nhis face, as there were hands, hands, <i>hands.</i></p><p>There was the faint sound of\na voice, but Peter didn&rsquo;t know who he was anymore so he&rsquo;d never figure out the\nvoice. Peter didn&rsquo;t know himself. Peter didn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not breathing, do\nyou exist?</p><p>If you can&rsquo;t see, can&rsquo;t hear,\ncan&rsquo;t feel anything but blinding pain and every molecule in your body coming undone,\ndo you exist?</p><p>If you&rsquo;re Peter, dying, in\nthis moment, do you exist?</p><p>-</p><p><i>Peter,\nPeter, Peter, Peter, Peter.

Hey, you can come back anytime, you know. We&rsquo;ll be happy to see you\nagain. I love you so much, sweetie. I don&rsquo;t love this haircut as much.

I&rsquo;ll wait right here for you.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>-</p><p>There was a beeping sometimes\nin a very even rhythm. Peter liked even rhythms, liked the simplicity of them,\nhow sure they were.</p><p>Sometimes he heard shouts &ndash;\nbut they were like the whispers; far, far away. The shouts were often accompanied\nwith his nice even rhythm vanishing into a long, monotone note.</p><p>-</p><p><i>Hey,\nPete. Tony won&rsquo;t be long.

Yeah, Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d only been asleep for a\nmoment, as far as he could tell. Below him, the portal to another world was\nstill open in the middle of the New York street; aliens racing out with their\nstrange, glowing red weapons and armour that looked like bone. Iron Man and War\nMachine (<i>cough</i> Iron Patriot <i>cough</i>) stood back to back on the road,\nguns firing and lasers shooting out in bright beams.</p>\n<p>It was just the three of them.\nVision had disappeared two weeks ago and was yet to return &ndash; though, secretly,\nPeter had a feeling he wouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; and the rest of the Avengers were off&hellip; Peter\ndidn&rsquo;t know, being war criminals? He wasn&rsquo;t sure. But they weren&rsquo;t here during\nan alien invasion.</p>\n<p>Luckily, it was much smaller\nthan the Battle of New York one. More like a scouting party; a prelude to a\nbigger battle that would be the main event.</p>\n<p>Peter reached the top of the\nbuilding, head aching, eyes blinking so slowly black dots were appearing across\nhis vision. God, he was fucking <i>tired.</i>\nHe hadn&rsquo;t been sleeping recently; just couldn&rsquo;t, just laid down every night and\nstared at the next bunk up until morning shone through his window. He hadn&rsquo;t\nbeen going out as Spiderman when he felt like this &ndash; no, Mr Stark had told him\nto look after himself, so he was trying. And, besides, if Peter used the suit\nbetween two and six AM, Tony heard about it and would be out there on the\nstreets of Queens, nagging him until he returned to bed.</p>\n<p>So Peter was tired. Peter was\nfucking exhausted, but Peter was also in the middle of an alien invasion, so he\nhad to focus.</p>\n</p>",

He had set up his pranks the say before. He had replaced all the ice cream with mashed potatoes, covered the TV remotes with tape, taped cut out bugs to the inside of the lamps, put grass seeds in all the keyboards, and froze mentos in the ice cubes.</p><p><br></p><p>Peter knew for a fact that Bucky ate ice cream every morning for breakfast, so he was in for a surprise. And it was a wonder that no one said anything when Peter stared to record Bucky getting his breakfast. He grabbed the whole tub and a spoon and sat down. He took a big spoonful, and shoveled it into his mouth. He immediately opened his mouth and let it fall back out. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat. The.

He stripped Peter, and then cuffed Peter to the headboard, face down, ass up.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou know how bad boys get punished? They get spankings. You think you can take twenty?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, daddy\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony knelt on the bed behind Peter, fully clothed. He grabbed his ass in his hands, massaging it a bit. Tony sat back on his heels to admire Peter\u2019s ass, before smacking it. Hard. Peter let out a moan.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna use my belt, ok, baby?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPlease, daddy.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony undid his belt and pulled it out of the loops of his pants. He wrapped part of it around his hand, leaving a tail on it. He raised his arm, and brought it down on Peter\u2019s ass. Peter let out a loud moan in response. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou like that, baby? Hmm?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, daddy, harder!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony complied and brought down the belt once again. And again. And again. Until Peter\u2019s ass was cherry red and hot to the touch. Tears made their way down Peter\u2019s face.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDaddy, I need you!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cShh, baby, I\u2019ll give you what you need.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI need your cock, daddy!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony pressed a kiss to the back of his neck. He then got off the bed and pulled his clothes off. He grabbed the lube from the bedside table and lubed up his cock. He got back on the bed, and spread Peter\u2019s ass, exposing his hole, still wet from last nights activities. Tony buried his face in between the plump cheeks, and began to lick at Peter\u2019s hole. Peter let out little moans at the feeling of Tony\u2019s warm tongue dipping in and out of him. Tony pulled back and lined up with Peter.</p><p><br></p><p>He pushed in, prompting a groan from both of them. He stilled once he was fully in Peter\u2019s ass, letting his adjust for a second before he moved. Peter let out a muffled scream as Tony brushed against his prostate with every thrust. Tony had sunk two fingers into Peter\u2019 mouth. Peter sucked at his fingers as Tony fucked him hard. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make me cum, baby.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cCum in my ass, daddy!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony pounded into him. He could feel Peter clenching around him, signalling that he was close. Peter\u2019s ass clenched once more before Tony came in him with a groan. Peter came shortly after, biting back screams. Tony reached up and freed Peter\u2019s hands before laying down beside him. They were both covered in sweat.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou look so hot after sex.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou always look hot, baby.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Peter blushed at the compliment. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThank you, daddy.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPromise me one thing?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo more pranks.

The first time he did so, Tony found it fascinating. Stephen had grinned as Tony wandered around New York City in an alternate reality.

Or walking, for that matter) Tony down to Times Square. He pinned Tony to the side of the nearest building before creating the mirror dimension. He rocked his hips into Tony\u2019s, kissing him hard as the people hustled around them. Tony pawed at Stephen\u2019s growing erection. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you. In front of all these people, where anyone could see.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Tony moaned.

Now.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Stephen muttered a lubercating spell under his breath, making Tony drip. Stephen used another spell to rid Tony and himself of their clothes. He reached down with two fingers and teased his hole. Tony let out a moan as Stephen sank two fingers into him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOoh, Stephen, you\u2019re such a good boy!\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Stephen pressed his lips to Tony\u2019s as he slid inside Tony.
