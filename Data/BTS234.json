By this time, he would normally be at work.</p><p>But today was different.</p><p>He stood at the door with a question.

He opened the door and slammed it shut behind him. Omelas has changed since last night. Two more buildings have fallen and the people have gotten uneasy. When his eyes drifted across the street, he saw that numerous doorknobs on the houses have been bent or snapped away. he looked at his own doorknob. Nothing special, just a doorknob that he\u2019s used so many times before. But now it meant the same question for him as the door.</p><p><i>Left or right?</i></p><p>He let go of the cold metal, set his bag on the ground and with a powerful kick, he made the metal bend slightly.</p><p><i>Are you sure? </i>asked the doorknob.</p><p>He kicked again, stronger this time. The metal bent more, the doorknob repeating its question, more quietly this time.</p><p>Hoseok brought his leg up and kicked for the third time. The weakened metal jumped away and played a soft ringing melody against the pavement.</p><p><i>Very well, then. Goodbye. </i>said a faint voice.</p><p>Hoseok bent down to look at the doorknob more closely.</p><p>He\u2019s chosen his path with the first kick.</p><p>Left.</p><p>He picked up his bag and turned back to the street. No more questions.</p><p>Today was a strange day. The people of Omelas weren\u2019t piling in lines to get to the festival grounds like every year. The Ferris wheel, the rollercoasters and all the stands were empty. The mayor, who would give a speech on the opening day of the festival was still buried under the tons of marble that came down with the city hall. Today was a strange day indeed, but the strangest thing had to be the happy people of Omelas accumulating at the city gates.</p><p>Most of the time, people walked away alone and in silence, if anything, leaving behind only a broken doorknob.</p><p>But today was a strange day.</p><p>Hoseok couldn\u2019t help but think the same thing as he came around the corner to see a crowd of people leaving through the gate, all of them snuggling in their warmest coats with a bag in hand.</p><p>Hoseok stopped at the edge of the gate, the crowd giving him time for one last look at the city of happiness, the beautiful buildings and the cracking impression of paradise.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d chimed a voice from below.</p><p>Hoseok looked to his feet finding the gate dweller there. He was watching the crowd move out of the city with a sheepish smile, wrapped in the little clothes he had on his body.</p><p>\u201cSure is, until it falls down on you,\u201d Hoseok responded. The man stood up, now on the level with him.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re walking away? You\u2019re scared of a few bricks falling down?\u201d said the man.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhy are you waiting here like that anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to leave, but I don\u2019t want to go alone,\u201d replied the man and looked to his bare feet.</p><p>\u201cHoseok reached into his bag and pulled out a pair of winter boots he packed. \u201cHere, the journey will be long,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat journey?\u201d asked the man, cautiously taking the boots and trying them on. They were a bit big but good enough for him.</p><p>\u201cOur journey,\u201d said Hoseok and pulled out a coat from the bag.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to walk with me?\u201d asked the man.</p><p>\u201cNot only that. I\u2019m gonna make sure you never walk alone again,\u201d smiled Hoseok.</p><p>The man hugged him tightly, the gifted coat almost falling off his shoulders. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Jung Hoseok, by the way,\u201d he said when they parted and offered a handshake.</p><p>\u201cKim Taehyung, but please, call me Tae,\u201d he accepted the handshake.</p><p>Hoseok grabbed his bag again.</p><p>The crowd was gone by now, all the people lost in the farmlands around the walls.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Asked Hoseok.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve waited for this moment for 4 months, of course, I\u2019m ready,\u201d laughed Tae.</p><p>They crossed the border of the city, leaving the beautiful gate behind them.</p><p>They weren\u2019t sure where exactly they were going yet, but at that moment, both of them knew that he had found Omelas in the other.</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>Seokjin couldn\u2019t stop pacing back and forth through his apartment. Half of his mind was worried about himself, whether he is still safe in his house, whether he should move to avoid being the next one buried under marble. The second half, albeit quieter, was worried about Hoseok. Jin was afraid that Hoseok would do something stupid, that he took his words to the heart, that he had lost his friend to the cold forever.</p><p>He ran out of his home, only in his sweatpants and a sweatshirt.

It was the next morning, he&rsquo;s already had his breakfast, he&rsquo;s already gotten dressed. By this time, he would normally be at work.</p><p>But today was different.</p><p>He stood at the door with a question. More of a choice than a question, actually.</p><p>The choice was simply in the direction he was going to go once he gets out of the door before him.</p><p>He could go right, down the street to Seokjin&rsquo;s apologize and hope to mend their friendship.</p><p>He could go left, around the block and straight to the wall, through the gate and walk away from the city of Omelas like the hundreds before him.</p><p>He could go back inside, forget about the street, forget about the gate, forget about Seokjin and anything that isn&rsquo;t inside his house.</p><p>He could forget, but he refused to. He opened the door and slammed it shut behind him. Omelas has changed since last night. Two more buildings have fallen and the people have gotten uneasy. When his eyes drifted across the street, he saw that numerous doorknobs on the houses have been bent or snapped away. he looked at his own doorknob. Nothing special, just a doorknob that he&rsquo;s used so many times before. But now it meant the same question for him as the door.</p><p><i>Left or right?</i></p><p>He let go of the cold metal, set his bag on the ground and with a powerful kick, he made the metal bend slightly.</p><p><i>Are you sure? </i>asked the doorknob.</p><p>He kicked again, stronger this time. The metal bent more, the doorknob repeating its question, more quietly this time.</p><p>Hoseok brought his leg up and kicked for the third time. The weakened metal jumped away and played a soft ringing melody against the pavement.</p><p><i>Very well, then. Goodbye. </i>said a faint voice.</p><p>Hoseok bent down to look at the doorknob more closely.</p><p>He&rsquo;s chosen his path with the first kick.</p><p>Left.</p><p>He picked up his bag and turned back to the street. No more questions.</p><p>Today was a strange day. The people of Omelas weren&rsquo;t piling in lines to get to the festival grounds like every year. The Ferris wheel, the rollercoasters and all the stands were empty. The mayor, who would give a speech on the opening day of the festival was still buried under the tons of marble that came down with the city hall. Today was a strange day indeed, but the strangest thing had to be the happy people of Omelas accumulating at the city gates.</p><p>Most of the time, people walked away alone and in silence, if anything, leaving behind only a broken doorknob.</p><p>But today was a strange day.</p><p>Hoseok couldn&rsquo;t help but think the same thing as he came around the corner to see a crowd of people leaving through the gate, all of them snuggling in their warmest coats with a bag in hand.</p><p>Hoseok stopped at the edge of the gate, the crowd giving him time for one last look at the city of happiness, the beautiful buildings and the cracking impression of paradise.</p><p>&ldquo;Beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; chimed a voice from below.</p><p>Hoseok looked to his feet finding the gate dweller there.
