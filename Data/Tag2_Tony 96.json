The bartender took one look at Bucky before he unscrewed the serving tip off of a bottle of rum and handed him the half-full bottle. Bucky grinned, all teeth, and poured himself a generous serving into a glass and knocked back the drink with his good hand.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there, might want to slow down,\u201d a voice said from his left. He turned sharply and almost lost his breath as he met the gaze of the most beautiful man he\u2019d seen in a while. He was clearly older. Silver threaded through his hair and was peppered in his well-groomed goatee, but he wore his age well.

Stephen\u2019s lips MOVED DOWN, meaning sadness as well, and FRUSTRATION. It makes total sense for Stephen to be sad, the first reason is: he needs Tony to cooperate, and second, he WANTS to be respected by Tony and at the moment, Tony is not respecting him or showing any kind of admiration. Someone normally expects respect EMOTIONALLY from someone when they ADMIRE that someone, in other words, Stephen didn\u2019t need to show SADNESS, he could just be angry, HOWEVER his lips indicate an expression of sadness, so Tony not respecting and even despising him makes him SAD. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"642\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78d8c6320ad2f4dfeceac1c0214722b0/tumblr_inline_pow5apGXI71uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"642\" data-orig-height=\"342\"/></figure><p>Tony exposes his chest, raises his chin (it\u2019s a warning of dominance, he\u2019s responding against the act of being hit by the Cloak) and contracts one of the corners of his mouth, that normally means CONTEMPT, in other words, Tony didn\u2019t like being hit and he\u2019s thinking low of Stephen for doing so.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"566\" data-orig-height=\"328\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d346519d3ac37f9f36a7254e7fae7191/tumblr_inline_pow4xy4ri71uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"566\" data-orig-height=\"328\"/></figure><p>However, Tony isn\u2019t an irrational brat, so what does he do? He changes subject and starts talking about the Time Stone and how they should get rid of it. Tony OPENS his chest and STOPS STARING Stephen, meaning that Tony isn\u2019t focusing on his anger anymore. In other words, Stephen (or the Cloak :3) succeeded at getting Tony\u2019s attention and now Tony is inserted in the conversation talking about what he thinks. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"665\" data-orig-height=\"337\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15471b414472afffcfc0b045f2430bde/tumblr_inline_pow52ioI121uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"665\" data-orig-height=\"337\"/></figure><p>Stephen, despite feeling a bit angry at first, now returned to his initial state, his eyebrows aren\u2019t tense and he\u2019s talking about the problem to Tony, looking directly at him. This means Stephen is giving priority to the danger Thanos is bringing while being open to Tony (showing trust) since his hands are not in front of his chest or lips. Stephen basically left what he was feeling aside and now his eyebrows returned to the initial tension.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"603\" data-orig-height=\"341\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95b1d9162eedb39c8fee395110aeda8b/tumblr_inline_pow56hQ3eI1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"603\" data-orig-height=\"341\"/></figure><p>When Tony mentioned throwing the Time Stone away, Wong is clearly affected by it. His eyebrows contract a lot more than they were and he moves his body forward in disagreement. His lips contracted as well, but not laterally expanding it, but making his mouth sound \u201cshorter\u201d, that normally is an expression of anger. The idea the Time Stone could mean so little to Tony angers him, but he still has the same position as before, meaning he still trusts Tony and that he still is open to the conversation.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"579\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e409c493f0d18647e40949db051eef6a/tumblr_inline_pow5kwUsVE1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"579\" data-orig-height=\"342\"/></figure><p>Tony is super tense, so he starts talking about the ice cream and dairy subject, that has nothing to do with the serious conversation. Tony\u2019s eyebrows are strongly raised, his eyes also are a bit more open than the usual and his lips still are contracted, but externally: this is an expression of fear. Basically, Tony is anxious and scared and he\u2019s trying to calm down and tell himself all the situation is common and ordinary by inserting a silly ordinary fact in the middle of it. He\u2019s trying to calm himself. It might seem Tony is doing that just to disrespect Stephen and everyone in the room, however, he has a strong respect for Bruce, so no, Tony isn\u2019t doing that with the main objective of disrespecting anyone, even if his attitude is disrespectful, he\u2019s doing that trying to calm himself down.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"545\" data-orig-height=\"343\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67bb3137dbd22093209d126a72471164/tumblr_inline_pow5pparHa1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"545\" data-orig-height=\"343\"/></figure><p>Stephen lowers his head, normally, that means shame or when someone is facing or remembering about an unpleasant fact. At this point I believe Stephen NOTICED how tense Tony was, so what did he do? He joined Tony\u2019s game. The natural behavior we could expect was Stephen to say \u201cTHIS IS SERIOUS! WHY ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT ICE CREAM??\u201d but Stephen knows why Tony is talking about ice cream, he\u2019s scared, trying to calm down, and Stephen is scared and tense as well, so he joins the game and starts talking about his own ice cream experience too.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"555\" data-orig-height=\"345\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/637f5f80c5144553b2270d5092bfc272/tumblr_inline_pow5w3q9Jk1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"555\" data-orig-height=\"345\"/></figure><p>Stephen congrats his lip to the upper side (easier to see if you watch that moment of the video), an expression of disgust. He\u2019s absolutely not disgusted of Tony, so what is he disgusted of? The ice cream he\u2019s talking about. Stephen indeed tried that ice cream (Wong\u2019s speech confirms that and suggests Stephen and Wong like going out trying many different ice cream flavors considering they even know the name of the many flavors!). We can conclude Stephen indeed tried Tony\u2019s ice cream and didn\u2019t like it, that means one of the two things: either Stephen is too picky or the Tony based ice cream was way too terrible. His face facing down could indicate the experience he\u2019s thinking about was terrible.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"635\" data-orig-height=\"387\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e968bc7db51d24e25aeeecb867f5a76b/tumblr_inline_pow60aWvzt1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"635\" data-orig-height=\"387\"/></figure><p>Soon after that moment, Stephen gives Tony a pause and then returns to the topic, explaining how the Time Stone is important and talking more about the dangers Thanos is about to bring. His forehead returned to the initial point of tension, meaning he isn\u2019t angry or sad anymore, he put his rational side into action and expects Tony to do the same. Now, Stephen knows he has to be more convincing so Tony will take him seriously, so he raises his chin more than before, showing Tony he\u2019s as \u201calpha\u201d as he is and that he is strong, serious and that he is good/competent as well, despite needing Tony\u2019s help.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"524\" data-orig-height=\"324\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b873de7f1ae4170f633e0d75225b633/tumblr_inline_pow5xhwnYl1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"524\" data-orig-height=\"324\"/></figure><p>So, did you like it?

Someone normally expects respect EMOTIONALLY from someone when they ADMIRE that someone, in other words, Stephen didn\u2019t need to show SADNESS, he could just be angry, HOWEVER his lips indicate an expression of sadness, so Tony not respecting and even despising him makes him SAD. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"642\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78d8c6320ad2f4dfeceac1c0214722b0/tumblr_inline_pow5apGXI71uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"642\" data-orig-height=\"342\"></figure><p>Tony exposes his chest, raises his chin (it\u2019s a warning of dominance, he\u2019s responding against the act of being hit by the Cloak) and contracts one of the corners of his mouth, that normally means CONTEMPT, in other words, Tony didn\u2019t like being hit and he\u2019s thinking low of Stephen for doing so.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"566\" data-orig-height=\"328\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d346519d3ac37f9f36a7254e7fae7191/tumblr_inline_pow4xy4ri71uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"566\" data-orig-height=\"328\"></figure><p>However, Tony isn\u2019t an irrational brat, so what does he do?

In other words, Stephen (or the Cloak :3) succeeded at getting Tony\u2019s attention and now Tony is inserted in the conversation talking about what he thinks. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"665\" data-orig-height=\"337\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15471b414472afffcfc0b045f2430bde/tumblr_inline_pow52ioI121uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"665\" data-orig-height=\"337\"></figure><p>Stephen, despite feeling a bit angry at first, now returned to his initial state, his eyebrows aren\u2019t tense and he\u2019s talking about the problem to Tony, looking directly at him.

His eyebrows contract a lot more than they were and he moves his body forward in disagreement. His lips contracted as well, but not laterally expanding it, but making his mouth sound \u201cshorter\u201d, that normally is an expression of anger. The idea the Time Stone could mean so little to Tony angers him, but he still has the same position as before, meaning he still trusts Tony and that he still is open to the conversation.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"579\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e409c493f0d18647e40949db051eef6a/tumblr_inline_pow5kwUsVE1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"579\" data-orig-height=\"342\"></figure><p>Tony is super tense, so he starts talking about the ice cream and dairy subject, that has nothing to do with the serious conversation. Tony\u2019s eyebrows are strongly raised, his eyes also are a bit more open than the usual and his lips still are contracted, but externally: this is an expression of fear. Basically, Tony is anxious and scared and he\u2019s trying to calm down and tell himself all the situation is common and ordinary by inserting a silly ordinary fact in the middle of it. He\u2019s trying to calm himself. It might seem Tony is doing that just to disrespect Stephen and everyone in the room, however, he has a strong respect for Bruce, so no, Tony isn\u2019t doing that with the main objective of disrespecting anyone, even if his attitude is disrespectful, he\u2019s doing that trying to calm himself down.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"545\" data-orig-height=\"343\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67bb3137dbd22093209d126a72471164/tumblr_inline_pow5pparHa1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"545\" data-orig-height=\"343\"></figure><p>Stephen lowers his head, normally, that means shame or when someone is facing or remembering about an unpleasant fact. At this point I believe Stephen NOTICED how tense Tony was, so what did he do? He joined Tony\u2019s game. The natural behavior we could expect was Stephen to say \u201cTHIS IS SERIOUS! WHY ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT ICE CREAM??\u201d but Stephen knows why Tony is talking about ice cream, he\u2019s scared, trying to calm down, and Stephen is scared and tense as well, so he joins the game and starts talking about his own ice cream experience too.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"555\" data-orig-height=\"345\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/637f5f80c5144553b2270d5092bfc272/tumblr_inline_pow5w3q9Jk1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"555\" data-orig-height=\"345\"></figure><p>Stephen congrats his lip to the upper side (easier to see if you watch that moment of the video), an expression of disgust.

Stephen indeed tried that ice cream (Wong\u2019s speech confirms that and suggests Stephen and Wong like going out trying many different ice cream flavors considering they even know the name of the many flavors!). We can conclude Stephen indeed tried Tony\u2019s ice cream and didn\u2019t like it, that means one of the two things: either Stephen is too picky or the Tony based ice cream was way too terrible. His face facing down could indicate the experience he\u2019s thinking about was terrible.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"635\" data-orig-height=\"387\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e968bc7db51d24e25aeeecb867f5a76b/tumblr_inline_pow60aWvzt1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"635\" data-orig-height=\"387\"></figure><p>Soon after that moment, Stephen gives Tony a pause and then returns to the topic, explaining how the Time Stone is important and talking more about the dangers Thanos is about to bring.

Now, Stephen knows he has to be more convincing so Tony will take him seriously, so he raises his chin more than before, showing Tony he\u2019s as \u201calpha\u201d as he is and that he is strong, serious and that he is good/competent as well, despite needing Tony\u2019s help.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"524\" data-orig-height=\"324\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b873de7f1ae4170f633e0d75225b633/tumblr_inline_pow5xhwnYl1uyhiqa_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"524\" data-orig-height=\"324\"></figure><p>So, did you like it?

Stephen&rsquo;s lips MOVED DOWN, meaning sadness as well, and FRUSTRATION. It makes total sense for Stephen to be sad, the first reason is: he needs Tony to cooperate, and second, he WANTS to be respected by Tony and at the moment, Tony is not respecting him or showing any kind of admiration. Someone normally expects respect EMOTIONALLY from someone when they ADMIRE that someone, in other words, Stephen didn&rsquo;t need to show SADNESS, he could just be angry, HOWEVER his lips indicate an expression of sadness, so Tony not respecting and even despising him makes him SAD. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78d8c6320ad2f4dfeceac1c0214722b0/tumblr_inline_pow5apGXI71uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Tony exposes his chest, raises his chin (it&rsquo;s a warning of dominance, he&rsquo;s responding against the act of being hit by the Cloak) and contracts one of the corners of his mouth, that normally means CONTEMPT, in other words, Tony didn&rsquo;t like being hit and he&rsquo;s thinking low of Stephen for doing so.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d346519d3ac37f9f36a7254e7fae7191/tumblr_inline_pow4xy4ri71uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>However, Tony isn&rsquo;t an irrational brat, so what does he do? He changes subject and starts talking about the Time Stone and how they should get rid of it. Tony OPENS his chest and STOPS STARING Stephen, meaning that Tony isn&rsquo;t focusing on his anger anymore. In other words, Stephen (or the Cloak :3) succeeded at getting Tony&rsquo;s attention and now Tony is inserted in the conversation talking about what he thinks. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15471b414472afffcfc0b045f2430bde/tumblr_inline_pow52ioI121uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Stephen, despite feeling a bit angry at first, now returned to his initial state, his eyebrows aren&rsquo;t tense and he&rsquo;s talking about the problem to Tony, looking directly at him. This means Stephen is giving priority to the danger Thanos is bringing while being open to Tony (showing trust) since his hands are not in front of his chest or lips. Stephen basically left what he was feeling aside and now his eyebrows returned to the initial tension.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95b1d9162eedb39c8fee395110aeda8b/tumblr_inline_pow56hQ3eI1uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>When Tony mentioned throwing the Time Stone away, Wong is clearly affected by it. His eyebrows contract a lot more than they were and he moves his body forward in disagreement. His lips contracted as well, but not laterally expanding it, but making his mouth sound &ldquo;shorter&rdquo;, that normally is an expression of anger. The idea the Time Stone could mean so little to Tony angers him, but he still has the same position as before, meaning he still trusts Tony and that he still is open to the conversation.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e409c493f0d18647e40949db051eef6a/tumblr_inline_pow5kwUsVE1uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Tony is super tense, so he starts talking about the ice cream and dairy subject, that has nothing to do with the serious conversation. Tony&rsquo;s eyebrows are strongly raised, his eyes also are a bit more open than the usual and his lips still are contracted, but externally: this is an expression of fear. Basically, Tony is anxious and scared and he&rsquo;s trying to calm down and tell himself all the situation is common and ordinary by inserting a silly ordinary fact in the middle of it. He&rsquo;s trying to calm himself. It might seem Tony is doing that just to disrespect Stephen and everyone in the room, however, he has a strong respect for Bruce, so no, Tony isn&rsquo;t doing that with the main objective of disrespecting anyone, even if his attitude is disrespectful, he&rsquo;s doing that trying to calm himself down.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67bb3137dbd22093209d126a72471164/tumblr_inline_pow5pparHa1uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Stephen lowers his head, normally, that means shame or when someone is facing or remembering about an unpleasant fact. At this point I believe Stephen NOTICED how tense Tony was, so what did he do? He joined Tony&rsquo;s game. The natural behavior we could expect was Stephen to say &ldquo;THIS IS SERIOUS! WHY ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT ICE CREAM??&rdquo; but Stephen knows why Tony is talking about ice cream, he&rsquo;s scared, trying to calm down, and Stephen is scared and tense as well, so he joins the game and starts talking about his own ice cream experience too.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/637f5f80c5144553b2270d5092bfc272/tumblr_inline_pow5w3q9Jk1uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Stephen congrats his lip to the upper side (easier to see if you watch that moment of the video), an expression of disgust. He&rsquo;s absolutely not disgusted of Tony, so what is he disgusted of? The ice cream he&rsquo;s talking about. Stephen indeed tried that ice cream (Wong&rsquo;s speech confirms that and suggests Stephen and Wong like going out trying many different ice cream flavors considering they even know the name of the many flavors!). We can conclude Stephen indeed tried Tony&rsquo;s ice cream and didn&rsquo;t like it, that means one of the two things: either Stephen is too picky or the Tony based ice cream was way too terrible. His face facing down could indicate the experience he&rsquo;s thinking about was terrible.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e968bc7db51d24e25aeeecb867f5a76b/tumblr_inline_pow60aWvzt1uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Soon after that moment, Stephen gives Tony a pause and then returns to the topic, explaining how the Time Stone is important and talking more about the dangers Thanos is about to bring. His forehead returned to the initial point of tension, meaning he isn&rsquo;t angry or sad anymore, he put his rational side into action and expects Tony to do the same. Now, Stephen knows he has to be more convincing so Tony will take him seriously, so he raises his chin more than before, showing Tony he&rsquo;s as &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; as he is and that he is strong, serious and that he is good/competent as well, despite needing Tony&rsquo;s help.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3b873de7f1ae4170f633e0d75225b633/tumblr_inline_pow5xhwnYl1uyhiqa_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>So, did you like it?
