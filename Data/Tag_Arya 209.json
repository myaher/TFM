                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>\n&hellip; legitimized bastard. Could this be a good sign for Arya/Gendry in \nthe future? I thought there were too many similarities to not point them\n out.\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\nOh, and they also use their mothers&rsquo; names in homage to them (Arya for \nherself in the HoB&amp;W, Baela for her daughter) and are intent on \nkilling for vengeance (Arya has a list but still needs to follow through\n with it and Baela probably had grandma Rhaenys in mind when she \nattacked Aegon II).\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>Yes, the parallels here are very strong. Very easy to see Arya in Baela, although Baela does have her differences as well. (Very different family situation especially re the personalities of her parents, the whole Targ thing and all; and Baela, though older, is also more innocent than Arya as she doesn&rsquo;t have her trauma or child soldier tropes.) But the way Baela and Rhaena are with the regency of their half-brother Aegon III, I can totally see that with Arya and Sansa and Rickon (or Bran if one prefers).<br /></p><p>Regarding Arya/Gendry, Baela/Alyn <i>could</i> be a good sign? Although GRRM says that their marriage was &ldquo;stormy&rdquo;, which is a tad worrisome&hellip; but also things like &ldquo;yet in the end they reconciled, as they always did.&rdquo; Which is nice. :)&nbsp; I would prefer to have details from F&amp;B volume 2 before I was definite about it all, though. (Like, the varying accounts as to whether Alyn slept with Aliandra Martell are one thing, we still have the big question about his affair with Elaena Targaryen. Though <a href=\"http://nobodysuspectsthebutterfly.tumblr.com/post/164022191438/kind-of-going-off-that-bastard-ask-you-received\">I still strongly suspect it happened after Baela died</a>, sigh.)</p><p>Nevertheless, Alyn being legitimized and made the heir to Driftmark is a point in favor of that plotpoint happening with Gendry and Storm&rsquo;s End somehow. (Even if Edric Storm is the bastard of Robert far more likely to be preferred by the stormlords, being highborn on both sides, god knows if GRRM might do something terrible to him before that could come about.) But even Gendry being legitimized at all (with no Storm&rsquo;s End) could be a big bonus for his potential relationship with Arya, whether she would care (she wouldn&rsquo;t) or not (he would).</p><p>Either way&hellip; sigh, this is why I really wish F&amp;B was a POV-based narrative, not a history book. I look forward to seeing what ficcers do with the parallels here, though, and of course to whatever GRRM eventually does. :)</p></p>",
