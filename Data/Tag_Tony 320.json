You snicker and Peter crossed his arms, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a good guy now, dont worry, now lets dance.&rdquo;.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p><p>Stephen laughed as he entertained Most of the Avengers at the bar, Christine under his arm he kept his spirit up by drinking a bit more then usaul, &ldquo;Now Bruce, I have to disagree, if you wanna hear a crazy story let me tell you about my tuesdays when I do my weekly cleanse of all the evil creatures that flood new york,&rdquo; Stephen stopped boasting when he overheard Thor rejoicing about something,</p><p>Tony was the first to look over and see the commotion, he sighed rolling his eyes and face palming,</p><p>&ldquo;This is just great, Strange, why don&rsquo;t we go to the balcony you can tell me all about your tuesdays up there,&rdquo; Stephen ignored him taking his arm off Christine,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; Stephen said moving through the crowd circling the bar.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you she be happy to see you!!&rdquo; Thor forcefully patted Loki&rsquo;s back, Loki flinched a bit feeling Thor&rsquo;s smack,</p><p>&ldquo;Yes well I really need to swoon her, after what I did Im surprised all she did was slap me,&rdquo; Loki leaned on the bar table sipping his old fashioned,</p><p>&ldquo;Oh water under the rainbow bridge,&ldquo; Thor waved his hand, \"Im telling you she fancies you, I haven&rsquo;t seen her with anyone else, besides Professor Strange, and thats clearly nothing,&rdquo;</p><p>Loki felt a presence behind him,</p><p>&ldquo;Loki,&rdquo; Stephen called to him with a glare, Loki took a drink of his drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening Doctor,&ldquo; Loki grinned raising his glass, \"congratulations by the way, this is quite a spectacle,&rdquo;</p><p>Strange crossed his arms unamused,</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, funny, I didn&rsquo;t see you on the list,&rdquo;</p><p>Thor interrupts,</p><p>&ldquo;Deepest apologies, Strange Doctor,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doctor Strange,&rdquo; Strange corrected him,</p><p>&ldquo;Right that&rsquo;s what I said, anyway I snuck him in, he has quite an important engagement to tend too with a certain Maiden here at this party,&rdquo;</p><p>Strange shook his head sternly,</p><p>&ldquo;Not happening,&rdquo;</p><p>Thor raised a brow before he could protest Loki placed a hand on his shoulder,</p><p>&ldquo;Its ok Brother, I can handle this in a friendly manner,&rdquo;</p><p>Thor gave his brother a concerned look, Loki nodded to Thor and Thor smiled to Doctor Strange,</p><p>&ldquo;I think I may have lost my date, Gentlemen\" Thor left to find Jane and give Loki privacy.</p><p>Loki leered at Strange as if he was unworthy of his presence,</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why your so upset, you looked pretty familiar with that other Mortal,&rdquo; Loki said casually sipping his drink,</p><p>Strange looked to Loki through narrow eyes,</p><p>&ldquo;Cut the bullshit Laufeyson,&rdquo;</p><p>Loki grinned his teeth in anger closing the gap between them with hate festering in his eyes,</p><p>&ldquo;Odinson,&ldquo; Loki corrected him, \"you very well know I&rsquo;m of Odinson you damned-&rdquo;, Loki closed his eyes breathed through his nose and exhaled out of his mouth to calm himself down,</p><p>&ldquo;I know your only trying to make an ass out of me,&rdquo; Loki said trying to relax,</p><p>Strange hid his smirk obviously enjoying how easy it was to get under his skin.</p><p>Loki finished his drink leaving the glass at the bar,</p><p>&ldquo;Well as fun as this conversation is, I must return to my evening&rdquo;</p><p>Loki tried to walk past Strange but he still blocked his way,</p><p>&ldquo;No way in hell will I let you get close to her,&rdquo; Stephen fumed,</p><p>&ldquo;To who?&rdquo; Loki asked acting confused, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not after your boring Doctor, Or were you speaking of someone else?&rdquo;</p><p>Strange scoffed unsure if its the jealousy or the alchol speaking,</p><p>&ldquo;(y/n), will never betray me,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Betray!?&rdquo;

You looked to him taking the wine, siping it and placing it on the coffee table before walking into his bedroom.</p><p>Loki felt a little nervous to follow, but he did just took a minute to move, he found you laying on his bed, hesitantly he took off his jacket.</p><p>&ldquo;Whats wrong?&rdquo; You asked concerned, &ldquo;You usually are a lot more confident&rdquo;</p><p>Loki took off his shoes and unbuttoned his vest frowning,</p><p>&ldquo;Yes well that was before,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Before?&rdquo; you repeated his words in confusion,</p><p>Loki sighed sitting next to you on the bed holding your bandaged hands,&ldquo;I fear if I touch you, something horrid will come your way, I am always burning keep this up, and you will be singed.&rdquo;.</p><p>You move your hands away from his and look to his face,</p><p>&ldquo;I can not be burned, well unless your an infinity stone and I thought you were burdened with glorious purpose?&rdquo; Loki smiled faintly still sitting on the edge looking to his earth socks.</p><p>You placed a hand on his thigh causing him to look at you that&rsquo;s when you kissed him, kissed him with the passion of a thousand suns.</p><p>Loki closed his eyes and kissed you back his right hand on your face deepening the kiss, you swung a leg over to straddle his lap, Loki wrapped his arms around your back keeping you from falling.</p><p>Loki stopped kissing you,</p><p>\"I can&rsquo;t I dont want to hurt you,&rdquo; Loki explained.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if you noticed but I&rsquo;m a tough bitch,&ldquo; you spoke with attitude, \"don&rsquo;t look to my wounds as, well, wounds, look to them as achievements, battle scars to my accomplishments, a lot has changed since you been gone, I can hold my own,&rdquo; you said tilting your head.</p><p>Loki smiled warmly,</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose in my eyes your something I wish to keep safe, to keep from battle scars\" he said raising his eyebrows.</p><p>You get off his lap to stand in front of him, you undo your dress letting it slide off you and fall to the floor revealing your lacy sexy panties, garter and bra.</p><p>Loki gazed at your body as if it was all he desired, you got back to him, unbuttoning his dress shirt and slipped it off his shoulders, your eyes widened as you looked to his upper body,</p><p>&ldquo;Hooooollllllyyyy Conollliii&rdquo; you gasped which startled him.</p><p>&ldquo;What, what am I blue?!&rdquo; he felt his forehead for horns,</p><p>&ldquo;What? no,&ldquo; you snort, \"Your fucken cut, I mean damn what is your routine?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but can we refrain from the earth lingo, It&rsquo;s quite perplexing&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, right i&rsquo;m sorry your just unbelievably hot&rdquo;.</p><p>Trying to get back into character but feeling the grooves of his abs caused you to hard core lust, he even had the V thing. Not able to contain yourself you lean into his lips, his hands passionately held your face it felt so right you wanted to keep going.</p><p>You slid your hands down to his lap caressing his bulge causing it to grow in his pants, you unbutton his pants and slid your hand down under the elastic of his boxers and there it was, his huge girthy cock in your right hand.</p><p>Loki let out a slight exhale from your advance, he felt you wrap a hand around his size and got nervous, &ldquo;Your bandages&rdquo; he reminded you,</p><p>you pull your hand out,</p><p>&ldquo;Damn that&rsquo;s right, well they say the best way to give a hand job is with your mouth.&rdquo; you shrug before kissing him.</p><p>You kiss him exactly how you wanted to kiss his dick, swirling your tongue around his, he gave you control, for once in his life he wasn&rsquo;t the one steering he was the one in the passenger seat. You part from his lips, and got to your knees to tug off his pants and boxer briefs once off his dick sprung up and nearly smacked you in the face.</p><p>You lock eyes with him,</p><p>&ldquo;Can you hold it steady?&ldquo;</p><p>Loki nodded holding the base, you then slide your tongue from the bottom of the shaft to the tip of the head, hearing Loki react really turned you on.</p><p>Taking off your bra throwing it to the side, You lube up his cock with your mouth and spit down your chest before rubbing all your saliva around to make the gap between your flaumptious titts nice and slippery, you then held each breast in a hand and stroked his cock between them as you locked eyes with him seeing him thoroughly enjoying it.</p><p>&ldquo;Never in the nine realms have I seen this before,&rdquo; you tried not to laugh as you spoke seductively,</p><p>&ldquo;I watch a lot of porn&rdquo;.</p><p>You kept sliding your tits up and down on his throbbing cock getting him to moan up at the ceiling, his face was flushed watching you please him.</p><p>Once you felt he was all lubed up you got off your knees and slid off your panties, hands to his chest you push him down on the bed as you climbed on top him. Loki slid his hand under you to position his cock right below your pusy, wiggling it on your slit.</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to sit on this dick?&rdquo; you asked seductively.</p><p>Loki gave you a lustful grin,</p><p>&ldquo;You know I would, you mortals and your teasing, Perhaps that&rsquo;s why we get along so well&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly lowering your pussy you quickly inhale, feeling his length and girth stuff every inch of your walls, stuck with your mouth open as a repressed moan slips out,</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&ldquo; you rasped as your body stiffened trying to accept his size, Loki loved watching you in conflict.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he gripped your hips forcing you to gyrate on top of him, &ldquo;Be a good girl and Straddle my cock!&rdquo;</p><p>You may be the one on top but Loki definitely regained control, the blood rushed to your head as your brain fogged, it was as if he was fucking the saine out of you. Not wanting to submit too early you take back control by bouncing on top of his dick twerking your ass slipping his cock in and out, in and out of your soaking wet pussy.</p><p>His hands release your hips and run up your chest, cupping your breasts squeezing them slapping them into each other and pinching your nipples. You run your fingers through your hair as your eyes shut tight when Loki arched his back and thrusted his pelvis up to shove himself deeper inside you, twisting his hips side to side rubbing himself against your clit and slithering his cock even deeper.</p><p>Your head immediately jerked up to the ceiling feeling the tip of his dick hit the back of your vaginal wall. Your body quivers and pants as you begged,</p><p>&ldquo;Keep fucking me! Don&rsquo;t stop, just like that, oh yes, just like that.&rdquo;.</p><p>Before you knew it you lost all control of your body you never wanted to stop riding him, without realizing it your calling out his name with every good thrust he gave you.</p><p>&ldquo;You enjoying my cock Darling?&rdquo; Loki asked animalistically as he pulled your hips down harder into him.</p><p>You gasp and whine, &ldquo;Yes, LOKi! YES!&ldquo;</p><p>Hearing your sexual thrill he sat up, grabbing your ass and lifting you of the bed, the way he lifts you so effortlessly to press your back against the wall made you feel so cute and weightless.</p><p>Loki kissed your neck roughly then your lips, he thrusted his giant dick deeper and deeper harder and harder inside you, your legs bucked from the gyration of his hips, you dug your nails in his back feeling your orgasm approaching, &ldquo;Im gonna cum! Im gonna cum!&ldquo; you cried.</p><p>Hearing you say that gave Loki the motive to drill you faster,</p><p>&ldquo;Oh gaawwwwd, oh fuuuuck!&rdquo; your heart raced as you got closer and closer to peaking, suddenly your body screams with pleasure, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cumming, I&rsquo;m cumming!&rdquo; you cried out breathing fast as your eyes fogged white and everything in the room began to hover,</p><p>Your body tingled and shook you let out loud long shuttered moans as your brain hazed and your mouth slacked open practically drooling as Loki filled you up with his Royal cum, brain dead from over stimulation your body went limp, everything in the room crashed to the floor breaking glass and spilling wine. Loki let you down gently on the bed, his cum dripping out of you.</p><p>You try to look to him but your eyes kept fluttering,</p><p>&ldquo;Thank God for birth control,&rdquo; you breath,</p><p>Loki&rsquo;s eyes looked to the ceiling as he thanks the birth control god.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV5kFzjIZUkiuJbkXNdMyTQ\">@lokissidehoe</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4BMTJRvYSCpkm1VsisrBsw\">@gotta-get-back-to-johnlock</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIJl607nMBKBvHkJW7zhAdw\">@naniky</a></p><p>@tatums-a-penguin</p><p>Let Me Know If You Wanna Be Tagged For Future Chapters :)</p>",
