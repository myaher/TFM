(Y/N)!\u201d Tony called out, his voice straining from the tightness of his throat, blood and tears mixing on his wounded skin, but he needed to find her. It was a gnawing urge that forced his buried panic to resurface like a weight on his chest. Once more, he let his person slip between his fingertips, and once again he realized that no one could hate him as much as he hated himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Strange cut in, but Tony was inconsolable, himself beginning to search further inside Ebony Maw\u2019s\u00a0ship, the creatures dead body still lying where (Y/N) had stabbed him.\u00a0\u201cStark, there\u2019s no use. She\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t lose her! Not again. (Y/N)!\u201d Tony countered, trying to convince himself more than Strange, but he knew at this moment that he had lost it. Tony continued to pace, calling out her name until Peter stepped in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMr. Stark, we\u2026we haven\u2019t lost her, yet,\u201d Peter coaxed quietly, making Tony lock his jaw.\u00a0\u201cYou know (Y/N). If anything, I\u2019d be nervous for Thanos. I\u2019m not really happy about it, but doing what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t really helping either\u2026sir.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat? Screaming her name into the void isn\u2019t helping?\u201d Tony joked back, his heart not really in it, but understood Peter\u2019s point\u00a0as he patted him on the shoulder.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re on the right track, kid\u2026she was right about you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTouching moment, you two,\u201d Strange interjected impatiently, seeing as to how Tony\u2019s panic attack had now passed\u2026mostly. \u201cBut finding her isn\u2019t the priority now. If it really is Thanos who has her, then I\u2019m sure wherever he is, she\u2019ll be. Titan is still our best option.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDid you lose your emotions during a wizarding accident, or something?\u201d Tony accused, but Strange ignored his jab, instead watching the oncoming planet that their ship was headed straight towards, the impact imminent.</p><p>\u00a0 Walking by Tony, Peter made one last comment.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) has never given up on anything. We shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d Peter proposed as he made his way towards the helm of the ship. Tony, in that moment, had never been more proud of Peter. The kid still had so much potential. So much.</p><p>\u00a0 But reality hit him straight in the face when he witnessed the barren wasteland they were about to crash into. With any luck, wherever (Y/N) was, it was better than dealing with this shit.</p><hr><p>READER\u2019S\u00a0POV</p><p>\u00a0 Maybe, (Y/N) had finally lost her mind. Maybe, today should be the day that she gives in to her psychosis. To be free of reality, and live by the flow that life leads for her to follow, taking it one bare, naked footstep through the flower field at a time. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? To just let go. Wouldn\u2019t that just be the dream? A lustful, 1970\u2032s\u00a0Stevie Nicks, acid-tripping, peaceful-protesting, flower-powering fantasy? <i>Fantasy</i> being the key word.</p><p>\u00a0 The colors faded in and out of focus, melding together in powdered smoke that rose deep inside her mind\u2019s eye. The closer she reached to consciousness, the more violent the colors became. The more the dust became the fire shot from a gun, bullets piercing her brain with each flash of hair-raising vibrancy. A shock. A bang. An explosion. A chaotic warfare forcing a battering ram into the doors of her psyche that were locked tight around the barriers of her awareness, but the wood was splintering and the fires were igniting. They were burning red hot into a lick of yellow, transforming into the spindly fingers of a wicked green, contorting into a ball of raging blue that scorched her into consciousness with a sharp yelp that evaporated into the humid air.</p><p>\u00a0 Deep inhales were all her body could manage as a cold sweat trickled down her spine to overcompensate the burning sensation that continued to blister her skin. The abrupt awakening sparked her eyes with a newfound urgency and arrow-point accuracy as they searched the dark, damp cavern that she found herself in, the view beyond the metal beams that trapped her as ancient as time itself. The best way to describe her predicament would be to say that she was a bird trapped in a cage, feeling the weight of herself and the chair she was strapped to not firm on solid ground, but rather levitating by the fiery blue energy that had shocked her from her dream, it\u2019s poisonous tendrils wrapping themselves around her bare toes that prickled with sleep. The faint drips of something liquid and the far-off echoes of bangs of the inner-working of a metallic ship caught her attention as she felt another person\u2019s presence suck the air from her lungs.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Not knowing the entity would yet to cease her tounge.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI hope you have more than some handcuffs and a few metal bars to intimidate me, becuase if you think this is the first time I\u2019ve been in this situation, then you don\u2019t realize how kinky I can really get,\u201d (Y/N) panted out more confidently than her body could manage, just barely lifting up her head enough to see through the wild hair that mangled her vision, hoping to size up her captor.\u00a0\u201cHonestly, hit me with your best shot. I\u2019m looking for the full production. Entertainment at it\u2019s fucking finest.\u00a0Really inspire me here. I\u2019m asking for torture creativity\u2026\u201d she ranted until she finally caught sight of her captor through the shadows, his figure looming ominously just beyond the edge of the water-filled chasm she was perched above, and wow. She was not ready.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour petulance astounds me, child. You\u2019re much more brazen than even I had anticipated through my years of watching you grow,\u201d her captor announced, his massive body somehow more intense than even Hulk to match. But what really caught her attention (besides the thing that was growing on his chin that she soon realized was just his chin) was his voice. The voice from her dream.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>Thanos</i>. And as much as she hated to admit it, the name and recognition of his identity alone dropped her heart into the pit of her stomach with a dull thud. It wasn\u2019t just his size, but the way he stood and commanded the room. There was no trace of doubt. He knew what he wanted and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he wouldn\u2019t do to get it. Years of patience had brought him this far, and he had finally decided that he had mastered his craft. It was less from his words that she perceived this, but from his eyes that were more than dark, but focused. Focused on one path, and one alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 It was one he shared with her own father.</p><p>\u00a0 But she recovered quickly, dragging her eyes like claws in the dirt to focus on his, despite the guttural instinct inside of her that screamed at her ragdoll limbs to tuck themselves into a ball and hide. But that instinct was buried with the rest of her fear, locked tight inside a box next to the other box that, apparently, held her will to live.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more purple than I thought you would be,\u201d (Y/N) responded apathetically. \u201cGuess, we both got an unwelcomed surprise today.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI disagree,\u201d Thanos countered patiently.\u00a0\u201cYou are enthusiasically welcomed on my ship. More welcome than possibly anyone here, in fact. My hope lies in your willingness to give great thought and action to what I am told the late Ebony has evoked upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHow \u2018bout, instead, I give you a fresh basket of <i>go fuck yourself</i>, and we both go off on our happy, merry ways. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, she was jerked forward, gripping the edges of her chair with her chipped nails as the cage hovered towards Thanos, his fist balled in a golden, Hamburger Helper glove that willed her to him. Regaining her composure, she held Thanos\u2019 glare, matching his intensity as she neared his unusually scarred and cratered face that reminded her of a Grand Canyon on an alien planet that nobody would ever want to visit.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t forget that you\u2019re the one in the cage,\u201d Thanos threatened as the tendrils wrapped around her ankles, but she kicked them off with a scoff.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAll the more reason to prove that you\u2019re terrified of me,\u201d she purred through a smirk as she watched Thanos\u2019 frown deepen.\u00a0\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t think you can control me otherwise? Becuase on this one thing, you\u2019d be right\u2026but just so we\u2019re clear, everything else you\u2019re preaching is a complete bust and, ultimately going to fail. It didn\u2019t work for Hitler, so what makes you so special?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPetty how you only see the Universe through the lens of your own planet and it\u2019s many\u00a0downfalls when there are so many beings, too many beings, for you to even comprehend.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, good morning, Mr. High and Mighty. Maybe, I should introduce you to Humility sometime. Guess since you\u2019re deep-fisting a few Infinity Stones, you now think you have all the answers then, don\u2019t you? This just in, buddy,\u201d (Y/N) dared, the fear creeping into her throat, but she shoved it back down, focusing on her words rather than her emotions as she tugged at the Power Stone that, surprisingly, still hung around her neck.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got one too. Which begs the question: why? You\u2019ve got me locked in this cage <i>with</i> the stone, instead of dead and without it. You say you\u2019ve got this master plan, but so far, I\u2019m not putting the pieces together here, so maybe\u2026\u201d (Y/N) paused her rant for a moment, closing her eyes to take a breath to calm herself down, a plan of her own hatching in her brain that wasn\u2019t her typical style, but a means to an end\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes flickered up to Thanos\u2019s once more, her head cocked to the side in question which peeked his interest.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo on,\u201d Thanos prodded.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut maybe because I haven\u2019t gotten the full story, yet,\u201d she wondered aloud.\u00a0\u201cAll I\u2019ve heard about you sounds straight out of a legend from the mouths of people you\u2019d either just threatened, or hired. Maybe I haven\u2019t heard your side of the story yet and since you\u2019ve so stupidly allowed me to live this long, I take it you probably want to share it with me. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cVery intuitive,\u201d Thanos grinned as he took a seat on his throne, waving the chains away from (Y/N)\u2019s wrists and ankles, allowing her the opportunity to lounge in her own chair\u00a0that felt like a broken lawn chair in comparison to his, but she never wavered in her confidence.\u00a0\u201cBut I must ask: what changed your mind so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Thanos drawled as he began to relax, taking note of his prisoner\u2019s false face that she wore, so familiar to the one his daughter had worn in the years before her betrayal. The one that had led to her being knocked out at the foot of his throne while he took the opportuity to interrogate his new and improved right-hand in peace.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBefore we start your therapy session, maybe we talk about the poor soul you have sniffing your toes first?\u201d (Y/N) asked, her empathy well-masked, yet unmistakable to Thanos which made his mouth twitch into a tight-lipped grin.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll get to her,\u201d he mused, making (Y/N) lift an eyebrow and hold her hands up defensively, motioning for him to begin.\u00a0\u201cGrowing up, my home planet of Titan was constantly on the brink of collapse from famine, disease, and war. Every day was a struggle. It was in that time watching my people starve that I came up with the idea to balance the population. To kill half of the people in order for my planet to flourish in their wake. Random, of course. The rich, the poor, and whoever in between. Chaos into balance. All for the rest of my planet to become happy and healthy for centuries to come. To finally be able to live.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, you know what they say about chaos?\u201d (Y/N) sighed, quoting Heath Ledger\u2019s, the Joker.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI had a feeling that you were right for the job,\u201d Thanos smiled in approval, making (Y/N) smile to herself.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d (Y/N) mused, wondering if she should point out Thanos\u2019s connection to, in her opinion, one of the greatest villains of all-time, but thought better of it in order to keep up with her plan to keep the peace.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos watched her face carefully, but she remained neutral, only nodding after her comment as she waited for him to continue.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cSo desperately did they crave salvation, a solution to their inevitable demise, yet when I offered them one\u2026\u201d Thanos recalled darkly, shaking his head in disapproval,\u00a0\u201cthey called me a Madman. And once my planet turned to ruins, I knew that I had been right. And now, here we are. So many planets so close to extinction, so many people suffering when the solution is right here with me. I refuse to allow another waste of a civilization.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut if your problem is a starving population, why not use the stones to provide a meal a day to those who need it? Snap, and there\u2019s a Thanksgiving dinner for half the world sitting on their table.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut genocide is?\u201d (Y/N) countered, but quickly realized his mind had been set for decades. His expression was immovable, so (Y/N) changed her tone.\u00a0\u201cHow are you so sure that this would work?\u201d (Y/N) asked calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t my first time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 That shocked (Y/N), and there was no way that she could hide it. She suddenly got a glimpse of the slaughtering of millions, blood, gore, and death. Bodies stacked upon bodies. Something out of Chainsaw Massacre. Something like she had experienced in Hydra. How has he not been stopped, yet? Or, at least, had she never heard of him before? This seems like a major issue that should have been addressed ages ago.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSurprised? So was she,\u201d Thanos grinned, gazing down at the woman on the ground beneath him, her jade-hued fingers beginning to twitch. He cocked his head to the side.\u00a0\u201cMaybe she should be the one to tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Closing his fist, a flash of blue light erupted from his glove as the woman\u2019s eyes shot open in a panic, herself standing up to address her attacker as she drew her sword. Her hyperventilation filled the room until her eyes landed on Thanos, her hatred pure and unforgiving as she started towards him only to have her weapon dissipate in a flurry of bubbles just as it reached Thanos\u2019s neck. The woman flew backwards to land on the ground in front of (Y/N)\u2019s cage, hitting her head against the bars that had finally landed on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Had to admit, (Y/N) was impressed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou brought me back here?\u201d She snarled at Thanos as she stood.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere else would I take you, Daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDaughter?\u201d (Y/N) choked out. Both Thanos and his, apparently, daughter turned on her.\u00a0\u201cSorry, you just don\u2019t really seem like the, uh\u2026fatherly type.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHardly. And he\u2019s not my father,\u201d the woman growled back at Thanos.\u00a0\u201cSo,\u00a0now you have a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not a prisoner,\u201d Thanos explained casually.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean, I kind of feel like a prisoner,\u201d (Y/N) shrugged as she tapped the bars with her fingernails.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOnly until I have your full cooperation, Little One,\u201d Thanos mused, his lips pulling into a sneer as his daughter tensed. She hung her head low, avoiding his eye contact, but the guilt and self-loathing was clear in her face. (Y/N) wasn\u2019t sure why, but this seemed like a very personal blow from Thanos.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo this is why you took her? To replace me?\u201d The woman accused, narrowing her eyes at Thanos who still had his lips curled.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHardly,\u201d he responded coldly, echoing his daughter\u2019s words.\u00a0\u201cShe is much more powerful than even you were, and the only one that will be able to retrieve the Infinity Stone that I need. Something you were unable to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 This grabbed his daughter\u2019s attention, her eyes finally meeting his as he towered directly over her.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I disappointed you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos let out another disapproving sigh as he leaned closer to her.\u00a0\u201cI am disappointed,\u201d he stated, taking a strand of her wavy red hair.\u00a0\u201cAnd not becuase you didn\u2019t find it, but because you did. And you lied.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The tension hung in the air as they both sized each other up, Thanos not wanting to hurt his daughter, and her probably wanting to hurt him, but knowing that she couldn\u2019t. (Y/N) finally decided to step in.\u00a0\u201cUh, not that I\u2019m not fully entertained by your family drama and wouldn\u2019t invest in a Keeping Up With the Infinity Stones, but\u2026this seems like a very personal matter. Should I\u2026maybe step out, or\u2026? Becuase it seems like you two have some things to work out here-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d the woman insisted.\u00a0\u201cI know exactly where I stand.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, Gamora,\u201d Thanos sighed.\u00a0\u201cHow you continue to disappoint me. But my question is, would you dare to disappoint your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a sister, too?\u201d (Y/N) exclaimed, Thanos and Gamora glared at her again.\u00a0\u201cLike I said, should I step outside?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Thanos denied, focusing his attention on (Y/N) now which she suddenly regretted as Thanos began to encircle her like a shark sniffing out his next meal.\u00a0\u201cBut what I do want is for you to give me your final thoughts on the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) let out a laugh, leaning back in her chair again.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I would if you told me exactly what you wanted me to do in this whole <i>plan </i>of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Gamora\u2019s face cringed in disgust at (Y/N)\u2019s words, confused as to why this random girl would even consider his cruelty. Who the hell was she?</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d Thanos smiled as he turned his back on her to return to his throne, beginning his explanation as he walked. In those seconds, (Y/N) gained Gamora\u2019s attention and mouthed, <i>we have to work together</i>, widening her eyes hoping that Gamora understood. At first, Gamora seemed to distrust (Y/N), but quickly realized that the girl was in a cage, so Thanos obviously didn\u2019t trust her. Which made her the perfect ally.\u00a0\u201cAs I mentioned before, I have watched you grow from afar. Ever since you came in contact with the Orb, my interest in you has grown. You\u2019ve been through so much, child, seen so much. You have witnessed the worst of humanity, the places in which resources are limited and want is plentiful, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d (Y/N) responded, letting the emotions of what she had experienced during her days on the streets consume her. Look, if she wanted Thanos to trust her, she really had to sell it.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is one reason why I have chosen you. I think that you, of all people, will understand my vision. The assistance that may be offered to those in need.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd the other reason you chose me?\u201d (Y/N) prodded, ignoring his failed logic.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour connection with the Vision.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, you already said that,\u201d (Y/N) contended after a moment, making Thanos frown. And that was not a pretty sight.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, child. <i>The</i> Vision. The keeper of the Mind Stone,\u201d Thanos explained further as (Y/N) did an awkward, <i>ohhhhh, right, </i>taking full responsibility of her own failed logic.\u00a0\u201cYes, you know him well.\u201d (Y/N) cocked her head to the side.\u00a0\u201cWell enough, then,\u201d Thanos corrected.\u00a0\u201cWhat I need from you is to take the stone from him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze. No more jokes. This got much more serious in an instant. Yes, aiding Thanos in any way would be disgusting and wrong, but to actually be the one to, not only <i>take</i> the stone, but to be the one to take Vision\u2019s life? To kill the only person, besides maybe herself, that has come anywhere close to the relationship that Wanda had with her brother? Yeah, no. She had to get the fuck out of there, pronto.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) scoffed, still maintaining her neutrality.\u00a0\u201cSo, you think that becuase I\u2019m friends with Vision, that that would make it easier to assassinate him?\u201d (Y/N) questioned.\u00a0\u201cYeah, that makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA small price to pay,\u201d Thanos proclaimed as (Y/N) made a face.\u00a0\u201cYour relationship will allow you to get close to him and take the stone before he can defend himself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo betray his trust?\u201d (Y/N) broke in.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNow you understand,\u201d Thanos smiled (didn\u2019t think anything could be worse than the frowing, but she was wrong). (Y/N) shook her head, completely miffed by this dude\u2019s departure from sanity and lack of humanity. She was right. There wasn\u2019t anything that he wouldn\u2019t do, and no biting comment she would make was going to change that. Acceptance, whether it was real or not, would be her only way out.\u00a0\u201cAll you need to do is give me the Mind Stone, then this can all be over as soon as it started. Then, the Universe can truly begin to renew itself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis <i>has</i> gone by insanely quick,\u201d (Y/N) whispered in awe (that wasn\u2019t entirely disingenuous), thinking that just a few hours ago she was back on Earth watching pigeons cage match over some road-kill hot dog from the window of a wizard\u2019s lair. She looked up to Thanos.\u00a0\u201cYou really do believe in this?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow could you even think of doing this?\u201d Gamora yelled at her, charging her cell.\u00a0\u201cI know that I don\u2019t know you, but this can\u2019t be something that you want! The pain and suffering that my planet felt after he came and destroyed it remains. Yes, there may be more resources to go around, but we will never forgive what we lost or forget who we lost. Never.\u201d By the end, Gamora had tears streaming down her cheeks, anger boiling over. Her pain was tangible, squeezing (Y/N)\u2019s own stomach at the thought of her own friends and family\u2026</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut this is just one generation,\u201d (Y/N) argued back, leaving Gamora speechless and bringing Thanos to lean closer in anticipation to her next words, his elbows resting on his knees.\u00a0\u201cOnce this generation has passed, and those who had to deal with the agony have come and gone, all you have left is the good that has come out of your father\u2019s plan. I\u2019m sure, whether you know it or not, some people now have already found gratefulness in what he\u2019s done\u2026and I think that I would be among them,\u201d (Y/N) concluded thoughtfully, throwing a knowing look to Thanos who studied her closely.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose everything,\u201d Gamora swore, and that\u2019s where (Y/N) let out a dark laugh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLosing loved ones is old news for me,\u201d (Y/N) dismissed.\u00a0\u201cOnce you get through the hurricane, there\u2019s always a way come back from the destruction. I watched my entire family die right in front of me, and I\u2019m still here. In fact, I\u2019ve made a new one of my own, and I can do it again.\u00a0If I can make it so others can live a life better than mine, I\u2019m all in.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 And in that moment, her cage dissolved in an array of shiny bubbles that reflected the shock in both (Y/N)\u2019s and Gamora\u2019s expressions. Thanos barely lifted a finger, his arms still resting on his throne that were carved in what resembled crocodile skin. Fitting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFinally\u2026a worthy ally. Welcome to the Black Order, (Y/N), my newfound pride and glory,\u201d Thanos announced as (Y/N) did an awkward curtsy thing that she didn\u2019t even understand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, really, but uh,\u00a0I hope I can first ask\u2026\u201d (Y/N) began, putting a slight shake into her voice which seemed to please Thanos greatly as he smiled down to her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course you may,\u201d Thanos allowed as (Y/N) nodded with a shy smile.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere exactly are we?\u201d (Y/N) asked, suppressing a laugh when she heard Gamora grumble about her\u00a0\u2018own personal hellscape.\u2019\u00a0\u201cMaybe near somewhere that I know like Sakaar, or Xandar, or\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cXandar has already been destroyed,\u201d Thanos interrupted, a bragging tone entering his voice as (Y/N)\u2019s own faltered with a small,<i> oh</i>.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about them. Their planet was doomed from the very beginning. Have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cNo, I uh\u2026I\u2019ve just heard stories.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cIf you had been, I promise that you would have seen it\u2019s uselessness. However,\u00a0I found fragments of the Orb there,\u201d Thanos explained, revealing one of the sockets on his glove to be halfway filled with a piece of amethyst light,\u00a0\u201cbut once I discovered the rest of the stone\u2019s\u00a0transfer to Asgard, I knew, not only of Xandar\u2019s time to be decimated, but that\u00a0Loki would be the perfect option to reunite you with the stone. Why you ever decided to part ways with it to begin with, I shall never fully understand. You were one of the fiercest warriors I had ever seen. I suppose now I shall make you so once more.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLoki? How did you\u2026?\u201d (Y/N) questioned (ignoring his comment about \u2018once\u2019 being the fiercest, since she was still the fiercest, so fuck him) as she slowly put the pieces together.\u00a0\u201cNew York. You were already in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s quite persistent when he wants to be,\u201d Thanos complimented.\u00a0\u201cBut his lack of conviction is repulsive. His use had quickly worn thin.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHad?\u201d (Y/N) choked out, her voice so small from the tightness that grew inside her throat.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you cared for him? After his attempt to take control of your planet?\u201d Thanos chided her which just\u2026she had to swallow down,\u00a0\u2018<i>then what the hell are you doing?</i>\u2019 And\u00a0\u2018<i>but you were the one who sent him to Earth</i>,\u2019 to instead take a moment to gather more intel about her surroundings. She found a few ways to escape, but only one really stood out to her.\u00a0\u201cBut returning to your primary question, we are just outside of Knowhere. Pitiful place, alas it is where I found, not only the Reality Stone, but my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd she\u2019s ever so grateful,\u201d Gamora murmured coldly with her arms crossed over her chest. She was more like (Y/N) than she could even know. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDaughter, you continue to forget your once shared loyalty to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat was before I knew I had a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you chose wrong,\u201d Thanos growled as he leaned towards Gamora again.\u00a0\u201cWhere is the Soul Stone?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gamora demanded, gritting her teeth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, come on,\u201d (Y/N) scoffed, rolling her eyes which surprised both Gamora and Thanos.\u00a0\u201cI mean, he\u2019s going to get it out of you, so just bite the bullet on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Gamora shot back, making (Y/N) sigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not as good an actress as you think, and he\u2019s got two and a half Infinity Stones while you have none. It\u2019s common sense, really.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou heard her,\u201d Thanos rumbled, throwing an appreciatory glance at (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cOut with it, Gamora. If not, you know that I have other methods of making you talk. And I wouldn\u2019t want to have to crush you when all you have to do is give me a name.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, there was a small burst of giggling that floated in the air. Thanos wrinkled up his face as he found the source in (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d he demanded at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d (Y/N) sighed, waving him off.\u00a0\u201cI guess it\u2019s just funny because\u2026I was thinking the same thing,\u201d she finished with a smirk as she twisted her hand at her side and the last crack in the stalactite above Thanos\u2019s head hurtled it\u2019s way towards himself and Gamora. (Y/N) used her right hand to pull Gamora away from the damage, the woman sliding on the ground towards (Y/N) as she used her left hand to force Thanos to crash into his throne, having used the falling boulder as a distraction crushing his body with many crunches that were hopefully his bones, but she doubted it. (Y/N) reached down for Gamora\u2019s hand to pull her up as they both began to run towards the nearest exit.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI was going to wait a bit longer, but he really opened himself up for that one,\u201d (Y/N) laughed, nudging Gamora excitedly, but the woman was clearly in shock with some serious tunnel vision.\u00a0\u201cYou know your way around here right?\u201d (Y/N) called to Gamora who was overcoming her momentary whiplash, but quickly shook herself off, gearing herself into a war mentality.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately. This way, let\u2019s go!\u201d Gamora yelled back, but they both skidded to a stop when Thanos appeared in front of them just before they reached the exit, his image seeming to be unfolded from reality in a tear of red, himself shaking his head in disappointment.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou really believed that would stop me?\u201d Thanos reprimanded as (Y/N) handed Gamora an ice katana.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGotta admit, I kinda hoped so,\u201d (Y/N) taunted back, cracking her neck before she howled into her fight with Thanos, ice katanas wielded as she drove them towards his face, but she was swatted aside just as Gamora reached his calf with the hilt of her own sword. Bouncing off his skin which caused him to become unbalanced, allowing (Y/N) the opportunity to throw another boulder at him where he cascaded into the water with a tsunami of a wave.</p><p>\u00a0 Finding their opening, (Y/N) and Gamora bolted out of the throne room and into a stone-carved hallway, columns rising against the left side of the hallway that opened up to the throne room they had just left, Thanos\u2019s piercing roars echoing off the cavern walls around them like a subway tearing through a tunnel. After each pillar, (Y/N) could see Thanos\u2019s figure rising from the water until he spotted her as well. Thinking quickly, (Y/N) used the pillars to her advantage to hurl at him with her magic as she continued to run, the pillars alight in burning purple magic as they attacked Thanos, knocking him back with each blow until the women veered off to the right and away from the throne room entirely, (Y/N) following Gamora as she knocked aside Black Order members. (Y/N) joined her in the fight as more crowded the hallways.</p><p>\u00a0 It was soon that both women realized that they were right in deciding to become allies because they worked wonders together. Protecting each other\u2019s backs and finishing off a guard that the first one had started. It was very much for (Y/N) like fighting side-by-side with Nat, which she had to stop thinking about because it just reminded her that she wasn\u2019t home yet. But she would get there\u2026even if it killed her.</p><p>\u00a0 But everything came to a halt when Gamora pointed towards another hallway for them to escape through, (Y/N) rounding the corner first to almost have her head torn off by a boulder that Thanos threw that gouged a hole in the stone above her head as (Y/N) threw her arm across Gamora\u2019s chest to stop her from running, them both taking cover behind the wall.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs this the only way to go?\u201d (Y/N) shouted.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFrom here, yes!\u201d Gamora responded in frustration, running through different tunnel variations in her head with no luck, but her words gave (Y/N) an idea. Taking Gamora\u2019s arm, (Y/N) focused her energy on the Orb which glowed before they both fell through a black hole, appearing in a quiet section of the ship that looked like someone\u2019s empty apartment, but made of stone. The ceiling lights were burning red color that reminded (Y/N) of the Red Light District in Amsterdam. Not her first choice in a place to stay, but it would do.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou just thought to use that now?\u201d Gamora accused (Y/N) immediately which made her fold her arms defensively.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you just recently decided to turn against <i>that</i> clusterfuck?\u201d (Y/N) bit back which made Gamora shake her head, silently agreeing with her.\u00a0\u201cBesides, if you really do know where this Vormir place is, then why the fuck would you get close enough to him to get captured? Didn\u2019t think to screw off to some no-name galaxy and wipe away any traces of your existence? Probably would\u2019ve helped the rest of us!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHypocritical much?\u201d Gamora growled back.\u00a0\u201cBringing the Power Stone to Thanos because your pride outweighs your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) considered Gamora for a moment, then nodded her head and extended her hand to her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFair enough,\u201d (Y/N) acquiesced as Gamora accepted her hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe won\u2019t get anywhere if we fight each other, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAgreed. Do you know where we are now?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Gamora hummed as she walked to the window, peering past the curtains into the ship.\u00a0\u201cWest Wing. We need to get to Section 47 that houses all the ships. The only problem is that it\u2019s probably already flooded with guards, so\u2026is there any way you could transport us off of the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI just found out that I could do this shit today. Not exactly an expert, yet,\u201d (Y/N) huffed, trying to calm down the panic that was rising inside of her.\u00a0\u201cWhat if you described it to me, this Section 47. Maybe, I could transport us there if I had an image in my head\u2026and hopefully not transport us straight into space where we suffocate and die,\u201d (Y/N) rambled nervously as she peered out the window as well to see a large cavern that was completely void of life, only blue flickering lights cast an eerie image on the cold, stone walls.\u00a0\u201cI mean unless you can think of some other way to get us out of here that wouldn\u2019t involve the risk of moonwalking to our graves?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving without my sister,\u201d Gamora stated.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOr risk\u2026wait, what?\u201d (Y/N) asked numbly, not really believing what she had just heard.\u00a0\u201cDid you just say\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe mentioned my sister. I won\u2019t leave without her,\u201d Gamora insisted again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Y/N) whisper-screamed, slamming the curtains shut as she began to pace in front of Gamora.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAbout wanting to help my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, about being an idiot!\u201d (Y/N) argued back, then calmed herself down again, running her hands through her hair.\u00a0\u201cHow the hell do you even know he has her? All he said was that you shouldn\u2019t disappoint her, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, maybe that \u2018whatever\u2019 is the part where you missed that he obviously has her. That was his threat to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExactly! Let\u2019s not let that threat work!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you have a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEven if I did, we\u2019re not playing this dumbass empathy game. I\u2019m not going back, and you\u2019re not either, so let me ask a better question? Do you want to be the reason that half the Universe will die? No? Didn\u2019t think so. Now, what are we thinking? Steal a ship and Hans Solo it out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour references mean nothing to me!\u201d Gamora whispered harshly back at (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cAnd I know what I\u2019m risking. My sister has made\u2026mistakes in her past, but she is still my sister. Just thinking about what Thanos will do to her if I leave her here\u2026she was always a pawn to him, just like me and everyone else. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll let her live this time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) watched Gamora intently, Gamora\u2019s own eyes never leaving (Y/N)\u2019s face. This was something that she wanted, and if she was anything like Thanos, she was going to get it. Unintentionally, (Y/N)\u2019s mind reeled back to her brother clutching at her hand before he was shot in their childhood home, his promises of safety echoing in her mind before she shook herself out of it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no, No, nO, NO, and did I mention no?\u201d (Y/N) spluttered out.\u00a0\u201cI know how hard this must be, but you have to think logically. You have information that Thanos can\u2019t have. I\u2019m just being honest here, but there\u2019s a 50/50 chance that your sister wouldn\u2019t even make it out alive after \u2018the snap\u2019\u00a0anyway, but at least in this scenario, you and I don\u2019t have to get captured. Here\u2019s a weapon. Now, let\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d (Y/N) commanded, taking Steve\u2019s tone that seemed to break Gamora for a second as she took the katana from (Y/N), but the moment didn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet me rephrase, then\u2026I can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Gamora whispered.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at the things you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLike leave you here on this ship without a way off of it?\u201d Gamora threatened which made (Y/N) put her hand dramatically to her chest.\u00a0\u201cLook, I know the way out of here and how to fly a ship. Can you do either of those things?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026won\u2019t know until I try it. And I\u2019m always up for new opportunities to put on my job resume when this superheroing comes to an end,\u201d (Y/N) responded sarcastically,\u00a0narrowing her eyes at Gamora who was still watching her intently, crossed arms glued to her chest.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t do this! I\u00a0have to get home!\u201d (Y/N) exclaimed.\u00a0\u201cI have people wating for me, people I need to protect. I\u2019m sorry about your sister, if she\u2019s even here, but I have people of my own! I\u2019m not screwing over my chance to be with them again just because you have a\u00a0\u2018hunch\u2019 that Thanos has her. I\u2019m sorry, but this is ridiculous. We are halfway to escaping and you\u2019re willing to give that up? No. Nope. No way. There\u2019s not a chance in hell that you\u2019re gonna convince me to go back for a suicide mission.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u00a0 A few minutes later\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHow <i>the fuck</i> did you convince me to come back here?\u201d (Y/N) whispered, still in shock at the stupid decision she had made as she forced a frozen guard between the wall behind where Nebula was strung up by some kind of gravitational pull.\u00a0(Y/N) and Gamora had been on their way to a smaller ship dock that Gamora figured would be easier to infiltrate, but as they were getting closer, they had heard the piercing screams of a woman that raked down (Y/N)\u2019s spine like nails.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>\u201cWell\u2026that could be anyone,\u201d</i> (Y/N) had posited before Gamora forced them both to take a detour into Thanos\u2019s supposed torture chamber. Now, Gamora was attempting to figure out the mechanics of releasing Nebula while (Y/N) took care of the guard\u2019s <i>possibly</i> dead bodies. She didn\u2019t know and definitely didn\u2019t care enough to find out.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Just as Gamora began to crack the code, the walls to the chamber began to open which scared the absolute hell out of (Y/N), her body frozen to the spot. In a rush, Gamora hissed at (Y/N) to hide as she stood to face her father, her body poised defensively in front of the blue-toned woman hovering mid-air, the mechanical pieces of her body floating away from each other to leave her body disjointed, her torso unconnected from her head, arm not attached to her shoulder, and so on. It was\u2026ungodly\u2026like nothing (Y/N) had ever seen before, even in her years locked inside of Hydra, the torture capital of Earth.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to,\u201d Gamora insisted through gritted teeth to (Y/N), knowing that there was nothing (Y/N) could do to argue as Thanos\u2019s shadow appeared beyond the realm of the chamber.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd so she returns,\u201d Thanos boasted, knowing his threat had worked.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot for you,\u201d Gamora deadpanned.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI thought as much,\u201d Thanos responded, taking a seat on the stoop in front of the chamber, facing away from Nebula as he patted the section next to him for Gamora to sit. She stood a few feet in front of him instead, back turned to him as she watched the murky black water ebb and flow as it always had for twenty years. Twenty goddamned, miserable years. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me (Y/N) left so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe left me to fend for myself. She thought only one of us should risk capture,\u201d Gamora grumbled bitterly as (Y/N) squeezed her way through the opening in the wall to the tablet that Gamora had been punching in codes, glancing up to see the robot-girl from a closer angle, the view even more ghastly up close. The woman\u2019s eyes were frozen open in a state of shock, unblinking. Hopefully, she couldn\u2019t feel any of the horrible things that were happening to her, but (Y/N) knew better. Even when her attention turned to the control panel, Nebula\u2019s petrified eyes still haunted (Y/N)\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u00a0 The conversation between Thanos and Gamora ranged from hateful words to promises of family, to even more hateful words, until (Y/N) heard this bullshit:</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cInteresting\u2026is that why she\u2019s stressing over the control system to free your sister?\u201d Thanos accused, turning his head to watch (Y/N)\u2019s head flip up to his, her eyes wide at being caught as she began to furiously bang at the tablet until it hit the ground with the crack of glass and fizzle of a dying car battery, herself blowing the wisps of hair out of her face in frustration.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know what, you should really consider making this thing more user-friendly,\u201d (Y/N) accused back as Gamora rolled her eyes. Even Nebula\u2019s was able to let out an annoyed sigh. \u201cI actually know a great tech guy. Stark Industries. Could get this shit sorted out in minutes,\u201d (Y/N) offered rapidly just as one of the guards fell from her ice prison with a dull smack like a drunken Death Eater on the metal flooring.\u00a0\u201cHe was like that when I got here-\u201d (Y/N) proclaimed, but her voice was choked out of her throat as Thanos wielded his gauntlet, bringing her closer to him in rows of red chains that tightened around her body the more she tried to struggle out of them.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChildren,\u201d Thanos grumbled lowly as he looked down on Gamora. \u201cI\u00a0never taught you to lie\u2026that\u2019s why you\u2019re so bad at it,\u201d Thanos hissed at her, then turned his attention to (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cAnd I thought better of you. <i>Expected</i> more of you. An open mind and more common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean, thought that was a pretty good run\u2026considering,\u201d (Y/N) croaked out, her midsection being strangled by the anaconda-like pressure.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Thanos enunciated darkly, leaving Gamora to lower her head behind him as he approached (Y/N), his tongue ticking at her as he placed a finger under her chin.\u00a0\u201cI suppose now is the time to enforce some harsher discipline, seeing as you cannot seem to control yourself.\u201d (Y/N) yanked her face away from Thanos, her eyes glowing deathly white, far past her usual silver. She caught sight of Gamora mouthing something to her, but (Y/N) couldn\u2019t make it out as\u00a0Thanos\u2019s fist opened and closed, his fingertips beginning to burn with blue energy that (Y/N) recognized as the space stone.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMind control,\u201d (Y/N) scoffed.\u00a0\u201cAnd I thought I asked for some creativity.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhatever it takes to get the job done,\u201d Thanos grinned just as he aimed his fist for (Y/N)\u2019s face.\u00a0\u201cAnything more to add?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026burn in hell,\u201d (Y/N) snarled, making Thanos cock his head, a wicked grin splitting his face as the blue aura became a raging fire,\u00a0but Gamora grabbed his arm at the last moment to point at her instead.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, distracting him just as (Y/N) broke free from her bondage, charging Thanos, but he rounded on her, the palm of his other hand meeting the center of her forehead that made her eyes roll into the back of her head. All those years in yoga and this was the first time that she actually felt her third eye open up\u2026or maybe that was the splitting of her skull. Either way, a rapid-fire projection show of images from her past surfaced in her mind too quick for her to focus on one embarrassing moment at a time. Outside of her mind, time seemed to be frozen as her limp body floated among the blue magic that forced Gamora to fly and hit her back against a stone wall where she crumpled to the ground. She tried to fight the force, but it was too much. The Infinity Stone would\u2019ve killed her, just like everyone else in the Universe except for one\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Moments passed under the Space Stone\u2019s spell until (Y/N) hit the ground in a runner\u2019s stance, now shrouded in a <a href=\"http://rowan-and-rhysand-trash.tumblr.com/post/145800346769/swords-are-boring-indeed-aelin-galathynius\">black cloak</a>\u00a0with silver detailing laced around the edges like frost in the night, battle armor adorning her figure as her hair fell like a veil of death over her face. Taking a few breaths, she finally rose, eyes snapping open to meet Thanos\u2019s, but all she could see were shadows in a sea of blue haze. She had no idea what was going on until she felt her own cold, broken lips begin to move, mind not in control of her own actions.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMaster, I am here to serve, \u201d her voice hollowly contended as she felt her left knee kiss the cold metal ground, her head lowering in a bow of respect.</p><p>\u00a0 She was trapped inside of her own body.</p><p>\u00a0 Desperately, her mind demanded her limbs to obey her, to fight back, to kill the bastard who was dead set to kill almost everyone she loved and cared for, but she was helpless to the spell. And with the gruesome realization of her unwilling obedience to the Mad Titan himself, the darkness overcame her.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYUJMbc4I2mRJul-C-Rv_7w\">@fanaticwritings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5HZ3U1t8DOK0pLeTjKskg\">@inumorph</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myqn4ifHH58bObOtyht1FSQ\">@dawn121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN9DldOxAXGIUkDC3VjZmxg\">@bubbleteaproduction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miiBX34jw1Mz_9yBxwbM8FA\">@deanskitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc3YhKa0nQ6C5c50zMTXYA\">@shamvictoria11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz6K1NOqNRuKlsKl705UBJw\">@maybeiamamermaid</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a></p><p><a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/148438393715/the-ultimate-masterlist\">MASTERLIST</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/174735659745/chapter-1-the-orb-avengers-x-femreader\">Chapter 1</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175071067210/chapter-2-currently-fearing-the-reaper-avengers\">Chapter 2</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175400908850/chapter-3-earth-is-closed-today-avengers-x\">Chapter 3</a></p><p>*please follow and let me know if you\u2019d like to be tagged.

(Y/N)!\u201d Tony called out, his voice straining from the tightness of his throat, blood and tears mixing on his wounded skin, but he needed to find her. It was a gnawing urge that forced his buried panic to resurface like a weight on his chest. Once more, he let his person slip between his fingertips, and once again he realized that no one could hate him as much as he hated himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Strange cut in, but Tony was inconsolable, himself beginning to search further inside Ebony Maw\u2019s\u00a0ship, the creatures dead body still lying where (Y/N) had stabbed him.\u00a0\u201cStark, there\u2019s no use. She\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t lose her! Not again. (Y/N)!\u201d Tony countered, trying to convince himself more than Strange, but he knew at this moment that he had lost it. Tony continued to pace, calling out her name until Peter stepped in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMr. Stark, we\u2026we haven\u2019t lost her, yet,\u201d Peter coaxed quietly, making Tony lock his jaw.\u00a0\u201cYou know (Y/N). If anything, I\u2019d be nervous for Thanos. I\u2019m not really happy about it, but doing what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t really helping either\u2026sir.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat? Screaming her name into the void isn\u2019t helping?\u201d Tony joked back, his heart not really in it, but understood Peter\u2019s point\u00a0as he patted him on the shoulder.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re on the right track, kid\u2026she was right about you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTouching moment, you two,\u201d Strange interjected impatiently, seeing as to how Tony\u2019s panic attack had now passed\u2026mostly. \u201cBut finding her isn\u2019t the priority now. If it really is Thanos who has her, then I\u2019m sure wherever he is, she\u2019ll be. Titan is still our best option.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDid you lose your emotions during a wizarding accident, or something?\u201d Tony accused, but Strange ignored his jab, instead watching the oncoming planet that their ship was headed straight towards, the impact imminent.</p><p>\u00a0 Walking by Tony, Peter made one last comment.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) has never given up on anything. We shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d Peter proposed as he made his way towards the helm of the ship. Tony, in that moment, had never been more proud of Peter. The kid still had so much potential. So much.</p><p>\u00a0 But reality hit him straight in the face when he witnessed the barren wasteland they were about to crash into. With any luck, wherever (Y/N) was, it was better than dealing with this shit.</p><hr><p>READER\u2019S\u00a0POV</p><p>\u00a0 Maybe, (Y/N) had finally lost her mind. Maybe, today should be the day that she gives in to her psychosis. To be free of reality, and live by the flow that life leads for her to follow, taking it one bare, naked footstep through the flower field at a time. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? To just let go. Wouldn\u2019t that just be the dream? A lustful, 1970\u2032s\u00a0Stevie Nicks, acid-tripping, peaceful-protesting, flower-powering fantasy? <i>Fantasy</i> being the key word.</p><p>\u00a0 The colors faded in and out of focus, melding together in powdered smoke that rose deep inside her mind\u2019s eye. The closer she reached to consciousness, the more violent the colors became. The more the dust became the fire shot from a gun, bullets piercing her brain with each flash of hair-raising vibrancy. A shock. A bang. An explosion. A chaotic warfare forcing a battering ram into the doors of her psyche that were locked tight around the barriers of her awareness, but the wood was splintering and the fires were igniting. They were burning red hot into a lick of yellow, transforming into the spindly fingers of a wicked green, contorting into a ball of raging blue that scorched her into consciousness with a sharp yelp that evaporated into the humid air.</p><p>\u00a0 Deep inhales were all her body could manage as a cold sweat trickled down her spine to overcompensate the burning sensation that continued to blister her skin. The abrupt awakening sparked her eyes with a newfound urgency and arrow-point accuracy as they searched the dark, damp cavern that she found herself in, the view beyond the metal beams that trapped her as ancient as time itself. The best way to describe her predicament would be to say that she was a bird trapped in a cage, feeling the weight of herself and the chair she was strapped to not firm on solid ground, but rather levitating by the fiery blue energy that had shocked her from her dream, it\u2019s poisonous tendrils wrapping themselves around her bare toes that prickled with sleep. The faint drips of something liquid and the far-off echoes of bangs of the inner-working of a metallic ship caught her attention as she felt another person\u2019s presence suck the air from her lungs.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Not knowing the entity would yet to cease her tounge.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI hope you have more than some handcuffs and a few metal bars to intimidate me, becuase if you think this is the first time I\u2019ve been in this situation, then you don\u2019t realize how kinky I can really get,\u201d (Y/N) panted out more confidently than her body could manage, just barely lifting up her head enough to see through the wild hair that mangled her vision, hoping to size up her captor.\u00a0\u201cHonestly, hit me with your best shot. I\u2019m looking for the full production. Entertainment at it\u2019s fucking finest.\u00a0Really inspire me here. I\u2019m asking for torture creativity\u2026\u201d she ranted until she finally caught sight of her captor through the shadows, his figure looming ominously just beyond the edge of the water-filled chasm she was perched above, and wow. She was not ready.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour petulance astounds me, child. You\u2019re much more brazen than even I had anticipated through my years of watching you grow,\u201d her captor announced, his massive body somehow more intense than even Hulk to match. But what really caught her attention (besides the thing that was growing on his chin that she soon realized was just his chin) was his voice. The voice from her dream.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>Thanos</i>. And as much as she hated to admit it, the name and recognition of his identity alone dropped her heart into the pit of her stomach with a dull thud. It wasn\u2019t just his size, but the way he stood and commanded the room. There was no trace of doubt. He knew what he wanted and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he wouldn\u2019t do to get it. Years of patience had brought him this far, and he had finally decided that he had mastered his craft. It was less from his words that she perceived this, but from his eyes that were more than dark, but focused. Focused on one path, and one alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 It was one he shared with her own father.</p><p>\u00a0 But she recovered quickly, dragging her eyes like claws in the dirt to focus on his, despite the guttural instinct inside of her that screamed at her ragdoll limbs to tuck themselves into a ball and hide. But that instinct was buried with the rest of her fear, locked tight inside a box next to the other box that, apparently, held her will to live.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more purple than I thought you would be,\u201d (Y/N) responded apathetically. \u201cGuess, we both got an unwelcomed surprise today.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI disagree,\u201d Thanos countered patiently.\u00a0\u201cYou are enthusiasically welcomed on my ship. More welcome than possibly anyone here, in fact. My hope lies in your willingness to give great thought and action to what I am told the late Ebony has evoked upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHow \u2018bout, instead, I give you a fresh basket of <i>go fuck yourself</i>, and we both go off on our happy, merry ways. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, she was jerked forward, gripping the edges of her chair with her chipped nails as the cage hovered towards Thanos, his fist balled in a golden, Hamburger Helper glove that willed her to him. Regaining her composure, she held Thanos\u2019 glare, matching his intensity as she neared his unusually scarred and cratered face that reminded her of a Grand Canyon on an alien planet that nobody would ever want to visit.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t forget that you\u2019re the one in the cage,\u201d Thanos threatened as the tendrils wrapped around her ankles, but she kicked them off with a scoff.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAll the more reason to prove that you\u2019re terrified of me,\u201d she purred through a smirk as she watched Thanos\u2019 frown deepen.\u00a0\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t think you can control me otherwise? Becuase on this one thing, you\u2019d be right\u2026but just so we\u2019re clear, everything else you\u2019re preaching is a complete bust and, ultimately going to fail. It didn\u2019t work for Hitler, so what makes you so special?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPetty how you only see the Universe through the lens of your own planet and it\u2019s many\u00a0downfalls when there are so many beings, too many beings, for you to even comprehend.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, good morning, Mr. High and Mighty. Maybe, I should introduce you to Humility sometime. Guess since you\u2019re deep-fisting a few Infinity Stones, you now think you have all the answers then, don\u2019t you? This just in, buddy,\u201d (Y/N) dared, the fear creeping into her throat, but she shoved it back down, focusing on her words rather than her emotions as she tugged at the Power Stone that, surprisingly, still hung around her neck.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got one too. Which begs the question: why? You\u2019ve got me locked in this cage <i>with</i> the stone, instead of dead and without it. You say you\u2019ve got this master plan, but so far, I\u2019m not putting the pieces together here, so maybe\u2026\u201d (Y/N) paused her rant for a moment, closing her eyes to take a breath to calm herself down, a plan of her own hatching in her brain that wasn\u2019t her typical style, but a means to an end\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes flickered up to Thanos\u2019s once more, her head cocked to the side in question which peeked his interest.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo on,\u201d Thanos prodded.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut maybe because I haven\u2019t gotten the full story, yet,\u201d she wondered aloud.\u00a0\u201cAll I\u2019ve heard about you sounds straight out of a legend from the mouths of people you\u2019d either just threatened, or hired. Maybe I haven\u2019t heard your side of the story yet and since you\u2019ve so stupidly allowed me to live this long, I take it you probably want to share it with me. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cVery intuitive,\u201d Thanos grinned as he took a seat on his throne, waving the chains away from (Y/N)\u2019s wrists and ankles, allowing her the opportunity to lounge in her own chair\u00a0that felt like a broken lawn chair in comparison to his, but she never wavered in her confidence.\u00a0\u201cBut I must ask: what changed your mind so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Thanos drawled as he began to relax, taking note of his prisoner\u2019s false face that she wore, so familiar to the one his daughter had worn in the years before her betrayal. The one that had led to her being knocked out at the foot of his throne while he took the opportuity to interrogate his new and improved right-hand in peace.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBefore we start your therapy session, maybe we talk about the poor soul you have sniffing your toes first?\u201d (Y/N) asked, her empathy well-masked, yet unmistakable to Thanos which made his mouth twitch into a tight-lipped grin.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll get to her,\u201d he mused, making (Y/N) lift an eyebrow and hold her hands up defensively, motioning for him to begin.\u00a0\u201cGrowing up, my home planet of Titan was constantly on the brink of collapse from famine, disease, and war. Every day was a struggle. It was in that time watching my people starve that I came up with the idea to balance the population. To kill half of the people in order for my planet to flourish in their wake. Random, of course. The rich, the poor, and whoever in between. Chaos into balance. All for the rest of my planet to become happy and healthy for centuries to come. To finally be able to live.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, you know what they say about chaos?\u201d (Y/N) sighed, quoting Heath Ledger\u2019s, the Joker.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI had a feeling that you were right for the job,\u201d Thanos smiled in approval, making (Y/N) smile to herself.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d (Y/N) mused, wondering if she should point out Thanos\u2019s connection to, in her opinion, one of the greatest villains of all-time, but thought better of it in order to keep up with her plan to keep the peace.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos watched her face carefully, but she remained neutral, only nodding after her comment as she waited for him to continue.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cSo desperately did they crave salvation, a solution to their inevitable demise, yet when I offered them one\u2026\u201d Thanos recalled darkly, shaking his head in disapproval,\u00a0\u201cthey called me a Madman. And once my planet turned to ruins, I knew that I had been right. And now, here we are. So many planets so close to extinction, so many people suffering when the solution is right here with me. I refuse to allow another waste of a civilization.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut if your problem is a starving population, why not use the stones to provide a meal a day to those who need it? Snap, and there\u2019s a Thanksgiving dinner for half the world sitting on their table.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut genocide is?\u201d (Y/N) countered, but quickly realized his mind had been set for decades. His expression was immovable, so (Y/N) changed her tone.\u00a0\u201cHow are you so sure that this would work?\u201d (Y/N) asked calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t my first time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 That shocked (Y/N), and there was no way that she could hide it. She suddenly got a glimpse of the slaughtering of millions, blood, gore, and death. Bodies stacked upon bodies. Something out of Chainsaw Massacre. Something like she had experienced in Hydra. How has he not been stopped, yet? Or, at least, had she never heard of him before? This seems like a major issue that should have been addressed ages ago.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSurprised? So was she,\u201d Thanos grinned, gazing down at the woman on the ground beneath him, her jade-hued fingers beginning to twitch. He cocked his head to the side.\u00a0\u201cMaybe she should be the one to tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Closing his fist, a flash of blue light erupted from his glove as the woman\u2019s eyes shot open in a panic, herself standing up to address her attacker as she drew her sword. Her hyperventilation filled the room until her eyes landed on Thanos, her hatred pure and unforgiving as she started towards him only to have her weapon dissipate in a flurry of bubbles just as it reached Thanos\u2019s neck. The woman flew backwards to land on the ground in front of (Y/N)\u2019s cage, hitting her head against the bars that had finally landed on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Had to admit, (Y/N) was impressed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou brought me back here?\u201d She snarled at Thanos as she stood.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere else would I take you, Daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDaughter?\u201d (Y/N) choked out. Both Thanos and his, apparently, daughter turned on her.\u00a0\u201cSorry, you just don\u2019t really seem like the, uh\u2026fatherly type.\u201d<br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHardly. And he\u2019s not my father,\u201d the woman growled back at Thanos.\u00a0\u201cSo,\u00a0now you have a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not a prisoner,\u201d Thanos explained casually.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean, I kind of feel like a prisoner,\u201d (Y/N) shrugged as she tapped the bars with her fingernails.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOnly until I have your full cooperation, Little One,\u201d Thanos mused, his lips pulling into a sneer as his daughter tensed. She hung her head low, avoiding his eye contact, but the guilt and self-loathing was clear in her face. (Y/N) wasn\u2019t sure why, but this seemed like a very personal blow from Thanos.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo this is why you took her? To replace me?\u201d The woman accused, narrowing her eyes at Thanos who still had his lips curled.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHardly,\u201d he responded coldly, echoing his daughter\u2019s words.\u00a0\u201cShe is much more powerful than even you were, and the only one that will be able to retrieve the Infinity Stone that I need. Something you were unable to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 This grabbed his daughter\u2019s attention, her eyes finally meeting his as he towered directly over her.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I disappointed you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos let out another disapproving sigh as he leaned closer to her.\u00a0\u201cI am disappointed,\u201d he stated, taking a strand of her wavy red hair.\u00a0\u201cAnd not becuase you didn\u2019t find it, but because you did. And you lied.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The tension hung in the air as they both sized each other up, Thanos not wanting to hurt his daughter, and her probably wanting to hurt him, but knowing that she couldn\u2019t. (Y/N) finally decided to step in.\u00a0\u201cUh, not that I\u2019m not fully entertained by your family drama and wouldn\u2019t invest in a Keeping Up With the Infinity Stones, but\u2026this seems like a very personal matter. Should I\u2026maybe step out, or\u2026? Becuase it seems like you two have some things to work out here-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d the woman insisted.\u00a0\u201cI know exactly where I stand.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, Gamora,\u201d Thanos sighed.\u00a0\u201cHow you continue to disappoint me. But my question is, would you dare to disappoint your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a sister, too?\u201d (Y/N) exclaimed, Thanos and Gamora glared at her again.\u00a0\u201cLike I said, should I step outside?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Thanos denied, focusing his attention on (Y/N) now which she suddenly regretted as Thanos began to encircle her like a shark sniffing out his next meal.\u00a0\u201cBut what I do want is for you to give me your final thoughts on the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) let out a laugh, leaning back in her chair again.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I would if you told me exactly what you wanted me to do in this whole <i>plan </i>of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Gamora\u2019s face cringed in disgust at (Y/N)\u2019s words, confused as to why this random girl would even consider his cruelty. Who the hell was she?</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d Thanos smiled as he turned his back on her to return to his throne, beginning his explanation as he walked. In those seconds, (Y/N) gained Gamora\u2019s attention and mouthed, <i>we have to work together</i>, widening her eyes hoping that Gamora understood. At first, Gamora seemed to distrust (Y/N), but quickly realized that the girl was in a cage, so Thanos obviously didn\u2019t trust her. Which made her the perfect ally.\u00a0\u201cAs I mentioned before, I have watched you grow from afar. Ever since you came in contact with the Orb, my interest in you has grown. You\u2019ve been through so much, child, seen so much. You have witnessed the worst of humanity, the places in which resources are limited and want is plentiful, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d (Y/N) responded, letting the emotions of what she had experienced during her days on the streets consume her. Look, if she wanted Thanos to trust her, she really had to sell it.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is one reason why I have chosen you. I think that you, of all people, will understand my vision. The assistance that may be offered to those in need.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd the other reason you chose me?\u201d (Y/N) prodded, ignoring his failed logic.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour connection with the Vision.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, you already said that,\u201d (Y/N) contended after a moment, making Thanos frown. And that was not a pretty sight.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, child. <i>The</i> Vision. The keeper of the Mind Stone,\u201d Thanos explained further as (Y/N) did an awkward, <i>ohhhhh, right, </i>taking full responsibility of her own failed logic.\u00a0\u201cYes, you know him well.\u201d (Y/N) cocked her head to the side.\u00a0\u201cWell enough, then,\u201d Thanos corrected.\u00a0\u201cWhat I need from you is to take the stone from him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze. No more jokes. This got much more serious in an instant. Yes, aiding Thanos in any way would be disgusting and wrong, but to actually be the one to, not only <i>take</i> the stone, but to be the one to take Vision\u2019s life? To kill the only person, besides maybe herself, that has come anywhere close to the relationship that Wanda had with her brother? Yeah, no. She had to get the fuck out of there, pronto.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) scoffed, still maintaining her neutrality.\u00a0\u201cSo, you think that becuase I\u2019m friends with Vision, that that would make it easier to assassinate him?\u201d (Y/N) questioned.\u00a0\u201cYeah, that makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA small price to pay,\u201d Thanos proclaimed as (Y/N) made a face.\u00a0\u201cYour relationship will allow you to get close to him and take the stone before he can defend himself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo betray his trust?\u201d (Y/N) broke in.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNow you understand,\u201d Thanos smiled (didn\u2019t think anything could be worse than the frowing, but she was wrong). (Y/N) shook her head, completely miffed by this dude\u2019s departure from sanity and lack of humanity. She was right. There wasn\u2019t anything that he wouldn\u2019t do, and no biting comment she would make was going to change that. Acceptance, whether it was real or not, would be her only way out.\u00a0\u201cAll you need to do is give me the Mind Stone, then this can all be over as soon as it started. Then, the Universe can truly begin to renew itself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis <i>has</i> gone by insanely quick,\u201d (Y/N) whispered in awe (that wasn\u2019t entirely disingenuous), thinking that just a few hours ago she was back on Earth watching pigeons cage match over some road-kill hot dog from the window of a wizard\u2019s lair. She looked up to Thanos.\u00a0\u201cYou really do believe in this?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow could you even think of doing this?\u201d Gamora yelled at her, charging her cell.\u00a0\u201cI know that I don\u2019t know you, but this can\u2019t be something that you want! The pain and suffering that my planet felt after he came and destroyed it remains. Yes, there may be more resources to go around, but we will never forgive what we lost or forget who we lost. Never.\u201d By the end, Gamora had tears streaming down her cheeks, anger boiling over. Her pain was tangible, squeezing (Y/N)\u2019s own stomach at the thought of her own friends and family\u2026</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut this is just one generation,\u201d (Y/N) argued back, leaving Gamora speechless and bringing Thanos to lean closer in anticipation to her next words, his elbows resting on his knees.\u00a0\u201cOnce this generation has passed, and those who had to deal with the agony have come and gone, all you have left is the good that has come out of your father\u2019s plan. I\u2019m sure, whether you know it or not, some people now have already found gratefulness in what he\u2019s done\u2026and I think that I would be among them,\u201d (Y/N) concluded thoughtfully, throwing a knowing look to Thanos who studied her closely.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose everything,\u201d Gamora swore, and that\u2019s where (Y/N) let out a dark laugh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLosing loved ones is old news for me,\u201d (Y/N) dismissed.\u00a0\u201cOnce you get through the hurricane, there\u2019s always a way come back from the destruction. I watched my entire family die right in front of me, and I\u2019m still here. In fact, I\u2019ve made a new one of my own, and I can do it again.\u00a0If I can make it so others can live a life better than mine, I\u2019m all in.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 And in that moment, her cage dissolved in an array of shiny bubbles that reflected the shock in both (Y/N)\u2019s and Gamora\u2019s expressions. Thanos barely lifted a finger, his arms still resting on his throne that were carved in what resembled crocodile skin. Fitting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFinally\u2026a worthy ally. Welcome to the Black Order, (Y/N), my newfound pride and glory,\u201d Thanos announced as (Y/N) did an awkward curtsy thing that she didn\u2019t even understand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, really, but uh,\u00a0I hope I can first ask\u2026\u201d (Y/N) began, putting a slight shake into her voice which seemed to please Thanos greatly as he smiled down to her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course you may,\u201d Thanos allowed as (Y/N) nodded with a shy smile.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere exactly are we?\u201d (Y/N) asked, suppressing a laugh when she heard Gamora grumble about her\u00a0\u2018own personal hellscape.\u2019\u00a0\u201cMaybe near somewhere that I know like Sakaar, or Xandar, or\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cXandar has already been destroyed,\u201d Thanos interrupted, a bragging tone entering his voice as (Y/N)\u2019s own faltered with a small,<i> oh</i>.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about them. Their planet was doomed from the very beginning. Have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cNo, I uh\u2026I\u2019ve just heard stories.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cIf you had been, I promise that you would have seen it\u2019s uselessness. However,\u00a0I found fragments of the Orb there,\u201d Thanos explained, revealing one of the sockets on his glove to be halfway filled with a piece of amethyst light,\u00a0\u201cbut once I discovered the rest of the stone\u2019s\u00a0transfer to Asgard, I knew, not only of Xandar\u2019s time to be decimated, but that\u00a0Loki would be the perfect option to reunite you with the stone. Why you ever decided to part ways with it to begin with, I shall never fully understand. You were one of the fiercest warriors I had ever seen. I suppose now I shall make you so once more.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLoki? How did you\u2026?\u201d (Y/N) questioned (ignoring his comment about \u2018once\u2019 being the fiercest, since she was still the fiercest, so fuck him) as she slowly put the pieces together.\u00a0\u201cNew York. You were already in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s quite persistent when he wants to be,\u201d Thanos complimented.\u00a0\u201cBut his lack of conviction is repulsive. His use had quickly worn thin.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHad?\u201d (Y/N) choked out, her voice so small from the tightness that grew inside her throat.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you cared for him? After his attempt to take control of your planet?\u201d Thanos chided her which just\u2026she had to swallow down,\u00a0\u2018<i>then what the hell are you doing?</i>\u2019 And\u00a0\u2018<i>but you were the one who sent him to Earth</i>,\u2019 to instead take a moment to gather more intel about her surroundings. She found a few ways to escape, but only one really stood out to her.\u00a0\u201cBut returning to your primary question, we are just outside of Knowhere. Pitiful place, alas it is where I found, not only the Reality Stone, but my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd she\u2019s ever so grateful,\u201d Gamora murmured coldly with her arms crossed over her chest. She was more like (Y/N) than she could even know. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDaughter, you continue to forget your once shared loyalty to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat was before I knew I had a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you chose wrong,\u201d Thanos growled as he leaned towards Gamora again.\u00a0\u201cWhere is the Soul Stone?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gamora demanded, gritting her teeth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, come on,\u201d (Y/N) scoffed, rolling her eyes which surprised both Gamora and Thanos.\u00a0\u201cI mean, he\u2019s going to get it out of you, so just bite the bullet on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Gamora shot back, making (Y/N) sigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not as good an actress as you think, and he\u2019s got two and a half Infinity Stones while you have none. It\u2019s common sense, really.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou heard her,\u201d Thanos rumbled, throwing an appreciatory glance at (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cOut with it, Gamora. If not, you know that I have other methods of making you talk. And I wouldn\u2019t want to have to crush you when all you have to do is give me a name.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, there was a small burst of giggling that floated in the air. Thanos wrinkled up his face as he found the source in (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d he demanded at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d (Y/N) sighed, waving him off.\u00a0\u201cI guess it\u2019s just funny because\u2026I was thinking the same thing,\u201d she finished with a smirk as she twisted her hand at her side and the last crack in the stalactite above Thanos\u2019s head hurtled it\u2019s way towards himself and Gamora. (Y/N) used her right hand to pull Gamora away from the damage, the woman sliding on the ground towards (Y/N) as she used her left hand to force Thanos to crash into his throne, having used the falling boulder as a distraction crushing his body with many crunches that were hopefully his bones, but she doubted it. (Y/N) reached down for Gamora\u2019s hand to pull her up as they both began to run towards the nearest exit.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI was going to wait a bit longer, but he really opened himself up for that one,\u201d (Y/N) laughed, nudging Gamora excitedly, but the woman was clearly in shock with some serious tunnel vision.\u00a0\u201cYou know your way around here right?\u201d (Y/N) called to Gamora who was overcoming her momentary whiplash, but quickly shook herself off, gearing herself into a war mentality.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately. This way, let\u2019s go!\u201d Gamora yelled back, but they both skidded to a stop when Thanos appeared in front of them just before they reached the exit, his image seeming to be unfolded from reality in a tear of red, himself shaking his head in disappointment.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou really believed that would stop me?\u201d Thanos reprimanded as (Y/N) handed Gamora an ice katana.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGotta admit, I kinda hoped so,\u201d (Y/N) taunted back, cracking her neck before she howled into her fight with Thanos, ice katanas wielded as she drove them towards his face, but she was swatted aside just as Gamora reached his calf with the hilt of her own sword. Bouncing off his skin which caused him to become unbalanced, allowing (Y/N) the opportunity to throw another boulder at him where he cascaded into the water with a tsunami of a wave.</p><p>\u00a0 Finding their opening, (Y/N) and Gamora bolted out of the throne room and into a stone-carved hallway, columns rising against the left side of the hallway that opened up to the throne room they had just left, Thanos\u2019s piercing roars echoing off the cavern walls around them like a subway tearing through a tunnel. After each pillar, (Y/N) could see Thanos\u2019s figure rising from the water until he spotted her as well. Thinking quickly, (Y/N) used the pillars to her advantage to hurl at him with her magic as she continued to run, the pillars alight in burning purple magic as they attacked Thanos, knocking him back with each blow until the women veered off to the right and away from the throne room entirely, (Y/N) following Gamora as she knocked aside Black Order members. (Y/N) joined her in the fight as more crowded the hallways.</p><p>\u00a0 It was soon that both women realized that they were right in deciding to become allies because they worked wonders together. Protecting each other\u2019s backs and finishing off a guard that the first one had started. It was very much for (Y/N) like fighting side-by-side with Nat, which she had to stop thinking about because it just reminded her that she wasn\u2019t home yet. But she would get there\u2026even if it killed her.</p><p>\u00a0 But everything came to a halt when Gamora pointed towards another hallway for them to escape through, (Y/N) rounding the corner first to almost have her head torn off by a boulder that Thanos threw that gouged a hole in the stone above her head as (Y/N) threw her arm across Gamora\u2019s chest to stop her from running, them both taking cover behind the wall.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs this the only way to go?\u201d (Y/N) shouted.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFrom here, yes!\u201d Gamora responded in frustration, running through different tunnel variations in her head with no luck, but her words gave (Y/N) an idea. Taking Gamora\u2019s arm, (Y/N) focused her energy on the Orb which glowed before they both fell through a black hole, appearing in a quiet section of the ship that looked like someone\u2019s empty apartment, but made of stone. The ceiling lights were burning red color that reminded (Y/N) of the Red Light District in Amsterdam. Not her first choice in a place to stay, but it would do.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou just thought to use that now?\u201d Gamora accused (Y/N) immediately which made her fold her arms defensively.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you just recently decided to turn against <i>that</i> clusterfuck?\u201d (Y/N) bit back which made Gamora shake her head, silently agreeing with her.\u00a0\u201cBesides, if you really do know where this Vormir place is, then why the fuck would you get close enough to him to get captured? Didn\u2019t think to screw off to some no-name galaxy and wipe away any traces of your existence? Probably would\u2019ve helped the rest of us!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHypocritical much?\u201d Gamora growled back.\u00a0\u201cBringing the Power Stone to Thanos because your pride outweighs your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) considered Gamora for a moment, then nodded her head and extended her hand to her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFair enough,\u201d (Y/N) acquiesced as Gamora accepted her hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe won\u2019t get anywhere if we fight each other, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAgreed. Do you know where we are now?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Gamora hummed as she walked to the window, peering past the curtains into the ship.\u00a0\u201cWest Wing. We need to get to Section 47 that houses all the ships. The only problem is that it\u2019s probably already flooded with guards, so\u2026is there any way you could transport us off of the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI just found out that I could do this shit today. Not exactly an expert, yet,\u201d (Y/N) huffed, trying to calm down the panic that was rising inside of her.\u00a0\u201cWhat if you described it to me, this Section 47. Maybe, I could transport us there if I had an image in my head\u2026and hopefully not transport us straight into space where we suffocate and die,\u201d (Y/N) rambled nervously as she peered out the window as well to see a large cavern that was completely void of life, only blue flickering lights cast an eerie image on the cold, stone walls.\u00a0\u201cI mean unless you can think of some other way to get us out of here that wouldn\u2019t involve the risk of moonwalking to our graves?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving without my sister,\u201d Gamora stated.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOr risk\u2026wait, what?\u201d (Y/N) asked numbly, not really believing what she had just heard.\u00a0\u201cDid you just say\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe mentioned my sister. I won\u2019t leave without her,\u201d Gamora insisted again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Y/N) whisper-screamed, slamming the curtains shut as she began to pace in front of Gamora.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAbout wanting to help my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, about being an idiot!\u201d (Y/N) argued back, then calmed herself down again, running her hands through her hair.\u00a0\u201cHow the hell do you even know he has her? All he said was that you shouldn\u2019t disappoint her, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, maybe that \u2018whatever\u2019 is the part where you missed that he obviously has her. That was his threat to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExactly! Let\u2019s not let that threat work!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you have a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEven if I did, we\u2019re not playing this dumbass empathy game. I\u2019m not going back, and you\u2019re not either, so let me ask a better question? Do you want to be the reason that half the Universe will die? No? Didn\u2019t think so. Now, what are we thinking? Steal a ship and Hans Solo it out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour references mean nothing to me!\u201d Gamora whispered harshly back at (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cAnd I know what I\u2019m risking. My sister has made\u2026mistakes in her past, but she is still my sister. Just thinking about what Thanos will do to her if I leave her here\u2026she was always a pawn to him, just like me and everyone else. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll let her live this time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) watched Gamora intently, Gamora\u2019s own eyes never leaving (Y/N)\u2019s face. This was something that she wanted, and if she was anything like Thanos, she was going to get it. Unintentionally, (Y/N)\u2019s mind reeled back to her brother clutching at her hand before he was shot in their childhood home, his promises of safety echoing in her mind before she shook herself out of it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no, No, nO, NO, and did I mention no?\u201d (Y/N) spluttered out.\u00a0\u201cI know how hard this must be, but you have to think logically. You have information that Thanos can\u2019t have. I\u2019m just being honest here, but there\u2019s a 50/50 chance that your sister wouldn\u2019t even make it out alive after \u2018the snap\u2019\u00a0anyway, but at least in this scenario, you and I don\u2019t have to get captured. Here\u2019s a weapon. Now, let\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d (Y/N) commanded, taking Steve\u2019s tone that seemed to break Gamora for a second as she took the katana from (Y/N), but the moment didn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet me rephrase, then\u2026I can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Gamora whispered.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at the things you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLike leave you here on this ship without a way off of it?\u201d Gamora threatened which made (Y/N) put her hand dramatically to her chest.\u00a0\u201cLook, I know the way out of here and how to fly a ship. Can you do either of those things?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026won\u2019t know until I try it. And I\u2019m always up for new opportunities to put on my job resume when this superheroing comes to an end,\u201d (Y/N) responded sarcastically,\u00a0narrowing her eyes at Gamora who was still watching her intently, crossed arms glued to her chest.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t do this! I\u00a0have to get home!\u201d (Y/N) exclaimed.\u00a0\u201cI have people wating for me, people I need to protect. I\u2019m sorry about your sister, if she\u2019s even here, but I have people of my own! I\u2019m not screwing over my chance to be with them again just because you have a\u00a0\u2018hunch\u2019 that Thanos has her. I\u2019m sorry, but this is ridiculous. We are halfway to escaping and you\u2019re willing to give that up? No. Nope. No way. There\u2019s not a chance in hell that you\u2019re gonna convince me to go back for a suicide mission.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u00a0 A few minutes later\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHow <i>the fuck</i> did you convince me to come back here?\u201d (Y/N) whispered, still in shock at the stupid decision she had made as she forced a frozen guard between the wall behind where Nebula was strung up by some kind of gravitational pull.\u00a0(Y/N) and Gamora had been on their way to a smaller ship dock that Gamora figured would be easier to infiltrate, but as they were getting closer, they had heard the piercing screams of a woman that raked down (Y/N)\u2019s spine like nails.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>\u201cWell\u2026that could be anyone,\u201d</i> (Y/N) had posited before Gamora forced them both to take a detour into Thanos\u2019s supposed torture chamber. Now, Gamora was attempting to figure out the mechanics of releasing Nebula while (Y/N) took care of the guard\u2019s <i>possibly</i> dead bodies. She didn\u2019t know and definitely didn\u2019t care enough to find out.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Just as Gamora began to crack the code, the walls to the chamber began to open which scared the absolute hell out of (Y/N), her body frozen to the spot. In a rush, Gamora hissed at (Y/N) to hide as she stood to face her father, her body poised defensively in front of the blue-toned woman hovering mid-air, the mechanical pieces of her body floating away from each other to leave her body disjointed, her torso unconnected from her head, arm not attached to her shoulder, and so on. It was\u2026ungodly\u2026like nothing (Y/N) had ever seen before, even in her years locked inside of Hydra, the torture capital of Earth.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to,\u201d Gamora insisted through gritted teeth to (Y/N), knowing that there was nothing (Y/N) could do to argue as Thanos\u2019s shadow appeared beyond the realm of the chamber.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd so she returns,\u201d Thanos boasted, knowing his threat had worked.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot for you,\u201d Gamora deadpanned.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI thought as much,\u201d Thanos responded, taking a seat on the stoop in front of the chamber, facing away from Nebula as he patted the section next to him for Gamora to sit. She stood a few feet in front of him instead, back turned to him as she watched the murky black water ebb and flow as it always had for twenty years. Twenty goddamned, miserable years. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me (Y/N) left so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe left me to fend for myself. She thought only one of us should risk capture,\u201d Gamora grumbled bitterly as (Y/N) squeezed her way through the opening in the wall to the tablet that Gamora had been punching in codes, glancing up to see the robot-girl from a closer angle, the view even more ghastly up close. The woman\u2019s eyes were frozen open in a state of shock, unblinking. Hopefully, she couldn\u2019t feel any of the horrible things that were happening to her, but (Y/N) knew better. Even when her attention turned to the control panel, Nebula\u2019s petrified eyes still haunted (Y/N)\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u00a0 The conversation between Thanos and Gamora ranged from hateful words to promises of family, to even more hateful words, until (Y/N) heard this bullshit:</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cInteresting\u2026is that why she\u2019s stressing over the control system to free your sister?\u201d Thanos accused, turning his head to watch (Y/N)\u2019s head flip up to his, her eyes wide at being caught as she began to furiously bang at the tablet until it hit the ground with the crack of glass and fizzle of a dying car battery, herself blowing the wisps of hair out of her face in frustration.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know what, you should really consider making this thing more user-friendly,\u201d (Y/N) accused back as Gamora rolled her eyes. Even Nebula\u2019s was able to let out an annoyed sigh. \u201cI actually know a great tech guy. Stark Industries. Could get this shit sorted out in minutes,\u201d (Y/N) offered rapidly just as one of the guards fell from her ice prison with a dull smack like a drunken Death Eater on the metal flooring.\u00a0\u201cHe was like that when I got here-\u201d (Y/N) proclaimed, but her voice was choked out of her throat as Thanos wielded his gauntlet, bringing her closer to him in rows of red chains that tightened around her body the more she tried to struggle out of them.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChildren,\u201d Thanos grumbled lowly as he looked down on Gamora. \u201cI\u00a0never taught you to lie\u2026that\u2019s why you\u2019re so bad at it,\u201d Thanos hissed at her, then turned his attention to (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cAnd I thought better of you. <i>Expected</i> more of you. An open mind and more common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean, thought that was a pretty good run\u2026considering,\u201d (Y/N) croaked out, her midsection being strangled by the anaconda-like pressure.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Thanos enunciated darkly, leaving Gamora to lower her head behind him as he approached (Y/N), his tongue ticking at her as he placed a finger under her chin.\u00a0\u201cI suppose now is the time to enforce some harsher discipline, seeing as you cannot seem to control yourself.\u201d (Y/N) yanked her face away from Thanos, her eyes glowing deathly white, far past her usual silver. She caught sight of Gamora mouthing something to her, but (Y/N) couldn\u2019t make it out as\u00a0Thanos\u2019s fist opened and closed, his fingertips beginning to burn with blue energy that (Y/N) recognized as the space stone.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMind control,\u201d (Y/N) scoffed.\u00a0\u201cAnd I thought I asked for some creativity.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhatever it takes to get the job done,\u201d Thanos grinned just as he aimed his fist for (Y/N)\u2019s face.\u00a0\u201cAnything more to add?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026burn in hell,\u201d (Y/N) snarled, making Thanos cock his head, a wicked grin splitting his face as the blue aura became a raging fire,\u00a0but Gamora grabbed his arm at the last moment to point at her instead.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, distracting him just as (Y/N) broke free from her bondage, charging Thanos, but he rounded on her, the palm of his other hand meeting the center of her forehead that made her eyes roll into the back of her head. All those years in yoga and this was the first time that she actually felt her third eye open up\u2026or maybe that was the splitting of her skull. Either way, a rapid-fire projection show of images from her past surfaced in her mind too quick for her to focus on one embarrassing moment at a time. Outside of her mind, time seemed to be frozen as her limp body floated among the blue magic that forced Gamora to fly and hit her back against a stone wall where she crumpled to the ground. She tried to fight the force, but it was too much. The Infinity Stone would\u2019ve killed her, just like everyone else in the Universe except for one\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Moments passed under the Space Stone\u2019s spell until (Y/N) hit the ground in a runner\u2019s stance, now shrouded in a <a href=\"http://rowan-and-rhysand-trash.tumblr.com/post/145800346769/swords-are-boring-indeed-aelin-galathynius\">black cloak</a>\u00a0with silver detailing laced around the edges like frost in the night, battle armor adorning her figure as her hair fell like a veil of death over her face. Taking a few breaths, she finally rose, eyes snapping open to meet Thanos\u2019s, but all she could see were shadows in a sea of blue haze. She had no idea what was going on until she felt her own cold, broken lips begin to move, mind not in control of her own actions.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMaster, I am here to serve, \u201d her voice hollowly contended as she felt her left knee kiss the cold metal ground, her head lowering in a bow of respect.</p><p>\u00a0 She was trapped inside of her own body.</p><p>\u00a0 Desperately, her mind demanded her limbs to obey her, to fight back, to kill the bastard who was dead set to kill almost everyone she loved and cared for, but she was helpless to the spell. And with the gruesome realization of her unwilling obedience to the Mad Titan himself, the darkness overcame her.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYUJMbc4I2mRJul-C-Rv_7w\">@fanaticwritings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5HZ3U1t8DOK0pLeTjKskg\">@inumorph</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myqn4ifHH58bObOtyht1FSQ\">@dawn121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN9DldOxAXGIUkDC3VjZmxg\">@bubbleteaproduction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miiBX34jw1Mz_9yBxwbM8FA\">@deanskitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc3YhKa0nQ6C5c50zMTXYA\">@shamvictoria11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz6K1NOqNRuKlsKl705UBJw\">@maybeiamamermaid</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a></p><p><a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/148438393715/the-ultimate-masterlist\">MASTERLIST</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/174735659745/chapter-1-the-orb-avengers-x-femreader\">Chapter 1</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175071067210/chapter-2-currently-fearing-the-reaper-avengers\">Chapter 2</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175400908850/chapter-3-earth-is-closed-today-avengers-x\">Chapter 3</a></p><p>*please follow and let me know if you\u2019d like to be tagged.

(Y/N)!\u201d Tony called out, his voice straining from the tightness of his throat, blood and tears mixing on his wounded skin, but he needed to find her. It was a gnawing urge that forced his buried panic to resurface like a weight on his chest. Once more, he let his person slip between his fingertips, and once again he realized that no one could hate him as much as he hated himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Strange cut in, but Tony was inconsolable, himself beginning to search further inside Ebony Maw\u2019s\u00a0ship, the creatures dead body still lying where (Y/N) had stabbed him.\u00a0\u201cStark, there\u2019s no use. She\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t lose her! Not again. (Y/N)!\u201d Tony countered, trying to convince himself more than Strange, but he knew at this moment that he had lost it. Tony continued to pace, calling out her name until Peter stepped in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMr. Stark, we\u2026we haven\u2019t lost her, yet,\u201d Peter coaxed quietly, making Tony lock his jaw.\u00a0\u201cYou know (Y/N). If anything, I\u2019d be nervous for Thanos. I\u2019m not really happy about it, but doing what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t really helping either\u2026sir.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat? Screaming her name into the void isn\u2019t helping?\u201d Tony joked back, his heart not really in it, but understood Peter\u2019s point\u00a0as he patted him on the shoulder.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re on the right track, kid\u2026she was right about you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTouching moment, you two,\u201d Strange interjected impatiently, seeing as to how Tony\u2019s panic attack had now passed\u2026mostly. \u201cBut finding her isn\u2019t the priority now. If it really is Thanos who has her, then I\u2019m sure wherever he is, she\u2019ll be. Titan is still our best option.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDid you lose your emotions during a wizarding accident, or something?\u201d Tony accused, but Strange ignored his jab, instead watching the oncoming planet that their ship was headed straight towards, the impact imminent.</p><p>\u00a0 Walking by Tony, Peter made one last comment.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) has never given up on anything. We shouldn\u2019t either,\u201d Peter proposed as he made his way towards the helm of the ship. Tony, in that moment, had never been more proud of Peter. The kid still had so much potential. So much.</p><p>\u00a0 But reality hit him straight in the face when he witnessed the barren wasteland they were about to crash into. With any luck, wherever (Y/N) was, it was better than dealing with this shit.</p><hr><p>READER\u2019S\u00a0POV</p><p>\u00a0 Maybe, (Y/N) had finally lost her mind. Maybe, today should be the day that she gives in to her psychosis. To be free of reality, and live by the flow that life leads for her to follow, taking it one bare, naked footstep through the flower field at a time. Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? To just let go. Wouldn\u2019t that just be the dream? A lustful, 1970\u2032s\u00a0Stevie Nicks, acid-tripping, peaceful-protesting, flower-powering fantasy? <i>Fantasy</i> being the key word.</p><p>\u00a0 The colors faded in and out of focus, melding together in powdered smoke that rose deep inside her mind\u2019s eye. The closer she reached to consciousness, the more violent the colors became. The more the dust became the fire shot from a gun, bullets piercing her brain with each flash of hair-raising vibrancy. A shock. A bang. An explosion. A chaotic warfare forcing a battering ram into the doors of her psyche that were locked tight around the barriers of her awareness, but the wood was splintering and the fires were igniting. They were burning red hot into a lick of yellow, transforming into the spindly fingers of a wicked green, contorting into a ball of raging blue that scorched her into consciousness with a sharp yelp that evaporated into the humid air.</p><p>\u00a0 Deep inhales were all her body could manage as a cold sweat trickled down her spine to overcompensate the burning sensation that continued to blister her skin. The abrupt awakening sparked her eyes with a newfound urgency and arrow-point accuracy as they searched the dark, damp cavern that she found herself in, the view beyond the metal beams that trapped her as ancient as time itself. The best way to describe her predicament would be to say that she was a bird trapped in a cage, feeling the weight of herself and the chair she was strapped to not firm on solid ground, but rather levitating by the fiery blue energy that had shocked her from her dream, it\u2019s poisonous tendrils wrapping themselves around her bare toes that prickled with sleep. The faint drips of something liquid and the far-off echoes of bangs of the inner-working of a metallic ship caught her attention as she felt another person\u2019s presence suck the air from her lungs.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Not knowing the entity would yet to cease her tounge.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI hope you have more than some handcuffs and a few metal bars to intimidate me, becuase if you think this is the first time I\u2019ve been in this situation, then you don\u2019t realize how kinky I can really get,\u201d (Y/N) panted out more confidently than her body could manage, just barely lifting up her head enough to see through the wild hair that mangled her vision, hoping to size up her captor.\u00a0\u201cHonestly, hit me with your best shot. I\u2019m looking for the full production. Entertainment at it\u2019s fucking finest.\u00a0Really inspire me here. I\u2019m asking for torture creativity\u2026\u201d she ranted until she finally caught sight of her captor through the shadows, his figure looming ominously just beyond the edge of the water-filled chasm she was perched above, and wow. She was not ready.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour petulance astounds me, child. You\u2019re much more brazen than even I had anticipated through my years of watching you grow,\u201d her captor announced, his massive body somehow more intense than even Hulk to match. But what really caught her attention (besides the thing that was growing on his chin that she soon realized was just his chin) was his voice. The voice from her dream.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>Thanos</i>. And as much as she hated to admit it, the name and recognition of his identity alone dropped her heart into the pit of her stomach with a dull thud. It wasn\u2019t just his size, but the way he stood and commanded the room. There was no trace of doubt. He knew what he wanted and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he wouldn\u2019t do to get it. Years of patience had brought him this far, and he had finally decided that he had mastered his craft. It was less from his words that she perceived this, but from his eyes that were more than dark, but focused. Focused on one path, and one alone.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 It was one he shared with her own father.</p><p>\u00a0 But she recovered quickly, dragging her eyes like claws in the dirt to focus on his, despite the guttural instinct inside of her that screamed at her ragdoll limbs to tuck themselves into a ball and hide. But that instinct was buried with the rest of her fear, locked tight inside a box next to the other box that, apparently, held her will to live.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re a lot more purple than I thought you would be,\u201d (Y/N) responded apathetically. \u201cGuess, we both got an unwelcomed surprise today.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI disagree,\u201d Thanos countered patiently.\u00a0\u201cYou are enthusiasically welcomed on my ship. More welcome than possibly anyone here, in fact. My hope lies in your willingness to give great thought and action to what I am told the late Ebony has evoked upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHow \u2018bout, instead, I give you a fresh basket of <i>go fuck yourself</i>, and we both go off on our happy, merry ways. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, she was jerked forward, gripping the edges of her chair with her chipped nails as the cage hovered towards Thanos, his fist balled in a golden, Hamburger Helper glove that willed her to him. Regaining her composure, she held Thanos\u2019 glare, matching his intensity as she neared his unusually scarred and cratered face that reminded her of a Grand Canyon on an alien planet that nobody would ever want to visit.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t forget that you\u2019re the one in the cage,\u201d Thanos threatened as the tendrils wrapped around her ankles, but she kicked them off with a scoff.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAll the more reason to prove that you\u2019re terrified of me,\u201d she purred through a smirk as she watched Thanos\u2019 frown deepen.\u00a0\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t think you can control me otherwise? Becuase on this one thing, you\u2019d be right\u2026but just so we\u2019re clear, everything else you\u2019re preaching is a complete bust and, ultimately going to fail. It didn\u2019t work for Hitler, so what makes you so special?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPetty how you only see the Universe through the lens of your own planet and it\u2019s many\u00a0downfalls when there are so many beings, too many beings, for you to even comprehend.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, good morning, Mr. High and Mighty. Maybe, I should introduce you to Humility sometime. Guess since you\u2019re deep-fisting a few Infinity Stones, you now think you have all the answers then, don\u2019t you? This just in, buddy,\u201d (Y/N) dared, the fear creeping into her throat, but she shoved it back down, focusing on her words rather than her emotions as she tugged at the Power Stone that, surprisingly, still hung around her neck.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got one too. Which begs the question: why? You\u2019ve got me locked in this cage <i>with</i> the stone, instead of dead and without it. You say you\u2019ve got this master plan, but so far, I\u2019m not putting the pieces together here, so maybe\u2026\u201d (Y/N) paused her rant for a moment, closing her eyes to take a breath to calm herself down, a plan of her own hatching in her brain that wasn\u2019t her typical style, but a means to an end\u2026\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Her eyes flickered up to Thanos\u2019s once more, her head cocked to the side in question which peeked his interest.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGo on,\u201d Thanos prodded.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut maybe because I haven\u2019t gotten the full story, yet,\u201d she wondered aloud.\u00a0\u201cAll I\u2019ve heard about you sounds straight out of a legend from the mouths of people you\u2019d either just threatened, or hired. Maybe I haven\u2019t heard your side of the story yet and since you\u2019ve so stupidly allowed me to live this long, I take it you probably want to share it with me. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cVery intuitive,\u201d Thanos grinned as he took a seat on his throne, waving the chains away from (Y/N)\u2019s wrists and ankles, allowing her the opportunity to lounge in her own chair\u00a0that felt like a broken lawn chair in comparison to his, but she never wavered in her confidence.\u00a0\u201cBut I must ask: what changed your mind so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Thanos drawled as he began to relax, taking note of his prisoner\u2019s false face that she wore, so familiar to the one his daughter had worn in the years before her betrayal. The one that had led to her being knocked out at the foot of his throne while he took the opportuity to interrogate his new and improved right-hand in peace.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBefore we start your therapy session, maybe we talk about the poor soul you have sniffing your toes first?\u201d (Y/N) asked, her empathy well-masked, yet unmistakable to Thanos which made his mouth twitch into a tight-lipped grin.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll get to her,\u201d he mused, making (Y/N) lift an eyebrow and hold her hands up defensively, motioning for him to begin.\u00a0\u201cGrowing up, my home planet of Titan was constantly on the brink of collapse from famine, disease, and war. Every day was a struggle. It was in that time watching my people starve that I came up with the idea to balance the population. To kill half of the people in order for my planet to flourish in their wake. Random, of course. The rich, the poor, and whoever in between. Chaos into balance. All for the rest of my planet to become happy and healthy for centuries to come. To finally be able to live.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, you know what they say about chaos?\u201d (Y/N) sighed, quoting Heath Ledger\u2019s, the Joker.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI had a feeling that you were right for the job,\u201d Thanos smiled in approval, making (Y/N) smile to herself.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d (Y/N) mused, wondering if she should point out Thanos\u2019s connection to, in her opinion, one of the greatest villains of all-time, but thought better of it in order to keep up with her plan to keep the peace.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos watched her face carefully, but she remained neutral, only nodding after her comment as she waited for him to continue.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cSo desperately did they crave salvation, a solution to their inevitable demise, yet when I offered them one\u2026\u201d Thanos recalled darkly, shaking his head in disapproval,\u00a0\u201cthey called me a Madman. And once my planet turned to ruins, I knew that I had been right. And now, here we are. So many planets so close to extinction, so many people suffering when the solution is right here with me. I refuse to allow another waste of a civilization.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut if your problem is a starving population, why not use the stones to provide a meal a day to those who need it? Snap, and there\u2019s a Thanksgiving dinner for half the world sitting on their table.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut genocide is?\u201d (Y/N) countered, but quickly realized his mind had been set for decades. His expression was immovable, so (Y/N) changed her tone.\u00a0\u201cHow are you so sure that this would work?\u201d (Y/N) asked calmly.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t my first time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 That shocked (Y/N), and there was no way that she could hide it. She suddenly got a glimpse of the slaughtering of millions, blood, gore, and death. Bodies stacked upon bodies. Something out of Chainsaw Massacre. Something like she had experienced in Hydra. How has he not been stopped, yet? Or, at least, had she never heard of him before? This seems like a major issue that should have been addressed ages ago.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSurprised? So was she,\u201d Thanos grinned, gazing down at the woman on the ground beneath him, her jade-hued fingers beginning to twitch. He cocked his head to the side.\u00a0\u201cMaybe she should be the one to tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Closing his fist, a flash of blue light erupted from his glove as the woman\u2019s eyes shot open in a panic, herself standing up to address her attacker as she drew her sword. Her hyperventilation filled the room until her eyes landed on Thanos, her hatred pure and unforgiving as she started towards him only to have her weapon dissipate in a flurry of bubbles just as it reached Thanos\u2019s neck. The woman flew backwards to land on the ground in front of (Y/N)\u2019s cage, hitting her head against the bars that had finally landed on the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Had to admit, (Y/N) was impressed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou brought me back here?\u201d She snarled at Thanos as she stood.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere else would I take you, Daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDaughter?\u201d (Y/N) choked out. Both Thanos and his, apparently, daughter turned on her.\u00a0\u201cSorry, you just don\u2019t really seem like the, uh\u2026fatherly type.\u201d<br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHardly. And he\u2019s not my father,\u201d the woman growled back at Thanos.\u00a0\u201cSo,\u00a0now you have a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not a prisoner,\u201d Thanos explained casually.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean, I kind of feel like a prisoner,\u201d (Y/N) shrugged as she tapped the bars with her fingernails.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOnly until I have your full cooperation, Little One,\u201d Thanos mused, his lips pulling into a sneer as his daughter tensed. She hung her head low, avoiding his eye contact, but the guilt and self-loathing was clear in her face. (Y/N) wasn\u2019t sure why, but this seemed like a very personal blow from Thanos.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo this is why you took her? To replace me?\u201d The woman accused, narrowing her eyes at Thanos who still had his lips curled.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHardly,\u201d he responded coldly, echoing his daughter\u2019s words.\u00a0\u201cShe is much more powerful than even you were, and the only one that will be able to retrieve the Infinity Stone that I need. Something you were unable to do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 This grabbed his daughter\u2019s attention, her eyes finally meeting his as he towered directly over her.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I disappointed you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u00a0 Thanos let out another disapproving sigh as he leaned closer to her.\u00a0\u201cI am disappointed,\u201d he stated, taking a strand of her wavy red hair.\u00a0\u201cAnd not becuase you didn\u2019t find it, but because you did. And you lied.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 The tension hung in the air as they both sized each other up, Thanos not wanting to hurt his daughter, and her probably wanting to hurt him, but knowing that she couldn\u2019t. (Y/N) finally decided to step in.\u00a0\u201cUh, not that I\u2019m not fully entertained by your family drama and wouldn\u2019t invest in a Keeping Up With the Infinity Stones, but\u2026this seems like a very personal matter. Should I\u2026maybe step out, or\u2026? Becuase it seems like you two have some things to work out here-\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d the woman insisted.\u00a0\u201cI know exactly where I stand.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, Gamora,\u201d Thanos sighed.\u00a0\u201cHow you continue to disappoint me. But my question is, would you dare to disappoint your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a sister, too?\u201d (Y/N) exclaimed, Thanos and Gamora glared at her again.\u00a0\u201cLike I said, should I step outside?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Thanos denied, focusing his attention on (Y/N) now which she suddenly regretted as Thanos began to encircle her like a shark sniffing out his next meal.\u00a0\u201cBut what I do want is for you to give me your final thoughts on the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) let out a laugh, leaning back in her chair again.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I would if you told me exactly what you wanted me to do in this whole <i>plan </i>of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Gamora\u2019s face cringed in disgust at (Y/N)\u2019s words, confused as to why this random girl would even consider his cruelty. Who the hell was she?</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d Thanos smiled as he turned his back on her to return to his throne, beginning his explanation as he walked. In those seconds, (Y/N) gained Gamora\u2019s attention and mouthed, <i>we have to work together</i>, widening her eyes hoping that Gamora understood. At first, Gamora seemed to distrust (Y/N), but quickly realized that the girl was in a cage, so Thanos obviously didn\u2019t trust her. Which made her the perfect ally.\u00a0\u201cAs I mentioned before, I have watched you grow from afar. Ever since you came in contact with the Orb, my interest in you has grown. You\u2019ve been through so much, child, seen so much. You have witnessed the worst of humanity, the places in which resources are limited and want is plentiful, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d (Y/N) responded, letting the emotions of what she had experienced during her days on the streets consume her. Look, if she wanted Thanos to trust her, she really had to sell it.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is one reason why I have chosen you. I think that you, of all people, will understand my vision. The assistance that may be offered to those in need.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd the other reason you chose me?\u201d (Y/N) prodded, ignoring his failed logic.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour connection with the Vision.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, you already said that,\u201d (Y/N) contended after a moment, making Thanos frown. And that was not a pretty sight.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, child. <i>The</i> Vision. The keeper of the Mind Stone,\u201d Thanos explained further as (Y/N) did an awkward, <i>ohhhhh, right, </i>taking full responsibility of her own failed logic.\u00a0\u201cYes, you know him well.\u201d (Y/N) cocked her head to the side.\u00a0\u201cWell enough, then,\u201d Thanos corrected.\u00a0\u201cWhat I need from you is to take the stone from him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) froze. No more jokes. This got much more serious in an instant. Yes, aiding Thanos in any way would be disgusting and wrong, but to actually be the one to, not only <i>take</i> the stone, but to be the one to take Vision\u2019s life? To kill the only person, besides maybe herself, that has come anywhere close to the relationship that Wanda had with her brother? Yeah, no. She had to get the fuck out of there, pronto.</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) scoffed, still maintaining her neutrality.\u00a0\u201cSo, you think that becuase I\u2019m friends with Vision, that that would make it easier to assassinate him?\u201d (Y/N) questioned.\u00a0\u201cYeah, that makes perfect sense.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA small price to pay,\u201d Thanos proclaimed as (Y/N) made a face.\u00a0\u201cYour relationship will allow you to get close to him and take the stone before he can defend himself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo betray his trust?\u201d (Y/N) broke in.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNow you understand,\u201d Thanos smiled (didn\u2019t think anything could be worse than the frowing, but she was wrong). (Y/N) shook her head, completely miffed by this dude\u2019s departure from sanity and lack of humanity. She was right. There wasn\u2019t anything that he wouldn\u2019t do, and no biting comment she would make was going to change that. Acceptance, whether it was real or not, would be her only way out.\u00a0\u201cAll you need to do is give me the Mind Stone, then this can all be over as soon as it started. Then, the Universe can truly begin to renew itself.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis <i>has</i> gone by insanely quick,\u201d (Y/N) whispered in awe (that wasn\u2019t entirely disingenuous), thinking that just a few hours ago she was back on Earth watching pigeons cage match over some road-kill hot dog from the window of a wizard\u2019s lair. She looked up to Thanos.\u00a0\u201cYou really do believe in this?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow could you even think of doing this?\u201d Gamora yelled at her, charging her cell.\u00a0\u201cI know that I don\u2019t know you, but this can\u2019t be something that you want! The pain and suffering that my planet felt after he came and destroyed it remains. Yes, there may be more resources to go around, but we will never forgive what we lost or forget who we lost. Never.\u201d By the end, Gamora had tears streaming down her cheeks, anger boiling over. Her pain was tangible, squeezing (Y/N)\u2019s own stomach at the thought of her own friends and family\u2026</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut this is just one generation,\u201d (Y/N) argued back, leaving Gamora speechless and bringing Thanos to lean closer in anticipation to her next words, his elbows resting on his knees.\u00a0\u201cOnce this generation has passed, and those who had to deal with the agony have come and gone, all you have left is the good that has come out of your father\u2019s plan. I\u2019m sure, whether you know it or not, some people now have already found gratefulness in what he\u2019s done\u2026and I think that I would be among them,\u201d (Y/N) concluded thoughtfully, throwing a knowing look to Thanos who studied her closely.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose everything,\u201d Gamora swore, and that\u2019s where (Y/N) let out a dark laugh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLosing loved ones is old news for me,\u201d (Y/N) dismissed.\u00a0\u201cOnce you get through the hurricane, there\u2019s always a way come back from the destruction. I watched my entire family die right in front of me, and I\u2019m still here. In fact, I\u2019ve made a new one of my own, and I can do it again.\u00a0If I can make it so others can live a life better than mine, I\u2019m all in.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 And in that moment, her cage dissolved in an array of shiny bubbles that reflected the shock in both (Y/N)\u2019s and Gamora\u2019s expressions. Thanos barely lifted a finger, his arms still resting on his throne that were carved in what resembled crocodile skin. Fitting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFinally\u2026a worthy ally. Welcome to the Black Order, (Y/N), my newfound pride and glory,\u201d Thanos announced as (Y/N) did an awkward curtsy thing that she didn\u2019t even understand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, really, but uh,\u00a0I hope I can first ask\u2026\u201d (Y/N) began, putting a slight shake into her voice which seemed to please Thanos greatly as he smiled down to her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf course you may,\u201d Thanos allowed as (Y/N) nodded with a shy smile.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhere exactly are we?\u201d (Y/N) asked, suppressing a laugh when she heard Gamora grumble about her\u00a0\u2018own personal hellscape.\u2019\u00a0\u201cMaybe near somewhere that I know like Sakaar, or Xandar, or\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cXandar has already been destroyed,\u201d Thanos interrupted, a bragging tone entering his voice as (Y/N)\u2019s own faltered with a small,<i> oh</i>.\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about them. Their planet was doomed from the very beginning. Have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cNo, I uh\u2026I\u2019ve just heard stories.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cIf you had been, I promise that you would have seen it\u2019s uselessness. However,\u00a0I found fragments of the Orb there,\u201d Thanos explained, revealing one of the sockets on his glove to be halfway filled with a piece of amethyst light,\u00a0\u201cbut once I discovered the rest of the stone\u2019s\u00a0transfer to Asgard, I knew, not only of Xandar\u2019s time to be decimated, but that\u00a0Loki would be the perfect option to reunite you with the stone. Why you ever decided to part ways with it to begin with, I shall never fully understand. You were one of the fiercest warriors I had ever seen. I suppose now I shall make you so once more.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLoki? How did you\u2026?\u201d (Y/N) questioned (ignoring his comment about \u2018once\u2019 being the fiercest, since she was still the fiercest, so fuck him) as she slowly put the pieces together.\u00a0\u201cNew York. You were already in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s quite persistent when he wants to be,\u201d Thanos complimented.\u00a0\u201cBut his lack of conviction is repulsive. His use had quickly worn thin.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHad?\u201d (Y/N) choked out, her voice so small from the tightness that grew inside her throat.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you cared for him? After his attempt to take control of your planet?\u201d Thanos chided her which just\u2026she had to swallow down,\u00a0\u2018<i>then what the hell are you doing?</i>\u2019 And\u00a0\u2018<i>but you were the one who sent him to Earth</i>,\u2019 to instead take a moment to gather more intel about her surroundings. She found a few ways to escape, but only one really stood out to her.\u00a0\u201cBut returning to your primary question, we are just outside of Knowhere. Pitiful place, alas it is where I found, not only the Reality Stone, but my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd she\u2019s ever so grateful,\u201d Gamora murmured coldly with her arms crossed over her chest. She was more like (Y/N) than she could even know. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDaughter, you continue to forget your once shared loyalty to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat was before I knew I had a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you chose wrong,\u201d Thanos growled as he leaned towards Gamora again.\u00a0\u201cWhere is the Soul Stone?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gamora demanded, gritting her teeth.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, come on,\u201d (Y/N) scoffed, rolling her eyes which surprised both Gamora and Thanos.\u00a0\u201cI mean, he\u2019s going to get it out of you, so just bite the bullet on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d Gamora shot back, making (Y/N) sigh.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not as good an actress as you think, and he\u2019s got two and a half Infinity Stones while you have none. It\u2019s common sense, really.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou heard her,\u201d Thanos rumbled, throwing an appreciatory glance at (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cOut with it, Gamora. If not, you know that I have other methods of making you talk. And I wouldn\u2019t want to have to crush you when all you have to do is give me a name.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 Suddenly, there was a small burst of giggling that floated in the air. Thanos wrinkled up his face as he found the source in (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d he demanded at her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d (Y/N) sighed, waving him off.\u00a0\u201cI guess it\u2019s just funny because\u2026I was thinking the same thing,\u201d she finished with a smirk as she twisted her hand at her side and the last crack in the stalactite above Thanos\u2019s head hurtled it\u2019s way towards himself and Gamora. (Y/N) used her right hand to pull Gamora away from the damage, the woman sliding on the ground towards (Y/N) as she used her left hand to force Thanos to crash into his throne, having used the falling boulder as a distraction crushing his body with many crunches that were hopefully his bones, but she doubted it. (Y/N) reached down for Gamora\u2019s hand to pull her up as they both began to run towards the nearest exit.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI was going to wait a bit longer, but he really opened himself up for that one,\u201d (Y/N) laughed, nudging Gamora excitedly, but the woman was clearly in shock with some serious tunnel vision.\u00a0\u201cYou know your way around here right?\u201d (Y/N) called to Gamora who was overcoming her momentary whiplash, but quickly shook herself off, gearing herself into a war mentality.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately. This way, let\u2019s go!\u201d Gamora yelled back, but they both skidded to a stop when Thanos appeared in front of them just before they reached the exit, his image seeming to be unfolded from reality in a tear of red, himself shaking his head in disappointment.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou really believed that would stop me?\u201d Thanos reprimanded as (Y/N) handed Gamora an ice katana.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGotta admit, I kinda hoped so,\u201d (Y/N) taunted back, cracking her neck before she howled into her fight with Thanos, ice katanas wielded as she drove them towards his face, but she was swatted aside just as Gamora reached his calf with the hilt of her own sword. Bouncing off his skin which caused him to become unbalanced, allowing (Y/N) the opportunity to throw another boulder at him where he cascaded into the water with a tsunami of a wave.</p><p>\u00a0 Finding their opening, (Y/N) and Gamora bolted out of the throne room and into a stone-carved hallway, columns rising against the left side of the hallway that opened up to the throne room they had just left, Thanos\u2019s piercing roars echoing off the cavern walls around them like a subway tearing through a tunnel. After each pillar, (Y/N) could see Thanos\u2019s figure rising from the water until he spotted her as well. Thinking quickly, (Y/N) used the pillars to her advantage to hurl at him with her magic as she continued to run, the pillars alight in burning purple magic as they attacked Thanos, knocking him back with each blow until the women veered off to the right and away from the throne room entirely, (Y/N) following Gamora as she knocked aside Black Order members. (Y/N) joined her in the fight as more crowded the hallways.</p><p>\u00a0 It was soon that both women realized that they were right in deciding to become allies because they worked wonders together. Protecting each other\u2019s backs and finishing off a guard that the first one had started. It was very much for (Y/N) like fighting side-by-side with Nat, which she had to stop thinking about because it just reminded her that she wasn\u2019t home yet. But she would get there\u2026even if it killed her.</p><p>\u00a0 But everything came to a halt when Gamora pointed towards another hallway for them to escape through, (Y/N) rounding the corner first to almost have her head torn off by a boulder that Thanos threw that gouged a hole in the stone above her head as (Y/N) threw her arm across Gamora\u2019s chest to stop her from running, them both taking cover behind the wall.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIs this the only way to go?\u201d (Y/N) shouted.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFrom here, yes!\u201d Gamora responded in frustration, running through different tunnel variations in her head with no luck, but her words gave (Y/N) an idea. Taking Gamora\u2019s arm, (Y/N) focused her energy on the Orb which glowed before they both fell through a black hole, appearing in a quiet section of the ship that looked like someone\u2019s empty apartment, but made of stone. The ceiling lights were burning red color that reminded (Y/N) of the Red Light District in Amsterdam. Not her first choice in a place to stay, but it would do.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou just thought to use that now?\u201d Gamora accused (Y/N) immediately which made her fold her arms defensively.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you just recently decided to turn against <i>that</i> clusterfuck?\u201d (Y/N) bit back which made Gamora shake her head, silently agreeing with her.\u00a0\u201cBesides, if you really do know where this Vormir place is, then why the fuck would you get close enough to him to get captured? Didn\u2019t think to screw off to some no-name galaxy and wipe away any traces of your existence? Probably would\u2019ve helped the rest of us!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHypocritical much?\u201d Gamora growled back.\u00a0\u201cBringing the Power Stone to Thanos because your pride outweighs your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) considered Gamora for a moment, then nodded her head and extended her hand to her.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFair enough,\u201d (Y/N) acquiesced as Gamora accepted her hand.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe won\u2019t get anywhere if we fight each other, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAgreed. Do you know where we are now?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Gamora hummed as she walked to the window, peering past the curtains into the ship.\u00a0\u201cWest Wing. We need to get to Section 47 that houses all the ships. The only problem is that it\u2019s probably already flooded with guards, so\u2026is there any way you could transport us off of the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI just found out that I could do this shit today. Not exactly an expert, yet,\u201d (Y/N) huffed, trying to calm down the panic that was rising inside of her.\u00a0\u201cWhat if you described it to me, this Section 47. Maybe, I could transport us there if I had an image in my head\u2026and hopefully not transport us straight into space where we suffocate and die,\u201d (Y/N) rambled nervously as she peered out the window as well to see a large cavern that was completely void of life, only blue flickering lights cast an eerie image on the cold, stone walls.\u00a0\u201cI mean unless you can think of some other way to get us out of here that wouldn\u2019t involve the risk of moonwalking to our graves?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving without my sister,\u201d Gamora stated.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOr risk\u2026wait, what?\u201d (Y/N) asked numbly, not really believing what she had just heard.\u00a0\u201cDid you just say\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe mentioned my sister. I won\u2019t leave without her,\u201d Gamora insisted again.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat?!\u201d (Y/N) whisper-screamed, slamming the curtains shut as she began to pace in front of Gamora.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAbout wanting to help my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, about being an idiot!\u201d (Y/N) argued back, then calmed herself down again, running her hands through her hair.\u00a0\u201cHow the hell do you even know he has her? All he said was that you shouldn\u2019t disappoint her, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, maybe that \u2018whatever\u2019 is the part where you missed that he obviously has her. That was his threat to me.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExactly! Let\u2019s not let that threat work!\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you have a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEven if I did, we\u2019re not playing this dumbass empathy game. I\u2019m not going back, and you\u2019re not either, so let me ask a better question? Do you want to be the reason that half the Universe will die? No? Didn\u2019t think so. Now, what are we thinking? Steal a ship and Hans Solo it out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour references mean nothing to me!\u201d Gamora whispered harshly back at (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cAnd I know what I\u2019m risking. My sister has made\u2026mistakes in her past, but she is still my sister. Just thinking about what Thanos will do to her if I leave her here\u2026she was always a pawn to him, just like me and everyone else. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll let her live this time.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 (Y/N) watched Gamora intently, Gamora\u2019s own eyes never leaving (Y/N)\u2019s face. This was something that she wanted, and if she was anything like Thanos, she was going to get it. Unintentionally, (Y/N)\u2019s mind reeled back to her brother clutching at her hand before he was shot in their childhood home, his promises of safety echoing in her mind before she shook herself out of it.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo, no, No, nO, NO, and did I mention no?\u201d (Y/N) spluttered out.\u00a0\u201cI know how hard this must be, but you have to think logically. You have information that Thanos can\u2019t have. I\u2019m just being honest here, but there\u2019s a 50/50 chance that your sister wouldn\u2019t even make it out alive after \u2018the snap\u2019\u00a0anyway, but at least in this scenario, you and I don\u2019t have to get captured. Here\u2019s a weapon. Now, let\u2019s get the fuck out of here,\u201d (Y/N) commanded, taking Steve\u2019s tone that seemed to break Gamora for a second as she took the katana from (Y/N), but the moment didn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLet me rephrase, then\u2026I can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Gamora whispered.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at the things you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLike leave you here on this ship without a way off of it?\u201d Gamora threatened which made (Y/N) put her hand dramatically to her chest.\u00a0\u201cLook, I know the way out of here and how to fly a ship. Can you do either of those things?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026won\u2019t know until I try it. And I\u2019m always up for new opportunities to put on my job resume when this superheroing comes to an end,\u201d (Y/N) responded sarcastically,\u00a0narrowing her eyes at Gamora who was still watching her intently, crossed arms glued to her chest.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t do this! I\u00a0have to get home!\u201d (Y/N) exclaimed.\u00a0\u201cI have people wating for me, people I need to protect. I\u2019m sorry about your sister, if she\u2019s even here, but I have people of my own! I\u2019m not screwing over my chance to be with them again just because you have a\u00a0\u2018hunch\u2019 that Thanos has her. I\u2019m sorry, but this is ridiculous. We are halfway to escaping and you\u2019re willing to give that up? No. Nope. No way. There\u2019s not a chance in hell that you\u2019re gonna convince me to go back for a suicide mission.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u00a0 A few minutes later\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 \u201cHow <i>the fuck</i> did you convince me to come back here?\u201d (Y/N) whispered, still in shock at the stupid decision she had made as she forced a frozen guard between the wall behind where Nebula was strung up by some kind of gravitational pull.\u00a0(Y/N) and Gamora had been on their way to a smaller ship dock that Gamora figured would be easier to infiltrate, but as they were getting closer, they had heard the piercing screams of a woman that raked down (Y/N)\u2019s spine like nails.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>\u201cWell\u2026that could be anyone,\u201d</i> (Y/N) had posited before Gamora forced them both to take a detour into Thanos\u2019s supposed torture chamber. Now, Gamora was attempting to figure out the mechanics of releasing Nebula while (Y/N) took care of the guard\u2019s <i>possibly</i> dead bodies. She didn\u2019t know and definitely didn\u2019t care enough to find out.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 Just as Gamora began to crack the code, the walls to the chamber began to open which scared the absolute hell out of (Y/N), her body frozen to the spot. In a rush, Gamora hissed at (Y/N) to hide as she stood to face her father, her body poised defensively in front of the blue-toned woman hovering mid-air, the mechanical pieces of her body floating away from each other to leave her body disjointed, her torso unconnected from her head, arm not attached to her shoulder, and so on. It was\u2026ungodly\u2026like nothing (Y/N) had ever seen before, even in her years locked inside of Hydra, the torture capital of Earth.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to,\u201d Gamora insisted through gritted teeth to (Y/N), knowing that there was nothing (Y/N) could do to argue as Thanos\u2019s shadow appeared beyond the realm of the chamber.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd so she returns,\u201d Thanos boasted, knowing his threat had worked.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot for you,\u201d Gamora deadpanned.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI thought as much,\u201d Thanos responded, taking a seat on the stoop in front of the chamber, facing away from Nebula as he patted the section next to him for Gamora to sit. She stood a few feet in front of him instead, back turned to him as she watched the murky black water ebb and flow as it always had for twenty years. Twenty goddamned, miserable years. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me (Y/N) left so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShe left me to fend for myself. She thought only one of us should risk capture,\u201d Gamora grumbled bitterly as (Y/N) squeezed her way through the opening in the wall to the tablet that Gamora had been punching in codes, glancing up to see the robot-girl from a closer angle, the view even more ghastly up close. The woman\u2019s eyes were frozen open in a state of shock, unblinking. Hopefully, she couldn\u2019t feel any of the horrible things that were happening to her, but (Y/N) knew better. Even when her attention turned to the control panel, Nebula\u2019s petrified eyes still haunted (Y/N)\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u00a0 The conversation between Thanos and Gamora ranged from hateful words to promises of family, to even more hateful words, until (Y/N) heard this bullshit:</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cInteresting\u2026is that why she\u2019s stressing over the control system to free your sister?\u201d Thanos accused, turning his head to watch (Y/N)\u2019s head flip up to his, her eyes wide at being caught as she began to furiously bang at the tablet until it hit the ground with the crack of glass and fizzle of a dying car battery, herself blowing the wisps of hair out of her face in frustration.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know what, you should really consider making this thing more user-friendly,\u201d (Y/N) accused back as Gamora rolled her eyes. Even Nebula\u2019s was able to let out an annoyed sigh. \u201cI actually know a great tech guy. Stark Industries. Could get this shit sorted out in minutes,\u201d (Y/N) offered rapidly just as one of the guards fell from her ice prison with a dull smack like a drunken Death Eater on the metal flooring.\u00a0\u201cHe was like that when I got here-\u201d (Y/N) proclaimed, but her voice was choked out of her throat as Thanos wielded his gauntlet, bringing her closer to him in rows of red chains that tightened around her body the more she tried to struggle out of them.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cChildren,\u201d Thanos grumbled lowly as he looked down on Gamora. \u201cI\u00a0never taught you to lie\u2026that\u2019s why you\u2019re so bad at it,\u201d Thanos hissed at her, then turned his attention to (Y/N).\u00a0\u201cAnd I thought better of you. <i>Expected</i> more of you. An open mind and more common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI mean, thought that was a pretty good run\u2026considering,\u201d (Y/N) croaked out, her midsection being strangled by the anaconda-like pressure.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Thanos enunciated darkly, leaving Gamora to lower her head behind him as he approached (Y/N), his tongue ticking at her as he placed a finger under her chin.\u00a0\u201cI suppose now is the time to enforce some harsher discipline, seeing as you cannot seem to control yourself.\u201d (Y/N) yanked her face away from Thanos, her eyes glowing deathly white, far past her usual silver. She caught sight of Gamora mouthing something to her, but (Y/N) couldn\u2019t make it out as\u00a0Thanos\u2019s fist opened and closed, his fingertips beginning to burn with blue energy that (Y/N) recognized as the space stone.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMind control,\u201d (Y/N) scoffed.\u00a0\u201cAnd I thought I asked for some creativity.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhatever it takes to get the job done,\u201d Thanos grinned just as he aimed his fist for (Y/N)\u2019s face.\u00a0\u201cAnything more to add?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026burn in hell,\u201d (Y/N) snarled, making Thanos cock his head, a wicked grin splitting his face as the blue aura became a raging fire,\u00a0but Gamora grabbed his arm at the last moment to point at her instead.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, distracting him just as (Y/N) broke free from her bondage, charging Thanos, but he rounded on her, the palm of his other hand meeting the center of her forehead that made her eyes roll into the back of her head. All those years in yoga and this was the first time that she actually felt her third eye open up\u2026or maybe that was the splitting of her skull. Either way, a rapid-fire projection show of images from her past surfaced in her mind too quick for her to focus on one embarrassing moment at a time. Outside of her mind, time seemed to be frozen as her limp body floated among the blue magic that forced Gamora to fly and hit her back against a stone wall where she crumpled to the ground. She tried to fight the force, but it was too much. The Infinity Stone would\u2019ve killed her, just like everyone else in the Universe except for one\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 Moments passed under the Space Stone\u2019s spell until (Y/N) hit the ground in a runner\u2019s stance, now shrouded in a <a href=\"http://rowan-and-rhysand-trash.tumblr.com/post/145800346769/swords-are-boring-indeed-aelin-galathynius\">black cloak</a>\u00a0with silver detailing laced around the edges like frost in the night, battle armor adorning her figure as her hair fell like a veil of death over her face. Taking a few breaths, she finally rose, eyes snapping open to meet Thanos\u2019s, but all she could see were shadows in a sea of blue haze. She had no idea what was going on until she felt her own cold, broken lips begin to move, mind not in control of her own actions.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMaster, I am here to serve, \u201d her voice hollowly contended as she felt her left knee kiss the cold metal ground, her head lowering in a bow of respect.</p><p>\u00a0 She was trapped inside of her own body.</p><p>\u00a0 Desperately, her mind demanded her limbs to obey her, to fight back, to kill the bastard who was dead set to kill almost everyone she loved and cared for, but she was helpless to the spell. And with the gruesome realization of her unwilling obedience to the Mad Titan himself, the darkness overcame her.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYUJMbc4I2mRJul-C-Rv_7w\">@fanaticwritings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5HZ3U1t8DOK0pLeTjKskg\">@inumorph</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myqn4ifHH58bObOtyht1FSQ\">@dawn121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN9DldOxAXGIUkDC3VjZmxg\">@bubbleteaproduction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miiBX34jw1Mz_9yBxwbM8FA\">@deanskitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc3YhKa0nQ6C5c50zMTXYA\">@shamvictoria11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz6K1NOqNRuKlsKl705UBJw\">@maybeiamamermaid</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a></p><p><a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/148438393715/the-ultimate-masterlist\">MASTERLIST</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/174735659745/chapter-1-the-orb-avengers-x-femreader\">Chapter 1</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175071067210/chapter-2-currently-fearing-the-reaper-avengers\">Chapter 2</a> \u00a0| \u00a0<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175400908850/chapter-3-earth-is-closed-today-avengers-x\">Chapter 3</a></p><p>*please follow and let me know if you\u2019d like to be tagged.

I wanted to post this for you ASAP, so enjoy&hellip;if you dare xx</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>TONY&rsquo;S POV</p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&ldquo;(Y/N)! (Y/N)!&rdquo; Tony called out, his voice straining from the tightness of his throat, blood and tears mixing on his wounded skin, but he needed to find her. It was a gnawing urge that forced his buried panic to resurface like a weight on his chest. Once more, he let his person slip between his fingertips, and once again he realized that no one could hate him as much as he hated himself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; Strange cut in, but Tony was inconsolable, himself beginning to search further inside Ebony Maw&rsquo;s&nbsp;ship, the creatures dead body still lying where (Y/N) had stabbed him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Stark, there&rsquo;s no use. She&rsquo;s not-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t lose her! Not again. (Y/N)!&rdquo; Tony countered, trying to convince himself more than Strange, but he knew at this moment that he had lost it. Tony continued to pace, calling out her name until Peter stepped in front of him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mr. Stark, we&hellip;we haven&rsquo;t lost her, yet,&rdquo; Peter coaxed quietly, making Tony lock his jaw.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know (Y/N). If anything, I&rsquo;d be nervous for Thanos. I&rsquo;m not really happy about it, but doing what you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t really helping either&hellip;sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What? Screaming her name into the void isn&rsquo;t helping?&rdquo; Tony joked back, his heart not really in it, but understood Peter&rsquo;s point&nbsp;as he patted him on the shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the right track, kid&hellip;she was right about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Touching moment, you two,&rdquo; Strange interjected impatiently, seeing as to how Tony&rsquo;s panic attack had now passed&hellip;mostly. &ldquo;But finding her isn&rsquo;t the priority now. If it really is Thanos who has her, then I&rsquo;m sure wherever he is, she&rsquo;ll be. Titan is still our best option.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you lose your emotions during a wizarding accident, or something?&rdquo; Tony accused, but Strange ignored his jab, instead watching the oncoming planet that their ship was headed straight towards, the impact imminent.</p><p>&nbsp; Walking by Tony, Peter made one last comment.&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N) has never given up on anything. We shouldn&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Peter proposed as he made his way towards the helm of the ship. Tony, in that moment, had never been more proud of Peter. The kid still had so much potential. So much.</p><p>&nbsp; But reality hit him straight in the face when he witnessed the barren wasteland they were about to crash into. With any luck, wherever (Y/N) was, it was better than dealing with this shit.</p><hr /><p>READER&rsquo;S&nbsp;POV</p><p>&nbsp; Maybe, (Y/N) had finally lost her mind. Maybe, today should be the day that she gives in to her psychosis. To be free of reality, and live by the flow that life leads for her to follow, taking it one bare, naked footstep through the flower field at a time. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun? To just let go. Wouldn&rsquo;t that just be the dream? A lustful, 1970&prime;s&nbsp;Stevie Nicks, acid-tripping, peaceful-protesting, flower-powering fantasy? <i>Fantasy</i> being the key word.</p><p>&nbsp; The colors faded in and out of focus, melding together in powdered smoke that rose deep inside her mind&rsquo;s eye. The closer she reached to consciousness, the more violent the colors became. The more the dust became the fire shot from a gun, bullets piercing her brain with each flash of hair-raising vibrancy. A shock. A bang. An explosion. A chaotic warfare forcing a battering ram into the doors of her psyche that were locked tight around the barriers of her awareness, but the wood was splintering and the fires were igniting. They were burning red hot into a lick of yellow, transforming into the spindly fingers of a wicked green, contorting into a ball of raging blue that scorched her into consciousness with a sharp yelp that evaporated into the humid air.</p><p>&nbsp; Deep inhales were all her body could manage as a cold sweat trickled down her spine to overcompensate the burning sensation that continued to blister her skin. The abrupt awakening sparked her eyes with a newfound urgency and arrow-point accuracy as they searched the dark, damp cavern that she found herself in, the view beyond the metal beams that trapped her as ancient as time itself. The best way to describe her predicament would be to say that she was a bird trapped in a cage, feeling the weight of herself and the chair she was strapped to not firm on solid ground, but rather levitating by the fiery blue energy that had shocked her from her dream, it&rsquo;s poisonous tendrils wrapping themselves around her bare toes that prickled with sleep. The faint drips of something liquid and the far-off echoes of bangs of the inner-working of a metallic ship caught her attention as she felt another person&rsquo;s presence suck the air from her lungs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Not knowing the entity would yet to cease her tounge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I hope you have more than some handcuffs and a few metal bars to intimidate me, becuase if you think this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been in this situation, then you don&rsquo;t realize how kinky I can really get,&rdquo; (Y/N) panted out more confidently than her body could manage, just barely lifting up her head enough to see through the wild hair that mangled her vision, hoping to size up her captor.&nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly, hit me with your best shot. I&rsquo;m looking for the full production. Entertainment at it&rsquo;s fucking finest.&nbsp;Really inspire me here. I&rsquo;m asking for torture creativity&hellip;&rdquo; she ranted until she finally caught sight of her captor through the shadows, his figure looming ominously just beyond the edge of the water-filled chasm she was perched above, and wow. She was not ready.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your petulance astounds me, child. You&rsquo;re much more brazen than even I had anticipated through my years of watching you grow,&rdquo; her captor announced, his massive body somehow more intense than even Hulk to match. But what really caught her attention (besides the thing that was growing on his chin that she soon realized was just his chin) was his voice. The voice from her dream.</p><p>&nbsp; <i>Thanos</i>. And as much as she hated to admit it, the name and recognition of his identity alone dropped her heart into the pit of her stomach with a dull thud. It wasn&rsquo;t just his size, but the way he stood and commanded the room. There was no trace of doubt. He knew what he wanted and there wasn&rsquo;t a damn thing he wouldn&rsquo;t do to get it. Years of patience had brought him this far, and he had finally decided that he had mastered his craft. It was less from his words that she perceived this, but from his eyes that were more than dark, but focused. Focused on one path, and one alone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; It was one he shared with her own father.</p><p>&nbsp; But she recovered quickly, dragging her eyes like claws in the dirt to focus on his, despite the guttural instinct inside of her that screamed at her ragdoll limbs to tuck themselves into a ball and hide. But that instinct was buried with the rest of her fear, locked tight inside a box next to the other box that, apparently, held her will to live.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a lot more purple than I thought you would be,&rdquo; (Y/N) responded apathetically. &ldquo;Guess, we both got an unwelcomed surprise today.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I disagree,&rdquo; Thanos countered patiently.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are enthusiasically welcomed on my ship. More welcome than possibly anyone here, in fact. My hope lies in your willingness to give great thought and action to what I am told the late Ebony has evoked upon you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;How &lsquo;bout, instead, I give you a fresh basket of <i>go fuck yourself</i>, and we both go off on our happy, merry ways. Deal?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Suddenly, she was jerked forward, gripping the edges of her chair with her chipped nails as the cage hovered towards Thanos, his fist balled in a golden, Hamburger Helper glove that willed her to him. Regaining her composure, she held Thanos&rsquo; glare, matching his intensity as she neared his unusually scarred and cratered face that reminded her of a Grand Canyon on an alien planet that nobody would ever want to visit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re the one in the cage,&rdquo; Thanos threatened as the tendrils wrapped around her ankles, but she kicked them off with a scoff.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All the more reason to prove that you&rsquo;re terrified of me,&rdquo; she purred through a smirk as she watched Thanos&rsquo; frown deepen.&nbsp;&ldquo;What? Don&rsquo;t think you can control me otherwise? Becuase on this one thing, you&rsquo;d be right&hellip;but just so we&rsquo;re clear, everything else you&rsquo;re preaching is a complete bust and, ultimately going to fail. It didn&rsquo;t work for Hitler, so what makes you so special?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Petty how you only see the Universe through the lens of your own planet and it&rsquo;s many&nbsp;downfalls when there are so many beings, too many beings, for you to even comprehend.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, good morning, Mr. High and Mighty. Maybe, I should introduce you to Humility sometime. Guess since you&rsquo;re deep-fisting a few Infinity Stones, you now think you have all the answers then, don&rsquo;t you? This just in, buddy,&rdquo; (Y/N) dared, the fear creeping into her throat, but she shoved it back down, focusing on her words rather than her emotions as she tugged at the Power Stone that, surprisingly, still hung around her neck.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one too. Which begs the question: why? You&rsquo;ve got me locked in this cage <i>with</i> the stone, instead of dead and without it. You say you&rsquo;ve got this master plan, but so far, I&rsquo;m not putting the pieces together here, so maybe&hellip;&rdquo; (Y/N) paused her rant for a moment, closing her eyes to take a breath to calm herself down, a plan of her own hatching in her brain that wasn&rsquo;t her typical style, but a means to an end&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Her eyes flickered up to Thanos&rsquo;s once more, her head cocked to the side in question which peeked his interest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Thanos prodded.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But maybe because I haven&rsquo;t gotten the full story, yet,&rdquo; she wondered aloud.&nbsp;&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve heard about you sounds straight out of a legend from the mouths of people you&rsquo;d either just threatened, or hired. Maybe I haven&rsquo;t heard your side of the story yet and since you&rsquo;ve so stupidly allowed me to live this long, I take it you probably want to share it with me. Am I wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Very intuitive,&rdquo; Thanos grinned as he took a seat on his throne, waving the chains away from (Y/N)&rsquo;s wrists and ankles, allowing her the opportunity to lounge in her own chair&nbsp;that felt like a broken lawn chair in comparison to his, but she never wavered in her confidence.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I must ask: what changed your mind so quickly?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious,&rdquo; she shrugged.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; Thanos drawled as he began to relax, taking note of his prisoner&rsquo;s false face that she wore, so familiar to the one his daughter had worn in the years before her betrayal. The one that had led to her being knocked out at the foot of his throne while he took the opportuity to interrogate his new and improved right-hand in peace.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Before we start your therapy session, maybe we talk about the poor soul you have sniffing your toes first?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked, her empathy well-masked, yet unmistakable to Thanos which made his mouth twitch into a tight-lipped grin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to her,&rdquo; he mused, making (Y/N) lift an eyebrow and hold her hands up defensively, motioning for him to begin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Growing up, my home planet of Titan was constantly on the brink of collapse from famine, disease, and war. Every day was a struggle. It was in that time watching my people starve that I came up with the idea to balance the population. To kill half of the people in order for my planet to flourish in their wake. Random, of course. The rich, the poor, and whoever in between. Chaos into balance. All for the rest of my planet to become happy and healthy for centuries to come. To finally be able to live.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you know what they say about chaos?&rdquo; (Y/N) sighed, quoting Heath Ledger&rsquo;s, the Joker.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I had a feeling that you were right for the job,&rdquo; Thanos smiled in approval, making (Y/N) smile to herself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Interesting&hellip;&rdquo; (Y/N) mused, wondering if she should point out Thanos&rsquo;s connection to, in her opinion, one of the greatest villains of all-time, but thought better of it in order to keep up with her plan to keep the peace.</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos watched her face carefully, but she remained neutral, only nodding after her comment as she waited for him to continue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;So desperately did they crave salvation, a solution to their inevitable demise, yet when I offered them one&hellip;&rdquo; Thanos recalled darkly, shaking his head in disapproval,&nbsp;&ldquo;they called me a Madman. And once my planet turned to ruins, I knew that I had been right. And now, here we are. So many planets so close to extinction, so many people suffering when the solution is right here with me. I refuse to allow another waste of a civilization.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But if your problem is a starving population, why not use the stones to provide a meal a day to those who need it? Snap, and there&rsquo;s a Thanksgiving dinner for half the world sitting on their table.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that simple.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But genocide is?&rdquo; (Y/N) countered, but quickly realized his mind had been set for decades. His expression was immovable, so (Y/N) changed her tone.&nbsp;&ldquo;How are you so sure that this would work?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked calmly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t my first time.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; That shocked (Y/N), and there was no way that she could hide it. She suddenly got a glimpse of the slaughtering of millions, blood, gore, and death. Bodies stacked upon bodies. Something out of Chainsaw Massacre. Something like she had experienced in Hydra. How has he not been stopped, yet? Or, at least, had she never heard of him before? This seems like a major issue that should have been addressed ages ago.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Surprised? So was she,&rdquo; Thanos grinned, gazing down at the woman on the ground beneath him, her jade-hued fingers beginning to twitch. He cocked his head to the side.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe she should be the one to tell you about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Closing his fist, a flash of blue light erupted from his glove as the woman&rsquo;s eyes shot open in a panic, herself standing up to address her attacker as she drew her sword. Her hyperventilation filled the room until her eyes landed on Thanos, her hatred pure and unforgiving as she started towards him only to have her weapon dissipate in a flurry of bubbles just as it reached Thanos&rsquo;s neck. The woman flew backwards to land on the ground in front of (Y/N)&rsquo;s cage, hitting her head against the bars that had finally landed on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Had to admit, (Y/N) was impressed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You brought me back here?&rdquo; She snarled at Thanos as she stood.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where else would I take you, Daughter?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Daughter?&rdquo; (Y/N) choked out. Both Thanos and his, apparently, daughter turned on her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, you just don&rsquo;t really seem like the, uh&hellip;fatherly type.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hardly. And he&rsquo;s not my father,&rdquo; the woman growled back at Thanos.&nbsp;&ldquo;So,&nbsp;now you have a prisoner?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a prisoner,&rdquo; Thanos explained casually.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I kind of feel like a prisoner,&rdquo; (Y/N) shrugged as she tapped the bars with her fingernails.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Only until I have your full cooperation, Little One,&rdquo; Thanos mused, his lips pulling into a sneer as his daughter tensed. She hung her head low, avoiding his eye contact, but the guilt and self-loathing was clear in her face. (Y/N) wasn&rsquo;t sure why, but this seemed like a very personal blow from Thanos.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So this is why you took her? To replace me?&rdquo; The woman accused, narrowing her eyes at Thanos who still had his lips curled.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; he responded coldly, echoing his daughter&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;&ldquo;She is much more powerful than even you were, and the only one that will be able to retrieve the Infinity Stone that I need. Something you were unable to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; This grabbed his daughter&rsquo;s attention, her eyes finally meeting his as he towered directly over her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I disappointed you,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&nbsp; Thanos let out another disapproving sigh as he leaned closer to her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am disappointed,&rdquo; he stated, taking a strand of her wavy red hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;And not becuase you didn&rsquo;t find it, but because you did. And you lied.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; The tension hung in the air as they both sized each other up, Thanos not wanting to hurt his daughter, and her probably wanting to hurt him, but knowing that she couldn&rsquo;t. (Y/N) finally decided to step in.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh, not that I&rsquo;m not fully entertained by your family drama and wouldn&rsquo;t invest in a Keeping Up With the Infinity Stones, but&hellip;this seems like a very personal matter. Should I&hellip;maybe step out, or&hellip;? Becuase it seems like you two have some things to work out here-&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the woman insisted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know exactly where I stand.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Gamora,&rdquo; Thanos sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;How you continue to disappoint me. But my question is, would you dare to disappoint your sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sister, too?&rdquo; (Y/N) exclaimed, Thanos and Gamora glared at her again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like I said, should I step outside?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Thanos denied, focusing his attention on (Y/N) now which she suddenly regretted as Thanos began to encircle her like a shark sniffing out his next meal.&nbsp;&ldquo;But what I do want is for you to give me your final thoughts on the plan.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) let out a laugh, leaning back in her chair again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe I would if you told me exactly what you wanted me to do in this whole <i>plan </i>of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Gamora&rsquo;s face cringed in disgust at (Y/N)&rsquo;s words, confused as to why this random girl would even consider his cruelty. Who the hell was she?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It would be my pleasure,&rdquo; Thanos smiled as he turned his back on her to return to his throne, beginning his explanation as he walked. In those seconds, (Y/N) gained Gamora&rsquo;s attention and mouthed, <i>we have to work together</i>, widening her eyes hoping that Gamora understood. At first, Gamora seemed to distrust (Y/N), but quickly realized that the girl was in a cage, so Thanos obviously didn&rsquo;t trust her. Which made her the perfect ally.&nbsp;&ldquo;As I mentioned before, I have watched you grow from afar. Ever since you came in contact with the Orb, my interest in you has grown. You&rsquo;ve been through so much, child, seen so much. You have witnessed the worst of humanity, the places in which resources are limited and want is plentiful, yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; (Y/N) responded, letting the emotions of what she had experienced during her days on the streets consume her. Look, if she wanted Thanos to trust her, she really had to sell it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is one reason why I have chosen you. I think that you, of all people, will understand my vision. The assistance that may be offered to those in need.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And the other reason you chose me?&rdquo; (Y/N) prodded, ignoring his failed logic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your connection with the Vision.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, you already said that,&rdquo; (Y/N) contended after a moment, making Thanos frown. And that was not a pretty sight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, child. <i>The</i> Vision. The keeper of the Mind Stone,&rdquo; Thanos explained further as (Y/N) did an awkward, <i>ohhhhh, right, </i>taking full responsibility of her own failed logic.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, you know him well.&rdquo; (Y/N) cocked her head to the side.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well enough, then,&rdquo; Thanos corrected.&nbsp;&ldquo;What I need from you is to take the stone from him.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) froze. No more jokes. This got much more serious in an instant. Yes, aiding Thanos in any way would be disgusting and wrong, but to actually be the one to, not only <i>take</i> the stone, but to be the one to take Vision&rsquo;s life? To kill the only person, besides maybe herself, that has come anywhere close to the relationship that Wanda had with her brother? Yeah, no. She had to get the fuck out of there, pronto.</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) scoffed, still maintaining her neutrality.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, you think that becuase I&rsquo;m friends with Vision, that that would make it easier to assassinate him?&rdquo; (Y/N) questioned.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, that makes perfect sense.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A small price to pay,&rdquo; Thanos proclaimed as (Y/N) made a face.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your relationship will allow you to get close to him and take the stone before he can defend himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So betray his trust?&rdquo; (Y/N) broke in.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Now you understand,&rdquo; Thanos smiled (didn&rsquo;t think anything could be worse than the frowing, but she was wrong). (Y/N) shook her head, completely miffed by this dude&rsquo;s departure from sanity and lack of humanity. She was right. There wasn&rsquo;t anything that he wouldn&rsquo;t do, and no biting comment she would make was going to change that. Acceptance, whether it was real or not, would be her only way out.&nbsp;&ldquo;All you need to do is give me the Mind Stone, then this can all be over as soon as it started. Then, the Universe can truly begin to renew itself.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This <i>has</i> gone by insanely quick,&rdquo; (Y/N) whispered in awe (that wasn&rsquo;t entirely disingenuous), thinking that just a few hours ago she was back on Earth watching pigeons cage match over some road-kill hot dog from the window of a wizard&rsquo;s lair. She looked up to Thanos.&nbsp;&ldquo;You really do believe in this?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How could you even think of doing this?&rdquo; Gamora yelled at her, charging her cell.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know that I don&rsquo;t know you, but this can&rsquo;t be something that you want! The pain and suffering that my planet felt after he came and destroyed it remains. Yes, there may be more resources to go around, but we will never forgive what we lost or forget who we lost. Never.&rdquo; By the end, Gamora had tears streaming down her cheeks, anger boiling over. Her pain was tangible, squeezing (Y/N)&rsquo;s own stomach at the thought of her own friends and family&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But this is just one generation,&rdquo; (Y/N) argued back, leaving Gamora speechless and bringing Thanos to lean closer in anticipation to her next words, his elbows resting on his knees.&nbsp;&ldquo;Once this generation has passed, and those who had to deal with the agony have come and gone, all you have left is the good that has come out of your father&rsquo;s plan. I&rsquo;m sure, whether you know it or not, some people now have already found gratefulness in what he&rsquo;s done&hellip;and I think that I would be among them,&rdquo; (Y/N) concluded thoughtfully, throwing a knowing look to Thanos who studied her closely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying. You can&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to lose everything,&rdquo; Gamora swore, and that&rsquo;s where (Y/N) let out a dark laugh.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Losing loved ones is old news for me,&rdquo; (Y/N) dismissed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Once you get through the hurricane, there&rsquo;s always a way come back from the destruction. I watched my entire family die right in front of me, and I&rsquo;m still here. In fact, I&rsquo;ve made a new one of my own, and I can do it again.&nbsp;If I can make it so others can live a life better than mine, I&rsquo;m all in.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; And in that moment, her cage dissolved in an array of shiny bubbles that reflected the shock in both (Y/N)&rsquo;s and Gamora&rsquo;s expressions. Thanos barely lifted a finger, his arms still resting on his throne that were carved in what resembled crocodile skin. Fitting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Finally&hellip;a worthy ally. Welcome to the Black Order, (Y/N), my newfound pride and glory,&rdquo; Thanos announced as (Y/N) did an awkward curtsy thing that she didn&rsquo;t even understand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor, really, but uh,&nbsp;I hope I can first ask&hellip;&rdquo; (Y/N) began, putting a slight shake into her voice which seemed to please Thanos greatly as he smiled down to her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course you may,&rdquo; Thanos allowed as (Y/N) nodded with a shy smile.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where exactly are we?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked, suppressing a laugh when she heard Gamora grumble about her&nbsp;&lsquo;own personal hellscape.&rsquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe near somewhere that I know like Sakaar, or Xandar, or&hellip;?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Xandar has already been destroyed,&rdquo; Thanos interrupted, a bragging tone entering his voice as (Y/N)&rsquo;s own faltered with a small,<i> oh</i>.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about them. Their planet was doomed from the very beginning. Have you been?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I uh&hellip;I&rsquo;ve just heard stories.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;If you had been, I promise that you would have seen it&rsquo;s uselessness. However,&nbsp;I found fragments of the Orb there,&rdquo; Thanos explained, revealing one of the sockets on his glove to be halfway filled with a piece of amethyst light,&nbsp;&ldquo;but once I discovered the rest of the stone&rsquo;s&nbsp;transfer to Asgard, I knew, not only of Xandar&rsquo;s time to be decimated, but that&nbsp;Loki would be the perfect option to reunite you with the stone. Why you ever decided to part ways with it to begin with, I shall never fully understand. You were one of the fiercest warriors I had ever seen. I suppose now I shall make you so once more.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Loki? How did you&hellip;?&rdquo; (Y/N) questioned (ignoring his comment about &lsquo;once&rsquo; being the fiercest, since she was still the fiercest, so fuck him) as she slowly put the pieces together.&nbsp;&ldquo;New York. You were already in his head.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite persistent when he wants to be,&rdquo; Thanos complimented.&nbsp;&ldquo;But his lack of conviction is repulsive. His use had quickly worn thin.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Had?&rdquo; (Y/N) choked out, her voice so small from the tightness that grew inside her throat.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that you cared for him? After his attempt to take control of your planet?&rdquo; Thanos chided her which just&hellip;she had to swallow down,&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>then what the hell are you doing?</i>&rsquo; And&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>but you were the one who sent him to Earth</i>,&rsquo; to instead take a moment to gather more intel about her surroundings. She found a few ways to escape, but only one really stood out to her.&nbsp;&ldquo;But returning to your primary question, we are just outside of Knowhere. Pitiful place, alas it is where I found, not only the Reality Stone, but my daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s ever so grateful,&rdquo; Gamora murmured coldly with her arms crossed over her chest. She was more like (Y/N) than she could even know. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Daughter, you continue to forget your once shared loyalty to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That was before I knew I had a choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And you chose wrong,&rdquo; Thanos growled as he leaned towards Gamora again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Where is the Soul Stone?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Gamora demanded, gritting her teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, come on,&rdquo; (Y/N) scoffed, rolling her eyes which surprised both Gamora and Thanos.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, he&rsquo;s going to get it out of you, so just bite the bullet on this one.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Gamora shot back, making (Y/N) sigh.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not as good an actress as you think, and he&rsquo;s got two and a half Infinity Stones while you have none. It&rsquo;s common sense, really.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You heard her,&rdquo; Thanos rumbled, throwing an appreciatory glance at (Y/N).&nbsp;&ldquo;Out with it, Gamora. If not, you know that I have other methods of making you talk. And I wouldn&rsquo;t want to have to crush you when all you have to do is give me a name.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a small burst of giggling that floated in the air. Thanos wrinkled up his face as he found the source in (Y/N).&nbsp;&ldquo;What is so funny?&rdquo; he demanded at her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; (Y/N) sighed, waving him off.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s just funny because&hellip;I was thinking the same thing,&rdquo; she finished with a smirk as she twisted her hand at her side and the last crack in the stalactite above Thanos&rsquo;s head hurtled it&rsquo;s way towards himself and Gamora. (Y/N) used her right hand to pull Gamora away from the damage, the woman sliding on the ground towards (Y/N) as she used her left hand to force Thanos to crash into his throne, having used the falling boulder as a distraction crushing his body with many crunches that were hopefully his bones, but she doubted it. (Y/N) reached down for Gamora&rsquo;s hand to pull her up as they both began to run towards the nearest exit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was going to wait a bit longer, but he really opened himself up for that one,&rdquo; (Y/N) laughed, nudging Gamora excitedly, but the woman was clearly in shock with some serious tunnel vision.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know your way around here right?&rdquo; (Y/N) called to Gamora who was overcoming her momentary whiplash, but quickly shook herself off, gearing herself into a war mentality.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Unfortunately. This way, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Gamora yelled back, but they both skidded to a stop when Thanos appeared in front of them just before they reached the exit, his image seeming to be unfolded from reality in a tear of red, himself shaking his head in disappointment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You really believed that would stop me?&rdquo; Thanos reprimanded as (Y/N) handed Gamora an ice katana.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Gotta admit, I kinda hoped so,&rdquo; (Y/N) taunted back, cracking her neck before she howled into her fight with Thanos, ice katanas wielded as she drove them towards his face, but she was swatted aside just as Gamora reached his calf with the hilt of her own sword. Bouncing off his skin which caused him to become unbalanced, allowing (Y/N) the opportunity to throw another boulder at him where he cascaded into the water with a tsunami of a wave.</p><p>&nbsp; Finding their opening, (Y/N) and Gamora bolted out of the throne room and into a stone-carved hallway, columns rising against the left side of the hallway that opened up to the throne room they had just left, Thanos&rsquo;s piercing roars echoing off the cavern walls around them like a subway tearing through a tunnel. After each pillar, (Y/N) could see Thanos&rsquo;s figure rising from the water until he spotted her as well. Thinking quickly, (Y/N) used the pillars to her advantage to hurl at him with her magic as she continued to run, the pillars alight in burning purple magic as they attacked Thanos, knocking him back with each blow until the women veered off to the right and away from the throne room entirely, (Y/N) following Gamora as she knocked aside Black Order members. (Y/N) joined her in the fight as more crowded the hallways.</p><p>&nbsp; It was soon that both women realized that they were right in deciding to become allies because they worked wonders together. Protecting each other&rsquo;s backs and finishing off a guard that the first one had started. It was very much for (Y/N) like fighting side-by-side with Nat, which she had to stop thinking about because it just reminded her that she wasn&rsquo;t home yet. But she would get there&hellip;even if it killed her.</p><p>&nbsp; But everything came to a halt when Gamora pointed towards another hallway for them to escape through, (Y/N) rounding the corner first to almost have her head torn off by a boulder that Thanos threw that gouged a hole in the stone above her head as (Y/N) threw her arm across Gamora&rsquo;s chest to stop her from running, them both taking cover behind the wall.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this the only way to go?&rdquo; (Y/N) shouted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;From here, yes!&rdquo; Gamora responded in frustration, running through different tunnel variations in her head with no luck, but her words gave (Y/N) an idea. Taking Gamora&rsquo;s arm, (Y/N) focused her energy on the Orb which glowed before they both fell through a black hole, appearing in a quiet section of the ship that looked like someone&rsquo;s empty apartment, but made of stone. The ceiling lights were burning red color that reminded (Y/N) of the Red Light District in Amsterdam. Not her first choice in a place to stay, but it would do.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You just thought to use that now?&rdquo; Gamora accused (Y/N) immediately which made her fold her arms defensively.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And you just recently decided to turn against <i>that</i> clusterfuck?&rdquo; (Y/N) bit back which made Gamora shake her head, silently agreeing with her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Besides, if you really do know where this Vormir place is, then why the fuck would you get close enough to him to get captured? Didn&rsquo;t think to screw off to some no-name galaxy and wipe away any traces of your existence? Probably would&rsquo;ve helped the rest of us!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hypocritical much?&rdquo; Gamora growled back.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bringing the Power Stone to Thanos because your pride outweighs your brain.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) considered Gamora for a moment, then nodded her head and extended her hand to her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; (Y/N) acquiesced as Gamora accepted her hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t get anywhere if we fight each other, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Agreed. Do you know where we are now?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; Gamora hummed as she walked to the window, peering past the curtains into the ship.&nbsp;&ldquo;West Wing. We need to get to Section 47 that houses all the ships. The only problem is that it&rsquo;s probably already flooded with guards, so&hellip;is there any way you could transport us off of the ship?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I just found out that I could do this shit today. Not exactly an expert, yet,&rdquo; (Y/N) huffed, trying to calm down the panic that was rising inside of her.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if you described it to me, this Section 47. Maybe, I could transport us there if I had an image in my head&hellip;and hopefully not transport us straight into space where we suffocate and die,&rdquo; (Y/N) rambled nervously as she peered out the window as well to see a large cavern that was completely void of life, only blue flickering lights cast an eerie image on the cold, stone walls.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean unless you can think of some other way to get us out of here that wouldn&rsquo;t involve the risk of moonwalking to our graves?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not leaving without my sister,&rdquo; Gamora stated.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Or risk&hellip;wait, what?&rdquo; (Y/N) asked numbly, not really believing what she had just heard.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you just say&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He mentioned my sister. I won&rsquo;t leave without her,&rdquo; Gamora insisted again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; (Y/N) whisper-screamed, slamming the curtains shut as she began to pace in front of Gamora.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding me!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;About wanting to help my sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, about being an idiot!&rdquo; (Y/N) argued back, then calmed herself down again, running her hands through her hair.&nbsp;&ldquo;How the hell do you even know he has her? All he said was that you shouldn&rsquo;t disappoint her, or whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, maybe that &lsquo;whatever&rsquo; is the part where you missed that he obviously has her. That was his threat to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Exactly! Let&rsquo;s not let that threat work!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have a sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Even if I did, we&rsquo;re not playing this dumbass empathy game. I&rsquo;m not going back, and you&rsquo;re not either, so let me ask a better question? Do you want to be the reason that half the Universe will die? No? Didn&rsquo;t think so. Now, what are we thinking? Steal a ship and Hans Solo it out of here?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your references mean nothing to me!&rdquo; Gamora whispered harshly back at (Y/N).&nbsp;&ldquo;And I know what I&rsquo;m risking. My sister has made&hellip;mistakes in her past, but she is still my sister. Just thinking about what Thanos will do to her if I leave her here&hellip;she was always a pawn to him, just like me and everyone else. But I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll let her live this time.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; (Y/N) watched Gamora intently, Gamora&rsquo;s own eyes never leaving (Y/N)&rsquo;s face. This was something that she wanted, and if she was anything like Thanos, she was going to get it. Unintentionally, (Y/N)&rsquo;s mind reeled back to her brother clutching at her hand before he was shot in their childhood home, his promises of safety echoing in her mind before she shook herself out of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no, No, nO, NO, and did I mention no?&rdquo; (Y/N) spluttered out.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know how hard this must be, but you have to think logically. You have information that Thanos can&rsquo;t have. I&rsquo;m just being honest here, but there&rsquo;s a 50/50 chance that your sister wouldn&rsquo;t even make it out alive after &lsquo;the snap&rsquo;&nbsp;anyway, but at least in this scenario, you and I don&rsquo;t have to get captured. Here&rsquo;s a weapon. Now, let&rsquo;s get the fuck out of here,&rdquo; (Y/N) commanded, taking Steve&rsquo;s tone that seemed to break Gamora for a second as she took the katana from (Y/N), but the moment didn&rsquo;t last.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me rephrase, then&hellip;I can&rsquo;t leave her,&rdquo; Gamora whispered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised at the things you can do.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like leave you here on this ship without a way off of it?&rdquo; Gamora threatened which made (Y/N) put her hand dramatically to her chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, I know the way out of here and how to fly a ship. Can you do either of those things?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;won&rsquo;t know until I try it. And I&rsquo;m always up for new opportunities to put on my job resume when this superheroing comes to an end,&rdquo; (Y/N) responded sarcastically,&nbsp;narrowing her eyes at Gamora who was still watching her intently, crossed arms glued to her chest.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this! I&nbsp;have to get home!&rdquo; (Y/N) exclaimed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have people wating for me, people I need to protect. I&rsquo;m sorry about your sister, if she&rsquo;s even here, but I have people of my own! I&rsquo;m not screwing over my chance to be with them again just because you have a&nbsp;&lsquo;hunch&rsquo; that Thanos has her. I&rsquo;m sorry, but this is ridiculous. We are halfway to escaping and you&rsquo;re willing to give that up? No. Nope. No way. There&rsquo;s not a chance in hell that you&rsquo;re gonna convince me to go back for a suicide mission.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp; A few minutes later&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;How <i>the fuck</i> did you convince me to come back here?&rdquo; (Y/N) whispered, still in shock at the stupid decision she had made as she forced a frozen guard between the wall behind where Nebula was strung up by some kind of gravitational pull.&nbsp;(Y/N) and Gamora had been on their way to a smaller ship dock that Gamora figured would be easier to infiltrate, but as they were getting closer, they had heard the piercing screams of a woman that raked down (Y/N)&rsquo;s spine like nails.</p><p>&nbsp; <i>&ldquo;Well&hellip;that could be anyone,&rdquo;</i> (Y/N) had posited before Gamora forced them both to take a detour into Thanos&rsquo;s supposed torture chamber. Now, Gamora was attempting to figure out the mechanics of releasing Nebula while (Y/N) took care of the guard&rsquo;s <i>possibly</i> dead bodies. She didn&rsquo;t know and definitely didn&rsquo;t care enough to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Just as Gamora began to crack the code, the walls to the chamber began to open which scared the absolute hell out of (Y/N), her body frozen to the spot. In a rush, Gamora hissed at (Y/N) to hide as she stood to face her father, her body poised defensively in front of the blue-toned woman hovering mid-air, the mechanical pieces of her body floating away from each other to leave her body disjointed, her torso unconnected from her head, arm not attached to her shoulder, and so on. It was&hellip;ungodly&hellip;like nothing (Y/N) had ever seen before, even in her years locked inside of Hydra, the torture capital of Earth.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If this is my last stand, let it be so. Kill me if you have to,&rdquo; Gamora insisted through gritted teeth to (Y/N), knowing that there was nothing (Y/N) could do to argue as Thanos&rsquo;s shadow appeared beyond the realm of the chamber.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And so she returns,&rdquo; Thanos boasted, knowing his threat had worked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not for you,&rdquo; Gamora deadpanned.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; Thanos responded, taking a seat on the stoop in front of the chamber, facing away from Nebula as he patted the section next to him for Gamora to sit. She stood a few feet in front of him instead, back turned to him as she watched the murky black water ebb and flow as it always had for twenty years. Twenty goddamned, miserable years. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me (Y/N) left so soon?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She left me to fend for myself. She thought only one of us should risk capture,&rdquo; Gamora grumbled bitterly as (Y/N) squeezed her way through the opening in the wall to the tablet that Gamora had been punching in codes, glancing up to see the robot-girl from a closer angle, the view even more ghastly up close. The woman&rsquo;s eyes were frozen open in a state of shock, unblinking. Hopefully, she couldn&rsquo;t feel any of the horrible things that were happening to her, but (Y/N) knew better. Even when her attention turned to the control panel, Nebula&rsquo;s petrified eyes still haunted (Y/N)&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>&nbsp; The conversation between Thanos and Gamora ranged from hateful words to promises of family, to even more hateful words, until (Y/N) heard this bullshit:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Interesting&hellip;is that why she&rsquo;s stressing over the control system to free your sister?&rdquo; Thanos accused, turning his head to watch (Y/N)&rsquo;s head flip up to his, her eyes wide at being caught as she began to furiously bang at the tablet until it hit the ground with the crack of glass and fizzle of a dying car battery, herself blowing the wisps of hair out of her face in frustration.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know what, you should really consider making this thing more user-friendly,&rdquo; (Y/N) accused back as Gamora rolled her eyes. Even Nebula&rsquo;s was able to let out an annoyed sigh. &ldquo;I actually know a great tech guy. Stark Industries. Could get this shit sorted out in minutes,&rdquo; (Y/N) offered rapidly just as one of the guards fell from her ice prison with a dull smack like a drunken Death Eater on the metal flooring.&nbsp;&ldquo;He was like that when I got here-&rdquo; (Y/N) proclaimed, but her voice was choked out of her throat as Thanos wielded his gauntlet, bringing her closer to him in rows of red chains that tightened around her body the more she tried to struggle out of them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Children,&rdquo; Thanos grumbled lowly as he looked down on Gamora. &ldquo;I&nbsp;never taught you to lie&hellip;that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re so bad at it,&rdquo; Thanos hissed at her, then turned his attention to (Y/N).&nbsp;&ldquo;And I thought better of you. <i>Expected</i> more of you. An open mind and more common sense.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, thought that was a pretty good run&hellip;considering,&rdquo; (Y/N) croaked out, her midsection being strangled by the anaconda-like pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not good enough,&rdquo; Thanos enunciated darkly, leaving Gamora to lower her head behind him as he approached (Y/N), his tongue ticking at her as he placed a finger under her chin.&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose now is the time to enforce some harsher discipline, seeing as you cannot seem to control yourself.&rdquo; (Y/N) yanked her face away from Thanos, her eyes glowing deathly white, far past her usual silver. She caught sight of Gamora mouthing something to her, but (Y/N) couldn&rsquo;t make it out as&nbsp;Thanos&rsquo;s fist opened and closed, his fingertips beginning to burn with blue energy that (Y/N) recognized as the space stone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mind control,&rdquo; (Y/N) scoffed.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I thought I asked for some creativity.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever it takes to get the job done,&rdquo; Thanos grinned just as he aimed his fist for (Y/N)&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;&ldquo;Anything more to add?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;burn in hell,&rdquo; (Y/N) snarled, making Thanos cock his head, a wicked grin splitting his face as the blue aura became a raging fire,&nbsp;but Gamora grabbed his arm at the last moment to point at her instead.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she shouted, distracting him just as (Y/N) broke free from her bondage, charging Thanos, but he rounded on her, the palm of his other hand meeting the center of her forehead that made her eyes roll into the back of her head. All those years in yoga and this was the first time that she actually felt her third eye open up&hellip;or maybe that was the splitting of her skull. Either way, a rapid-fire projection show of images from her past surfaced in her mind too quick for her to focus on one embarrassing moment at a time. Outside of her mind, time seemed to be frozen as her limp body floated among the blue magic that forced Gamora to fly and hit her back against a stone wall where she crumpled to the ground. She tried to fight the force, but it was too much. The Infinity Stone would&rsquo;ve killed her, just like everyone else in the Universe except for one&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp; Moments passed under the Space Stone&rsquo;s spell until (Y/N) hit the ground in a runner&rsquo;s stance, now shrouded in a <a href=\"http://rowan-and-rhysand-trash.tumblr.com/post/145800346769/swords-are-boring-indeed-aelin-galathynius\">black cloak</a>&nbsp;with silver detailing laced around the edges like frost in the night, battle armor adorning her figure as her hair fell like a veil of death over her face. Taking a few breaths, she finally rose, eyes snapping open to meet Thanos&rsquo;s, but all she could see were shadows in a sea of blue haze. She had no idea what was going on until she felt her own cold, broken lips begin to move, mind not in control of her own actions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Master, I am here to serve, &rdquo; her voice hollowly contended as she felt her left knee kiss the cold metal ground, her head lowering in a bow of respect.</p><p>&nbsp; She was trapped inside of her own body.</p><p>&nbsp; Desperately, her mind demanded her limbs to obey her, to fight back, to kill the bastard who was dead set to kill almost everyone she loved and cared for, but she was helpless to the spell. And with the gruesome realization of her unwilling obedience to the Mad Titan himself, the darkness overcame her.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Taglist:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlSoQ-tzWXqmHBQjEOwnDYg\">@benedrylcumbersnatch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR0IW7pRRTlGjpaBZzLfoVw\">@daniellajocelyn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muXrTh8-Cv3mjVDxjEs3Ktg\">@ever-so-slightly-below-average</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKJ5sTXat_3jOUb9CtnlJjw\">@mysteriouslysharkbait</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mt6uzR8mKp99MC6sWbfZb_w\">@sireennotsiren</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\">@introvertedsin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDkKVCSpAX6qq9iDj5NKJLw\">@pluvialday</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYUJMbc4I2mRJul-C-Rv_7w\">@fanaticwritings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me4cXs-LqZjfS_X4AiYJsiQ\">@thenogravity</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD5HZ3U1t8DOK0pLeTjKskg\">@inumorph</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myqn4ifHH58bObOtyht1FSQ\">@dawn121</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN9DldOxAXGIUkDC3VjZmxg\">@bubbleteaproduction</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miiBX34jw1Mz_9yBxwbM8FA\">@deanskitten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGc3YhKa0nQ6C5c50zMTXYA\">@shamvictoria11</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz6K1NOqNRuKlsKl705UBJw\">@maybeiamamermaid</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjfaeGdUxkUDrEfygL1CdqQ\">@iiicurlingwavesiii</a></p><p><a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/148438393715/the-ultimate-masterlist\">MASTERLIST</a> &nbsp;| &nbsp;<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/174735659745/chapter-1-the-orb-avengers-x-femreader\">Chapter 1</a> &nbsp;| &nbsp;<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175071067210/chapter-2-currently-fearing-the-reaper-avengers\">Chapter 2</a> &nbsp;| &nbsp;<a href=\"https://original-wintersoldier.tumblr.com/post/175400908850/chapter-3-earth-is-closed-today-avengers-x\">Chapter 3</a></p><p>*please follow and let me know if you&rsquo;d like to be tagged.
