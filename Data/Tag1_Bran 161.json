We&rsquo;ve seen Jon fighting white walkers so we assume that he&rsquo;ll fight and shutter the Night King in a similar manner. The question is, where is Bran in all of this? Is he merely just there to see the Night King coming? Then why have they met on a metaphysical level, why does the Night King sense Bran, why did he try to kill him after Bloodraven died?</p><p>It&rsquo;s because Bran is the true key to humanity winning. People accept it to be Jon and Dany but I think the magic the Children used to turn a human to the Night King will need to be unraveled by someone powerful. I&rsquo;m also hoping that when it&rsquo;s all over, Bran can pull back from wherever his consciousness went and become himself again because I am not amused.</p><p>Also anon I hope you&rsquo;re disabled when you used cr***** because it&rsquo;s an ableist slur.</p>",

Although to be honest, even that isn\u2019t much of an excuse because Blood Raven seemed perfectly normal to me, albeit creepy. He didn\u2019t seem emotionally disconnected so I don\u2019t know why this choice was made in regards to Bran\u2019s character. Maybe it will pay off in some unforeseen way. One can only hope.\u00a0</p><p>On the whole, I\u2019d say they\u2019ve been pretty inconsistent with Bran\u2019s character and I don\u2019t think they have a great handle on his story. We know he will play a huge role in the War for the Dawn but people are scratching their heads at what that could be, aside from him being the Google of Winterfell. Part of it is that they probably want to save the endgame with WW as a huge twist but part, I suspect, is that they\u2019re not all that interested in Bran.\u00a0</p><p>If you look at Bran\u2019s story line, once he leaves Winterfell and particularly after the NW incident at Craster\u2019s keep, his arc is meandering and confusing, his character is stagnant and he\u2019s used as a exposition device for other stories (namely Jon\u2019s parentage reveal). Bran\u2019s story line in the books is steeped in symbolism, philosophical questions and being played out as a horror story (the Jojen paste being a prime example - one the show chose to eliminate). It doesn\u2019t mesh well with the Ds love for bombast and huge spectacle.\u00a0</p><p>Now, as to the reason behind Bran\u2019s interaction with Sansa \u2026 I think Bran took Sansa\u2019s amused comment as her not believing him and requiring further proof, hence him triggering her PTSD. It was meant to show not only Sansa that he was who he said he was but also show the audience his callousness in talking about that particular experience. It also added to the isolation Sansa felt through out season 7 and that was meant to increase the odds of her siding with LF in the audience\u2019s eyes. On a larger scale, it\u2019s sort of a strange thing but Sansa, the person who pushed for the reunion of her family the most, ends up being alienated from both Arya and Bran. Her only wholly positive relationship keeps being her relationship with Jon, which if Jonsa were to happen, would only increase the deep connection they have.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
