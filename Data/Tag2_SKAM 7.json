Oh, and Daphn\u00e9 is painting his nails.     </p><p>Something about it bringing out the color of his eyes. He doesn\u2019t exactly understand how that would work, seeing as his nails are nowhere near his eyes, but okay. She is using a dark blue nail polish. It\u2019s not like he actually protested it, and if he is completely honest, he kind of likes it. It\u2019s soothing, having someone paint your nails. And on top of that, focusing on what happens with his hands is a great distraction from all the guy talk. He is this close to joining in, it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have anything to complain about.\u00a0</p><p>Daphn\u00e9 is having trouble with his left thumb, and decides to take it off and start over. \u2018Why are you doing that for?\u2019 Lucas starts to complain, furrowing his brow whilst Daphn\u00e9 is carefully taking off the nail polish. \u2018Because, Lucas, once you mess up it\u2019s no use to just try and paint over it. You have to start over, a clean slate, otherwise the mess will just get bigger and bigger\u2019. He thinks this over. That\u2019s pretty poetic, if you think about it. It applies to most things in life. \u2018Wow. Deep.\u2019 He deadpans, grinning when Daphn\u00e9 shoots him a glare. Manon is laughing at them: \u2018Anyway, Lucas, how\u2019s your love life going? You\u2019ve been suspiciously quiet tonight\u2019 now it\u2019s his turn to glare. Why do they always insist in talking about his love life? There isn\u2019t anything to discus and if there was, he wouldn\u2019t want to discus it whilst someone was painting his freaking nails. \u2018Really, my love life is nonexistent. Nothing to share. Can someone please pass me the vodka?\u2019 Oh yeah, maybe the fact that they were drinking also helped with the whole \u2018sure, paint my nails\u2019 thing. He wasn\u2019t drunk, far from that, but he did feel a bit more relaxed. It took care of the edges.\u00a0</p><p>Manon hands him the bottle and he takes a swig just as she asks the inevitable question: \u2018So what\u2019s the deal with the new hot neighbor? Anything happened yet?\u2019 Why did he and his big mouth tell the girls about Eliott last time they hung out together? When will he ever learn? He takes one last pull of the bottle and sighs: \u2018Apart from the fact that we run into each other on the daily and I one time accidentally brushed his hand when he held the front door open for me when we arrived at the same time, nothing happened. I don\u2019t know, maybe I just imagined things\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>He can\u2019t get it out of his head, the first time they met: Eliott was moving in next door with the help of his friends, who he later learned are called Idriss and Sofiane. Lucas was just walking up the stairs, minding his own business, when all of the sudden he bumped into someone. He looked up (he will admit it was his fault: he was reading his mail) and saw that the person he bumped into was quite possibly the most attractive human being on this planet and no, he was not exaggerating. He was carrying a box of stuff and Lucas immediately felt like an asshole for not watching where he was going. Thankfully, Eliott didn\u2019t seem to mind it all that much, in facts, he actually apologized to Lucas even though it was clearly his fault to begin with. That was kind of the first clue he got that maybe Eliott would like him more than just a neighbor. T</p><p>he second thing was the fact that he introduced himself to him with the most intense stare he had ever seen: \u2018Oh I am really sorry about that. I am just moving in right now. I\u2019m Eliott.\u2019 For a second, all Lucas could do was nod stupidly, until his brain caught up with him: \u2018No worries, I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I\u2019m Lucas. Welcome to the building.\u2019 Eliott smiled brightly at that, and Lucas learned that whenever he smiled, his eyes turned into crescent moon. He had to talk to himself a couple of times in order to snap out of it, because quite frankly? He couldn\u2019t believe that Eliott was real, and that he was living next door, and that he was so nice to Lucas. Over the next couple of weeks, they exchanged pleasantries whenever they saw each other, and he could swear that he saw Eliott\u2019s gaze linger on him just a little bit too long from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>One time, they were both picking up their mail at the same time, and Eliott asked him about the invitation he was reading. It was just for some stupid party that Mika always liked to go to. When he explained that it was a party at a gayclub that his roommate made him go to, Eliott seemed to perk up ever so slightly. \u2018Oh, that could actually be fun. Are you going?\u2019 The thing was, he didn\u2019t really want to go, but the way Eliott said that\u2026 made him think maybe Eliott wanted to go. Which would make his interest in the party go up 100%, if he was being honest. So he tried to be brave: \u2018I might go, Mika asked me to go with him so yeah.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t result in Eliott saying he would also go, instead his face sort of faltered and he said something about being busy that weekend.\u00a0</p><p>When he thought back on that conversation, he could honestly kick himself. Because what if Eliott thought that Mika was his boyfriend? Then again, it was no use to speculate on why Eliott reacted the way that he did. He was a literal model, why would he give Lucas the time of day? In conclusion: he was pining after the most beautiful person he had ever seen, and it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Daphn\u00e9 started to talk through his thoughts: \u2018You know what, Lucas? You are a real catch, and if he can\u2019t see that, that\u2019s too bad for him. Look at your hands! This nail polish looks fabulous. Wait here and let them dry, Manon and I will go make some cocktails.\u2019 And with that, they went into the kitchen to see what they could make from the ingredients left in the fridge.\u00a0</p><p>He stared at his nails. It looked really weird. But\u2026 it could be worse. Huh. He was just about to ask if the girls could maybe bring back some snacks as well when there was a knock on the door. Lucas went to open it, careful not to chip his nails. When he opened the door, the last person he expected to stand on the other side was Eliott. But there he was. He looked sort of\u2026 nervous? What\u2019s going on? \u2018Hi. I\u2019m sorry to barge in on your night like this, but I remembered that tonight is that one party we talked about. The one where you were invited by your roommate? Or, at least, Manon explained that he was just your roommate when I bumped into her yesterday-\u2018 Lucas didn\u2019t think anything could make him like Eliott more than he already did, but seeing him being so vulnerable and shy? Yeah, that did things to him.\u00a0</p><p>Eliott had stopped in his tracks though, and was currently looking intently at the doorknob. \u2018Your nails\u2026\u2019 he trailed off. Of course he wasn\u2019t looking at the doorknob, he noticed his nails. Fuck why did he let Daphn\u00e9 do her thing? \u2018It\u2019s not what it looks like. Daphn\u00e9 insisted on painting them blue, because it would bring out my eyes or whatever.\u2019 Eliott shifts his gaze over to Lucas\u2019 eyes instead and oh god, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said that just now. \u2018Hm. Yeah. I see what she means. Your eyes are popping even more than usual.\u2019 Lucas is dumbfounded. How is this happening right now? Why did he drink vodka? Before he can respond, Eliott goes on: \u2018Anyway, I just wanted to see if you still wanted to go to that party, but it looks like you have other plans right now\u2019 Lucas feels Eliott\u2019s stare go over his entire body, it makes him tingle and feel things he can\u2019t even put into words. Maybe he isn\u2019t crazy after all. Maybe Eliott likes him. \u2018Yeah I can\u2019t ditch the girls right now, but maybe we could take a raincheck?\u2019 the nerves are building up in his stomach, but they feel like good nerves. Like something amazing is about to happen and he is on the brink of happiness. \u2018I\u2019d like that. Give me your number and we\u2019ll arrange something for next week?\u2019 Eliott asks, looking at him with those expressive eyes that seem to say so much. They exchange numbers, and when Lucas closes the door he gets a text almost right away: \u2018by the way, I meant what I said about your eyes. Blue really is your color, Daphn\u00e9 is on to something there\u2019 Lucas can\u2019t stop staring at his phone with the most obnoxious grin on his face. He doesn\u2019t even notice that Manon and Daphn\u00e9 are back from the kitchen with cocktails and snacks until he hears Manon say: \u2018What are you so happy about?\u2019 Lucas keeps on grinning and says: \u2018I might need some more style advice from you girls. These nails worked like a charm.\u2019 </p>",

He takes one last pull of the bottle and sighs: \u2018Apart from the fact that we run into each other on the daily and I one time accidentally brushed his hand when he held the front door open for me when we arrived at the same time, nothing happened. I don\u2019t know, maybe I just imagined things\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>He can\u2019t get it out of his head, the first time they met: Eliott was moving in next door with the help of his friends, who he later learned are called Idriss and Sofiane. Lucas was just walking up the stairs, minding his own business, when all of the sudden he bumped into someone. He looked up (he will admit it was his fault: he was reading his mail) and saw that the person he bumped into was quite possibly the most attractive human being on this planet and no, he was not exaggerating. He was carrying a box of stuff and Lucas immediately felt like an asshole for not watching where he was going. Thankfully, Eliott didn\u2019t seem to mind it all that much, in facts, he actually apologized to Lucas even though it was clearly his fault to begin with. That was kind of the first clue he got that maybe Eliott would like him more than just a neighbor. T</p><p>he second thing was the fact that he introduced himself to him with the most intense stare he had ever seen: \u2018Oh I am really sorry about that. I am just moving in right now. I\u2019m Eliott.\u2019 For a second, all Lucas could do was nod stupidly, until his brain caught up with him: \u2018No worries, I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I\u2019m Lucas. Welcome to the building.\u2019 Eliott smiled brightly at that, and Lucas learned that whenever he smiled, his eyes turned into crescent moon. He had to talk to himself a couple of times in order to snap out of it, because quite frankly? He couldn\u2019t believe that Eliott was real, and that he was living next door, and that he was so nice to Lucas. Over the next couple of weeks, they exchanged pleasantries whenever they saw each other, and he could swear that he saw Eliott\u2019s gaze linger on him just a little bit too long from time to time.\u00a0</p><p>One time, they were both picking up their mail at the same time, and Eliott asked him about the invitation he was reading. It was just for some stupid party that Mika always liked to go to. When he explained that it was a party at a gayclub that his roommate made him go to, Eliott seemed to perk up ever so slightly. \u2018Oh, that could actually be fun. Are you going?\u2019 The thing was, he didn\u2019t really want to go, but the way Eliott said that\u2026 made him think maybe Eliott wanted to go. Which would make his interest in the party go up 100%, if he was being honest. So he tried to be brave: \u2018I might go, Mika asked me to go with him so yeah.\u2019 But it didn\u2019t result in Eliott saying he would also go, instead his face sort of faltered and he said something about being busy that weekend.\u00a0</p><p>When he thought back on that conversation, he could honestly kick himself. Because what if Eliott thought that Mika was his boyfriend? Then again, it was no use to speculate on why Eliott reacted the way that he did. He was a literal model, why would he give Lucas the time of day? In conclusion: he was pining after the most beautiful person he had ever seen, and it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Daphn\u00e9 started to talk through his thoughts: \u2018You know what, Lucas? You are a real catch, and if he can\u2019t see that, that\u2019s too bad for him. Look at your hands! This nail polish looks fabulous. Wait here and let them dry, Manon and I will go make some cocktails.\u2019 And with that, they went into the kitchen to see what they could make from the ingredients left in the fridge.\u00a0</p><p>He stared at his nails. It looked really weird. But\u2026 it could be worse. Huh. He was just about to ask if the girls could maybe bring back some snacks as well when there was a knock on the door. Lucas went to open it, careful not to chip his nails. When he opened the door, the last person he expected to stand on the other side was Eliott. But there he was. He looked sort of\u2026 nervous? What\u2019s going on? \u2018Hi. I\u2019m sorry to barge in on your night like this, but I remembered that tonight is that one party we talked about. The one where you were invited by your roommate? Or, at least, Manon explained that he was just your roommate when I bumped into her yesterday-\u2018 Lucas didn\u2019t think anything could make him like Eliott more than he already did, but seeing him being so vulnerable and shy? Yeah, that did things to him.\u00a0</p><p>Eliott had stopped in his tracks though, and was currently looking intently at the doorknob. \u2018Your nails\u2026\u2019 he trailed off. Of course he wasn\u2019t looking at the doorknob, he noticed his nails. Fuck why did he let Daphn\u00e9 do her thing? \u2018It\u2019s not what it looks like. Daphn\u00e9 insisted on painting them blue, because it would bring out my eyes or whatever.\u2019 Eliott shifts his gaze over to Lucas\u2019 eyes instead and oh god, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said that just now. \u2018Hm. Yeah. I see what she means. Your eyes are popping even more than usual.\u2019 Lucas is dumbfounded. How is this happening right now? Why did he drink vodka? Before he can respond, Eliott goes on: \u2018Anyway, I just wanted to see if you still wanted to go to that party, but it looks like you have other plans right now\u2019 Lucas feels Eliott\u2019s stare go over his entire body, it makes him tingle and feel things he can\u2019t even put into words. Maybe he isn\u2019t crazy after all. Maybe Eliott likes him. \u2018Yeah I can\u2019t ditch the girls right now, but maybe we could take a raincheck?\u2019 the nerves are building up in his stomach, but they feel like good nerves. Like something amazing is about to happen and he is on the brink of happiness. \u2018I\u2019d like that. Give me your number and we\u2019ll arrange something for next week?\u2019 Eliott asks, looking at him with those expressive eyes that seem to say so much. They exchange numbers, and when Lucas closes the door he gets a text almost right away: \u2018by the way, I meant what I said about your eyes. Blue really is your color, Daphn\u00e9 is on to something there\u2019 Lucas can\u2019t stop staring at his phone with the most obnoxious grin on his face. He doesn\u2019t even notice that Manon and Daphn\u00e9 are back from the kitchen with cocktails and snacks until he hears Manon say: \u2018What are you so happy about?\u2019 Lucas keeps on grinning and says: \u2018I might need some more style advice from you girls. These nails worked like a charm.\u2019 </p>",

It\u2019s not like he actually protested it, and if he is completely honest, he kind of likes it. It\u2019s soothing, having someone paint your nails.

You have to start over, a clean slate, otherwise the mess will just get bigger and bigger\u2019. He thinks this over. That\u2019s pretty poetic, if you think about it. It applies to most things in life. \u2018Wow. Deep.\u2019 He deadpans, grinning when Daphn\u00e9 shoots him a glare. Manon is laughing at them: \u2018Anyway, Lucas, how\u2019s your love life going? You\u2019ve been suspiciously quiet tonight\u2019 now it\u2019s his turn to glare. Why do they always insist in talking about his love life? There isn\u2019t anything to discus and if there was, he wouldn\u2019t want to discus it whilst someone was painting his freaking nails. \u2018Really, my love life is nonexistent. Nothing to share.

Give me your number and we&rsquo;ll arrange something for next week?&rsquo; Eliott asks, looking at him with those expressive eyes that seem to say so much. They exchange numbers, and when Lucas closes the door he gets a text almost right away: &lsquo;by the way, I meant what I said about your eyes. Blue really is your color, Daphn&eacute; is on to something there&rsquo; Lucas can&rsquo;t stop staring at his phone with the most obnoxious grin on his face. He doesn&rsquo;t even notice that Manon and Daphn&eacute; are back from the kitchen with cocktails and snacks until he hears Manon say: &lsquo;What are you so happy about?&rsquo; Lucas keeps on grinning and says: &lsquo;I might need some more style advice from you girls. These nails worked like a charm.&rsquo; </p>",

How he&rsquo;d much rather be at the <i>coloc, </i>with his boyfriend and his friends&mdash; who have quickly become his friends, too.</p><p>He senses her presence before he looks up.</p><p>When he sees her, a scowl etches its way across his face before he can help it.</p><p>&ldquo;Lucille.&rdquo; He says, his voice flat, hiding his emotions as best as he can.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I sit?&rdquo; She asks, her voice quiet. She&rsquo;s changed, even in the couple of months since they saw each other last. There&rsquo;s something&hellip; <i>smaller, </i>about her. Her presence isn&rsquo;t quite as demanding and as large as it had always been.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that why we&rsquo;re here?&rdquo; He asks, already knowing the answer. She smiles sadly down at him before sitting down at the opposite side of the table.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to apologize.&rdquo; He knows she wanted to meet him about this. He had seen it coming since she tried to call Lucas all those months ago.</p><p>&ldquo;You wanted to apologize.&rdquo; He nearly scoffs, when he speaks.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. For everything.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so sincere that he almost lets it affect him. &ldquo;I should have been more aware of how bad things were, between us.&rdquo; He thinks of all of the yelling, all of the silence. He thinks of the tension that never left when they were together. He thinks of the fact that, at the height of it, he was almost scared of her. <i>Almost.</i> &ldquo;I guess I stayed because we had been together for so long, because it was easier than realizing that we were coming to an end.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s taken aback, then. His thoughts pause because Lucille has just voiced an exact thought that he&rsquo;s had over and over and over again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for restraining you, for making you feel like you were held back by me.&rdquo; He wishes an apology were enough. She&rsquo;s hit the nail on the head, and he wishes her apology changed something. He&rsquo;s not sure what sort of change he&rsquo;s hoping for, but no change comes. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m especially sorry for the things I said to Lucas.&rdquo; At the mention of Lucas&rsquo; name, all of the anger from a moment ago comes rushing back. It floods his body until he&rsquo;s full of it. &ldquo;It made me so angry to see you happy with someone else, but it wasn&rsquo;t because of you. It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p><p><i>You think I blame myself for this? </i>He wants to say. <i>You think you making him cry was my fault? </i>He remembers Lucas crying as he told him about the conversation he had with Lucille on the houseboat&mdash; and he remembers the rage that he felt as a consequence.</p><p>&ldquo;You told him that I didn&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo; He tells her through gritted teeth. &ldquo;You told him that I <i>couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;</i>I know, And I know I&rsquo;ll never be able to apologize enough for that.&rdquo; He sees the tears begin to fall, and he seethes. <i>You don&rsquo;t have the right to cry, not about this.&nbsp;</i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I was feeling, then. I was scared and <i>angry </i>and I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how to explain myself. If you hate me, I understand.&rdquo; He looks at her, then looks away. <i>Deep breaths.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate you.&rdquo; He says, and it&rsquo;s the most honest thing he&rsquo;s said throughout this entire conversation. &ldquo;I wish I could hate you, but I don&rsquo;t hate you. I don&rsquo;t forgive you, though.&rdquo; He gets up, now, and he doesn&rsquo;t care if his coffee is still half-full&mdash; this conversation is finished. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say things like that, to <i>anyone</i>&mdash; let alone the people I care about&mdash; and expect forgiveness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope this helped you, though.&rdquo; He shrugs a little bit, and it diffuses the tension, if only slightly, if only for him. &ldquo;That you got something out of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; not sure.&rdquo; Lucille says. She&rsquo;s still sitting, and he turns to leave, then. He knows that she&rsquo;s letting him go. For the first time, she&rsquo;s giving him the last word, the last move.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you find peace, Lucille,&rdquo; <i>I&rsquo;m sorry, </i>he almost says, but doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;s done giving her apologies.</p><p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t be the one to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>",

Herman really gave off that fuckboy type vibes and he was just so&hellip;&hellip; handsome. I mean, just look at him. God\u2019s gift to the human race. I really like Cris from Skam Espa\u00f1a too. I had this weird dream about him and I\u2019ve been in love with him since then.</p><p>3. <b>Favourite season of the OG (i\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what you meant)</b></p><p>It\u2019s a tie between the second and the fourth season. I like the 2nd one not because of the \u2018good girl, bad boy\u2019 thing. I was never into that concept in the first place. But their relationship was really deep. It went deeper than everything. It was about two people being lonely and how they perceive the world. While Noora had a very optimistic approach to everything, William thought that world was black and white and that the only way to survive in this world is to become and act like a total asshole. They had their own versions of messed up family. They found families in their friends and in each other- that\u2019s the most beautiful thing ever, tbh. More than that, they both KNEW how different they were from each other yet they tried to understand each other. So&hellip; I mean, it was super nice. As for Yousef and Sana. Yousef is the best character written in the history of television. I\u2019m not a very big fan of Sana because she\u2019s just too cold and closed off for my liking but god damn I ship Yousana so hard. I loved Sana when she was with Yousef. I loved who she was with him. She tried to understand what other people think. She realised that she was not right always. These two were just so&hellip; pure. And their relationship was beautiful. Again, it\u2019s because of how different they were yet they tried to understand each other.</p><p>4. <b>Which character would you go on a date with</b></p><p>Uhm&hellip;..</p><p>Yousef, Gio, Edo, Senne, Cris</p><p><br/></p><p>5. <b>From which country would you like to see a version of skam</b></p><p>Any Asian country.

Every single one of them seems so fun to be around and of course, Gio. I love him. Period.</p><p><br></p><p>2. <b>Favourite version of P Chris</b></p><p>The og. Herman really gave off that fuckboy type vibes and he was just so\u2026\u2026 handsome. I mean, just look at him. God\u2019s gift to the human race. I really like Cris from Skam Espa\u00f1a too. I had this weird dream about him and I\u2019ve been in love with him since then.</p><p>3. <b>Favourite season of the OG (i\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what you meant)</b></p><p>It\u2019s a tie between the second and the fourth season. I like the 2nd one not because of the \u2018good girl, bad boy\u2019 thing. I was never into that concept in the first place. But their relationship was really deep. It went deeper than everything. It was about two people being lonely and how they perceive the world. While Noora had a very optimistic approach to everything, William thought that world was black and white and that the only way to survive in this world is to become and act like a total asshole. They had their own versions of messed up family. They found families in their friends and in each other- that\u2019s the most beautiful thing ever, tbh. More than that, they both KNEW how different they were from each other yet they tried to understand each other. So\u2026 I mean, it was super nice. As for Yousef and Sana. Yousef is the best character written in the history of television. I\u2019m not a very big fan of Sana because she\u2019s just too cold and closed off for my liking but god damn I ship Yousana so hard. I loved Sana when she was with Yousef. I loved who she was with him. She tried to understand what other people think. She realised that she was not right always. These two were just so\u2026 pure. And their relationship was beautiful. Again, it\u2019s because of how different they were yet they tried to understand each other.</p><p>4. <b>Which character would you go on a date with</b></p><p>Uhm\u2026..</p><p>Yousef, Gio, Edo, Senne, Cris</p><p><br></p><p>5. <b>From which country would you like to see a version of skam</b></p><p>Any Asian country.

        "body": "<h1>Seven Days (Part 3 of 7)</h1><p>Lucas felt warm hands over his eyes. He knew immediately who it was, and a wide grin splayed across his face.</p><p>\u201cYann?\u201d he asked, jokingly.</p><p>\u201cYou were waiting on Yann?\u201d Eliott asked, eyebrows raised in mock consternation.</p><p>\u201cI knew it was you, and no, I was waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>Eliott smiled and kissed him on the lips, then the temple, as he sat next to Lucas on the bench.</p><p>\u201cTwo more weeks, and we\u2019re done for the summer!\u201d Eliott exclaimed as he sat his backpack down and flung his arms into the air.</p><p>Lucas giggled at his exuberance. He would, of course, be returning for his last year after summer break, but Eliott would be going on to Uni. Lucas was saddened a bit by the thought of that. He knew they would still see each other, but Eliott would no longer be at the same school, and he would of course be making new friends, starting a life that wouldn\u2019t include Lucas.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, mon amour?\u201d Eliott asked.</p><p>Lucas shook himself from his worrisome musings. This week was about Eliott. They were taking it minute by minute, and he wouldn\u2019t worry about the future when they had right now to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d he answered, grabbing Eliott by the hands to lift him off the bench, \u201cbut we have to get a move on. We have somewhere to be in less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>Eliott looked over at him in surprise. \u201cI thought we were just heading home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Lucas asked. He knew Eliott was a little stressed because of Bac exams. Lucas had been stressed himself over his own exams. So much had happened over the last few months with him and his friends, and school had taken a backseat to all the drama.  Plus, he had skipped a few classes to spend more time with Eliott. It had been worth it.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Eliott said with a smile. \u201cJust didn\u2019t know you had something planned for today.\u201d</p><p>Usually, they would be getting ready to kick off the weekend at a club or house party, but Lucas had something a little more laid back planned for the afternoon since Eliott still had a couple more exams to take the following week.</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip;where are we going?\u201d Eliott asked, as they walked up to the bus stop that would take them in the opposite direction of the flat. \u201cSome new club&hellip;out to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember a few months ago when you wouldn\u2019t tell me where you were taking me?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>Eliott chuckled. \u201cSo you\u2019re getting me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you said, and I loosely quote, \u2018the only correct answer is&hellip;I\u2019ll go wherever you go\u2019,\u201d Lucas jokingly chided.</p><p>\u201cYou were the dork quoting Celine Dion&hellip;and you joke about my love of Dubstep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCeline Dion is an international treasure&hellip;a treasure, you hear me.\u201d Lucas paused, a mischievous glint in his eye, \u201cI was actually thinking about making you a playlist of her greatest hits for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>Eliott huffed out a laugh. Then he paused as he grabbed Lucas by the face and started to sing, \u201cYou were my strength when I was weak&hellip;you were my voice when I couldn\u2019t speak&hellip;\u201d </p><p>Eliott\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t strong, but he admittedly had a nice singing voice.  Lucas felt like it was supposed to be a joke, but Eliott\u2019s face was serious. Lucas felt his eyes sting a little. He would not cry at this damn bus stop over a Celine Dion song. </p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he said softly, as he kissed Eliott on his open mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re such a cornball,\u201d he continued, burying his face in Eliott\u2019s jacket.</p><p>Lucas felt Eliott\u2019s chest rise and fall in silent laughter, as he wrapped his long arms around Lucas. They stood like that for a minute. Other riders joined them at the stop, but they were in their own private world. The bus pulled to the curb, and they boarded, now holding hands.</p><p>They passed several stops before they finally arrived at the right one. \u201cOk, we\u2019re here,\u201d Lucas said, as they stood to exit behind others who were getting off as well.</p><p>A few blocks later and they were standing at a tour place in Central Paris. Lucas had booked a horse and open carriage ride for them.</p><p>\u201cI know how much you like seeing and talking about all the little known Parisian architectural facts, so you can regale me tonight&hellip;and I won\u2019t give you a hard time like I usually do.\u201d</p><p>Eliott was beaming. Lucas always teased him because when they hung out in the city with friends, Eliott would often point out historical facts about buildings or bridges that no one else knew about, although most of them had grown up in Paris. </p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;like last time when you mocked me, \u2018and there is the Eiffel Tower and right there, the Arc de Triomphe!\u2019,\u201d Eliott jokingly chided him. \u201cYou really hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually love when you tell us about history and art&hellip;I get to show off my brilliant boyfriend,\u201d Lucas admitted. </p><p>Although he gave him a hard time, sometimes he would just listen to Eliott wax on about the different buildings, bridges, or tunnels, mesmerized by how much Eliott knew about each one. It was like seeing Paris for the first time through the eyes of someone who fell in love with the same city over and over again. It made Lucas appreciate his city more.</p><p>\u201cI just think that every city is like a real person. So real, you could draw them. Paris is an older woman, stylish&hellip;still very beautiful, but much wiser. She has known pain, but that pain has made her, in many ways, more beautiful than in her youth&hellip;,\u201d Eliott paused, seemingly embarrassed by his talk. \u201cAnyway&hellip;this is nice.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grabbed Eliott\u2019s hands. \u201cThat was really beautiful&hellip;what you said about cities&hellip;about Paris. It makes me feel better about this idea. I thought it might be too touristy and corny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d Eliott said, as they walked up to the counter. \u201cI love it&hellip;and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Lucas replied. He grabbed Eliott\u2019s hand as they confirmed their ride and walked to the waiting area.</p><p>It was a perfect Parisian afternoon as the carriage made its way through Central Paris. At first, Eliott pointed out architectural details and mentioned historical anecdotes.  Lucas listened, enthralled, at peace.  </p><p>Halfway through the ride, Eliott pulled Lucas closer and became silent. He no longer looked at the sites around them, just stared intently at Lucas.</p><p>Lucas felt his stomach lurch and couldn\u2019t help but smile from ear to ear. He <i>was</i> a dork and so gone for his beautiful boyfriend sitting beside him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t pay much attention to the driver or anything else for the last leg of the tour. They were too busy discovering new ways to kiss and touch each other, appreciating the soft architecture of each other\u2019s face, lips, hands.  Soon the driver was also silent, a soft smile on his lips. The Day 3 gift had been a success, Lucas thought to himself, four more days to go.</p>",

Lucas always teased him because when they hung out in the city with friends, Eliott would often point out historical facts about buildings or bridges that no one else knew about, although most of them had grown up in Paris. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026like last time when you mocked me, \u2018and there is the Eiffel Tower and right there, the Arc de Triomphe!\u2019,\u201d Eliott jokingly chided him. \u201cYou really hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually love when you tell us about history and art\u2026I get to show off my brilliant boyfriend,\u201d Lucas admitted. </p><p>Although he gave him a hard time, sometimes he would just listen to Eliott wax on about the different buildings, bridges, or tunnels, mesmerized by how much Eliott knew about each one. It was like seeing Paris for the first time through the eyes of someone who fell in love with the same city over and over again. It made Lucas appreciate his city more.</p><p>\u201cI just think that every city is like a real person. So real, you could draw them. Paris is an older woman, stylish\u2026still very beautiful, but much wiser. She has known pain, but that pain has made her, in many ways, more beautiful than in her youth\u2026,\u201d Eliott paused, seemingly embarrassed by his talk. \u201cAnyway\u2026this is nice.\u201d</p><p>Lucas grabbed Eliott\u2019s hands. \u201cThat was really beautiful\u2026what you said about cities\u2026about Paris. It makes me feel better about this idea. I thought it might be too touristy and corny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d Eliott said, as they walked up to the counter. \u201cI love it\u2026and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Lucas replied. He grabbed Eliott\u2019s hand as they confirmed their ride and walked to the waiting area.</p><p>It was a perfect Parisian afternoon as the carriage made its way through Central Paris. At first, Eliott pointed out architectural details and mentioned historical anecdotes.  Lucas listened, enthralled, at peace.  </p><p>Halfway through the ride, Eliott pulled Lucas closer and became silent. He no longer looked at the sites around them, just stared intently at Lucas.</p><p>Lucas felt his stomach lurch and couldn\u2019t help but smile from ear to ear. He <i>was</i> a dork and so gone for his beautiful boyfriend sitting beside him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t pay much attention to the driver or anything else for the last leg of the tour. They were too busy discovering new ways to kiss and touch each other, appreciating the soft architecture of each other\u2019s face, lips, hands.  Soon the driver was also silent, a soft smile on his lips. The Day 3 gift had been a success, Lucas thought to himself, four more days to go.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Seven Days (Part 3 of 7)</h1><p>Lucas felt warm hands over his eyes. He knew immediately who it was, and a wide grin splayed across his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yann?&rdquo; he asked, jokingly.</p><p>&ldquo;You were waiting on Yann?&rdquo; Eliott asked, eyebrows raised in mock consternation.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it was you, and no, I was waiting on you.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott smiled and kissed him on the lips, then the temple, as he sat next to Lucas on the bench.</p><p>&ldquo;Two more weeks, and we&rsquo;re done for the summer!&rdquo; Eliott exclaimed as he sat his backpack down and flung his arms into the air.</p><p>Lucas giggled at his exuberance. He would, of course, be returning for his last year after summer break, but Eliott would be going on to Uni. Lucas was saddened a bit by the thought of that. He knew they would still see each other, but Eliott would no longer be at the same school, and he would of course be making new friends, starting a life that wouldn&rsquo;t include Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s bothering you, mon amour?&rdquo; Eliott asked.</p><p>Lucas shook himself from his worrisome musings. This week was about Eliott. They were taking it minute by minute, and he wouldn&rsquo;t worry about the future when they had right now to celebrate.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; he answered, grabbing Eliott by the hands to lift him off the bench, &ldquo;but we have to get a move on. We have somewhere to be in less than an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott looked over at him in surprise. &ldquo;I thought we were just heading home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; Lucas asked. He knew Eliott was a little stressed because of Bac exams. Lucas had been stressed himself over his own exams. So much had happened over the last few months with him and his friends, and school had taken a backseat to all the drama.  Plus, he had skipped a few classes to spend more time with Eliott. It had been worth it.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Eliott said with a smile. &ldquo;Just didn&rsquo;t know you had something planned for today.&rdquo;</p><p>Usually, they would be getting ready to kick off the weekend at a club or house party, but Lucas had something a little more laid back planned for the afternoon since Eliott still had a couple more exams to take the following week.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;where are we going?&rdquo; Eliott asked, as they walked up to the bus stop that would take them in the opposite direction of the flat. &ldquo;Some new club&hellip;out to eat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember a few months ago when you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me where you were taking me?&rdquo; Lucas asked.</p><p>Eliott chuckled. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re getting me back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe you said, and I loosely quote, &lsquo;the only correct answer is&hellip;I&rsquo;ll go wherever you go&rsquo;,&rdquo; Lucas jokingly chided.</p><p>&ldquo;You were the dork quoting Celine Dion&hellip;and you joke about my love of Dubstep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Celine Dion is an international treasure&hellip;a treasure, you hear me.&rdquo; Lucas paused, a mischievous glint in his eye, &ldquo;I was actually thinking about making you a playlist of her greatest hits for your birthday.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott huffed out a laugh. Then he paused as he grabbed Lucas by the face and started to sing, &ldquo;You were my strength when I was weak&hellip;you were my voice when I couldn&rsquo;t speak&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Eliott&rsquo;s voice wasn&rsquo;t strong, but he admittedly had a nice singing voice.  Lucas felt like it was supposed to be a joke, but Eliott&rsquo;s face was serious. Lucas felt his eyes sting a little. He would not cry at this damn bus stop over a Celine Dion song. </p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; he said softly, as he kissed Eliott on his open mouth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a cornball,&rdquo; he continued, burying his face in Eliott&rsquo;s jacket.</p><p>Lucas felt Eliott&rsquo;s chest rise and fall in silent laughter, as he wrapped his long arms around Lucas. They stood like that for a minute. Other riders joined them at the stop, but they were in their own private world. The bus pulled to the curb, and they boarded, now holding hands.</p><p>They passed several stops before they finally arrived at the right one. &ldquo;Ok, we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Lucas said, as they stood to exit behind others who were getting off as well.</p><p>A few blocks later and they were standing at a tour place in Central Paris.
