The team had a mission to go on and this time you both weren&rsquo;t called in. It felt great to finally just walk around holding hands, cuddling and giving kisses out in the open instead of keeping everything locked away.</p><p>The both of you have been dating for several months, and you kept it a secret from the team. It&rsquo;s not that you were scared or worried about them finding out about your relationship with the assassin. You two just liked to keep it between yourselves, it was your business and no one else&rsquo;s. Though if everyone found out how soft Nat got around a pretty girl, they wouldn&rsquo;t let her live it down. Though they&rsquo;d second guess themselves once they got the beating they would receive later when you weren&rsquo;t in the same room.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a week since the team had been out and they were scheduled to come back in the next two days. The past week has been a wonderful one. It was like you and Nat had your own place, a small taste of normal life. No fighting villains or worrying about all the other men living in the same space. It was a nice break from everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Quiet breakfasts and nice dinner dates every other night. It was very fun learning how to make some new dishes with your stubborn girlfriend. It took some convincing to let her put you in charge of the stove, though you knew she was just worried since the last time you worked on the stove you accidentally burned your hand a little.</p><p>Today was just a lazy day, you both did not have errands to run or plans with others so you watched random movies all day. Lounging on the couch, you weren&rsquo;t really paying attention to the movie playing on the screen. Your full attention was on the beautiful blonde who was resting on your lap, your fingers gently combing through her hair.&nbsp;</p><p>Smiling when you saw her close her eyes at the soothing touch. Nat turned and opened her eyes catching your gaze. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that goofy look on your face, (Y/n)?&rdquo; Your smile widened when she looked up at you.&nbsp;</p><p>You still couldn&rsquo;t believe someone as amazing as Natasha was with you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, I was just thinking of how lucky I am to be with someone as amazing as you Nat.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha sat up and adjusted herself to sit on your lap. Facing you, her arms lazily wrap around your neck. Leaning her forehead on yours, noses brushing up against each other. A small giggle wanted to escape you as you felt some of her hair tickle your cheeks. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give yourself enough credit (Y/n). You&rsquo;re the most beautiful, kind, patient and amazing girl I&rsquo;ve ever met. I&rsquo;m the one lucky to have you.&rdquo; Nat leaned in placing her lips on yours in a sweet sensual kiss.</p><p>You placed your hands on her hips reciprocating the kiss pulling her body a little bit closer. When you two did pull away after a few minutes catching your breath you felt Nat trail kisses over your cheek, jawline, and down to your neck. </p><p>Letting out a small whimper when she brushed her lips against your weak spot by your ear, you could feel her smirking against your skin as the heat rose to your cheeks. &ldquo;N-Nat baby I think we should continue this in my room.&rdquo; Natasha moved to stand up grabbing your hand eagerly pulling you up with her leading the way to your bedroom.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Shifting in your sheets as the sun came into your room you turned so you were facing your sleeping girlfriend. You smiled at her sleeping form and started to feel the pull of sleep weighing on you again, gladly letting it take over. It wasn&rsquo;t long after that you had fallen back asleep that Natasha woke up lightly kissing your cheek and carefully getting out of bed so she wouldn&rsquo;t wake you. Grabbing her sweats and the first shirt she saw she quickly put it on and walked out of your room wanting to surprise you with breakfast. Natasha walked into the living room that&rsquo;s connected to the kitchen failing to notice the group sitting/laying around on the couches and bean bag chairs.</p><p>Tony was the first one to speak up. &ldquo;Well, It looks like you and (Y/n) a fun week together, we saw you coming out of her room.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha quickly turned around facing Tony giving him a piercing glare. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your shit right now Tony. Also weren&rsquo;t you all supposed to return in another day?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Steve spoke up from his lying position on one of the couches. &ldquo;Mission ended early, we gathered up things quicker than expected so they gave us the okay to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony was about to speak again until everyone&rsquo;s attention turned to you as you walked into the living room. Curious and tired looks were directed your way but no one spoke up. Rubbing the sleep you still had in your eyes away, you yawned slowly processing what was going on. &ldquo;Oh shit hey guys, your back pretty early did the mission go well?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Clint just nodded a simple yes and everyone was looking at Natasha as she made her way towards you sliding her arm around your waist giving the team a look that could kill if they said anything inappropriate about all this.&nbsp;</p><p>Wanda spoke up smiling at the two of you, &ldquo;So you two are together? You&rsquo;re dating?!&rdquo; She said with a bit of excitement in voice.</p><p>You and Natasha looked at each other and smiled knowing it&rsquo;s no use hiding it now. &ldquo;Yes, Wanda we are dating, have been for several months now.&rdquo; Tony chuckled a bit and saw you turn to look at him &ldquo;Well at least we know Nat loves you considering your neck is covered with all her spider bites&rdquo;</p><p>You wanted to say something but Nat started to pull you away back towards your room &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth it babe. Let&rsquo;s just go get changed and I&rsquo;ll take us out for breakfast sound good?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You giggled as you stepped into your room &ldquo;Sounds perfect sweetheart. &nbsp;Anything to avoid an awkward conversation first thing in the morning&rdquo; Nat gave you a quick peck to your lips and you two got ready to head out and enjoy another day together.</p>",
