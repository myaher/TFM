It wasn\u2019t an unusual thing; Friday nights usually left him with pent up excitement and a need to get out of his dingy dorm. He\u2019d never considered himself a club person, usually preferring a quiet pub where he could get as pissed as he wanted and still be able to find someone tall and gorgeous to drag home.</p><p>Tonight, though, he\u2019d been walking past a club and its obnoxiously long line, and he had spotted him - who he now knew to be Phil. He\u2019d been standing there next to a short blonde girl with her arm wrapped around his and smiling up all excited at him.</p><p>Normally he wouldn&rsquo;t mess with someone who had a significant other, but there was something about this guy. Maybe it was the pushed up black quiff and thick rimmed glasses. Maybe it was that stupid button up shirt that was decorated in tiny dogs. Dan watched as he lifted his head to the sky and let out the most joyful laugh Dan had ever heard, and that\u2019s when he made up his mind. He wanted to see this guy with his head thrown back, but because of Dan, and what he knew he was good at.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t have to wait in line because he knew all the bouncers in town, thanks to his compulsive weekend habits. He took up post at the bar, just biding his time.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before the man was in view, making his way to the bar. Dan had deliberately kept the seat next to him empty, making it the only available spot for his conquest to come to. Dan watched as he whispered something in the girl\u2019s ear and they split ways - the man coming towards the spot next to Dan and the girl moving toward the tables lining the dance floor. It was like Dan had planned it - which he guessed he sort of did. Guys, especially the ones who looked nice, were easy to predict. No decent guy made his girl stand in line for drinks.</p><p>When he approached the seat and tapped on Dan\u2019s shoulder to see if it was available, Dan gestured for him to take a seat and gave him an inviting smile. His answering blush was just a tick on the list of things that Dan suspected about him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d the bartender asked him, voice loud over the thumping bass.</p><p>\u201cTwo tequila sunrises, please!\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t miss the way the man\u2019s eyes glanced over to him frequently. He didn\u2019t bother hiding his own gaze, though - subtly wasn\u2019t something he knew or understood. If you wanted something, why not just go for it?</p><p>\u201cDo you come here a lot?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t something that Dan expected. He raised his eyebrows at the man, a surprised smile tugging at his lips.</p><p>\u201cNot especially,\u201d Dan relied. \u201cI\u2019m more of a pub or house party kinda guy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and fiddled with the napkin in his hand. He glanced up at Dan and then back down again before speaking. \u201cWhat brings you in tonight, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>It was the type of thing that could really have two reactions: disgust and an upturned nose. Or - the blush and sharp intake of breath that was happening now.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Dan cocked his head to the side and made no effort to hide the trail of his eyes down his body. It was a nice body - tall, broad shoulders, nice arms and probably a nice ass, given how the sides of his hips flared out.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he chuckled, cheeks still a delicious pink.</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything else as the bartender placed his drinks down on the bar. Dan watched as he picked them up and gave Dan one last lingering look before walking over to the blonde girl and the table she had scored.</p><p>Dan watched as he sat down and they started talking, but looked away after a second. There was surely someone else just as attractive in the club, right? He wasn\u2019t worried that he wouldn\u2019t find anyone. He was just vain enough to know that he was attractive and could pull just about anyone he wanted - one of the few exceptions was sitting across the bar, full pink lips wrapped around a straw.</p><p>Not that Dan was still looking, of course.</p><p>-</p><p>It was probably close to an hour later when Dan spotted him again. Tired of sitting, Dan had walked on to the dance floor and started moving to the music, letting the sting of tequila still burning his throat carry him to the beat. It wasn\u2019t the type of music he usually preferred, but it was loud with a decent rhythm and he could move his hips to it.</p><p>At some point an arm wrapped around his waist - some tall guy whose features weren\u2019t really what Dan usually went for, but he was cute enough that a few more drinks could persuade him into falling into bed with them.</p><p>He spotted the black haired man not long after, the blonde girl nowhere to be seen. He was coming onto the floor, near enough that Dan could see him, and see that he was watching Dan. He was alone, so Dan pulled away from his replacement and moved towards him.</p><p>\u201cWant to dance?\u201d he asked, surprising Dan again.</p><p>Dan nodded and pulled the man towards him, their hips close enough that Dan could feel the heat of his body.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked into the shell of Dan\u2019s ear, making an involuntary shiver run down his spine.</p><p>\u201cDan.\u201d</p><p>He smirked a little, eyes crinkling in the corners. \u201cI\u2019m Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Phil.\u201d Dan didn\u2019t bother with any more words, just pulled him even closer and let the beat carry them for a while.</p><p>-</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for them to move from dancing to just pressing up against each other and grinding, to pushing Phil up against the wall and kissing him like their lives depended on it. He tasted like tequila and cherry, courtesy of his drink from earlier, and Dan lapped it up.</p><p>In a bolder move than Dan would have expected from this sweet, but meek, boy in front of him, Phil\u2019s hand slipped down between their bodies, moving to the front and cupping Dan\u2019s growing erection. The air in his lungs was punched out of him and he thrusted his hips forward, instantly wanting more of what Phil was giving him.</p><p>He pulled back, taking in the color high on Phil\u2019s cheeks and the way his lips were shiny and puffy from kissing, and he made a gut decision, pulling him into the closest place with a door to it.</p><p>-</p><p>And now here they were: Dan on his knees and Phil above him, head thrown back just as Dan had pictured, and it was even better than he could have imagined. He wasn\u2019t vocal, but that didn\u2019t stop little grunts and whimpers leaving him as Dan took him deeper and deeper.</p><p>At some point, Phil\u2019s hands had threaded through Dan\u2019s sweaty locks, probably just for purchase, but as Dan swirled his tongue around the head of Phil\u2019s leaking cock, he had pulled hard enough that a twinge of pain traveled through Dan, along with a rush of pleasure. He was already painfully hard and that did nothing to help.</p><p>\u201cFuck, sorry,\u201d Phil panted above him, and Dan pulled his mouth away just long enough to tell him it was fine, that he liked it, and resumed his work.</p><p>That seemed to be all the encouragement he needed because after that, he gripped and pulled and Dan was in heaven. The only thing that would make it better was if Phil\u2019s hands were on him in less innocent places.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil mumbled, \u201cDan, I\u2019m gonna come.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try and push Dan off, which Dan somehow just found hotter. He let Dan work him faster, and twist his wrist until Phil was hissing and his hips were thrusting forward into the hot heat of Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Once he was sure Phil was finished, evident in the way he whined with overstimulation when Dan ran his tongue over his slit once more, he sat back on his legs so Phil could watch as he swallowed all that Phil had given him, licking his lips after.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Phil looked like a wreck, and absolutely looked like he\u2019d just been blown in the mens\u2019 room, but it was a good look on him. It reminded Dan how painfully hard he was.</p><p>Phil seemed to think of this, too, because he grabbed Dan by the arms and helped him up, slamming him against the stall door that gave a small tremble from his weight. He wasted no time snaking his hands down to Dan\u2019s belt and undoing the buckle. His eyes, blue, Dan realized, were boring into his, searching for any sign that Dan wasn\u2019t okay. He was more than okay, though, pressing Phil\u2019s hand closer so he could feel just how much this whole thing had affected him. How much <i>Phil</i> affected him.</p><p>-</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before Dan was spilling over Phil\u2019s large, wonderful hands. After Phil wiped his hands off on the toilet roll in the stall, they both stood there, trying to catch their breath.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna come back to mine?\u201d Phil asked, surprising him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you gave a girlfriend you\u2019re supposed to be getting back to?\u201d</p><p>Phil looked confused. \u201cOh! You mean Rose? No, that\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Dan squinted at him. He didn\u2019t really do the whole \u2018going home with someone\u2019 thing, but there was something about Phil, even though he knew that was one hell of a clich\u00e9.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The surprise that painted Phil\u2019s face was worth going out of his comfort zone. He placed a chaste kiss on Dan\u2019s cheek and opened the stall door, pulling Dan towards uncharted territory that he was actually kind of excited to explore.</p>",

There was probably some part of him that had known when he left the house that night that he <i>could</i> end up in the grimy bathroom of the club that he had walked into, but he certainly hadn\u2019t <i>planned</i> on it.</p><p>He also hadn\u2019t planned on meeting probably the hottest guy he\u2019d ever seen, either. But here he was, swallowing down the man\u2019s generous length so far back it made him choke, and all he knew about the guy was that his name was \u201cPhil\u201d and he had a certain fondness for tequila and button up shirts.</p>[[MORE]]<p>-</p><p>Dan was keyed up with energy when he left his apartment that night. It wasn\u2019t an unusual thing; Friday nights usually left him with pent up excitement and a need to get out of his dingy dorm. He\u2019d never considered himself a club person, usually preferring a quiet pub where he could get as pissed as he wanted and still be able to find someone tall and gorgeous to drag home.</p><p>Tonight, though, he\u2019d been walking past a club and its obnoxiously long line, and he had spotted him - who he now knew to be Phil. He\u2019d been standing there next to a short blonde girl with her arm wrapped around his and smiling up all excited at him.</p><p>Normally he wouldn\u2019t mess with someone who had a significant other, but there was something about this guy. Maybe it was the pushed up black quiff and thick rimmed glasses. Maybe it was that stupid button up shirt that was decorated in tiny dogs. Dan watched as he lifted his head to the sky and let out the most joyful laugh Dan had ever heard, and that\u2019s when he made up his mind. He wanted to see this guy with his head thrown back, but because of Dan, and what he knew he was good at.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t have to wait in line because he knew all the bouncers in town, thanks to his compulsive weekend habits. He took up post at the bar, just biding his time.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before the man was in view, making his way to the bar. Dan had deliberately kept the seat next to him empty, making it the only available spot for his conquest to come to. Dan watched as he whispered something in the girl\u2019s ear and they split ways - the man coming towards the spot next to Dan and the girl moving toward the tables lining the dance floor. It was like Dan had planned it - which he guessed he sort of did. Guys, especially the ones who looked nice, were easy to predict. No decent guy made his girl stand in line for drinks.</p><p>When he approached the seat and tapped on Dan\u2019s shoulder to see if it was available, Dan gestured for him to take a seat and gave him an inviting smile. His answering blush was just a tick on the list of things that Dan suspected about him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d the bartender asked him, voice loud over the thumping bass.</p><p>\u201cTwo tequila sunrises, please!\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t miss the way the man\u2019s eyes glanced over to him frequently. He didn\u2019t bother hiding his own gaze, though - subtly wasn\u2019t something he knew or understood. If you wanted something, why not just go for it?</p><p>\u201cDo you come here a lot?\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t something that Dan expected. He raised his eyebrows at the man, a surprised smile tugging at his lips.</p><p>\u201cNot especially,\u201d Dan relied. \u201cI\u2019m more of a pub or house party kinda guy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and fiddled with the napkin in his hand. He glanced up at Dan and then back down again before speaking. \u201cWhat brings you in tonight, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>It was the type of thing that could really have two reactions: disgust and an upturned nose. Or - the blush and sharp intake of breath that was happening now.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Dan cocked his head to the side and made no effort to hide the trail of his eyes down his body. It was a nice body - tall, broad shoulders, nice arms and probably a nice ass, given how the sides of his hips flared out.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he chuckled, cheeks still a delicious pink.</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything else as the bartender placed his drinks down on the bar. Dan watched as he picked them up and gave Dan one last lingering look before walking over to the blonde girl and the table she had scored.</p><p>Dan watched as he sat down and they started talking, but looked away after a second. There was surely someone else just as attractive in the club, right? He wasn\u2019t worried that he wouldn\u2019t find anyone. He was just vain enough to know that he was attractive and could pull just about anyone he wanted - one of the few exceptions was sitting across the bar, full pink lips wrapped around a straw.</p><p>Not that Dan was still looking, of course.</p><p>-</p><p>It was probably close to an hour later when Dan spotted him again. Tired of sitting, Dan had walked on to the dance floor and started moving to the music, letting the sting of tequila still burning his throat carry him to the beat. It wasn\u2019t the type of music he usually preferred, but it was loud with a decent rhythm and he could move his hips to it.</p><p>At some point an arm wrapped around his waist - some tall guy whose features weren\u2019t really what Dan usually went for, but he was cute enough that a few more drinks could persuade him into falling into bed with them.</p><p>He spotted the black haired man not long after, the blonde girl nowhere to be seen. He was coming onto the floor, near enough that Dan could see him, and see that he was watching Dan. He was alone, so Dan pulled away from his replacement and moved towards him.</p><p>\u201cWant to dance?\u201d he asked, surprising Dan again.</p><p>Dan nodded and pulled the man towards him, their hips close enough that Dan could feel the heat of his body.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked into the shell of Dan\u2019s ear, making an involuntary shiver run down his spine.</p><p>\u201cDan.\u201d</p><p>He smirked a little, eyes crinkling in the corners. \u201cI\u2019m Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Phil.\u201d Dan didn\u2019t bother with any more words, just pulled him even closer and let the beat carry them for a while.</p><p>-</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for them to move from dancing to just pressing up against each other and grinding, to pushing Phil up against the wall and kissing him like their lives depended on it. He tasted like tequila and cherry, courtesy of his drink from earlier, and Dan lapped it up.</p><p>In a bolder move than Dan would have expected from this sweet, but meek, boy in front of him, Phil\u2019s hand slipped down between their bodies, moving to the front and cupping Dan\u2019s growing erection. The air in his lungs was punched out of him and he thrusted his hips forward, instantly wanting more of what Phil was giving him.</p><p>He pulled back, taking in the color high on Phil\u2019s cheeks and the way his lips were shiny and puffy from kissing, and he made a gut decision, pulling him into the closest place with a door to it.</p><p>-</p><p>And now here they were: Dan on his knees and Phil above him, head thrown back just as Dan had pictured, and it was even better than he could have imagined. He wasn\u2019t vocal, but that didn\u2019t stop little grunts and whimpers leaving him as Dan took him deeper and deeper.</p><p>At some point, Phil\u2019s hands had threaded through Dan\u2019s sweaty locks, probably just for purchase, but as Dan swirled his tongue around the head of Phil\u2019s leaking cock, he had pulled hard enough that a twinge of pain traveled through Dan, along with a rush of pleasure. He was already painfully hard and that did nothing to help.</p><p>\u201cFuck, sorry,\u201d Phil panted above him, and Dan pulled his mouth away just long enough to tell him it was fine, that he liked it, and resumed his work.</p><p>That seemed to be all the encouragement he needed because after that, he gripped and pulled and Dan was in heaven.

He didn&rsquo;t really do the whole &lsquo;going home with someone&rsquo; thing, but there was something about Phil, even though he knew that was one hell of a clich&eacute;.</p><p>He shrugged. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>The surprise that painted Phil&rsquo;s face was worth going out of his comfort zone. He placed a chaste kiss on Dan&rsquo;s cheek and opened the stall door, pulling Dan towards uncharted territory that he was actually kind of excited to explore.</p>",
