        "body": "<p>Speculations galore! Long post ahoy!</p><p>Let\u2019s run through every possibility I can think of for the end of show-Sansa\u2019s story (and yes, there will be many more possibilities besides these because GOT is layers upon layers, man, I\u2019m still new to the fandom, and there\u2019s probably a lot I\u2019ve missed). </p><p>At the very least, let\u2019s do this <i>categorically</i>. </p><h2>Dead, Alive, or a Fate Worse Than Death?</h2><p>1. I\u2019d bet money that Sansa survives the whole dang thing</p><p>2. But if she does die\u2026it could be A) Sacrifice to save Arya, Jon, and/or Bran, B) in a possible collapse of Winterfell, C) after ensuring the demise of Cersei or a similar threat, D) something worthy of a song </p><p>3. Crack Theory: Sansa Becomes the Night Queen?</p><h2>Shipping&hellip;</h2><!-- more --><p>1. <b>Let\u2019s start with the most popular ship: Jonsa.</b> While I\u2019m not personally a Jonsa fan, I neither hate it nor see it as a complete impossibility. And while I\u2019m not personally a Jonerys fan, I neither hate it nor see it as a no-brainer. Jonsa makes sense practically (uniting Targ and Stark, North &amp; South; they already trust one another; cousin marriage isn\u2019t considered incest in-universe, etc.), though I\u2019m not entirely convinced if the show goes this direction that it would be the most romantic ship ever. The best I see is that it has vibes similar to Ned/Cat when they were first married to one another; they didn\u2019t love each other romantically at first, but it would come with time. As for political!Jon Theory making this ship possible, while I wouldn\u2019t completely put it past the GOT universe to make Jon that cold, it honestly doesn\u2019t jive with what I think is at the core of Jon: which is a hardscrabble sort of nobility, decency, honesty. I mean, if he was politcal!Jon, wouldn\u2019t he have come up with a smoother way to handle Cersei in their first meeting? Anyhoot, the ship isn\u2019t hateful. I think the biggest obstacles are the fact that, even though they are technically cousins, they were raised as brother and sister. You don\u2019t just erase that. This is somewhat \u201cremedied\u201d by the fact that they were never close and Sansa pretty much treated him as a whole-lot-less-than-a-brother for most of their childhood. But GOT has never shown incestuous relationships (again, I don\u2019t really consider historically based cousin relationships as incestuous, but it is a close family bond never-the-less) as a good thing. At all. The Targ\u2019s went mad; Dany\u2019s brother was creepy as fudge; UMM Jaime x Cersei dear Lord; Craster and his Merry Brood, etc. (But this mainly just spells doom for Jonerys, IMHO). So, as with anything in GOT&ndash;it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s also not possible, there\u2019s undertones, but there\u2019s undertones for the complete opposite thing happening, etc. Lastly, as for the \u201cromantic framing\u201d of S7, I think it falls under that same maybe/maybe-not. I LOVE Jon and Sansa\u2019s dynamic, even if I don\u2019t see it as romantic, even if does or does not end up romantic. It is certainly one thing: intimate. And the framing (forehead kiss, bittersweet reunion, worrying for one another\u2019s safety) supports that at the very least. If they don\u2019t end up romantically, Jon is the last real strong male relative that Sansa has. That\u2019s not to diss Bran, but D&amp;D have made him a remote magical old man stuck in a teenager\u2019s body. In some ways, he\u2019s dead to Sansa too (as Meera said, \u201cYou died in that cave.\u201d). The poetry, the irony, is that the people Sansa had the most problems with in her family (Arya and Jon) are all that Sansa has left now (yes, yes, I love Bran, but again he\u2019s acting more like a solo unit than a family unit at this point)&ndash;and she realizes how much they\u2019ve always meant to her. Jon, and Arya for that matter, are different sides of Sansa, just as she is a different side for each of them. The parallels are lovely, and this ship could very well set sail. </p><p>2. <b>My personal favorite: Sanrion (Sansa x Tyrion, Tyrion x Sansa, whatever the preferred parlance is). </b>Yes, I\u2019m biased, so this entry will be the longest&ndash;BUT, let\u2019s remove my shipper goggles. This, to me, is just as possible as Jonsa. That is, I don\u2019t see it as guaranteed at all, but there\u2019s plenty to read from the text. Let\u2019s get the trouble spots out of the way: <b>1)</b> the build-up has been few and far in-between since S4 (though they did throw us a bone in S7). <b>2)</b> the 50/50 chance of Tyrion dying in S8 (no, I\u2019m not basing this on \u201cleaks,\u201d interviews, or what-not&ndash;I\u2019m just using this as a baseline guess, given that this is GOT and given that Tyrion is at the center of a very dangerous web of relationships), <b>3) </b>the show possibly not wanting to ask a twentysomething actress and a nearly 50-year-old actor to act out anything deliberately romantic (however, I don\u2019t expect an on-screen ship to be anything but unconventionally romantic&ndash;I very much see it being done with subtle dialogue, color theory, ambiguous looks, an epilogue, etc), and <b>4)</b> Tyrion may or may not be in love with Daenerys. None of these trouble spots spells doom for me. The greatest \u201cdoom\u201d is simply Sansa ending up alone (thematically possible) or with someone else (also thematically possible). Let\u2019s break down counter-points to the trouble spots, then I\u2019ll list my reasons why this ship could sail. <b>1) </b>Almost all relationships in GOT are troubled and/or unconventional, built up over one season, hidden underneath layers of symbolism, or suffer from the fact that one or both partners are either dead or seperated (by this same token, Sansa\u2019s other popular ships, Jonsa and Sansan, also suffer the same dearth of \u201cdevelopment\u201d or copious screen time. Arguably, Jonsa\u2019s foundations were mostly built over the later seasons), <b>2)</b> yeah, Tyrion could die (and I would be heartbroken but not blindsided) or Tyrion could live (but I would bet money that Sansa lives through the whole thing), <b>3)</b> the show already put them through the most awkward phase of their \u201crelationship\u201d (i.e., their wedding night, though it was toned down compared to the books) and they can still sell this relationship in any number of ways (again, dialogue, color theory, looks, just holding hands again geez Louise), <b>4)</b> Tyrion\u2019s \u201clove\u201d for Daenerys is incredibly debatable and may only be used as fuel for a soap opera plot that I really hope doesn\u2019t happen, but even the director of the S7 finale said Tyrion\u2019s main concern was political and Dinklage proposed the idea that Tyrion only \u201cthink he\u2019s in love\u201d with Dany, that what most people feel for Dany is awe (I\u2019m neither a Dany fan or hater, but it\u2019s hard to deny that she\u2019s shocking, enthralling, powerful, attractive, a force, for lack of a better term). Now, on to the practical/thematical reasons why I think this ship would work. Let\u2019s use letters for this, haha. <b>A)</b> Fairy Tale parallels/Turning Tropes Upside Down: It\u2019s easy to read inversions of fairy tale archetypes into Sansa\u2019s storyline, as that is what her character is naturally drawn to: songs, princesses, true love, beauty. So far in the story she has learned that looks can be deceiving; life is not a song (though I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if GRRM turns this on its head again, and Sansa simply learns that all great tales involve sorrow and darkness as well as joy and light&ndash;i.e., bittersweet vs. simply sweet); people are not black and white (Tyrion shows her that the Lannisters aren\u2019t necessarily all evil and Littlefinger shows her that allies, even someone who loved her mother, are not necessarily all good); etc. Just some of the fairy tales/tropes that play into Sansa\u2019s personal storyline and the subtext of Sansa x Tyrion include: Beauty and the Beast, Psyche and Cupid, Hades and Persephone, The Princess in the Tower archetype, and many, many more (I\u2019ll meta about it one of these days&ndash;and there are already many excellent posts under the Sansa tag that expound on these). <b>B)</b> The Queen Elizabeth Theory: So Sansa has parallels with two remarkable historical Queen Elizabeths: Elizabeth of York and Queen Elizabeth I. \u00a0Since this has been said by so many before, here\u2019s a quote and link to the article as summary: \u201cThe show is based off the War of the Roses, the real-life family feud between the Lancasters and Yorks that ended with the two broods combining their houses. Since the storyline happening at the end of season seven is extremely similar to this moment in history, we can infer that GoT will follow that path&hellip;\u201d <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/game-of-thrones-theory-sansa-tyrion-destined-to-rule?verso=true\">Link</a> \u00a0<b>C)</b> Character Actions Written Especially For the Show: Just to name a few: GRRM purposely changed a moment in the books to where Sansa hands Tyrion a cup instead of him having to crawl underneath a table to do so; Tyrion remains loyal to his wedding vows (and this is probably inspired by his trauma for having killed his father and lover as well) even when it was very possible that Sansa had left him high-and-dry and the marriage was, in Tyrion\u2019s own words, a \u201csham marriage\u201d; Sansa and Tyrion both stick up for one another\u2019s character, etc., and <b>D)</b> Also, aren\u2019t they technically married? :-p <i>[There\u2019s a lot more, but again, I\u2019ll save that for a future meta]</i></p><p><b>3. Sansan:</b> While there may end up being a slight possibility in the books, I don\u2019t think show-Sansa and show-Sandor are heading in this direction. However, the same fairytale motifs play into play here: Beauty and the Beast, Hades and Persephone, etc. Also, bridge4 over on Youtube has a fabulous analysis of the \u201cunKiss\u201d over on his channel, which I think could pop up in some shape or form in S8. Here\u2019s the\u00a0\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9jO87LXoGk\">link</a></b>\n\n</p><p>4. <b>Sansa Alone:</b> Also supports the Queen Elizabeth theory. Specifically, Elizabeth I \u201cthe Virgin Queen.\u201d This would a different form of poetry/irony: Sansa, the one who wanted most to be a queen consort and be married to a handsome king and have babies, ends up as a queen (full-stop) but leverages her power as a single lady. Not my favorite ending for Sansa, as I\u2019m Teh Unabashed Romantic, but it\u2019s plausible, thematic, pragmatic. Only time will tell!</p><h2>The Fate of the North, Night King, Direwolf Theorizing</h2><p>Just spitballing various takes:</p><p>1. The war is \u201cwon\u201d (as in mankind survives), but Winterfell or possibly the entire North is compromised. As in, perhaps they have to trade the North to the Winter King at the promise he won\u2019t invade the rest of Westeros. Or Winterfell explodes, so the North and all of Westeros is saved but the Starks lose their home</p><p>2. The Starks deliberately blow up Winterfell, for any number of reasons. Perhaps a bunch of wights or what-nots ended up there. Perhaps the dead in the Crypts were resurrected, and this was the only way to neutralize that threat. Or something deeper and darker lurks in the Crypts, something worse than the Night King. In fact\u2026.</p><p>3. Maybe the true enemy ends up being something awoken within the Crypts of Winterfell, and the Night King is not what he seems\u2026.</p><p>4. The old gods play an unexpected role</p><p>5. The godswood is burned or ends up in splinters or is used to create a new throne (ending the age of iron, fire, blood and making this a \u201ctime for wolves\u201d)</p><p>6. Sansa\u2019s direwolf Lady is resurrected (of course, poor Lady is headless\u2026) and manages to wound Cersei (if she gets her arse up north, which seems unlikely) before Cersei\u2019s killed by whoever the heck the Valonquar is</p><p>7. Speaking of, could Ghost be the Valonquar? I mean, he was the runt, the littlest brother of the brood. Eh, dunno. I just don\u2019t expect the Valonquar to be anything close to what we think he/she/it/them is. </p><p>8. I like the idea of parts of the ocean being permanently frozen over because of something the Night King does. Dunno why. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any foreshadowing to that in the show; it just sounds cool, and represents a permanent consequence to the land. Because I do not expect there to be zero consequence for the landscape of Westeros itself. The Greyjoy\u2019s are already kinda sorta doomed (with eunuch Theon being the last male of that line, unless Euron\u2019s got a kid somewhere and he ends up surviving to take the throne and not be a dick about it), so it\u2019d be a bit of tragic poetry if their islands, their seas were frozen and lifeless but thanks to their efforts the rest of Westeros is safe and their people will have to make a life on land</p><p>9. One or both remaining dragons are frozen for all timez</p><p>10. Sansa becomes Queen in the North or Queen of the Seven Kingdoms (is there really an in-between?)</p><h2>Bonus</h2><p>Lastly, here\u2019s just an observation on an important part of Sansa\u2019s storyline and character development: Arya Stark. I believe Sansa and Arya adopted different pieces of the original storylines in GRRM\u2019s book proposal outline&ndash;not that I put much stock in the outline. Sansa was created, at first, to add tension to the Stark family. GRRM says he was surprised by Sansa\u2019s developments; he also says he empathizes with whichever character he is currently writing, so I think he just naturally found things that he liked in Sansa that made her more than a complication device. Because his original vision included Arya as the sole Stark daughter, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sansa and Arya aren\u2019t the result of this once singular character being developed into two very different ways. The archetypal Amazon Wild Child and the Princess in the Tower. Two sides of the same coin&ndash;or, in Ned\u2019s words, Sansa is the sun to Arya\u2019s moon and vice-versa. For this reason, I don\u2019t put it past Sansa to continue developing her personal brand of Brave Northern Lady and Arya developing her personal brand of Brave Northern Lady. Because that is what they both are: brave, northern, ladies. Will Sansa find herself at the center of a love triangle? I really, really hope not, but at this point if it is gonna happen I find it much more likely with Sansa than with Arya. </p>",

Crack Theory: Sansa Becomes the Night Queen?</p><h2>Shipping\u2026</h2>[[MORE]]<p>1. <b>Let\u2019s start with the most popular ship: Jonsa.</b> While I\u2019m not personally a Jonsa fan, I neither hate it nor see it as a complete impossibility. And while I\u2019m not personally a Jonerys fan, I neither hate it nor see it as a no-brainer. Jonsa makes sense practically (uniting Targ and Stark, North &amp; South; they already trust one another; cousin marriage isn\u2019t considered incest in-universe, etc.), though I\u2019m not entirely convinced if the show goes this direction that it would be the most romantic ship ever. The best I see is that it has vibes similar to Ned/Cat when they were first married to one another; they didn\u2019t love each other romantically at first, but it would come with time. As for political!Jon Theory making this ship possible, while I wouldn\u2019t completely put it past the GOT universe to make Jon that cold, it honestly doesn\u2019t jive with what I think is at the core of Jon: which is a hardscrabble sort of nobility, decency, honesty. I mean, if he was politcal!Jon, wouldn\u2019t he have come up with a smoother way to handle Cersei in their first meeting? Anyhoot, the ship isn\u2019t hateful. I think the biggest obstacles are the fact that, even though they are technically cousins, they were raised as brother and sister. You don\u2019t just erase that. This is somewhat \u201cremedied\u201d by the fact that they were never close and Sansa pretty much treated him as a whole-lot-less-than-a-brother for most of their childhood. But GOT has never shown incestuous relationships (again, I don\u2019t really consider historically based cousin relationships as incestuous, but it is a close family bond never-the-less) as a good thing. At all. The Targ\u2019s went mad; Dany\u2019s brother was creepy as fudge; UMM Jaime x Cersei dear Lord; Craster and his Merry Brood, etc. (But this mainly just spells doom for Jonerys, IMHO). So, as with anything in GOT\u2013it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s also not possible, there\u2019s undertones, but there\u2019s undertones for the complete opposite thing happening, etc. Lastly, as for the \u201cromantic framing\u201d of S7, I think it falls under that same maybe/maybe-not. I LOVE Jon and Sansa\u2019s dynamic, even if I don\u2019t see it as romantic, even if does or does not end up romantic. It is certainly one thing: intimate. And the framing (forehead kiss, bittersweet reunion, worrying for one another\u2019s safety) supports that at the very least. If they don\u2019t end up romantically, Jon is the last real strong male relative that Sansa has. That\u2019s not to diss Bran, but D&amp;D have made him a remote magical old man stuck in a teenager\u2019s body. In some ways, he\u2019s dead to Sansa too (as Meera said, \u201cYou died in that cave.\u201d). The poetry, the irony, is that the people Sansa had the most problems with in her family (Arya and Jon) are all that Sansa has left now (yes, yes, I love Bran, but again he\u2019s acting more like a solo unit than a family unit at this point)\u2013and she realizes how much they\u2019ve always meant to her. Jon, and Arya for that matter, are different sides of Sansa, just as she is a different side for each of them. The parallels are lovely, and this ship could very well set sail. </p><p>2. <b>My personal favorite: Sanrion (Sansa x Tyrion, Tyrion x Sansa, whatever the preferred parlance is). </b>Yes, I\u2019m biased, so this entry will be the longest\u2013BUT, let\u2019s remove my shipper goggles. This, to me, is just as possible as Jonsa. That is, I don\u2019t see it as guaranteed at all, but there\u2019s plenty to read from the text. Let\u2019s get the trouble spots out of the way: <b>1)</b> the build-up has been few and far in-between since S4 (though they did throw us a bone in S7). <b>2)</b> the 50/50 chance of Tyrion dying in S8 (no, I\u2019m not basing this on \u201cleaks,\u201d interviews, or what-not\u2013I\u2019m just using this as a baseline guess, given that this is GOT and given that Tyrion is at the center of a very dangerous web of relationships), <b>3) </b>the show possibly not wanting to ask a twentysomething actress and a nearly 50-year-old actor to act out anything deliberately romantic (however, I don\u2019t expect an on-screen ship to be anything but unconventionally romantic\u2013I very much see it being done with subtle dialogue, color theory, ambiguous looks, an epilogue, etc), and <b>4)</b> Tyrion may or may not be in love with Daenerys. None of these trouble spots spells doom for me. The greatest \u201cdoom\u201d is simply Sansa ending up alone (thematically possible) or with someone else (also thematically possible). Let\u2019s break down counter-points to the trouble spots, then I\u2019ll list my reasons why this ship could sail. <b>1) </b>Almost all relationships in GOT are troubled and/or unconventional, built up over one season, hidden underneath layers of symbolism, or suffer from the fact that one or both partners are either dead or seperated (by this same token, Sansa\u2019s other popular ships, Jonsa and Sansan, also suffer the same dearth of \u201cdevelopment\u201d or copious screen time. Arguably, Jonsa\u2019s foundations were mostly built over the later seasons), <b>2)</b> yeah, Tyrion could die (and I would be heartbroken but not blindsided) or Tyrion could live (but I would bet money that Sansa lives through the whole thing), <b>3)</b> the show already put them through the most awkward phase of their \u201crelationship\u201d (i.e., their wedding night, though it was toned down compared to the books) and they can still sell this relationship in any number of ways (again, dialogue, color theory, looks, just holding hands again geez Louise), <b>4)</b> Tyrion\u2019s \u201clove\u201d for Daenerys is incredibly debatable and may only be used as fuel for a soap opera plot that I really hope doesn\u2019t happen, but even the director of the S7 finale said Tyrion\u2019s main concern was political and Dinklage proposed the idea that Tyrion only \u201cthink he\u2019s in love\u201d with Dany, that what most people feel for Dany is awe (I\u2019m neither a Dany fan or hater, but it\u2019s hard to deny that she\u2019s shocking, enthralling, powerful, attractive, a force, for lack of a better term). Now, on to the practical/thematical reasons why I think this ship would work. Let\u2019s use letters for this, haha. <b>A)</b> Fairy Tale parallels/Turning Tropes Upside Down: It\u2019s easy to read inversions of fairy tale archetypes into Sansa\u2019s storyline, as that is what her character is naturally drawn to: songs, princesses, true love, beauty.

I\u2019d bet money that Sansa survives the whole dang thing</p><p>2. But if she does die\u2026it could be A) Sacrifice to save Arya, Jon, and/or Bran, B) in a possible collapse of Winterfell, C) after ensuring the demise of Cersei or a similar threat, D) something worthy of a song </p><p>3. Crack Theory: Sansa Becomes the Night Queen?</p><h2>Shipping\u2026</h2>[[MORE]]<p>1. <b>Let\u2019s start with the most popular ship: Jonsa.</b> While I\u2019m not personally a Jonsa fan, I neither hate it nor see it as a complete impossibility. And while I\u2019m not personally a Jonerys fan, I neither hate it nor see it as a no-brainer. Jonsa makes sense practically (uniting Targ and Stark, North &amp; South; they already trust one another; cousin marriage isn\u2019t considered incest in-universe, etc.), though I\u2019m not entirely convinced if the show goes this direction that it would be the most romantic ship ever. The best I see is that it has vibes similar to Ned/Cat when they were first married to one another; they didn\u2019t love each other romantically at first, but it would come with time. As for political!Jon Theory making this ship possible, while I wouldn\u2019t completely put it past the GOT universe to make Jon that cold, it honestly doesn\u2019t jive with what I think is at the core of Jon: which is a hardscrabble sort of nobility, decency, honesty. I mean, if he was politcal!Jon, wouldn\u2019t he have come up with a smoother way to handle Cersei in their first meeting? Anyhoot, the ship isn\u2019t hateful. I think the biggest obstacles are the fact that, even though they are technically cousins, they were raised as brother and sister. You don\u2019t just erase that. This is somewhat \u201cremedied\u201d by the fact that they were never close and Sansa pretty much treated him as a whole-lot-less-than-a-brother for most of their childhood. But GOT has never shown incestuous relationships (again, I don\u2019t really consider historically based cousin relationships as incestuous, but it is a close family bond never-the-less) as a good thing. At all. The Targ\u2019s went mad; Dany\u2019s brother was creepy as fudge; UMM Jaime x Cersei dear Lord; Craster and his Merry Brood, etc. (But this mainly just spells doom for Jonerys, IMHO). So, as with anything in GOT\u2013it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s also not possible, there\u2019s undertones, but there\u2019s undertones for the complete opposite thing happening, etc. Lastly, as for the \u201cromantic framing\u201d of S7, I think it falls under that same maybe/maybe-not. I LOVE Jon and Sansa\u2019s dynamic, even if I don\u2019t see it as romantic, even if does or does not end up romantic. It is certainly one thing: intimate. And the framing (forehead kiss, bittersweet reunion, worrying for one another\u2019s safety) supports that at the very least. If they don\u2019t end up romantically, Jon is the last real strong male relative that Sansa has. That\u2019s not to diss Bran, but D&amp;D have made him a remote magical old man stuck in a teenager\u2019s body. In some ways, he\u2019s dead to Sansa too (as Meera said, \u201cYou died in that cave.\u201d). The poetry, the irony, is that the people Sansa had the most problems with in her family (Arya and Jon) are all that Sansa has left now (yes, yes, I love Bran, but again he\u2019s acting more like a solo unit than a family unit at this point)\u2013and she realizes how much they\u2019ve always meant to her. Jon, and Arya for that matter, are different sides of Sansa, just as she is a different side for each of them. The parallels are lovely, and this ship could very well set sail. </p><p>2. <b>My personal favorite: Sanrion (Sansa x Tyrion, Tyrion x Sansa, whatever the preferred parlance is). </b>Yes, I\u2019m biased, so this entry will be the longest\u2013BUT, let\u2019s remove my shipper goggles. This, to me, is just as possible as Jonsa. That is, I don\u2019t see it as guaranteed at all, but there\u2019s plenty to read from the text. Let\u2019s get the trouble spots out of the way: <b>1)</b> the build-up has been few and far in-between since S4 (though they did throw us a bone in S7). <b>2)</b> the 50/50 chance of Tyrion dying in S8 (no, I\u2019m not basing this on \u201cleaks,\u201d interviews, or what-not\u2013I\u2019m just using this as a baseline guess, given that this is GOT and given that Tyrion is at the center of a very dangerous web of relationships), <b>3) </b>the show possibly not wanting to ask a twentysomething actress and a nearly 50-year-old actor to act out anything deliberately romantic (however, I don\u2019t expect an on-screen ship to be anything but unconventionally romantic\u2013I very much see it being done with subtle dialogue, color theory, ambiguous looks, an epilogue, etc), and <b>4)</b> Tyrion may or may not be in love with Daenerys. None of these trouble spots spells doom for me. The greatest \u201cdoom\u201d is simply Sansa ending up alone (thematically possible) or with someone else (also thematically possible). Let\u2019s break down counter-points to the trouble spots, then I\u2019ll list my reasons why this ship could sail. <b>1) </b>Almost all relationships in GOT are troubled and/or unconventional, built up over one season, hidden underneath layers of symbolism, or suffer from the fact that one or both partners are either dead or seperated (by this same token, Sansa\u2019s other popular ships, Jonsa and Sansan, also suffer the same dearth of \u201cdevelopment\u201d or copious screen time. Arguably, Jonsa\u2019s foundations were mostly built over the later seasons), <b>2)</b> yeah, Tyrion could die (and I would be heartbroken but not blindsided) or Tyrion could live (but I would bet money that Sansa lives through the whole thing), <b>3)</b> the show already put them through the most awkward phase of their \u201crelationship\u201d (i.e., their wedding night, though it was toned down compared to the books) and they can still sell this relationship in any number of ways (again, dialogue, color theory, looks, just holding hands again geez Louise), <b>4)</b> Tyrion\u2019s \u201clove\u201d for Daenerys is incredibly debatable and may only be used as fuel for a soap opera plot that I really hope doesn\u2019t happen, but even the director of the S7 finale said Tyrion\u2019s main concern was political and Dinklage proposed the idea that Tyrion only \u201cthink he\u2019s in love\u201d with Dany, that what most people feel for Dany is awe (I\u2019m neither a Dany fan or hater, but it\u2019s hard to deny that she\u2019s shocking, enthralling, powerful, attractive, a force, for lack of a better term). Now, on to the practical/thematical reasons why I think this ship would work. Let\u2019s use letters for this, haha. <b>A)</b> Fairy Tale parallels/Turning Tropes Upside Down: It\u2019s easy to read inversions of fairy tale archetypes into Sansa\u2019s storyline, as that is what her character is naturally drawn to: songs, princesses, true love, beauty. So far in the story she has learned that looks can be deceiving; life is not a song (though I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if GRRM turns this on its head again, and Sansa simply learns that all great tales involve sorrow and darkness as well as joy and light\u2013i.e., bittersweet vs. simply sweet); people are not black and white (Tyrion shows her that the Lannisters aren\u2019t necessarily all evil and Littlefinger shows her that allies, even someone who loved her mother, are not necessarily all good); etc. Just some of the fairy tales/tropes that play into Sansa\u2019s personal storyline and the subtext of Sansa x Tyrion include: Beauty and the Beast, Psyche and Cupid, Hades and Persephone, The Princess in the Tower archetype, and many, many more (I\u2019ll meta about it one of these days\u2013and there are already many excellent posts under the Sansa tag that expound on these). <b>B)</b> The Queen Elizabeth Theory: So Sansa has parallels with two remarkable historical Queen Elizabeths: Elizabeth of York and Queen Elizabeth I. \u00a0Since this has been said by so many before, here\u2019s a quote and link to the article as summary: \u201cThe show is based off the War of the Roses, the real-life family feud between the Lancasters and Yorks that ended with the two broods combining their houses. Since the storyline happening at the end of season seven is extremely similar to this moment in history, we can infer that GoT will follow that path\u2026\u201d <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/game-of-thrones-theory-sansa-tyrion-destined-to-rule?verso=true\">Link</a> \u00a0<b>C)</b> Character Actions Written Especially For the Show: Just to name a few: GRRM purposely changed a moment in the books to where Sansa hands Tyrion a cup instead of him having to crawl underneath a table to do so; Tyrion remains loyal to his wedding vows (and this is probably inspired by his trauma for having killed his father and lover as well) even when it was very possible that Sansa had left him high-and-dry and the marriage was, in Tyrion\u2019s own words, a \u201csham marriage\u201d; Sansa and Tyrion both stick up for one another\u2019s character, etc., and <b>D)</b> Also, aren\u2019t they technically married? :-p <i>[There\u2019s a lot more, but again, I\u2019ll save that for a future meta]</i></p><p><b>3. Sansan:</b> While there may end up being a slight possibility in the books, I don\u2019t think show-Sansa and show-Sandor are heading in this direction. However, the same fairytale motifs play into play here: Beauty and the Beast, Hades and Persephone, etc. Also, bridge4 over on Youtube has a fabulous analysis of the \u201cunKiss\u201d over on his channel, which I think could pop up in some shape or form in S8. Here\u2019s the\u00a0\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9jO87LXoGk\">link</a></b>\n\n</p><p>4. <b>Sansa Alone:</b> Also supports the Queen Elizabeth theory. Specifically, Elizabeth I \u201cthe Virgin Queen.\u201d This would a different form of poetry/irony: Sansa, the one who wanted most to be a queen consort and be married to a handsome king and have babies, ends up as a queen (full-stop) but leverages her power as a single lady. Not my favorite ending for Sansa, as I\u2019m Teh Unabashed Romantic, but it\u2019s plausible, thematic, pragmatic. Only time will tell!</p><h2>The Fate of the North, Night King, Direwolf Theorizing</h2><p>Just spitballing various takes:</p><p>1. The war is \u201cwon\u201d (as in mankind survives), but Winterfell or possibly the entire North is compromised. As in, perhaps they have to trade the North to the Winter King at the promise he won\u2019t invade the rest of Westeros. Or Winterfell explodes, so the North and all of Westeros is saved but the Starks lose their home</p><p>2. The Starks deliberately blow up Winterfell, for any number of reasons. Perhaps a bunch of wights or what-nots ended up there. Perhaps the dead in the Crypts were resurrected, and this was the only way to neutralize that threat. Or something deeper and darker lurks in the Crypts, something worse than the Night King. In fact\u2026.</p><p>3. Maybe the true enemy ends up being something awoken within the Crypts of Winterfell, and the Night King is not what he seems\u2026.</p><p>4. The old gods play an unexpected role</p><p>5. The godswood is burned or ends up in splinters or is used to create a new throne (ending the age of iron, fire, blood and making this a \u201ctime for wolves\u201d)</p><p>6. Sansa\u2019s direwolf Lady is resurrected (of course, poor Lady is headless\u2026) and manages to wound Cersei (if she gets her arse up north, which seems unlikely) before Cersei\u2019s killed by whoever the heck the Valonquar is</p><p>7. Speaking of, could Ghost be the Valonquar? I mean, he was the runt, the littlest brother of the brood. Eh, dunno. I just don\u2019t expect the Valonquar to be anything close to what we think he/she/it/them is. </p><p>8. I like the idea of parts of the ocean being permanently frozen over because of something the Night King does. Dunno why. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any foreshadowing to that in the show; it just sounds cool, and represents a permanent consequence to the land. Because I do not expect there to be zero consequence for the landscape of Westeros itself. The Greyjoy\u2019s are already kinda sorta doomed (with eunuch Theon being the last male of that line, unless Euron\u2019s got a kid somewhere and he ends up surviving to take the throne and not be a dick about it), so it\u2019d be a bit of tragic poetry if their islands, their seas were frozen and lifeless but thanks to their efforts the rest of Westeros is safe and their people will have to make a life on land</p><p>9. One or both remaining dragons are frozen for all timez</p><p>10. Sansa becomes Queen in the North or Queen of the Seven Kingdoms (is there really an in-between?)</p><h2>Bonus</h2><p>Lastly, here\u2019s just an observation on an important part of Sansa\u2019s storyline and character development: Arya Stark. I believe Sansa and Arya adopted different pieces of the original storylines in GRRM\u2019s book proposal outline\u2013not that I put much stock in the outline. Sansa was created, at first, to add tension to the Stark family. GRRM says he was surprised by Sansa\u2019s developments; he also says he empathizes with whichever character he is currently writing, so I think he just naturally found things that he liked in Sansa that made her more than a complication device. Because his original vision included Arya as the sole Stark daughter, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sansa and Arya aren\u2019t the result of this once singular character being developed into two very different ways. The archetypal Amazon Wild Child and the Princess in the Tower. Two sides of the same coin\u2013or, in Ned\u2019s words, Sansa is the sun to Arya\u2019s moon and vice-versa. For this reason, I don\u2019t put it past Sansa to continue developing her personal brand of Brave Northern Lady and Arya developing her personal brand of Brave Northern Lady. Because that is what they both are: brave, northern, ladies. Will Sansa find herself at the center of a love triangle? I really, really hope not, but at this point if it is gonna happen I find it much more likely with Sansa than with Arya. </p>",

The archetypal Amazon Wild Child and the Princess in the Tower. Two sides of the same coin&ndash;or, in Ned&rsquo;s words, Sansa is the sun to Arya&rsquo;s moon and vice-versa. For this reason, I don&rsquo;t put it past Sansa to continue developing her personal brand of Brave Northern Lady and Arya developing her personal brand of Brave Northern Lady. Because that is what they both are: brave, northern, ladies. Will Sansa find herself at the center of a love triangle? I really, really hope not, but at this point if it is gonna happen I find it much more likely with Sansa than with Arya. </p>",
