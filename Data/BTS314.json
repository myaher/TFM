Jungkook had spent over an our whining to you over the phone, insisting that you come over to watch the basketball match and you went anyway, despite the fact that you didn\u2019t know much about basketball and the volume of coursework pilling up.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he whispered in your ear once you were close enough. The way his breath fanned your face tickled your ear causing you to emit a length of giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you giggling about?\u201d Taehyung asked curiously across the room as he eyed the both of you. Knowing him, he wanted in on the fun the both of you were having.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Jungkook replied defensively with a smirk on his face, unwilling to spill. Taehyung\u2019s gaze travelled from his younger member to you, expecting an answer but was met with disappointment as Jungkook\u2019s hand covered your mouth.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u00a0take it off or I\u2019ll lick it,\u201d you threatened but you were only met with a firm no from the boy, his eyes gleaming with mischief. Knowing exactly where to target, your hands reached over to poke his sides making him swallow his laughter and squirm in his seat.</p><p>\u201cGet a room.\u201d It usually had to be a special occasion when Yoongi\u2019s voice would make an appearance as he was always drowned out by the louder members but at times like these he always threw the snarkiest comments.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr just get together already,\u201d Namjoon threw into the wind causing the both of you to stop in your tracks immediately. Like two well punished kindergarten kids, the both of you remained unbelievably quiet the rest of the game. Despite the small pokes you would get from Jungkook time to time, you remained focus on the game and ignored him completely.</p><p>You had met the boy a year ago at a friend\u2019s house warming party. It was a small occasion with a few old and new friends. Jungkook was introduced to you there as Bangtan Sonyeondan\u2019s golden maknae. To you, BTS wasn\u2019t exactly unheard of.\u00a0His name had always came up in passing between the giggles of schoolgirls and even subway advertisements. You weren\u2019t exactly their biggest fan nor did you hate their music which made you quite neutral to the idea of meeting him. Your image of a stuck up arrogant boy, as you imagined most celebrities would be, was immediately shot down when you first met him and the both of you\u00a0hit it off right from the start. Maybe it was because of the small age difference but it seemed that the both of you spoke in this weird wavelength that no one else could comprehend and you enjoyed it. You liked how you finally found someone who seemed to understand you.</p><p>In that one year, you grew closer to him. In between movie nights and take away Fridays, you met the rest of the boys during one of their dance practice and they seemed to liked you, constantly asking you when you\u2019d come over. In that one year, you witnessed Jungkook\u2019s passion for music grow as you watched him perform on the stage. He didn\u2019t even had to get you tickets, you had bought them yourself to surprise him, along with a banner that said you were his number one fan.\u00a0</p><p>And in that one year, you also started to slowly fall for him. To you it didn\u2019t make sense. You couldn\u2019t comprehend how\u00a0one day he was just your friend and then the next you suddenly found it hard to breathe when he would come a little closer than he usually would.</p><p>And you knew he liked you too. The signs were obvious, from the way he would text you to ask you if you got home safely to the way he easily gets flustered when the other members tease him about you. You adored the way he would stumble across his words when his cheeks flushed with colour. But the both of you weren\u2019t exactly dating.\u00a0</p><p>Skinny love, the other boys always remind you.</p><p>It was around three months ago when you were alone in the dorm\u2019s kitchen with Seokjin and you confided in him. Jungkook was out of sight, taking a shower after a long day of practice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that you don\u2019t know whether he likes you, it\u2019s so obvious, so why aren\u2019t the both of you together?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you reasoned,\u00a0\u201che should be the one asking me to be his girlfriend, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you confess instead?\u201d His question left you dumbfounded at the idea and as appealing as it sounded, your numerous attempts were met with great failure.</p><p>You had once wrote your confession in black ink on a full Coca-Cola bottle. With jittery nerves and shaky hands, you gave it to Jungkook asking him to drink it hoping he would see it when he finishes. However before he did, a thirsty Jimin snatched it away and threw it in the bin after he was done.\u00a0</p><p>Another time, you had wrote him a letter of confession for him to bring on tour only to find the day after he left that you gave him the wrong piece of paper, one with your history notes instead.\u00a0</p><p>You also had tried the subtle signs, like leaving your hand on the armrest in a movie theatre or giving him a peck on his cheek before he left for tour but he always took it as a friendly signs instead of something more. And suddenly cheeks kisses and hand holding were a norm in your friendship which flustered you greatly all the time.</p><p>You had tried the more obvious ways too, like asking him to go on a pizza date once but Taehyung\u2019s voice was too loud in the background that he had missed the word\u00a0\u2018date\u2019 and you were too embarrassed to repeat yourself.</p><p>So you had given up, you had decided to just wait for him to confess instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you mad at me?\u201d Jungkook whispered in your ear just as the game was about to end.\u00a0You weren\u2019t exactly mad, you were just kinda annoyed at the fact that the boys had so obviously put it out there but Jungkook being Jungkook still didn\u2019t get the hint. It wasn\u2019t the first time and it surely wouldn\u2019t be the last either.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You replied quite loudly catching the attention of the other boys in the room but Jungkook didn\u2019t buy it. He knew you well enough to tell that your body expression said otherwise. In normal circumstances, if he ever poked you, you would have poked him right back causing a huge\u00a0\u2018fight\u2019 but this time you just weren\u2019t quite in the mood.</p><p>\u201cJust go talk it out in the room,\u201d Seokjin pleaded. As he was the one you usually confided in, he understood how you felt,\u00a0\u201cand don\u2019t come out until you\u2019re done.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, he was met with resistance and stubbornness from the both of you but he didn\u2019t give up. He ended up dragging you into Jungkook\u2019s room as Jungkook followed closely behind like a lost puppy.</p><p>\u201cJust tell him,\u201d he told you as he closed the door shut and walked back to the living room to watch the game.</p><p>The atmosphere in the room was tense and awkward, more than it has ever been with Jungkook. With him, it was always banter and laughter, joy and happiness. This was something new and the tension made your legs weak. You sat down at the edge of his bed and attempted to steady your mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What does hyung know that I don\u2019t?\u201d Jungkook asked as he walked over to you and stared down into your eyes. His eyes held a certain type of softness and it made you weak for him, just like the first day you met him.\u00a0</p><p>You looked back at him, uncertain of how to answer, unsure of how to react without actually confessing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He whined with a pout on his lips.Usually his aegyo didn\u2019t work on you but it did this time and you blamed his pout for what happened next.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t for his pout, you wouldn\u2019t have looked at his lips. If you didn\u2019t look at his lips, you wouldn\u2019t have wondered what it feels like to kiss him and if you didn\u2019t wonder, you wouldn\u2019t have said what you were going to say next.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m going to do something stupid.\u201d You said as you stood up, your eyes merely reaching the tips of his lips. Before he could even respond, you closed your eyes, stood on your tiptoes and touched your lips against his, softly and hesitantly, before pulling away. His lips tasted sugary, like the soda you gave him earlier and it was addictive. Your insides were shaking with fear. You had expected him to push you away. Your hands were trembling with nerves. What had you just done? But the thought that haunted you the most was that you wanted to pull him back in for another.\u00a0</p><p>When you opened your eyes, you were met with a blank look on Jungkook\u2019s face. The only indication that he understood what happened was the colour of his cheeks flushing red. It took a moment for him to process what had just happened before a smile crept onto his lips.</p><p>\u201cDo that again.\u201d He whispered in a hoarse voice.</p><p>He took one step closer towards you and you took a step back, making you fall onto the bed. His arms wrapped around you as you fell, attempting to soften the blow but he ended up crushing you instead.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d You said in between laughter as you rubbed the part of your rib his arm jabbed into. Everything felt clumsy and you liked it because it made everything else feel so insanely real. You liked how the first kiss wasn\u2019t perfect.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He crashed his soft lips onto yours again and you wondered if you would ever forget how they taste like. You hoped that you never do.\u00a0His hands were tangled in your hair in an attempt you pull you closer as yours roamed his chiseled back.\u00a0</p><p>This was finally it. You were kissing him. The months of waiting and wondering showed in the way he touched you. Everything felt more urgent from the pressure on your lips to the way his hands moved but there was still gentleness. With Jungkook, there was always gentleness in the way he moved his lips and caressed your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>You kissed him. Again and again and again, willing to memorise the way he kissed, the way he smells, the way his lips feel. You want to remember it all now but you know you have a lifetime to and nothing beats that feeling. Suddenly, all the urgency is gone and you find yourself melting into his lips, enjoying every touch, every tingle, every spark going off in your heart.</p><p>\u201cBe safe kids!\u201d You heard Hoseok yell from the living room. Jungkook smiled into the kiss and you found yourself doing the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d You asked when the both of you pulled away for breath.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you wanted it as much as I did.\u201d\u00a0</p>",

He didn\u2019t even had to get you tickets, you had bought them yourself to surprise him, along with a banner that said you were his number one fan.\u00a0</p><p>And in that one year, you also started to slowly fall for him. To you it didn\u2019t make sense. You couldn\u2019t comprehend how\u00a0one day he was just your friend and then the next you suddenly found it hard to breathe when he would come a little closer than he usually would.</p><p>And you knew he liked you too. The signs were obvious, from the way he would text you to ask you if you got home safely to the way he easily gets flustered when the other members tease him about you. You adored the way he would stumble across his words when his cheeks flushed with colour. But the both of you weren\u2019t exactly dating.\u00a0</p><p>Skinny love, the other boys always remind you.</p><p>It was around three months ago when you were alone in the dorm\u2019s kitchen with Seokjin and you confided in him. Jungkook was out of sight, taking a shower after a long day of practice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that you don\u2019t know whether he likes you, it\u2019s so obvious, so why aren\u2019t the both of you together?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you reasoned,\u00a0\u201che should be the one asking me to be his girlfriend, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you confess instead?\u201d His question left you dumbfounded at the idea and as appealing as it sounded, your numerous attempts were met with great failure.</p><p>You had once wrote your confession in black ink on a full Coca-Cola bottle. With jittery nerves and shaky hands, you gave it to Jungkook asking him to drink it hoping he would see it when he finishes. However before he did, a thirsty Jimin snatched it away and threw it in the bin after he was done.\u00a0</p><p>Another time, you had wrote him a letter of confession for him to bring on tour only to find the day after he left that you gave him the wrong piece of paper, one with your history notes instead.\u00a0</p><p>You also had tried the subtle signs, like leaving your hand on the armrest in a movie theatre or giving him a peck on his cheek before he left for tour but he always took it as a friendly signs instead of something more. And suddenly cheeks kisses and hand holding were a norm in your friendship which flustered you greatly all the time.</p><p>You had tried the more obvious ways too, like asking him to go on a pizza date once but Taehyung\u2019s voice was too loud in the background that he had missed the word\u00a0\u2018date\u2019 and you were too embarrassed to repeat yourself.</p><p>So you had given up, you had decided to just wait for him to confess instead.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you mad at me?\u201d Jungkook whispered in your ear just as the game was about to end.\u00a0You weren\u2019t exactly mad, you were just kinda annoyed at the fact that the boys had so obviously put it out there but Jungkook being Jungkook still didn\u2019t get the hint. It wasn\u2019t the first time and it surely wouldn\u2019t be the last either.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You replied quite loudly catching the attention of the other boys in the room but Jungkook didn\u2019t buy it. He knew you well enough to tell that your body expression said otherwise. In normal circumstances, if he ever poked you, you would have poked him right back causing a huge\u00a0\u2018fight\u2019 but this time you just weren\u2019t quite in the mood.</p><p>\u201cJust go talk it out in the room,\u201d Seokjin pleaded. As he was the one you usually confided in, he understood how you felt,\u00a0\u201cand don\u2019t come out until you\u2019re done.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>However, he was met with resistance and stubbornness from the both of you but he didn\u2019t give up. He ended up dragging you into Jungkook\u2019s room as Jungkook followed closely behind like a lost puppy.</p><p>\u201cJust tell him,\u201d he told you as he closed the door shut and walked back to the living room to watch the game.</p><p>The atmosphere in the room was tense and awkward, more than it has ever been with Jungkook. With him, it was always banter and laughter, joy and happiness. This was something new and the tension made your legs weak. You sat down at the edge of his bed and attempted to steady your mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What does hyung know that I don\u2019t?\u201d Jungkook asked as he walked over to you and stared down into your eyes. His eyes held a certain type of softness and it made you weak for him, just like the first day you met him.\u00a0</p><p>You looked back at him, uncertain of how to answer, unsure of how to react without actually confessing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He whined with a pout on his lips.Usually his aegyo didn\u2019t work on you but it did this time and you blamed his pout for what happened next.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t for his pout, you wouldn\u2019t have looked at his lips. If you didn\u2019t look at his lips, you wouldn\u2019t have wondered what it feels like to kiss him and if you didn\u2019t wonder, you wouldn\u2019t have said what you were going to say next.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m going to do something stupid.\u201d You said as you stood up, your eyes merely reaching the tips of his lips. Before he could even respond, you closed your eyes, stood on your tiptoes and touched your lips against his, softly and hesitantly, before pulling away. His lips tasted sugary, like the soda you gave him earlier and it was addictive. Your insides were shaking with fear. You had expected him to push you away. Your hands were trembling with nerves. What had you just done? But the thought that haunted you the most was that you wanted to pull him back in for another.\u00a0</p><p>When you opened your eyes, you were met with a blank look on Jungkook\u2019s face. The only indication that he understood what happened was the colour of his cheeks flushing red. It took a moment for him to process what had just happened before a smile crept onto his lips.</p><p>\u201cDo that again.\u201d He whispered in a hoarse voice.</p><p>He took one step closer towards you and you took a step back, making you fall onto the bed. His arms wrapped around you as you fell, attempting to soften the blow but he ended up crushing you instead.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d You said in between laughter as you rubbed the part of your rib his arm jabbed into. Everything felt clumsy and you liked it because it made everything else feel so insanely real. You liked how the first kiss wasn\u2019t perfect.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He crashed his soft lips onto yours again and you wondered if you would ever forget how they taste like. You hoped that you never do.\u00a0His hands were tangled in your hair in an attempt you pull you closer as yours roamed his chiseled back.\u00a0</p><p>This was finally it. You were kissing him. The months of waiting and wondering showed in the way he touched you. Everything felt more urgent from the pressure on your lips to the way his hands moved but there was still gentleness. With Jungkook, there was always gentleness in the way he moved his lips and caressed your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>You kissed him. Again and again and again, willing to memorise the way he kissed, the way he smells, the way his lips feel. You want to remember it all now but you know you have a lifetime to and nothing beats that feeling. Suddenly, all the urgency is gone and you find yourself melting into his lips, enjoying every touch, every tingle, every spark going off in your heart.</p><p>\u201cBe safe kids!\u201d You heard Hoseok yell from the living room. Jungkook smiled into the kiss and you found yourself doing the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d You asked when the both of you pulled away for breath.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you wanted it as much as I did.\u201d\u00a0</p></p>",

Jungkook had spent over an our whining to you over the phone, insisting that you come over to watch the basketball match and you went anyway, despite the fact that you didn&rsquo;t know much about basketball and the volume of coursework pilling up.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he whispered in your ear once you were close enough. The way his breath fanned your face tickled your ear causing you to emit a length of giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you giggling about?&rdquo; Taehyung asked curiously across the room as he eyed the both of you. Knowing him, he wanted in on the fun the both of you were having.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Jungkook replied defensively with a smirk on his face, unwilling to spill. Taehyung&rsquo;s gaze travelled from his younger member to you, expecting an answer but was met with disappointment as Jungkook&rsquo;s hand covered your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Ew,&nbsp;take it off or I&rsquo;ll lick it,&rdquo; you threatened but you were only met with a firm no from the boy, his eyes gleaming with mischief. Knowing exactly where to target, your hands reached over to poke his sides making him swallow his laughter and squirm in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Get a room.&rdquo; It usually had to be a special occasion when Yoongi&rsquo;s voice would make an appearance as he was always drowned out by the louder members but at times like these he always threw the snarkiest comments.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Or just get together already,&rdquo; Namjoon threw into the wind causing the both of you to stop in your tracks immediately. Like two well punished kindergarten kids, the both of you remained unbelievably quiet the rest of the game. Despite the small pokes you would get from Jungkook time to time, you remained focus on the game and ignored him completely.</p><p>You had met the boy a year ago at a friend&rsquo;s house warming party. It was a small occasion with a few old and new friends. Jungkook was introduced to you there as Bangtan Sonyeondan&rsquo;s golden maknae. To you, BTS wasn&rsquo;t exactly unheard of.&nbsp;His name had always came up in passing between the giggles of schoolgirls and even subway advertisements. You weren&rsquo;t exactly their biggest fan nor did you hate their music which made you quite neutral to the idea of meeting him. Your image of a stuck up arrogant boy, as you imagined most celebrities would be, was immediately shot down when you first met him and the both of you&nbsp;hit it off right from the start. Maybe it was because of the small age difference but it seemed that the both of you spoke in this weird wavelength that no one else could comprehend and you enjoyed it. You liked how you finally found someone who seemed to understand you.</p><p>In that one year, you grew closer to him. In between movie nights and take away Fridays, you met the rest of the boys during one of their dance practice and they seemed to liked you, constantly asking you when you&rsquo;d come over. In that one year, you witnessed Jungkook&rsquo;s passion for music grow as you watched him perform on the stage.
