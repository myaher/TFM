                "content": "<p>they really were the unofficial mom and dad of their little pack. even when its just the two of them with hot pie he&rsquo;s kinda like their dumb kid lol. its definitely the most obvious with weasel. out of everyone arya and gendry were the only ones who went back for that baby (and each other). and yeah gendry might talk shit but he never intended to abandon the group imo. he was just venting because, as the oldest @ like 13/14 (which is still a bb) and biggest, he was (literally) carrying this huge burden of several smaller children all of whom are starving, scared, and, in lommys case, slowly dying. like this is super traumatic for all involved. children should not be subjected to this. arya is ten years old and she&rsquo;s caring for a two year old. its such a good dynamic tho. heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. we see so much growth for arya. she starts out frustrated by this baby because she&rsquo;s just a child herself but in saving her becomes her protector and really bonds with her. which weasel is unsurprisingly very responsive too and starts to cling to arya. honestly i love it so much im gonna post a couple quotes:</p><blockquote><p>At the sound of her voice, Weasel came creeping out from the bushes. Lommy had named her that. He said she looked like a weasel, which wasn&rsquo;t true, but they couldn&rsquo;t keep on calling her the crying girl after she finally stopped crying. Her mouth was filthy. Arya hoped she hadn&rsquo;t been eating mud again. <br /></p><p>The Weasel put her arms around her leg, clutching tight. Sometimes she did that now. <br /></p><p>Arya tugged at the Weasel&rsquo;s matted hair, thinking it might be best to hack it off. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;You leave Weasel alone, she&rsquo;s just scared and hungry is all.&rdquo; Arya glanced back, but the girl was not following for once. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; she told them, putting an arm around Weasel when the little girl came running up. <br /></p><p>And Arya thought, Run, Weasel, run as far as you can, run and hide and never come back. <br /></p></blockquote><p>ok this was actually a mistake because now im crying. weasel clutching tight to arya&rsquo;s leg and arya wrapping her arms around her is just so devastating. oh god and arya taking weasel&rsquo;s name as her alias and even thinking about her in the house of black and white??? rip me. i kinda went on a tangent here but yeah lol a lot of motherhood/fatherhood symbolism. gendrys looking after an entire inn full of orphans. arya has the moon thing going for her also. they&rsquo;d make good parents for the same reason they make a good team: complimentary traits, trust, and respect.&nbsp;</p>",
