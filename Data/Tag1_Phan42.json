It annoys me a lot, tbh, to see a strong and independent character be reduced to a whimpering, submissive mess cause that&rsquo;s necessary to be a bottom, apparently.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s the AU&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love AU&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a really fun writing technique, to take a character and throw them into an unfamiliar situation to see how they&rsquo;d react. But half the time everyone is so OOC that it&rsquo;s like someone wrote an original story before slapping on the characters names and calling it a fanfic. </p><p>The worst of it by far though is when people do this to other, real people. Have you ever read a Dan and Phil fanfiction? Let me tell you, their fanfic personas are nothing like real life. Their characteristics are stripped away until they&rsquo;re just a quintessential Top and Bottom. The friendly banter is replaced with mushy flirting and it&rsquo;s just- </p><p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that just because you love something doesn&rsquo;t mean it belongs to you. You can&rsquo;t call Dan and Phil queerbaiters because they&rsquo;re not a piece of fiction and they haven&rsquo;t promised you anything. You can&rsquo;t be upset when the reality doesn&rsquo;t line up with your headcanons, especially when it&rsquo;s real people.</p><p>So yeah. Maybe don&rsquo;t forget that creators and people are allowed to do what they like and it&rsquo;s completely unfair to expect them to line up with all of your expectations.</p></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br/>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183801485578/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Ten</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183968016711/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eleven</a><br/><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184138802035/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Twelve</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184301494045/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Thirteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184463426719/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fourteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184632676790/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fifteen</a><br/></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184786820304/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Sixteen</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Seventeen</b></p><p>The Fitzgeralds want omelettes for breakfast. But not just one each, Dan learns, when the two adults clean their plates and tell him, patting tummies and grinning, that they\u2019re ready for round two. He\u2019s not sure where the youngest member of their party is hiding, but Dan doesn\u2019t blame her for passing up on watching her parents shovel eggs into their gawping mouths like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Dan has the unfortunate job of telling Louise that she\u2019s expected to fry up unlimited omelettes until the two older Fitzgeralds are completely satisfied. When she smacks him with a yolky wooden spoon, Dan can\u2019t say he blames her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so violent when you\u2019re mad,\u201d Dan complains, dabbing at the yellowish stain on his shirt sleeve. </p><p>Louise shoots him a glare, whisking eggs vigorously in a bowl. \u201cI have good reason to do a lot worse, so I\u2019d scarper if I were you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything worse than what Nikolai is doing to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that\u2019s a viable excuse, I\u2019m going to chop you up and feed you to the Fitzgeralds in their next omelette.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Dan sighs, folding his arms and feeling a lot like a petulant child. \u201cAgree to disagree, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, you cannot fight fire with fire. Nikolai is a powerful man. He\u2019s going to steam roller over you without a second thought if he catches wind of what you\u2019re up to with his man.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, he won\u2019t catch wind. Our wind is thousands of miles away from anyone up here.\u201d That hadn\u2019t come out quite right, Dan thinks, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cNot from everyone,\u201d Louise rightly points out, grinding pepper into the bowl. </p><p>An image of Martyn Lester\u2019s exasperated face flashes into Dan\u2019s mind, and he chews his lip, wondering if he and Phil are anywhere near done chatting yet. They still haven\u2019t left Mona\u2019s office, and it\u2019s been over half an hour. Mona\u2019s going beserk, muttering about etiquette and rudeness, scrubbing tables and dusting corners because she can\u2019t get to her desk. Dan can see her through the serving hatch, polishing the huge balcony windows with irritable vigour.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about Martyn Lester?\u201d Dan asks in an attempt at nonchalance.</p><p>Louise\u2019s lips press together, and she pours some of the egg mixture into the pan. It sizzles pleasantly, immediately beginning to bubble and release a fragrant, delicious aroma. Dan\u2019s stomach rumbles; he hasn\u2019t eaten anything today - too busy sorting out the miraculous appearance of Phil\u2019s sibling. </p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She pauses, prodding at the slowly solidifying omelette with a spatula. \u201cWe used to be pals, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, he quit being Phil\u2019s publicist. Pretty abruptly. Just up and left. I haven\u2019t seen him since he walked out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, brows knitting together. The anger in Louise\u2019s voice is unmistakable, but Dan senses he shouldn\u2019t press the still-sore wound. \u201cDo you know why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI imagine there\u2019s more to it than just this, but he was never Nikolai\u2019s biggest fan,\u201d Louise says, then deftly flips the omelette. \u201cHe told me that the only reason he ever became Phil\u2019s publicist was to prevent Phil from getting fucked by the guy.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, reflecting on her words; her eyes meet Dan\u2019s, and they both snort with laughter. </p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she says, \u201cMartyn\u2019s a protective older brother type. He and Nikolai did a lot of butting heads.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of hard to butt heads with someone who\u2019s never around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s another reason Martyn got so frustrated,\u201d Louise says, shifting omelettes onto plates with swift, practiced movements. \u201cIt was always Cornelia he\u2019d have to argue it out with.\u201d Louise looks at Dan as she shoves plates into his hands. \u201cYou met her, right? The fiery redhead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. She seemed cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t know much more than that, but if he\u2019s here after having quit so dramatically, I\u2019d say it\u2019s doubtful that he brings good tidings.\u201d Louise gives him a \u2018well?\u2019 look, gesturing to the plates in his hands. \u201cOff you go, then.\u201d</p><p>Awash with new information, Dan then turns to the door of the kitchen, and heads out to deliver the Fitzgeralds their second serving. </p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s two in the afternoon, and Phil is avoiding him. There\u2019s no definitive evidence of this, but Dan\u2019s ninety-nine percent sure. He\u2019s been glimpsing Phil all day, through the window in the door of the gym as he works out, hurrying through the lobby in damp clothes, sat at a table in deep conversation with Martyn, but he hasn\u2019t so much as caught Dan\u2019s eye. It\u2019s pissing Dan off to no end, though he\u2019s trying to make excuses for him as his brother\u2019s sudden appearance could mean all sorts of things.\u00a0</p><p>Still, he feels like grabbing Phil by the shoulders and spinning him round so that they\u2019re forced to lock eyes, then telling him <i>\u2018hey, dickhead, you were inside of me last night, the least you can do is nod in my direction, even if you have to wait until Martyn is looking the other way\u2019</i>. </p><p>Dan\u2019s at the front desk, checking in the new couple that have just arrived with Kaspar in tow: Ms Stone and Ms Harris. They\u2019re both in their seventies, and Ms Stone is in a wheelchair, so it\u2019s pretty impressive that they\u2019ve made it up here at all, but they\u2019re perfectly chipper, papery, ungloved hands tightly clasped. Dan hands over their room key, and just as Kaspar is jerking Ms Stone backwards and spinning her, rather alarmingly fast, in the direction of their wheelchair lift, Phil appears from nowhere, at the side of the desk, bright eyes screaming \u2018we need to talk\u2019. </p><p>He says a polite \u201chello\u201d to Kaspar, who bellows an enthusiastic response that makes excessive use of the word \u2018Philly\u2019. Then, seeming not to be able to contain his urgency, Phil turns to Dan, inclining his head towards Mona\u2019s office.</p><p>Dan nods at him, a little annoyed that he\u2019s being so obvious in front of people, but telling himself Phil must have a reason. Phil slinks off, and Dan turns back to Ms Stone and Ms Harris to tell them that he\u2019ll be up shortly to deliver their bags. Just as they\u2019re disappearing from view, Dan\u2019s preparing to creep round to the office when he senses eyes on him. He looks about, searching for the source of the prickling sensation that\u2019s grazing the back of his neck. At the last second, he looks upwards; peering over the edge of the mezzanine rail is the Fitzgerald\u2019s teenage daughter, her blue strands of hair dangling over the wood. </p><p>She\u2019s looking directly at him, her stare wide and unfaltering, like she\u2019s attempting to pierce into his head telepathically. He cocks his head to the side, wondering whether he should call out to her, though he doesn\u2019t even know her first name. Just as he\u2019s debating what to do, she ducks backwards, out of sight, and the moment is snatched away. </p><p>When Dan gets into the office, Phil is leaned up against Mona\u2019s desk like some hip CEO with an \u2018open door policy\u2019 for his office full of workers. He looks weary, which Dan supposes isn\u2019t so surprising, given that he happens to know Phil got a lot less sleep than usual last night, but there\u2019s something underneath it too. A bone-deep exhaustion, so intense that it radiates off him in waves. </p><p>\u201cNikolai\u2019s coming,\u201d Phil says without preamble. Dan\u2019s only just clicked the door shut behind him. He blinks at Phil slowly, a dread creeping over his body from toe to neck. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then feels dumb for not having a better response to hand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Long fingers carve narrow valleys through jet black hair. \u201cApparently someone tipped off the media that Nik and I are definitely breaking it off.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI mean, I thought I already made that pretty obvious at the charity event. Someone had new information though, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who could possibly have any new information?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy guess is one of the vapid yuppies Nikolai has trailing around him 24-7,\u201d Phil replies with a sniff. \u201cMaybe one of them overheard when I called him yesterday. Decided to make a quick buck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Nikolai\u2019s coming here why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been able to contact me about all the new stories flying about, so he got in touch with Martyn, figuring he\u2019d be able to snag my attention,\u201d Phil says, sounding bitter.\u00a0\u201cMartyn listened to Nik ranting about my radio silence for roughly thirty seconds and then hopped on a plane to warn me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, why hasn\u2019t Nik been able to contact you?\u201d Dan asks, too sharpened from nerves to care about the details.\u00a0\u201cI thought he was texting you constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, he was.\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes, which have been glazed, staring into the near distance, refocus on Dan. The corner of his mouth twitches, and one of his sleek, dark eyebrows arches upwards. \u201cAnd then I suddenly became somewhat preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then trips over what seems to be his own foot. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s little amused smile is not as laser-focused on Dan as he\u2019s grown accustomed. Dan gets the distinct feeling that whilst Phil is still all too happy to have a chuckle over his idiocy, his conscious brain is somewhere else. It\u2019s kind of unpleasant to suddenly have the spotlight whisked off him, after having been the sole focus of Phil\u2019s attention for so long. He kind of wants to snap his fingers in front of those blue eyes and bring him back into the room.<br/></p><p>\u201cNik likes to be the centre of a scandal, but only when he\u2019s in control of it,\u201d Phil muses, arms folding across his chest. He\u2019s silent for a moment, and Dan can practically see the wheels turning in his brain. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something else, too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dan\u2019s heart picks up its pace. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rumour, apparently, that I have\u2026 someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike, someone that\u2019s making me want to leave my husband.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s breathing stalls. He feels Mona\u2019s floor cracking beneath his feet. \u201cSurely people can\u2019t know about-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how,\u201d Phil says, running a hand through his hair again. It seems to be an unconscious action, whenever he feels stressed. \u201cBut we should probably be careful.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Careful</i>?\u201d Dan repeats, astounded. \u201cYou mean like subtly beckoning me in here to talk in private, right in front of brand new guests? And Kaspar?\u201d Phil gives him a look, but Dan can feel himself getting worked up. If he stays in this small room with Phil for much longer, he\u2019s going to boil over and say something he regrets. \u201cI-I have to get out of here-\u201d</p><p>Behind him, the latch of the door twitches before he so much as moves a muscle. Dan knows this because he\u2019s leant against it; the wooden lever is digging into the small of his back. He locks eyes with Phil, alarmed, and witnesses what he imagines is reflection of his own fear painting Phil\u2019s face. The latch lifts properly this time, and the door pushes against Dan, but he uses all his weight to prevent it opening. </p><p>He mouths <i>\u2018help me\u2019</i> to Phil, who jumps to action at once, coming to assist Dan as he holds the door closed. From the other side, Mona\u2019s voice calls, \u201cwho\u2019s in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Dan hisses under his breath. The door rattles; she\u2019s growing impatient. </p><p>Phil is staring searching Dan\u2019s face for some kind of plan. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Mona,\u201d Phil calls out. Dan gapes at him. Surely he cannot be about to reveal that the two of them are in here, alone, seconds after telling Dan they need to keep their shit on the DL. \u201cMy brother and I needed the office again. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause. The door stops rattling. \u201cWhy is the door locked?\u201d </p><p>Dan presses his mouth together, trying not to breathe too loudly, in case Mona could recognise the air rushing from his lungs. Phil looks skyward, grasping for a response. \u201cWe, uh, didn\u2019t want to be disturbed. It\u2019s a serious, uh, matter we\u2019re discussing. Could you just give us five more minutes, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Novokoric, I really need to get to my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Phil begs, then squeezes his eyes shut. </p><p>Dan bites his lip, praying. Eventually, Mona says, \u201cfine. But after that, you\u2019ll have to find somewhere else to go. Like your suite, perhaps. Or Mr Lester\u2019s perfectly adequate room.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, shooting Dan a look of relief. \u201cThanks, Mona.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFive minutes!\u201d </p><p>The sound of her kitten heels click-clacking away are like music to Dan\u2019s ears. He blows out a huge puff of air, slumping against the door. \u201cFuck, that was close. No idea how we\u2019d have explained that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we weren\u2019t even doing anything fun to explain away,\u201d Phil says regretfully,\u00a0aiming a half-smile at Dan.</p><p>He tries not to return it, but fails spectacularly. \u201cI should go,\u201d Dan says, partly because he can sense this conversation heading into dangerous territory, and what they absolutely do not need is for Mona to come back in five minutes and walk in on something even worse. \u201cLet me out first, you follow in a minute or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Dan,\u201d Phil says, grabbing hold of his arm. He lets go pretty fast, but it was a telling move. Dan stops, waiting to hear him out. \u201cI- I know this is all\u2026 not ideal. I didn\u2019t know Martyn was coming, and obviously the timing is pretty crap what with everything that happened last night\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan blushes, looking away. \u201cThat\u2019s family for you, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with Nik coming, I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll next get a chance to\u2026\u201d Phil trails off, and Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. Phil laughs at his expression. \u201cTo be alone. To talk. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYeah, I guess that wouldn\u2019t be wise whilst they\u2019re all\u2026 watching.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Phil says, leaning back on his hands. His cheeks are vaguely stained with magenta. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>A beam of clear, glossy light pierces Dan\u2019s mind, softening his pounding heart. He recognises this half-conversation. Phil is asking for something, without using real words. A tiny smile playing on his mouth, Dan steps in front of him, takes his dumb, emotionally stunted face in both hands, and kisses him, soft and slow. He only lets it last a moment, just long enough for the taste of Phil\u2019s tongue to seep through, so Dan can remember it. </p><p>He leans back, and says, \u201ccatch you later. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, eyes flicking towards the ceiling for a moment before landing back on Dan. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says quietly, then moves away from the door so Dan can open it. As he steps through, back into the lobby, Dan turns for a final look. Phil\u2019s watching him with a worried expression, though he does give Dan a tiny wave. \u201cGo do some work,\u201d he says gruffly, then turns back into the office, breaking their gaze. </p><p>*</p><p>Not even fifteen minutes after exiting Mona\u2019s office, Dan\u2019s dragging Ms Stone\u2019s and Ms Harris\u2019 cases up the stairs when he hears a sound he vividly remembers being traumatised by at an earlier date. The fact that he knows the deafening rumble from overhead is not an earthquake or avalanche does not make it any less chilling. Dan stops mid-flight of stairs and cranes his neck upwards, as if he could see through the roof of the hotel, then pierce through the steel of the plane into the cabin where Nikolai Novokoric is no doubt lounging in a reclining seat, sipping champagne. </p><p>He listens to the plane swoop low, then hit the tarmac, the engine stuttering, then cutting out entirely. With a desperate sigh, Dan continues his climb to the second floor, bags in tow. </p><p>*</p><p>Nikolai\u2019s shrill, grating voice echoes off the wooden walls of the hotel from the moment he walks through the door. A shudder runs through Dan\u2019s body as he hears those first few notes of posh, slightly Swiss bolstering. To escape, he goes to clean room two, the Fitzgerald\u2019s room, whilst they\u2019re out on a hike with Kaspar. They hadn\u2019t been enthusiastic to go, but as they\u2019re on an all expenses paid for trip, they couldn\u2019t exactly argue with Mona when she\u2019d scheduled it for them. </p><p>Dan closes the door behind him, breathing a long sigh. It feels like the first moment he\u2019s been alone in days, although of course that\u2019s not true. The Fitzgerald\u2019s room is a tip, and it\u2019s not all that surprising. Their mini fridge has been gutted, and there are packets of peanuts and mini liquor bottles scattered on every available surface. It\u2019s a family room, with a double bed on one side, and a single bed against the window. The single bed is half-heartedly made, but the double is in complete disarray - the pillows are dumped on the floor and the sheets are stained with what looks like Dorito dust. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected,\u201d Dan mutters to himself. </p><p>He\u2019s just setting to work when he realises that above the mundane cleaning noises, he can still hear Nikolai somewhere downstairs - his loud, boisterous laughter and fake enthusiasm. He needs a distraction, badly, but doesn\u2019t have anything to hand. He supposes he could call his mother back, at last. He hasn\u2019t spoken to her since the day after he arrived at The Secret of the Alps, so he owes her a phone call. He can do it as he works, perhaps that will make it easier to stomach. </p><p>With twitching fingers Dan pulls out his phone and dials his childhood home number, before he can talk himself out of it. She picks up on the third ring. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He swallows, throat tightening. Is it possible that he already regrets phoning her when all she\u2019s said is his name? \u201cHi, Mum.\u201d </p><p>He sets the phone to loudspeaker, and crouches down to begin emptying the overflowing wastepaper bin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in weeks.\u201d</p><p>Wow, straight in with the guilt trip. No point wasting time, he supposes. \u201cNo. Sorry. I\u2019ve been very busy here. Long work days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>The phone crackles. It\u2019s an excruciating sound. To dispel the awkwardness, Dan asks, \u201chow\u2019ve things been?\u201d </p><p>She sighs loudly. \u201cFine, fine. Your father\u2019s had that ear thing again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. He ties the rubbish bag tightly, then sets it by the door. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Hope he gets it sorted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you know what he\u2019s like about seeing doctors. Stubborn old man, just like his son.\u201d</p><p>Dan knows, he <i>knows</i> it\u2019s a provocation, intent on riling him up, but he still falls for it. \u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo listen to your mother, and come home,\u201d his mother says, her voice slipping into the one Dan is so used to, sharp and cold. \u201cI know what\u2019s best for you, Daniel. You\u2019re too young make such a hugely affecting decision. Throwing away your chance at a degree, it\u2019s reckless! You\u2019ll end up with no money, stuck in a low-paying job forever-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t important to me, Mum.\u201d He heads for the double bed, starting to throw pillows onto it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt will be important to you when you run out of it,\u201d his mum replies with a sniff. </p><p>\u201cI have a job,\u201d Dan says slowly, as if drawing out the syllables could help her understand the one thing she\u2019s always failed to. In his hand he clasps a pillow, ready to be screamed into at any moment. \u201cI have savings, and a place to live. I\u2019m getting by just fine. I don\u2019t see what the point is of forcing myself to toil through a degree in a subject I hate, to secure a job I\u2019ll despise, racking up a load of debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being naiive,\u201d she says, for what must be the hundredth time. Dan sighs, flopping down onto on the floor by the Fitzgeralds\u2019 bed, abandoning all attempt at continuing the clean. \u201cThe world won\u2019t be kind to you if you\u2019re unintelligent and unqualified. What do you suppose you\u2019re going to do with yourself? Change beds in a hotel up God-knows-what-mountain forever? It\u2019s just not realistic-\u201d</p><p>Dan looks at the pillow he\u2019s still holding, wondering if she\u2019s somehow able to sense that he\u2019s doing exactly that. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I would be doing this forever.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s arms wrap around the pillow, miserably. He\u2019s trembling slightly, because he detests so much as thinking about his future given that it\u2019s so uncertain. He\u2019s here now, for the foreseeable weeks ahead, and that\u2019s some stability at least. He curls his fingers into the pillow\u2019s soft material, trying to breathe through the anxiety attack he can feel brewing. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late for you to come back, you know,\u201d his mum says; her voice is kinder now, the edges softened. It would be so easy to fall into the trap of her mumsy words, to run back down the mountain into her arms. She\u2019d waste no time in calling up the University and re-enrolling him in his awful law degree, then locking him straight back into his prison-cell dorm room. \u201cYour dad and I would sort it all out for you,\u201d she says, like she can read his mind,\u00a0\u201cit hasn\u2019t been too long, we could talk to people, chalk this up to a minor blip in judgement.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Dan mouths some things he wants to say, but won\u2019t. <i>Why can\u2019t you try to understand me properly? Why don\u2019t my opinions matter just because I\u2019m young? Why would I want to be a lawyer, miserable in my office for the next fifty years just like Dad\u2019s been, living for the weekend like that\u2019s the way life\u2019s supposed to be lived?</i></p><p>\u201cYou know, I saw on Facebook that Beth is still single,\u201d his mum says in a hesitant voice, and that\u2019s the moment Dan decides the catch-up is over. </p><p>\u201cI have to go, mum,\u201d Dan says, proud that his voice cracks only a small amount as he reaches for the phone. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of my shift.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, Dan,\u201d his mum says quickly, and something about the urgency of her voice makes him listen. His thumb hovers over the red \u2018end call\u2019 button. \u201cI&hellip; had Vanessa and Darren round for lunch yesterday. They were talking about some scandal that\u2019s been in the news. About that young heir of the Swiss Royal family. The gay one, you know.\u201d</p><p>Icy fingers wrap around Dan\u2019s heart. He reminds himself to remain calm, that there\u2019s no way she could possibly know he has any involvement. \u201cHe\u2019s bisexual, actually,\u201d Dan corrects in a mock-casual voice. \u201cVanessa and Darren had fascinating insights into the situation I\u2019m sure, but Mum, I really have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anything of it at first,\u201d his mum continues, like Dan hadn\u2019t spoken. There\u2019s something wrong with her voice. It\u2019s too shrill, too forced. \u201cBut I was thinking it over later, and I realised I <i>knew</i> the place this Sir Nicholas\u2019 husband is rumoured to be. It\u2019s the same mountain you told me your hotel is on.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes flutter closed. This surely can<i>not</i> be happening. His mother barely remembers his birthday, let alone the specific mountain in the vast range of the Alps he decided to run off to. </p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dan says, because anything else would be too incriminating. </p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d his mother says in a small, strangled voice. \u201cOh, God, it\u2019s you darling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s me?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes squeeze together; but even as he wishes for anything else, he knows she\u2019s guessed the truth. Her shame is like poison, seeping out of the phone into his ear, plucking Dan\u2019s worst anxieties from their dark corners.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI always knew there was something you were keeping from me,\u201d she half-wails in a soft, crackly voice. \u201cSome reason you tucked away inside that you felt made you- you <i>different</i> from everyone else. Oh Dan, honey, this is so not the way to deal with it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it when I had the thought, but I went back through those texts you sent me when you first arrived,\u201d his mum says in a rush. \u201cAbout the famous guest who you didn\u2019t get along with, how you were dreading spending so much time alone with him. It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it, Dan? It\u2019s the one they\u2019re all saying is- is- cheating. With a waiter.\u201d </p><p>Dan lets the disdain in her voice slip through his skin, burrow into his well of shame that\u2019s already deep and bubbling.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond for a while, weighing up all the things he could try and say to dissuade her, to convince her that she\u2019s wrong. Instead, wearied by even the thought of exerting himself to insist such a lie is true, he just corrects her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a concierge, not a waiter.\u201d His mum lets out a sort of sob-noise. \u201cMum,\u201d Dan says quickly, frightened by her reaction suddenly, \u201cyou can\u2019t tell anyone. Mum, do you understand?\u201d </p><p>She breathes thickly. \u201cOh, God, Dan, this is- why did you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned it,\u201d Dan says, feeling his hackles rise. \u201cThis is so typical of you, Mum, judging me from afar, all my choices and decisions when you have no idea about any of it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain this to me!\u201d she cries, still unbearably shrill. \u201cIs this as bright of a decision as dropping out of university, or breaking up with your lovely girlfriend, or running away to scrub toilets up a mountain?! What on earth are you thinking, you daft-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him!\u201d Dan interrupts, the words surging out of him like vomit. His eyes widen as soon as they\u2019re out, as if he can see them hanging in the air before him, hovering like flies above the Fitzgeralds\u2019 bag of trash. \u201cI- I mean, I care about him. I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know why I said- forget that. But I do care. His marriage is toxic, Mum. If you knew the truth, if the rest of the world knew - if Vanessa and Derren knew what Nikolai was <i>like</i>-\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d his mum asks, weakly. \u201cThey\u2019d fall in love with him, too?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan leaves the Fitzgeralds room without finishing the clean; his conversation with his mother has left him too agitated to focus on something so mundane. He remembers now - too late, of course - why he\u2019s been so reluctant to call her back. He had not left home on good terms with his parents - his father refused to even say goodbye. They\u2019ve always been hideously conservative in their views, so Dan with his liberal politics and marginally effeminate\u00a0\u2018emo\u2019 dress sense growing up had never really been their idea of the perfect son.\u00a0</p><p>Through school he\u2019d rebelled against them, which only made everyone unhappy, so once he was older, he tried the opposite - to do what they wanted, to conform to their ideals of being a straight, cisgender young version of his father, on track to be a lawyer. But this was never good enough for them either, probably because it made Dan so miserable that he never truly gave it all he\u2019d got. It\u2019s always seemed to Dan that nothing he did would ever quite please them, so he\u2019d run off instead, done the thing he knew would upset them and said\u00a0\u2018fuck the consequences\u2019. There\u2019s no point trying to explain his actions to either of them - not that his father would so much as speak to him, probably - because Dan doesn\u2019t have answers or reasons for his actions right now, and that\u2019s not what they want to hear.\u00a0</p><p>To distract himself from the thousands of pounding, unpleasant thoughts rampaging through his mind, Dan heads for the stairs, intending to try and creep through the mezzanine without being seen. At a furtive glance, Dan sees the lounge area is rammed with people, some of which are spilling out onto the balcony, through the doors that have been opened. The sleet storm is dying down, but it\u2019s not completely over, meaning that some speckles of icy water are flying in. </p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t know for sure of course, but he highly doubts that Mona would have been the one to allow this, so it\u2019s probably a Nikolai-request. He\u2019s almost across the room, at the top of the stairs leading down to the lobby, when Mona spots him. </p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d she near-shrieks, sounding seconds away from an even wilder tone of voice. \u201cDan, could you come here, please? Now?\u201d</p><p>Suppressing a loud scream, Dan fixes a wobbly smile in place, and heads towards her. He notes that every single chair is occupied - people have pulled out beanbag chairs, trunks and stools, and crammed around the scatter of tables. It\u2019s unnerving to see the room so teeming with bodies when it\u2019s usually empty enough that Dan could dance through it in his underwear (provided Louise didn\u2019t choose the wrong moment to look through the serving hatch). </p><p>Some of the people are familiar to Dan and some are new to him. Most of the people he doesn\u2019t recognise are huddled together in matching slate grey suits, or grouped around enormous cameras, microphones in their hands. The Fitzgeralds have managed to snag their own table in the midst of it all, looking far too excited (minus their daughter, who is plugged into her iPhone, looking extremely like Dan at that age whenever he was forcibly taken to a social situation he didn\u2019t want to be at). The Fitzgeralds are talking animatedly at Max the security man, who has squished all of his beefy, six-foot-two frame into a beanbag, arms folded, staring stoically ahead.\u00a0</p><p>Ms Stone and Ms Harris are here as well, sipping tea and looking mildly alarmed - but interested - at their unusual surroundings. Dan also spots Cornelia in the corner by the TV, talking into a mobile phone and looking decidedly unhappy about something Dan is sure would push anyone except her into crisis mode. Bryony and Hazel are leaning through the serving hatch laughing about something with Louise. PJ is flitting about, stuck to the walls with his camera to his eye, photographing seemingly everything from the sleet stains on the wooden floor to the whiskers decorating Max\u2019s chin. And Nikolai is here, of course, strolling in through the balcony doors in his long stylish coat, brushing sleet from his shoulders like it should have known better than to settle there. </p><p>When he sees Dan, he grins widely, and Dan senses the oncoming hug before it happens. Engulfed in Nikolai\u2019s cold, damp arms, the only thought pumping through Dan\u2019s treacherous mind is, most helpfully,\u00a0<i>your husband fucked my brains out last night</i>.</p><p>He manages not to let this slip off his tongue, mercifully. When Nikolai releases him, he grins again. \u201cMy favourite concierge!\u201d he bellows, slapping Dan on the shoulder. Dan wonders if Louise was right about him instantly forgetting the names of people he doesn\u2019t care about. \u201cI was wondering where you were being kept! Didn\u2019t let the place fall off the cliff then, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d Dan says, managing a weak smile as he surreptitiously rubs his shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t get the chance. Mona took over responsibility before disaster struck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAtta boy,\u201d Nikolai says; his weird accent does not suit the phrase and he seems to know it, judging by the way he clears his throat and claps his hands, distracting attention. \u201cRight everyone, I know we said an outdoor shoot would be preferable, but the weather is against us, so I suggest you set up right here. I\u2019ve been informed that <i>he </i>will be five minutes.\u201d </p><p>Dan badly hopes that the \u2018he\u2019 in question is the abominable snowman, but somehow he doubts it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c&hellip;doing my best to make sure everyone has a drink and a place to sit, but you\u2019ll need to help me keep an eye\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan realises, belatedly, that he\u2019s been so busy half-glaring at Nikolai\u2019s big, dumb head that he hasn\u2019t been hearing a word Mona is whispering to him. </p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.\u201d Dan leans in a bit closer to her. \u201cAny idea what this is all about?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Mona replies, then darts away from him to where a slate-grey-suit man is beckoning her. </p><p>Dan sighs, scanning the crowd of people for any signs that someone might be in need of further refreshment. Nikolai has, thankfully, gone over to talk to Cornelia, so Dan is free of further sickening smalltalk with the man. He turns around, hoping to escape and hide in the kitchen so Louise can explain what the fuck is going on, when he bumps straight into Martyn Lester. He looks\u2026 completely different to this morning. His hair is neat and coiffed, he\u2019s wearing a suit and black tie, and he has an earpiece over one ear. </p><p>\u201cAfternoon, Dan,\u201d he says with a wry smile. \u201cHaving fun at the party?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe host isn\u2019t one of my best friends,\u201d Dan says carefully, inclining his head towards Nikolai. It\u2019s a bit of a risky comment, given that this man is Nikolai\u2019s brother in law, but he\u2019s hoping Louise wasn\u2019t fibbing when she claimed Martyn loathed him. </p><p>Martyn follows Dan\u2019s inclination, smile falling away. He looks quickly at the ground. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t blame you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the secret agent get up?\u201d Dan asks, gesturing to Martyn\u2019s new outfit. He\u2019s not sure what it is, but something about Martyn Lester gives of an inherently calming vibe, like he\u2019s radiating the single statement \u2018I have everything under control\u2019. Perhaps it\u2019s an older brother thing. Or, more likely, it\u2019s because he vaguely resembles Phil with his confident stance, and exhausted-yet-amused-by-everyone\u2019s-ignorance air. \u201cYou planning on taking him out?\u201d </p><p>Martyn sucks in a breath through his teeth. \u201cWouldn\u2019t say that too loud. Max has the ears of a Silverwing and the biceps of a Silverback.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at him blankly. </p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s a bat, one\u2019s a gorilla,\u201d Martyn explains. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, \u201cI, uh, dropped out of uni.\u201d </p><p>Martyn looks at him strangely. \u201cAre you blaming your abandoned law degree for not knowing your species\u2019 of animals by heart?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, no, I-\u201d Dan breaks off, replaying the question in confusion. \u201cHow did you know it was a law degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, attention everyone,\u201d Nikolai booms, striding into the centre of the room, whipping his coat off as he goes. He tosses the garment in seemingly no particular direction and Hazel lunges forwards to catch it before it hits the ground. Nikolai doesn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cMy soon to be ex-husband has finally decided to emerge from his lair, so we\u2019ll start the interview in one minute, then move on to photos, then&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Dan stops listening, too intent on scanning the room for Phil. He spots him at the edge of the crowd, arms folded, looking perfect and polished - an action figure intent on some actual action, but being forced to remain pretty and dust-free, displayed on a shelf. </p><p>Martyn leaves Dan\u2019s side with a murmured excuse, at once heading to stand with his brother. Across the room, Dan notices Cornelia notice Phil\u2019s appearance as well, and take a step in his direction, but upon seeing Martyn, she stops dead in her tracks, eyes wide and round, then turns abruptly away again. Dan frowns at the peculiar behaviour he\u2019s just witnessed, vaguely recalling something Louise mentioned about she and Martyn having to argue out publicist-related drama between Phil and Nikolai a great deal when Martyn still worked for Phil.</p><p>At present, Martyn looks a lot like he still does work for Phil; he\u2019s currently steering Phil into the centre of the room, pushing quite firmly as he obviously doesn\u2019t want to move. Dan tries to catch Phil\u2019s eye, to smile sympathetically, but Phil won\u2019t look at him. He notes that Phil is wearing a tightly knotted scarf-thing around his throat, which was smart of him. Dan knows far too well that the hickey that scarf hides is, as of last night, just as vibrant as ever. </p><p>Martyn stands Phil on a small wooden crate that\u2019s been put out, and Nikolai hops deftly up onto another at his side, unfazed. Everything about Phil\u2019s body language screams discomfort, only growing worse with all the eyes on him. Along with the pang of sympathy that surges up in Dan\u2019s chest, swoops the echo of what his mum said earlier - what <i>Dan</i> had said earlier even - how that\u00a0\u2018L\u2019 word had just slipped out. Effortless, like it had been poised on the tip of his tongue for days.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s never used that word for anyone outside of family before, not even Beth. It must have been an accidental slip-up, born of a desperate desire not to let his mum win the argument, but how bizarre that it chose now to make a random appearance. He cannot possibly have fallen for Phil of all people, the man who consistently infuriates and aggravates him, who has a husband that would feel no remorse if he stepped on Dan\u2019s face on his way out of the building. To fall in love - even the <i>word </i>is terrifying - with anyone, let alone the person he should resist developing any feelings for whatsoever, is not comprehensible. He refuses to so much as dare to believe it.\u00a0</p><p>Even so, Dan wouldn\u2019t wish this kind of horrible, judgemental scrutiny on anyone, let alone Phil (who he does, admittedly, care for - he wasn\u2019t lying about that).</p><p>Martyn nods at Phil seriously, telling him something with those matching blue eyes alone, and then steps aside. Nikolai glances at Phil, who doesn\u2019t look back, and sighs. \u201cOkay. First question.\u201d </p><p>Hands shoot up; there are four reporters as far as Dan can see - each with their own mini team of tech crew. The first is a woman in a bright red blazer, who Nikolai gestures to with a silky wave of his hand. </p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai, how are you feeling in the wake of your husband\u2019s desire to divorce?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDevastated, of course,\u201d Nikolai says sombrely, hands clasped at his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to give Philip all he could ever wish for, but evidently, that was not enough.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s hands curl into fists; he looks at Phil, wondering what he\u2019ll add, but he\u2019s just staring at the floor, lips thin and tight. Nikolai gestures to the next reporter, an attractive, honey-haired woman with dark lipstick and a darker fitted blazer tight on her skinny waist. </p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai,\u201d she says in a low voice, ducking her head in a small bow, \u201cwould you address the recent rumours of your husband\u2019s adultery?</p><p>Nikolai laughs, straightening his tie. \u201cNo more than idle gossip sold for a price,\u201d he says airily; Dan tries to keep very still, but he gets the sense that several people are watching him closely. Probably Louise, for one. Nikolai laughs again in a long trill. \u201cFor starters, who on Earth would he be cheating with up here-\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s loosening his scarf, drawing Nikolai\u2019s attention, making him break off before the sentence ends. It\u2019s a subtle move, barely noticeable to anyone else, but Dan catches it. Nikolai pauses, zeroing in on something that Dan can\u2019t see, that nobody can see except him, standing right beside Phil, but that Dan can easily guess at.\u00a0</p><p>What the fuck is Phil playing at? Dan wonders, heartbeat pounding in his ears. It\u2019s almost like he <i>wants</i> Nikolai to see- Oh. </p><p>In a flash, Dan understands. He does want Nikolai to see the bruise. He wants him to know that the media had been right, there is a \u2018someone\u2019. Phil wants to hurt him. Nikolai is still not saying anything. There\u2019s a shadow passing over his sharp, handsome features. And then, in the next instant, it\u2019s vanished, flicked away out of the balcony doors, his easy, carefully morose expression back in position. Dan lets out a sigh of relief, quietly. Phil re-knots the scarf. </p><p>Nikolai gestures to a man with a dark widow\u2019s peak cutting a severe expression into his forehead.\u00a0\u201cNext question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai, it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d the man says in a deep, slimy voice; Dan likens it to gooey, dark molasses. \u201cWhat prompted the sudden split?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wish I could tell you,\u201d Nikolai says with a sad smile. He looks at Phil, who is still staring straight down at the ground, and heaves a long-suffering sigh. \u201cBut alas, Philip is the only one who could answer that question. I\u2019m still very much in love.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, the sound loud and obvious in the hushed room. He brings his hand to his mouth, immediately feigning a coughing fit. As he\u2019s spluttering, he snags Cornelia\u2019s eye across the room; she\u2019s laughing silently at him. </p><p>\u201cYes, my question is for Philip?\u201d the large, bespectacled lady Nikolai has waved to says, peering over her glasses at Phil. Phil doesn\u2019t move, but Dan senses a collective intake of breath shudder through the room, which is then held in thirty or so sets of lungs. \u201cHow has your marriage to Nikolai been?\u201d </p><p>Slowly, Phil lifts his head. He stares the lady full in the face; there\u2019s no mistaking the white hot fury in his eyes now that they\u2019re visible. \u201cGo to hell,\u201d he spits out. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll experience it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>A moment of shocked silence stretches, elastic and loaded, and then it snaps, the room erupting into noise. The reporters abandon Nikolai\u2019s \u2018hands up\u2019 system and start angrily yelling their questions, shouting over each other as chairs scrape backwards and Nikolai\u2019s various staff members jump up to keep everything under control. The most angry of the lot is the reporter Phil told to go to hell, perhaps understandably, and she charges towards the makeshift podiums, only to trip on her way and launch forwards into Nikolai\u2019s legs. </p><p>Nikolai stumbles and falls backwards, landing directly on his ass on the wooden floor behind. Shrieks of distress echo through the room, most of them coming from Mrs Fitzgerald, and seemingly everybody rushes to help Nikolai up, except Dan and Phil, who both stand rigidly in the midst of the commotion, turning to lock eyes across people\u2019s bobbing heads. </p><p>Finally, Dan is able to send him that sympathetic smile, but Phil just looks desperately miserable, and doesn\u2019t manage to return it. So instead, Dan mouths \u2018you fucked that up\u2019. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches then, just a tad, but still enough for Dan to know he got through. Warm, syrupy pride courses through Dan\u2019s veins, just from knowing he\u2019s able to make Phil feel even a tiny bit better in such a horrendous situation. Phil turns to watch Nikolai being dusted off for a moment, and as he looks away, Dan realises what the sweet, soft, melted-butter-on-toast feeling consuming him must be. He <i>loves</i> this pompous idiot with a fuse shorter than most matches.</p><p>Phil fixes that gellid blue gaze back on him and rolls his eyes in regard to Nikolai\u2019s theatrics. And right then, in that moment Dan knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that he\u2019s completely, Royally fucked.\u00a0</p><p><b>(<a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/185111534550/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eighteen!</a>)</b></p>",

When she smacks him with a yolky wooden spoon, Dan can\u2019t say he blames her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so violent when you\u2019re mad,\u201d Dan complains, dabbing at the yellowish stain on his shirt sleeve. </p><p>Louise shoots him a glare, whisking eggs vigorously in a bowl. \u201cI have good reason to do a lot worse, so I\u2019d scarper if I were you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything worse than what Nikolai is doing to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that\u2019s a viable excuse, I\u2019m going to chop you up and feed you to the Fitzgeralds in their next omelette.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan sighs, folding his arms and feeling a lot like a petulant child. \u201cAgree to disagree, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, you cannot fight fire with fire. Nikolai is a powerful man. He\u2019s going to steam roller over you without a second thought if he catches wind of what you\u2019re up to with his man.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, he won\u2019t catch wind. Our wind is thousands of miles away from anyone up here.\u201d That hadn\u2019t come out quite right, Dan thinks, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cNot from everyone,\u201d Louise rightly points out, grinding pepper into the bowl. </p><p>An image of Martyn Lester\u2019s exasperated face flashes into Dan\u2019s mind, and he chews his lip, wondering if he and Phil are anywhere near done chatting yet. They still haven\u2019t left Mona\u2019s office, and it\u2019s been over half an hour. Mona\u2019s going beserk, muttering about etiquette and rudeness, scrubbing tables and dusting corners because she can\u2019t get to her desk. Dan can see her through the serving hatch, polishing the huge balcony windows with irritable vigour.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about Martyn Lester?\u201d Dan asks in an attempt at nonchalance.</p><p>Louise\u2019s lips press together, and she pours some of the egg mixture into the pan. It sizzles pleasantly, immediately beginning to bubble and release a fragrant, delicious aroma. Dan\u2019s stomach rumbles; he hasn\u2019t eaten anything today - too busy sorting out the miraculous appearance of Phil\u2019s sibling. </p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She pauses, prodding at the slowly solidifying omelette with a spatula. \u201cWe used to be pals, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, he quit being Phil\u2019s publicist. Pretty abruptly. Just up and left. I haven\u2019t seen him since he walked out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, brows knitting together. The anger in Louise\u2019s voice is unmistakable, but Dan senses he shouldn\u2019t press the still-sore wound. \u201cDo you know why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI imagine there\u2019s more to it than just this, but he was never Nikolai\u2019s biggest fan,\u201d Louise says, then deftly flips the omelette. \u201cHe told me that the only reason he ever became Phil\u2019s publicist was to prevent Phil from getting fucked by the guy.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, reflecting on her words; her eyes meet Dan\u2019s, and they both snort with laughter. </p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she says, \u201cMartyn\u2019s a protective older brother type. He and Nikolai did a lot of butting heads.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of hard to butt heads with someone who\u2019s never around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s another reason Martyn got so frustrated,\u201d Louise says, shifting omelettes onto plates with swift, practiced movements. \u201cIt was always Cornelia he\u2019d have to argue it out with.\u201d Louise looks at Dan as she shoves plates into his hands. \u201cYou met her, right? The fiery redhead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. She seemed cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t know much more than that, but if he\u2019s here after having quit so dramatically, I\u2019d say it\u2019s doubtful that he brings good tidings.\u201d Louise gives him a \u2018well?\u2019 look, gesturing to the plates in his hands. \u201cOff you go, then.\u201d</p><p>Awash with new information, Dan then turns to the door of the kitchen, and heads out to deliver the Fitzgeralds their second serving. </p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s two in the afternoon, and Phil is avoiding him. There\u2019s no definitive evidence of this, but Dan\u2019s ninety-nine percent sure. He\u2019s been glimpsing Phil all day, through the window in the door of the gym as he works out, hurrying through the lobby in damp clothes, sat at a table in deep conversation with Martyn, but he hasn\u2019t so much as caught Dan\u2019s eye. It\u2019s pissing Dan off to no end, though he\u2019s trying to make excuses for him as his brother\u2019s sudden appearance could mean all sorts of things.\u00a0</p><p>Still, he feels like grabbing Phil by the shoulders and spinning him round so that they\u2019re forced to lock eyes, then telling him <i>\u2018hey, dickhead, you were inside of me last night, the least you can do is nod in my direction, even if you have to wait until Martyn is looking the other way\u2019</i>. </p><p>Dan\u2019s at the front desk, checking in the new couple that have just arrived with Kaspar in tow: Ms Stone and Ms Harris. They\u2019re both in their seventies, and Ms Stone is in a wheelchair, so it\u2019s pretty impressive that they\u2019ve made it up here at all, but they\u2019re perfectly chipper, papery, ungloved hands tightly clasped. Dan hands over their room key, and just as Kaspar is jerking Ms Stone backwards and spinning her, rather alarmingly fast, in the direction of their wheelchair lift, Phil appears from nowhere, at the side of the desk, bright eyes screaming \u2018we need to talk\u2019. </p><p>He says a polite \u201chello\u201d to Kaspar, who bellows an enthusiastic response that makes excessive use of the word \u2018Philly\u2019. Then, seeming not to be able to contain his urgency, Phil turns to Dan, inclining his head towards Mona\u2019s office.</p><p>Dan nods at him, a little annoyed that he\u2019s being so obvious in front of people, but telling himself Phil must have a reason. Phil slinks off, and Dan turns back to Ms Stone and Ms Harris to tell them that he\u2019ll be up shortly to deliver their bags. Just as they\u2019re disappearing from view, Dan\u2019s preparing to creep round to the office when he senses eyes on him. He looks about, searching for the source of the prickling sensation that\u2019s grazing the back of his neck. At the last second, he looks upwards; peering over the edge of the mezzanine rail is the Fitzgerald\u2019s teenage daughter, her blue strands of hair dangling over the wood. </p><p>She\u2019s looking directly at him, her stare wide and unfaltering, like she\u2019s attempting to pierce into his head telepathically. He cocks his head to the side, wondering whether he should call out to her, though he doesn\u2019t even know her first name. Just as he\u2019s debating what to do, she ducks backwards, out of sight, and the moment is snatched away. </p><p>When Dan gets into the office, Phil is leaned up against Mona\u2019s desk like some hip CEO with an \u2018open door policy\u2019 for his office full of workers. He looks weary, which Dan supposes isn\u2019t so surprising, given that he happens to know Phil got a lot less sleep than usual last night, but there\u2019s something underneath it too. A bone-deep exhaustion, so intense that it radiates off him in waves. </p><p>\u201cNikolai\u2019s coming,\u201d Phil says without preamble. Dan\u2019s only just clicked the door shut behind him. He blinks at Phil slowly, a dread creeping over his body from toe to neck. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then feels dumb for not having a better response to hand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Long fingers carve narrow valleys through jet black hair. \u201cApparently someone tipped off the media that Nik and I are definitely breaking it off.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI mean, I thought I already made that pretty obvious at the charity event. Someone had new information though, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who could possibly have any new information?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy guess is one of the vapid yuppies Nikolai has trailing around him 24-7,\u201d Phil replies with a sniff. \u201cMaybe one of them overheard when I called him yesterday. Decided to make a quick buck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Nikolai\u2019s coming here why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been able to contact me about all the new stories flying about, so he got in touch with Martyn, figuring he\u2019d be able to snag my attention,\u201d Phil says, sounding bitter.\u00a0\u201cMartyn listened to Nik ranting about my radio silence for roughly thirty seconds and then hopped on a plane to warn me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, why hasn\u2019t Nik been able to contact you?\u201d Dan asks, too sharpened from nerves to care about the details.\u00a0\u201cI thought he was texting you constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, he was.\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes, which have been glazed, staring into the near distance, refocus on Dan. The corner of his mouth twitches, and one of his sleek, dark eyebrows arches upwards. \u201cAnd then I suddenly became somewhat preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then trips over what seems to be his own foot. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s little amused smile is not as laser-focused on Dan as he\u2019s grown accustomed. Dan gets the distinct feeling that whilst Phil is still all too happy to have a chuckle over his idiocy, his conscious brain is somewhere else. It\u2019s kind of unpleasant to suddenly have the spotlight whisked off him, after having been the sole focus of Phil\u2019s attention for so long. He kind of wants to snap his fingers in front of those blue eyes and bring him back into the room.<br></p><p>\u201cNik likes to be the centre of a scandal, but only when he\u2019s in control of it,\u201d Phil muses, arms folding across his chest. He\u2019s silent for a moment, and Dan can practically see the wheels turning in his brain. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something else, too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dan\u2019s heart picks up its pace. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rumour, apparently, that I have\u2026 someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike, someone that\u2019s making me want to leave my husband.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s breathing stalls. He feels Mona\u2019s floor cracking beneath his feet. \u201cSurely people can\u2019t know about-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how,\u201d Phil says, running a hand through his hair again. It seems to be an unconscious action, whenever he feels stressed. \u201cBut we should probably be careful.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Careful</i>?\u201d Dan repeats, astounded. \u201cYou mean like subtly beckoning me in here to talk in private, right in front of brand new guests? And Kaspar?\u201d Phil gives him a look, but Dan can feel himself getting worked up. If he stays in this small room with Phil for much longer, he\u2019s going to boil over and say something he regrets. \u201cI-I have to get out of here-\u201d</p><p>Behind him, the latch of the door twitches before he so much as moves a muscle. Dan knows this because he\u2019s leant against it; the wooden lever is digging into the small of his back. He locks eyes with Phil, alarmed, and witnesses what he imagines is reflection of his own fear painting Phil\u2019s face. The latch lifts properly this time, and the door pushes against Dan, but he uses all his weight to prevent it opening. </p><p>He mouths <i>\u2018help me\u2019</i> to Phil, who jumps to action at once, coming to assist Dan as he holds the door closed. From the other side, Mona\u2019s voice calls, \u201cwho\u2019s in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Dan hisses under his breath. The door rattles; she\u2019s growing impatient. </p><p>Phil is staring searching Dan\u2019s face for some kind of plan. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Mona,\u201d Phil calls out. Dan gapes at him. Surely he cannot be about to reveal that the two of them are in here, alone, seconds after telling Dan they need to keep their shit on the DL. \u201cMy brother and I needed the office again. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause. The door stops rattling. \u201cWhy is the door locked?\u201d </p><p>Dan presses his mouth together, trying not to breathe too loudly, in case Mona could recognise the air rushing from his lungs. Phil looks skyward, grasping for a response. \u201cWe, uh, didn\u2019t want to be disturbed. It\u2019s a serious, uh, matter we\u2019re discussing. Could you just give us five more minutes, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Novokoric, I really need to get to my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Phil begs, then squeezes his eyes shut. </p><p>Dan bites his lip, praying. Eventually, Mona says, \u201cfine. But after that, you\u2019ll have to find somewhere else to go. Like your suite, perhaps. Or Mr Lester\u2019s perfectly adequate room.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, shooting Dan a look of relief. \u201cThanks, Mona.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFive minutes!\u201d </p><p>The sound of her kitten heels click-clacking away are like music to Dan\u2019s ears. He blows out a huge puff of air, slumping against the door. \u201cFuck, that was close. No idea how we\u2019d have explained that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we weren\u2019t even doing anything fun to explain away,\u201d Phil says regretfully,\u00a0aiming a half-smile at Dan.</p><p>He tries not to return it, but fails spectacularly. \u201cI should go,\u201d Dan says, partly because he can sense this conversation heading into dangerous territory, and what they absolutely do not need is for Mona to come back in five minutes and walk in on something even worse. \u201cLet me out first, you follow in a minute or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Dan,\u201d Phil says, grabbing hold of his arm. He lets go pretty fast, but it was a telling move. Dan stops, waiting to hear him out. \u201cI- I know this is all\u2026 not ideal. I didn\u2019t know Martyn was coming, and obviously the timing is pretty crap what with everything that happened last night\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan blushes, looking away. \u201cThat\u2019s family for you, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with Nik coming, I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll next get a chance to\u2026\u201d Phil trails off, and Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. Phil laughs at his expression. \u201cTo be alone. To talk. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYeah, I guess that wouldn\u2019t be wise whilst they\u2019re all\u2026 watching.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Phil says, leaning back on his hands. His cheeks are vaguely stained with magenta. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>A beam of clear, glossy light pierces Dan\u2019s mind, softening his pounding heart. He recognises this half-conversation. Phil is asking for something, without using real words. A tiny smile playing on his mouth, Dan steps in front of him, takes his dumb, emotionally stunted face in both hands, and kisses him, soft and slow. He only lets it last a moment, just long enough for the taste of Phil\u2019s tongue to seep through, so Dan can remember it. </p><p>He leans back, and says, \u201ccatch you later. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, eyes flicking towards the ceiling for a moment before landing back on Dan. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says quietly, then moves away from the door so Dan can open it. As he steps through, back into the lobby, Dan turns for a final look. Phil\u2019s watching him with a worried expression, though he does give Dan a tiny wave. \u201cGo do some work,\u201d he says gruffly, then turns back into the office, breaking their gaze. </p><p>*</p><p>Not even fifteen minutes after exiting Mona\u2019s office, Dan\u2019s dragging Ms Stone\u2019s and Ms Harris\u2019 cases up the stairs when he hears a sound he vividly remembers being traumatised by at an earlier date. The fact that he knows the deafening rumble from overhead is not an earthquake or avalanche does not make it any less chilling. Dan stops mid-flight of stairs and cranes his neck upwards, as if he could see through the roof of the hotel, then pierce through the steel of the plane into the cabin where Nikolai Novokoric is no doubt lounging in a reclining seat, sipping champagne. </p><p>He listens to the plane swoop low, then hit the tarmac, the engine stuttering, then cutting out entirely. With a desperate sigh, Dan continues his climb to the second floor, bags in tow. </p><p>*</p><p>Nikolai\u2019s shrill, grating voice echoes off the wooden walls of the hotel from the moment he walks through the door. A shudder runs through Dan\u2019s body as he hears those first few notes of posh, slightly Swiss bolstering. To escape, he goes to clean room two, the Fitzgerald\u2019s room, whilst they\u2019re out on a hike with Kaspar. They hadn\u2019t been enthusiastic to go, but as they\u2019re on an all expenses paid for trip, they couldn\u2019t exactly argue with Mona when she\u2019d scheduled it for them. </p><p>Dan closes the door behind him, breathing a long sigh. It feels like the first moment he\u2019s been alone in days, although of course that\u2019s not true. The Fitzgerald\u2019s room is a tip, and it\u2019s not all that surprising. Their mini fridge has been gutted, and there are packets of peanuts and mini liquor bottles scattered on every available surface. It\u2019s a family room, with a double bed on one side, and a single bed against the window. The single bed is half-heartedly made, but the double is in complete disarray - the pillows are dumped on the floor and the sheets are stained with what looks like Dorito dust. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected,\u201d Dan mutters to himself. </p><p>He\u2019s just setting to work when he realises that above the mundane cleaning noises, he can still hear Nikolai somewhere downstairs - his loud, boisterous laughter and fake enthusiasm. He needs a distraction, badly, but doesn\u2019t have anything to hand. He supposes he could call his mother back, at last. He hasn\u2019t spoken to her since the day after he arrived at The Secret of the Alps, so he owes her a phone call. He can do it as he works, perhaps that will make it easier to stomach. </p><p>With twitching fingers Dan pulls out his phone and dials his childhood home number, before he can talk himself out of it. She picks up on the third ring. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He swallows, throat tightening. Is it possible that he already regrets phoning her when all she\u2019s said is his name? \u201cHi, Mum.\u201d </p><p>He sets the phone to loudspeaker, and crouches down to begin emptying the overflowing wastepaper bin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in weeks.\u201d</p><p>Wow, straight in with the guilt trip. No point wasting time, he supposes. \u201cNo. Sorry. I\u2019ve been very busy here. Long work days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>The phone crackles. It\u2019s an excruciating sound. To dispel the awkwardness, Dan asks, \u201chow\u2019ve things been?\u201d </p><p>She sighs loudly. \u201cFine, fine. Your father\u2019s had that ear thing again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. He ties the rubbish bag tightly, then sets it by the door. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Hope he gets it sorted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you know what he\u2019s like about seeing doctors. Stubborn old man, just like his son.\u201d</p><p>Dan knows, he <i>knows</i> it\u2019s a provocation, intent on riling him up, but he still falls for it. \u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo listen to your mother, and come home,\u201d his mother says, her voice slipping into the one Dan is so used to, sharp and cold. \u201cI know what\u2019s best for you, Daniel. You\u2019re too young make such a hugely affecting decision. Throwing away your chance at a degree, it\u2019s reckless! You\u2019ll end up with no money, stuck in a low-paying job forever-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t important to me, Mum.\u201d He heads for the double bed, starting to throw pillows onto it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt will be important to you when you run out of it,\u201d his mum replies with a sniff. </p><p>\u201cI have a job,\u201d Dan says slowly, as if drawing out the syllables could help her understand the one thing she\u2019s always failed to. In his hand he clasps a pillow, ready to be screamed into at any moment. \u201cI have savings, and a place to live. I\u2019m getting by just fine. I don\u2019t see what the point is of forcing myself to toil through a degree in a subject I hate, to secure a job I\u2019ll despise, racking up a load of debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being naiive,\u201d she says, for what must be the hundredth time. Dan sighs, flopping down onto on the floor by the Fitzgeralds\u2019 bed, abandoning all attempt at continuing the clean. \u201cThe world won\u2019t be kind to you if you\u2019re unintelligent and unqualified. What do you suppose you\u2019re going to do with yourself? Change beds in a hotel up God-knows-what-mountain forever? It\u2019s just not realistic-\u201d</p><p>Dan looks at the pillow he\u2019s still holding, wondering if she\u2019s somehow able to sense that he\u2019s doing exactly that. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I would be doing this forever.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s arms wrap around the pillow, miserably. He\u2019s trembling slightly, because he detests so much as thinking about his future given that it\u2019s so uncertain. He\u2019s here now, for the foreseeable weeks ahead, and that\u2019s some stability at least. He curls his fingers into the pillow\u2019s soft material, trying to breathe through the anxiety attack he can feel brewing. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late for you to come back, you know,\u201d his mum says; her voice is kinder now, the edges softened. It would be so easy to fall into the trap of her mumsy words, to run back down the mountain into her arms. She\u2019d waste no time in calling up the University and re-enrolling him in his awful law degree, then locking him straight back into his prison-cell dorm room. \u201cYour dad and I would sort it all out for you,\u201d she says, like she can read his mind,\u00a0\u201cit hasn\u2019t been too long, we could talk to people, chalk this up to a minor blip in judgement.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Dan mouths some things he wants to say, but won\u2019t. <i>Why can\u2019t you try to understand me properly? Why don\u2019t my opinions matter just because I\u2019m young? Why would I want to be a lawyer, miserable in my office for the next fifty years just like Dad\u2019s been, living for the weekend like that\u2019s the way life\u2019s supposed to be lived?</i></p><p>\u201cYou know, I saw on Facebook that Beth is still single,\u201d his mum says in a hesitant voice, and that\u2019s the moment Dan decides the catch-up is over. </p><p>\u201cI have to go, mum,\u201d Dan says, proud that his voice cracks only a small amount as he reaches for the phone. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of my shift.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, Dan,\u201d his mum says quickly, and something about the urgency of her voice makes him listen. His thumb hovers over the red \u2018end call\u2019 button. \u201cI\u2026 had Vanessa and Darren round for lunch yesterday. They were talking about some scandal that\u2019s been in the news. About that young heir of the Swiss Royal family. The gay one, you know.\u201d</p><p>Icy fingers wrap around Dan\u2019s heart. He reminds himself to remain calm, that there\u2019s no way she could possibly know he has any involvement. \u201cHe\u2019s bisexual, actually,\u201d Dan corrects in a mock-casual voice. \u201cVanessa and Darren had fascinating insights into the situation I\u2019m sure, but Mum, I really have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anything of it at first,\u201d his mum continues, like Dan hadn\u2019t spoken. There\u2019s something wrong with her voice. It\u2019s too shrill, too forced. \u201cBut I was thinking it over later, and I realised I <i>knew</i> the place this Sir Nicholas\u2019 husband is rumoured to be. It\u2019s the same mountain you told me your hotel is on.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes flutter closed. This surely can<i>not</i> be happening. His mother barely remembers his birthday, let alone the specific mountain in the vast range of the Alps he decided to run off to. </p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dan says, because anything else would be too incriminating. </p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d his mother says in a small, strangled voice. \u201cOh, God, it\u2019s you darling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s me?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes squeeze together; but even as he wishes for anything else, he knows she\u2019s guessed the truth. Her shame is like poison, seeping out of the phone into his ear, plucking Dan\u2019s worst anxieties from their dark corners.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI always knew there was something you were keeping from me,\u201d she half-wails in a soft, crackly voice. \u201cSome reason you tucked away inside that you felt made you- you <i>different</i> from everyone else. Oh Dan, honey, this is so not the way to deal with it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it when I had the thought, but I went back through those texts you sent me when you first arrived,\u201d his mum says in a rush. \u201cAbout the famous guest who you didn\u2019t get along with, how you were dreading spending so much time alone with him. It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it, Dan? It\u2019s the one they\u2019re all saying is- is- cheating. With a waiter.\u201d </p><p>Dan lets the disdain in her voice slip through his skin, burrow into his well of shame that\u2019s already deep and bubbling.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond for a while, weighing up all the things he could try and say to dissuade her, to convince her that she\u2019s wrong. Instead, wearied by even the thought of exerting himself to insist such a lie is true, he just corrects her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a concierge, not a waiter.\u201d His mum lets out a sort of sob-noise. \u201cMum,\u201d Dan says quickly, frightened by her reaction suddenly, \u201cyou can\u2019t tell anyone. Mum, do you understand?\u201d </p><p>She breathes thickly. \u201cOh, God, Dan, this is- why did you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned it,\u201d Dan says, feeling his hackles rise. \u201cThis is so typical of you, Mum, judging me from afar, all my choices and decisions when you have no idea about any of it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain this to me!\u201d she cries, still unbearably shrill. \u201cIs this as bright of a decision as dropping out of university, or breaking up with your lovely girlfriend, or running away to scrub toilets up a mountain?! What on earth are you thinking, you daft-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him!\u201d Dan interrupts, the words surging out of him like vomit. His eyes widen as soon as they\u2019re out, as if he can see them hanging in the air before him, hovering like flies above the Fitzgeralds\u2019 bag of trash. \u201cI- I mean, I care about him. I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know why I said- forget that. But I do care. His marriage is toxic, Mum. If you knew the truth, if the rest of the world knew - if Vanessa and Derren knew what Nikolai was <i>like</i>-\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d his mum asks, weakly. \u201cThey\u2019d fall in love with him, too?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan leaves the Fitzgeralds room without finishing the clean; his conversation with his mother has left him too agitated to focus on something so mundane. He remembers now - too late, of course - why he\u2019s been so reluctant to call her back. He had not left home on good terms with his parents - his father refused to even say goodbye. They\u2019ve always been hideously conservative in their views, so Dan with his liberal politics and marginally effeminate\u00a0\u2018emo\u2019 dress sense growing up had never really been their idea of the perfect son.\u00a0</p><p>Through school he\u2019d rebelled against them, which only made everyone unhappy, so once he was older, he tried the opposite - to do what they wanted, to conform to their ideals of being a straight, cisgender young version of his father, on track to be a lawyer. But this was never good enough for them either, probably because it made Dan so miserable that he never truly gave it all he\u2019d got. It\u2019s always seemed to Dan that nothing he did would ever quite please them, so he\u2019d run off instead, done the thing he knew would upset them and said\u00a0\u2018fuck the consequences\u2019. There\u2019s no point trying to explain his actions to either of them - not that his father would so much as speak to him, probably - because Dan doesn\u2019t have answers or reasons for his actions right now, and that\u2019s not what they want to hear.\u00a0</p><p>To distract himself from the thousands of pounding, unpleasant thoughts rampaging through his mind, Dan heads for the stairs, intending to try and creep through the mezzanine without being seen. At a furtive glance, Dan sees the lounge area is rammed with people, some of which are spilling out onto the balcony, through the doors that have been opened. The sleet storm is dying down, but it\u2019s not completely over, meaning that some speckles of icy water are flying in. </p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t know for sure of course, but he highly doubts that Mona would have been the one to allow this, so it\u2019s probably a Nikolai-request. He\u2019s almost across the room, at the top of the stairs leading down to the lobby, when Mona spots him. </p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d she near-shrieks, sounding seconds away from an even wilder tone of voice. \u201cDan, could you come here, please? Now?\u201d</p><p>Suppressing a loud scream, Dan fixes a wobbly smile in place, and heads towards her. He notes that every single chair is occupied - people have pulled out beanbag chairs, trunks and stools, and crammed around the scatter of tables. It\u2019s unnerving to see the room so teeming with bodies when it\u2019s usually empty enough that Dan could dance through it in his underwear (provided Louise didn\u2019t choose the wrong moment to look through the serving hatch). </p><p>Some of the people are familiar to Dan and some are new to him. Most of the people he doesn\u2019t recognise are huddled together in matching slate grey suits, or grouped around enormous cameras, microphones in their hands. The Fitzgeralds have managed to snag their own table in the midst of it all, looking far too excited (minus their daughter, who is plugged into her iPhone, looking extremely like Dan at that age whenever he was forcibly taken to a social situation he didn\u2019t want to be at). The Fitzgeralds are talking animatedly at Max the security man, who has squished all of his beefy, six-foot-two frame into a beanbag, arms folded, staring stoically ahead.\u00a0</p><p>Ms Stone and Ms Harris are here as well, sipping tea and looking mildly alarmed - but interested - at their unusual surroundings. Dan also spots Cornelia in the corner by the TV, talking into a mobile phone and looking decidedly unhappy about something Dan is sure would push anyone except her into crisis mode. Bryony and Hazel are leaning through the serving hatch laughing about something with Louise. PJ is flitting about, stuck to the walls with his camera to his eye, photographing seemingly everything from the sleet stains on the wooden floor to the whiskers decorating Max\u2019s chin. And Nikolai is here, of course, strolling in through the balcony doors in his long stylish coat, brushing sleet from his shoulders like it should have known better than to settle there. </p><p>When he sees Dan, he grins widely, and Dan senses the oncoming hug before it happens. Engulfed in Nikolai\u2019s cold, damp arms, the only thought pumping through Dan\u2019s treacherous mind is, most helpfully,\u00a0<i>your husband fucked my brains out last night</i>.</p><p>He manages not to let this slip off his tongue, mercifully. When Nikolai releases him, he grins again. \u201cMy favourite concierge!\u201d he bellows, slapping Dan on the shoulder. Dan wonders if Louise was right about him instantly forgetting the names of people he doesn\u2019t care about. \u201cI was wondering where you were being kept! Didn\u2019t let the place fall off the cliff then, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d Dan says, managing a weak smile as he surreptitiously rubs his shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t get the chance. Mona took over responsibility before disaster struck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAtta boy,\u201d Nikolai says; his weird accent does not suit the phrase and he seems to know it, judging by the way he clears his throat and claps his hands, distracting attention. \u201cRight everyone, I know we said an outdoor shoot would be preferable, but the weather is against us, so I suggest you set up right here. I\u2019ve been informed that <i>he </i>will be five minutes.\u201d </p><p>Dan badly hopes that the \u2018he\u2019 in question is the abominable snowman, but somehow he doubts it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026doing my best to make sure everyone has a drink and a place to sit, but you\u2019ll need to help me keep an eye\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan realises, belatedly, that he\u2019s been so busy half-glaring at Nikolai\u2019s big, dumb head that he hasn\u2019t been hearing a word Mona is whispering to him. </p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.\u201d Dan leans in a bit closer to her. \u201cAny idea what this is all about?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Mona replies, then darts away from him to where a slate-grey-suit man is beckoning her. </p><p>Dan sighs, scanning the crowd of people for any signs that someone might be in need of further refreshment. Nikolai has, thankfully, gone over to talk to Cornelia, so Dan is free of further sickening smalltalk with the man. He turns around, hoping to escape and hide in the kitchen so Louise can explain what the fuck is going on, when he bumps straight into Martyn Lester. He looks\u2026 completely different to this morning. His hair is neat and coiffed, he\u2019s wearing a suit and black tie, and he has an earpiece over one ear. </p><p>\u201cAfternoon, Dan,\u201d he says with a wry smile. \u201cHaving fun at the party?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe host isn\u2019t one of my best friends,\u201d Dan says carefully, inclining his head towards Nikolai. It\u2019s a bit of a risky comment, given that this man is Nikolai\u2019s brother in law, but he\u2019s hoping Louise wasn\u2019t fibbing when she claimed Martyn loathed him. </p><p>Martyn follows Dan\u2019s inclination, smile falling away. He looks quickly at the ground. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t blame you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the secret agent get up?\u201d Dan asks, gesturing to Martyn\u2019s new outfit. He\u2019s not sure what it is, but something about Martyn Lester gives of an inherently calming vibe, like he\u2019s radiating the single statement \u2018I have everything under control\u2019. Perhaps it\u2019s an older brother thing. Or, more likely, it\u2019s because he vaguely resembles Phil with his confident stance, and exhausted-yet-amused-by-everyone\u2019s-ignorance air. \u201cYou planning on taking him out?\u201d </p><p>Martyn sucks in a breath through his teeth. \u201cWouldn\u2019t say that too loud. Max has the ears of a Silverwing and the biceps of a Silverback.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at him blankly. </p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s a bat, one\u2019s a gorilla,\u201d Martyn explains. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, \u201cI, uh, dropped out of uni.\u201d </p><p>Martyn looks at him strangely. \u201cAre you blaming your abandoned law degree for not knowing your species\u2019 of animals by heart?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, no, I-\u201d Dan breaks off, replaying the question in confusion. \u201cHow did you know it was a law degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, attention everyone,\u201d Nikolai booms, striding into the centre of the room, whipping his coat off as he goes. He tosses the garment in seemingly no particular direction and Hazel lunges forwards to catch it before it hits the ground. Nikolai doesn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cMy soon to be ex-husband has finally decided to emerge from his lair, so we\u2019ll start the interview in one minute, then move on to photos, then\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan stops listening, too intent on scanning the room for Phil. He spots him at the edge of the crowd, arms folded, looking perfect and polished - an action figure intent on some actual action, but being forced to remain pretty and dust-free, displayed on a shelf. </p><p>Martyn leaves Dan\u2019s side with a murmured excuse, at once heading to stand with his brother. Across the room, Dan notices Cornelia notice Phil\u2019s appearance as well, and take a step in his direction, but upon seeing Martyn, she stops dead in her tracks, eyes wide and round, then turns abruptly away again. Dan frowns at the peculiar behaviour he\u2019s just witnessed, vaguely recalling something Louise mentioned about she and Martyn having to argue out publicist-related drama between Phil and Nikolai a great deal when Martyn still worked for Phil.</p><p>At present, Martyn looks a lot like he still does work for Phil; he\u2019s currently steering Phil into the centre of the room, pushing quite firmly as he obviously doesn\u2019t want to move. Dan tries to catch Phil\u2019s eye, to smile sympathetically, but Phil won\u2019t look at him. He notes that Phil is wearing a tightly knotted scarf-thing around his throat, which was smart of him. Dan knows far too well that the hickey that scarf hides is, as of last night, just as vibrant as ever. </p><p>Martyn stands Phil on a small wooden crate that\u2019s been put out, and Nikolai hops deftly up onto another at his side, unfazed. Everything about Phil\u2019s body language screams discomfort, only growing worse with all the eyes on him. Along with the pang of sympathy that surges up in Dan\u2019s chest, swoops the echo of what his mum said earlier - what <i>Dan</i> had said earlier even - how that\u00a0\u2018L\u2019 word had just slipped out. Effortless, like it had been poised on the tip of his tongue for days.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s never used that word for anyone outside of family before, not even Beth. It must have been an accidental slip-up, born of a desperate desire not to let his mum win the argument, but how bizarre that it chose now to make a random appearance. He cannot possibly have fallen for Phil of all people, the man who consistently infuriates and aggravates him, who has a husband that would feel no remorse if he stepped on Dan\u2019s face on his way out of the building. To fall in love - even the <i>word </i>is terrifying - with anyone, let alone the person he should resist developing any feelings for whatsoever, is not comprehensible. He refuses to so much as dare to believe it.\u00a0</p><p>Even so, Dan wouldn\u2019t wish this kind of horrible, judgemental scrutiny on anyone, let alone Phil (who he does, admittedly, care for - he wasn\u2019t lying about that).</p><p>Martyn nods at Phil seriously, telling him something with those matching blue eyes alone, and then steps aside. Nikolai glances at Phil, who doesn\u2019t look back, and sighs. \u201cOkay. First question.\u201d </p><p>Hands shoot up; there are four reporters as far as Dan can see - each with their own mini team of tech crew. The first is a woman in a bright red blazer, who Nikolai gestures to with a silky wave of his hand. </p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai, how are you feeling in the wake of your husband\u2019s desire to divorce?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDevastated, of course,\u201d Nikolai says sombrely, hands clasped at his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to give Philip all he could ever wish for, but evidently, that was not enough.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s hands curl into fists; he looks at Phil, wondering what he\u2019ll add, but he\u2019s just staring at the floor, lips thin and tight. Nikolai gestures to the next reporter, an attractive, honey-haired woman with dark lipstick and a darker fitted blazer tight on her skinny waist. </p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai,\u201d she says in a low voice, ducking her head in a small bow, \u201cwould you address the recent rumours of your husband\u2019s adultery?</p><p>Nikolai laughs, straightening his tie. \u201cNo more than idle gossip sold for a price,\u201d he says airily; Dan tries to keep very still, but he gets the sense that several people are watching him closely. Probably Louise, for one. Nikolai laughs again in a long trill. \u201cFor starters, who on Earth would he be cheating with up here-\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s loosening his scarf, drawing Nikolai\u2019s attention, making him break off before the sentence ends. It\u2019s a subtle move, barely noticeable to anyone else, but Dan catches it. Nikolai pauses, zeroing in on something that Dan can\u2019t see, that nobody can see except him, standing right beside Phil, but that Dan can easily guess at.\u00a0</p><p>What the fuck is Phil playing at? Dan wonders, heartbeat pounding in his ears. It\u2019s almost like he <i>wants</i> Nikolai to see- Oh. </p><p>In a flash, Dan understands. He does want Nikolai to see the bruise. He wants him to know that the media had been right, there is a \u2018someone\u2019. Phil wants to hurt him. Nikolai is still not saying anything. There\u2019s a shadow passing over his sharp, handsome features. And then, in the next instant, it\u2019s vanished, flicked away out of the balcony doors, his easy, carefully morose expression back in position. Dan lets out a sigh of relief, quietly. Phil re-knots the scarf. </p><p>Nikolai gestures to a man with a dark widow\u2019s peak cutting a severe expression into his forehead.\u00a0\u201cNext question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai, it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d the man says in a deep, slimy voice; Dan likens it to gooey, dark molasses. \u201cWhat prompted the sudden split?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wish I could tell you,\u201d Nikolai says with a sad smile. He looks at Phil, who is still staring straight down at the ground, and heaves a long-suffering sigh. \u201cBut alas, Philip is the only one who could answer that question. I\u2019m still very much in love.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, the sound loud and obvious in the hushed room. He brings his hand to his mouth, immediately feigning a coughing fit. As he\u2019s spluttering, he snags Cornelia\u2019s eye across the room; she\u2019s laughing silently at him. </p><p>\u201cYes, my question is for Philip?\u201d the large, bespectacled lady Nikolai has waved to says, peering over her glasses at Phil. Phil doesn\u2019t move, but Dan senses a collective intake of breath shudder through the room, which is then held in thirty or so sets of lungs. \u201cHow has your marriage to Nikolai been?\u201d </p><p>Slowly, Phil lifts his head. He stares the lady full in the face; there\u2019s no mistaking the white hot fury in his eyes now that they\u2019re visible. \u201cGo to hell,\u201d he spits out. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll experience it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>A moment of shocked silence stretches, elastic and loaded, and then it snaps, the room erupting into noise. The reporters abandon Nikolai\u2019s \u2018hands up\u2019 system and start angrily yelling their questions, shouting over each other as chairs scrape backwards and Nikolai\u2019s various staff members jump up to keep everything under control. The most angry of the lot is the reporter Phil told to go to hell, perhaps understandably, and she charges towards the makeshift podiums, only to trip on her way and launch forwards into Nikolai\u2019s legs. </p><p>Nikolai stumbles and falls backwards, landing directly on his ass on the wooden floor behind. Shrieks of distress echo through the room, most of them coming from Mrs Fitzgerald, and seemingly everybody rushes to help Nikolai up, except Dan and Phil, who both stand rigidly in the midst of the commotion, turning to lock eyes across people\u2019s bobbing heads. </p><p>Finally, Dan is able to send him that sympathetic smile, but Phil just looks desperately miserable, and doesn\u2019t manage to return it. So instead, Dan mouths \u2018you fucked that up\u2019. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches then, just a tad, but still enough for Dan to know he got through. Warm, syrupy pride courses through Dan\u2019s veins, just from knowing he\u2019s able to make Phil feel even a tiny bit better in such a horrendous situation. Phil turns to watch Nikolai being dusted off for a moment, and as he looks away, Dan realises what the sweet, soft, melted-butter-on-toast feeling consuming him must be. He <i>loves</i> this pompous idiot with a fuse shorter than most matches.</p><p>Phil fixes that gellid blue gaze back on him and rolls his eyes in regard to Nikolai\u2019s theatrics. And right then, in that moment Dan knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that he\u2019s completely, Royally fucked.\u00a0</p><p><b>(<a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/185111534550/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eighteen!</a>)</b></p>",

The Secret of the Alps, a small hotel tucked into the side of the Swiss mountains is too niche for most avid adventurers to have heard of, making it the perfect place for Dan to work as he sorts through his problems. Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br>Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183801485578/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Ten</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183968016711/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eleven</a><br><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184138802035/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Twelve</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184301494045/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Thirteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184463426719/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fourteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184632676790/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fifteen</a><br></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184786820304/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Sixteen</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Seventeen</b></p><p>The Fitzgeralds want omelettes for breakfast. But not just one each, Dan learns, when the two adults clean their plates and tell him, patting tummies and grinning, that they\u2019re ready for round two. He\u2019s not sure where the youngest member of their party is hiding, but Dan doesn\u2019t blame her for passing up on watching her parents shovel eggs into their gawping mouths like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Dan has the unfortunate job of telling Louise that she\u2019s expected to fry up unlimited omelettes until the two older Fitzgeralds are completely satisfied. When she smacks him with a yolky wooden spoon, Dan can\u2019t say he blames her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so violent when you\u2019re mad,\u201d Dan complains, dabbing at the yellowish stain on his shirt sleeve. </p><p>Louise shoots him a glare, whisking eggs vigorously in a bowl. \u201cI have good reason to do a lot worse, so I\u2019d scarper if I were you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything worse than what Nikolai is doing to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think that\u2019s a viable excuse, I\u2019m going to chop you up and feed you to the Fitzgeralds in their next omelette.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Dan sighs, folding his arms and feeling a lot like a petulant child. \u201cAgree to disagree, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, you cannot fight fire with fire. Nikolai is a powerful man. He\u2019s going to steam roller over you without a second thought if he catches wind of what you\u2019re up to with his man.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, he won\u2019t catch wind. Our wind is thousands of miles away from anyone up here.\u201d That hadn\u2019t come out quite right, Dan thinks, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cNot from everyone,\u201d Louise rightly points out, grinding pepper into the bowl. </p><p>An image of Martyn Lester\u2019s exasperated face flashes into Dan\u2019s mind, and he chews his lip, wondering if he and Phil are anywhere near done chatting yet. They still haven\u2019t left Mona\u2019s office, and it\u2019s been over half an hour. Mona\u2019s going beserk, muttering about etiquette and rudeness, scrubbing tables and dusting corners because she can\u2019t get to her desk. Dan can see her through the serving hatch, polishing the huge balcony windows with irritable vigour.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about Martyn Lester?\u201d Dan asks in an attempt at nonchalance.</p><p>Louise\u2019s lips press together, and she pours some of the egg mixture into the pan. It sizzles pleasantly, immediately beginning to bubble and release a fragrant, delicious aroma. Dan\u2019s stomach rumbles; he hasn\u2019t eaten anything today - too busy sorting out the miraculous appearance of Phil\u2019s sibling. </p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She pauses, prodding at the slowly solidifying omelette with a spatula. \u201cWe used to be pals, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, he quit being Phil\u2019s publicist. Pretty abruptly. Just up and left. I haven\u2019t seen him since he walked out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, brows knitting together. The anger in Louise\u2019s voice is unmistakable, but Dan senses he shouldn\u2019t press the still-sore wound. \u201cDo you know why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI imagine there\u2019s more to it than just this, but he was never Nikolai\u2019s biggest fan,\u201d Louise says, then deftly flips the omelette. \u201cHe told me that the only reason he ever became Phil\u2019s publicist was to prevent Phil from getting fucked by the guy.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, reflecting on her words; her eyes meet Dan\u2019s, and they both snort with laughter. </p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she says, \u201cMartyn\u2019s a protective older brother type. He and Nikolai did a lot of butting heads.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of hard to butt heads with someone who\u2019s never around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s another reason Martyn got so frustrated,\u201d Louise says, shifting omelettes onto plates with swift, practiced movements. \u201cIt was always Cornelia he\u2019d have to argue it out with.\u201d Louise looks at Dan as she shoves plates into his hands. \u201cYou met her, right? The fiery redhead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. She seemed cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t know much more than that, but if he\u2019s here after having quit so dramatically, I\u2019d say it\u2019s doubtful that he brings good tidings.\u201d Louise gives him a \u2018well?\u2019 look, gesturing to the plates in his hands. \u201cOff you go, then.\u201d</p><p>Awash with new information, Dan then turns to the door of the kitchen, and heads out to deliver the Fitzgeralds their second serving. </p><p>*</p><p>It\u2019s two in the afternoon, and Phil is avoiding him. There\u2019s no definitive evidence of this, but Dan\u2019s ninety-nine percent sure. He\u2019s been glimpsing Phil all day, through the window in the door of the gym as he works out, hurrying through the lobby in damp clothes, sat at a table in deep conversation with Martyn, but he hasn\u2019t so much as caught Dan\u2019s eye. It\u2019s pissing Dan off to no end, though he\u2019s trying to make excuses for him as his brother\u2019s sudden appearance could mean all sorts of things.\u00a0</p><p>Still, he feels like grabbing Phil by the shoulders and spinning him round so that they\u2019re forced to lock eyes, then telling him <i>\u2018hey, dickhead, you were inside of me last night, the least you can do is nod in my direction, even if you have to wait until Martyn is looking the other way\u2019</i>. </p><p>Dan\u2019s at the front desk, checking in the new couple that have just arrived with Kaspar in tow: Ms Stone and Ms Harris. They\u2019re both in their seventies, and Ms Stone is in a wheelchair, so it\u2019s pretty impressive that they\u2019ve made it up here at all, but they\u2019re perfectly chipper, papery, ungloved hands tightly clasped. Dan hands over their room key, and just as Kaspar is jerking Ms Stone backwards and spinning her, rather alarmingly fast, in the direction of their wheelchair lift, Phil appears from nowhere, at the side of the desk, bright eyes screaming \u2018we need to talk\u2019. </p><p>He says a polite \u201chello\u201d to Kaspar, who bellows an enthusiastic response that makes excessive use of the word \u2018Philly\u2019. Then, seeming not to be able to contain his urgency, Phil turns to Dan, inclining his head towards Mona\u2019s office.</p><p>Dan nods at him, a little annoyed that he\u2019s being so obvious in front of people, but telling himself Phil must have a reason. Phil slinks off, and Dan turns back to Ms Stone and Ms Harris to tell them that he\u2019ll be up shortly to deliver their bags. Just as they\u2019re disappearing from view, Dan\u2019s preparing to creep round to the office when he senses eyes on him. He looks about, searching for the source of the prickling sensation that\u2019s grazing the back of his neck. At the last second, he looks upwards; peering over the edge of the mezzanine rail is the Fitzgerald\u2019s teenage daughter, her blue strands of hair dangling over the wood. </p><p>She\u2019s looking directly at him, her stare wide and unfaltering, like she\u2019s attempting to pierce into his head telepathically. He cocks his head to the side, wondering whether he should call out to her, though he doesn\u2019t even know her first name. Just as he\u2019s debating what to do, she ducks backwards, out of sight, and the moment is snatched away. </p><p>When Dan gets into the office, Phil is leaned up against Mona\u2019s desk like some hip CEO with an \u2018open door policy\u2019 for his office full of workers. He looks weary, which Dan supposes isn\u2019t so surprising, given that he happens to know Phil got a lot less sleep than usual last night, but there\u2019s something underneath it too. A bone-deep exhaustion, so intense that it radiates off him in waves. </p><p>\u201cNikolai\u2019s coming,\u201d Phil says without preamble. Dan\u2019s only just clicked the door shut behind him. He blinks at Phil slowly, a dread creeping over his body from toe to neck. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then feels dumb for not having a better response to hand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Long fingers carve narrow valleys through jet black hair. \u201cApparently someone tipped off the media that Nik and I are definitely breaking it off.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI mean, I thought I already made that pretty obvious at the charity event. Someone had new information though, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who could possibly have any new information?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy guess is one of the vapid yuppies Nikolai has trailing around him 24-7,\u201d Phil replies with a sniff. \u201cMaybe one of them overheard when I called him yesterday. Decided to make a quick buck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Nikolai\u2019s coming here why?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been able to contact me about all the new stories flying about, so he got in touch with Martyn, figuring he\u2019d be able to snag my attention,\u201d Phil says, sounding bitter.\u00a0\u201cMartyn listened to Nik ranting about my radio silence for roughly thirty seconds and then hopped on a plane to warn me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, why hasn\u2019t Nik been able to contact you?\u201d Dan asks, too sharpened from nerves to care about the details.\u00a0\u201cI thought he was texting you constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, he was.\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes, which have been glazed, staring into the near distance, refocus on Dan. The corner of his mouth twitches, and one of his sleek, dark eyebrows arches upwards. \u201cAnd then I suddenly became somewhat preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, then trips over what seems to be his own foot. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s little amused smile is not as laser-focused on Dan as he\u2019s grown accustomed. Dan gets the distinct feeling that whilst Phil is still all too happy to have a chuckle over his idiocy, his conscious brain is somewhere else. It\u2019s kind of unpleasant to suddenly have the spotlight whisked off him, after having been the sole focus of Phil\u2019s attention for so long. He kind of wants to snap his fingers in front of those blue eyes and bring him back into the room.<br></p><p>\u201cNik likes to be the centre of a scandal, but only when he\u2019s in control of it,\u201d Phil muses, arms folding across his chest. He\u2019s silent for a moment, and Dan can practically see the wheels turning in his brain. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 something else, too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dan\u2019s heart picks up its pace. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rumour, apparently, that I have\u2026 someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike, someone that\u2019s making me want to leave my husband.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s breathing stalls. He feels Mona\u2019s floor cracking beneath his feet. \u201cSurely people can\u2019t know about-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how,\u201d Phil says, running a hand through his hair again. It seems to be an unconscious action, whenever he feels stressed. \u201cBut we should probably be careful.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Careful</i>?\u201d Dan repeats, astounded. \u201cYou mean like subtly beckoning me in here to talk in private, right in front of brand new guests? And Kaspar?\u201d Phil gives him a look, but Dan can feel himself getting worked up. If he stays in this small room with Phil for much longer, he\u2019s going to boil over and say something he regrets. \u201cI-I have to get out of here-\u201d</p><p>Behind him, the latch of the door twitches before he so much as moves a muscle. Dan knows this because he\u2019s leant against it; the wooden lever is digging into the small of his back. He locks eyes with Phil, alarmed, and witnesses what he imagines is reflection of his own fear painting Phil\u2019s face. The latch lifts properly this time, and the door pushes against Dan, but he uses all his weight to prevent it opening. </p><p>He mouths <i>\u2018help me\u2019</i> to Phil, who jumps to action at once, coming to assist Dan as he holds the door closed. From the other side, Mona\u2019s voice calls, \u201cwho\u2019s in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Dan hisses under his breath. The door rattles; she\u2019s growing impatient. </p><p>Phil is staring searching Dan\u2019s face for some kind of plan. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Mona,\u201d Phil calls out. Dan gapes at him. Surely he cannot be about to reveal that the two of them are in here, alone, seconds after telling Dan they need to keep their shit on the DL. \u201cMy brother and I needed the office again. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause. The door stops rattling. \u201cWhy is the door locked?\u201d </p><p>Dan presses his mouth together, trying not to breathe too loudly, in case Mona could recognise the air rushing from his lungs. Phil looks skyward, grasping for a response. \u201cWe, uh, didn\u2019t want to be disturbed. It\u2019s a serious, uh, matter we\u2019re discussing. Could you just give us five more minutes, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Novokoric, I really need to get to my desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Phil begs, then squeezes his eyes shut. </p><p>Dan bites his lip, praying. Eventually, Mona says, \u201cfine. But after that, you\u2019ll have to find somewhere else to go. Like your suite, perhaps. Or Mr Lester\u2019s perfectly adequate room.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phil says, shooting Dan a look of relief. \u201cThanks, Mona.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFive minutes!\u201d </p><p>The sound of her kitten heels click-clacking away are like music to Dan\u2019s ears. He blows out a huge puff of air, slumping against the door. \u201cFuck, that was close. No idea how we\u2019d have explained that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd we weren\u2019t even doing anything fun to explain away,\u201d Phil says regretfully,\u00a0aiming a half-smile at Dan.</p><p>He tries not to return it, but fails spectacularly. \u201cI should go,\u201d Dan says, partly because he can sense this conversation heading into dangerous territory, and what they absolutely do not need is for Mona to come back in five minutes and walk in on something even worse. \u201cLet me out first, you follow in a minute or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Dan,\u201d Phil says, grabbing hold of his arm. He lets go pretty fast, but it was a telling move. Dan stops, waiting to hear him out. \u201cI- I know this is all\u2026 not ideal. I didn\u2019t know Martyn was coming, and obviously the timing is pretty crap what with everything that happened last night\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan blushes, looking away. \u201cThat\u2019s family for you, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with Nik coming, I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll next get a chance to\u2026\u201d Phil trails off, and Dan\u2019s eyes bulge. Phil laughs at his expression. \u201cTo be alone. To talk. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYeah, I guess that wouldn\u2019t be wise whilst they\u2019re all\u2026 watching.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Phil says, leaning back on his hands. His cheeks are vaguely stained with magenta. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan echoes. </p><p>A beam of clear, glossy light pierces Dan\u2019s mind, softening his pounding heart. He recognises this half-conversation. Phil is asking for something, without using real words. A tiny smile playing on his mouth, Dan steps in front of him, takes his dumb, emotionally stunted face in both hands, and kisses him, soft and slow. He only lets it last a moment, just long enough for the taste of Phil\u2019s tongue to seep through, so Dan can remember it. </p><p>He leans back, and says, \u201ccatch you later. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles, eyes flicking towards the ceiling for a moment before landing back on Dan. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says quietly, then moves away from the door so Dan can open it. As he steps through, back into the lobby, Dan turns for a final look. Phil\u2019s watching him with a worried expression, though he does give Dan a tiny wave. \u201cGo do some work,\u201d he says gruffly, then turns back into the office, breaking their gaze. </p><p>*</p><p>Not even fifteen minutes after exiting Mona\u2019s office, Dan\u2019s dragging Ms Stone\u2019s and Ms Harris\u2019 cases up the stairs when he hears a sound he vividly remembers being traumatised by at an earlier date. The fact that he knows the deafening rumble from overhead is not an earthquake or avalanche does not make it any less chilling. Dan stops mid-flight of stairs and cranes his neck upwards, as if he could see through the roof of the hotel, then pierce through the steel of the plane into the cabin where Nikolai Novokoric is no doubt lounging in a reclining seat, sipping champagne. </p><p>He listens to the plane swoop low, then hit the tarmac, the engine stuttering, then cutting out entirely. With a desperate sigh, Dan continues his climb to the second floor, bags in tow. </p><p>*</p><p>Nikolai\u2019s shrill, grating voice echoes off the wooden walls of the hotel from the moment he walks through the door. A shudder runs through Dan\u2019s body as he hears those first few notes of posh, slightly Swiss bolstering. To escape, he goes to clean room two, the Fitzgerald\u2019s room, whilst they\u2019re out on a hike with Kaspar. They hadn\u2019t been enthusiastic to go, but as they\u2019re on an all expenses paid for trip, they couldn\u2019t exactly argue with Mona when she\u2019d scheduled it for them. </p><p>Dan closes the door behind him, breathing a long sigh. It feels like the first moment he\u2019s been alone in days, although of course that\u2019s not true. The Fitzgerald\u2019s room is a tip, and it\u2019s not all that surprising. Their mini fridge has been gutted, and there are packets of peanuts and mini liquor bottles scattered on every available surface. It\u2019s a family room, with a double bed on one side, and a single bed against the window. The single bed is half-heartedly made, but the double is in complete disarray - the pillows are dumped on the floor and the sheets are stained with what looks like Dorito dust. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected,\u201d Dan mutters to himself. </p><p>He\u2019s just setting to work when he realises that above the mundane cleaning noises, he can still hear Nikolai somewhere downstairs - his loud, boisterous laughter and fake enthusiasm. He needs a distraction, badly, but doesn\u2019t have anything to hand. He supposes he could call his mother back, at last. He hasn\u2019t spoken to her since the day after he arrived at The Secret of the Alps, so he owes her a phone call. He can do it as he works, perhaps that will make it easier to stomach. </p><p>With twitching fingers Dan pulls out his phone and dials his childhood home number, before he can talk himself out of it. She picks up on the third ring. </p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He swallows, throat tightening. Is it possible that he already regrets phoning her when all she\u2019s said is his name? \u201cHi, Mum.\u201d </p><p>He sets the phone to loudspeaker, and crouches down to begin emptying the overflowing wastepaper bin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you in weeks.\u201d</p><p>Wow, straight in with the guilt trip. No point wasting time, he supposes. \u201cNo. Sorry. I\u2019ve been very busy here. Long work days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d </p><p>The phone crackles. It\u2019s an excruciating sound. To dispel the awkwardness, Dan asks, \u201chow\u2019ve things been?\u201d </p><p>She sighs loudly. \u201cFine, fine. Your father\u2019s had that ear thing again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. He ties the rubbish bag tightly, then sets it by the door. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Hope he gets it sorted.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, you know what he\u2019s like about seeing doctors. Stubborn old man, just like his son.\u201d</p><p>Dan knows, he <i>knows</i> it\u2019s a provocation, intent on riling him up, but he still falls for it. \u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo listen to your mother, and come home,\u201d his mother says, her voice slipping into the one Dan is so used to, sharp and cold. \u201cI know what\u2019s best for you, Daniel. You\u2019re too young make such a hugely affecting decision. Throwing away your chance at a degree, it\u2019s reckless! You\u2019ll end up with no money, stuck in a low-paying job forever-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney isn\u2019t important to me, Mum.\u201d He heads for the double bed, starting to throw pillows onto it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt will be important to you when you run out of it,\u201d his mum replies with a sniff. </p><p>\u201cI have a job,\u201d Dan says slowly, as if drawing out the syllables could help her understand the one thing she\u2019s always failed to. In his hand he clasps a pillow, ready to be screamed into at any moment. \u201cI have savings, and a place to live. I\u2019m getting by just fine. I don\u2019t see what the point is of forcing myself to toil through a degree in a subject I hate, to secure a job I\u2019ll despise, racking up a load of debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being naiive,\u201d she says, for what must be the hundredth time. Dan sighs, flopping down onto on the floor by the Fitzgeralds\u2019 bed, abandoning all attempt at continuing the clean. \u201cThe world won\u2019t be kind to you if you\u2019re unintelligent and unqualified. What do you suppose you\u2019re going to do with yourself? Change beds in a hotel up God-knows-what-mountain forever? It\u2019s just not realistic-\u201d</p><p>Dan looks at the pillow he\u2019s still holding, wondering if she\u2019s somehow able to sense that he\u2019s doing exactly that. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I would be doing this forever.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s arms wrap around the pillow, miserably. He\u2019s trembling slightly, because he detests so much as thinking about his future given that it\u2019s so uncertain. He\u2019s here now, for the foreseeable weeks ahead, and that\u2019s some stability at least. He curls his fingers into the pillow\u2019s soft material, trying to breathe through the anxiety attack he can feel brewing. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late for you to come back, you know,\u201d his mum says; her voice is kinder now, the edges softened. It would be so easy to fall into the trap of her mumsy words, to run back down the mountain into her arms. She\u2019d waste no time in calling up the University and re-enrolling him in his awful law degree, then locking him straight back into his prison-cell dorm room. \u201cYour dad and I would sort it all out for you,\u201d she says, like she can read his mind,\u00a0\u201cit hasn\u2019t been too long, we could talk to people, chalk this up to a minor blip in judgement.\u201d </p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Dan mouths some things he wants to say, but won\u2019t. <i>Why can\u2019t you try to understand me properly? Why don\u2019t my opinions matter just because I\u2019m young? Why would I want to be a lawyer, miserable in my office for the next fifty years just like Dad\u2019s been, living for the weekend like that\u2019s the way life\u2019s supposed to be lived?</i></p><p>\u201cYou know, I saw on Facebook that Beth is still single,\u201d his mum says in a hesitant voice, and that\u2019s the moment Dan decides the catch-up is over. </p><p>\u201cI have to go, mum,\u201d Dan says, proud that his voice cracks only a small amount as he reaches for the phone. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of my shift.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, Dan,\u201d his mum says quickly, and something about the urgency of her voice makes him listen. His thumb hovers over the red \u2018end call\u2019 button. \u201cI\u2026 had Vanessa and Darren round for lunch yesterday. They were talking about some scandal that\u2019s been in the news. About that young heir of the Swiss Royal family. The gay one, you know.\u201d</p><p>Icy fingers wrap around Dan\u2019s heart. He reminds himself to remain calm, that there\u2019s no way she could possibly know he has any involvement. \u201cHe\u2019s bisexual, actually,\u201d Dan corrects in a mock-casual voice. \u201cVanessa and Darren had fascinating insights into the situation I\u2019m sure, but Mum, I really have to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think anything of it at first,\u201d his mum continues, like Dan hadn\u2019t spoken. There\u2019s something wrong with her voice. It\u2019s too shrill, too forced. \u201cBut I was thinking it over later, and I realised I <i>knew</i> the place this Sir Nicholas\u2019 husband is rumoured to be. It\u2019s the same mountain you told me your hotel is on.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes flutter closed. This surely can<i>not</i> be happening. His mother barely remembers his birthday, let alone the specific mountain in the vast range of the Alps he decided to run off to. </p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Dan says, because anything else would be too incriminating. </p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d his mother says in a small, strangled voice. \u201cOh, God, it\u2019s you darling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s me?\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes squeeze together; but even as he wishes for anything else, he knows she\u2019s guessed the truth. Her shame is like poison, seeping out of the phone into his ear, plucking Dan\u2019s worst anxieties from their dark corners.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI always knew there was something you were keeping from me,\u201d she half-wails in a soft, crackly voice. \u201cSome reason you tucked away inside that you felt made you- you <i>different</i> from everyone else. Oh Dan, honey, this is so not the way to deal with it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it when I had the thought, but I went back through those texts you sent me when you first arrived,\u201d his mum says in a rush. \u201cAbout the famous guest who you didn\u2019t get along with, how you were dreading spending so much time alone with him. It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it, Dan? It\u2019s the one they\u2019re all saying is- is- cheating. With a waiter.\u201d </p><p>Dan lets the disdain in her voice slip through his skin, burrow into his well of shame that\u2019s already deep and bubbling.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond for a while, weighing up all the things he could try and say to dissuade her, to convince her that she\u2019s wrong. Instead, wearied by even the thought of exerting himself to insist such a lie is true, he just corrects her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a concierge, not a waiter.\u201d His mum lets out a sort of sob-noise. \u201cMum,\u201d Dan says quickly, frightened by her reaction suddenly, \u201cyou can\u2019t tell anyone. Mum, do you understand?\u201d </p><p>She breathes thickly. \u201cOh, God, Dan, this is- why did you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned it,\u201d Dan says, feeling his hackles rise. \u201cThis is so typical of you, Mum, judging me from afar, all my choices and decisions when you have no idea about any of it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain this to me!\u201d she cries, still unbearably shrill. \u201cIs this as bright of a decision as dropping out of university, or breaking up with your lovely girlfriend, or running away to scrub toilets up a mountain?! What on earth are you thinking, you daft-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him!\u201d Dan interrupts, the words surging out of him like vomit. His eyes widen as soon as they\u2019re out, as if he can see them hanging in the air before him, hovering like flies above the Fitzgeralds\u2019 bag of trash. \u201cI- I mean, I care about him. I don\u2019t- I don\u2019t know why I said- forget that. But I do care. His marriage is toxic, Mum. If you knew the truth, if the rest of the world knew - if Vanessa and Derren knew what Nikolai was <i>like</i>-\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d his mum asks, weakly. \u201cThey\u2019d fall in love with him, too?\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan leaves the Fitzgeralds room without finishing the clean; his conversation with his mother has left him too agitated to focus on something so mundane. He remembers now - too late, of course - why he\u2019s been so reluctant to call her back. He had not left home on good terms with his parents - his father refused to even say goodbye. They\u2019ve always been hideously conservative in their views, so Dan with his liberal politics and marginally effeminate\u00a0\u2018emo\u2019 dress sense growing up had never really been their idea of the perfect son.\u00a0</p><p>Through school he\u2019d rebelled against them, which only made everyone unhappy, so once he was older, he tried the opposite - to do what they wanted, to conform to their ideals of being a straight, cisgender young version of his father, on track to be a lawyer. But this was never good enough for them either, probably because it made Dan so miserable that he never truly gave it all he\u2019d got. It\u2019s always seemed to Dan that nothing he did would ever quite please them, so he\u2019d run off instead, done the thing he knew would upset them and said\u00a0\u2018fuck the consequences\u2019. There\u2019s no point trying to explain his actions to either of them - not that his father would so much as speak to him, probably - because Dan doesn\u2019t have answers or reasons for his actions right now, and that\u2019s not what they want to hear.\u00a0</p><p>To distract himself from the thousands of pounding, unpleasant thoughts rampaging through his mind, Dan heads for the stairs, intending to try and creep through the mezzanine without being seen. At a furtive glance, Dan sees the lounge area is rammed with people, some of which are spilling out onto the balcony, through the doors that have been opened. The sleet storm is dying down, but it\u2019s not completely over, meaning that some speckles of icy water are flying in. </p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t know for sure of course, but he highly doubts that Mona would have been the one to allow this, so it\u2019s probably a Nikolai-request. He\u2019s almost across the room, at the top of the stairs leading down to the lobby, when Mona spots him. </p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d she near-shrieks, sounding seconds away from an even wilder tone of voice. \u201cDan, could you come here, please? Now?\u201d</p><p>Suppressing a loud scream, Dan fixes a wobbly smile in place, and heads towards her. He notes that every single chair is occupied - people have pulled out beanbag chairs, trunks and stools, and crammed around the scatter of tables. It\u2019s unnerving to see the room so teeming with bodies when it\u2019s usually empty enough that Dan could dance through it in his underwear (provided Louise didn\u2019t choose the wrong moment to look through the serving hatch). </p><p>Some of the people are familiar to Dan and some are new to him. Most of the people he doesn\u2019t recognise are huddled together in matching slate grey suits, or grouped around enormous cameras, microphones in their hands. The Fitzgeralds have managed to snag their own table in the midst of it all, looking far too excited (minus their daughter, who is plugged into her iPhone, looking extremely like Dan at that age whenever he was forcibly taken to a social situation he didn\u2019t want to be at). The Fitzgeralds are talking animatedly at Max the security man, who has squished all of his beefy, six-foot-two frame into a beanbag, arms folded, staring stoically ahead.\u00a0</p><p>Ms Stone and Ms Harris are here as well, sipping tea and looking mildly alarmed - but interested - at their unusual surroundings. Dan also spots Cornelia in the corner by the TV, talking into a mobile phone and looking decidedly unhappy about something Dan is sure would push anyone except her into crisis mode. Bryony and Hazel are leaning through the serving hatch laughing about something with Louise. PJ is flitting about, stuck to the walls with his camera to his eye, photographing seemingly everything from the sleet stains on the wooden floor to the whiskers decorating Max\u2019s chin. And Nikolai is here, of course, strolling in through the balcony doors in his long stylish coat, brushing sleet from his shoulders like it should have known better than to settle there. </p><p>When he sees Dan, he grins widely, and Dan senses the oncoming hug before it happens. Engulfed in Nikolai\u2019s cold, damp arms, the only thought pumping through Dan\u2019s treacherous mind is, most helpfully,\u00a0<i>your husband fucked my brains out last night</i>.</p><p>He manages not to let this slip off his tongue, mercifully. When Nikolai releases him, he grins again. \u201cMy favourite concierge!\u201d he bellows, slapping Dan on the shoulder. Dan wonders if Louise was right about him instantly forgetting the names of people he doesn\u2019t care about. \u201cI was wondering where you were being kept! Didn\u2019t let the place fall off the cliff then, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d Dan says, managing a weak smile as he surreptitiously rubs his shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t get the chance. Mona took over responsibility before disaster struck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAtta boy,\u201d Nikolai says; his weird accent does not suit the phrase and he seems to know it, judging by the way he clears his throat and claps his hands, distracting attention. \u201cRight everyone, I know we said an outdoor shoot would be preferable, but the weather is against us, so I suggest you set up right here. I\u2019ve been informed that <i>he </i>will be five minutes.\u201d </p><p>Dan badly hopes that the \u2018he\u2019 in question is the abominable snowman, but somehow he doubts it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026doing my best to make sure everyone has a drink and a place to sit, but you\u2019ll need to help me keep an eye\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Dan realises, belatedly, that he\u2019s been so busy half-glaring at Nikolai\u2019s big, dumb head that he hasn\u2019t been hearing a word Mona is whispering to him. </p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.\u201d Dan leans in a bit closer to her. \u201cAny idea what this is all about?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Mona replies, then darts away from him to where a slate-grey-suit man is beckoning her. </p><p>Dan sighs, scanning the crowd of people for any signs that someone might be in need of further refreshment. Nikolai has, thankfully, gone over to talk to Cornelia, so Dan is free of further sickening smalltalk with the man. He turns around, hoping to escape and hide in the kitchen so Louise can explain what the fuck is going on, when he bumps straight into Martyn Lester. He looks\u2026 completely different to this morning. His hair is neat and coiffed, he\u2019s wearing a suit and black tie, and he has an earpiece over one ear. </p><p>\u201cAfternoon, Dan,\u201d he says with a wry smile. \u201cHaving fun at the party?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe host isn\u2019t one of my best friends,\u201d Dan says carefully, inclining his head towards Nikolai. It\u2019s a bit of a risky comment, given that this man is Nikolai\u2019s brother in law, but he\u2019s hoping Louise wasn\u2019t fibbing when she claimed Martyn loathed him. </p><p>Martyn follows Dan\u2019s inclination, smile falling away. He looks quickly at the ground. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t blame you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the secret agent get up?\u201d Dan asks, gesturing to Martyn\u2019s new outfit. He\u2019s not sure what it is, but something about Martyn Lester gives of an inherently calming vibe, like he\u2019s radiating the single statement \u2018I have everything under control\u2019. Perhaps it\u2019s an older brother thing. Or, more likely, it\u2019s because he vaguely resembles Phil with his confident stance, and exhausted-yet-amused-by-everyone\u2019s-ignorance air. \u201cYou planning on taking him out?\u201d </p><p>Martyn sucks in a breath through his teeth. \u201cWouldn\u2019t say that too loud. Max has the ears of a Silverwing and the biceps of a Silverback.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at him blankly. </p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s a bat, one\u2019s a gorilla,\u201d Martyn explains. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says, \u201cI, uh, dropped out of uni.\u201d </p><p>Martyn looks at him strangely. \u201cAre you blaming your abandoned law degree for not knowing your species\u2019 of animals by heart?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, no, I-\u201d Dan breaks off, replaying the question in confusion. \u201cHow did you know it was a law degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, attention everyone,\u201d Nikolai booms, striding into the centre of the room, whipping his coat off as he goes. He tosses the garment in seemingly no particular direction and Hazel lunges forwards to catch it before it hits the ground. Nikolai doesn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cMy soon to be ex-husband has finally decided to emerge from his lair, so we\u2019ll start the interview in one minute, then move on to photos, then\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan stops listening, too intent on scanning the room for Phil. He spots him at the edge of the crowd, arms folded, looking perfect and polished - an action figure intent on some actual action, but being forced to remain pretty and dust-free, displayed on a shelf. </p><p>Martyn leaves Dan\u2019s side with a murmured excuse, at once heading to stand with his brother. Across the room, Dan notices Cornelia notice Phil\u2019s appearance as well, and take a step in his direction, but upon seeing Martyn, she stops dead in her tracks, eyes wide and round, then turns abruptly away again. Dan frowns at the peculiar behaviour he\u2019s just witnessed, vaguely recalling something Louise mentioned about she and Martyn having to argue out publicist-related drama between Phil and Nikolai a great deal when Martyn still worked for Phil.</p><p>At present, Martyn looks a lot like he still does work for Phil; he\u2019s currently steering Phil into the centre of the room, pushing quite firmly as he obviously doesn\u2019t want to move. Dan tries to catch Phil\u2019s eye, to smile sympathetically, but Phil won\u2019t look at him. He notes that Phil is wearing a tightly knotted scarf-thing around his throat, which was smart of him. Dan knows far too well that the hickey that scarf hides is, as of last night, just as vibrant as ever. </p><p>Martyn stands Phil on a small wooden crate that\u2019s been put out, and Nikolai hops deftly up onto another at his side, unfazed. Everything about Phil\u2019s body language screams discomfort, only growing worse with all the eyes on him. Along with the pang of sympathy that surges up in Dan\u2019s chest, swoops the echo of what his mum said earlier - what <i>Dan</i> had said earlier even - how that\u00a0\u2018L\u2019 word had just slipped out. Effortless, like it had been poised on the tip of his tongue for days.\u00a0</p><p>Dan\u2019s never used that word for anyone outside of family before, not even Beth. It must have been an accidental slip-up, born of a desperate desire not to let his mum win the argument, but how bizarre that it chose now to make a random appearance. He cannot possibly have fallen for Phil of all people, the man who consistently infuriates and aggravates him, who has a husband that would feel no remorse if he stepped on Dan\u2019s face on his way out of the building. To fall in love - even the <i>word </i>is terrifying - with anyone, let alone the person he should resist developing any feelings for whatsoever, is not comprehensible. He refuses to so much as dare to believe it.\u00a0</p><p>Even so, Dan wouldn\u2019t wish this kind of horrible, judgemental scrutiny on anyone, let alone Phil (who he does, admittedly, care for - he wasn\u2019t lying about that).</p><p>Martyn nods at Phil seriously, telling him something with those matching blue eyes alone, and then steps aside. Nikolai glances at Phil, who doesn\u2019t look back, and sighs. \u201cOkay. First question.\u201d </p><p>Hands shoot up; there are four reporters as far as Dan can see - each with their own mini team of tech crew. The first is a woman in a bright red blazer, who Nikolai gestures to with a silky wave of his hand. </p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai, how are you feeling in the wake of your husband\u2019s desire to divorce?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDevastated, of course,\u201d Nikolai says sombrely, hands clasped at his waist. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to give Philip all he could ever wish for, but evidently, that was not enough.\u201d </p><p>Dan\u2019s hands curl into fists; he looks at Phil, wondering what he\u2019ll add, but he\u2019s just staring at the floor, lips thin and tight. Nikolai gestures to the next reporter, an attractive, honey-haired woman with dark lipstick and a darker fitted blazer tight on her skinny waist. </p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai,\u201d she says in a low voice, ducking her head in a small bow, \u201cwould you address the recent rumours of your husband\u2019s adultery?</p><p>Nikolai laughs, straightening his tie. \u201cNo more than idle gossip sold for a price,\u201d he says airily; Dan tries to keep very still, but he gets the sense that several people are watching him closely. Probably Louise, for one. Nikolai laughs again in a long trill. \u201cFor starters, who on Earth would he be cheating with up here-\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s loosening his scarf, drawing Nikolai\u2019s attention, making him break off before the sentence ends. It\u2019s a subtle move, barely noticeable to anyone else, but Dan catches it. Nikolai pauses, zeroing in on something that Dan can\u2019t see, that nobody can see except him, standing right beside Phil, but that Dan can easily guess at.\u00a0</p><p>What the fuck is Phil playing at? Dan wonders, heartbeat pounding in his ears. It\u2019s almost like he <i>wants</i> Nikolai to see- Oh. </p><p>In a flash, Dan understands. He does want Nikolai to see the bruise. He wants him to know that the media had been right, there is a \u2018someone\u2019. Phil wants to hurt him. Nikolai is still not saying anything. There\u2019s a shadow passing over his sharp, handsome features. And then, in the next instant, it\u2019s vanished, flicked away out of the balcony doors, his easy, carefully morose expression back in position. Dan lets out a sigh of relief, quietly. Phil re-knots the scarf. </p><p>Nikolai gestures to a man with a dark widow\u2019s peak cutting a severe expression into his forehead.\u00a0\u201cNext question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Nikolai, it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d the man says in a deep, slimy voice; Dan likens it to gooey, dark molasses. \u201cWhat prompted the sudden split?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wish I could tell you,\u201d Nikolai says with a sad smile. He looks at Phil, who is still staring straight down at the ground, and heaves a long-suffering sigh. \u201cBut alas, Philip is the only one who could answer that question. I\u2019m still very much in love.\u201d </p><p>Dan snorts, the sound loud and obvious in the hushed room. He brings his hand to his mouth, immediately feigning a coughing fit. As he\u2019s spluttering, he snags Cornelia\u2019s eye across the room; she\u2019s laughing silently at him. </p><p>\u201cYes, my question is for Philip?\u201d the large, bespectacled lady Nikolai has waved to says, peering over her glasses at Phil. Phil doesn\u2019t move, but Dan senses a collective intake of breath shudder through the room, which is then held in thirty or so sets of lungs. \u201cHow has your marriage to Nikolai been?\u201d </p><p>Slowly, Phil lifts his head. He stares the lady full in the face; there\u2019s no mistaking the white hot fury in his eyes now that they\u2019re visible. \u201cGo to hell,\u201d he spits out. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll experience it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>A moment of shocked silence stretches, elastic and loaded, and then it snaps, the room erupting into noise. The reporters abandon Nikolai\u2019s \u2018hands up\u2019 system and start angrily yelling their questions, shouting over each other as chairs scrape backwards and Nikolai\u2019s various staff members jump up to keep everything under control. The most angry of the lot is the reporter Phil told to go to hell, perhaps understandably, and she charges towards the makeshift podiums, only to trip on her way and launch forwards into Nikolai\u2019s legs. </p><p>Nikolai stumbles and falls backwards, landing directly on his ass on the wooden floor behind. Shrieks of distress echo through the room, most of them coming from Mrs Fitzgerald, and seemingly everybody rushes to help Nikolai up, except Dan and Phil, who both stand rigidly in the midst of the commotion, turning to lock eyes across people\u2019s bobbing heads. </p><p>Finally, Dan is able to send him that sympathetic smile, but Phil just looks desperately miserable, and doesn\u2019t manage to return it. So instead, Dan mouths \u2018you fucked that up\u2019. The corner of Phil\u2019s mouth twitches then, just a tad, but still enough for Dan to know he got through. Warm, syrupy pride courses through Dan\u2019s veins, just from knowing he\u2019s able to make Phil feel even a tiny bit better in such a horrendous situation. Phil turns to watch Nikolai being dusted off for a moment, and as he looks away, Dan realises what the sweet, soft, melted-butter-on-toast feeling consuming him must be.

Unfortunately, privacy is a coveted thing, and as Dan soon finds out, the hotel harbours one guest who values it more than most.</i></p><p>Rating: Explicit<br />Tags: Enemies to lovers, snow, mountains, skiing, hostility, slow burn, secrecy, longing, repression, nobility, classism, cheating, eventual sex</p><h2><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F17623067%2Fchapters%2F41549267&amp;t=ZGI4Y2FkYTk0YzcxYWZiYmQxYTRlMWE1MzMwMzI2MzRkYjU2OWZmYyxicUQwS0w4Zg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQLX6-A1TlJpHUmJGXd-m-w&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdanfanciesphil.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182663419145%2Ftoo-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil&amp;m=1\"><b>Ao3 Link</b></a></h2><p><b><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182478016430/new\">Chapter One</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182479290320/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Two</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182663419145/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Three</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182830239889/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Four</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/182985976557/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Five</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183146088513/too-high-cant-come-down\">Chapter Six</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183318327771/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Seven</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183478354475/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eight</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183634739921/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Nine</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183801485578/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Ten</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/183968016711/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eleven</a><br /><a href=\"http://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184138802035/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Twelve</a><br /></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184301494045/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Thirteen</a><br /></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184463426719/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fourteen</a><br /></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184632676790/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Fifteen</a><br /></b><b><a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/184786820304/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Sixteen</a></b></p><p><b>Chapter Seventeen</b></p><p>The Fitzgeralds want omelettes for breakfast. But not just one each, Dan learns, when the two adults clean their plates and tell him, patting tummies and grinning, that they&rsquo;re ready for round two. He&rsquo;s not sure where the youngest member of their party is hiding, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t blame her for passing up on watching her parents shovel eggs into their gawping mouths like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. Dan has the unfortunate job of telling Louise that she&rsquo;s expected to fry up unlimited omelettes until the two older Fitzgeralds are completely satisfied. When she smacks him with a yolky wooden spoon, Dan can&rsquo;t say he blames her. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so violent when you&rsquo;re mad,&rdquo; Dan complains, dabbing at the yellowish stain on his shirt sleeve. </p><p>Louise shoots him a glare, whisking eggs vigorously in a bowl. &ldquo;I have good reason to do a lot worse, so I&rsquo;d scarper if I were you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing anything worse than what Nikolai is doing to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you think that&rsquo;s a viable excuse, I&rsquo;m going to chop you up and feed you to the Fitzgeralds in their next omelette.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sighs, folding his arms and feeling a lot like a petulant child. &ldquo;Agree to disagree, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, you cannot fight fire with fire. Nikolai is a powerful man. He&rsquo;s going to steam roller over you without a second thought if he catches wind of what you&rsquo;re up to with his man.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t catch wind. Our wind is thousands of miles away from anyone up here.&rdquo; That hadn&rsquo;t come out quite right, Dan thinks, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Not from everyone,&rdquo; Louise rightly points out, grinding pepper into the bowl. </p><p>An image of Martyn Lester&rsquo;s exasperated face flashes into Dan&rsquo;s mind, and he chews his lip, wondering if he and Phil are anywhere near done chatting yet. They still haven&rsquo;t left Mona&rsquo;s office, and it&rsquo;s been over half an hour. Mona&rsquo;s going beserk, muttering about etiquette and rudeness, scrubbing tables and dusting corners because she can&rsquo;t get to her desk. Dan can see her through the serving hatch, polishing the huge balcony windows with irritable vigour.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about Martyn Lester?&rdquo; Dan asks in an attempt at nonchalance.</p><p>Louise&rsquo;s lips press together, and she pours some of the egg mixture into the pan. It sizzles pleasantly, immediately beginning to bubble and release a fragrant, delicious aroma. Dan&rsquo;s stomach rumbles; he hasn&rsquo;t eaten anything today - too busy sorting out the miraculous appearance of Phil&rsquo;s sibling. </p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; She pauses, prodding at the slowly solidifying omelette with a spatula. &ldquo;We used to be pals, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Used to be?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, he quit being Phil&rsquo;s publicist. Pretty abruptly. Just up and left. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since he walked out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, brows knitting together. The anger in Louise&rsquo;s voice is unmistakable, but Dan senses he shouldn&rsquo;t press the still-sore wound. &ldquo;Do you know why?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I imagine there&rsquo;s more to it than just this, but he was never Nikolai&rsquo;s biggest fan,&rdquo; Louise says, then deftly flips the omelette. &ldquo;He told me that the only reason he ever became Phil&rsquo;s publicist was to prevent Phil from getting fucked by the guy.&rdquo; </p><p>She pauses, reflecting on her words; her eyes meet Dan&rsquo;s, and they both snort with laughter. </p><p>&ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;Martyn&rsquo;s a protective older brother type. He and Nikolai did a lot of butting heads.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it kind of hard to butt heads with someone who&rsquo;s never around?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s another reason Martyn got so frustrated,&rdquo; Louise says, shifting omelettes onto plates with swift, practiced movements. &ldquo;It was always Cornelia he&rsquo;d have to argue it out with.&rdquo; Louise looks at Dan as she shoves plates into his hands. &ldquo;You met her, right? The fiery redhead?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. She seemed cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know much more than that, but if he&rsquo;s here after having quit so dramatically, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s doubtful that he brings good tidings.&rdquo; Louise gives him a &lsquo;well?&rsquo; look, gesturing to the plates in his hands. &ldquo;Off you go, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Awash with new information, Dan then turns to the door of the kitchen, and heads out to deliver the Fitzgeralds their second serving. </p><p>*</p><p>It&rsquo;s two in the afternoon, and Phil is avoiding him. There&rsquo;s no definitive evidence of this, but Dan&rsquo;s ninety-nine percent sure. He&rsquo;s been glimpsing Phil all day, through the window in the door of the gym as he works out, hurrying through the lobby in damp clothes, sat at a table in deep conversation with Martyn, but he hasn&rsquo;t so much as caught Dan&rsquo;s eye. It&rsquo;s pissing Dan off to no end, though he&rsquo;s trying to make excuses for him as his brother&rsquo;s sudden appearance could mean all sorts of things.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, he feels like grabbing Phil by the shoulders and spinning him round so that they&rsquo;re forced to lock eyes, then telling him <i>&lsquo;hey, dickhead, you were inside of me last night, the least you can do is nod in my direction, even if you have to wait until Martyn is looking the other way&rsquo;</i>. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s at the front desk, checking in the new couple that have just arrived with Kaspar in tow: Ms Stone and Ms Harris. They&rsquo;re both in their seventies, and Ms Stone is in a wheelchair, so it&rsquo;s pretty impressive that they&rsquo;ve made it up here at all, but they&rsquo;re perfectly chipper, papery, ungloved hands tightly clasped. Dan hands over their room key, and just as Kaspar is jerking Ms Stone backwards and spinning her, rather alarmingly fast, in the direction of their wheelchair lift, Phil appears from nowhere, at the side of the desk, bright eyes screaming &lsquo;we need to talk&rsquo;. </p><p>He says a polite &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to Kaspar, who bellows an enthusiastic response that makes excessive use of the word &lsquo;Philly&rsquo;. Then, seeming not to be able to contain his urgency, Phil turns to Dan, inclining his head towards Mona&rsquo;s office.</p><p>Dan nods at him, a little annoyed that he&rsquo;s being so obvious in front of people, but telling himself Phil must have a reason. Phil slinks off, and Dan turns back to Ms Stone and Ms Harris to tell them that he&rsquo;ll be up shortly to deliver their bags. Just as they&rsquo;re disappearing from view, Dan&rsquo;s preparing to creep round to the office when he senses eyes on him. He looks about, searching for the source of the prickling sensation that&rsquo;s grazing the back of his neck. At the last second, he looks upwards; peering over the edge of the mezzanine rail is the Fitzgerald&rsquo;s teenage daughter, her blue strands of hair dangling over the wood. </p><p>She&rsquo;s looking directly at him, her stare wide and unfaltering, like she&rsquo;s attempting to pierce into his head telepathically. He cocks his head to the side, wondering whether he should call out to her, though he doesn&rsquo;t even know her first name. Just as he&rsquo;s debating what to do, she ducks backwards, out of sight, and the moment is snatched away. </p><p>When Dan gets into the office, Phil is leaned up against Mona&rsquo;s desk like some hip CEO with an &lsquo;open door policy&rsquo; for his office full of workers. He looks weary, which Dan supposes isn&rsquo;t so surprising, given that he happens to know Phil got a lot less sleep than usual last night, but there&rsquo;s something underneath it too. A bone-deep exhaustion, so intense that it radiates off him in waves. </p><p>&ldquo;Nikolai&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; Phil says without preamble. Dan&rsquo;s only just clicked the door shut behind him. He blinks at Phil slowly, a dread creeping over his body from toe to neck. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here soon. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe earlier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, then feels dumb for not having a better response to hand. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Long fingers carve narrow valleys through jet black hair. &ldquo;Apparently someone tipped off the media that Nik and I are definitely breaking it off.&rdquo; He shrugs. &ldquo;I mean, I thought I already made that pretty obvious at the charity event. Someone had new information though, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Who could possibly have any new information?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My guess is one of the vapid yuppies Nikolai has trailing around him 24-7,&rdquo; Phil replies with a sniff. &ldquo;Maybe one of them overheard when I called him yesterday. Decided to make a quick buck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; Nikolai&rsquo;s coming here why?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been able to contact me about all the new stories flying about, so he got in touch with Martyn, figuring he&rsquo;d be able to snag my attention,&rdquo; Phil says, sounding bitter.&nbsp;&ldquo;Martyn listened to Nik ranting about my radio silence for roughly thirty seconds and then hopped on a plane to warn me-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, why hasn&rsquo;t Nik been able to contact you?&rdquo; Dan asks, too sharpened from nerves to care about the details.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought he was texting you constantly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yeah, he was.&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s eyes, which have been glazed, staring into the near distance, refocus on Dan. The corner of his mouth twitches, and one of his sleek, dark eyebrows arches upwards. &ldquo;And then I suddenly became somewhat preoccupied.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, then trips over what seems to be his own foot. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s little amused smile is not as laser-focused on Dan as he&rsquo;s grown accustomed. Dan gets the distinct feeling that whilst Phil is still all too happy to have a chuckle over his idiocy, his conscious brain is somewhere else. It&rsquo;s kind of unpleasant to suddenly have the spotlight whisked off him, after having been the sole focus of Phil&rsquo;s attention for so long. He kind of wants to snap his fingers in front of those blue eyes and bring him back into the room.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nik likes to be the centre of a scandal, but only when he&rsquo;s in control of it,&rdquo; Phil muses, arms folding across his chest. He&rsquo;s silent for a moment, and Dan can practically see the wheels turning in his brain. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s&hellip; something else, too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s heart picks up its pace. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a rumour, apparently, that I have&hellip; someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Someone?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like, someone that&rsquo;s making me want to leave my husband.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s breathing stalls. He feels Mona&rsquo;s floor cracking beneath his feet. &ldquo;Surely people can&rsquo;t know about-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; Phil says, running a hand through his hair again. It seems to be an unconscious action, whenever he feels stressed. &ldquo;But we should probably be careful.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Careful</i>?&rdquo; Dan repeats, astounded. &ldquo;You mean like subtly beckoning me in here to talk in private, right in front of brand new guests? And Kaspar?&rdquo; Phil gives him a look, but Dan can feel himself getting worked up. If he stays in this small room with Phil for much longer, he&rsquo;s going to boil over and say something he regrets. &ldquo;I-I have to get out of here-&rdquo;</p><p>Behind him, the latch of the door twitches before he so much as moves a muscle. Dan knows this because he&rsquo;s leant against it; the wooden lever is digging into the small of his back. He locks eyes with Phil, alarmed, and witnesses what he imagines is reflection of his own fear painting Phil&rsquo;s face. The latch lifts properly this time, and the door pushes against Dan, but he uses all his weight to prevent it opening. </p><p>He mouths <i>&lsquo;help me&rsquo;</i> to Phil, who jumps to action at once, coming to assist Dan as he holds the door closed. From the other side, Mona&rsquo;s voice calls, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s in there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; Dan hisses under his breath. The door rattles; she&rsquo;s growing impatient. </p><p>Phil is staring searching Dan&rsquo;s face for some kind of plan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Mona,&rdquo; Phil calls out. Dan gapes at him. Surely he cannot be about to reveal that the two of them are in here, alone, seconds after telling Dan they need to keep their shit on the DL. &ldquo;My brother and I needed the office again. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause. The door stops rattling. &ldquo;Why is the door locked?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan presses his mouth together, trying not to breathe too loudly, in case Mona could recognise the air rushing from his lungs. Phil looks skyward, grasping for a response. &ldquo;We, uh, didn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed. It&rsquo;s a serious, uh, matter we&rsquo;re discussing. Could you just give us five more minutes, please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr Novokoric, I really need to get to my desk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just five minutes,&rdquo; Phil begs, then squeezes his eyes shut. </p><p>Dan bites his lip, praying. Eventually, Mona says, &ldquo;fine. But after that, you&rsquo;ll have to find somewhere else to go. Like your suite, perhaps. Or Mr Lester&rsquo;s perfectly adequate room.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Phil says, shooting Dan a look of relief. &ldquo;Thanks, Mona.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Five minutes!&rdquo; </p><p>The sound of her kitten heels click-clacking away are like music to Dan&rsquo;s ears. He blows out a huge puff of air, slumping against the door. &ldquo;Fuck, that was close. No idea how we&rsquo;d have explained that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And we weren&rsquo;t even doing anything fun to explain away,&rdquo; Phil says regretfully,&nbsp;aiming a half-smile at Dan.</p><p>He tries not to return it, but fails spectacularly. &ldquo;I should go,&rdquo; Dan says, partly because he can sense this conversation heading into dangerous territory, and what they absolutely do not need is for Mona to come back in five minutes and walk in on something even worse. &ldquo;Let me out first, you follow in a minute or two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Dan,&rdquo; Phil says, grabbing hold of his arm. He lets go pretty fast, but it was a telling move. Dan stops, waiting to hear him out. &ldquo;I- I know this is all&hellip; not ideal. I didn&rsquo;t know Martyn was coming, and obviously the timing is pretty crap what with everything that happened last night&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan blushes, looking away. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s family for you, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And with Nik coming, I don&rsquo;t know when we&rsquo;ll next get a chance to&hellip;&rdquo; Phil trails off, and Dan&rsquo;s eyes bulge. Phil laughs at his expression. &ldquo;To be alone. To talk. Whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess that wouldn&rsquo;t be wise whilst they&rsquo;re all&hellip; watching.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Phil says, leaning back on his hands. His cheeks are vaguely stained with magenta. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Dan echoes. </p><p>A beam of clear, glossy light pierces Dan&rsquo;s mind, softening his pounding heart. He recognises this half-conversation. Phil is asking for something, without using real words. A tiny smile playing on his mouth, Dan steps in front of him, takes his dumb, emotionally stunted face in both hands, and kisses him, soft and slow. He only lets it last a moment, just long enough for the taste of Phil&rsquo;s tongue to seep through, so Dan can remember it. </p><p>He leans back, and says, &ldquo;catch you later. Good luck.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiles, eyes flicking towards the ceiling for a moment before landing back on Dan. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he says quietly, then moves away from the door so Dan can open it. As he steps through, back into the lobby, Dan turns for a final look. Phil&rsquo;s watching him with a worried expression, though he does give Dan a tiny wave. &ldquo;Go do some work,&rdquo; he says gruffly, then turns back into the office, breaking their gaze. </p><p>*</p><p>Not even fifteen minutes after exiting Mona&rsquo;s office, Dan&rsquo;s dragging Ms Stone&rsquo;s and Ms Harris&rsquo; cases up the stairs when he hears a sound he vividly remembers being traumatised by at an earlier date. The fact that he knows the deafening rumble from overhead is not an earthquake or avalanche does not make it any less chilling. Dan stops mid-flight of stairs and cranes his neck upwards, as if he could see through the roof of the hotel, then pierce through the steel of the plane into the cabin where Nikolai Novokoric is no doubt lounging in a reclining seat, sipping champagne. </p><p>He listens to the plane swoop low, then hit the tarmac, the engine stuttering, then cutting out entirely. With a desperate sigh, Dan continues his climb to the second floor, bags in tow. </p><p>*</p><p>Nikolai&rsquo;s shrill, grating voice echoes off the wooden walls of the hotel from the moment he walks through the door. A shudder runs through Dan&rsquo;s body as he hears those first few notes of posh, slightly Swiss bolstering. To escape, he goes to clean room two, the Fitzgerald&rsquo;s room, whilst they&rsquo;re out on a hike with Kaspar. They hadn&rsquo;t been enthusiastic to go, but as they&rsquo;re on an all expenses paid for trip, they couldn&rsquo;t exactly argue with Mona when she&rsquo;d scheduled it for them. </p><p>Dan closes the door behind him, breathing a long sigh. It feels like the first moment he&rsquo;s been alone in days, although of course that&rsquo;s not true. The Fitzgerald&rsquo;s room is a tip, and it&rsquo;s not all that surprising. Their mini fridge has been gutted, and there are packets of peanuts and mini liquor bottles scattered on every available surface. It&rsquo;s a family room, with a double bed on one side, and a single bed against the window. The single bed is half-heartedly made, but the double is in complete disarray - the pillows are dumped on the floor and the sheets are stained with what looks like Dorito dust. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I expected,&rdquo; Dan mutters to himself. </p><p>He&rsquo;s just setting to work when he realises that above the mundane cleaning noises, he can still hear Nikolai somewhere downstairs - his loud, boisterous laughter and fake enthusiasm. He needs a distraction, badly, but doesn&rsquo;t have anything to hand. He supposes he could call his mother back, at last. He hasn&rsquo;t spoken to her since the day after he arrived at The Secret of the Alps, so he owes her a phone call. He can do it as he works, perhaps that will make it easier to stomach. </p><p>With twitching fingers Dan pulls out his phone and dials his childhood home number, before he can talk himself out of it. She picks up on the third ring. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; </p><p>He swallows, throat tightening. Is it possible that he already regrets phoning her when all she&rsquo;s said is his name? &ldquo;Hi, Mum.&rdquo; </p><p>He sets the phone to loudspeaker, and crouches down to begin emptying the overflowing wastepaper bin.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard from you in weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>Wow, straight in with the guilt trip. No point wasting time, he supposes. &ldquo;No. Sorry. I&rsquo;ve been very busy here. Long work days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; </p><p>The phone crackles. It&rsquo;s an excruciating sound. To dispel the awkwardness, Dan asks, &ldquo;how&rsquo;ve things been?&rdquo; </p><p>She sighs loudly. &ldquo;Fine, fine. Your father&rsquo;s had that ear thing again.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says. He ties the rubbish bag tightly, then sets it by the door. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad. Hope he gets it sorted.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, you know what he&rsquo;s like about seeing doctors. Stubborn old man, just like his son.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan knows, he <i>knows</i> it&rsquo;s a provocation, intent on riling him up, but he still falls for it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> like him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So listen to your mother, and come home,&rdquo; his mother says, her voice slipping into the one Dan is so used to, sharp and cold. &ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s best for you, Daniel. You&rsquo;re too young make such a hugely affecting decision. Throwing away your chance at a degree, it&rsquo;s reckless! You&rsquo;ll end up with no money, stuck in a low-paying job forever-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Money isn&rsquo;t important to me, Mum.&rdquo; He heads for the double bed, starting to throw pillows onto it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be important to you when you run out of it,&rdquo; his mum replies with a sniff. </p><p>&ldquo;I have a job,&rdquo; Dan says slowly, as if drawing out the syllables could help her understand the one thing she&rsquo;s always failed to. In his hand he clasps a pillow, ready to be screamed into at any moment. &ldquo;I have savings, and a place to live. I&rsquo;m getting by just fine. I don&rsquo;t see what the point is of forcing myself to toil through a degree in a subject I hate, to secure a job I&rsquo;ll despise, racking up a load of debt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being naiive,&rdquo; she says, for what must be the hundredth time. Dan sighs, flopping down onto on the floor by the Fitzgeralds&rsquo; bed, abandoning all attempt at continuing the clean. &ldquo;The world won&rsquo;t be kind to you if you&rsquo;re unintelligent and unqualified. What do you suppose you&rsquo;re going to do with yourself? Change beds in a hotel up God-knows-what-mountain forever? It&rsquo;s just not realistic-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan looks at the pillow he&rsquo;s still holding, wondering if she&rsquo;s somehow able to sense that he&rsquo;s doing exactly that. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I would be doing this forever.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s arms wrap around the pillow, miserably. He&rsquo;s trembling slightly, because he detests so much as thinking about his future given that it&rsquo;s so uncertain. He&rsquo;s here now, for the foreseeable weeks ahead, and that&rsquo;s some stability at least. He curls his fingers into the pillow&rsquo;s soft material, trying to breathe through the anxiety attack he can feel brewing. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too late for you to come back, you know,&rdquo; his mum says; her voice is kinder now, the edges softened. It would be so easy to fall into the trap of her mumsy words, to run back down the mountain into her arms. She&rsquo;d waste no time in calling up the University and re-enrolling him in his awful law degree, then locking him straight back into his prison-cell dorm room. &ldquo;Your dad and I would sort it all out for you,&rdquo; she says, like she can read his mind,&nbsp;&ldquo;it hasn&rsquo;t been too long, we could talk to people, chalk this up to a minor blip in judgement.&rdquo; </p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause. Dan mouths some things he wants to say, but won&rsquo;t. <i>Why can&rsquo;t you try to understand me properly? Why don&rsquo;t my opinions matter just because I&rsquo;m young? Why would I want to be a lawyer, miserable in my office for the next fifty years just like Dad&rsquo;s been, living for the weekend like that&rsquo;s the way life&rsquo;s supposed to be lived?</i></p><p>&ldquo;You know, I saw on Facebook that Beth is still single,&rdquo; his mum says in a hesitant voice, and that&rsquo;s the moment Dan decides the catch-up is over. </p><p>&ldquo;I have to go, mum,&rdquo; Dan says, proud that his voice cracks only a small amount as he reaches for the phone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the middle of my shift.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, Dan,&rdquo; his mum says quickly, and something about the urgency of her voice makes him listen. His thumb hovers over the red &lsquo;end call&rsquo; button. &ldquo;I&hellip; had Vanessa and Darren round for lunch yesterday. They were talking about some scandal that&rsquo;s been in the news. About that young heir of the Swiss Royal family. The gay one, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>Icy fingers wrap around Dan&rsquo;s heart. He reminds himself to remain calm, that there&rsquo;s no way she could possibly know he has any involvement. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bisexual, actually,&rdquo; Dan corrects in a mock-casual voice. &ldquo;Vanessa and Darren had fascinating insights into the situation I&rsquo;m sure, but Mum, I really have to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it at first,&rdquo; his mum continues, like Dan hadn&rsquo;t spoken. There&rsquo;s something wrong with her voice. It&rsquo;s too shrill, too forced. &ldquo;But I was thinking it over later, and I realised I <i>knew</i> the place this Sir Nicholas&rsquo; husband is rumoured to be. It&rsquo;s the same mountain you told me your hotel is on.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes flutter closed. This surely can<i>not</i> be happening. His mother barely remembers his birthday, let alone the specific mountain in the vast range of the Alps he decided to run off to. </p><p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Dan says, because anything else would be too incriminating. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; his mother says in a small, strangled voice. &ldquo;Oh, God, it&rsquo;s you darling, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s me?&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes squeeze together; but even as he wishes for anything else, he knows she&rsquo;s guessed the truth. Her shame is like poison, seeping out of the phone into his ear, plucking Dan&rsquo;s worst anxieties from their dark corners.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I always knew there was something you were keeping from me,&rdquo; she half-wails in a soft, crackly voice. &ldquo;Some reason you tucked away inside that you felt made you- you <i>different</i> from everyone else. Oh Dan, honey, this is so not the way to deal with it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it when I had the thought, but I went back through those texts you sent me when you first arrived,&rdquo; his mum says in a rush. &ldquo;About the famous guest who you didn&rsquo;t get along with, how you were dreading spending so much time alone with him. It&rsquo;s him, isn&rsquo;t it, Dan? It&rsquo;s the one they&rsquo;re all saying is- is- cheating. With a waiter.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan lets the disdain in her voice slip through his skin, burrow into his well of shame that&rsquo;s already deep and bubbling.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respond for a while, weighing up all the things he could try and say to dissuade her, to convince her that she&rsquo;s wrong. Instead, wearied by even the thought of exerting himself to insist such a lie is true, he just corrects her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a concierge, not a waiter.&rdquo; His mum lets out a sort of sob-noise. &ldquo;Mum,&rdquo; Dan says quickly, frightened by her reaction suddenly, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t tell anyone. Mum, do you understand?&rdquo; </p><p>She breathes thickly. &ldquo;Oh, God, Dan, this is- why did you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I planned it,&rdquo; Dan says, feeling his hackles rise. &ldquo;This is so typical of you, Mum, judging me from afar, all my choices and decisions when you have no idea about any of it-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So explain this to me!&rdquo; she cries, still unbearably shrill. &ldquo;Is this as bright of a decision as dropping out of university, or breaking up with your lovely girlfriend, or running away to scrub toilets up a mountain?! What on earth are you thinking, you daft-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love him!&rdquo; Dan interrupts, the words surging out of him like vomit. His eyes widen as soon as they&rsquo;re out, as if he can see them hanging in the air before him, hovering like flies above the Fitzgeralds&rsquo; bag of trash. &ldquo;I- I mean, I care about him. I don&rsquo;t- I don&rsquo;t know why I said- forget that. But I do care. His marriage is toxic, Mum. If you knew the truth, if the rest of the world knew - if Vanessa and Derren knew what Nikolai was <i>like</i>-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; his mum asks, weakly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d fall in love with him, too?&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Dan leaves the Fitzgeralds room without finishing the clean; his conversation with his mother has left him too agitated to focus on something so mundane. He remembers now - too late, of course - why he&rsquo;s been so reluctant to call her back. He had not left home on good terms with his parents - his father refused to even say goodbye. They&rsquo;ve always been hideously conservative in their views, so Dan with his liberal politics and marginally effeminate&nbsp;&lsquo;emo&rsquo; dress sense growing up had never really been their idea of the perfect son.&nbsp;</p><p>Through school he&rsquo;d rebelled against them, which only made everyone unhappy, so once he was older, he tried the opposite - to do what they wanted, to conform to their ideals of being a straight, cisgender young version of his father, on track to be a lawyer. But this was never good enough for them either, probably because it made Dan so miserable that he never truly gave it all he&rsquo;d got. It&rsquo;s always seemed to Dan that nothing he did would ever quite please them, so he&rsquo;d run off instead, done the thing he knew would upset them and said&nbsp;&lsquo;fuck the consequences&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s no point trying to explain his actions to either of them - not that his father would so much as speak to him, probably - because Dan doesn&rsquo;t have answers or reasons for his actions right now, and that&rsquo;s not what they want to hear.&nbsp;</p><p>To distract himself from the thousands of pounding, unpleasant thoughts rampaging through his mind, Dan heads for the stairs, intending to try and creep through the mezzanine without being seen. At a furtive glance, Dan sees the lounge area is rammed with people, some of which are spilling out onto the balcony, through the doors that have been opened. The sleet storm is dying down, but it&rsquo;s not completely over, meaning that some speckles of icy water are flying in. </p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t know for sure of course, but he highly doubts that Mona would have been the one to allow this, so it&rsquo;s probably a Nikolai-request. He&rsquo;s almost across the room, at the top of the stairs leading down to the lobby, when Mona spots him. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; she near-shrieks, sounding seconds away from an even wilder tone of voice. &ldquo;Dan, could you come here, please? Now?&rdquo;</p><p>Suppressing a loud scream, Dan fixes a wobbly smile in place, and heads towards her. He notes that every single chair is occupied - people have pulled out beanbag chairs, trunks and stools, and crammed around the scatter of tables. It&rsquo;s unnerving to see the room so teeming with bodies when it&rsquo;s usually empty enough that Dan could dance through it in his underwear (provided Louise didn&rsquo;t choose the wrong moment to look through the serving hatch). </p><p>Some of the people are familiar to Dan and some are new to him. Most of the people he doesn&rsquo;t recognise are huddled together in matching slate grey suits, or grouped around enormous cameras, microphones in their hands. The Fitzgeralds have managed to snag their own table in the midst of it all, looking far too excited (minus their daughter, who is plugged into her iPhone, looking extremely like Dan at that age whenever he was forcibly taken to a social situation he didn&rsquo;t want to be at). The Fitzgeralds are talking animatedly at Max the security man, who has squished all of his beefy, six-foot-two frame into a beanbag, arms folded, staring stoically ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Stone and Ms Harris are here as well, sipping tea and looking mildly alarmed - but interested - at their unusual surroundings. Dan also spots Cornelia in the corner by the TV, talking into a mobile phone and looking decidedly unhappy about something Dan is sure would push anyone except her into crisis mode. Bryony and Hazel are leaning through the serving hatch laughing about something with Louise. PJ is flitting about, stuck to the walls with his camera to his eye, photographing seemingly everything from the sleet stains on the wooden floor to the whiskers decorating Max&rsquo;s chin. And Nikolai is here, of course, strolling in through the balcony doors in his long stylish coat, brushing sleet from his shoulders like it should have known better than to settle there. </p><p>When he sees Dan, he grins widely, and Dan senses the oncoming hug before it happens. Engulfed in Nikolai&rsquo;s cold, damp arms, the only thought pumping through Dan&rsquo;s treacherous mind is, most helpfully,&nbsp;<i>your husband fucked my brains out last night</i>.</p><p>He manages not to let this slip off his tongue, mercifully. When Nikolai releases him, he grins again. &ldquo;My favourite concierge!&rdquo; he bellows, slapping Dan on the shoulder. Dan wonders if Louise was right about him instantly forgetting the names of people he doesn&rsquo;t care about. &ldquo;I was wondering where you were being kept! Didn&rsquo;t let the place fall off the cliff then, I see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo; Dan says, managing a weak smile as he surreptitiously rubs his shoulder. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t get the chance. Mona took over responsibility before disaster struck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Atta boy,&rdquo; Nikolai says; his weird accent does not suit the phrase and he seems to know it, judging by the way he clears his throat and claps his hands, distracting attention. &ldquo;Right everyone, I know we said an outdoor shoot would be preferable, but the weather is against us, so I suggest you set up right here. I&rsquo;ve been informed that <i>he </i>will be five minutes.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan badly hopes that the &lsquo;he&rsquo; in question is the abominable snowman, but somehow he doubts it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;doing my best to make sure everyone has a drink and a place to sit, but you&rsquo;ll need to help me keep an eye&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Dan realises, belatedly, that he&rsquo;s been so busy half-glaring at Nikolai&rsquo;s big, dumb head that he hasn&rsquo;t been hearing a word Mona is whispering to him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hm? Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.&rdquo; Dan leans in a bit closer to her. &ldquo;Any idea what this is all about?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;None whatsoever,&rdquo; Mona replies, then darts away from him to where a slate-grey-suit man is beckoning her. </p><p>Dan sighs, scanning the crowd of people for any signs that someone might be in need of further refreshment. Nikolai has, thankfully, gone over to talk to Cornelia, so Dan is free of further sickening smalltalk with the man. He turns around, hoping to escape and hide in the kitchen so Louise can explain what the fuck is going on, when he bumps straight into Martyn Lester. He looks&hellip; completely different to this morning. His hair is neat and coiffed, he&rsquo;s wearing a suit and black tie, and he has an earpiece over one ear. </p><p>&ldquo;Afternoon, Dan,&rdquo; he says with a wry smile. &ldquo;Having fun at the party?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The host isn&rsquo;t one of my best friends,&rdquo; Dan says carefully, inclining his head towards Nikolai. It&rsquo;s a bit of a risky comment, given that this man is Nikolai&rsquo;s brother in law, but he&rsquo;s hoping Louise wasn&rsquo;t fibbing when she claimed Martyn loathed him. </p><p>Martyn follows Dan&rsquo;s inclination, smile falling away. He looks quickly at the ground. &ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t blame you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the secret agent get up?&rdquo; Dan asks, gesturing to Martyn&rsquo;s new outfit. He&rsquo;s not sure what it is, but something about Martyn Lester gives of an inherently calming vibe, like he&rsquo;s radiating the single statement &lsquo;I have everything under control&rsquo;. Perhaps it&rsquo;s an older brother thing. Or, more likely, it&rsquo;s because he vaguely resembles Phil with his confident stance, and exhausted-yet-amused-by-everyone&rsquo;s-ignorance air. &ldquo;You planning on taking him out?&rdquo; </p><p>Martyn sucks in a breath through his teeth. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t say that too loud. Max has the ears of a Silverwing and the biceps of a Silverback.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan looks at him blankly. </p><p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s a bat, one&rsquo;s a gorilla,&rdquo; Martyn explains. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says, &ldquo;I, uh, dropped out of uni.&rdquo; </p><p>Martyn looks at him strangely. &ldquo;Are you blaming your abandoned law degree for not knowing your species&rsquo; of animals by heart?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, no, I-&rdquo; Dan breaks off, replaying the question in confusion. &ldquo;How did you know it was a law degree?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, attention everyone,&rdquo; Nikolai booms, striding into the centre of the room, whipping his coat off as he goes. He tosses the garment in seemingly no particular direction and Hazel lunges forwards to catch it before it hits the ground. Nikolai doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice. &ldquo;My soon to be ex-husband has finally decided to emerge from his lair, so we&rsquo;ll start the interview in one minute, then move on to photos, then&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stops listening, too intent on scanning the room for Phil. He spots him at the edge of the crowd, arms folded, looking perfect and polished - an action figure intent on some actual action, but being forced to remain pretty and dust-free, displayed on a shelf. </p><p>Martyn leaves Dan&rsquo;s side with a murmured excuse, at once heading to stand with his brother. Across the room, Dan notices Cornelia notice Phil&rsquo;s appearance as well, and take a step in his direction, but upon seeing Martyn, she stops dead in her tracks, eyes wide and round, then turns abruptly away again. Dan frowns at the peculiar behaviour he&rsquo;s just witnessed, vaguely recalling something Louise mentioned about she and Martyn having to argue out publicist-related drama between Phil and Nikolai a great deal when Martyn still worked for Phil.</p><p>At present, Martyn looks a lot like he still does work for Phil; he&rsquo;s currently steering Phil into the centre of the room, pushing quite firmly as he obviously doesn&rsquo;t want to move. Dan tries to catch Phil&rsquo;s eye, to smile sympathetically, but Phil won&rsquo;t look at him. He notes that Phil is wearing a tightly knotted scarf-thing around his throat, which was smart of him. Dan knows far too well that the hickey that scarf hides is, as of last night, just as vibrant as ever. </p><p>Martyn stands Phil on a small wooden crate that&rsquo;s been put out, and Nikolai hops deftly up onto another at his side, unfazed. Everything about Phil&rsquo;s body language screams discomfort, only growing worse with all the eyes on him. Along with the pang of sympathy that surges up in Dan&rsquo;s chest, swoops the echo of what his mum said earlier - what <i>Dan</i> had said earlier even - how that&nbsp;&lsquo;L&rsquo; word had just slipped out. Effortless, like it had been poised on the tip of his tongue for days.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s never used that word for anyone outside of family before, not even Beth. It must have been an accidental slip-up, born of a desperate desire not to let his mum win the argument, but how bizarre that it chose now to make a random appearance. He cannot possibly have fallen for Phil of all people, the man who consistently infuriates and aggravates him, who has a husband that would feel no remorse if he stepped on Dan&rsquo;s face on his way out of the building. To fall in love - even the <i>word </i>is terrifying - with anyone, let alone the person he should resist developing any feelings for whatsoever, is not comprehensible. He refuses to so much as dare to believe it.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, Dan wouldn&rsquo;t wish this kind of horrible, judgemental scrutiny on anyone, let alone Phil (who he does, admittedly, care for - he wasn&rsquo;t lying about that).</p><p>Martyn nods at Phil seriously, telling him something with those matching blue eyes alone, and then steps aside. Nikolai glances at Phil, who doesn&rsquo;t look back, and sighs. &ldquo;Okay. First question.&rdquo; </p><p>Hands shoot up; there are four reporters as far as Dan can see - each with their own mini team of tech crew. The first is a woman in a bright red blazer, who Nikolai gestures to with a silky wave of his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir Nikolai, how are you feeling in the wake of your husband&rsquo;s desire to divorce?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Devastated, of course,&rdquo; Nikolai says sombrely, hands clasped at his waist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to give Philip all he could ever wish for, but evidently, that was not enough.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hands curl into fists; he looks at Phil, wondering what he&rsquo;ll add, but he&rsquo;s just staring at the floor, lips thin and tight. Nikolai gestures to the next reporter, an attractive, honey-haired woman with dark lipstick and a darker fitted blazer tight on her skinny waist. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir Nikolai,&rdquo; she says in a low voice, ducking her head in a small bow, &ldquo;would you address the recent rumours of your husband&rsquo;s adultery?</p><p>Nikolai laughs, straightening his tie. &ldquo;No more than idle gossip sold for a price,&rdquo; he says airily; Dan tries to keep very still, but he gets the sense that several people are watching him closely. Probably Louise, for one. Nikolai laughs again in a long trill. &ldquo;For starters, who on Earth would he be cheating with up here-&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s loosening his scarf, drawing Nikolai&rsquo;s attention, making him break off before the sentence ends. It&rsquo;s a subtle move, barely noticeable to anyone else, but Dan catches it. Nikolai pauses, zeroing in on something that Dan can&rsquo;t see, that nobody can see except him, standing right beside Phil, but that Dan can easily guess at.&nbsp;</p><p>What the fuck is Phil playing at? Dan wonders, heartbeat pounding in his ears. It&rsquo;s almost like he <i>wants</i> Nikolai to see- Oh. </p><p>In a flash, Dan understands. He does want Nikolai to see the bruise. He wants him to know that the media had been right, there is a &lsquo;someone&rsquo;. Phil wants to hurt him. Nikolai is still not saying anything. There&rsquo;s a shadow passing over his sharp, handsome features. And then, in the next instant, it&rsquo;s vanished, flicked away out of the balcony doors, his easy, carefully morose expression back in position. Dan lets out a sigh of relief, quietly. Phil re-knots the scarf. </p><p>Nikolai gestures to a man with a dark widow&rsquo;s peak cutting a severe expression into his forehead.&nbsp;&ldquo;Next question?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir Nikolai, it&rsquo;s a pleasure,&rdquo; the man says in a deep, slimy voice; Dan likens it to gooey, dark molasses. &ldquo;What prompted the sudden split?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wish I could tell you,&rdquo; Nikolai says with a sad smile. He looks at Phil, who is still staring straight down at the ground, and heaves a long-suffering sigh. &ldquo;But alas, Philip is the only one who could answer that question. I&rsquo;m still very much in love.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan snorts, the sound loud and obvious in the hushed room. He brings his hand to his mouth, immediately feigning a coughing fit. As he&rsquo;s spluttering, he snags Cornelia&rsquo;s eye across the room; she&rsquo;s laughing silently at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my question is for Philip?&rdquo; the large, bespectacled lady Nikolai has waved to says, peering over her glasses at Phil. Phil doesn&rsquo;t move, but Dan senses a collective intake of breath shudder through the room, which is then held in thirty or so sets of lungs. &ldquo;How has your marriage to Nikolai been?&rdquo; </p><p>Slowly, Phil lifts his head. He stares the lady full in the face; there&rsquo;s no mistaking the white hot fury in his eyes now that they&rsquo;re visible. &ldquo;Go to hell,&rdquo; he spits out. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll experience it for yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>A moment of shocked silence stretches, elastic and loaded, and then it snaps, the room erupting into noise. The reporters abandon Nikolai&rsquo;s &lsquo;hands up&rsquo; system and start angrily yelling their questions, shouting over each other as chairs scrape backwards and Nikolai&rsquo;s various staff members jump up to keep everything under control. The most angry of the lot is the reporter Phil told to go to hell, perhaps understandably, and she charges towards the makeshift podiums, only to trip on her way and launch forwards into Nikolai&rsquo;s legs. </p><p>Nikolai stumbles and falls backwards, landing directly on his ass on the wooden floor behind. Shrieks of distress echo through the room, most of them coming from Mrs Fitzgerald, and seemingly everybody rushes to help Nikolai up, except Dan and Phil, who both stand rigidly in the midst of the commotion, turning to lock eyes across people&rsquo;s bobbing heads. </p><p>Finally, Dan is able to send him that sympathetic smile, but Phil just looks desperately miserable, and doesn&rsquo;t manage to return it. So instead, Dan mouths &lsquo;you fucked that up&rsquo;. The corner of Phil&rsquo;s mouth twitches then, just a tad, but still enough for Dan to know he got through. Warm, syrupy pride courses through Dan&rsquo;s veins, just from knowing he&rsquo;s able to make Phil feel even a tiny bit better in such a horrendous situation. Phil turns to watch Nikolai being dusted off for a moment, and as he looks away, Dan realises what the sweet, soft, melted-butter-on-toast feeling consuming him must be. He <i>loves</i> this pompous idiot with a fuse shorter than most matches.</p><p>Phil fixes that gellid blue gaze back on him and rolls his eyes in regard to Nikolai&rsquo;s theatrics. And right then, in that moment Dan knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that he&rsquo;s completely, Royally fucked.&nbsp;</p><p><b>(<a href=\"https://danfanciesphil.tumblr.com/post/185111534550/too-high-cant-come-down-by-danfanciesphil\">Chapter Eighteen!</a>)</b></p>",

The only thing worse than sinking again is letting Phil see him sink again. He had tried. He\u2019d tried to be better, stay better for the sake of Phil. If only so he wouldn\u2019t have to see concern and worry and even sadness pool in those bright blue eyes. But sometimes he just couldn\u2019t help falling back into the dark abyss of emptiness. What else could he do if everything is pointless anyways.</p><p>Dan felt the edge of his bed dip. He shut his eyes, not wanting to face the world. Not wanting to face his roommate and the fact that he\u2019s a disappointment for letting his roommate down again. He knows Phil would never blame him, but deep down he blames himself for causing Phil so much worry.</p><p>Gentle hands pulled the blanket off his face. Dan blinked up, regretting it instantly when he saw Phil\u2019s brows crease.</p><p>Phil hated seeing him like this. He knew that behind that lifeless stare was a warm hazel, full of wonder and awe. He loved seeing those eyes look back at him with excitement when they skip lectures for a movie, how they twinkle with hope when Phil assures him that everything will be fine in times when he couldn\u2019t see anything positive in his future. Or in times when he couldn\u2019t see himself even having a future at all.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br/></p><p>Whenever Dan was in this dark part of his mind, he just felt numb and emotionless. But Phil could simply say two words and suddenly his eyes stung with tears, his heart beat with fury and he felt too much all at once.</p><p>He wanted to answer Phil, wanted to yell at him, wanted to disappear. But he didn\u2019t have the energy for any of that. All he could do was shrug and shut his eyes again.</p><p>Phil brushed away the curl that was covering Dan\u2019s forehead. Dan can\u2019t remember the last time he had a haircut, and he was sure that his messy tangled curls were definitely an unruly sight.</p><p>\u201cCould you try to get up for me please? I know you haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday and we should have lunch now,\u201d Phil spoke softly, his words so full of care that Dan can\u2019t deny his requests even if he wanted to.<br/></p><p>Dan felt like his whole body was protesting as he tried to sit up. He\u2019d been in bed since yesterday afternoon, and judging from Phil returning from school, it was probably past noon now. Still it didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d had any rest at all. His mouth felt dry, but he didn\u2019t have the appetite to eat or even drink.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not hungry,\u201d was all Dan managed to mumble out.<br/></p><p>Phil bit his lip as he thought of how to coax Dan out of his bed. He knew that Dan always tried his best for him, even if he felt too exhausted to do anything. But he also didn\u2019t want to push Dan too hard when he got like this. He took Dan\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>Dan stared at his hand being sandwiched between Phil\u2019s. Phil felt so warm around his cold hand. He slowly looked up at Phil quizzically.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a drive,\u201d Phil suggested softly.<br/></p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t a good driver; failed twice before finally getting his license and then never making use of it for a year after getting it despite having a car that was gifted to him by his parents for finally passing. Dan knew this and joked about how he would never risk his life being Phil\u2019s passenger. But there was one day when Dan was falling into the darkness again, and he said something that stuck to Phil.</p><p>Dan talked about how he just wanted to feel free. The kind of freedom where he wouldn\u2019t have to think about any responsibility he had, any failures or people he\u2019d disappointed. The kind of freedom that he knew was temporary, but forgetting about his past and future to live in the moment would help him feel at peace even if just for a while until his mind was clear enough again to face his problems.</p><p>And Dan talked about how he\u2019d feel that kind of fleeting freedom when he went on road trips. The vast fields and open skies as far as he could see down the never-ending road ahead gave him a sense of liberty. It shows him how big the world is, and how small his problems are in contrast. That there is so much more to life and what the world has to offer than his own worries and anxiety. And when he sees it that way, he\u2019ll get more confident in trying to overcome his problems, instead of letting them eat him up instead.</p><p>Since then, Phil actually started practising his driving more. Dan was skeptical at first, but Phil insisted on driving him to campus one day. Dan thought he\u2019d fear for his life, but it ended up being a really pleasant ride and he never made fun of his driving ever again.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Dan mumbled, staring at Phil\u2019s thumb tracing circles on his hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnywhere. Nowhere, it doesn\u2019t matter. But let\u2019s just get out of here for a while,\u201d Phil said, hoping for Dan to agree.<br/></p><p>When Dan looked back up at Phil, all Phil could see was a cold, despondent stare that he was determined to bring warmth back into.</p><p>Dan\u2019s whole body felt heavy, it was screaming at him to go back under the covers. But he looked at Phil, looked at his hopeful smile and his encouraging eyes. He already felt enough of a disappointment, he just couldn\u2019t disappoint his best friend any further.\u00a0</p><p>So Dan gave a small nod, making Phil\u2019s whole face light up.\u00a0</p><p>Phil quickly got up and grabbed a few pieces of clothing for both of them, shoving them into his backpack. Just in case. He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d need to drive before Dan felt better again.\u00a0</p><p>When he was done packing, he turned back to Dan whose eyebrows were knitted together as he looked at him. He was probably wondering why Phil needed to pack, but he didn\u2019t voice it out.\u00a0</p><p>Phil came back to Dan\u2019s bed and held onto Dan\u2019s hands again. He gently pulled Dan up, and Dan pliantly allowed his body to be moved as Phil pleased.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Phil said excitedly, never letting go of Dan\u2019s hand as he dragged his friend out of their room.<br/></p><hr><p>Dan immediately shut his eyes once he got settled in the car. The sun was blinding, and he felt like it was sucking whatever little energy he had left out of him. He just wanted to sleep. He trusted Phil to keep them both safe as he drove to wherever.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan in dismay. He hoped that his plan would work, he just had to give Dan time. He was feeling hungry, having missed breakfast to attend his morning lecture and missed lunch to get back to Dan as soon as he could. So he decided to get them both food first.</p><p>Phil could tell that Dan wasn\u2019t asleep because every now and then he would peek an eye open just to see where they were. So Phil knew that he wouldn\u2019t be disturbing Dan if he filled the silence with music.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brain was demanding him to sleep but shouting at him about all his worries at the same time. But through the loudness of his mind, he could still hear the song Phil started playing.\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>Sleeping is giving in<br/>No matter what the time is<br/>Sleeping is giving in<br/>So lift those heavy eyelids</i><br/></p><p>The lyrics hit Dan, and he opened his eyes and looked at Phil. He wondered if Phil chose the song on purpose.</p><p>\u201cOh sorry did you wanna sleep? I can turn it off-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d Dan interrupted,\u00a0\u201cbut what are you playing?\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil tried to hide his joy. That was the most he\u2019d heard his best friend speak at once in the past few days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my road trip playlist!\u201d he responded excitedly.<br/></p><p><i>People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya<br/>Come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour</i><br/></p><p>Dan grunted in what he hoped Phil understood as an approval before facing away from him again. He leaned against the window, staring blankly at the cars passing by. He thought about how his dreams could save him, if only they were attainable.</p><p>Dan had zoned out after that, liking the buzz in his head more than the song forcing him to be self-aware. But as Phil slowed into a driveway, he tuned back into the present.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ya wanna get?\u201d Phil asked, stopping behind a queue of cars.<br/></p><p>Dan looked around and realised that Phil had entered a McDonalds drive-thru.</p><p>Dan shrugged,\u00a0\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Dan knew that Phil knows Dan\u2019s go-to order at McDonalds anyway. And Phil knew that Dan knew that, but he was just trying to get Dan to talk.</p><p>A few minutes later, Phil was shoving a big bag onto Dan\u2019s lap. The aroma of the food did stir Dan\u2019s stomach up. It growled as Dan salivated. The thing about sinking into the darkness was that even if he was hungry, he\u2019d be too preoccupied with fighting against the demons in his head to realise. But with the food now right on his lap, he suddenly couldn\u2019t wait to eat. He looked over at Phil.</p><p>Phil smiled at him, it was the first time that day that Dan\u2019s gaze was more than just a blank, dead one. Phil thought he looked kinda cute all wide-eyed silently asking if he could eat.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead! I\u2019ll find somewhere to park first,\u201d he said as he drove into the carpark.</p><p>Dan looked into the bag. Phil had gotten him a quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. Just as he liked it. He grabbed a couple of fries and started munching on them first.</p><p>When Phil was parked, they took their food out and laid it out as best as they could on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cHow come we used the drive thru just to sit at the carpark?\u201d Dan mumbled.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to enter the place with the crowd in there and all&hellip;\u201d Phil rationalised.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Dan mused,\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have liked that. Thanks.\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil smiled, glad he did make the right choice. He started digging into his big mac, but kept a watchful eye on Dan to make sure he ate too.</p><p>Dan was still slowly munching on his fries. When he noticed that Phil was glancing over at him, he wordlessly offered Phil some of his fries.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I got my own,\u201d Phil said with his mouth still full.<br/></p><p>But Dan insisted, bringing the fries in his fingers closer to Phil\u2019s face. Phil\u2019s giggle was stifled when the fries were pushed into his mouth. Phil smiled as he chewed, happy that his friend was slowly feeling okay enough to show affection again. Dan didn\u2019t even seem bothered that his fingertips were caught between Phil\u2019s lips.</p><p>Dan quite liked feeding Phil. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly why, but he always got a sense of joy whenever he let his friend have a bite of his pizza, or fed him a forkful of pasta, or tilted his drink for Phil to take a sip. And it was nice to feel something other than emptiness as he fed Phil his fries this time.</p><p>Phil was aware how Dan liked to feed him when he was being in a cheeky mood. Dan didn\u2019t seem to be doing this to be cheeky this time, but Phil was happy it\u2019s happening all the same, and he\u2019d accept however much food being fed to him to make his friend happy.</p><p>Dan alternated between eating his fries and giving some to Phil. He liked how Phil didn\u2019t question him or make him stop, but just accepted his offer every time. When he eventually ran out of fries, he wiped his hand clean and looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou not gonna eat your burger?\u201d Phil asked, wiping his mouth as he finished his own food.<br/></p><p>Dan busied himself looking at a couple of kids laughing and running into the restaurant. Oh what fun it is to be young and free. He shook his head no.</p><p>Phil\u2019s shoulders drooped a little. He\u2019d thought that Dan was starting to feel better.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m full already,\u201d Dan answered,\u00a0\u201cmaybe later.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil responded softly.<br/></p><p>Phil started the car and slowly went out of the driveway.\u00a0He drove aimlessly. He didn\u2019t have a proper destination in mind, and he didn\u2019t really care how long he\u2019d have to drive or where they ended up as long as they were together and he\u2019d have his Dan by the end of it. He saw the sign saying they were leaving Manchester, and decided to just continue driving south.</p><p>Phil\u2019s road trip playlist started again, but the songs didn\u2019t hit home as much as the first one, so Dan asked him to restart it.</p><p><i>People try and hide the light<br/>Underneath the covers</i><br/></p><p>Dan stared out the window most of the ride. The weather was the opposite of his gloomy mood. The late afternoon sun was beaming down on them. He saw cows and sheep grazing lazily on the open fields. The clouds looked beautiful against the blue sky. For a fleeting moment, Dan let himself believe that life <i>can</i> be beautiful. He grabbed his milkshake, overwhelmed by the sudden thought. Perhaps the milkshake can give him a brain freeze that would numb him from overthinking for a while.</p><p><i>Now here&rsquo;s the sun, it&rsquo;s alright<br/>Lies, lies</i><br/></p><p>Dan appreciated that Phil didn\u2019t try to force a conversation out of him. Phil knew that he needed his space even while he needed someone to be there for him at the same time. He never thought anyone would get that, but Phil does. Phil understands him so well that it scares him as much as it comforts him sometimes. He sipped on his milkshake harder.</p><p>The song ended, Phil\u2019s playlist moving on to a more upbeat pop song. Phil tapped along to the song on his steering wheel, humming at the chorus. Dan looked over at his friend. Phil seemed so content to just drive. Drive for no reason other than for Dan to clear his mind. Although it was his petrol and his time of day that Dan was wasting.</p><p>Phil looked back over just then, and smiled at Dan. Dan pursed his lips into a forced smile, even though he meant it in a genuine way. He just couldn\u2019t understand why Phil would care for him this much.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you driving?\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil\u2019s brows creased together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean, why are you doing this? Don\u2019t you have that assignment due soon? And your petrol-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about any of that Dan, you know I\u2019m always here for you. I want to help you feel better, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Dan gulped. The sincerity in Phil\u2019s voice scared him. He didn\u2019t feel like he deserved such attention and care from anyone. He turned back to facing the road ahead. The unending path taking them to anywhere, nowhere. Taking them to wherever it is that Dan will supposedly feel better, before heading back.</p><p>Dan\u2019s reaction worried Phil a little. He was afraid that Dan might\u2019ve changed his mind about this road trip. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a good idea all along, and Dan was just following along because he felt like he had to.</p><p>\u201cWe could always go back if you want?\u201d Phil asked tentatively.<br/></p><p>Dan looked surprised for a second, but he shook his head almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like this. Thank you,\u201d Dan murmured.<br/></p><p>He wished he could show his gratitude better. Maybe when he felt better he\u2019d repay Phil somehow.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna go back at any time just tell me, alright?\u201d Phil asked, still a little worried.<br/></p><p>Dan nodded, proceeding to sip on his milkshake.</p><p>They fell into comfortable silence again. If only Dan\u2019s mind could match the silence between them.</p><p>Dan started thinking about his latest episode and the main thing on his mind. A lot of times, his mood plummeted for almost no reason at all, but sometimes he\u2019d have a clearer understanding of why it happened. Especially if his mind won\u2019t stop reminding him about his main worry at the moment.</p><p>He stole glances at Phil. Phil, his roommate of 3 years since his first day of university. Phil, who quickly became his best friend. Phil, a year his senior who would be graduating in about a month. Phil, who had been by his side through everything he\u2019d been through both good and bad.</p><p>He has no clue how he was going to survive his final year without Phil. Phil had been there for him through every breakdown he had in university. He\u2019d quickly learned how to help Dan in such situations, and by now it\u2019s like he knew just what Dan needed even if Dan didn\u2019t know himself.</p><p><i>Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-paganda</i><br/></p><p>Dan\u2019s inner monologue was momentarily interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHow is this a road trip song?\u201d he chuckled a little.<br/></p><p>Phil didn\u2019t care if it wasn\u2019t an appropriate road trip song. If it made Dan laugh, even just a little, then it stays on the playlist.</p><p>\u201cOkay I may not be the best at making playlists that follow the theme properly,\u201d Phil giggled,\u00a0\u201cbut I like this song!\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan can\u2019t argue with Phil there, not when he looked so damn adorable with his tongue poking out as he giggled. He felt something flutter in his gut. Something he hadn\u2019t felt in a while since he sank into his darkness. He can\u2019t decide if he liked the feeling or not.</p><p>Dan can remember the times he\u2019d felt the flutter in his stomach; there weren\u2019t many before he met Phil. But with Phil, it could happen for the most random reasons and catch him off guard. Things that he never thought would affect him in the slightest would send the butterflies in his stomach into a frenzy whenever Phil did it. Like right now. All Phil was doing was laughing. He\u2019d miss that laugh very much.</p><hr><p>Two hours passed, and they reached Birmingham.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go pee,\u201d Phil said urgently as he exited the highway and drove to the nearest petrol station.<br/></p><p>They both used the restroom and Phil refilled his car\u2019s petrol. Phil got some snacks and drinks, and then he was ready to go off again. But before that, he had to check in on Dan.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d he asked softly.<br/></p><p>Dan actually was starting to crawl out of his dark hole, but Phil\u2019s question made him feel like crying. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was in a good way or not. He just wanted to adjust the stray fringe drooping across Phil\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Dan managed to answer.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you wanna go back?\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan looked at the time. It was only a quarter past five. They had plenty of time. He had plenty of Phil\u2019s time to waste.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Dan admitted quietly.<br/></p><p>Phil smiled softly,\u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go then. Oh, and please eat your burger Dan, it\u2019s probably gone cold.\u201d</p><p>Dan had almost forgotten he still had food left, but he wasn\u2019t hungry, so he\u2019ll save it for later.</p><p>Dan thought that Phil\u2019s playlist was a mess. It had lots of pop songs mixed in with some indie and rock songs, and even an edm song or two thrown in for the hell of it. But it was rather endearing how Phil just put whatever he liked. Dan, on the other hand, would have to analyse every single lyric of every song, would have to feel the correct emotions as the song plays, for it to be put in his themed playlists. He wished he could give less of a shit like Phil for these kind of things that ultimately don\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re having fun in the end.</p><p>But a few of the songs in there really made Dan think. And those were the only ones he would actually approve of being in a road trip playlist.</p><p><i>If at some point we all succumb<br/>For goodness sake let us be young<br/>Because time gets harder to outrun<br/>And I&rsquo;m nobody, I&rsquo;m not done</i><br/></p><p>Phil observed how Dan gazed far out into the fields. He thought about how Dan\u2019s mind must be running a mile a minute, just like Dan once told him when he got like this. He wished he could hear Dan\u2019s thoughts, if only so he could learn what he needs and how to help him better.</p><p>Phil very much preferred the rambly Dan over the silent Dan when he goes through tough times. Even though Dan could ramble on and on endlessly, his monologues were always so profound and Phil was always blown away by his intelligence. He loved having deep conversations with Dan. He always learned something new about Dan, their friendship, or even random facts. And he felt special that Dan was willing to open up to him so much.</p><p>But Dan was in a quiet mood now, and he\u2019ll respect that even if it was killing him to know what Dan was thinking.</p><p>He recalled the first time Dan had a breakdown in their room. Frankly, Phil was afraid because he really hadn\u2019t known what he could do to help. He\u2019d listened to his friend speak out all his worries that he\u2019d bottled up, and tried to calm him down, but it took about a week for Dan to feel like himself again.</p><p><i>We all got old at breakneck speed<br/>Slow it down, go easy on me<br/></i></p><p>Phil thought about how when he met Dan, the teen was so shy and reserved, but as they grew closer and older together, he got to know just how amazing, kind hearted and intelligent he is.</p><p>He started thinking about all the moments that they\u2019ve shared over the years in university. Not just big events, but even little everyday moments. Things that don\u2019t seem special when done with other friends were greatly cherished when it was with Dan.</p><p>He remembered how after Dan spent the night crying over his overdue assignment that caused his first breakdown, he\u2019d ordered McDonalds for their supper. Dan hadn\u2019t eaten the entire day, and still refused to eat. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what Dan would like, so he just ordered randomly. A quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. They\u2019d sat on their floor, Dan slowly eating his food while Phil talked animatedly about the squirrels and pigeons he saw on the way to campus. Just going on and on about trivial matters in the hopes of making Dan smile.</p><p>And they\u2019ve had plenty of late night suppers over the years. Not all sad of course. Most were actually times they stayed up playing video games. Some nights were spent celebrating little victories like completing essays or passing a quiz. Phil was an introvert himself who didn\u2019t really enjoy going out partying all the time, so he was delighted to have gotten a roommate who felt the same and wouldn\u2019t judge him for turning down a night out. While their coursemates celebrated the end of exams in clubs, Dan and Phil would just have a quiet night in their room with a bottle of wine shared between them. Phil had quickly realised that he didn\u2019t care about making more friends or hanging out with other people, he just wanted to be with Dan.</p><p>Phil thought about how they\u2019d skip lectures just to hang out as if they don\u2019t already see enough of each other in their room. How they\u2019d sleep in after a movie marathon the whole night. How they\u2019d mess up the entire pantry every time they tried to cook. How their study sessions in the library almost always ended up in some funny competition to get the other person to make a noise without getting caught. He was going to miss all those little moments, maybe even more so than the big events they went through together.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t believe that 3 years with Dan flew by so quickly. He\u2019d had some of the best times of his life with him, and they\u2019d been through some of their toughest together. He sighed inaudibly when he realised just how much he\u2019ll miss Dan when he graduates.</p><hr><p>They soon drove past Slough. Phil wondered if they should stop by London, but Dan didn\u2019t seem interested in stopping at all. Dan had dozed off for about half an hour, and when he got up his mood still didn\u2019t seem to improve much. He did, however, start eating his burger.</p><p>Dan was peacefully eating but stopped when he realised they were in Slough.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re driving me home,\u201d he pleaded.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo no I\u2019m not,\u201d Phil reassured him, trying not to read too much into how betrayed Dan sounded.<br/></p><p><i>Cause it&rsquo;s cold outside, when you coming home<br/>Cause it&rsquo;s hot inside, isn&rsquo;t that enough</i><br/></p><p>Phil loved going home. He was always homesick in university, that is until he met Dan. After Dan came into his life he still always wanted to go home of course, but less because he couldn\u2019t cope living away from family and more because he was just always so eager to share with his family stories about him and Dan and their little adventures.</p><p>He\u2019d even brought Dan home during a holiday once, because Dan didn\u2019t want to go back to his own home and Phil couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving Dan to spend his holiday alone in campus. His family had loved Dan, and even though Dan was nervous at first, Phil was happy to see how quickly he warmed up to them. Since then, Dan actually spent more holidays with Phil\u2019s family than his own.</p><p>Phil never could quite empathise with Dan not liking going home. He did drive Dan back home for a holiday once, and Dan\u2019s family seemed loving and welcoming. Dan had explained to him how his hometown was just filled with bad memories for him. Phil hoped that one day Dan would be able to overcome his past.</p><p>Dan visibly relaxed into his seat after Phil reassured him. He looked warily at the sign and the road exiting the highway and leading into his hometown. Dan recalled the first time he followed Phil home for the holidays, after much persuasion from Phil. His mom had sounded really upset over the phone when he informed her he wasn\u2019t going home. But besides the guilt for upsetting his mom, Dan had had the most fun in years. He felt a lump in his throat as he thought about having to spend the holidays alone in campus after Phil graduates. He couldn\u2019t possibly invite himself to Phil\u2019s anymore, can he.</p><p>The evening sun gave off a beautiful golden gleam on the horizon. Through the side view mirror, Dan could see the golden hour making his skin glow, despite his eyebags and dark eye circles.<br/></p><p><i>Fascination ends<br/>Here we go again</i><br/></p><p>He turned to Phil. The sun brought out the colours of his eyes perfectly. Dan thought that Phil\u2019s eyes were magical, with the way they seemed to change shades under the light. He even told Phil once just how mesmerising he found his eyes to be.</p><p>Phil would smile at Dan every time Dan turned to him. Dan took the moment to appreciate how the golden hues from the sun blended with the green-blue of Phil\u2019s eyes. And then he realised that those eyes were looking back at his own tired, dull ones. Dan never imagined that he\u2019d let himself look so disheveled in front of someone so perfect.</p><p>Dan decided to pay attention to Phil\u2019s playlist instead of letting his mind fixate again. The beat of the music was throbbing.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m not in love<br/>I&rsquo;m not in love<br/>I&rsquo;m not in love</i></p><p>The already propulsive synths become unavoidably sweeping as the singer\u2019s declaration sounds shakier each time he repeats it, as if it was getting harder and harder to convince himself the truth of the words he sang. Dan felt the singer\u2019s emotional vulnerability in his bones, and it wasn\u2019t helping him to stop fixating at all. In fact it did the complete opposite.</p><p>He\u2019d never been in a relationship. Neither had Phil. It was a common topic between them - quiet conversations about how they both hope to find love one day. The kind of love that is unconditional, that won\u2019t fade out but grow stronger as time goes on and they understand their partners better. But Dan wasn\u2019t so sure that life could be such a fairytale. Who could love him unconditionally when he was so broken?</p><p>He recalled one conversation they had about what they looked for in a partner, and both of them listed characteristics that actually matched each other. Dan wasn\u2019t sure if it was him overthinking that or if it was a coincidence, but Phil didn\u2019t seem to connect the dots, so Dan had concluded that it was just him and repressed it.</p><p>And how was he meant to know what love felt like anyway? Were the butterflies in his stomach a sign or are those just short-lived feelings? Where\u2019s the line that crosses between merely caring for someone and actually being in love with them and when do you know that you\u2019ve crossed it?</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and wondered if being in love was meant to hurt.</p><p>Phil was alarmed when he turned to Dan and noticed that Dan was tearing up. One moment Dan was just gazing at him passively and the next it seemed that he was trembling slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Dan?\u201d he voiced his concern.<br/></p><p>Dan wanted to respond, but he knew that if he allowed himself so much as to say one word, he\u2019d start bawling, or throwing up his burger. He swallowed thickly, forcing himself to nod his head.</p><p>Phil knew by now that Dan was lying, but he also knew not to push Dan too hard if he didn\u2019t want to speak. He knew that Dan would tell him in time. So he just reassured Dan that he\u2019ll be there to listen if Dan decides to talk.</p><p>Dan nodded again, turning to look out the window instead. He blinked furiously, not letting his tears fall. He watched the horses running along the fields to calm himself down.</p><p>Realisation is always the easy part. It\u2019s the acceptance after that that is harder to conquer. Denial would be more tempting, but Dan knows that won\u2019t be good for him in the long run. He\u2019d burst eventually; all his bottled up emotions will overflow as regret takes over and he could no longer deny his feelings.</p><p>But how was he to accept? Deep down, he knew that he\u2019d realised long ago, and that he was quietly in denial all along. Because what other option does he have?</p><p>Phil only had a month left before graduating. Before packing up all his stuff in their room and moving out to start the new chapter in his life. And leave this chapter behind, with Dan in it.</p><p>Dan had trouble enough accepting that his best friend was leaving soon, how was he supposed to accept the fact that he had feelings for him? And how was he supposed to admit it if the feelings weren\u2019t mutual?</p><p><i>We are not in love<br/>We are not in love<br/>We are not in love<br/>We are not in love</i><br/></p><p>Actually Dan wasn\u2019t sure if it was mutual or not. Sometimes he would catch Phil looking at him in a way that Dan can\u2019t find the words to describe, but it would make his heart skip a beat. Their friends always turned heads whenever Phil invited Dan to his home for the holidays. Phil would almost always rather be with Dan than anyone else, even if he\u2019d already spent the entire week alone with him, but Dan doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s just being nice to him or if he\u2019s that introverted. Dan wasn\u2019t able to discern if Phil was just a super caring friend or if he went out of his way for Dan all the time because he actually loved him back. Where is that line?</p><p>But the nasty thought at the back of his mind told him that he\u2019s overthinking all those little moments. There\u2019s no way Phil could love him back, especially when he\u2019s more often a burden than a friend. Like right now, when Phil could be resting or completing his assignment, but he\u2019s out here doing the best he can to help Dan feel better instead.</p><p>Dan looked at the road signs. They were only less than an hour away from Brighton. He wondered what Phil would do next to help him once the road ends. He needed to start feeling better, for Phil\u2019s sake.</p><hr><p>When they reached Brighton, Phil drove to a less touristy part of the beach and parked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get ice cream,\u201d he said, his smile reaching his eyes.<br/></p><p>When Dan didn\u2019t answer immediately, Phil tried again.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, we gotta at least get out and stretch!! We\u2019ve been cooped up in here too long.\u201d<br/></p><p>So Dan agreed, and his knees cracked as he stood up outside the car. Phil stretched his arms and sides, sighing in contentment.</p><p>They could hear the waves and smell the salty waters of the English Channel. The sun was going lower on the horizon, the golden hour making the seaside even more beautiful than the plains.</p><p>Dan quietly followed Phil to the nearest ice cream shop. Phil walked so close that their hands brushed, and even as Dan blushed, he could tell that Phil didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>The look on Phil\u2019s face when he got his ice cream was almost enough to make Dan forget his plight. Phil\u2019s smile was contagious, and Dan found himself smiling a little as well while they walked to a quieter part of the beach to enjoy their ice cream.</p><p>Phil plopped himself down on the pebbles, and Dan sat a little more gracefully. Phil sighed happily. It took him little to be happy. All he needed was his best friend by his side, a good ice cream and the beautiful sunset as the waves crashed in front of them. He licked his salted caramel ice cream.</p><p>When he turned to Dan, to no surprise, Dan was offering him his ice cream. Phil smiled and tasted his friend\u2019s strawberry ice cream before letting him taste his too. Phil\u2019s smile faltered a bit when he realised just how much he\u2019s going to miss peaceful moments like this with Dan. He had to cherish them while they last.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Phil checked in again.<br/></p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Dan said honestly.\u00a0Now that his mind was clearer on what\u2019s been bugging him recently and now that he\u2019d accepted his feelings, he did feel better. He felt like he didn\u2019t need to numb his emotions anymore. He was free from his dark hole, if just for this moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I\u2019m glad the road trip worked,\u201d Phil said cheerfully.<br/></p><p>Dan felt a somewhat bittersweet feeling. The crashing of the waves and the seagulls above them were the only sounds breaking their peaceful silence. A couple of people strolled by occasionally, and there were some kids running along the coast with their dogs. Dan thought about how fortunate he was, that he could be anywhere in the world with anyone, but fate placed him with Phil watching the sunset by the beach. He did not want to think about how different his life and his university experience would\u2019ve been if Phil didn\u2019t end up as his roommate.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan said in a small voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Phil smiled as he ate the last bit of his ice cream cone. He scooted closer to his friend.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the road trip, or the ice cream,\u201d Dan explained, sensing that Phil didn\u2019t quite understand.<br/></p><p>Phil tilted his head a little, indicating that he\u2019s listening for Dan to continue.</p><p>\u201cThank you, for driving all the way here. For always being so patient and understanding with me, and dealing with my shit. Even if you don\u2019t get why I think certain things the way I do, like how a drive could help me, you still do them anyway for me. You didn\u2019t have to waste your money or time but you\u2019re so selfless like that and just. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Phil was caught off-guard. Dan did show him appreciation whenever he helped him out of his episodes, but he never really said it with such raw emotion before. Dan\u2019s voice cracked, wavered as he spoke. Phil wanted to say that it\u2019s fine, he was always more than happy to help, but Dan wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cThank you for. For knowing what I need when even <i>I</i> don\u2019t know what I need. I don\u2019t know how you do that. And thank you for all the times you stood by me when you could\u2019ve gone to your other friends, and for never leaving me alone. For-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, your ice cream,\u201d Phil interrupted.<br/></p><p>Dan\u2019s ice cream was melting down his fingers, but he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for making me <i>feel</i>. When I feel nothing at all, when I\u2019m too numb, you just show up and be <i>you</i> and I feel alive again?\u201d Dan wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019s making sense now.</p><p>His vision was blurring. He\u2019d spent countless nights with Phil just talking about how he felt all the time, but he\u2019d never really spoken at length about just how much he appreciated Phil. Phil deserved to know what an amazing friend he is, and Dan was now frustrated for not letting Phil know it enough.\u00a0But he felt vulnerable as he continued speaking, like he\u2019s finally opening all of himself up for Phil to see.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do without you, Phil,\u201d Dan whispered into his melted ice cream, trembling as he finally let his tears flow free.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh Dan&hellip;\u201d Phil whispered, quickly wiping the ice cream off Dan\u2019s messy hand with a napkin.</p><p>He then pulled his shaking friend into a tight hug, bracketing his legs around Dan\u2019s thighs and effectively removing any space between them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown so much in the years I\u2019ve known you, and I know that you\u2019re gonna do just fine,\u201d Phil rubbed his hand on Dan\u2019s back as he spoke into Dan\u2019s ear.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you so much,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice cracked again.</p><p>Phil tucked Dan\u2019s head under his chin. Dan fisted at Phil\u2019s shirt as he let his tears fall onto Phil\u2019s chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you too, more than you imagine,\u201d Phil started tearing up too.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s alright, Dan, because we still have a month before I graduate,\u201d Phil said as he pulled away from Dan and lifted his chin so he could look him in the eyes,\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll never forget you or leave you behind after uni.\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan looked up and saw nothing but sincerity and certainty in Phil\u2019s eyes. He almost dared himself to believe that nothing would change after Phil was done with uni. But he knows that that\u2019s impossible. Especially if he tells Phil his true feelings.</p><p>He was still afraid of how Phil would react. This could ruin everything they had, but Dan was willing to take the risk. He\u2019d gone too many sleepless nights just thinking and denying and bottling up everything about how he felt for Phil. He reckoned that now more than ever was a good time to admit it and then seek closure no matter the outcome.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d Dan whispered almost bitterly.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Phil knitted his brows.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d<br/></p><p>Phil patiently waited. Gave Dan time to voice out what he had in mind. He gently carded his hand through Dan\u2019s matted curls.</p><p>Dan breathed in deep. Phil running his hand on his scalp helped him calm down but also made him more afraid to continue speaking. It could possibly be the final touch of affection he\u2019d ever get from Phil, and he wanted it to last.</p><p>When he couldn\u2019t drag it out any longer, he dared himself to look Phil in the eyes as he said his next few words.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you, Phil.\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan felt like a huge weight lifted off his shoulders, but felt his throat and chest tighten up at the same time. He felt free of the secret that\u2019s been eating him up, but the seconds that passed waiting for Phil to respond were filled with dread. He wanted to look away, too ashamed of possibly ruining their friendship, but he couldn\u2019t because Phil\u2019s intense gaze was locked on to his.</p><p>As Dan spoke those words with such a painful honesty in his voice, Phil felt as if his heart stopped. He\u2019d never imagined Dan ever saying those words to him. He always thought that he\u2019d been overreacting when things Dan did made his breath hitch, or his stomach come alive with butterflies. He always thought Dan was just super affectionate and would be the same with other friends too. He always liked to think he was special, even if he knew he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>But now that Dan has said it, it confirmed that his gut feelings were right after all. All those times he refused to admit to himself that he may be falling for his roommate suddenly seemed so silly. The pain in Dan\u2019s eyes made it seem like he had been so afraid of admitting this, as if he was expecting Phil to run away in disgust. Phil wanted to fix that immediately.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Dan, I never thought you\u2019d feel the same.\u201d<br/></p><p>Dan blinked, not sure if he heard Phil right. There\u2019s no way Phil felt the same for him. The setting sun made the gold-blue of Phil\u2019s eyes glisten beautifully and Dan watched as tears slowly start to fall down Phil\u2019s cheeks, mirroring his.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Dan.\u00a0There\u2019s no one I\u2019ve ever cared for as much as I do for you,\u201d Phil said brokenly, trying to breathe properly through his crying.</p><p>Dan was still in a state of shock. He let himself be wrapped by Phil\u2019s arms as he took in Phil\u2019s words. He was prepared to be left at the beach by a repulsed ex-roommate. But here he was instead, loosely hugging Phil\u2019s waist while being in Phil\u2019s warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou&hellip;?\u201d was all Dan answered.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, Dan, I wasn\u2019t ever gonna say it because I thought you never felt the same,\u201d Phil said, laughing a little at how silly that sounds now.<br/></p><p>Phil couldn\u2019t stop crying from joy, he didn\u2019t even know he could cry from happiness this much. He hugged Dan tighter, never wanting to let go.</p><p>Dan shook his head in disbelief. Slowly, his lips turned up into a smile. And for the first time in a while, he smiled a genuine smile, finally feeling truly happy.</p><p>\u201cThe whole week&hellip; it was because of this?\u201d Phil said, pulling back from the hug but holding onto Dan\u2019s shoulders.<br/></p><p>\u201c&hellip;yeah, I\u2019m in love with you but I didn\u2019t want to ruin the friendship we already have,\u201d Dan admitted, finding it so easy to say it now that Phil\u2019s said it too. He felt like he didn\u2019t ever want to stop saying it now.<br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re like this,\u201d Phil laughed.<br/></p><p>Dan laughed too. In hindsight, they both know each other so well already, so they should\u2019ve seen this coming. They should\u2019ve known and trusted their instincts, but who would\u2019ve known that they were both too scared to admit the same thoughts all this while.</p><p>They sat there laughing for a while, at how unreal it was that this was how they found out. That this was how they realised they were in love. And in love with each other. Sitting by the beach miles away from where they first met, in front of a beautiful sunset. All because Dan was too numb to feel after feeling too much.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, Dan, I\u2019ll never leave you. Not after graduation, not ever for as long as you want me by your side,\u201d Phil said, cupping Dan\u2019s cheeks and thumbing away the stray tears.<br/></p><p>\u201cForever sounds good,\u201d Dan whispered as he smiled up at Phil.<br/></p><p>It felt like it happened in slow motion but too fast at the same time, when they both instinctively moved closer. Dan could feel Phil\u2019s breath on his nose but his mind barely had time to register what was happening before he was closing his eyes and feeling Phil\u2019s lips against his.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s waist as they kissed. He felt his heart soar right out of his dark abyss. Phil\u2019s hands never left his cheeks, and his lips felt like home. Dan found comfort in this strange sense of familiarity in the new beginning upon them.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t count the number of times he\u2019d wished he could kiss Dan on his hands. His heart was beating rapidly as he pressed his lips against Dan\u2019s, he can\u2019t believe he was finally getting his wish. It felt right, like they were meant to fit each other. Dan\u2019s lips was soft against his, and he thinks that he could never get enough of it.</p><p>They pulled back when they needed air. Phil could finally see the life in Dan\u2019s eyes again. The sun was almost completely set, but the last few rays it was leaving behind illuminated the hazel in Dan\u2019s eyes. Phil thought that he looked absolutely beautiful, wet cheeks and all.</p><p>Dan\u2019s mind was still running a mile a minute, but with all good thoughts now. He wondered what this now means for them, where they\u2019d be headed from now on. But they would figure things out. He knew they\u2019d be by each other\u2019s side through anything just like they\u2019d always been, and that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>\u201cAre we going back now?\u201d he asked, feeling Phil\u2019s breath against his lips.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only just got here, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d Phil said, unable to contain his smile.</p><hr><p>songs featured from Phil\u2019s road trip playlist:</p><p>Rebellion (Lies) - Arcade Fire</p><p>Propaganda - Muse</p><p>Wetsuit - The Vaccines</p><p>Not In Love - Crystal Castles</p><p> (in order, new song after each line break except Propaganda)<br/></p><p>-</p><p>do tell me what you think! :) maybe I could try venturing into more non-smut, or maybe I should stick to smut only lmao</p>",

The only thing worse than sinking again is letting Phil see him sink again. He had tried. He\u2019d tried to be better, stay better for the sake of Phil. If only so he wouldn\u2019t have to see concern and worry and even sadness pool in those bright blue eyes. But sometimes he just couldn\u2019t help falling back into the dark abyss of emptiness. What else could he do if everything is pointless anyways.</p><p>Dan felt the edge of his bed dip. He shut his eyes, not wanting to face the world. Not wanting to face his roommate and the fact that he\u2019s a disappointment for letting his roommate down again. He knows Phil would never blame him, but deep down he blames himself for causing Phil so much worry.</p><p>Gentle hands pulled the blanket off his face. Dan blinked up, regretting it instantly when he saw Phil\u2019s brows crease.</p><p>Phil hated seeing him like this. He knew that behind that lifeless stare was a warm hazel, full of wonder and awe. He loved seeing those eyes look back at him with excitement when they skip lectures for a movie, how they twinkle with hope when Phil assures him that everything will be fine in times when he couldn\u2019t see anything positive in his future. Or in times when he couldn\u2019t see himself even having a future at all.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br></p><p>Whenever Dan was in this dark part of his mind, he just felt numb and emotionless. But Phil could simply say two words and suddenly his eyes stung with tears, his heart beat with fury and he felt too much all at once.</p><p>He wanted to answer Phil, wanted to yell at him, wanted to disappear. But he didn\u2019t have the energy for any of that. All he could do was shrug and shut his eyes again.</p><p>Phil brushed away the curl that was covering Dan\u2019s forehead. Dan can\u2019t remember the last time he had a haircut, and he was sure that his messy tangled curls were definitely an unruly sight.</p><p>\u201cCould you try to get up for me please? I know you haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday and we should have lunch now,\u201d Phil spoke softly, his words so full of care that Dan can\u2019t deny his requests even if he wanted to.<br></p><p>Dan felt like his whole body was protesting as he tried to sit up. He\u2019d been in bed since yesterday afternoon, and judging from Phil returning from school, it was probably past noon now. Still it didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d had any rest at all. His mouth felt dry, but he didn\u2019t have the appetite to eat or even drink.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not hungry,\u201d was all Dan managed to mumble out.<br></p><p>Phil bit his lip as he thought of how to coax Dan out of his bed. He knew that Dan always tried his best for him, even if he felt too exhausted to do anything. But he also didn\u2019t want to push Dan too hard when he got like this. He took Dan\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>Dan stared at his hand being sandwiched between Phil\u2019s. Phil felt so warm around his cold hand. He slowly looked up at Phil quizzically.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a drive,\u201d Phil suggested softly.<br></p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t a good driver; failed twice before finally getting his license and then never making use of it for a year after getting it despite having a car that was gifted to him by his parents for finally passing. Dan knew this and joked about how he would never risk his life being Phil\u2019s passenger. But there was one day when Dan was falling into the darkness again, and he said something that stuck to Phil.</p><p>Dan talked about how he just wanted to feel free. The kind of freedom where he wouldn\u2019t have to think about any responsibility he had, any failures or people he\u2019d disappointed. The kind of freedom that he knew was temporary, but forgetting about his past and future to live in the moment would help him feel at peace even if just for a while until his mind was clear enough again to face his problems.</p><p>And Dan talked about how he\u2019d feel that kind of fleeting freedom when he went on road trips. The vast fields and open skies as far as he could see down the never-ending road ahead gave him a sense of liberty. It shows him how big the world is, and how small his problems are in contrast. That there is so much more to life and what the world has to offer than his own worries and anxiety. And when he sees it that way, he\u2019ll get more confident in trying to overcome his problems, instead of letting them eat him up instead.</p><p>Since then, Phil actually started practising his driving more. Dan was skeptical at first, but Phil insisted on driving him to campus one day. Dan thought he\u2019d fear for his life, but it ended up being a really pleasant ride and he never made fun of his driving ever again.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Dan mumbled, staring at Phil\u2019s thumb tracing circles on his hand.<br></p><p>\u201cAnywhere. Nowhere, it doesn\u2019t matter. But let\u2019s just get out of here for a while,\u201d Phil said, hoping for Dan to agree.<br></p><p>When Dan looked back up at Phil, all Phil could see was a cold, despondent stare that he was determined to bring warmth back into.</p><p>Dan\u2019s whole body felt heavy, it was screaming at him to go back under the covers. But he looked at Phil, looked at his hopeful smile and his encouraging eyes. He already felt enough of a disappointment, he just couldn\u2019t disappoint his best friend any further.\u00a0</p><p>So Dan gave a small nod, making Phil\u2019s whole face light up.\u00a0</p><p>Phil quickly got up and grabbed a few pieces of clothing for both of them, shoving them into his backpack. Just in case. He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d need to drive before Dan felt better again.\u00a0</p><p>When he was done packing, he turned back to Dan whose eyebrows were knitted together as he looked at him. He was probably wondering why Phil needed to pack, but he didn\u2019t voice it out.\u00a0</p><p>Phil came back to Dan\u2019s bed and held onto Dan\u2019s hands again. He gently pulled Dan up, and Dan pliantly allowed his body to be moved as Phil pleased.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Phil said excitedly, never letting go of Dan\u2019s hand as he dragged his friend out of their room.<br></p><hr><p>Dan immediately shut his eyes once he got settled in the car. The sun was blinding, and he felt like it was sucking whatever little energy he had left out of him. He just wanted to sleep. He trusted Phil to keep them both safe as he drove to wherever.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan in dismay. He hoped that his plan would work, he just had to give Dan time. He was feeling hungry, having missed breakfast to attend his morning lecture and missed lunch to get back to Dan as soon as he could. So he decided to get them both food first.</p><p>Phil could tell that Dan wasn\u2019t asleep because every now and then he would peek an eye open just to see where they were. So Phil knew that he wouldn\u2019t be disturbing Dan if he filled the silence with music.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brain was demanding him to sleep but shouting at him about all his worries at the same time. But through the loudness of his mind, he could still hear the song Phil started playing.\u00a0<br></p><p><i>Sleeping is giving in<br>No matter what the time is<br>Sleeping is giving in<br>So lift those heavy eyelids</i><br></p><p>The lyrics hit Dan, and he opened his eyes and looked at Phil. He wondered if Phil chose the song on purpose.</p><p>\u201cOh sorry did you wanna sleep? I can turn it off-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d Dan interrupted,\u00a0\u201cbut what are you playing?\u201d<br></p><p>Phil tried to hide his joy. That was the most he\u2019d heard his best friend speak at once in the past few days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my road trip playlist!\u201d he responded excitedly.<br></p><p><i>People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya<br>Come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour</i><br></p><p>Dan grunted in what he hoped Phil understood as an approval before facing away from him again. He leaned against the window, staring blankly at the cars passing by. He thought about how his dreams could save him, if only they were attainable.</p><p>Dan had zoned out after that, liking the buzz in his head more than the song forcing him to be self-aware. But as Phil slowed into a driveway, he tuned back into the present.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ya wanna get?\u201d Phil asked, stopping behind a queue of cars.<br></p><p>Dan looked around and realised that Phil had entered a McDonalds drive-thru.</p><p>Dan shrugged,\u00a0\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Dan knew that Phil knows Dan\u2019s go-to order at McDonalds anyway. And Phil knew that Dan knew that, but he was just trying to get Dan to talk.</p><p>A few minutes later, Phil was shoving a big bag onto Dan\u2019s lap. The aroma of the food did stir Dan\u2019s stomach up. It growled as Dan salivated. The thing about sinking into the darkness was that even if he was hungry, he\u2019d be too preoccupied with fighting against the demons in his head to realise. But with the food now right on his lap, he suddenly couldn\u2019t wait to eat. He looked over at Phil.</p><p>Phil smiled at him, it was the first time that day that Dan\u2019s gaze was more than just a blank, dead one. Phil thought he looked kinda cute all wide-eyed silently asking if he could eat.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead! I\u2019ll find somewhere to park first,\u201d he said as he drove into the carpark.</p><p>Dan looked into the bag. Phil had gotten him a quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. Just as he liked it. He grabbed a couple of fries and started munching on them first.</p><p>When Phil was parked, they took their food out and laid it out as best as they could on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cHow come we used the drive thru just to sit at the carpark?\u201d Dan mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cWell I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to enter the place with the crowd in there and all\u2026\u201d Phil rationalised.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Dan mused,\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have liked that. Thanks.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil smiled, glad he did make the right choice. He started digging into his big mac, but kept a watchful eye on Dan to make sure he ate too.</p><p>Dan was still slowly munching on his fries. When he noticed that Phil was glancing over at him, he wordlessly offered Phil some of his fries.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I got my own,\u201d Phil said with his mouth still full.<br></p><p>But Dan insisted, bringing the fries in his fingers closer to Phil\u2019s face. Phil\u2019s giggle was stifled when the fries were pushed into his mouth. Phil smiled as he chewed, happy that his friend was slowly feeling okay enough to show affection again. Dan didn\u2019t even seem bothered that his fingertips were caught between Phil\u2019s lips.</p><p>Dan quite liked feeding Phil. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly why, but he always got a sense of joy whenever he let his friend have a bite of his pizza, or fed him a forkful of pasta, or tilted his drink for Phil to take a sip. And it was nice to feel something other than emptiness as he fed Phil his fries this time.</p><p>Phil was aware how Dan liked to feed him when he was being in a cheeky mood. Dan didn\u2019t seem to be doing this to be cheeky this time, but Phil was happy it\u2019s happening all the same, and he\u2019d accept however much food being fed to him to make his friend happy.</p><p>Dan alternated between eating his fries and giving some to Phil. He liked how Phil didn\u2019t question him or make him stop, but just accepted his offer every time. When he eventually ran out of fries, he wiped his hand clean and looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou not gonna eat your burger?\u201d Phil asked, wiping his mouth as he finished his own food.<br></p><p>Dan busied himself looking at a couple of kids laughing and running into the restaurant. Oh what fun it is to be young and free. He shook his head no.</p><p>Phil\u2019s shoulders drooped a little. He\u2019d thought that Dan was starting to feel better.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m full already,\u201d Dan answered,\u00a0\u201cmaybe later.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil responded softly.<br></p><p>Phil started the car and slowly went out of the driveway.\u00a0He drove aimlessly. He didn\u2019t have a proper destination in mind, and he didn\u2019t really care how long he\u2019d have to drive or where they ended up as long as they were together and he\u2019d have his Dan by the end of it. He saw the sign saying they were leaving Manchester, and decided to just continue driving south.</p><p>Phil\u2019s road trip playlist started again, but the songs didn\u2019t hit home as much as the first one, so Dan asked him to restart it.</p><p><i>People try and hide the light<br>Underneath the covers</i><br></p><p>Dan stared out the window most of the ride. The weather was the opposite of his gloomy mood. The late afternoon sun was beaming down on them. He saw cows and sheep grazing lazily on the open fields. The clouds looked beautiful against the blue sky. For a fleeting moment, Dan let himself believe that life <i>can</i> be beautiful. He grabbed his milkshake, overwhelmed by the sudden thought. Perhaps the milkshake can give him a brain freeze that would numb him from overthinking for a while.</p><p><i>Now here\u2019s the sun, it\u2019s alright<br>Lies, lies</i><br></p><p>Dan appreciated that Phil didn\u2019t try to force a conversation out of him. Phil knew that he needed his space even while he needed someone to be there for him at the same time. He never thought anyone would get that, but Phil does. Phil understands him so well that it scares him as much as it comforts him sometimes. He sipped on his milkshake harder.</p><p>The song ended, Phil\u2019s playlist moving on to a more upbeat pop song. Phil tapped along to the song on his steering wheel, humming at the chorus. Dan looked over at his friend. Phil seemed so content to just drive. Drive for no reason other than for Dan to clear his mind. Although it was his petrol and his time of day that Dan was wasting.</p><p>Phil looked back over just then, and smiled at Dan. Dan pursed his lips into a forced smile, even though he meant it in a genuine way. He just couldn\u2019t understand why Phil would care for him this much.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you driving?\u201d<br></p><p>Phil\u2019s brows creased together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI mean, why are you doing this? Don\u2019t you have that assignment due soon? And your petrol-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about any of that Dan, you know I\u2019m always here for you. I want to help you feel better, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Dan gulped. The sincerity in Phil\u2019s voice scared him. He didn\u2019t feel like he deserved such attention and care from anyone. He turned back to facing the road ahead. The unending path taking them to anywhere, nowhere. Taking them to wherever it is that Dan will supposedly feel better, before heading back.</p><p>Dan\u2019s reaction worried Phil a little. He was afraid that Dan might\u2019ve changed his mind about this road trip. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a good idea all along, and Dan was just following along because he felt like he had to.</p><p>\u201cWe could always go back if you want?\u201d Phil asked tentatively.<br></p><p>Dan looked surprised for a second, but he shook his head almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like this. Thank you,\u201d Dan murmured.<br></p><p>He wished he could show his gratitude better. Maybe when he felt better he\u2019d repay Phil somehow.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna go back at any time just tell me, alright?\u201d Phil asked, still a little worried.<br></p><p>Dan nodded, proceeding to sip on his milkshake.</p><p>They fell into comfortable silence again. If only Dan\u2019s mind could match the silence between them.</p><p>Dan started thinking about his latest episode and the main thing on his mind. A lot of times, his mood plummeted for almost no reason at all, but sometimes he\u2019d have a clearer understanding of why it happened. Especially if his mind won\u2019t stop reminding him about his main worry at the moment.</p><p>He stole glances at Phil. Phil, his roommate of 3 years since his first day of university. Phil, who quickly became his best friend. Phil, a year his senior who would be graduating in about a month. Phil, who had been by his side through everything he\u2019d been through both good and bad.</p><p>He has no clue how he was going to survive his final year without Phil. Phil had been there for him through every breakdown he had in university. He\u2019d quickly learned how to help Dan in such situations, and by now it\u2019s like he knew just what Dan needed even if Dan didn\u2019t know himself.</p><p><i>Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-paganda</i><br></p><p>Dan\u2019s inner monologue was momentarily interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHow is this a road trip song?\u201d he chuckled a little.<br></p><p>Phil didn\u2019t care if it wasn\u2019t an appropriate road trip song. If it made Dan laugh, even just a little, then it stays on the playlist.</p><p>\u201cOkay I may not be the best at making playlists that follow the theme properly,\u201d Phil giggled,\u00a0\u201cbut I like this song!\u201d<br></p><p>Dan can\u2019t argue with Phil there, not when he looked so damn adorable with his tongue poking out as he giggled. He felt something flutter in his gut. Something he hadn\u2019t felt in a while since he sank into his darkness. He can\u2019t decide if he liked the feeling or not.</p><p>Dan can remember the times he\u2019d felt the flutter in his stomach; there weren\u2019t many before he met Phil. But with Phil, it could happen for the most random reasons and catch him off guard. Things that he never thought would affect him in the slightest would send the butterflies in his stomach into a frenzy whenever Phil did it. Like right now. All Phil was doing was laughing. He\u2019d miss that laugh very much.</p><hr><p>Two hours passed, and they reached Birmingham.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go pee,\u201d Phil said urgently as he exited the highway and drove to the nearest petrol station.<br></p><p>They both used the restroom and Phil refilled his car\u2019s petrol. Phil got some snacks and drinks, and then he was ready to go off again. But before that, he had to check in on Dan.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d he asked softly.<br></p><p>Dan actually was starting to crawl out of his dark hole, but Phil\u2019s question made him feel like crying. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was in a good way or not. He just wanted to adjust the stray fringe drooping across Phil\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Dan managed to answer.<br></p><p>\u201cSo you wanna go back?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan looked at the time. It was only a quarter past five. They had plenty of time. He had plenty of Phil\u2019s time to waste.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Dan admitted quietly.<br></p><p>Phil smiled softly,\u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go then. Oh, and please eat your burger Dan, it\u2019s probably gone cold.\u201d</p><p>Dan had almost forgotten he still had food left, but he wasn\u2019t hungry, so he\u2019ll save it for later.</p><p>Dan thought that Phil\u2019s playlist was a mess. It had lots of pop songs mixed in with some indie and rock songs, and even an edm song or two thrown in for the hell of it. But it was rather endearing how Phil just put whatever he liked. Dan, on the other hand, would have to analyse every single lyric of every song, would have to feel the correct emotions as the song plays, for it to be put in his themed playlists. He wished he could give less of a shit like Phil for these kind of things that ultimately don\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re having fun in the end.</p><p>But a few of the songs in there really made Dan think. And those were the only ones he would actually approve of being in a road trip playlist.</p><p><i>If at some point we all succumb<br>For goodness sake let us be young<br>Because time gets harder to outrun<br>And I\u2019m nobody, I\u2019m not done</i><br></p><p>Phil observed how Dan gazed far out into the fields. He thought about how Dan\u2019s mind must be running a mile a minute, just like Dan once told him when he got like this. He wished he could hear Dan\u2019s thoughts, if only so he could learn what he needs and how to help him better.</p><p>Phil very much preferred the rambly Dan over the silent Dan when he goes through tough times. Even though Dan could ramble on and on endlessly, his monologues were always so profound and Phil was always blown away by his intelligence. He loved having deep conversations with Dan. He always learned something new about Dan, their friendship, or even random facts. And he felt special that Dan was willing to open up to him so much.</p><p>But Dan was in a quiet mood now, and he\u2019ll respect that even if it was killing him to know what Dan was thinking.</p><p>He recalled the first time Dan had a breakdown in their room. Frankly, Phil was afraid because he really hadn\u2019t known what he could do to help. He\u2019d listened to his friend speak out all his worries that he\u2019d bottled up, and tried to calm him down, but it took about a week for Dan to feel like himself again.</p><p><i>We all got old at breakneck speed<br>Slow it down, go easy on me<br></i></p><p>Phil thought about how when he met Dan, the teen was so shy and reserved, but as they grew closer and older together, he got to know just how amazing, kind hearted and intelligent he is.</p><p>He started thinking about all the moments that they\u2019ve shared over the years in university. Not just big events, but even little everyday moments. Things that don\u2019t seem special when done with other friends were greatly cherished when it was with Dan.</p><p>He remembered how after Dan spent the night crying over his overdue assignment that caused his first breakdown, he\u2019d ordered McDonalds for their supper. Dan hadn\u2019t eaten the entire day, and still refused to eat. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what Dan would like, so he just ordered randomly. A quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. They\u2019d sat on their floor, Dan slowly eating his food while Phil talked animatedly about the squirrels and pigeons he saw on the way to campus. Just going on and on about trivial matters in the hopes of making Dan smile.</p><p>And they\u2019ve had plenty of late night suppers over the years. Not all sad of course. Most were actually times they stayed up playing video games. Some nights were spent celebrating little victories like completing essays or passing a quiz. Phil was an introvert himself who didn\u2019t really enjoy going out partying all the time, so he was delighted to have gotten a roommate who felt the same and wouldn\u2019t judge him for turning down a night out. While their coursemates celebrated the end of exams in clubs, Dan and Phil would just have a quiet night in their room with a bottle of wine shared between them. Phil had quickly realised that he didn\u2019t care about making more friends or hanging out with other people, he just wanted to be with Dan.</p><p>Phil thought about how they\u2019d skip lectures just to hang out as if they don\u2019t already see enough of each other in their room. How they\u2019d sleep in after a movie marathon the whole night. How they\u2019d mess up the entire pantry every time they tried to cook. How their study sessions in the library almost always ended up in some funny competition to get the other person to make a noise without getting caught. He was going to miss all those little moments, maybe even more so than the big events they went through together.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t believe that 3 years with Dan flew by so quickly. He\u2019d had some of the best times of his life with him, and they\u2019d been through some of their toughest together. He sighed inaudibly when he realised just how much he\u2019ll miss Dan when he graduates.</p><hr><p>They soon drove past Slough. Phil wondered if they should stop by London, but Dan didn\u2019t seem interested in stopping at all. Dan had dozed off for about half an hour, and when he got up his mood still didn\u2019t seem to improve much. He did, however, start eating his burger.</p><p>Dan was peacefully eating but stopped when he realised they were in Slough.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re driving me home,\u201d he pleaded.<br></p><p>\u201cNo no I\u2019m not,\u201d Phil reassured him, trying not to read too much into how betrayed Dan sounded.<br></p><p><i>Cause it\u2019s cold outside, when you coming home<br>Cause it\u2019s hot inside, isn\u2019t that enough</i><br></p><p>Phil loved going home. He was always homesick in university, that is until he met Dan. After Dan came into his life he still always wanted to go home of course, but less because he couldn\u2019t cope living away from family and more because he was just always so eager to share with his family stories about him and Dan and their little adventures.</p><p>He\u2019d even brought Dan home during a holiday once, because Dan didn\u2019t want to go back to his own home and Phil couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving Dan to spend his holiday alone in campus. His family had loved Dan, and even though Dan was nervous at first, Phil was happy to see how quickly he warmed up to them. Since then, Dan actually spent more holidays with Phil\u2019s family than his own.</p><p>Phil never could quite empathise with Dan not liking going home. He did drive Dan back home for a holiday once, and Dan\u2019s family seemed loving and welcoming. Dan had explained to him how his hometown was just filled with bad memories for him. Phil hoped that one day Dan would be able to overcome his past.</p><p>Dan visibly relaxed into his seat after Phil reassured him. He looked warily at the sign and the road exiting the highway and leading into his hometown. Dan recalled the first time he followed Phil home for the holidays, after much persuasion from Phil. His mom had sounded really upset over the phone when he informed her he wasn\u2019t going home. But besides the guilt for upsetting his mom, Dan had had the most fun in years. He felt a lump in his throat as he thought about having to spend the holidays alone in campus after Phil graduates. He couldn\u2019t possibly invite himself to Phil\u2019s anymore, can he.</p><p>The evening sun gave off a beautiful golden gleam on the horizon. Through the side view mirror, Dan could see the golden hour making his skin glow, despite his eyebags and dark eye circles.<br></p><p><i>Fascination ends<br>Here we go again</i><br></p><p>He turned to Phil. The sun brought out the colours of his eyes perfectly. Dan thought that Phil\u2019s eyes were magical, with the way they seemed to change shades under the light. He even told Phil once just how mesmerising he found his eyes to be.</p><p>Phil would smile at Dan every time Dan turned to him. Dan took the moment to appreciate how the golden hues from the sun blended with the green-blue of Phil\u2019s eyes. And then he realised that those eyes were looking back at his own tired, dull ones. Dan never imagined that he\u2019d let himself look so disheveled in front of someone so perfect.</p><p>Dan decided to pay attention to Phil\u2019s playlist instead of letting his mind fixate again. The beat of the music was throbbing.</p><p><i>I\u2019m not in love<br>I\u2019m not in love<br>I\u2019m not in love</i></p><p>The already propulsive synths become unavoidably sweeping as the singer\u2019s declaration sounds shakier each time he repeats it, as if it was getting harder and harder to convince himself the truth of the words he sang. Dan felt the singer\u2019s emotional vulnerability in his bones, and it wasn\u2019t helping him to stop fixating at all. In fact it did the complete opposite.</p><p>He\u2019d never been in a relationship. Neither had Phil. It was a common topic between them - quiet conversations about how they both hope to find love one day. The kind of love that is unconditional, that won\u2019t fade out but grow stronger as time goes on and they understand their partners better. But Dan wasn\u2019t so sure that life could be such a fairytale. Who could love him unconditionally when he was so broken?</p><p>He recalled one conversation they had about what they looked for in a partner, and both of them listed characteristics that actually matched each other. Dan wasn\u2019t sure if it was him overthinking that or if it was a coincidence, but Phil didn\u2019t seem to connect the dots, so Dan had concluded that it was just him and repressed it.</p><p>And how was he meant to know what love felt like anyway? Were the butterflies in his stomach a sign or are those just short-lived feelings? Where\u2019s the line that crosses between merely caring for someone and actually being in love with them and when do you know that you\u2019ve crossed it?</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and wondered if being in love was meant to hurt.</p><p>Phil was alarmed when he turned to Dan and noticed that Dan was tearing up. One moment Dan was just gazing at him passively and the next it seemed that he was trembling slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Dan?\u201d he voiced his concern.<br></p><p>Dan wanted to respond, but he knew that if he allowed himself so much as to say one word, he\u2019d start bawling, or throwing up his burger. He swallowed thickly, forcing himself to nod his head.</p><p>Phil knew by now that Dan was lying, but he also knew not to push Dan too hard if he didn\u2019t want to speak. He knew that Dan would tell him in time. So he just reassured Dan that he\u2019ll be there to listen if Dan decides to talk.</p><p>Dan nodded again, turning to look out the window instead. He blinked furiously, not letting his tears fall. He watched the horses running along the fields to calm himself down.</p><p>Realisation is always the easy part. It\u2019s the acceptance after that that is harder to conquer. Denial would be more tempting, but Dan knows that won\u2019t be good for him in the long run. He\u2019d burst eventually; all his bottled up emotions will overflow as regret takes over and he could no longer deny his feelings.</p><p>But how was he to accept? Deep down, he knew that he\u2019d realised long ago, and that he was quietly in denial all along. Because what other option does he have?</p><p>Phil only had a month left before graduating. Before packing up all his stuff in their room and moving out to start the new chapter in his life. And leave this chapter behind, with Dan in it.</p><p>Dan had trouble enough accepting that his best friend was leaving soon, how was he supposed to accept the fact that he had feelings for him? And how was he supposed to admit it if the feelings weren\u2019t mutual?</p><p><i>We are not in love<br>We are not in love<br>We are not in love<br>We are not in love</i><br></p><p>Actually Dan wasn\u2019t sure if it was mutual or not. Sometimes he would catch Phil looking at him in a way that Dan can\u2019t find the words to describe, but it would make his heart skip a beat. Their friends always turned heads whenever Phil invited Dan to his home for the holidays. Phil would almost always rather be with Dan than anyone else, even if he\u2019d already spent the entire week alone with him, but Dan doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s just being nice to him or if he\u2019s that introverted. Dan wasn\u2019t able to discern if Phil was just a super caring friend or if he went out of his way for Dan all the time because he actually loved him back. Where is that line?</p><p>But the nasty thought at the back of his mind told him that he\u2019s overthinking all those little moments. There\u2019s no way Phil could love him back, especially when he\u2019s more often a burden than a friend. Like right now, when Phil could be resting or completing his assignment, but he\u2019s out here doing the best he can to help Dan feel better instead.</p><p>Dan looked at the road signs. They were only less than an hour away from Brighton. He wondered what Phil would do next to help him once the road ends. He needed to start feeling better, for Phil\u2019s sake.</p><hr><p>When they reached Brighton, Phil drove to a less touristy part of the beach and parked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get ice cream,\u201d he said, his smile reaching his eyes.<br></p><p>When Dan didn\u2019t answer immediately, Phil tried again.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, we gotta at least get out and stretch!! We\u2019ve been cooped up in here too long.\u201d<br></p><p>So Dan agreed, and his knees cracked as he stood up outside the car. Phil stretched his arms and sides, sighing in contentment.</p><p>They could hear the waves and smell the salty waters of the English Channel. The sun was going lower on the horizon, the golden hour making the seaside even more beautiful than the plains.</p><p>Dan quietly followed Phil to the nearest ice cream shop. Phil walked so close that their hands brushed, and even as Dan blushed, he could tell that Phil didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>The look on Phil\u2019s face when he got his ice cream was almost enough to make Dan forget his plight. Phil\u2019s smile was contagious, and Dan found himself smiling a little as well while they walked to a quieter part of the beach to enjoy their ice cream.</p><p>Phil plopped himself down on the pebbles, and Dan sat a little more gracefully. Phil sighed happily. It took him little to be happy. All he needed was his best friend by his side, a good ice cream and the beautiful sunset as the waves crashed in front of them. He licked his salted caramel ice cream.</p><p>When he turned to Dan, to no surprise, Dan was offering him his ice cream. Phil smiled and tasted his friend\u2019s strawberry ice cream before letting him taste his too. Phil\u2019s smile faltered a bit when he realised just how much he\u2019s going to miss peaceful moments like this with Dan. He had to cherish them while they last.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Phil checked in again.<br></p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Dan said honestly.\u00a0Now that his mind was clearer on what\u2019s been bugging him recently and now that he\u2019d accepted his feelings, he did feel better. He felt like he didn\u2019t need to numb his emotions anymore. He was free from his dark hole, if just for this moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I\u2019m glad the road trip worked,\u201d Phil said cheerfully.<br></p><p>Dan felt a somewhat bittersweet feeling. The crashing of the waves and the seagulls above them were the only sounds breaking their peaceful silence. A couple of people strolled by occasionally, and there were some kids running along the coast with their dogs. Dan thought about how fortunate he was, that he could be anywhere in the world with anyone, but fate placed him with Phil watching the sunset by the beach. He did not want to think about how different his life and his university experience would\u2019ve been if Phil didn\u2019t end up as his roommate.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan said in a small voice.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Phil smiled as he ate the last bit of his ice cream cone. He scooted closer to his friend.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the road trip, or the ice cream,\u201d Dan explained, sensing that Phil didn\u2019t quite understand.<br></p><p>Phil tilted his head a little, indicating that he\u2019s listening for Dan to continue.</p><p>\u201cThank you, for driving all the way here. For always being so patient and understanding with me, and dealing with my shit. Even if you don\u2019t get why I think certain things the way I do, like how a drive could help me, you still do them anyway for me. You didn\u2019t have to waste your money or time but you\u2019re so selfless like that and just. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Phil was caught off-guard. Dan did show him appreciation whenever he helped him out of his episodes, but he never really said it with such raw emotion before. Dan\u2019s voice cracked, wavered as he spoke. Phil wanted to say that it\u2019s fine, he was always more than happy to help, but Dan wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cThank you for. For knowing what I need when even <i>I</i> don\u2019t know what I need. I don\u2019t know how you do that. And thank you for all the times you stood by me when you could\u2019ve gone to your other friends, and for never leaving me alone. For-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, your ice cream,\u201d Phil interrupted.<br></p><p>Dan\u2019s ice cream was melting down his fingers, but he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for making me <i>feel</i>. When I feel nothing at all, when I\u2019m too numb, you just show up and be <i>you</i> and I feel alive again?\u201d Dan wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019s making sense now.</p><p>His vision was blurring. He\u2019d spent countless nights with Phil just talking about how he felt all the time, but he\u2019d never really spoken at length about just how much he appreciated Phil. Phil deserved to know what an amazing friend he is, and Dan was now frustrated for not letting Phil know it enough.\u00a0But he felt vulnerable as he continued speaking, like he\u2019s finally opening all of himself up for Phil to see.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do without you, Phil,\u201d Dan whispered into his melted ice cream, trembling as he finally let his tears flow free.<br></p><p>\u201cOh Dan\u2026\u201d Phil whispered, quickly wiping the ice cream off Dan\u2019s messy hand with a napkin.</p><p>He then pulled his shaking friend into a tight hug, bracketing his legs around Dan\u2019s thighs and effectively removing any space between them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown so much in the years I\u2019ve known you, and I know that you\u2019re gonna do just fine,\u201d Phil rubbed his hand on Dan\u2019s back as he spoke into Dan\u2019s ear.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you so much,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice cracked again.</p><p>Phil tucked Dan\u2019s head under his chin. Dan fisted at Phil\u2019s shirt as he let his tears fall onto Phil\u2019s chest.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you too, more than you imagine,\u201d Phil started tearing up too.<br></p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s alright, Dan, because we still have a month before I graduate,\u201d Phil said as he pulled away from Dan and lifted his chin so he could look him in the eyes,\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll never forget you or leave you behind after uni.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan looked up and saw nothing but sincerity and certainty in Phil\u2019s eyes. He almost dared himself to believe that nothing would change after Phil was done with uni. But he knows that that\u2019s impossible. Especially if he tells Phil his true feelings.</p><p>He was still afraid of how Phil would react. This could ruin everything they had, but Dan was willing to take the risk. He\u2019d gone too many sleepless nights just thinking and denying and bottling up everything about how he felt for Phil. He reckoned that now more than ever was a good time to admit it and then seek closure no matter the outcome.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d Dan whispered almost bitterly.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Phil knitted his brows.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil patiently waited. Gave Dan time to voice out what he had in mind. He gently carded his hand through Dan\u2019s matted curls.</p><p>Dan breathed in deep. Phil running his hand on his scalp helped him calm down but also made him more afraid to continue speaking. It could possibly be the final touch of affection he\u2019d ever get from Phil, and he wanted it to last.</p><p>When he couldn\u2019t drag it out any longer, he dared himself to look Phil in the eyes as he said his next few words.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you, Phil.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan felt like a huge weight lifted off his shoulders, but felt his throat and chest tighten up at the same time. He felt free of the secret that\u2019s been eating him up, but the seconds that passed waiting for Phil to respond were filled with dread. He wanted to look away, too ashamed of possibly ruining their friendship, but he couldn\u2019t because Phil\u2019s intense gaze was locked on to his.</p><p>As Dan spoke those words with such a painful honesty in his voice, Phil felt as if his heart stopped. He\u2019d never imagined Dan ever saying those words to him. He always thought that he\u2019d been overreacting when things Dan did made his breath hitch, or his stomach come alive with butterflies. He always thought Dan was just super affectionate and would be the same with other friends too. He always liked to think he was special, even if he knew he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>But now that Dan has said it, it confirmed that his gut feelings were right after all. All those times he refused to admit to himself that he may be falling for his roommate suddenly seemed so silly. The pain in Dan\u2019s eyes made it seem like he had been so afraid of admitting this, as if he was expecting Phil to run away in disgust. Phil wanted to fix that immediately.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Dan, I never thought you\u2019d feel the same.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan blinked, not sure if he heard Phil right. There\u2019s no way Phil felt the same for him. The setting sun made the gold-blue of Phil\u2019s eyes glisten beautifully and Dan watched as tears slowly start to fall down Phil\u2019s cheeks, mirroring his.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Dan.\u00a0There\u2019s no one I\u2019ve ever cared for as much as I do for you,\u201d Phil said brokenly, trying to breathe properly through his crying.</p><p>Dan was still in a state of shock. He let himself be wrapped by Phil\u2019s arms as he took in Phil\u2019s words. He was prepared to be left at the beach by a repulsed ex-roommate. But here he was instead, loosely hugging Phil\u2019s waist while being in Phil\u2019s warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026?\u201d was all Dan answered.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, Dan, I wasn\u2019t ever gonna say it because I thought you never felt the same,\u201d Phil said, laughing a little at how silly that sounds now.<br></p><p>Phil couldn\u2019t stop crying from joy, he didn\u2019t even know he could cry from happiness this much. He hugged Dan tighter, never wanting to let go.</p><p>Dan shook his head in disbelief. Slowly, his lips turned up into a smile. And for the first time in a while, he smiled a genuine smile, finally feeling truly happy.</p><p>\u201cThe whole week\u2026 it was because of this?\u201d Phil said, pulling back from the hug but holding onto Dan\u2019s shoulders.<br></p><p>\u201c\u2026yeah, I\u2019m in love with you but I didn\u2019t want to ruin the friendship we already have,\u201d Dan admitted, finding it so easy to say it now that Phil\u2019s said it too. He felt like he didn\u2019t ever want to stop saying it now.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re like this,\u201d Phil laughed.<br></p><p>Dan laughed too. In hindsight, they both know each other so well already, so they should\u2019ve seen this coming. They should\u2019ve known and trusted their instincts, but who would\u2019ve known that they were both too scared to admit the same thoughts all this while.</p><p>They sat there laughing for a while, at how unreal it was that this was how they found out. That this was how they realised they were in love. And in love with each other. Sitting by the beach miles away from where they first met, in front of a beautiful sunset. All because Dan was too numb to feel after feeling too much.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, Dan, I\u2019ll never leave you. Not after graduation, not ever for as long as you want me by your side,\u201d Phil said, cupping Dan\u2019s cheeks and thumbing away the stray tears.<br></p><p>\u201cForever sounds good,\u201d Dan whispered as he smiled up at Phil.<br></p><p>It felt like it happened in slow motion but too fast at the same time, when they both instinctively moved closer. Dan could feel Phil\u2019s breath on his nose but his mind barely had time to register what was happening before he was closing his eyes and feeling Phil\u2019s lips against his.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s waist as they kissed. He felt his heart soar right out of his dark abyss. Phil\u2019s hands never left his cheeks, and his lips felt like home. Dan found comfort in this strange sense of familiarity in the new beginning upon them.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t count the number of times he\u2019d wished he could kiss Dan on his hands. His heart was beating rapidly as he pressed his lips against Dan\u2019s, he can\u2019t believe he was finally getting his wish. It felt right, like they were meant to fit each other. Dan\u2019s lips was soft against his, and he thinks that he could never get enough of it.</p><p>They pulled back when they needed air. Phil could finally see the life in Dan\u2019s eyes again. The sun was almost completely set, but the last few rays it was leaving behind illuminated the hazel in Dan\u2019s eyes. Phil thought that he looked absolutely beautiful, wet cheeks and all.</p><p>Dan\u2019s mind was still running a mile a minute, but with all good thoughts now. He wondered what this now means for them, where they\u2019d be headed from now on. But they would figure things out. He knew they\u2019d be by each other\u2019s side through anything just like they\u2019d always been, and that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>\u201cAre we going back now?\u201d he asked, feeling Phil\u2019s breath against his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only just got here, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d Phil said, unable to contain his smile.</p><hr><p>songs featured from Phil\u2019s road trip playlist:</p><p>Rebellion (Lies) - Arcade Fire</p><p>Propaganda - Muse</p><p>Wetsuit - The Vaccines</p><p>Not In Love - Crystal Castles</p><p> (in order, new song after each line break except Propaganda)<br></p><p>-</p><p>do tell me what you think! :) maybe I could try venturing into more non-smut, or maybe I should stick to smut only lmao</p></p>",

The only thing worse than sinking again is letting Phil see him sink again. He had tried. He\u2019d tried to be better, stay better for the sake of Phil. If only so he wouldn\u2019t have to see concern and worry and even sadness pool in those bright blue eyes. But sometimes he just couldn\u2019t help falling back into the dark abyss of emptiness. What else could he do if everything is pointless anyways.</p><p>Dan felt the edge of his bed dip. He shut his eyes, not wanting to face the world. Not wanting to face his roommate and the fact that he\u2019s a disappointment for letting his roommate down again. He knows Phil would never blame him, but deep down he blames himself for causing Phil so much worry.</p><p>Gentle hands pulled the blanket off his face. Dan blinked up, regretting it instantly when he saw Phil\u2019s brows crease.</p><p>Phil hated seeing him like this. He knew that behind that lifeless stare was a warm hazel, full of wonder and awe. He loved seeing those eyes look back at him with excitement when they skip lectures for a movie, how they twinkle with hope when Phil assures him that everything will be fine in times when he couldn\u2019t see anything positive in his future. Or in times when he couldn\u2019t see himself even having a future at all.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br></p><p>Whenever Dan was in this dark part of his mind, he just felt numb and emotionless. But Phil could simply say two words and suddenly his eyes stung with tears, his heart beat with fury and he felt too much all at once.</p><p>He wanted to answer Phil, wanted to yell at him, wanted to disappear. But he didn\u2019t have the energy for any of that. All he could do was shrug and shut his eyes again.</p><p>Phil brushed away the curl that was covering Dan\u2019s forehead. Dan can\u2019t remember the last time he had a haircut, and he was sure that his messy tangled curls were definitely an unruly sight.</p><p>\u201cCould you try to get up for me please? I know you haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday and we should have lunch now,\u201d Phil spoke softly, his words so full of care that Dan can\u2019t deny his requests even if he wanted to.<br></p><p>Dan felt like his whole body was protesting as he tried to sit up. He\u2019d been in bed since yesterday afternoon, and judging from Phil returning from school, it was probably past noon now. Still it didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d had any rest at all. His mouth felt dry, but he didn\u2019t have the appetite to eat or even drink.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not hungry,\u201d was all Dan managed to mumble out.<br></p><p>Phil bit his lip as he thought of how to coax Dan out of his bed. He knew that Dan always tried his best for him, even if he felt too exhausted to do anything. But he also didn\u2019t want to push Dan too hard when he got like this. He took Dan\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>Dan stared at his hand being sandwiched between Phil\u2019s. Phil felt so warm around his cold hand. He slowly looked up at Phil quizzically.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for a drive,\u201d Phil suggested softly.<br></p><p>Phil wasn\u2019t a good driver; failed twice before finally getting his license and then never making use of it for a year after getting it despite having a car that was gifted to him by his parents for finally passing. Dan knew this and joked about how he would never risk his life being Phil\u2019s passenger. But there was one day when Dan was falling into the darkness again, and he said something that stuck to Phil.</p><p>Dan talked about how he just wanted to feel free. The kind of freedom where he wouldn\u2019t have to think about any responsibility he had, any failures or people he\u2019d disappointed. The kind of freedom that he knew was temporary, but forgetting about his past and future to live in the moment would help him feel at peace even if just for a while until his mind was clear enough again to face his problems.</p><p>And Dan talked about how he\u2019d feel that kind of fleeting freedom when he went on road trips. The vast fields and open skies as far as he could see down the never-ending road ahead gave him a sense of liberty. It shows him how big the world is, and how small his problems are in contrast. That there is so much more to life and what the world has to offer than his own worries and anxiety. And when he sees it that way, he\u2019ll get more confident in trying to overcome his problems, instead of letting them eat him up instead.</p><p>Since then, Phil actually started practising his driving more. Dan was skeptical at first, but Phil insisted on driving him to campus one day. Dan thought he\u2019d fear for his life, but it ended up being a really pleasant ride and he never made fun of his driving ever again.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Dan mumbled, staring at Phil\u2019s thumb tracing circles on his hand.<br></p><p>\u201cAnywhere. Nowhere, it doesn\u2019t matter. But let\u2019s just get out of here for a while,\u201d Phil said, hoping for Dan to agree.<br></p><p>When Dan looked back up at Phil, all Phil could see was a cold, despondent stare that he was determined to bring warmth back into.</p><p>Dan\u2019s whole body felt heavy, it was screaming at him to go back under the covers. But he looked at Phil, looked at his hopeful smile and his encouraging eyes. He already felt enough of a disappointment, he just couldn\u2019t disappoint his best friend any further.\u00a0</p><p>So Dan gave a small nod, making Phil\u2019s whole face light up.\u00a0</p><p>Phil quickly got up and grabbed a few pieces of clothing for both of them, shoving them into his backpack. Just in case. He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d need to drive before Dan felt better again.\u00a0</p><p>When he was done packing, he turned back to Dan whose eyebrows were knitted together as he looked at him. He was probably wondering why Phil needed to pack, but he didn\u2019t voice it out.\u00a0</p><p>Phil came back to Dan\u2019s bed and held onto Dan\u2019s hands again. He gently pulled Dan up, and Dan pliantly allowed his body to be moved as Phil pleased.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Phil said excitedly, never letting go of Dan\u2019s hand as he dragged his friend out of their room.<br></p><hr><p>Dan immediately shut his eyes once he got settled in the car. The sun was blinding, and he felt like it was sucking whatever little energy he had left out of him. He just wanted to sleep. He trusted Phil to keep them both safe as he drove to wherever.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan in dismay. He hoped that his plan would work, he just had to give Dan time. He was feeling hungry, having missed breakfast to attend his morning lecture and missed lunch to get back to Dan as soon as he could. So he decided to get them both food first.</p><p>Phil could tell that Dan wasn\u2019t asleep because every now and then he would peek an eye open just to see where they were. So Phil knew that he wouldn\u2019t be disturbing Dan if he filled the silence with music.</p><p>Dan\u2019s brain was demanding him to sleep but shouting at him about all his worries at the same time. But through the loudness of his mind, he could still hear the song Phil started playing.\u00a0<br></p><p><i>Sleeping is giving in<br>No matter what the time is<br>Sleeping is giving in<br>So lift those heavy eyelids</i><br></p><p>The lyrics hit Dan, and he opened his eyes and looked at Phil. He wondered if Phil chose the song on purpose.</p><p>\u201cOh sorry did you wanna sleep? I can turn it off-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d Dan interrupted,\u00a0\u201cbut what are you playing?\u201d<br></p><p>Phil tried to hide his joy. That was the most he\u2019d heard his best friend speak at once in the past few days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my road trip playlist!\u201d he responded excitedly.<br></p><p><i>People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya<br>Come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour</i><br></p><p>Dan grunted in what he hoped Phil understood as an approval before facing away from him again. He leaned against the window, staring blankly at the cars passing by. He thought about how his dreams could save him, if only they were attainable.</p><p>Dan had zoned out after that, liking the buzz in his head more than the song forcing him to be self-aware. But as Phil slowed into a driveway, he tuned back into the present.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ya wanna get?\u201d Phil asked, stopping behind a queue of cars.<br></p><p>Dan looked around and realised that Phil had entered a McDonalds drive-thru.</p><p>Dan shrugged,\u00a0\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Dan knew that Phil knows Dan\u2019s go-to order at McDonalds anyway. And Phil knew that Dan knew that, but he was just trying to get Dan to talk.</p><p>A few minutes later, Phil was shoving a big bag onto Dan\u2019s lap. The aroma of the food did stir Dan\u2019s stomach up. It growled as Dan salivated. The thing about sinking into the darkness was that even if he was hungry, he\u2019d be too preoccupied with fighting against the demons in his head to realise. But with the food now right on his lap, he suddenly couldn\u2019t wait to eat. He looked over at Phil.</p><p>Phil smiled at him, it was the first time that day that Dan\u2019s gaze was more than just a blank, dead one. Phil thought he looked kinda cute all wide-eyed silently asking if he could eat.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead! I\u2019ll find somewhere to park first,\u201d he said as he drove into the carpark.</p><p>Dan looked into the bag. Phil had gotten him a quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. Just as he liked it. He grabbed a couple of fries and started munching on them first.</p><p>When Phil was parked, they took their food out and laid it out as best as they could on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cHow come we used the drive thru just to sit at the carpark?\u201d Dan mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cWell I thought you wouldn\u2019t want to enter the place with the crowd in there and all\u2026\u201d Phil rationalised.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Dan mused,\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have liked that. Thanks.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil smiled, glad he did make the right choice. He started digging into his big mac, but kept a watchful eye on Dan to make sure he ate too.</p><p>Dan was still slowly munching on his fries. When he noticed that Phil was glancing over at him, he wordlessly offered Phil some of his fries.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I got my own,\u201d Phil said with his mouth still full.<br></p><p>But Dan insisted, bringing the fries in his fingers closer to Phil\u2019s face. Phil\u2019s giggle was stifled when the fries were pushed into his mouth. Phil smiled as he chewed, happy that his friend was slowly feeling okay enough to show affection again. Dan didn\u2019t even seem bothered that his fingertips were caught between Phil\u2019s lips.</p><p>Dan quite liked feeding Phil. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly why, but he always got a sense of joy whenever he let his friend have a bite of his pizza, or fed him a forkful of pasta, or tilted his drink for Phil to take a sip. And it was nice to feel something other than emptiness as he fed Phil his fries this time.</p><p>Phil was aware how Dan liked to feed him when he was being in a cheeky mood. Dan didn\u2019t seem to be doing this to be cheeky this time, but Phil was happy it\u2019s happening all the same, and he\u2019d accept however much food being fed to him to make his friend happy.</p><p>Dan alternated between eating his fries and giving some to Phil. He liked how Phil didn\u2019t question him or make him stop, but just accepted his offer every time. When he eventually ran out of fries, he wiped his hand clean and looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou not gonna eat your burger?\u201d Phil asked, wiping his mouth as he finished his own food.<br></p><p>Dan busied himself looking at a couple of kids laughing and running into the restaurant. Oh what fun it is to be young and free. He shook his head no.</p><p>Phil\u2019s shoulders drooped a little. He\u2019d thought that Dan was starting to feel better.</p><p>\u201c\u2019m full already,\u201d Dan answered,\u00a0\u201cmaybe later.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil responded softly.<br></p><p>Phil started the car and slowly went out of the driveway.\u00a0He drove aimlessly. He didn\u2019t have a proper destination in mind, and he didn\u2019t really care how long he\u2019d have to drive or where they ended up as long as they were together and he\u2019d have his Dan by the end of it. He saw the sign saying they were leaving Manchester, and decided to just continue driving south.</p><p>Phil\u2019s road trip playlist started again, but the songs didn\u2019t hit home as much as the first one, so Dan asked him to restart it.</p><p><i>People try and hide the light<br>Underneath the covers</i><br></p><p>Dan stared out the window most of the ride. The weather was the opposite of his gloomy mood. The late afternoon sun was beaming down on them. He saw cows and sheep grazing lazily on the open fields. The clouds looked beautiful against the blue sky. For a fleeting moment, Dan let himself believe that life <i>can</i> be beautiful. He grabbed his milkshake, overwhelmed by the sudden thought. Perhaps the milkshake can give him a brain freeze that would numb him from overthinking for a while.</p><p><i>Now here\u2019s the sun, it\u2019s alright<br>Lies, lies</i><br></p><p>Dan appreciated that Phil didn\u2019t try to force a conversation out of him. Phil knew that he needed his space even while he needed someone to be there for him at the same time. He never thought anyone would get that, but Phil does. Phil understands him so well that it scares him as much as it comforts him sometimes. He sipped on his milkshake harder.</p><p>The song ended, Phil\u2019s playlist moving on to a more upbeat pop song. Phil tapped along to the song on his steering wheel, humming at the chorus. Dan looked over at his friend. Phil seemed so content to just drive. Drive for no reason other than for Dan to clear his mind. Although it was his petrol and his time of day that Dan was wasting.</p><p>Phil looked back over just then, and smiled at Dan. Dan pursed his lips into a forced smile, even though he meant it in a genuine way. He just couldn\u2019t understand why Phil would care for him this much.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you driving?\u201d<br></p><p>Phil\u2019s brows creased together.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI mean, why are you doing this? Don\u2019t you have that assignment due soon? And your petrol-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about any of that Dan, you know I\u2019m always here for you. I want to help you feel better, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Dan gulped. The sincerity in Phil\u2019s voice scared him. He didn\u2019t feel like he deserved such attention and care from anyone. He turned back to facing the road ahead. The unending path taking them to anywhere, nowhere. Taking them to wherever it is that Dan will supposedly feel better, before heading back.</p><p>Dan\u2019s reaction worried Phil a little. He was afraid that Dan might\u2019ve changed his mind about this road trip. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a good idea all along, and Dan was just following along because he felt like he had to.</p><p>\u201cWe could always go back if you want?\u201d Phil asked tentatively.<br></p><p>Dan looked surprised for a second, but he shook his head almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like this. Thank you,\u201d Dan murmured.<br></p><p>He wished he could show his gratitude better. Maybe when he felt better he\u2019d repay Phil somehow.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna go back at any time just tell me, alright?\u201d Phil asked, still a little worried.<br></p><p>Dan nodded, proceeding to sip on his milkshake.</p><p>They fell into comfortable silence again. If only Dan\u2019s mind could match the silence between them.</p><p>Dan started thinking about his latest episode and the main thing on his mind. A lot of times, his mood plummeted for almost no reason at all, but sometimes he\u2019d have a clearer understanding of why it happened. Especially if his mind won\u2019t stop reminding him about his main worry at the moment.</p><p>He stole glances at Phil. Phil, his roommate of 3 years since his first day of university. Phil, who quickly became his best friend. Phil, a year his senior who would be graduating in about a month. Phil, who had been by his side through everything he\u2019d been through both good and bad.</p><p>He has no clue how he was going to survive his final year without Phil. Phil had been there for him through every breakdown he had in university. He\u2019d quickly learned how to help Dan in such situations, and by now it\u2019s like he knew just what Dan needed even if Dan didn\u2019t know himself.</p><p><i>Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-paganda</i><br></p><p>Dan\u2019s inner monologue was momentarily interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHow is this a road trip song?\u201d he chuckled a little.<br></p><p>Phil didn\u2019t care if it wasn\u2019t an appropriate road trip song. If it made Dan laugh, even just a little, then it stays on the playlist.</p><p>\u201cOkay I may not be the best at making playlists that follow the theme properly,\u201d Phil giggled,\u00a0\u201cbut I like this song!\u201d<br></p><p>Dan can\u2019t argue with Phil there, not when he looked so damn adorable with his tongue poking out as he giggled. He felt something flutter in his gut. Something he hadn\u2019t felt in a while since he sank into his darkness. He can\u2019t decide if he liked the feeling or not.</p><p>Dan can remember the times he\u2019d felt the flutter in his stomach; there weren\u2019t many before he met Phil. But with Phil, it could happen for the most random reasons and catch him off guard. Things that he never thought would affect him in the slightest would send the butterflies in his stomach into a frenzy whenever Phil did it. Like right now. All Phil was doing was laughing. He\u2019d miss that laugh very much.</p><hr><p>Two hours passed, and they reached Birmingham.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go pee,\u201d Phil said urgently as he exited the highway and drove to the nearest petrol station.<br></p><p>They both used the restroom and Phil refilled his car\u2019s petrol. Phil got some snacks and drinks, and then he was ready to go off again. But before that, he had to check in on Dan.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d he asked softly.<br></p><p>Dan actually was starting to crawl out of his dark hole, but Phil\u2019s question made him feel like crying. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was in a good way or not. He just wanted to adjust the stray fringe drooping across Phil\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Dan managed to answer.<br></p><p>\u201cSo you wanna go back?\u201d<br></p><p>Dan looked at the time. It was only a quarter past five. They had plenty of time. He had plenty of Phil\u2019s time to waste.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Dan admitted quietly.<br></p><p>Phil smiled softly,\u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go then. Oh, and please eat your burger Dan, it\u2019s probably gone cold.\u201d</p><p>Dan had almost forgotten he still had food left, but he wasn\u2019t hungry, so he\u2019ll save it for later.</p><p>Dan thought that Phil\u2019s playlist was a mess. It had lots of pop songs mixed in with some indie and rock songs, and even an edm song or two thrown in for the hell of it. But it was rather endearing how Phil just put whatever he liked. Dan, on the other hand, would have to analyse every single lyric of every song, would have to feel the correct emotions as the song plays, for it to be put in his themed playlists. He wished he could give less of a shit like Phil for these kind of things that ultimately don\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re having fun in the end.</p><p>But a few of the songs in there really made Dan think. And those were the only ones he would actually approve of being in a road trip playlist.</p><p><i>If at some point we all succumb<br>For goodness sake let us be young<br>Because time gets harder to outrun<br>And I\u2019m nobody, I\u2019m not done</i><br></p><p>Phil observed how Dan gazed far out into the fields. He thought about how Dan\u2019s mind must be running a mile a minute, just like Dan once told him when he got like this. He wished he could hear Dan\u2019s thoughts, if only so he could learn what he needs and how to help him better.</p><p>Phil very much preferred the rambly Dan over the silent Dan when he goes through tough times. Even though Dan could ramble on and on endlessly, his monologues were always so profound and Phil was always blown away by his intelligence. He loved having deep conversations with Dan. He always learned something new about Dan, their friendship, or even random facts. And he felt special that Dan was willing to open up to him so much.</p><p>But Dan was in a quiet mood now, and he\u2019ll respect that even if it was killing him to know what Dan was thinking.</p><p>He recalled the first time Dan had a breakdown in their room. Frankly, Phil was afraid because he really hadn\u2019t known what he could do to help. He\u2019d listened to his friend speak out all his worries that he\u2019d bottled up, and tried to calm him down, but it took about a week for Dan to feel like himself again.</p><p><i>We all got old at breakneck speed<br>Slow it down, go easy on me<br></i></p><p>Phil thought about how when he met Dan, the teen was so shy and reserved, but as they grew closer and older together, he got to know just how amazing, kind hearted and intelligent he is.</p><p>He started thinking about all the moments that they\u2019ve shared over the years in university. Not just big events, but even little everyday moments. Things that don\u2019t seem special when done with other friends were greatly cherished when it was with Dan.</p><p>He remembered how after Dan spent the night crying over his overdue assignment that caused his first breakdown, he\u2019d ordered McDonalds for their supper. Dan hadn\u2019t eaten the entire day, and still refused to eat. Phil wasn\u2019t sure what Dan would like, so he just ordered randomly. A quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. They\u2019d sat on their floor, Dan slowly eating his food while Phil talked animatedly about the squirrels and pigeons he saw on the way to campus. Just going on and on about trivial matters in the hopes of making Dan smile.</p><p>And they\u2019ve had plenty of late night suppers over the years. Not all sad of course. Most were actually times they stayed up playing video games. Some nights were spent celebrating little victories like completing essays or passing a quiz. Phil was an introvert himself who didn\u2019t really enjoy going out partying all the time, so he was delighted to have gotten a roommate who felt the same and wouldn\u2019t judge him for turning down a night out. While their coursemates celebrated the end of exams in clubs, Dan and Phil would just have a quiet night in their room with a bottle of wine shared between them. Phil had quickly realised that he didn\u2019t care about making more friends or hanging out with other people, he just wanted to be with Dan.</p><p>Phil thought about how they\u2019d skip lectures just to hang out as if they don\u2019t already see enough of each other in their room. How they\u2019d sleep in after a movie marathon the whole night. How they\u2019d mess up the entire pantry every time they tried to cook. How their study sessions in the library almost always ended up in some funny competition to get the other person to make a noise without getting caught. He was going to miss all those little moments, maybe even more so than the big events they went through together.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t believe that 3 years with Dan flew by so quickly. He\u2019d had some of the best times of his life with him, and they\u2019d been through some of their toughest together. He sighed inaudibly when he realised just how much he\u2019ll miss Dan when he graduates.</p><hr><p>They soon drove past Slough. Phil wondered if they should stop by London, but Dan didn\u2019t seem interested in stopping at all. Dan had dozed off for about half an hour, and when he got up his mood still didn\u2019t seem to improve much. He did, however, start eating his burger.</p><p>Dan was peacefully eating but stopped when he realised they were in Slough.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re driving me home,\u201d he pleaded.<br></p><p>\u201cNo no I\u2019m not,\u201d Phil reassured him, trying not to read too much into how betrayed Dan sounded.<br></p><p><i>Cause it\u2019s cold outside, when you coming home<br>Cause it\u2019s hot inside, isn\u2019t that enough</i><br></p><p>Phil loved going home. He was always homesick in university, that is until he met Dan. After Dan came into his life he still always wanted to go home of course, but less because he couldn\u2019t cope living away from family and more because he was just always so eager to share with his family stories about him and Dan and their little adventures.</p><p>He\u2019d even brought Dan home during a holiday once, because Dan didn\u2019t want to go back to his own home and Phil couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving Dan to spend his holiday alone in campus. His family had loved Dan, and even though Dan was nervous at first, Phil was happy to see how quickly he warmed up to them. Since then, Dan actually spent more holidays with Phil\u2019s family than his own.</p><p>Phil never could quite empathise with Dan not liking going home. He did drive Dan back home for a holiday once, and Dan\u2019s family seemed loving and welcoming. Dan had explained to him how his hometown was just filled with bad memories for him. Phil hoped that one day Dan would be able to overcome his past.</p><p>Dan visibly relaxed into his seat after Phil reassured him. He looked warily at the sign and the road exiting the highway and leading into his hometown. Dan recalled the first time he followed Phil home for the holidays, after much persuasion from Phil. His mom had sounded really upset over the phone when he informed her he wasn\u2019t going home. But besides the guilt for upsetting his mom, Dan had had the most fun in years. He felt a lump in his throat as he thought about having to spend the holidays alone in campus after Phil graduates. He couldn\u2019t possibly invite himself to Phil\u2019s anymore, can he.</p><p>The evening sun gave off a beautiful golden gleam on the horizon. Through the side view mirror, Dan could see the golden hour making his skin glow, despite his eyebags and dark eye circles.<br></p><p><i>Fascination ends<br>Here we go again</i><br></p><p>He turned to Phil. The sun brought out the colours of his eyes perfectly. Dan thought that Phil\u2019s eyes were magical, with the way they seemed to change shades under the light. He even told Phil once just how mesmerising he found his eyes to be.</p><p>Phil would smile at Dan every time Dan turned to him. Dan took the moment to appreciate how the golden hues from the sun blended with the green-blue of Phil\u2019s eyes. And then he realised that those eyes were looking back at his own tired, dull ones. Dan never imagined that he\u2019d let himself look so disheveled in front of someone so perfect.</p><p>Dan decided to pay attention to Phil\u2019s playlist instead of letting his mind fixate again. The beat of the music was throbbing.</p><p><i>I\u2019m not in love<br>I\u2019m not in love<br>I\u2019m not in love</i></p><p>The already propulsive synths become unavoidably sweeping as the singer\u2019s declaration sounds shakier each time he repeats it, as if it was getting harder and harder to convince himself the truth of the words he sang. Dan felt the singer\u2019s emotional vulnerability in his bones, and it wasn\u2019t helping him to stop fixating at all. In fact it did the complete opposite.</p><p>He\u2019d never been in a relationship. Neither had Phil. It was a common topic between them - quiet conversations about how they both hope to find love one day. The kind of love that is unconditional, that won\u2019t fade out but grow stronger as time goes on and they understand their partners better. But Dan wasn\u2019t so sure that life could be such a fairytale. Who could love him unconditionally when he was so broken?</p><p>He recalled one conversation they had about what they looked for in a partner, and both of them listed characteristics that actually matched each other. Dan wasn\u2019t sure if it was him overthinking that or if it was a coincidence, but Phil didn\u2019t seem to connect the dots, so Dan had concluded that it was just him and repressed it.</p><p>And how was he meant to know what love felt like anyway? Were the butterflies in his stomach a sign or are those just short-lived feelings? Where\u2019s the line that crosses between merely caring for someone and actually being in love with them and when do you know that you\u2019ve crossed it?</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and wondered if being in love was meant to hurt.</p><p>Phil was alarmed when he turned to Dan and noticed that Dan was tearing up. One moment Dan was just gazing at him passively and the next it seemed that he was trembling slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou alright, Dan?\u201d he voiced his concern.<br></p><p>Dan wanted to respond, but he knew that if he allowed himself so much as to say one word, he\u2019d start bawling, or throwing up his burger. He swallowed thickly, forcing himself to nod his head.</p><p>Phil knew by now that Dan was lying, but he also knew not to push Dan too hard if he didn\u2019t want to speak. He knew that Dan would tell him in time. So he just reassured Dan that he\u2019ll be there to listen if Dan decides to talk.</p><p>Dan nodded again, turning to look out the window instead. He blinked furiously, not letting his tears fall. He watched the horses running along the fields to calm himself down.</p><p>Realisation is always the easy part. It\u2019s the acceptance after that that is harder to conquer. Denial would be more tempting, but Dan knows that won\u2019t be good for him in the long run. He\u2019d burst eventually; all his bottled up emotions will overflow as regret takes over and he could no longer deny his feelings.</p><p>But how was he to accept? Deep down, he knew that he\u2019d realised long ago, and that he was quietly in denial all along. Because what other option does he have?</p><p>Phil only had a month left before graduating. Before packing up all his stuff in their room and moving out to start the new chapter in his life. And leave this chapter behind, with Dan in it.</p><p>Dan had trouble enough accepting that his best friend was leaving soon, how was he supposed to accept the fact that he had feelings for him? And how was he supposed to admit it if the feelings weren\u2019t mutual?</p><p><i>We are not in love<br>We are not in love<br>We are not in love<br>We are not in love</i><br></p><p>Actually Dan wasn\u2019t sure if it was mutual or not. Sometimes he would catch Phil looking at him in a way that Dan can\u2019t find the words to describe, but it would make his heart skip a beat. Their friends always turned heads whenever Phil invited Dan to his home for the holidays. Phil would almost always rather be with Dan than anyone else, even if he\u2019d already spent the entire week alone with him, but Dan doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he\u2019s just being nice to him or if he\u2019s that introverted. Dan wasn\u2019t able to discern if Phil was just a super caring friend or if he went out of his way for Dan all the time because he actually loved him back. Where is that line?</p><p>But the nasty thought at the back of his mind told him that he\u2019s overthinking all those little moments. There\u2019s no way Phil could love him back, especially when he\u2019s more often a burden than a friend. Like right now, when Phil could be resting or completing his assignment, but he\u2019s out here doing the best he can to help Dan feel better instead.</p><p>Dan looked at the road signs. They were only less than an hour away from Brighton. He wondered what Phil would do next to help him once the road ends. He needed to start feeling better, for Phil\u2019s sake.</p><hr><p>When they reached Brighton, Phil drove to a less touristy part of the beach and parked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get ice cream,\u201d he said, his smile reaching his eyes.<br></p><p>When Dan didn\u2019t answer immediately, Phil tried again.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, we gotta at least get out and stretch!! We\u2019ve been cooped up in here too long.\u201d<br></p><p>So Dan agreed, and his knees cracked as he stood up outside the car. Phil stretched his arms and sides, sighing in contentment.</p><p>They could hear the waves and smell the salty waters of the English Channel. The sun was going lower on the horizon, the golden hour making the seaside even more beautiful than the plains.</p><p>Dan quietly followed Phil to the nearest ice cream shop. Phil walked so close that their hands brushed, and even as Dan blushed, he could tell that Phil didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>The look on Phil\u2019s face when he got his ice cream was almost enough to make Dan forget his plight. Phil\u2019s smile was contagious, and Dan found himself smiling a little as well while they walked to a quieter part of the beach to enjoy their ice cream.</p><p>Phil plopped himself down on the pebbles, and Dan sat a little more gracefully. Phil sighed happily. It took him little to be happy. All he needed was his best friend by his side, a good ice cream and the beautiful sunset as the waves crashed in front of them. He licked his salted caramel ice cream.</p><p>When he turned to Dan, to no surprise, Dan was offering him his ice cream. Phil smiled and tasted his friend\u2019s strawberry ice cream before letting him taste his too. Phil\u2019s smile faltered a bit when he realised just how much he\u2019s going to miss peaceful moments like this with Dan. He had to cherish them while they last.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d Phil checked in again.<br></p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Dan said honestly.\u00a0Now that his mind was clearer on what\u2019s been bugging him recently and now that he\u2019d accepted his feelings, he did feel better. He felt like he didn\u2019t need to numb his emotions anymore. He was free from his dark hole, if just for this moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I\u2019m glad the road trip worked,\u201d Phil said cheerfully.<br></p><p>Dan felt a somewhat bittersweet feeling. The crashing of the waves and the seagulls above them were the only sounds breaking their peaceful silence. A couple of people strolled by occasionally, and there were some kids running along the coast with their dogs. Dan thought about how fortunate he was, that he could be anywhere in the world with anyone, but fate placed him with Phil watching the sunset by the beach. He did not want to think about how different his life and his university experience would\u2019ve been if Phil didn\u2019t end up as his roommate.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan said in a small voice.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Phil smiled as he ate the last bit of his ice cream cone. He scooted closer to his friend.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the road trip, or the ice cream,\u201d Dan explained, sensing that Phil didn\u2019t quite understand.<br></p><p>Phil tilted his head a little, indicating that he\u2019s listening for Dan to continue.</p><p>\u201cThank you, for driving all the way here. For always being so patient and understanding with me, and dealing with my shit. Even if you don\u2019t get why I think certain things the way I do, like how a drive could help me, you still do them anyway for me. You didn\u2019t have to waste your money or time but you\u2019re so selfless like that and just. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Phil was caught off-guard. Dan did show him appreciation whenever he helped him out of his episodes, but he never really said it with such raw emotion before. Dan\u2019s voice cracked, wavered as he spoke. Phil wanted to say that it\u2019s fine, he was always more than happy to help, but Dan wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cThank you for. For knowing what I need when even <i>I</i> don\u2019t know what I need. I don\u2019t know how you do that. And thank you for all the times you stood by me when you could\u2019ve gone to your other friends, and for never leaving me alone. For-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, your ice cream,\u201d Phil interrupted.<br></p><p>Dan\u2019s ice cream was melting down his fingers, but he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you for making me <i>feel</i>. When I feel nothing at all, when I\u2019m too numb, you just show up and be <i>you</i> and I feel alive again?\u201d Dan wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019s making sense now.</p><p>His vision was blurring. He\u2019d spent countless nights with Phil just talking about how he felt all the time, but he\u2019d never really spoken at length about just how much he appreciated Phil. Phil deserved to know what an amazing friend he is, and Dan was now frustrated for not letting Phil know it enough.\u00a0But he felt vulnerable as he continued speaking, like he\u2019s finally opening all of himself up for Phil to see.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do without you, Phil,\u201d Dan whispered into his melted ice cream, trembling as he finally let his tears flow free.<br></p><p>\u201cOh Dan\u2026\u201d Phil whispered, quickly wiping the ice cream off Dan\u2019s messy hand with a napkin.</p><p>He then pulled his shaking friend into a tight hug, bracketing his legs around Dan\u2019s thighs and effectively removing any space between them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown so much in the years I\u2019ve known you, and I know that you\u2019re gonna do just fine,\u201d Phil rubbed his hand on Dan\u2019s back as he spoke into Dan\u2019s ear.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you so much,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice cracked again.</p><p>Phil tucked Dan\u2019s head under his chin. Dan fisted at Phil\u2019s shirt as he let his tears fall onto Phil\u2019s chest.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you too, more than you imagine,\u201d Phil started tearing up too.<br></p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s alright, Dan, because we still have a month before I graduate,\u201d Phil said as he pulled away from Dan and lifted his chin so he could look him in the eyes,\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019ll never forget you or leave you behind after uni.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan looked up and saw nothing but sincerity and certainty in Phil\u2019s eyes. He almost dared himself to believe that nothing would change after Phil was done with uni. But he knows that that\u2019s impossible. Especially if he tells Phil his true feelings.</p><p>He was still afraid of how Phil would react. This could ruin everything they had, but Dan was willing to take the risk. He\u2019d gone too many sleepless nights just thinking and denying and bottling up everything about how he felt for Phil. He reckoned that now more than ever was a good time to admit it and then seek closure no matter the outcome.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d Dan whispered almost bitterly.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Phil knitted his brows.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d<br></p><p>Phil patiently waited. Gave Dan time to voice out what he had in mind. He gently carded his hand through Dan\u2019s matted curls.</p><p>Dan breathed in deep. Phil running his hand on his scalp helped him calm down but also made him more afraid to continue speaking. It could possibly be the final touch of affection he\u2019d ever get from Phil, and he wanted it to last.</p><p>When he couldn\u2019t drag it out any longer, he dared himself to look Phil in the eyes as he said his next few words.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you, Phil.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan felt like a huge weight lifted off his shoulders, but felt his throat and chest tighten up at the same time. He felt free of the secret that\u2019s been eating him up, but the seconds that passed waiting for Phil to respond were filled with dread. He wanted to look away, too ashamed of possibly ruining their friendship, but he couldn\u2019t because Phil\u2019s intense gaze was locked on to his.</p><p>As Dan spoke those words with such a painful honesty in his voice, Phil felt as if his heart stopped. He\u2019d never imagined Dan ever saying those words to him. He always thought that he\u2019d been overreacting when things Dan did made his breath hitch, or his stomach come alive with butterflies. He always thought Dan was just super affectionate and would be the same with other friends too. He always liked to think he was special, even if he knew he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>But now that Dan has said it, it confirmed that his gut feelings were right after all. All those times he refused to admit to himself that he may be falling for his roommate suddenly seemed so silly. The pain in Dan\u2019s eyes made it seem like he had been so afraid of admitting this, as if he was expecting Phil to run away in disgust. Phil wanted to fix that immediately.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Dan, I never thought you\u2019d feel the same.\u201d<br></p><p>Dan blinked, not sure if he heard Phil right. There\u2019s no way Phil felt the same for him. The setting sun made the gold-blue of Phil\u2019s eyes glisten beautifully and Dan watched as tears slowly start to fall down Phil\u2019s cheeks, mirroring his.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Dan.\u00a0There\u2019s no one I\u2019ve ever cared for as much as I do for you,\u201d Phil said brokenly, trying to breathe properly through his crying.</p><p>Dan was still in a state of shock. He let himself be wrapped by Phil\u2019s arms as he took in Phil\u2019s words. He was prepared to be left at the beach by a repulsed ex-roommate. But here he was instead, loosely hugging Phil\u2019s waist while being in Phil\u2019s warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026?\u201d was all Dan answered.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, Dan, I wasn\u2019t ever gonna say it because I thought you never felt the same,\u201d Phil said, laughing a little at how silly that sounds now.<br></p><p>Phil couldn\u2019t stop crying from joy, he didn\u2019t even know he could cry from happiness this much. He hugged Dan tighter, never wanting to let go.</p><p>Dan shook his head in disbelief. Slowly, his lips turned up into a smile. And for the first time in a while, he smiled a genuine smile, finally feeling truly happy.</p><p>\u201cThe whole week\u2026 it was because of this?\u201d Phil said, pulling back from the hug but holding onto Dan\u2019s shoulders.<br></p><p>\u201c\u2026yeah, I\u2019m in love with you but I didn\u2019t want to ruin the friendship we already have,\u201d Dan admitted, finding it so easy to say it now that Phil\u2019s said it too. He felt like he didn\u2019t ever want to stop saying it now.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re like this,\u201d Phil laughed.<br></p><p>Dan laughed too. In hindsight, they both know each other so well already, so they should\u2019ve seen this coming. They should\u2019ve known and trusted their instincts, but who would\u2019ve known that they were both too scared to admit the same thoughts all this while.</p><p>They sat there laughing for a while, at how unreal it was that this was how they found out. That this was how they realised they were in love. And in love with each other. Sitting by the beach miles away from where they first met, in front of a beautiful sunset. All because Dan was too numb to feel after feeling too much.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, Dan, I\u2019ll never leave you. Not after graduation, not ever for as long as you want me by your side,\u201d Phil said, cupping Dan\u2019s cheeks and thumbing away the stray tears.<br></p><p>\u201cForever sounds good,\u201d Dan whispered as he smiled up at Phil.<br></p><p>It felt like it happened in slow motion but too fast at the same time, when they both instinctively moved closer. Dan could feel Phil\u2019s breath on his nose but his mind barely had time to register what was happening before he was closing his eyes and feeling Phil\u2019s lips against his.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s waist as they kissed. He felt his heart soar right out of his dark abyss. Phil\u2019s hands never left his cheeks, and his lips felt like home. Dan found comfort in this strange sense of familiarity in the new beginning upon them.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t count the number of times he\u2019d wished he could kiss Dan on his hands. His heart was beating rapidly as he pressed his lips against Dan\u2019s, he can\u2019t believe he was finally getting his wish. It felt right, like they were meant to fit each other. Dan\u2019s lips was soft against his, and he thinks that he could never get enough of it.</p><p>They pulled back when they needed air. Phil could finally see the life in Dan\u2019s eyes again. The sun was almost completely set, but the last few rays it was leaving behind illuminated the hazel in Dan\u2019s eyes. Phil thought that he looked absolutely beautiful, wet cheeks and all.</p><p>Dan\u2019s mind was still running a mile a minute, but with all good thoughts now. He wondered what this now means for them, where they\u2019d be headed from now on. But they would figure things out. He knew they\u2019d be by each other\u2019s side through anything just like they\u2019d always been, and that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>\u201cAre we going back now?\u201d he asked, feeling Phil\u2019s breath against his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only just got here, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d Phil said, unable to contain his smile.</p><hr><p>songs featured from Phil\u2019s road trip playlist:</p><p>Rebellion (Lies) - Arcade Fire</p><p>Propaganda - Muse</p><p>Wetsuit - The Vaccines</p><p>Not In Love - Crystal Castles</p><p> (in order, new song after each line break except Propaganda)<br></p><p>-</p><p>do tell me what you think! :) maybe I could try venturing into more non-smut, or maybe I should stick to smut only lmao</p></p>",

The only thing worse than sinking again is letting Phil see him sink again. He had tried. He&rsquo;d tried to be better, stay better for the sake of Phil. If only so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to see concern and worry and even sadness pool in those bright blue eyes. But sometimes he just couldn&rsquo;t help falling back into the dark abyss of emptiness. What else could he do if everything is pointless anyways.</p><p>Dan felt the edge of his bed dip. He shut his eyes, not wanting to face the world. Not wanting to face his roommate and the fact that he&rsquo;s a disappointment for letting his roommate down again. He knows Phil would never blame him, but deep down he blames himself for causing Phil so much worry.</p><p>Gentle hands pulled the blanket off his face. Dan blinked up, regretting it instantly when he saw Phil&rsquo;s brows crease.</p><p>Phil hated seeing him like this. He knew that behind that lifeless stare was a warm hazel, full of wonder and awe. He loved seeing those eyes look back at him with excitement when they skip lectures for a movie, how they twinkle with hope when Phil assures him that everything will be fine in times when he couldn&rsquo;t see anything positive in his future. Or in times when he couldn&rsquo;t see himself even having a future at all.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Whenever Dan was in this dark part of his mind, he just felt numb and emotionless. But Phil could simply say two words and suddenly his eyes stung with tears, his heart beat with fury and he felt too much all at once.</p><p>He wanted to answer Phil, wanted to yell at him, wanted to disappear. But he didn&rsquo;t have the energy for any of that. All he could do was shrug and shut his eyes again.</p><p>Phil brushed away the curl that was covering Dan&rsquo;s forehead. Dan can&rsquo;t remember the last time he had a haircut, and he was sure that his messy tangled curls were definitely an unruly sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Could you try to get up for me please? I know you haven&rsquo;t eaten since yesterday and we should have lunch now,&rdquo; Phil spoke softly, his words so full of care that Dan can&rsquo;t deny his requests even if he wanted to.<br /></p><p>Dan felt like his whole body was protesting as he tried to sit up. He&rsquo;d been in bed since yesterday afternoon, and judging from Phil returning from school, it was probably past noon now. Still it didn&rsquo;t feel like he&rsquo;d had any rest at all. His mouth felt dry, but he didn&rsquo;t have the appetite to eat or even drink.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;not hungry,&rdquo; was all Dan managed to mumble out.<br /></p><p>Phil bit his lip as he thought of how to coax Dan out of his bed. He knew that Dan always tried his best for him, even if he felt too exhausted to do anything. But he also didn&rsquo;t want to push Dan too hard when he got like this. He took Dan&rsquo;s hand in his.</p><p>Dan stared at his hand being sandwiched between Phil&rsquo;s. Phil felt so warm around his cold hand. He slowly looked up at Phil quizzically.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a drive,&rdquo; Phil suggested softly.<br /></p><p>Phil wasn&rsquo;t a good driver; failed twice before finally getting his license and then never making use of it for a year after getting it despite having a car that was gifted to him by his parents for finally passing. Dan knew this and joked about how he would never risk his life being Phil&rsquo;s passenger. But there was one day when Dan was falling into the darkness again, and he said something that stuck to Phil.</p><p>Dan talked about how he just wanted to feel free. The kind of freedom where he wouldn&rsquo;t have to think about any responsibility he had, any failures or people he&rsquo;d disappointed. The kind of freedom that he knew was temporary, but forgetting about his past and future to live in the moment would help him feel at peace even if just for a while until his mind was clear enough again to face his problems.</p><p>And Dan talked about how he&rsquo;d feel that kind of fleeting freedom when he went on road trips. The vast fields and open skies as far as he could see down the never-ending road ahead gave him a sense of liberty. It shows him how big the world is, and how small his problems are in contrast. That there is so much more to life and what the world has to offer than his own worries and anxiety. And when he sees it that way, he&rsquo;ll get more confident in trying to overcome his problems, instead of letting them eat him up instead.</p><p>Since then, Phil actually started practising his driving more. Dan was skeptical at first, but Phil insisted on driving him to campus one day. Dan thought he&rsquo;d fear for his life, but it ended up being a really pleasant ride and he never made fun of his driving ever again.</p><p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; Dan mumbled, staring at Phil&rsquo;s thumb tracing circles on his hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anywhere. Nowhere, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But let&rsquo;s just get out of here for a while,&rdquo; Phil said, hoping for Dan to agree.<br /></p><p>When Dan looked back up at Phil, all Phil could see was a cold, despondent stare that he was determined to bring warmth back into.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s whole body felt heavy, it was screaming at him to go back under the covers. But he looked at Phil, looked at his hopeful smile and his encouraging eyes. He already felt enough of a disappointment, he just couldn&rsquo;t disappoint his best friend any further.&nbsp;</p><p>So Dan gave a small nod, making Phil&rsquo;s whole face light up.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil quickly got up and grabbed a few pieces of clothing for both of them, shoving them into his backpack. Just in case. He didn&rsquo;t know how long he&rsquo;d need to drive before Dan felt better again.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was done packing, he turned back to Dan whose eyebrows were knitted together as he looked at him. He was probably wondering why Phil needed to pack, but he didn&rsquo;t voice it out.&nbsp;</p><p>Phil came back to Dan&rsquo;s bed and held onto Dan&rsquo;s hands again. He gently pulled Dan up, and Dan pliantly allowed his body to be moved as Phil pleased.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Phil said excitedly, never letting go of Dan&rsquo;s hand as he dragged his friend out of their room.<br /></p><hr /><p>Dan immediately shut his eyes once he got settled in the car. The sun was blinding, and he felt like it was sucking whatever little energy he had left out of him. He just wanted to sleep. He trusted Phil to keep them both safe as he drove to wherever.</p><p>Phil looked over at Dan in dismay. He hoped that his plan would work, he just had to give Dan time. He was feeling hungry, having missed breakfast to attend his morning lecture and missed lunch to get back to Dan as soon as he could. So he decided to get them both food first.</p><p>Phil could tell that Dan wasn&rsquo;t asleep because every now and then he would peek an eye open just to see where they were. So Phil knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t be disturbing Dan if he filled the silence with music.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s brain was demanding him to sleep but shouting at him about all his worries at the same time. But through the loudness of his mind, he could still hear the song Phil started playing.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>Sleeping is giving in<br />No matter what the time is<br />Sleeping is giving in<br />So lift those heavy eyelids</i><br /></p><p>The lyrics hit Dan, and he opened his eyes and looked at Phil. He wondered if Phil chose the song on purpose.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry did you wanna sleep? I can turn it off-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;fine,&rdquo; Dan interrupted,&nbsp;&ldquo;but what are you playing?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil tried to hide his joy. That was the most he&rsquo;d heard his best friend speak at once in the past few days.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my road trip playlist!&rdquo; he responded excitedly.<br /></p><p><i>People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya<br />Come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour</i><br /></p><p>Dan grunted in what he hoped Phil understood as an approval before facing away from him again. He leaned against the window, staring blankly at the cars passing by. He thought about how his dreams could save him, if only they were attainable.</p><p>Dan had zoned out after that, liking the buzz in his head more than the song forcing him to be self-aware. But as Phil slowed into a driveway, he tuned back into the present.</p><p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ya wanna get?&rdquo; Phil asked, stopping behind a queue of cars.<br /></p><p>Dan looked around and realised that Phil had entered a McDonalds drive-thru.</p><p>Dan shrugged,&nbsp;&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan knew that Phil knows Dan&rsquo;s go-to order at McDonalds anyway. And Phil knew that Dan knew that, but he was just trying to get Dan to talk.</p><p>A few minutes later, Phil was shoving a big bag onto Dan&rsquo;s lap. The aroma of the food did stir Dan&rsquo;s stomach up. It growled as Dan salivated. The thing about sinking into the darkness was that even if he was hungry, he&rsquo;d be too preoccupied with fighting against the demons in his head to realise. But with the food now right on his lap, he suddenly couldn&rsquo;t wait to eat. He looked over at Phil.</p><p>Phil smiled at him, it was the first time that day that Dan&rsquo;s gaze was more than just a blank, dead one. Phil thought he looked kinda cute all wide-eyed silently asking if he could eat.</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead! I&rsquo;ll find somewhere to park first,&rdquo; he said as he drove into the carpark.</p><p>Dan looked into the bag. Phil had gotten him a quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. Just as he liked it. He grabbed a couple of fries and started munching on them first.</p><p>When Phil was parked, they took their food out and laid it out as best as they could on the dashboard.</p><p>&ldquo;How come we used the drive thru just to sit at the carpark?&rdquo; Dan mumbled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t want to enter the place with the crowd in there and all&hellip;&rdquo; Phil rationalised.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dan mused,&nbsp;&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have liked that. Thanks.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil smiled, glad he did make the right choice. He started digging into his big mac, but kept a watchful eye on Dan to make sure he ate too.</p><p>Dan was still slowly munching on his fries. When he noticed that Phil was glancing over at him, he wordlessly offered Phil some of his fries.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, I got my own,&rdquo; Phil said with his mouth still full.<br /></p><p>But Dan insisted, bringing the fries in his fingers closer to Phil&rsquo;s face. Phil&rsquo;s giggle was stifled when the fries were pushed into his mouth. Phil smiled as he chewed, happy that his friend was slowly feeling okay enough to show affection again. Dan didn&rsquo;t even seem bothered that his fingertips were caught between Phil&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>Dan quite liked feeding Phil. He wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly why, but he always got a sense of joy whenever he let his friend have a bite of his pizza, or fed him a forkful of pasta, or tilted his drink for Phil to take a sip. And it was nice to feel something other than emptiness as he fed Phil his fries this time.</p><p>Phil was aware how Dan liked to feed him when he was being in a cheeky mood. Dan didn&rsquo;t seem to be doing this to be cheeky this time, but Phil was happy it&rsquo;s happening all the same, and he&rsquo;d accept however much food being fed to him to make his friend happy.</p><p>Dan alternated between eating his fries and giving some to Phil. He liked how Phil didn&rsquo;t question him or make him stop, but just accepted his offer every time. When he eventually ran out of fries, he wiped his hand clean and looked out the window.</p><p>&ldquo;You not gonna eat your burger?&rdquo; Phil asked, wiping his mouth as he finished his own food.<br /></p><p>Dan busied himself looking at a couple of kids laughing and running into the restaurant. Oh what fun it is to be young and free. He shook his head no.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s shoulders drooped a little. He&rsquo;d thought that Dan was starting to feel better.</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m full already,&rdquo; Dan answered,&nbsp;&ldquo;maybe later.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Phil responded softly.<br /></p><p>Phil started the car and slowly went out of the driveway.&nbsp;He drove aimlessly. He didn&rsquo;t have a proper destination in mind, and he didn&rsquo;t really care how long he&rsquo;d have to drive or where they ended up as long as they were together and he&rsquo;d have his Dan by the end of it. He saw the sign saying they were leaving Manchester, and decided to just continue driving south.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s road trip playlist started again, but the songs didn&rsquo;t hit home as much as the first one, so Dan asked him to restart it.</p><p><i>People try and hide the light<br />Underneath the covers</i><br /></p><p>Dan stared out the window most of the ride. The weather was the opposite of his gloomy mood. The late afternoon sun was beaming down on them. He saw cows and sheep grazing lazily on the open fields. The clouds looked beautiful against the blue sky. For a fleeting moment, Dan let himself believe that life <i>can</i> be beautiful. He grabbed his milkshake, overwhelmed by the sudden thought. Perhaps the milkshake can give him a brain freeze that would numb him from overthinking for a while.</p><p><i>Now here&rsquo;s the sun, it&rsquo;s alright<br />Lies, lies</i><br /></p><p>Dan appreciated that Phil didn&rsquo;t try to force a conversation out of him. Phil knew that he needed his space even while he needed someone to be there for him at the same time. He never thought anyone would get that, but Phil does. Phil understands him so well that it scares him as much as it comforts him sometimes. He sipped on his milkshake harder.</p><p>The song ended, Phil&rsquo;s playlist moving on to a more upbeat pop song. Phil tapped along to the song on his steering wheel, humming at the chorus. Dan looked over at his friend. Phil seemed so content to just drive. Drive for no reason other than for Dan to clear his mind. Although it was his petrol and his time of day that Dan was wasting.</p><p>Phil looked back over just then, and smiled at Dan. Dan pursed his lips into a forced smile, even though he meant it in a genuine way. He just couldn&rsquo;t understand why Phil would care for him this much.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you driving?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s brows creased together.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, why are you doing this? Don&rsquo;t you have that assignment due soon? And your petrol-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about any of that Dan, you know I&rsquo;m always here for you. I want to help you feel better, no matter what.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan gulped. The sincerity in Phil&rsquo;s voice scared him. He didn&rsquo;t feel like he deserved such attention and care from anyone. He turned back to facing the road ahead. The unending path taking them to anywhere, nowhere. Taking them to wherever it is that Dan will supposedly feel better, before heading back.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s reaction worried Phil a little. He was afraid that Dan might&rsquo;ve changed his mind about this road trip. Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea all along, and Dan was just following along because he felt like he had to.</p><p>&ldquo;We could always go back if you want?&rdquo; Phil asked tentatively.<br /></p><p>Dan looked surprised for a second, but he shook his head almost immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I like this. Thank you,&rdquo; Dan murmured.<br /></p><p>He wished he could show his gratitude better. Maybe when he felt better he&rsquo;d repay Phil somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;If you wanna go back at any time just tell me, alright?&rdquo; Phil asked, still a little worried.<br /></p><p>Dan nodded, proceeding to sip on his milkshake.</p><p>They fell into comfortable silence again. If only Dan&rsquo;s mind could match the silence between them.</p><p>Dan started thinking about his latest episode and the main thing on his mind. A lot of times, his mood plummeted for almost no reason at all, but sometimes he&rsquo;d have a clearer understanding of why it happened. Especially if his mind won&rsquo;t stop reminding him about his main worry at the moment.</p><p>He stole glances at Phil. Phil, his roommate of 3 years since his first day of university. Phil, who quickly became his best friend. Phil, a year his senior who would be graduating in about a month. Phil, who had been by his side through everything he&rsquo;d been through both good and bad.</p><p>He has no clue how he was going to survive his final year without Phil. Phil had been there for him through every breakdown he had in university. He&rsquo;d quickly learned how to help Dan in such situations, and by now it&rsquo;s like he knew just what Dan needed even if Dan didn&rsquo;t know himself.</p><p><i>Pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-pro-paganda</i><br /></p><p>Dan&rsquo;s inner monologue was momentarily interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;How is this a road trip song?&rdquo; he chuckled a little.<br /></p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t care if it wasn&rsquo;t an appropriate road trip song. If it made Dan laugh, even just a little, then it stays on the playlist.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay I may not be the best at making playlists that follow the theme properly,&rdquo; Phil giggled,&nbsp;&ldquo;but I like this song!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan can&rsquo;t argue with Phil there, not when he looked so damn adorable with his tongue poking out as he giggled. He felt something flutter in his gut. Something he hadn&rsquo;t felt in a while since he sank into his darkness. He can&rsquo;t decide if he liked the feeling or not.</p><p>Dan can remember the times he&rsquo;d felt the flutter in his stomach; there weren&rsquo;t many before he met Phil. But with Phil, it could happen for the most random reasons and catch him off guard. Things that he never thought would affect him in the slightest would send the butterflies in his stomach into a frenzy whenever Phil did it. Like right now. All Phil was doing was laughing. He&rsquo;d miss that laugh very much.</p><hr /><p>Two hours passed, and they reached Birmingham.</p><p>&ldquo;I gotta go pee,&rdquo; Phil said urgently as he exited the highway and drove to the nearest petrol station.<br /></p><p>They both used the restroom and Phil refilled his car&rsquo;s petrol. Phil got some snacks and drinks, and then he was ready to go off again. But before that, he had to check in on Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you feeling better?&rdquo; he asked softly.<br /></p><p>Dan actually was starting to crawl out of his dark hole, but Phil&rsquo;s question made him feel like crying. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was in a good way or not. He just wanted to adjust the stray fringe drooping across Phil&rsquo;s forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; Dan managed to answer.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you wanna go back?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan looked at the time. It was only a quarter past five. They had plenty of time. He had plenty of Phil&rsquo;s time to waste.</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Dan admitted quietly.<br /></p><p>Phil smiled softly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go then. Oh, and please eat your burger Dan, it&rsquo;s probably gone cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan had almost forgotten he still had food left, but he wasn&rsquo;t hungry, so he&rsquo;ll save it for later.</p><p>Dan thought that Phil&rsquo;s playlist was a mess. It had lots of pop songs mixed in with some indie and rock songs, and even an edm song or two thrown in for the hell of it. But it was rather endearing how Phil just put whatever he liked. Dan, on the other hand, would have to analyse every single lyric of every song, would have to feel the correct emotions as the song plays, for it to be put in his themed playlists. He wished he could give less of a shit like Phil for these kind of things that ultimately don&rsquo;t matter as long as you&rsquo;re having fun in the end.</p><p>But a few of the songs in there really made Dan think. And those were the only ones he would actually approve of being in a road trip playlist.</p><p><i>If at some point we all succumb<br />For goodness sake let us be young<br />Because time gets harder to outrun<br />And I&rsquo;m nobody, I&rsquo;m not done</i><br /></p><p>Phil observed how Dan gazed far out into the fields. He thought about how Dan&rsquo;s mind must be running a mile a minute, just like Dan once told him when he got like this. He wished he could hear Dan&rsquo;s thoughts, if only so he could learn what he needs and how to help him better.</p><p>Phil very much preferred the rambly Dan over the silent Dan when he goes through tough times. Even though Dan could ramble on and on endlessly, his monologues were always so profound and Phil was always blown away by his intelligence. He loved having deep conversations with Dan. He always learned something new about Dan, their friendship, or even random facts. And he felt special that Dan was willing to open up to him so much.</p><p>But Dan was in a quiet mood now, and he&rsquo;ll respect that even if it was killing him to know what Dan was thinking.</p><p>He recalled the first time Dan had a breakdown in their room. Frankly, Phil was afraid because he really hadn&rsquo;t known what he could do to help. He&rsquo;d listened to his friend speak out all his worries that he&rsquo;d bottled up, and tried to calm him down, but it took about a week for Dan to feel like himself again.</p><p><i>We all got old at breakneck speed<br />Slow it down, go easy on me<br /></i></p><p>Phil thought about how when he met Dan, the teen was so shy and reserved, but as they grew closer and older together, he got to know just how amazing, kind hearted and intelligent he is.</p><p>He started thinking about all the moments that they&rsquo;ve shared over the years in university. Not just big events, but even little everyday moments. Things that don&rsquo;t seem special when done with other friends were greatly cherished when it was with Dan.</p><p>He remembered how after Dan spent the night crying over his overdue assignment that caused his first breakdown, he&rsquo;d ordered McDonalds for their supper. Dan hadn&rsquo;t eaten the entire day, and still refused to eat. Phil wasn&rsquo;t sure what Dan would like, so he just ordered randomly. A quarter pounder with fries and a milkshake. They&rsquo;d sat on their floor, Dan slowly eating his food while Phil talked animatedly about the squirrels and pigeons he saw on the way to campus. Just going on and on about trivial matters in the hopes of making Dan smile.</p><p>And they&rsquo;ve had plenty of late night suppers over the years. Not all sad of course. Most were actually times they stayed up playing video games. Some nights were spent celebrating little victories like completing essays or passing a quiz. Phil was an introvert himself who didn&rsquo;t really enjoy going out partying all the time, so he was delighted to have gotten a roommate who felt the same and wouldn&rsquo;t judge him for turning down a night out. While their coursemates celebrated the end of exams in clubs, Dan and Phil would just have a quiet night in their room with a bottle of wine shared between them. Phil had quickly realised that he didn&rsquo;t care about making more friends or hanging out with other people, he just wanted to be with Dan.</p><p>Phil thought about how they&rsquo;d skip lectures just to hang out as if they don&rsquo;t already see enough of each other in their room. How they&rsquo;d sleep in after a movie marathon the whole night. How they&rsquo;d mess up the entire pantry every time they tried to cook. How their study sessions in the library almost always ended up in some funny competition to get the other person to make a noise without getting caught. He was going to miss all those little moments, maybe even more so than the big events they went through together.</p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t believe that 3 years with Dan flew by so quickly. He&rsquo;d had some of the best times of his life with him, and they&rsquo;d been through some of their toughest together. He sighed inaudibly when he realised just how much he&rsquo;ll miss Dan when he graduates.</p><hr /><p>They soon drove past Slough. Phil wondered if they should stop by London, but Dan didn&rsquo;t seem interested in stopping at all. Dan had dozed off for about half an hour, and when he got up his mood still didn&rsquo;t seem to improve much. He did, however, start eating his burger.</p><p>Dan was peacefully eating but stopped when he realised they were in Slough.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re driving me home,&rdquo; he pleaded.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No no I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Phil reassured him, trying not to read too much into how betrayed Dan sounded.<br /></p><p><i>Cause it&rsquo;s cold outside, when you coming home<br />Cause it&rsquo;s hot inside, isn&rsquo;t that enough</i><br /></p><p>Phil loved going home. He was always homesick in university, that is until he met Dan. After Dan came into his life he still always wanted to go home of course, but less because he couldn&rsquo;t cope living away from family and more because he was just always so eager to share with his family stories about him and Dan and their little adventures.</p><p>He&rsquo;d even brought Dan home during a holiday once, because Dan didn&rsquo;t want to go back to his own home and Phil couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of leaving Dan to spend his holiday alone in campus. His family had loved Dan, and even though Dan was nervous at first, Phil was happy to see how quickly he warmed up to them. Since then, Dan actually spent more holidays with Phil&rsquo;s family than his own.</p><p>Phil never could quite empathise with Dan not liking going home. He did drive Dan back home for a holiday once, and Dan&rsquo;s family seemed loving and welcoming. Dan had explained to him how his hometown was just filled with bad memories for him. Phil hoped that one day Dan would be able to overcome his past.</p><p>Dan visibly relaxed into his seat after Phil reassured him. He looked warily at the sign and the road exiting the highway and leading into his hometown. Dan recalled the first time he followed Phil home for the holidays, after much persuasion from Phil. His mom had sounded really upset over the phone when he informed her he wasn&rsquo;t going home. But besides the guilt for upsetting his mom, Dan had had the most fun in years. He felt a lump in his throat as he thought about having to spend the holidays alone in campus after Phil graduates. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly invite himself to Phil&rsquo;s anymore, can he.</p><p>The evening sun gave off a beautiful golden gleam on the horizon. Through the side view mirror, Dan could see the golden hour making his skin glow, despite his eyebags and dark eye circles.<br /></p><p><i>Fascination ends<br />Here we go again</i><br /></p><p>He turned to Phil. The sun brought out the colours of his eyes perfectly. Dan thought that Phil&rsquo;s eyes were magical, with the way they seemed to change shades under the light. He even told Phil once just how mesmerising he found his eyes to be.</p><p>Phil would smile at Dan every time Dan turned to him. Dan took the moment to appreciate how the golden hues from the sun blended with the green-blue of Phil&rsquo;s eyes. And then he realised that those eyes were looking back at his own tired, dull ones. Dan never imagined that he&rsquo;d let himself look so disheveled in front of someone so perfect.</p><p>Dan decided to pay attention to Phil&rsquo;s playlist instead of letting his mind fixate again. The beat of the music was throbbing.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m not in love<br />I&rsquo;m not in love<br />I&rsquo;m not in love</i></p><p>The already propulsive synths become unavoidably sweeping as the singer&rsquo;s declaration sounds shakier each time he repeats it, as if it was getting harder and harder to convince himself the truth of the words he sang. Dan felt the singer&rsquo;s emotional vulnerability in his bones, and it wasn&rsquo;t helping him to stop fixating at all. In fact it did the complete opposite.</p><p>He&rsquo;d never been in a relationship. Neither had Phil. It was a common topic between them - quiet conversations about how they both hope to find love one day. The kind of love that is unconditional, that won&rsquo;t fade out but grow stronger as time goes on and they understand their partners better. But Dan wasn&rsquo;t so sure that life could be such a fairytale. Who could love him unconditionally when he was so broken?</p><p>He recalled one conversation they had about what they looked for in a partner, and both of them listed characteristics that actually matched each other. Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was him overthinking that or if it was a coincidence, but Phil didn&rsquo;t seem to connect the dots, so Dan had concluded that it was just him and repressed it.</p><p>And how was he meant to know what love felt like anyway? Were the butterflies in his stomach a sign or are those just short-lived feelings? Where&rsquo;s the line that crosses between merely caring for someone and actually being in love with them and when do you know that you&rsquo;ve crossed it?</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and wondered if being in love was meant to hurt.</p><p>Phil was alarmed when he turned to Dan and noticed that Dan was tearing up. One moment Dan was just gazing at him passively and the next it seemed that he was trembling slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;You alright, Dan?&rdquo; he voiced his concern.<br /></p><p>Dan wanted to respond, but he knew that if he allowed himself so much as to say one word, he&rsquo;d start bawling, or throwing up his burger. He swallowed thickly, forcing himself to nod his head.</p><p>Phil knew by now that Dan was lying, but he also knew not to push Dan too hard if he didn&rsquo;t want to speak. He knew that Dan would tell him in time. So he just reassured Dan that he&rsquo;ll be there to listen if Dan decides to talk.</p><p>Dan nodded again, turning to look out the window instead. He blinked furiously, not letting his tears fall. He watched the horses running along the fields to calm himself down.</p><p>Realisation is always the easy part. It&rsquo;s the acceptance after that that is harder to conquer. Denial would be more tempting, but Dan knows that won&rsquo;t be good for him in the long run. He&rsquo;d burst eventually; all his bottled up emotions will overflow as regret takes over and he could no longer deny his feelings.</p><p>But how was he to accept? Deep down, he knew that he&rsquo;d realised long ago, and that he was quietly in denial all along. Because what other option does he have?</p><p>Phil only had a month left before graduating. Before packing up all his stuff in their room and moving out to start the new chapter in his life. And leave this chapter behind, with Dan in it.</p><p>Dan had trouble enough accepting that his best friend was leaving soon, how was he supposed to accept the fact that he had feelings for him? And how was he supposed to admit it if the feelings weren&rsquo;t mutual?</p><p><i>We are not in love<br />We are not in love<br />We are not in love<br />We are not in love</i><br /></p><p>Actually Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was mutual or not. Sometimes he would catch Phil looking at him in a way that Dan can&rsquo;t find the words to describe, but it would make his heart skip a beat. Their friends always turned heads whenever Phil invited Dan to his home for the holidays. Phil would almost always rather be with Dan than anyone else, even if he&rsquo;d already spent the entire week alone with him, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s just being nice to him or if he&rsquo;s that introverted. Dan wasn&rsquo;t able to discern if Phil was just a super caring friend or if he went out of his way for Dan all the time because he actually loved him back. Where is that line?</p><p>But the nasty thought at the back of his mind told him that he&rsquo;s overthinking all those little moments. There&rsquo;s no way Phil could love him back, especially when he&rsquo;s more often a burden than a friend. Like right now, when Phil could be resting or completing his assignment, but he&rsquo;s out here doing the best he can to help Dan feel better instead.</p><p>Dan looked at the road signs. They were only less than an hour away from Brighton. He wondered what Phil would do next to help him once the road ends. He needed to start feeling better, for Phil&rsquo;s sake.</p><hr /><p>When they reached Brighton, Phil drove to a less touristy part of the beach and parked.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get ice cream,&rdquo; he said, his smile reaching his eyes.<br /></p><p>When Dan didn&rsquo;t answer immediately, Phil tried again.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, we gotta at least get out and stretch!! We&rsquo;ve been cooped up in here too long.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>So Dan agreed, and his knees cracked as he stood up outside the car. Phil stretched his arms and sides, sighing in contentment.</p><p>They could hear the waves and smell the salty waters of the English Channel. The sun was going lower on the horizon, the golden hour making the seaside even more beautiful than the plains.</p><p>Dan quietly followed Phil to the nearest ice cream shop. Phil walked so close that their hands brushed, and even as Dan blushed, he could tell that Phil didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp;</p><p>The look on Phil&rsquo;s face when he got his ice cream was almost enough to make Dan forget his plight. Phil&rsquo;s smile was contagious, and Dan found himself smiling a little as well while they walked to a quieter part of the beach to enjoy their ice cream.</p><p>Phil plopped himself down on the pebbles, and Dan sat a little more gracefully. Phil sighed happily. It took him little to be happy. All he needed was his best friend by his side, a good ice cream and the beautiful sunset as the waves crashed in front of them. He licked his salted caramel ice cream.</p><p>When he turned to Dan, to no surprise, Dan was offering him his ice cream. Phil smiled and tasted his friend&rsquo;s strawberry ice cream before letting him taste his too. Phil&rsquo;s smile faltered a bit when he realised just how much he&rsquo;s going to miss peaceful moments like this with Dan. He had to cherish them while they last.</p><p>&ldquo;Feeling better?&rdquo; Phil checked in again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Dan said honestly.&nbsp;Now that his mind was clearer on what&rsquo;s been bugging him recently and now that he&rsquo;d accepted his feelings, he did feel better. He felt like he didn&rsquo;t need to numb his emotions anymore. He was free from his dark hole, if just for this moment.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;m glad the road trip worked,&rdquo; Phil said cheerfully.<br /></p><p>Dan felt a somewhat bittersweet feeling. The crashing of the waves and the seagulls above them were the only sounds breaking their peaceful silence. A couple of people strolled by occasionally, and there were some kids running along the coast with their dogs. Dan thought about how fortunate he was, that he could be anywhere in the world with anyone, but fate placed him with Phil watching the sunset by the beach. He did not want to think about how different his life and his university experience would&rsquo;ve been if Phil didn&rsquo;t end up as his roommate.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Dan said in a small voice.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Phil smiled as he ate the last bit of his ice cream cone. He scooted closer to his friend.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just talking about the road trip, or the ice cream,&rdquo; Dan explained, sensing that Phil didn&rsquo;t quite understand.<br /></p><p>Phil tilted his head a little, indicating that he&rsquo;s listening for Dan to continue.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, for driving all the way here. For always being so patient and understanding with me, and dealing with my shit. Even if you don&rsquo;t get why I think certain things the way I do, like how a drive could help me, you still do them anyway for me. You didn&rsquo;t have to waste your money or time but you&rsquo;re so selfless like that and just. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil was caught off-guard. Dan did show him appreciation whenever he helped him out of his episodes, but he never really said it with such raw emotion before. Dan&rsquo;s voice cracked, wavered as he spoke. Phil wanted to say that it&rsquo;s fine, he was always more than happy to help, but Dan wasn&rsquo;t done.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for. For knowing what I need when even <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know what I need. I don&rsquo;t know how you do that. And thank you for all the times you stood by me when you could&rsquo;ve gone to your other friends, and for never leaving me alone. For-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, your ice cream,&rdquo; Phil interrupted.<br /></p><p>Dan&rsquo;s ice cream was melting down his fingers, but he didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for making me <i>feel</i>. When I feel nothing at all, when I&rsquo;m too numb, you just show up and be <i>you</i> and I feel alive again?&rdquo; Dan wasn&rsquo;t even sure if he&rsquo;s making sense now.</p><p>His vision was blurring. He&rsquo;d spent countless nights with Phil just talking about how he felt all the time, but he&rsquo;d never really spoken at length about just how much he appreciated Phil. Phil deserved to know what an amazing friend he is, and Dan was now frustrated for not letting Phil know it enough.&nbsp;But he felt vulnerable as he continued speaking, like he&rsquo;s finally opening all of himself up for Phil to see.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna do without you, Phil,&rdquo; Dan whispered into his melted ice cream, trembling as he finally let his tears flow free.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Dan&hellip;&rdquo; Phil whispered, quickly wiping the ice cream off Dan&rsquo;s messy hand with a napkin.</p><p>He then pulled his shaking friend into a tight hug, bracketing his legs around Dan&rsquo;s thighs and effectively removing any space between them.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grown so much in the years I&rsquo;ve known you, and I know that you&rsquo;re gonna do just fine,&rdquo; Phil rubbed his hand on Dan&rsquo;s back as he spoke into Dan&rsquo;s ear.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss you so much,&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice cracked again.</p><p>Phil tucked Dan&rsquo;s head under his chin. Dan fisted at Phil&rsquo;s shirt as he let his tears fall onto Phil&rsquo;s chest.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss you too, more than you imagine,&rdquo; Phil started tearing up too.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s alright, Dan, because we still have a month before I graduate,&rdquo; Phil said as he pulled away from Dan and lifted his chin so he could look him in the eyes,&nbsp;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll never forget you or leave you behind after uni.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan looked up and saw nothing but sincerity and certainty in Phil&rsquo;s eyes. He almost dared himself to believe that nothing would change after Phil was done with uni. But he knows that that&rsquo;s impossible. Especially if he tells Phil his true feelings.</p><p>He was still afraid of how Phil would react. This could ruin everything they had, but Dan was willing to take the risk. He&rsquo;d gone too many sleepless nights just thinking and denying and bottling up everything about how he felt for Phil. He reckoned that now more than ever was a good time to admit it and then seek closure no matter the outcome.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Dan whispered almost bitterly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Phil knitted his brows.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Phil patiently waited. Gave Dan time to voice out what he had in mind. He gently carded his hand through Dan&rsquo;s matted curls.</p><p>Dan breathed in deep. Phil running his hand on his scalp helped him calm down but also made him more afraid to continue speaking. It could possibly be the final touch of affection he&rsquo;d ever get from Phil, and he wanted it to last.</p><p>When he couldn&rsquo;t drag it out any longer, he dared himself to look Phil in the eyes as he said his next few words.</p><p>&ldquo;Because I love you, Phil.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan felt like a huge weight lifted off his shoulders, but felt his throat and chest tighten up at the same time. He felt free of the secret that&rsquo;s been eating him up, but the seconds that passed waiting for Phil to respond were filled with dread. He wanted to look away, too ashamed of possibly ruining their friendship, but he couldn&rsquo;t because Phil&rsquo;s intense gaze was locked on to his.</p><p>As Dan spoke those words with such a painful honesty in his voice, Phil felt as if his heart stopped. He&rsquo;d never imagined Dan ever saying those words to him. He always thought that he&rsquo;d been overreacting when things Dan did made his breath hitch, or his stomach come alive with butterflies. He always thought Dan was just super affectionate and would be the same with other friends too. He always liked to think he was special, even if he knew he wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>But now that Dan has said it, it confirmed that his gut feelings were right after all. All those times he refused to admit to himself that he may be falling for his roommate suddenly seemed so silly. The pain in Dan&rsquo;s eyes made it seem like he had been so afraid of admitting this, as if he was expecting Phil to run away in disgust. Phil wanted to fix that immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, Dan, I never thought you&rsquo;d feel the same.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Dan blinked, not sure if he heard Phil right. There&rsquo;s no way Phil felt the same for him. The setting sun made the gold-blue of Phil&rsquo;s eyes glisten beautifully and Dan watched as tears slowly start to fall down Phil&rsquo;s cheeks, mirroring his.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Dan.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no one I&rsquo;ve ever cared for as much as I do for you,&rdquo; Phil said brokenly, trying to breathe properly through his crying.</p><p>Dan was still in a state of shock. He let himself be wrapped by Phil&rsquo;s arms as he took in Phil&rsquo;s words. He was prepared to be left at the beach by a repulsed ex-roommate. But here he was instead, loosely hugging Phil&rsquo;s waist while being in Phil&rsquo;s warm embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;?&rdquo; was all Dan answered.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Dan, I wasn&rsquo;t ever gonna say it because I thought you never felt the same,&rdquo; Phil said, laughing a little at how silly that sounds now.<br /></p><p>Phil couldn&rsquo;t stop crying from joy, he didn&rsquo;t even know he could cry from happiness this much. He hugged Dan tighter, never wanting to let go.</p><p>Dan shook his head in disbelief. Slowly, his lips turned up into a smile. And for the first time in a while, he smiled a genuine smile, finally feeling truly happy.</p><p>&ldquo;The whole week&hellip; it was because of this?&rdquo; Phil said, pulling back from the hug but holding onto Dan&rsquo;s shoulders.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;yeah, I&rsquo;m in love with you but I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin the friendship we already have,&rdquo; Dan admitted, finding it so easy to say it now that Phil&rsquo;s said it too. He felt like he didn&rsquo;t ever want to stop saying it now.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re like this,&rdquo; Phil laughed.<br /></p><p>Dan laughed too. In hindsight, they both know each other so well already, so they should&rsquo;ve seen this coming. They should&rsquo;ve known and trusted their instincts, but who would&rsquo;ve known that they were both too scared to admit the same thoughts all this while.</p><p>They sat there laughing for a while, at how unreal it was that this was how they found out. That this was how they realised they were in love. And in love with each other. Sitting by the beach miles away from where they first met, in front of a beautiful sunset. All because Dan was too numb to feel after feeling too much.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise you, Dan, I&rsquo;ll never leave you. Not after graduation, not ever for as long as you want me by your side,&rdquo; Phil said, cupping Dan&rsquo;s cheeks and thumbing away the stray tears.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Forever sounds good,&rdquo; Dan whispered as he smiled up at Phil.<br /></p><p>It felt like it happened in slow motion but too fast at the same time, when they both instinctively moved closer. Dan could feel Phil&rsquo;s breath on his nose but his mind barely had time to register what was happening before he was closing his eyes and feeling Phil&rsquo;s lips against his.</p><p>Dan squeezed Phil&rsquo;s waist as they kissed. He felt his heart soar right out of his dark abyss. Phil&rsquo;s hands never left his cheeks, and his lips felt like home. Dan found comfort in this strange sense of familiarity in the new beginning upon them.</p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t count the number of times he&rsquo;d wished he could kiss Dan on his hands. His heart was beating rapidly as he pressed his lips against Dan&rsquo;s, he can&rsquo;t believe he was finally getting his wish. It felt right, like they were meant to fit each other. Dan&rsquo;s lips was soft against his, and he thinks that he could never get enough of it.</p><p>They pulled back when they needed air. Phil could finally see the life in Dan&rsquo;s eyes again. The sun was almost completely set, but the last few rays it was leaving behind illuminated the hazel in Dan&rsquo;s eyes. Phil thought that he looked absolutely beautiful, wet cheeks and all.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s mind was still running a mile a minute, but with all good thoughts now. He wondered what this now means for them, where they&rsquo;d be headed from now on. But they would figure things out. He knew they&rsquo;d be by each other&rsquo;s side through anything just like they&rsquo;d always been, and that&rsquo;s all that matters.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we going back now?&rdquo; he asked, feeling Phil&rsquo;s breath against his lips.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only just got here, we&rsquo;ve got time,&rdquo; Phil said, unable to contain his smile.</p><hr /><p>songs featured from Phil&rsquo;s road trip playlist:</p><p>Rebellion (Lies) - Arcade Fire</p><p>Propaganda - Muse</p><p>Wetsuit - The Vaccines</p><p>Not In Love - Crystal Castles</p><p> (in order, new song after each line break except Propaganda)<br /></p><p>-</p><p>do tell me what you think! :) maybe I could try venturing into more non-smut, or maybe I should stick to smut only lmao</p></p>",
