Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be? What could he possibly be missing? He had everything he wanted, right? An amazing career, a beautiful and not really dysfunctional family, a large circle of friends (famous and non famous) and more money than he could need for 3 or 4 lifetimes. And Harry was happy. He loved his life and even if he could, he wouldn&rsquo;t change anything about it.</p><p>Sometimes though, after a concert, after hearing the screams of his fans, after filling his heart with all the love they were sending him, after the boost of adrenaline he had every single time he was performing&hellip; sometimes, after all this was gone and he ended up alone in a hotel room&hellip; <i>sometimes</i>, he felt lonely. Sometimes, some things from his past rushed through his mind. The mistakes he made, the words he said but didn&rsquo;t mean, the paths he choose impulsively.. all this invaded his thoughts, no matter what he was trying to do.</p><p>He would never admit it, but sometimes, he even found himself crying in bed late at night, unable to fall asleep, as if something was forcing him to go through those memories again and again.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Are you ready to get back on stage?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked up at his new best friend and guitarist, diving his gaze into Mitch&rsquo;s eyes before quickly nodding.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, only a few shows left.&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t even sure what he wanted, anymore. He loved being on stage, it gives him a sensation he wasn&rsquo;t able to get anywhere else. It brought inside him a feeling intense that couldn&rsquo;t be compared to anything&hellip; or almost. He pushed the thought away and just shrugged. Harry also liked relaxing, and he knew he needed it, but where was he supposed to relax when this tour will be over? Home? Where was even home? He didn&rsquo;t know anymore. The only real home he could remember was when he lived with his sister and his mom. That was home. Since then, nothing had really felt like home.</p><p>He grabbed his notebook and scribbled the word &ldquo;HOME&rdquo; in caps, followed with a bunch of question marks. He would laugh at himself if he didn&rsquo;t feel so pathetic.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we stop at a book store?&rdquo; Mitch asked, looking at the road ahead of him.</p><p>Harry was not the type to let himself get driven. He liked to take the wheel, he liked to be in control. In every single part of his life. There was no exception and there probably would never be. But today, he was tired, and he didn&rsquo;t want to argue. Perhaps, he felt a bit nostalgic that his tour was almost over.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, sure, why not.&rdquo; he just said, shrugging. &ldquo;I need something new to read anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>The book store was small and normally, the cute bell that rang when Harry pushed the front door would have made him smile but he just couldn&rsquo;t. What was right in front of him was not something he expected to see.</p><p>There was a big photo in the middle of a table, surrounded by a ton of copies of the same book. He stared at the girl on the picture and held his breath until Mitch passed by him, hitting his shoulder lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Mate, you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Swallowing hard, Harry just nodded but couldn&rsquo;t take his eyes off of her. She smiled exactly the way he remembered and somehow, it made his heart skip a beat. How many months passed since he had seen her? 20? 22? Almost two years.</p><p>He took a step closer and held his breath as he grabbed the book in his hand, turning it around swiftly only to meet her smiling face again. She had always wanted to be an author, and she had talent. No matter how many times she would doubt herself, no matter how many times she would groan as she sat in front of her computer, no matter how many times she&rsquo;d delete everything to start again&hellip; He knew she had talent. He was her first reader, and he hoped that somehow, it changed something.</p><p>Slowly and very carefully, he opened the book, moving the pages gently until the very first. There was a few words written as a dedication and reading them made him swallow again.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;To you. You know who you are.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t want to sound vain, but he knew it was for him. He knew this book was written for him and even if he was scared of what was inside, he was also touched and slightly excited. He turned the book again, his eyes stopping a few seconds again on her picture, before to read the short synopsis.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;When Amelia Carter met Henry Miles, her whole life changed. He was handsome, rich, and famous, but it was not what dragged her to him-&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>With a frown, Harry looked up and sighed. <i>Henry Miles</i>? Was she serious? Quickly and without thinking, he walked to the front desk to pay, putting the book on the counter a bit roughly and searching for his wallet in his back pocket.</p><p>When he was not on stage, he liked to wear comfortable and totally non-glamorous clothes and today was no exception. Simple black shorts and the first t-shirt his hand had reached was the outfit he had picked this morning and he couldn&rsquo;t really careless.</p><p>The girl he handed his card to was looking at him like she knew who he was and he didn&rsquo;t feel at ease, suddenly. Perhaps it was because he was buying this book or maybe just because he was not in the mood to talk to fans on that day. Either way, all he could think about was walk out of this place and leave. With his purchase, of course.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like a bag?&rdquo;</p><p>He avoided the girl&rsquo;s eyes and simply nodded, tapping his fingers on the counter, his black painted nails making an annoying noise as he did.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for shopping here!&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled and grabbed his bag, still not looking at the girl in the eyes, which was not something usual for him. He&rsquo;s always been polite and well-mannered but at this exact moment, a bunch of shit was invading his mind and the thoughts that crept in his head on some alone nights in hotel rooms were now bothering him during day time.</p><p>Where was she? What happened to her? Did she think about him sometimes? Did she hate him now? After all the pain he made her endure, he wouldn&rsquo;t blame her if she did. Then why did he hope that she didn&rsquo;t hate him? Why did he desperately want to see her again?</p><blockquote><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p></blockquote><p>The ride to the airport was boring and long. Every other second, Harry would glance at the book in his hands. Why he didn&rsquo;t have the guts to open it already was obvious and every time he&rsquo;d flip the first pages, something would stir in his stomach. He wanted it. He wanted to know how she felt about him, he wanted to know what she actually thought of him. Of course, it was a work of fiction, but he knew when she wrote, she put her whole heart into it. Did he enjoy thinking he was still in her heart? Perhaps a bit more than he should, yes.</p><p>For some odd reason, he was so lost in his thought that he forgot he was not alone. He forgot he was in public. He forgot there would be paparazzis waiting to snap a picture of him in his old sweatpants and holed shirt. He forgot his face would be all over the internet in less than an hour. </p><p>He grabbed his bag and got out of the car, holding the book in one of his hands. The cover seemed to burn his palm but he walked naturally, sending small smiles to the fans screaming his name and waving gently at them until they were out of sight.</p><p>How he managed to sit in the plane with the same damn book laying on his lap was a mystery but he stared at it and it seemed to stare right back, teasing him or smirking at him just to piss him off.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you buy it if it was not to read it?&rdquo; he breathed to himself in an annoyed tone before grabbing it roughly and skipping the few empty pages at the start.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;She fell in love the first time she saw him. He was tall, dark, handsome, and totally inaccessible.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p> Was he really inaccessible? He didn&rsquo;t feel like he was, but perhaps, from the outside, he could seem like it. Wait, did she write she fell in love the first time their eyes met?</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;He made her lose control, a control she was attached to, a control she liked having. Falling in love with Henry Miles was like throwing herself off a cliff without anything to absorb the shock, without anyone to catch her at the bottom. \u00a0Falling in love with him was the most daring thing she had ever done, and letting him get in her life, the most dangerous.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Harry re-read the paragraph four times, maybe five, without really knowing how to feel. He never knew her feelings were so strong, he never knew she gave him a chance to break her. And that&rsquo;s what he did. He broke her.</p><p>Slowly, he closed the book, letting the words he read sink in. It took him a few seconds before grabbing his phone and turning it on. Not his official phone, of course. Not the phone he texted his friends, family and management with. Not the phone he needed for work. No, he grabbed the other phone, with the dark pink phonecase.</p><p>He moved his fingers on the screen until he got in a specific folder. <i>Her</i> folder. He couldn&rsquo;t help his lips to curl sadly at the sight of them together. She would always insist on taking selfies of them both. <i>&ldquo;For the memories&rdquo;</i> she always said. <i>&ldquo;When we&rsquo;ll be old and senile, we&rsquo;ll need those pictures to remember.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He only laughed at her words but deep down, he always thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t need the pictures because he&rsquo;d always have her. But now&hellip; Now he didn&rsquo;t have her anymore, and he was glad those pictures existed.</p><p>She looked so young, maybe even younger than him, even if she was almost 8 years older. It didn&rsquo;t matter. For some reason he didn&rsquo;t understand, she enjoyed when people would mistaken her for younger.</p><p>His heart twisted in his chest as he flipped the pictures quickly and he swallowed the pain that was slowly spreading inside him. With a sigh, he closed his eyes and turned the phone off again. He desperately wanted to text her. He wanted to ask her so many questions, tell her how sorry he was, and maybe even more, but he didn&rsquo;t. Instead, he threw his phone back in his bag, along with the book.</p><p>He needed time to think. He needed time to put all the pieces back together. He just didn&rsquo;t want to admit to himself that he needed <i>her</i>.<br/></p>",

He loved being on stage, it gives him a sensation he wasn\u2019t able to get anywhere else. It brought inside him a feeling intense that couldn\u2019t be compared to anything\u2026 or almost. He pushed the thought away and just shrugged. Harry also liked relaxing, and he knew he needed it, but where was he supposed to relax when this tour will be over? Home? Where was even home? He didn\u2019t know anymore. The only real home he could remember was when he lived with his sister and his mom. That was home. Since then, nothing had really felt like home.</p><p>He grabbed his notebook and scribbled the word \u201cHOME\u201d in caps, followed with a bunch of question marks. He would laugh at himself if he didn\u2019t feel so pathetic.</p><p>\u201cCan we stop at a book store?\u201d Mitch asked, looking at the road ahead of him.</p><p>Harry was not the type to let himself get driven. He liked to take the wheel, he liked to be in control. In every single part of his life. There was no exception and there probably would never be. But today, he was tired, and he didn\u2019t want to argue. Perhaps, he felt a bit nostalgic that his tour was almost over.</p><p>\u201cYea, sure, why not.\u201d he just said, shrugging. \u201cI need something new to read anyway.\u201d</p><p>The book store was small and normally, the cute bell that rang when Harry pushed the front door would have made him smile but he just couldn\u2019t. What was right in front of him was not something he expected to see.</p><p>There was a big photo in the middle of a table, surrounded by a ton of copies of the same book. He stared at the girl on the picture and held his breath until Mitch passed by him, hitting his shoulder lightly.</p><p>\u201cMate, you okay?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, Harry just nodded but couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her. She smiled exactly the way he remembered and somehow, it made his heart skip a beat. How many months passed since he had seen her? 20? 22? Almost two years.</p><p>He took a step closer and held his breath as he grabbed the book in his hand, turning it around swiftly only to meet her smiling face again. She had always wanted to be an author, and she had talent. No matter how many times she would doubt herself, no matter how many times she would groan as she sat in front of her computer, no matter how many times she\u2019d delete everything to start again\u2026 He knew she had talent. He was her first reader, and he hoped that somehow, it changed something.</p><p>Slowly and very carefully, he opened the book, moving the pages gently until the very first. There was a few words written as a dedication and reading them made him swallow again.</p><p><i><b>\u201cTo you. You know who you are.\u201d</b></i></p><p>He didn\u2019t want to sound vain, but he knew it was for him. He knew this book was written for him and even if he was scared of what was inside, he was also touched and slightly excited. He turned the book again, his eyes stopping a few seconds again on her picture, before to read the short synopsis.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhen Amelia Carter met Henry Miles, her whole life changed. He was handsome, rich, and famous, but it was not what dragged her to him-\u201d</b></i></p><p>With a frown, Harry looked up and sighed. <i>Henry Miles</i>? Was she serious? Quickly and without thinking, he walked to the front desk to pay, putting the book on the counter a bit roughly and searching for his wallet in his back pocket.</p><p>When he was not on stage, he liked to wear comfortable and totally non-glamorous clothes and today was no exception. Simple black shorts and the first t-shirt his hand had reached was the outfit he had picked this morning and he couldn\u2019t really careless.</p><p>The girl he handed his card to was looking at him like she knew who he was and he didn\u2019t feel at ease, suddenly. Perhaps it was because he was buying this book or maybe just because he was not in the mood to talk to fans on that day. Either way, all he could think about was walk out of this place and leave. With his purchase, of course.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a bag?\u201d</p><p>He avoided the girl\u2019s eyes and simply nodded, tapping his fingers on the counter, his black painted nails making an annoying noise as he did.</p><p>\u201cThank you for shopping here!\u201d</p><p>He smiled and grabbed his bag, still not looking at the girl in the eyes, which was not something usual for him. He\u2019s always been polite and well-mannered but at this exact moment, a bunch of shit was invading his mind and the thoughts that crept in his head on some alone nights in hotel rooms were now bothering him during day time.</p><p>Where was she? What happened to her? Did she think about him sometimes? Did she hate him now? After all the pain he made her endure, he wouldn\u2019t blame her if she did. Then why did he hope that she didn\u2019t hate him? Why did he desperately want to see her again?</p><blockquote><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p></blockquote><p>The ride to the airport was boring and long. Every other second, Harry would glance at the book in his hands. Why he didn\u2019t have the guts to open it already was obvious and every time he\u2019d flip the first pages, something would stir in his stomach. He wanted it. He wanted to know how she felt about him, he wanted to know what she actually thought of him. Of course, it was a work of fiction, but he knew when she wrote, she put her whole heart into it. Did he enjoy thinking he was still in her heart? Perhaps a bit more than he should, yes.</p><p>For some odd reason, he was so lost in his thought that he forgot he was not alone. He forgot he was in public. He forgot there would be paparazzis waiting to snap a picture of him in his old sweatpants and holed shirt. He forgot his face would be all over the internet in less than an hour. </p><p>He grabbed his bag and got out of the car, holding the book in one of his hands. The cover seemed to burn his palm but he walked naturally, sending small smiles to the fans screaming his name and waving gently at them until they were out of sight.</p><p>How he managed to sit in the plane with the same damn book laying on his lap was a mystery but he stared at it and it seemed to stare right back, teasing him or smirking at him just to piss him off.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you buy it if it was not to read it?\u201d he breathed to himself in an annoyed tone before grabbing it roughly and skipping the few empty pages at the start.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShe fell in love the first time she saw him. He was tall, dark, handsome, and totally inaccessible.\u201d</b></i></p><p> Was he really inaccessible? He didn\u2019t feel like he was, but perhaps, from the outside, he could seem like it. Wait, did she write she fell in love the first time their eyes met?</p><p><b><i>\u201cHe made her lose control, a control she was attached to, a control she liked having. Falling in love with Henry Miles was like throwing herself off a cliff without anything to absorb the shock, without anyone to catch her at the bottom. \u00a0Falling in love with him was the most daring thing she had ever done, and letting him get in her life, the most dangerous.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry re-read the paragraph four times, maybe five, without really knowing how to feel. He never knew her feelings were so strong, he never knew she gave him a chance to break her. And that\u2019s what he did. He broke her.</p><p>Slowly, he closed the book, letting the words he read sink in. It took him a few seconds before grabbing his phone and turning it on. Not his official phone, of course. Not the phone he texted his friends, family and management with. Not the phone he needed for work. No, he grabbed the other phone, with the dark pink phonecase.</p><p>He moved his fingers on the screen until he got in a specific folder. <i>Her</i> folder. He couldn\u2019t help his lips to curl sadly at the sight of them together. She would always insist on taking selfies of them both. <i>\u201cFor the memories\u201d</i> she always said. <i>\u201cWhen we\u2019ll be old and senile, we\u2019ll need those pictures to remember.\u201d</i></p><p>He only laughed at her words but deep down, he always thought that he wouldn\u2019t need the pictures because he\u2019d always have her. But now\u2026 Now he didn\u2019t have her anymore, and he was glad those pictures existed.</p><p>She looked so young, maybe even younger than him, even if she was almost 8 years older. It didn\u2019t matter. For some reason he didn\u2019t understand, she enjoyed when people would mistaken her for younger.</p><p>His heart twisted in his chest as he flipped the pictures quickly and he swallowed the pain that was slowly spreading inside him. With a sigh, he closed his eyes and turned the phone off again. He desperately wanted to text her. He wanted to ask her so many questions, tell her how sorry he was, and maybe even more, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he threw his phone back in his bag, along with the book.</p><p>He needed time to think. He needed time to put all the pieces back together. He just didn\u2019t want to admit to himself that he needed <i>her</i>.<br></p></p>",
