Luckily, Jin always knows what you\u2019re thinking. </i></p><p>You walk into Jin\u2019s apartment for what seems like the hundredth time this week. Of course you loved going to Jin\u2019s and didn\u2019t mind bringing a bag of clothes and make up so that you could stay there for a few days but you wished you never had to leave his apartment and go back to yours. The worst part of your week was when you had to leave Jin for even a day just to stay at yours for a bit. You wished you could live with him and stay in his apartment with him.\u00a0</p><p>As you closed the door behind you, you were instantly hit with delicious smells coming from the kitchen as your boyfriend was cooking away his amazing food. This is just one of the many things you loved about being in Jin\u2019s apartment, smelling Jin\u2019s amazing food and just coming home to Jin. That was your favourite part of the day.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cJagiya! you\u2019re back how was your day?\u201d,</i> your amazing boyfriend asked as he gave you a quick kiss before continuing to cook the food.\u00a0<i>\u201cIt was okay but my landlord called and said he wanted to raise the rent so I have to pay more now which sucks\u201d, </i>you said as you stared at your boyfriend, waiting for him to suggest that you move in with him, hoping that he\u2019d catch on to the fact you don\u2019t want to have your apartment anymore. But to your surprise he didn\u2019t say anything along those lines, instead he just answered with\u00a0<i>\u201cyeah, that does suck\u201d</i>which made you a little upset.\u00a0</p><p>Silence began to fill the room as you just watched Jin cook the food, wanting him to say something more. You didn\u2019t want to be the one who quickly suggested you two move in together, the thought filled you with anxiety as you didn\u2019t want Jin to think you were desperate and needy, you didn\u2019t know how to tell him so you wanted him to ask you. After a while the silence became unbearable, usually you and Jin would have moments when neither one of you would talk because sometimes you would just sit on the counter and watch Jin cook, not needing to talk to him because you just loved watching him, you loved being there with him. This time was different though Jin hadn\u2019t caught on to the fact you wanted to move in with him, so he continued cooking thinking you were just watching him like you usually do.However, you couldn\u2019t help but think that maybe you were jumping ahead of things, after all you and Jin had only been dating 8 months but it felt like now was the right time to take the next step. You couldn\u2019t help but have all these thoughts rush through your head so you decided to take a shower before dinner.\u00a0</p><p>After taking your shower, your thoughts were still flooding your brain since you didn\u2019t want to lose Jin but you also wanted to take your relationship further. You put on one of Jin\u2019s t shirts that was basically a dress on you and put on a pair of shorts then went downstairs to eat the amazing food Jin had prepared. As you walked towards the table, Jin had light candles and dimmed the lights, making it a romantic atmosphere with his chilled music playing in the background. Jin slowly walked up to you, wrapping his arms around your waist as he lay a soft kiss on your lips. Once your lips had parted, Jin told you how beautiful you looked, he loved it when you wore his t shirts, it showed him that you were his. Jin then pulled out a chair for you and after you sat down, he took his seat and you both had dinner together, talking about your days and loving each others company. After you and Jin had cleared the stuff off the table, Jin sat you on the sofa and said\u00a0<i>\u201cClose you eyes, I have a surprise for you\u201d.</i></p><p>Curiosity began to fill your brain as you wondered what it could be, nothing expected you for what Jin had for you.\u00a0<i>\u201cOkay y/n, open your eyes\u201d, </i>as you took your hands away from your eyes, you slowly opened them and your jaw instantly dropped. In front of you, in Jin\u2019s hand, was a silver, heart-shaped keychain, engraved on it the exact date you and Jin had met. Tears began to form in your eyes as you looked back at Jin who had a smile across his face as he asked\u00a0<i>\u201cy/n? Will you please move in with me? I know you might think it\u2019s a bit soon but I just love you so much and just want you to come home here everyday because I want this to be your home. Our home\u201d,</i> Jin said as he stared into your eyes, waiting for a response.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of answering him straight away, you just attacked Jin\u2019s lips, needing to show him how much he means to you. In-between you attacking Jin with kisses all over his face, you kept saying yes in between each kiss you placed on him which then caused Jin to let out little giggles since he couldn\u2019t help how cute you were. Jin then grabbed your face and kissed you sweetly telling you how much he loved you which you obviously responded to, telling him you loved him too.\u00a0<i>\u201cSo, when can you move in?\u201d, </i>Jin asked with a smirk on his face. \u00a0As he laid you down on sofa, you immediately sat up and dragged him down on top of you as you attached his lips onto yours, switching sides as you straddled him and began to remove your clothes, another thing Jin loved you wearing, nothing.\u00a0<i>\u201cYou\u2019re my favourite meal y/n\u201d,</i> Jin growled in your ear as he flipped you both over so that he was on top of you and worked his way down to where you needed him most, as he intended to show you how much you meant to him, in every way, over and over again.\u00a0</p><p>Anon Kookie xoxo </p><p><a href=\"https://anonkookie.tumblr.com/post/175638165663/masterlist-bts-drabbles-date-night-taehyung-date\">MASTERLIST</a></p>",

Luckily, Jin always knows what you\u2019re thinking. </i></p><p>You walk into Jin\u2019s apartment for what seems like the hundredth time this week. Of course you loved going to Jin\u2019s and didn\u2019t mind bringing a bag of clothes and make up so that you could stay there for a few days but you wished you never had to leave his apartment and go back to yours. The worst part of your week was when you had to leave Jin for even a day just to stay at yours for a bit. You wished you could live with him and stay in his apartment with him.\u00a0</p><p>As you closed the door behind you, you were instantly hit with delicious smells coming from the kitchen as your boyfriend was cooking away his amazing food. This is just one of the many things you loved about being in Jin\u2019s apartment, smelling Jin\u2019s amazing food and just coming home to Jin. That was your favourite part of the day.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cJagiya! you\u2019re back how was your day?\u201d,</i> your amazing boyfriend asked as he gave you a quick kiss before continuing to cook the food.\u00a0<i>\u201cIt was okay but my landlord called and said he wanted to raise the rent so I have to pay more now which sucks\u201d, </i>you said as you stared at your boyfriend, waiting for him to suggest that you move in with him, hoping that he\u2019d catch on to the fact you don\u2019t want to have your apartment anymore. But to your surprise he didn\u2019t say anything along those lines, instead he just answered with\u00a0<i>\u201cyeah, that does suck\u201d</i>which made you a little upset.\u00a0</p><p>Silence began to fill the room as you just watched Jin cook the food, wanting him to say something more. You didn\u2019t want to be the one who quickly suggested you two move in together, the thought filled you with anxiety as you didn\u2019t want Jin to think you were desperate and needy, you didn\u2019t know how to tell him so you wanted him to ask you. After a while the silence became unbearable, usually you and Jin would have moments when neither one of you would talk because sometimes you would just sit on the counter and watch Jin cook, not needing to talk to him because you just loved watching him, you loved being there with him. This time was different though Jin hadn\u2019t caught on to the fact you wanted to move in with him, so he continued cooking thinking you were just watching him like you usually do.However, you couldn\u2019t help but think that maybe you were jumping ahead of things, after all you and Jin had only been dating 8 months but it felt like now was the right time to take the next step. You couldn\u2019t help but have all these thoughts rush through your head so you decided to take a shower before dinner.\u00a0</p><p>After taking your shower, your thoughts were still flooding your brain since you didn\u2019t want to lose Jin but you also wanted to take your relationship further. You put on one of Jin\u2019s t shirts that was basically a dress on you and put on a pair of shorts then went downstairs to eat the amazing food Jin had prepared. As you walked towards the table, Jin had light candles and dimmed the lights, making it a romantic atmosphere with his chilled music playing in the background. Jin slowly walked up to you, wrapping his arms around your waist as he lay a soft kiss on your lips. Once your lips had parted, Jin told you how beautiful you looked, he loved it when you wore his t shirts, it showed him that you were his. Jin then pulled out a chair for you and after you sat down, he took his seat and you both had dinner together, talking about your days and loving each others company. After you and Jin had cleared the stuff off the table, Jin sat you on the sofa and said\u00a0<i>\u201cClose you eyes, I have a surprise for you\u201d.</i></p><p>Curiosity began to fill your brain as you wondered what it could be, nothing expected you for what Jin had for you.\u00a0<i>\u201cOkay y/n, open your eyes\u201d, </i>as you took your hands away from your eyes, you slowly opened them and your jaw instantly dropped. In front of you, in Jin\u2019s hand, was a silver, heart-shaped keychain, engraved on it the exact date you and Jin had met. Tears began to form in your eyes as you looked back at Jin who had a smile across his face as he asked\u00a0<i>\u201cy/n? Will you please move in with me? I know you might think it\u2019s a bit soon but I just love you so much and just want you to come home here everyday because I want this to be your home.

Unfortunately, this only proves that love and support are\nabsent in the relationship.</p><p><b>Page of Swords:</b> So this card says that this\nrelationship will be based on intellectual strengths. I think someone in the\nrelationship has this energy it describes this person being likely to be\nattracted to a person&rsquo;s mind rather than looks. Jimin will be very social,\nwitty and chatty, but not terribly romantic. On the not terribly romantic part\nmeans one partner might be doing more romantic things then the other. There may\nbe some worry about it or a feeling that you cannot fully trust your partner.</p><p>So I pulled\nanother card to see how this will end</p><p><b>Three of Wands:</b> This card can mean moving on or away\nfrom a relationship. Resolving all old and hurtful issues in the past with each\nother. Putting the hard times in the past and moving forward maybe into a new\nrelationship or just getting on with life again. This card talks about positive\nprogress.</p><p>So sorry this\nis not a good relationship for you maybe your bias wrecker might treat you\nbetter.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"http://paypal.me/bangtanallday\">Tip Jar</a><br /></p>",

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn? </small></p><p><small>\n\n\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>\u00a0<br/></small></p><p><small>\n\n\u203b <b>Next Time:</b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small><br/></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 2: Time is of the Essence </i></h2><!-- more --><p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin mocked her\ntone, \u201cFine, if you marry one of them, then I will marry one of your mother\u2019s\nladies in waiting.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Sumin gasped and\nglared coldly at him, \u201cWhich one and I will see to it that she is fired.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Seokjin chuckled\ndeeply, still finding it fun to push her buttons. The playful knight and the\nteasing princess continued to tease one another, both not showing signs of\nceasing. </i></p><p><i>While the playful\ncouple was enjoying their own little world, the king and queen eyed them with\ncuriosity in their gaze. They were too absorbed with watching their daughter\nand her knight joke around with each other that they failed to realize that\nthere was a royal presence lingering in the air. </i></p><p><i>Soon, the\nmysterious person cleared his throat, gaining the attention of the king and\nqueen. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAh, King Ji Yong, to what do the\nqueen and I owe the pleasure of your presence on the eve of my daughter\u2019s\nbirthday celebration?\u201d The king spoke in a diplomatic voice.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have come to ask for your\ndaughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d </i></p><p>A blanket of confusion fell upon the royal parents.\nBlank expressions and a few eye blinks. The king and queen\u2019s gazes fell onto\neach other as they grew unsure what to do or even want to say. They were\ncertainly speechless. </p><p>King Kwon Ji Yong, on the other hand, was awaiting\ntheir responses. The moment he sat foot in the castle, he felt a surge of\nwarmth flow through his veins. His heart felt light. His cold, emotionless face\nfinally achieved something that he, himself, thought he would not have the\nability to do. He smiled\u2014 and it was all thanks to Princess Sumin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\ndo I have permission to court your daughter and perhaps propose marriage?\u201d Ji\nYong asked; his patience running a bit thin. </p><p>The king stared seriously at the fellow ruler. He\nhas heard rumors of Ji Yong\u2019s harsh tactics, and his borderline dictatorship\nover his kingdom. Did he honestly want his daughter marrying such a tyrant? Oh,\nhe could not forget King Ji Yong\u2019s wandering hand. Ji Yong was notorious for having\na new mistress every week and being not able to commit to a relationship. Even\nwhile his parents were alive and well, Ji Yong would dismiss his arranged\nmarriages and simply bed a chamber maid like it was nothing. </p><p>The more he thought about, the more Sumin\u2019s father\ngrew against the idea of Ji Yong marrying his precious jewel. Yeah. Ji Yong was\nnot allowed to marry Sumin nor will he <i>ever</i>\nhave his permission. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwill talk it over with my wife and seriously think about it. Since it is my\ndaughter\u2019s eighteenth birthday celebration, I would rather not discuss\nimportant diplomatic decisions on this joyous occasion.\u201d Sumin\u2019s father paused,\nholding out his right hand for his wife to take. \u201cNow, if you excuse me, the\nwife and I have to make an appearance on the ballroom floor.\u201d He bowed politely\nbefore standing up with his wife by his side. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s parents smiled politely before brushing\npast him and making their way through the sea of partygoers. </p><p>Ji Yong watched them disappear into the crowds of\npeople. A light humming emitted from his lips as a devious thought appeared to\nin his mind. He rubbed his chin as the plan developed more and more. His mind\nhad been made up already. He was going to take the Princess Sumin as his wife\nand no one was going to stop him. </p><p>Completely in the center of the grand ballroom, the\nking and queen signaled the orchestra to change the lively tune into the song\nthat was used for the traditional coming of age dance. That specific dance was\npassed down from generation to generation in Sumin\u2019s family and tonight was no\nexception. </p><p>With a single wave, the violinists and cello player\npicked up their bow and began to the play. The somber notes echoed throughout\nthe luxurious room. The mixture of high notes and low notes caused a weird sense\nof relaxation amongst the people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\nis time for the ceremonial dance. Princess Sumin, come hither please. Oh! Bring\nyour suitor of choice as your partner.\u201d The king announced; his line of sight\naligning up with his daughter, who was busy burying her face in the cold metal\nof Seokjin\u2019s armor. </p><p>Princess Sumin groaned as she knew that it was time\nto dance with some arrogant prince who can\u2019t keep his hands to himself. Then,\nby the blessings of the Gods, an idea popped into her pretty little mind. She\nslowly lifted her burning cheek away from the icy cold armor and gazed upon\nSeokjin. Seokjin furrowed his brows, wondering what his princess wanted. Then,\nit hit him. He was about to dance the famous dance in front of millions of\nroyal people.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour\nfather is not going to wait any longer, my lovely daughter.\u201d The two of them\nheard the king say jokingly, earning himself a few polite chuckles. </p><p>Sumin exhaled deeply and then held out her left\nhand, smiling sweetly at her knight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShall\nwe?\u201d She asked; her eyes never once leaving his. </p><p>Seokjin gently grabbed her hand and politely kissed\nit, \u201cWe shall.\u201d </p><p>A roar of applause sounded throughout the large\nroom as Sumin and Seokjin left the comfortable confinements that was their\nlittle corner wall. Seokjin felt the envious gazes hitting his entire body; he\ncouldn\u2019t help but smirk proudly as he did. It was not every day where a lowly\nknight got to share the special dance with a princess. </p><p>After what it seemed like forever, walking through\nmany groups of people, Sumin and Seokjin took their position, right in the\ncenter of the dance floor. With their hands interlocked with one another, their\nbreathing grew heavy as the nerves slowly swallowed them whole. They would be\nthe second couple ever to execute such a special dance. Sumin\u2019s parents were\nthe first. </p><p>With patient hearts and jagged breathing, the\nanxious pair mentally counted down the beats before taking the first step.\nTheir eyes remained locked onto each other, neither one of them wavering their\nestablished contact. Their bodies moved as one as they danced inside the wall\nof people that surrounded them. A light gush of wind gently fanned their faces\nas Sumin and Seokjin continued to simply smile at each other, not saying a\nword. Their stares did all the talking for them. </p><p>They continued to dance as they became oblivious to\ntheir surroundings. The distinguishable faces became blurred as the bodies\ndisappeared one by one. Soon, it was just the two of them. The lavish golds and\nsilvers were the only guests in that ballroom now. One must not forget the tints\nof rose in the walls either. </p><p>Seokjin twirled Sumin, smiling warmly as his brown\neyes bored into hers. His hand never one unlocking with hers as he pulled her\nback. Her skirt raising slightly as Sumin\u2019s entire body spun around, creating a\nlight breeze. </p><p>A soft giggle left Sumin\u2019s innocent lips as she\nreturned to her rightful place\u2014 against Seokjin\u2019s body. Her right fingers\ninterlaced with his left as her left hand was placed firmly on his shoulder\nwhile his right hand was anchored on her waist. </p><p>Nothing but the look of complete adoration was\npresent in the two eyes as the song neared the end. As the final note\nproceeded, Seokjin dipped low as he mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d, to her before\nlifting her up. </p><p>The sound of applause and cheers echoed throughout\nthe castle as Seokjin and Sumin bowed and curtsied to their audience. After\nacknowledging the last section of the crowd, Seokjin leaned down and whispered\nsomething enticing in Sumin\u2019s ear. She quickly masked her pleasing smile with\none of total professionalism. She then turned to Seokjin and slowly licked her\nlips before nodded eagerly yet subtly. She tightened her hold on his hand\nbefore politely excusing herself to her parents. Her parents saw a <i>certain </i>gleam in her eye and chuckled.\nThey knew that look in Seokjin and Sumin\u2019s eyes as they walked quickly out of\nthe ballroom. They were young once and boy did they rush off to their secret\nhiding places to\u2014 have a little bit of fun. </p><p>Not wanting to raise suspicions or a sense of\nworry, the king clapped his hands and demanded that the party continue. The\nquiet room was soon filled with lively music as the once frozen people finally\nleft their spots and filled the dance floor. Soon, happy chatter and polite\nchuckles floated into the air and mixed with the sounds of the orchestra. </p><p>On the other hand, in a different part of the\ncastle, a dimly lit room was filled with the sound of messy kisses and articles\nof clothing dropping to the floor. The skin-on-skin contact ignited a flame of\narousal within Sumin and Seokjin. The sense of urgency caused the two lovers to\nnot care about their outfits when they were practically ripping them off one\nanother. A tattered corset laid on the floor as Sumin\u2019s bare back was firmly pressed\nagainst the cold stone wall. Her hands were raised above her head as Seokjin\u2019s\nmouth was latched onto her beautiful breasts. </p><p>With one nipple in his mouth and the other being\nmassaged by his free hand, Seokjin twirled and pulled the nub in between his\nteeth. Hearing Sumin\u2019s precious moans only fueled his hormones and increased\nhis need to take her virginity. His need to possess Sumin in ways that only a\nlover could do. His need to remind her that she was his. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d\nSumin moaned as her eyes rolled to the back of her head, taking in the pleasure\nthat she was receiving. She felt her core become soaked as she craved <i>something</i> to be inside of her. </p><p>Seokjin continued to assault her breasts as his\nfree hand soon left her chest and slowly trailed down her torso. His fingers\nlightly tickling down her naval before reaching the waist of her skirt. He then\ndecided to tease his princess just a bit, playing with the material as if he\nwas going to undo the ties and let it drop it down.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir\nknight\u2026 please do not tease me\u2026\u201d Sumin whined; her bundle of nerves throbbing\ndesperately. </p><p>Seokjin smirked against her stomach, having left\nher breasts minutes ago, \u201cOh? Is the princess sounding needy? Maybe she needs\nto actually beg if she wants to be touched down there\u2026\u201d </p><p>Sumin\u2019s eyes shot open as she lifted her head away\nfrom the wall. Her gaze locked onto Seokjin as she unknowingly constricted her\nwalls; the desire for something or <i>someone</i>\nto be inside of her grew stronger. Was she seriously thinking about giving up\nher pride as a princess and beg to be touched? Maybe just this once.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease\nSeokjin. Please touch me\u2026\u201d She paused as an airy moan flew out her lips. \u201cMake\nme feel something indescribable that has me a moaning mess.\u201d Sumin begged\nbefore licking her precious lips slowly, enticing him to take what he so\ndesperately craved. </p><p>Seokjin cocked up his brow, lips slightly ajar as\nhis breathing grew heavy. Hearing her begging, pleading for him to touch her\nturned on something in his handsome mind. Was this how a pair of intimate\nlovers behaved? Was this how they displayed true feelings of love with one\nanother? Whatever was bound to happen, he was happy that he was sharing this\nmoment with his precious Sumin. His everything. </p><p>With the sound of light pants and tiny whimpers,\nSumin mentally prepared herself what was about to happen. It was no secret that\nshe eavesdropped on the saucy gossip from her chamber maids and other castle\nworkers. She specially paid attention to the erotic tales that they happily\ngiggled over. Now, it was her moment to shine. It was time for to experience\nthe unspeakable flash of white that the maids spoke of numerous of times. It\nwas time for her feel this sudden wave of euphoria. It was time to become a\nwoman. </p><p>Steadying her racing her heart, Sumin bit her\nbottom lip as she felt his hands slowly trail up her bare thigh. The roughness\nfrom his fingers sent goosebumps on her arms as his fingers lightly danced on\nher skin. </p><p>A small whimper managed to escape her lips as Sumin\nfelt his fingers gradually close the gap. Before she knew it, Seokjin was\ntouching her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ngod\u2026\u201d Seokjin cursed as his fingers were quickly coated with her juices. That\nwas how aroused she was. </p><p>His fingers continued to trace her folds, wanting\nto memorize every detail of her womanhood. He too started to bite his bottom\nlip as he tried to contain his raging hormones. He wanted to wait for their\nwedding night to take her virginity, however, that idea left his mind the\nmoment he encountered her soaking wet core. His index and middle fingers\naccidentally grazed her entrance as they were softly rubbing her pussy. Feeling\nher soaking wet entrance was enough reason for Seokjin to at least give her a\ntiny taste of what it was like to have something inside. He caressed her\nentrance once more before slowly inserting his index finger, careful to take\nnote of her discomfort. His pace started off slow, giving her some time to get\nused to his finger. As soon as her face contorted to a look of pleasure, he\ninserted his middle finger, stretching her virgin walls out. </p><p>Sumin rested her head back on the wall as her hand\nmagically found its way in his hear. She began to tug against the roots as he\npumped his index finger in and out. His thumb rubbed her bundle of nerves,\nsending jolt after jolt of pleasure throughout his princess.</p><p>Her lips were agape as the soft pants mixed with\nmoans fueled her desire to touch him. It was not fair that she was receiving\nthis insane amount of pleasure, and he wasn\u2019t getting anything in return. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nl-love\u2026\u201d She whispered, though, it was difficult since he was still fingering\nher. </p><p>Seokjin continued to thrust his fingers, \u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>A tiny whine left her lips. \u201cIt is not fair that I\nam on the receiving end of our first intimate moment.\u201d Sumin placed her index\nfinger underneath his chin and gently tilted it up. \u201cPermit me to pleasure\nyou.\u201d She smiled alluring. </p><p>Seokjin felt his member twitch in excitement. Holy\nshit. That smile and the fact that she wanted to touch him was making it much\nharder on him to not throw her on the bed and take her now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\ndo not have to, Sumin. It is my duty to make sure that the princess is well\ntaken care.\u201d He teased; his fingers picking up the pace, earning himself a\ncouple of loud moans from her. </p><p>In that split second, hearing that deep tone in his\nvoice, sent an unspeakable chill down her spine. Sumin knew that she was\nvulnerable. She was a prey. She was simply putty in his fingers. </p><p>Back in the ballroom, Sumin\u2019s parents were in a\nheated discussion with King Ji Yong. They tried every excuse in the book to try\nand sway his mind, however, Ji Yong wasn\u2019t going to give up on <i>his</i> princess. Ji Yong was no fool. He\nknew of Sumin\u2019s kingdom\u2019s customs. He knew that that he had to prove himself\nworthy of her in order to be granted permission to wed her by her parents. The\nfun question was, how? How was he going to earn Sumin\u2019s favor when he knows\nsomething was going between her and her personal knight? Ji Yong especially\nobserved the knight\u2019s lip movement while they were dancing sweetly. He saw the\nlowly knight mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d, to Sumin. Something about that irked him,\nbut he couldn\u2019t understand. At least not yet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nhave made up my mind. I would like to stay in the castle and take the time to\nprove myself to the Princess Sumin.\u201d Ji Yong said, looking a tad disinterested.\n</p><p>The king and queen looked to one another, hoping\nthat either one of them would have another excuse on why that would be horrible.\nUnfortunately, they could not think of an excuse. That was one of the loopholes\nthat previous generations have yet to find a solution for. While the prince or\nprincess may have made up his or her mind on who he or she is marrying, another\nsuitor was free to still try and win over the affections of the prince or\nprincess. </p><p>With a heavy sigh, the king met the Ji Yong\u2019s gaze\nand courageously stared him down. No matter what, the happiness of his daughter\nis his top priority. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe\nqueen and I grant you permission to stay in one of our many guest suites during\nyour stay here. I do have to warn you though, that it might be quite difficult\nto win our daughter\u2019s affections as she is not like any other princesses\nthroughout the nation. She is headstrong, intelligent, and charismatic.\u201d The\nking said, trying one last time to turn Ji Yong off from Sumin. </p><p>A sly smile graced his handsome face as Ji Yong\u2019s\neyes sparked with someone unreadable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPerfect.\u201d\n</p><p>Amidst the hard attempts of Sumin\u2019s parents trying\nto convince King Ji Yong to reconsider his marriage proposal, the young lovers\nwere busy filling the room with the sounds of heavy breathing, moaning, and\nloving whispers. </p><p>Seokjin upgraded from simply using his hands to\nusing his hands and his mouth. His tongue flicked and twirled around her\nsensitive nub while his fingers continued to thrust into her. Her sweet smell\nclouded his mind as his throbbing member ached to be in his fingers\u2019 position.\nHis hardened length desperately wanting to be the one feeling her walls clench\naround it; her juices coating him continuously. </p><p>Whimper after whimper. Moan after moan. Pant after\npant. Those were the only sounds happening during their passionate rendezvous.<b></b></p><p>Sumin\u2019s breathing grew rapid as the pleasure built\nup in the pit of her stomach. Her walls began to constrict around his fingers\nas the desire for some form of a release drew closer and closer. This was not\nfair. She wanted to touch him and please him. However, before her mind could\nfocus more on that thought, a sudden sense of happiness rushed throughout her\nbody. Did she experience what the female castle workers called an \u201corgasm\u201d?\nWell, whatever it was, she loved the feeling it gave her. She loved it even\nmore since it was Seokjin who gave her that high. </p><p>Now, with his fingers dripping from her precious\njuices, he decided to give himself a little bit of attention. Seeing her come\nundone like that caused his member to harden even more. It was practically\npressing against the fabric of his trousers. That was how aroused he was. Plus,\nit didn\u2019t help that her <i>smell</i> was\nstill flooding his senses. Every time he took a breath, her sweet aroma came\ncrashing in, sending his hormones into a crazed frenzy. </p><p>His hand quickly undid the belt and then reached\ninside. His aching member twitched even more at the sudden warm contact. With\nher juices coating his fingers, he slowly rubbed his shaft, mixing his pre-cum\nwith her cum. </p><p>Before he could speed up his pace, he felt a\nfamiliar hand on top of his. His lips were captured as well. </p><p>Once she came down her high and regained her\nsenses, her vision locked onto Seokjin. Her eyes trailed down as she noticed\nhis hand moving up and down at a rapid pace.</p><p>Wanting to return the favor, Sumin crawled up to\nhim and placed her dainty hand on top of his. She then captured his beautiful\nlips before he could protest. </p><p>Swallowing his moans, Sumin focused on pleasuring\nthe man in front of him. She wanted him to feel the same high as she felt. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh\nmy\u2026 at this rate, you are going to make me release\u2026\u201d Seokjin moaned as his head\nflew back. His eyes rolled to the back of his head as well. </p><p>Sumin smirked as she hovered her lips over his ear,\n\u201cGood. I want you to feel good my lord.\u201d </p><p>With one simple phrase, Seokjin released. Tiny\nstrips of white shot out, painting Sumin\u2019s hand as she her rubbing slowed down.\n</p><p>A goofy grin graced Seokjin\u2019s handsome face as he\ncame down his euphoric high. He tucked his soft member back inside his trousers\nbefore standing up and finding a cloth to clean up Sumin. </p><p>After searching for a good couple of minutes,\nSeokjin managed to find a white handkerchief and walked back to his princess.\nHe handed the cloth to her as he pressed his lips sweetly against her temple. </p><p>Sumin muttered a quick thank you before wiping off\nany traces of intimacy from her hand. Once her hands were clean, Sumin stared\nat her tattered corset as she wondered how on Earth was she going to explain to\nher mother and father that her undergarment was no longer presence. </p><p>Seokjin noticed Sumin\u2019s brow furrow; a habit she\ndid whenever she thought long and hard about something, \u201cWhat is the matter, my\nlove?\u201d </p><p>Sumin gestured to her corset, \u201cHow am I going to\nexplain to my parents that my corset is destroyed?\u201d</p><p>Seokjin chuckled, \u201cWell, would it ease your mind\nthat I asked your nurse to prepare a second dress for you?\u201d </p><p>Sumin raised her brow, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d</p><p>The joyous celebration continued into the early\nhours into next day. No one showed signs of wanting to leave the birthday\nparty. After all, it is not every day one gets to witness a princess become a\nwoman. </p><p>A mixture of loud instruments filled the ballroom\nas the princess finished her rounds of dancing with every eligible suitor that\nattended her party. Unfortunately, her mind was still preoccupied on the events\nthat took place before she walked back into the ballroom\u2014 wearing an entirely\ndifferent dress. </p><p>Lucky for her, no one seemed to mind or cared\nenough to say something to her. However, would anyone want to accuse the\nprincess of something while he or she was in <i>her</i> kingdom? Probably not. </p><p>Graciously moving across the dancefloor, Sumin\nsmiled politely and maintained eye contact with the princes she was currently\ndancing with. With dark raven colored locks, and his dark brown eyes piercing\ninto hers, she continued to make tiny conversations with the annoying prince.\nJungkook, she believed to be his name. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAm\nI boring you princess? You do not seem too keen on my talk of my many\nachievements.\u201d Sumin heard the arrogant prince say. </p><p>She quickly mustered a sincere smile, \u201cOh, forgive\nmy lord, I was just getting hypnotized by your smile.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her compliment boosted his pride. Maybe he\nwas going to have the honor of marrying the princess. Unlike his fellow\nprinces, who were currently eyeing him with pure envy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\nHas the princess fallen for my charms?\u201d Jungkook inquired, displaying a smile\nthat would make any other princess swoon. </p><p>Sumin fought the urge to gag, \u201cOf course. What kind\nof princess do you take me for?\u201d </p><p>Jungkook cocked up his brow, thinking, \u201cA strong\nmind\u2026 I like it.\u201d</p><p>The two of them continued to dance all across the\nballroom, earning themselves a wave of compliments. The many onlookers smiled\nand admired how Sumin and Jungkook looked together. Something in their combined\naura that made the idea of a union between them favorable, especially with\nJungkook\u2019s parents. </p><p>As the song played the last notes, Sumin politely\ncurtsied to Jungkook while Jungkook returned the favor by bowing to her. Before\nparting ways, Jungkook gently took her hand and placed a chaste kiss on her\nknuckles. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGoodnight,\nprincess.\u201d He winked at her before walking over to his parents.</p><p>Sumin maintained her diplomatic smile until he was\nfar enough away for her to drop it. She let out a small groan before graciously\nwalking over to Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin smirked and looked down on his princess,\nstill having their little steamy meeting embedded in his mind. He secretly\nkissed her soft cheek as he asked her how her little love dance with Prince\nJungkook went. </p><p>Sumin rolled her eyes, \u201cOh, it was magical. Now, I\nam going to my mother and father that it is Prince Jungkook I want to marry and\nhave many children with.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin chuckled deeply, \u201cDo not be like, my\nprincess. I was simply teasing.\u201d</p><p>Just as Sumin was about to retaliate, she heard her\nfather give the announcement that the party celebration was officially over.\nShe then, out of the corner of her eye, noticed him gesturing to her and\nSeokjin. </p><p>The two lovers looked to one another; their brows\nknitted together. Her father\u2019s current expression was unsettling. Something\nhorrific was about to happen, but what. </p><p>Now settled in her father\u2019s office chambers, Sumin,\nwho was resting her head against Seokjin\u2019s shoulder, eyed her parents with pure\nconcern. Her heart raced as her stomach did somersaults while patiently\nawaiting the news from her father. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nlovely daughter\u2026 you know that your mother and I want nothing but the best for\nyou, especially when it comes to choosing your future husband.\u201d Her father\nbegan, trying to find the right words to say next. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\nis happening, papa?\u201d Sumin interrupted as she gripped her hold on Seokjin\u2019s\nhand, feeling afraid that something or <i>someone</i>\nwas going to tear them apart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo\nyou remember meeting King Kwon Ji Yong at the party tonight?\u201d Her father asked.\n</p><p>Both Seokjin and Sumin nodded.</p><p>The king exhaled deeply before baring the terrible\nnews.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\nhas taken it upon himself to invite himself to stay in the castle as our guest\nas he has expressed deep desire to make you his wife.\u201d </p><p>Sumin gasped, suddenly losing all oxygen in her\nlungs. She quickly latched onto the pendant that Seokjin gifted her on her\nfifteenth birthday with a look of complete dread etched on her face.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow\nlong does King Ji Yong plan to stay with us?\u201d Sumin asked softly as Seokjin\nuttered nothing but loving words in her ear, hoping to ease her worries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHowever\nlong it will take for you to agree to be his wife.\u201d Her other responded,\nfeeling her own break for her daughter. </p><p>Sumin frowned as she buried her face in Seokjin\u2019s\nchest, hating the idea of marrying someone else that was not her knight.</p><p>Seokjin, on the other hand, was fuming on the\ninside. He was not happy whatsoever with some random king marrying his\nprincess. They were childhood friends. They were blooming lovers. They had <i>history</i>. No one could ever come close to\nSumin for him. She was it. Now? He knew that he must do something and quick. He\nand Sumin had talked about waiting a few more years and was only granted that\nrequest earlier in the day. This was all wrong. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nmajesties, may I request that the princess and I relinquish our wish to wed in\na few years\u2019 time?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMay\nI ask why?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwant to marry the princess Sumin as soon as possible.\u201d </p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Well how do you like this chapter now?

Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn? </small></p><p><small>\n\n\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>\u00a0<br></small></p><p><small>\n\n\u203b <b>Next Time:</b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small><br></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 2: Time is of the Essence </i></h2>[[MORE]]<p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin mocked her\ntone, \u201cFine, if you marry one of them, then I will marry one of your mother\u2019s\nladies in waiting.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Sumin gasped and\nglared coldly at him, \u201cWhich one and I will see to it that she is fired.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Seokjin chuckled\ndeeply, still finding it fun to push her buttons. The playful knight and the\nteasing princess continued to tease one another, both not showing signs of\nceasing. </i></p><p><i>While the playful\ncouple was enjoying their own little world, the king and queen eyed them with\ncuriosity in their gaze. They were too absorbed with watching their daughter\nand her knight joke around with each other that they failed to realize that\nthere was a royal presence lingering in the air. </i></p><p><i>Soon, the\nmysterious person cleared his throat, gaining the attention of the king and\nqueen. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAh, King Ji Yong, to what do the\nqueen and I owe the pleasure of your presence on the eve of my daughter\u2019s\nbirthday celebration?\u201d The king spoke in a diplomatic voice.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have come to ask for your\ndaughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d </i></p><p>A blanket of confusion fell upon the royal parents.\nBlank expressions and a few eye blinks. The king and queen\u2019s gazes fell onto\neach other as they grew unsure what to do or even want to say. They were\ncertainly speechless. </p><p>King Kwon Ji Yong, on the other hand, was awaiting\ntheir responses. The moment he sat foot in the castle, he felt a surge of\nwarmth flow through his veins. His heart felt light. His cold, emotionless face\nfinally achieved something that he, himself, thought he would not have the\nability to do. He smiled\u2014 and it was all thanks to Princess Sumin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\ndo I have permission to court your daughter and perhaps propose marriage?\u201d Ji\nYong asked; his patience running a bit thin. </p><p>The king stared seriously at the fellow ruler. He\nhas heard rumors of Ji Yong\u2019s harsh tactics, and his borderline dictatorship\nover his kingdom. Did he honestly want his daughter marrying such a tyrant? Oh,\nhe could not forget King Ji Yong\u2019s wandering hand. Ji Yong was notorious for having\na new mistress every week and being not able to commit to a relationship. Even\nwhile his parents were alive and well, Ji Yong would dismiss his arranged\nmarriages and simply bed a chamber maid like it was nothing. </p><p>The more he thought about, the more Sumin\u2019s father\ngrew against the idea of Ji Yong marrying his precious jewel. Yeah. Ji Yong was\nnot allowed to marry Sumin nor will he <i>ever</i>\nhave his permission. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwill talk it over with my wife and seriously think about it. Since it is my\ndaughter\u2019s eighteenth birthday celebration, I would rather not discuss\nimportant diplomatic decisions on this joyous occasion.\u201d Sumin\u2019s father paused,\nholding out his right hand for his wife to take. \u201cNow, if you excuse me, the\nwife and I have to make an appearance on the ballroom floor.\u201d He bowed politely\nbefore standing up with his wife by his side. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s parents smiled politely before brushing\npast him and making their way through the sea of partygoers. </p><p>Ji Yong watched them disappear into the crowds of\npeople. A light humming emitted from his lips as a devious thought appeared to\nin his mind. He rubbed his chin as the plan developed more and more. His mind\nhad been made up already. He was going to take the Princess Sumin as his wife\nand no one was going to stop him. </p><p>Completely in the center of the grand ballroom, the\nking and queen signaled the orchestra to change the lively tune into the song\nthat was used for the traditional coming of age dance. That specific dance was\npassed down from generation to generation in Sumin\u2019s family and tonight was no\nexception. </p><p>With a single wave, the violinists and cello player\npicked up their bow and began to the play. The somber notes echoed throughout\nthe luxurious room. The mixture of high notes and low notes caused a weird sense\nof relaxation amongst the people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\nis time for the ceremonial dance. Princess Sumin, come hither please. Oh! Bring\nyour suitor of choice as your partner.\u201d The king announced; his line of sight\naligning up with his daughter, who was busy burying her face in the cold metal\nof Seokjin\u2019s armor. </p><p>Princess Sumin groaned as she knew that it was time\nto dance with some arrogant prince who can\u2019t keep his hands to himself. Then,\nby the blessings of the Gods, an idea popped into her pretty little mind. She\nslowly lifted her burning cheek away from the icy cold armor and gazed upon\nSeokjin. Seokjin furrowed his brows, wondering what his princess wanted. Then,\nit hit him. He was about to dance the famous dance in front of millions of\nroyal people.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour\nfather is not going to wait any longer, my lovely daughter.\u201d The two of them\nheard the king say jokingly, earning himself a few polite chuckles. </p><p>Sumin exhaled deeply and then held out her left\nhand, smiling sweetly at her knight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShall\nwe?\u201d She asked; her eyes never once leaving his. </p><p>Seokjin gently grabbed her hand and politely kissed\nit, \u201cWe shall.\u201d </p><p>A roar of applause sounded throughout the large\nroom as Sumin and Seokjin left the comfortable confinements that was their\nlittle corner wall. Seokjin felt the envious gazes hitting his entire body; he\ncouldn\u2019t help but smirk proudly as he did. It was not every day where a lowly\nknight got to share the special dance with a princess. </p><p>After what it seemed like forever, walking through\nmany groups of people, Sumin and Seokjin took their position, right in the\ncenter of the dance floor. With their hands interlocked with one another, their\nbreathing grew heavy as the nerves slowly swallowed them whole. They would be\nthe second couple ever to execute such a special dance. Sumin\u2019s parents were\nthe first. </p><p>With patient hearts and jagged breathing, the\nanxious pair mentally counted down the beats before taking the first step.\nTheir eyes remained locked onto each other, neither one of them wavering their\nestablished contact. Their bodies moved as one as they danced inside the wall\nof people that surrounded them. A light gush of wind gently fanned their faces\nas Sumin and Seokjin continued to simply smile at each other, not saying a\nword. Their stares did all the talking for them. </p><p>They continued to dance as they became oblivious to\ntheir surroundings. The distinguishable faces became blurred as the bodies\ndisappeared one by one. Soon, it was just the two of them. The lavish golds and\nsilvers were the only guests in that ballroom now. One must not forget the tints\nof rose in the walls either. </p><p>Seokjin twirled Sumin, smiling warmly as his brown\neyes bored into hers. His hand never one unlocking with hers as he pulled her\nback. Her skirt raising slightly as Sumin\u2019s entire body spun around, creating a\nlight breeze. </p><p>A soft giggle left Sumin\u2019s innocent lips as she\nreturned to her rightful place\u2014 against Seokjin\u2019s body. Her right fingers\ninterlaced with his left as her left hand was placed firmly on his shoulder\nwhile his right hand was anchored on her waist. </p><p>Nothing but the look of complete adoration was\npresent in the two eyes as the song neared the end. As the final note\nproceeded, Seokjin dipped low as he mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d, to her before\nlifting her up. </p><p>The sound of applause and cheers echoed throughout\nthe castle as Seokjin and Sumin bowed and curtsied to their audience. After\nacknowledging the last section of the crowd, Seokjin leaned down and whispered\nsomething enticing in Sumin\u2019s ear. She quickly masked her pleasing smile with\none of total professionalism. She then turned to Seokjin and slowly licked her\nlips before nodded eagerly yet subtly. She tightened her hold on his hand\nbefore politely excusing herself to her parents. Her parents saw a <i>certain </i>gleam in her eye and chuckled.\nThey knew that look in Seokjin and Sumin\u2019s eyes as they walked quickly out of\nthe ballroom. They were young once and boy did they rush off to their secret\nhiding places to\u2014 have a little bit of fun. </p><p>Not wanting to raise suspicions or a sense of\nworry, the king clapped his hands and demanded that the party continue. The\nquiet room was soon filled with lively music as the once frozen people finally\nleft their spots and filled the dance floor. Soon, happy chatter and polite\nchuckles floated into the air and mixed with the sounds of the orchestra. </p><p>On the other hand, in a different part of the\ncastle, a dimly lit room was filled with the sound of messy kisses and articles\nof clothing dropping to the floor. The skin-on-skin contact ignited a flame of\narousal within Sumin and Seokjin. The sense of urgency caused the two lovers to\nnot care about their outfits when they were practically ripping them off one\nanother. A tattered corset laid on the floor as Sumin\u2019s bare back was firmly pressed\nagainst the cold stone wall. Her hands were raised above her head as Seokjin\u2019s\nmouth was latched onto her beautiful breasts. </p><p>With one nipple in his mouth and the other being\nmassaged by his free hand, Seokjin twirled and pulled the nub in between his\nteeth. Hearing Sumin\u2019s precious moans only fueled his hormones and increased\nhis need to take her virginity. His need to possess Sumin in ways that only a\nlover could do. His need to remind her that she was his. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d\nSumin moaned as her eyes rolled to the back of her head, taking in the pleasure\nthat she was receiving. She felt her core become soaked as she craved <i>something</i> to be inside of her. </p><p>Seokjin continued to assault her breasts as his\nfree hand soon left her chest and slowly trailed down her torso. His fingers\nlightly tickling down her naval before reaching the waist of her skirt. He then\ndecided to tease his princess just a bit, playing with the material as if he\nwas going to undo the ties and let it drop it down.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir\nknight\u2026 please do not tease me\u2026\u201d Sumin whined; her bundle of nerves throbbing\ndesperately. </p><p>Seokjin smirked against her stomach, having left\nher breasts minutes ago, \u201cOh? Is the princess sounding needy? Maybe she needs\nto actually beg if she wants to be touched down there\u2026\u201d </p><p>Sumin\u2019s eyes shot open as she lifted her head away\nfrom the wall. Her gaze locked onto Seokjin as she unknowingly constricted her\nwalls; the desire for something or <i>someone</i>\nto be inside of her grew stronger. Was she seriously thinking about giving up\nher pride as a princess and beg to be touched? Maybe just this once.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease\nSeokjin. Please touch me\u2026\u201d She paused as an airy moan flew out her lips. \u201cMake\nme feel something indescribable that has me a moaning mess.\u201d Sumin begged\nbefore licking her precious lips slowly, enticing him to take what he so\ndesperately craved. </p><p>Seokjin cocked up his brow, lips slightly ajar as\nhis breathing grew heavy. Hearing her begging, pleading for him to touch her\nturned on something in his handsome mind. Was this how a pair of intimate\nlovers behaved? Was this how they displayed true feelings of love with one\nanother? Whatever was bound to happen, he was happy that he was sharing this\nmoment with his precious Sumin. His everything. </p><p>With the sound of light pants and tiny whimpers,\nSumin mentally prepared herself what was about to happen. It was no secret that\nshe eavesdropped on the saucy gossip from her chamber maids and other castle\nworkers. She specially paid attention to the erotic tales that they happily\ngiggled over. Now, it was her moment to shine. It was time for to experience\nthe unspeakable flash of white that the maids spoke of numerous of times. It\nwas time for her feel this sudden wave of euphoria. It was time to become a\nwoman. </p><p>Steadying her racing her heart, Sumin bit her\nbottom lip as she felt his hands slowly trail up her bare thigh. The roughness\nfrom his fingers sent goosebumps on her arms as his fingers lightly danced on\nher skin. </p><p>A small whimper managed to escape her lips as Sumin\nfelt his fingers gradually close the gap. Before she knew it, Seokjin was\ntouching her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ngod\u2026\u201d Seokjin cursed as his fingers were quickly coated with her juices. That\nwas how aroused she was. </p><p>His fingers continued to trace her folds, wanting\nto memorize every detail of her womanhood. He too started to bite his bottom\nlip as he tried to contain his raging hormones. He wanted to wait for their\nwedding night to take her virginity, however, that idea left his mind the\nmoment he encountered her soaking wet core. His index and middle fingers\naccidentally grazed her entrance as they were softly rubbing her pussy. Feeling\nher soaking wet entrance was enough reason for Seokjin to at least give her a\ntiny taste of what it was like to have something inside. He caressed her\nentrance once more before slowly inserting his index finger, careful to take\nnote of her discomfort. His pace started off slow, giving her some time to get\nused to his finger. As soon as her face contorted to a look of pleasure, he\ninserted his middle finger, stretching her virgin walls out. </p><p>Sumin rested her head back on the wall as her hand\nmagically found its way in his hear. She began to tug against the roots as he\npumped his index finger in and out. His thumb rubbed her bundle of nerves,\nsending jolt after jolt of pleasure throughout his princess.</p><p>Her lips were agape as the soft pants mixed with\nmoans fueled her desire to touch him. It was not fair that she was receiving\nthis insane amount of pleasure, and he wasn\u2019t getting anything in return. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nl-love\u2026\u201d She whispered, though, it was difficult since he was still fingering\nher. </p><p>Seokjin continued to thrust his fingers, \u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>A tiny whine left her lips. \u201cIt is not fair that I\nam on the receiving end of our first intimate moment.\u201d Sumin placed her index\nfinger underneath his chin and gently tilted it up. \u201cPermit me to pleasure\nyou.\u201d She smiled alluring. </p><p>Seokjin felt his member twitch in excitement. Holy\nshit. That smile and the fact that she wanted to touch him was making it much\nharder on him to not throw her on the bed and take her now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\ndo not have to, Sumin. It is my duty to make sure that the princess is well\ntaken care.\u201d He teased; his fingers picking up the pace, earning himself a\ncouple of loud moans from her. </p><p>In that split second, hearing that deep tone in his\nvoice, sent an unspeakable chill down her spine. Sumin knew that she was\nvulnerable. She was a prey. She was simply putty in his fingers. </p><p>Back in the ballroom, Sumin\u2019s parents were in a\nheated discussion with King Ji Yong. They tried every excuse in the book to try\nand sway his mind, however, Ji Yong wasn\u2019t going to give up on <i>his</i> princess. Ji Yong was no fool. He\nknew of Sumin\u2019s kingdom\u2019s customs. He knew that that he had to prove himself\nworthy of her in order to be granted permission to wed her by her parents. The\nfun question was, how? How was he going to earn Sumin\u2019s favor when he knows\nsomething was going between her and her personal knight? Ji Yong especially\nobserved the knight\u2019s lip movement while they were dancing sweetly. He saw the\nlowly knight mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d, to Sumin. Something about that irked him,\nbut he couldn\u2019t understand. At least not yet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nhave made up my mind. I would like to stay in the castle and take the time to\nprove myself to the Princess Sumin.\u201d Ji Yong said, looking a tad disinterested.\n</p><p>The king and queen looked to one another, hoping\nthat either one of them would have another excuse on why that would be horrible.\nUnfortunately, they could not think of an excuse. That was one of the loopholes\nthat previous generations have yet to find a solution for. While the prince or\nprincess may have made up his or her mind on who he or she is marrying, another\nsuitor was free to still try and win over the affections of the prince or\nprincess. </p><p>With a heavy sigh, the king met the Ji Yong\u2019s gaze\nand courageously stared him down. No matter what, the happiness of his daughter\nis his top priority. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe\nqueen and I grant you permission to stay in one of our many guest suites during\nyour stay here. I do have to warn you though, that it might be quite difficult\nto win our daughter\u2019s affections as she is not like any other princesses\nthroughout the nation. She is headstrong, intelligent, and charismatic.\u201d The\nking said, trying one last time to turn Ji Yong off from Sumin. </p><p>A sly smile graced his handsome face as Ji Yong\u2019s\neyes sparked with someone unreadable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPerfect.\u201d\n</p><p>Amidst the hard attempts of Sumin\u2019s parents trying\nto convince King Ji Yong to reconsider his marriage proposal, the young lovers\nwere busy filling the room with the sounds of heavy breathing, moaning, and\nloving whispers. </p><p>Seokjin upgraded from simply using his hands to\nusing his hands and his mouth. His tongue flicked and twirled around her\nsensitive nub while his fingers continued to thrust into her. Her sweet smell\nclouded his mind as his throbbing member ached to be in his fingers\u2019 position.\nHis hardened length desperately wanting to be the one feeling her walls clench\naround it; her juices coating him continuously. </p><p>Whimper after whimper. Moan after moan. Pant after\npant. Those were the only sounds happening during their passionate rendezvous.<b></b></p><p>Sumin\u2019s breathing grew rapid as the pleasure built\nup in the pit of her stomach. Her walls began to constrict around his fingers\nas the desire for some form of a release drew closer and closer. This was not\nfair. She wanted to touch him and please him. However, before her mind could\nfocus more on that thought, a sudden sense of happiness rushed throughout her\nbody. Did she experience what the female castle workers called an \u201corgasm\u201d?\nWell, whatever it was, she loved the feeling it gave her. She loved it even\nmore since it was Seokjin who gave her that high. </p><p>Now, with his fingers dripping from her precious\njuices, he decided to give himself a little bit of attention. Seeing her come\nundone like that caused his member to harden even more. It was practically\npressing against the fabric of his trousers. That was how aroused he was. Plus,\nit didn\u2019t help that her <i>smell</i> was\nstill flooding his senses. Every time he took a breath, her sweet aroma came\ncrashing in, sending his hormones into a crazed frenzy. </p><p>His hand quickly undid the belt and then reached\ninside. His aching member twitched even more at the sudden warm contact. With\nher juices coating his fingers, he slowly rubbed his shaft, mixing his pre-cum\nwith her cum. </p><p>Before he could speed up his pace, he felt a\nfamiliar hand on top of his. His lips were captured as well. </p><p>Once she came down her high and regained her\nsenses, her vision locked onto Seokjin. Her eyes trailed down as she noticed\nhis hand moving up and down at a rapid pace.</p><p>Wanting to return the favor, Sumin crawled up to\nhim and placed her dainty hand on top of his. She then captured his beautiful\nlips before he could protest. </p><p>Swallowing his moans, Sumin focused on pleasuring\nthe man in front of him. She wanted him to feel the same high as she felt. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh\nmy\u2026 at this rate, you are going to make me release\u2026\u201d Seokjin moaned as his head\nflew back. His eyes rolled to the back of his head as well. </p><p>Sumin smirked as she hovered her lips over his ear,\n\u201cGood. I want you to feel good my lord.\u201d </p><p>With one simple phrase, Seokjin released. Tiny\nstrips of white shot out, painting Sumin\u2019s hand as she her rubbing slowed down.\n</p><p>A goofy grin graced Seokjin\u2019s handsome face as he\ncame down his euphoric high. He tucked his soft member back inside his trousers\nbefore standing up and finding a cloth to clean up Sumin. </p><p>After searching for a good couple of minutes,\nSeokjin managed to find a white handkerchief and walked back to his princess.\nHe handed the cloth to her as he pressed his lips sweetly against her temple. </p><p>Sumin muttered a quick thank you before wiping off\nany traces of intimacy from her hand. Once her hands were clean, Sumin stared\nat her tattered corset as she wondered how on Earth was she going to explain to\nher mother and father that her undergarment was no longer presence. </p><p>Seokjin noticed Sumin\u2019s brow furrow; a habit she\ndid whenever she thought long and hard about something, \u201cWhat is the matter, my\nlove?\u201d </p><p>Sumin gestured to her corset, \u201cHow am I going to\nexplain to my parents that my corset is destroyed?\u201d</p><p>Seokjin chuckled, \u201cWell, would it ease your mind\nthat I asked your nurse to prepare a second dress for you?\u201d </p><p>Sumin raised her brow, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d</p><p>The joyous celebration continued into the early\nhours into next day. No one showed signs of wanting to leave the birthday\nparty. After all, it is not every day one gets to witness a princess become a\nwoman. </p><p>A mixture of loud instruments filled the ballroom\nas the princess finished her rounds of dancing with every eligible suitor that\nattended her party. Unfortunately, her mind was still preoccupied on the events\nthat took place before she walked back into the ballroom\u2014 wearing an entirely\ndifferent dress. </p><p>Lucky for her, no one seemed to mind or cared\nenough to say something to her. However, would anyone want to accuse the\nprincess of something while he or she was in <i>her</i> kingdom? Probably not. </p><p>Graciously moving across the dancefloor, Sumin\nsmiled politely and maintained eye contact with the princes she was currently\ndancing with. With dark raven colored locks, and his dark brown eyes piercing\ninto hers, she continued to make tiny conversations with the annoying prince.\nJungkook, she believed to be his name. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAm\nI boring you princess? You do not seem too keen on my talk of my many\nachievements.\u201d Sumin heard the arrogant prince say. </p><p>She quickly mustered a sincere smile, \u201cOh, forgive\nmy lord, I was just getting hypnotized by your smile.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her compliment boosted his pride. Maybe he\nwas going to have the honor of marrying the princess. Unlike his fellow\nprinces, who were currently eyeing him with pure envy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\nHas the princess fallen for my charms?\u201d Jungkook inquired, displaying a smile\nthat would make any other princess swoon. </p><p>Sumin fought the urge to gag, \u201cOf course. What kind\nof princess do you take me for?\u201d </p><p>Jungkook cocked up his brow, thinking, \u201cA strong\nmind\u2026 I like it.\u201d</p><p>The two of them continued to dance all across the\nballroom, earning themselves a wave of compliments. The many onlookers smiled\nand admired how Sumin and Jungkook looked together. Something in their combined\naura that made the idea of a union between them favorable, especially with\nJungkook\u2019s parents. </p><p>As the song played the last notes, Sumin politely\ncurtsied to Jungkook while Jungkook returned the favor by bowing to her. Before\nparting ways, Jungkook gently took her hand and placed a chaste kiss on her\nknuckles. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGoodnight,\nprincess.\u201d He winked at her before walking over to his parents.</p><p>Sumin maintained her diplomatic smile until he was\nfar enough away for her to drop it. She let out a small groan before graciously\nwalking over to Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin smirked and looked down on his princess,\nstill having their little steamy meeting embedded in his mind. He secretly\nkissed her soft cheek as he asked her how her little love dance with Prince\nJungkook went. </p><p>Sumin rolled her eyes, \u201cOh, it was magical. Now, I\nam going to my mother and father that it is Prince Jungkook I want to marry and\nhave many children with.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin chuckled deeply, \u201cDo not be like, my\nprincess. I was simply teasing.\u201d</p><p>Just as Sumin was about to retaliate, she heard her\nfather give the announcement that the party celebration was officially over.\nShe then, out of the corner of her eye, noticed him gesturing to her and\nSeokjin. </p><p>The two lovers looked to one another; their brows\nknitted together. Her father\u2019s current expression was unsettling. Something\nhorrific was about to happen, but what. </p><p>Now settled in her father\u2019s office chambers, Sumin,\nwho was resting her head against Seokjin\u2019s shoulder, eyed her parents with pure\nconcern. Her heart raced as her stomach did somersaults while patiently\nawaiting the news from her father. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nlovely daughter\u2026 you know that your mother and I want nothing but the best for\nyou, especially when it comes to choosing your future husband.\u201d Her father\nbegan, trying to find the right words to say next. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\nis happening, papa?\u201d Sumin interrupted as she gripped her hold on Seokjin\u2019s\nhand, feeling afraid that something or <i>someone</i>\nwas going to tear them apart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo\nyou remember meeting King Kwon Ji Yong at the party tonight?\u201d Her father asked.\n</p><p>Both Seokjin and Sumin nodded.</p><p>The king exhaled deeply before baring the terrible\nnews.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\nhas taken it upon himself to invite himself to stay in the castle as our guest\nas he has expressed deep desire to make you his wife.\u201d </p><p>Sumin gasped, suddenly losing all oxygen in her\nlungs. She quickly latched onto the pendant that Seokjin gifted her on her\nfifteenth birthday with a look of complete dread etched on her face.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow\nlong does King Ji Yong plan to stay with us?\u201d Sumin asked softly as Seokjin\nuttered nothing but loving words in her ear, hoping to ease her worries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHowever\nlong it will take for you to agree to be his wife.\u201d Her other responded,\nfeeling her own break for her daughter. </p><p>Sumin frowned as she buried her face in Seokjin\u2019s\nchest, hating the idea of marrying someone else that was not her knight.</p><p>Seokjin, on the other hand, was fuming on the\ninside. He was not happy whatsoever with some random king marrying his\nprincess. They were childhood friends. They were blooming lovers. They had <i>history</i>. No one could ever come close to\nSumin for him. She was it. Now? He knew that he must do something and quick. He\nand Sumin had talked about waiting a few more years and was only granted that\nrequest earlier in the day. This was all wrong. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nmajesties, may I request that the princess and I relinquish our wish to wed in\na few years\u2019 time?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMay\nI ask why?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwant to marry the princess Sumin as soon as possible.\u201d </p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Well how do you like this chapter now?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn? </small></p><p><small>\n\n\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>\u00a0<br></small></p><p><small>\n\n\u203b <b>Next Time:</b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small><br></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 2: Time is of the Essence </i></h2>[[MORE]]<p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin mocked her\ntone, \u201cFine, if you marry one of them, then I will marry one of your mother\u2019s\nladies in waiting.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Sumin gasped and\nglared coldly at him, \u201cWhich one and I will see to it that she is fired.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Seokjin chuckled\ndeeply, still finding it fun to push her buttons. The playful knight and the\nteasing princess continued to tease one another, both not showing signs of\nceasing. </i></p><p><i>While the playful\ncouple was enjoying their own little world, the king and queen eyed them with\ncuriosity in their gaze. They were too absorbed with watching their daughter\nand her knight joke around with each other that they failed to realize that\nthere was a royal presence lingering in the air. </i></p><p><i>Soon, the\nmysterious person cleared his throat, gaining the attention of the king and\nqueen. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAh, King Ji Yong, to what do the\nqueen and I owe the pleasure of your presence on the eve of my daughter\u2019s\nbirthday celebration?\u201d The king spoke in a diplomatic voice.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have come to ask for your\ndaughter\u2019s hand in marriage.\u201d </i></p><p>A blanket of confusion fell upon the royal parents.\nBlank expressions and a few eye blinks. The king and queen\u2019s gazes fell onto\neach other as they grew unsure what to do or even want to say. They were\ncertainly speechless. </p><p>King Kwon Ji Yong, on the other hand, was awaiting\ntheir responses. The moment he sat foot in the castle, he felt a surge of\nwarmth flow through his veins. His heart felt light. His cold, emotionless face\nfinally achieved something that he, himself, thought he would not have the\nability to do. He smiled\u2014 and it was all thanks to Princess Sumin. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\ndo I have permission to court your daughter and perhaps propose marriage?\u201d Ji\nYong asked; his patience running a bit thin. </p><p>The king stared seriously at the fellow ruler. He\nhas heard rumors of Ji Yong\u2019s harsh tactics, and his borderline dictatorship\nover his kingdom. Did he honestly want his daughter marrying such a tyrant? Oh,\nhe could not forget King Ji Yong\u2019s wandering hand. Ji Yong was notorious for having\na new mistress every week and being not able to commit to a relationship. Even\nwhile his parents were alive and well, Ji Yong would dismiss his arranged\nmarriages and simply bed a chamber maid like it was nothing. </p><p>The more he thought about, the more Sumin\u2019s father\ngrew against the idea of Ji Yong marrying his precious jewel. Yeah. Ji Yong was\nnot allowed to marry Sumin nor will he <i>ever</i>\nhave his permission. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwill talk it over with my wife and seriously think about it. Since it is my\ndaughter\u2019s eighteenth birthday celebration, I would rather not discuss\nimportant diplomatic decisions on this joyous occasion.\u201d Sumin\u2019s father paused,\nholding out his right hand for his wife to take. \u201cNow, if you excuse me, the\nwife and I have to make an appearance on the ballroom floor.\u201d He bowed politely\nbefore standing up with his wife by his side. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s parents smiled politely before brushing\npast him and making their way through the sea of partygoers. </p><p>Ji Yong watched them disappear into the crowds of\npeople. A light humming emitted from his lips as a devious thought appeared to\nin his mind. He rubbed his chin as the plan developed more and more. His mind\nhad been made up already. He was going to take the Princess Sumin as his wife\nand no one was going to stop him. </p><p>Completely in the center of the grand ballroom, the\nking and queen signaled the orchestra to change the lively tune into the song\nthat was used for the traditional coming of age dance. That specific dance was\npassed down from generation to generation in Sumin\u2019s family and tonight was no\nexception. </p><p>With a single wave, the violinists and cello player\npicked up their bow and began to the play. The somber notes echoed throughout\nthe luxurious room. The mixture of high notes and low notes caused a weird sense\nof relaxation amongst the people. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\nis time for the ceremonial dance. Princess Sumin, come hither please. Oh! Bring\nyour suitor of choice as your partner.\u201d The king announced; his line of sight\naligning up with his daughter, who was busy burying her face in the cold metal\nof Seokjin\u2019s armor. </p><p>Princess Sumin groaned as she knew that it was time\nto dance with some arrogant prince who can\u2019t keep his hands to himself. Then,\nby the blessings of the Gods, an idea popped into her pretty little mind. She\nslowly lifted her burning cheek away from the icy cold armor and gazed upon\nSeokjin. Seokjin furrowed his brows, wondering what his princess wanted. Then,\nit hit him. He was about to dance the famous dance in front of millions of\nroyal people.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour\nfather is not going to wait any longer, my lovely daughter.\u201d The two of them\nheard the king say jokingly, earning himself a few polite chuckles. </p><p>Sumin exhaled deeply and then held out her left\nhand, smiling sweetly at her knight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShall\nwe?\u201d She asked; her eyes never once leaving his. </p><p>Seokjin gently grabbed her hand and politely kissed\nit, \u201cWe shall.\u201d </p><p>A roar of applause sounded throughout the large\nroom as Sumin and Seokjin left the comfortable confinements that was their\nlittle corner wall. Seokjin felt the envious gazes hitting his entire body; he\ncouldn\u2019t help but smirk proudly as he did. It was not every day where a lowly\nknight got to share the special dance with a princess. </p><p>After what it seemed like forever, walking through\nmany groups of people, Sumin and Seokjin took their position, right in the\ncenter of the dance floor. With their hands interlocked with one another, their\nbreathing grew heavy as the nerves slowly swallowed them whole. They would be\nthe second couple ever to execute such a special dance. Sumin\u2019s parents were\nthe first. </p><p>With patient hearts and jagged breathing, the\nanxious pair mentally counted down the beats before taking the first step.\nTheir eyes remained locked onto each other, neither one of them wavering their\nestablished contact. Their bodies moved as one as they danced inside the wall\nof people that surrounded them. A light gush of wind gently fanned their faces\nas Sumin and Seokjin continued to simply smile at each other, not saying a\nword. Their stares did all the talking for them. </p><p>They continued to dance as they became oblivious to\ntheir surroundings. The distinguishable faces became blurred as the bodies\ndisappeared one by one. Soon, it was just the two of them. The lavish golds and\nsilvers were the only guests in that ballroom now. One must not forget the tints\nof rose in the walls either. </p><p>Seokjin twirled Sumin, smiling warmly as his brown\neyes bored into hers. His hand never one unlocking with hers as he pulled her\nback. Her skirt raising slightly as Sumin\u2019s entire body spun around, creating a\nlight breeze. </p><p>A soft giggle left Sumin\u2019s innocent lips as she\nreturned to her rightful place\u2014 against Seokjin\u2019s body. Her right fingers\ninterlaced with his left as her left hand was placed firmly on his shoulder\nwhile his right hand was anchored on her waist. </p><p>Nothing but the look of complete adoration was\npresent in the two eyes as the song neared the end. As the final note\nproceeded, Seokjin dipped low as he mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d, to her before\nlifting her up. </p><p>The sound of applause and cheers echoed throughout\nthe castle as Seokjin and Sumin bowed and curtsied to their audience. After\nacknowledging the last section of the crowd, Seokjin leaned down and whispered\nsomething enticing in Sumin\u2019s ear. She quickly masked her pleasing smile with\none of total professionalism. She then turned to Seokjin and slowly licked her\nlips before nodded eagerly yet subtly. She tightened her hold on his hand\nbefore politely excusing herself to her parents. Her parents saw a <i>certain </i>gleam in her eye and chuckled.\nThey knew that look in Seokjin and Sumin\u2019s eyes as they walked quickly out of\nthe ballroom. They were young once and boy did they rush off to their secret\nhiding places to\u2014 have a little bit of fun. </p><p>Not wanting to raise suspicions or a sense of\nworry, the king clapped his hands and demanded that the party continue. The\nquiet room was soon filled with lively music as the once frozen people finally\nleft their spots and filled the dance floor. Soon, happy chatter and polite\nchuckles floated into the air and mixed with the sounds of the orchestra. </p><p>On the other hand, in a different part of the\ncastle, a dimly lit room was filled with the sound of messy kisses and articles\nof clothing dropping to the floor. The skin-on-skin contact ignited a flame of\narousal within Sumin and Seokjin. The sense of urgency caused the two lovers to\nnot care about their outfits when they were practically ripping them off one\nanother. A tattered corset laid on the floor as Sumin\u2019s bare back was firmly pressed\nagainst the cold stone wall. Her hands were raised above her head as Seokjin\u2019s\nmouth was latched onto her beautiful breasts. </p><p>With one nipple in his mouth and the other being\nmassaged by his free hand, Seokjin twirled and pulled the nub in between his\nteeth. Hearing Sumin\u2019s precious moans only fueled his hormones and increased\nhis need to take her virginity. His need to possess Sumin in ways that only a\nlover could do. His need to remind her that she was his. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d\nSumin moaned as her eyes rolled to the back of her head, taking in the pleasure\nthat she was receiving. She felt her core become soaked as she craved <i>something</i> to be inside of her. </p><p>Seokjin continued to assault her breasts as his\nfree hand soon left her chest and slowly trailed down her torso. His fingers\nlightly tickling down her naval before reaching the waist of her skirt. He then\ndecided to tease his princess just a bit, playing with the material as if he\nwas going to undo the ties and let it drop it down.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir\nknight\u2026 please do not tease me\u2026\u201d Sumin whined; her bundle of nerves throbbing\ndesperately. </p><p>Seokjin smirked against her stomach, having left\nher breasts minutes ago, \u201cOh? Is the princess sounding needy? Maybe she needs\nto actually beg if she wants to be touched down there\u2026\u201d </p><p>Sumin\u2019s eyes shot open as she lifted her head away\nfrom the wall. Her gaze locked onto Seokjin as she unknowingly constricted her\nwalls; the desire for something or <i>someone</i>\nto be inside of her grew stronger. Was she seriously thinking about giving up\nher pride as a princess and beg to be touched? Maybe just this once.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease\nSeokjin. Please touch me\u2026\u201d She paused as an airy moan flew out her lips. \u201cMake\nme feel something indescribable that has me a moaning mess.\u201d Sumin begged\nbefore licking her precious lips slowly, enticing him to take what he so\ndesperately craved. </p><p>Seokjin cocked up his brow, lips slightly ajar as\nhis breathing grew heavy. Hearing her begging, pleading for him to touch her\nturned on something in his handsome mind. Was this how a pair of intimate\nlovers behaved? Was this how they displayed true feelings of love with one\nanother? Whatever was bound to happen, he was happy that he was sharing this\nmoment with his precious Sumin. His everything. </p><p>With the sound of light pants and tiny whimpers,\nSumin mentally prepared herself what was about to happen. It was no secret that\nshe eavesdropped on the saucy gossip from her chamber maids and other castle\nworkers. She specially paid attention to the erotic tales that they happily\ngiggled over. Now, it was her moment to shine. It was time for to experience\nthe unspeakable flash of white that the maids spoke of numerous of times. It\nwas time for her feel this sudden wave of euphoria. It was time to become a\nwoman. </p><p>Steadying her racing her heart, Sumin bit her\nbottom lip as she felt his hands slowly trail up her bare thigh. The roughness\nfrom his fingers sent goosebumps on her arms as his fingers lightly danced on\nher skin. </p><p>A small whimper managed to escape her lips as Sumin\nfelt his fingers gradually close the gap. Before she knew it, Seokjin was\ntouching her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ngod\u2026\u201d Seokjin cursed as his fingers were quickly coated with her juices. That\nwas how aroused she was. </p><p>His fingers continued to trace her folds, wanting\nto memorize every detail of her womanhood. He too started to bite his bottom\nlip as he tried to contain his raging hormones. He wanted to wait for their\nwedding night to take her virginity, however, that idea left his mind the\nmoment he encountered her soaking wet core. His index and middle fingers\naccidentally grazed her entrance as they were softly rubbing her pussy. Feeling\nher soaking wet entrance was enough reason for Seokjin to at least give her a\ntiny taste of what it was like to have something inside. He caressed her\nentrance once more before slowly inserting his index finger, careful to take\nnote of her discomfort. His pace started off slow, giving her some time to get\nused to his finger. As soon as her face contorted to a look of pleasure, he\ninserted his middle finger, stretching her virgin walls out. </p><p>Sumin rested her head back on the wall as her hand\nmagically found its way in his hear. She began to tug against the roots as he\npumped his index finger in and out. His thumb rubbed her bundle of nerves,\nsending jolt after jolt of pleasure throughout his princess.</p><p>Her lips were agape as the soft pants mixed with\nmoans fueled her desire to touch him. It was not fair that she was receiving\nthis insane amount of pleasure, and he wasn\u2019t getting anything in return. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nl-love\u2026\u201d She whispered, though, it was difficult since he was still fingering\nher. </p><p>Seokjin continued to thrust his fingers, \u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>A tiny whine left her lips. \u201cIt is not fair that I\nam on the receiving end of our first intimate moment.\u201d Sumin placed her index\nfinger underneath his chin and gently tilted it up. \u201cPermit me to pleasure\nyou.\u201d She smiled alluring. </p><p>Seokjin felt his member twitch in excitement. Holy\nshit. That smile and the fact that she wanted to touch him was making it much\nharder on him to not throw her on the bed and take her now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\ndo not have to, Sumin. It is my duty to make sure that the princess is well\ntaken care.\u201d He teased; his fingers picking up the pace, earning himself a\ncouple of loud moans from her. </p><p>In that split second, hearing that deep tone in his\nvoice, sent an unspeakable chill down her spine. Sumin knew that she was\nvulnerable. She was a prey. She was simply putty in his fingers. </p><p>Back in the ballroom, Sumin\u2019s parents were in a\nheated discussion with King Ji Yong. They tried every excuse in the book to try\nand sway his mind, however, Ji Yong wasn\u2019t going to give up on <i>his</i> princess. Ji Yong was no fool. He\nknew of Sumin\u2019s kingdom\u2019s customs. He knew that that he had to prove himself\nworthy of her in order to be granted permission to wed her by her parents. The\nfun question was, how? How was he going to earn Sumin\u2019s favor when he knows\nsomething was going between her and her personal knight? Ji Yong especially\nobserved the knight\u2019s lip movement while they were dancing sweetly. He saw the\nlowly knight mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d, to Sumin. Something about that irked him,\nbut he couldn\u2019t understand. At least not yet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nhave made up my mind. I would like to stay in the castle and take the time to\nprove myself to the Princess Sumin.\u201d Ji Yong said, looking a tad disinterested.\n</p><p>The king and queen looked to one another, hoping\nthat either one of them would have another excuse on why that would be horrible.\nUnfortunately, they could not think of an excuse. That was one of the loopholes\nthat previous generations have yet to find a solution for. While the prince or\nprincess may have made up his or her mind on who he or she is marrying, another\nsuitor was free to still try and win over the affections of the prince or\nprincess. </p><p>With a heavy sigh, the king met the Ji Yong\u2019s gaze\nand courageously stared him down. No matter what, the happiness of his daughter\nis his top priority. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe\nqueen and I grant you permission to stay in one of our many guest suites during\nyour stay here. I do have to warn you though, that it might be quite difficult\nto win our daughter\u2019s affections as she is not like any other princesses\nthroughout the nation. She is headstrong, intelligent, and charismatic.\u201d The\nking said, trying one last time to turn Ji Yong off from Sumin. </p><p>A sly smile graced his handsome face as Ji Yong\u2019s\neyes sparked with someone unreadable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPerfect.\u201d\n</p><p>Amidst the hard attempts of Sumin\u2019s parents trying\nto convince King Ji Yong to reconsider his marriage proposal, the young lovers\nwere busy filling the room with the sounds of heavy breathing, moaning, and\nloving whispers. </p><p>Seokjin upgraded from simply using his hands to\nusing his hands and his mouth. His tongue flicked and twirled around her\nsensitive nub while his fingers continued to thrust into her. Her sweet smell\nclouded his mind as his throbbing member ached to be in his fingers\u2019 position.\nHis hardened length desperately wanting to be the one feeling her walls clench\naround it; her juices coating him continuously. </p><p>Whimper after whimper. Moan after moan. Pant after\npant. Those were the only sounds happening during their passionate rendezvous.<b></b></p><p>Sumin\u2019s breathing grew rapid as the pleasure built\nup in the pit of her stomach. Her walls began to constrict around his fingers\nas the desire for some form of a release drew closer and closer. This was not\nfair. She wanted to touch him and please him. However, before her mind could\nfocus more on that thought, a sudden sense of happiness rushed throughout her\nbody. Did she experience what the female castle workers called an \u201corgasm\u201d?\nWell, whatever it was, she loved the feeling it gave her. She loved it even\nmore since it was Seokjin who gave her that high. </p><p>Now, with his fingers dripping from her precious\njuices, he decided to give himself a little bit of attention. Seeing her come\nundone like that caused his member to harden even more. It was practically\npressing against the fabric of his trousers. That was how aroused he was. Plus,\nit didn\u2019t help that her <i>smell</i> was\nstill flooding his senses. Every time he took a breath, her sweet aroma came\ncrashing in, sending his hormones into a crazed frenzy. </p><p>His hand quickly undid the belt and then reached\ninside. His aching member twitched even more at the sudden warm contact. With\nher juices coating his fingers, he slowly rubbed his shaft, mixing his pre-cum\nwith her cum. </p><p>Before he could speed up his pace, he felt a\nfamiliar hand on top of his. His lips were captured as well. </p><p>Once she came down her high and regained her\nsenses, her vision locked onto Seokjin. Her eyes trailed down as she noticed\nhis hand moving up and down at a rapid pace.</p><p>Wanting to return the favor, Sumin crawled up to\nhim and placed her dainty hand on top of his. She then captured his beautiful\nlips before he could protest. </p><p>Swallowing his moans, Sumin focused on pleasuring\nthe man in front of him. She wanted him to feel the same high as she felt. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh\nmy\u2026 at this rate, you are going to make me release\u2026\u201d Seokjin moaned as his head\nflew back. His eyes rolled to the back of his head as well. </p><p>Sumin smirked as she hovered her lips over his ear,\n\u201cGood. I want you to feel good my lord.\u201d </p><p>With one simple phrase, Seokjin released. Tiny\nstrips of white shot out, painting Sumin\u2019s hand as she her rubbing slowed down.\n</p><p>A goofy grin graced Seokjin\u2019s handsome face as he\ncame down his euphoric high. He tucked his soft member back inside his trousers\nbefore standing up and finding a cloth to clean up Sumin. </p><p>After searching for a good couple of minutes,\nSeokjin managed to find a white handkerchief and walked back to his princess.\nHe handed the cloth to her as he pressed his lips sweetly against her temple. </p><p>Sumin muttered a quick thank you before wiping off\nany traces of intimacy from her hand. Once her hands were clean, Sumin stared\nat her tattered corset as she wondered how on Earth was she going to explain to\nher mother and father that her undergarment was no longer presence. </p><p>Seokjin noticed Sumin\u2019s brow furrow; a habit she\ndid whenever she thought long and hard about something, \u201cWhat is the matter, my\nlove?\u201d </p><p>Sumin gestured to her corset, \u201cHow am I going to\nexplain to my parents that my corset is destroyed?\u201d</p><p>Seokjin chuckled, \u201cWell, would it ease your mind\nthat I asked your nurse to prepare a second dress for you?\u201d </p><p>Sumin raised her brow, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d</p><p>The joyous celebration continued into the early\nhours into next day. No one showed signs of wanting to leave the birthday\nparty. After all, it is not every day one gets to witness a princess become a\nwoman. </p><p>A mixture of loud instruments filled the ballroom\nas the princess finished her rounds of dancing with every eligible suitor that\nattended her party. Unfortunately, her mind was still preoccupied on the events\nthat took place before she walked back into the ballroom\u2014 wearing an entirely\ndifferent dress. </p><p>Lucky for her, no one seemed to mind or cared\nenough to say something to her. However, would anyone want to accuse the\nprincess of something while he or she was in <i>her</i> kingdom? Probably not. </p><p>Graciously moving across the dancefloor, Sumin\nsmiled politely and maintained eye contact with the princes she was currently\ndancing with. With dark raven colored locks, and his dark brown eyes piercing\ninto hers, she continued to make tiny conversations with the annoying prince.\nJungkook, she believed to be his name. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAm\nI boring you princess? You do not seem too keen on my talk of my many\nachievements.\u201d Sumin heard the arrogant prince say. </p><p>She quickly mustered a sincere smile, \u201cOh, forgive\nmy lord, I was just getting hypnotized by your smile.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her compliment boosted his pride. Maybe he\nwas going to have the honor of marrying the princess. Unlike his fellow\nprinces, who were currently eyeing him with pure envy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh?\nHas the princess fallen for my charms?\u201d Jungkook inquired, displaying a smile\nthat would make any other princess swoon. </p><p>Sumin fought the urge to gag, \u201cOf course. What kind\nof princess do you take me for?\u201d </p><p>Jungkook cocked up his brow, thinking, \u201cA strong\nmind\u2026 I like it.\u201d</p><p>The two of them continued to dance all across the\nballroom, earning themselves a wave of compliments. The many onlookers smiled\nand admired how Sumin and Jungkook looked together. Something in their combined\naura that made the idea of a union between them favorable, especially with\nJungkook\u2019s parents. </p><p>As the song played the last notes, Sumin politely\ncurtsied to Jungkook while Jungkook returned the favor by bowing to her. Before\nparting ways, Jungkook gently took her hand and placed a chaste kiss on her\nknuckles. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGoodnight,\nprincess.\u201d He winked at her before walking over to his parents.</p><p>Sumin maintained her diplomatic smile until he was\nfar enough away for her to drop it. She let out a small groan before graciously\nwalking over to Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin smirked and looked down on his princess,\nstill having their little steamy meeting embedded in his mind. He secretly\nkissed her soft cheek as he asked her how her little love dance with Prince\nJungkook went. </p><p>Sumin rolled her eyes, \u201cOh, it was magical. Now, I\nam going to my mother and father that it is Prince Jungkook I want to marry and\nhave many children with.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin chuckled deeply, \u201cDo not be like, my\nprincess. I was simply teasing.\u201d</p><p>Just as Sumin was about to retaliate, she heard her\nfather give the announcement that the party celebration was officially over.\nShe then, out of the corner of her eye, noticed him gesturing to her and\nSeokjin. </p><p>The two lovers looked to one another; their brows\nknitted together. Her father\u2019s current expression was unsettling. Something\nhorrific was about to happen, but what. </p><p>Now settled in her father\u2019s office chambers, Sumin,\nwho was resting her head against Seokjin\u2019s shoulder, eyed her parents with pure\nconcern. Her heart raced as her stomach did somersaults while patiently\nawaiting the news from her father. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nlovely daughter\u2026 you know that your mother and I want nothing but the best for\nyou, especially when it comes to choosing your future husband.\u201d Her father\nbegan, trying to find the right words to say next. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\nis happening, papa?\u201d Sumin interrupted as she gripped her hold on Seokjin\u2019s\nhand, feeling afraid that something or <i>someone</i>\nwas going to tear them apart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo\nyou remember meeting King Kwon Ji Yong at the party tonight?\u201d Her father asked.\n</p><p>Both Seokjin and Sumin nodded.</p><p>The king exhaled deeply before baring the terrible\nnews.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe\nhas taken it upon himself to invite himself to stay in the castle as our guest\nas he has expressed deep desire to make you his wife.\u201d </p><p>Sumin gasped, suddenly losing all oxygen in her\nlungs. She quickly latched onto the pendant that Seokjin gifted her on her\nfifteenth birthday with a look of complete dread etched on her face.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow\nlong does King Ji Yong plan to stay with us?\u201d Sumin asked softly as Seokjin\nuttered nothing but loving words in her ear, hoping to ease her worries. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHowever\nlong it will take for you to agree to be his wife.\u201d Her other responded,\nfeeling her own break for her daughter. </p><p>Sumin frowned as she buried her face in Seokjin\u2019s\nchest, hating the idea of marrying someone else that was not her knight.</p><p>Seokjin, on the other hand, was fuming on the\ninside. He was not happy whatsoever with some random king marrying his\nprincess. They were childhood friends. They were blooming lovers. They had <i>history</i>. No one could ever come close to\nSumin for him. She was it. Now? He knew that he must do something and quick. He\nand Sumin had talked about waiting a few more years and was only granted that\nrequest earlier in the day. This was all wrong. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\nmajesties, may I request that the princess and I relinquish our wish to wed in\na few years\u2019 time?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMay\nI ask why?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwant to marry the princess Sumin as soon as possible.\u201d </p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Well how do you like this chapter now?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn? </small></p><p><small>\n\n&#8251; <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>&nbsp;<br /></small></p><p><small>\n\n&#8251; <b>Next Time:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small><br /></p><hr /><h2><i>Chapter 2: Time is of the Essence </i></h2><p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin mocked her\ntone, &ldquo;Fine, if you marry one of them, then I will marry one of your mother&rsquo;s\nladies in waiting.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Sumin gasped and\nglared coldly at him, &ldquo;Which one and I will see to it that she is fired.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Seokjin chuckled\ndeeply, still finding it fun to push her buttons. The playful knight and the\nteasing princess continued to tease one another, both not showing signs of\nceasing. </i></p><p><i>While the playful\ncouple was enjoying their own little world, the king and queen eyed them with\ncuriosity in their gaze. They were too absorbed with watching their daughter\nand her knight joke around with each other that they failed to realize that\nthere was a royal presence lingering in the air. </i></p><p><i>Soon, the\nmysterious person cleared his throat, gaining the attention of the king and\nqueen. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, King Ji Yong, to what do the\nqueen and I owe the pleasure of your presence on the eve of my daughter&rsquo;s\nbirthday celebration?&rdquo; The king spoke in a diplomatic voice.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I have come to ask for your\ndaughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage.&rdquo; </i></p><p>A blanket of confusion fell upon the royal parents.\nBlank expressions and a few eye blinks. The king and queen&rsquo;s gazes fell onto\neach other as they grew unsure what to do or even want to say. They were\ncertainly speechless. </p><p>King Kwon Ji Yong, on the other hand, was awaiting\ntheir responses. The moment he sat foot in the castle, he felt a surge of\nwarmth flow through his veins. His heart felt light. His cold, emotionless face\nfinally achieved something that he, himself, thought he would not have the\nability to do. He smiled&mdash; and it was all thanks to Princess Sumin. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well,\ndo I have permission to court your daughter and perhaps propose marriage?&rdquo; Ji\nYong asked; his patience running a bit thin. </p><p>The king stared seriously at the fellow ruler. He\nhas heard rumors of Ji Yong&rsquo;s harsh tactics, and his borderline dictatorship\nover his kingdom. Did he honestly want his daughter marrying such a tyrant? Oh,\nhe could not forget King Ji Yong&rsquo;s wandering hand. Ji Yong was notorious for having\na new mistress every week and being not able to commit to a relationship. Even\nwhile his parents were alive and well, Ji Yong would dismiss his arranged\nmarriages and simply bed a chamber maid like it was nothing. </p><p>The more he thought about, the more Sumin&rsquo;s father\ngrew against the idea of Ji Yong marrying his precious jewel. Yeah. Ji Yong was\nnot allowed to marry Sumin nor will he <i>ever</i>\nhave his permission. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I\nwill talk it over with my wife and seriously think about it. Since it is my\ndaughter&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday celebration, I would rather not discuss\nimportant diplomatic decisions on this joyous occasion.&rdquo; Sumin&rsquo;s father paused,\nholding out his right hand for his wife to take. &ldquo;Now, if you excuse me, the\nwife and I have to make an appearance on the ballroom floor.&rdquo; He bowed politely\nbefore standing up with his wife by his side. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s parents smiled politely before brushing\npast him and making their way through the sea of partygoers. </p><p>Ji Yong watched them disappear into the crowds of\npeople. A light humming emitted from his lips as a devious thought appeared to\nin his mind. He rubbed his chin as the plan developed more and more. His mind\nhad been made up already. He was going to take the Princess Sumin as his wife\nand no one was going to stop him. </p><p>Completely in the center of the grand ballroom, the\nking and queen signaled the orchestra to change the lively tune into the song\nthat was used for the traditional coming of age dance. That specific dance was\npassed down from generation to generation in Sumin&rsquo;s family and tonight was no\nexception. </p><p>With a single wave, the violinists and cello player\npicked up their bow and began to the play. The somber notes echoed throughout\nthe luxurious room. The mixture of high notes and low notes caused a weird sense\nof relaxation amongst the people. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It\nis time for the ceremonial dance. Princess Sumin, come hither please. Oh! Bring\nyour suitor of choice as your partner.&rdquo; The king announced; his line of sight\naligning up with his daughter, who was busy burying her face in the cold metal\nof Seokjin&rsquo;s armor. </p><p>Princess Sumin groaned as she knew that it was time\nto dance with some arrogant prince who can&rsquo;t keep his hands to himself. Then,\nby the blessings of the Gods, an idea popped into her pretty little mind. She\nslowly lifted her burning cheek away from the icy cold armor and gazed upon\nSeokjin. Seokjin furrowed his brows, wondering what his princess wanted. Then,\nit hit him. He was about to dance the famous dance in front of millions of\nroyal people.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your\nfather is not going to wait any longer, my lovely daughter.&rdquo; The two of them\nheard the king say jokingly, earning himself a few polite chuckles. </p><p>Sumin exhaled deeply and then held out her left\nhand, smiling sweetly at her knight. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Shall\nwe?&rdquo; She asked; her eyes never once leaving his. </p><p>Seokjin gently grabbed her hand and politely kissed\nit, &ldquo;We shall.&rdquo; </p><p>A roar of applause sounded throughout the large\nroom as Sumin and Seokjin left the comfortable confinements that was their\nlittle corner wall. Seokjin felt the envious gazes hitting his entire body; he\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but smirk proudly as he did. It was not every day where a lowly\nknight got to share the special dance with a princess. </p><p>After what it seemed like forever, walking through\nmany groups of people, Sumin and Seokjin took their position, right in the\ncenter of the dance floor. With their hands interlocked with one another, their\nbreathing grew heavy as the nerves slowly swallowed them whole. They would be\nthe second couple ever to execute such a special dance. Sumin&rsquo;s parents were\nthe first. </p><p>With patient hearts and jagged breathing, the\nanxious pair mentally counted down the beats before taking the first step.\nTheir eyes remained locked onto each other, neither one of them wavering their\nestablished contact. Their bodies moved as one as they danced inside the wall\nof people that surrounded them. A light gush of wind gently fanned their faces\nas Sumin and Seokjin continued to simply smile at each other, not saying a\nword. Their stares did all the talking for them. </p><p>They continued to dance as they became oblivious to\ntheir surroundings. The distinguishable faces became blurred as the bodies\ndisappeared one by one. Soon, it was just the two of them. The lavish golds and\nsilvers were the only guests in that ballroom now. One must not forget the tints\nof rose in the walls either. </p><p>Seokjin twirled Sumin, smiling warmly as his brown\neyes bored into hers. His hand never one unlocking with hers as he pulled her\nback. Her skirt raising slightly as Sumin&rsquo;s entire body spun around, creating a\nlight breeze. </p><p>A soft giggle left Sumin&rsquo;s innocent lips as she\nreturned to her rightful place&mdash; against Seokjin&rsquo;s body. Her right fingers\ninterlaced with his left as her left hand was placed firmly on his shoulder\nwhile his right hand was anchored on her waist. </p><p>Nothing but the look of complete adoration was\npresent in the two eyes as the song neared the end. As the final note\nproceeded, Seokjin dipped low as he mouthed, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, to her before\nlifting her up. </p><p>The sound of applause and cheers echoed throughout\nthe castle as Seokjin and Sumin bowed and curtsied to their audience. After\nacknowledging the last section of the crowd, Seokjin leaned down and whispered\nsomething enticing in Sumin&rsquo;s ear. She quickly masked her pleasing smile with\none of total professionalism. She then turned to Seokjin and slowly licked her\nlips before nodded eagerly yet subtly. She tightened her hold on his hand\nbefore politely excusing herself to her parents. Her parents saw a <i>certain </i>gleam in her eye and chuckled.\nThey knew that look in Seokjin and Sumin&rsquo;s eyes as they walked quickly out of\nthe ballroom. They were young once and boy did they rush off to their secret\nhiding places to&mdash; have a little bit of fun. </p><p>Not wanting to raise suspicions or a sense of\nworry, the king clapped his hands and demanded that the party continue. The\nquiet room was soon filled with lively music as the once frozen people finally\nleft their spots and filled the dance floor. Soon, happy chatter and polite\nchuckles floated into the air and mixed with the sounds of the orchestra. </p><p>On the other hand, in a different part of the\ncastle, a dimly lit room was filled with the sound of messy kisses and articles\nof clothing dropping to the floor. The skin-on-skin contact ignited a flame of\narousal within Sumin and Seokjin. The sense of urgency caused the two lovers to\nnot care about their outfits when they were practically ripping them off one\nanother. A tattered corset laid on the floor as Sumin&rsquo;s bare back was firmly pressed\nagainst the cold stone wall. Her hands were raised above her head as Seokjin&rsquo;s\nmouth was latched onto her beautiful breasts. </p><p>With one nipple in his mouth and the other being\nmassaged by his free hand, Seokjin twirled and pulled the nub in between his\nteeth. Hearing Sumin&rsquo;s precious moans only fueled his hormones and increased\nhis need to take her virginity. His need to possess Sumin in ways that only a\nlover could do. His need to remind her that she was his. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus&hellip;&rdquo;\nSumin moaned as her eyes rolled to the back of her head, taking in the pleasure\nthat she was receiving. She felt her core become soaked as she craved <i>something</i> to be inside of her. </p><p>Seokjin continued to assault her breasts as his\nfree hand soon left her chest and slowly trailed down her torso. His fingers\nlightly tickling down her naval before reaching the waist of her skirt. He then\ndecided to tease his princess just a bit, playing with the material as if he\nwas going to undo the ties and let it drop it down.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sir\nknight&hellip; please do not tease me&hellip;&rdquo; Sumin whined; her bundle of nerves throbbing\ndesperately. </p><p>Seokjin smirked against her stomach, having left\nher breasts minutes ago, &ldquo;Oh? Is the princess sounding needy? Maybe she needs\nto actually beg if she wants to be touched down there&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s eyes shot open as she lifted her head away\nfrom the wall. Her gaze locked onto Seokjin as she unknowingly constricted her\nwalls; the desire for something or <i>someone</i>\nto be inside of her grew stronger. Was she seriously thinking about giving up\nher pride as a princess and beg to be touched? Maybe just this once.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Please\nSeokjin. Please touch me&hellip;&rdquo; She paused as an airy moan flew out her lips. &ldquo;Make\nme feel something indescribable that has me a moaning mess.&rdquo; Sumin begged\nbefore licking her precious lips slowly, enticing him to take what he so\ndesperately craved. </p><p>Seokjin cocked up his brow, lips slightly ajar as\nhis breathing grew heavy. Hearing her begging, pleading for him to touch her\nturned on something in his handsome mind. Was this how a pair of intimate\nlovers behaved? Was this how they displayed true feelings of love with one\nanother? Whatever was bound to happen, he was happy that he was sharing this\nmoment with his precious Sumin. His everything. </p><p>With the sound of light pants and tiny whimpers,\nSumin mentally prepared herself what was about to happen. It was no secret that\nshe eavesdropped on the saucy gossip from her chamber maids and other castle\nworkers. She specially paid attention to the erotic tales that they happily\ngiggled over. Now, it was her moment to shine. It was time for to experience\nthe unspeakable flash of white that the maids spoke of numerous of times. It\nwas time for her feel this sudden wave of euphoria. It was time to become a\nwoman. </p><p>Steadying her racing her heart, Sumin bit her\nbottom lip as she felt his hands slowly trail up her bare thigh. The roughness\nfrom his fingers sent goosebumps on her arms as his fingers lightly danced on\nher skin. </p><p>A small whimper managed to escape her lips as Sumin\nfelt his fingers gradually close the gap. Before she knew it, Seokjin was\ntouching her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My\ngod&hellip;&rdquo; Seokjin cursed as his fingers were quickly coated with her juices. That\nwas how aroused she was. </p><p>His fingers continued to trace her folds, wanting\nto memorize every detail of her womanhood. He too started to bite his bottom\nlip as he tried to contain his raging hormones. He wanted to wait for their\nwedding night to take her virginity, however, that idea left his mind the\nmoment he encountered her soaking wet core. His index and middle fingers\naccidentally grazed her entrance as they were softly rubbing her pussy. Feeling\nher soaking wet entrance was enough reason for Seokjin to at least give her a\ntiny taste of what it was like to have something inside. He caressed her\nentrance once more before slowly inserting his index finger, careful to take\nnote of her discomfort. His pace started off slow, giving her some time to get\nused to his finger. As soon as her face contorted to a look of pleasure, he\ninserted his middle finger, stretching her virgin walls out. </p><p>Sumin rested her head back on the wall as her hand\nmagically found its way in his hear. She began to tug against the roots as he\npumped his index finger in and out. His thumb rubbed her bundle of nerves,\nsending jolt after jolt of pleasure throughout his princess.</p><p>Her lips were agape as the soft pants mixed with\nmoans fueled her desire to touch him. It was not fair that she was receiving\nthis insane amount of pleasure, and he wasn&rsquo;t getting anything in return. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My\nl-love&hellip;&rdquo; She whispered, though, it was difficult since he was still fingering\nher. </p><p>Seokjin continued to thrust his fingers, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; </p><p>A tiny whine left her lips. &ldquo;It is not fair that I\nam on the receiving end of our first intimate moment.&rdquo; Sumin placed her index\nfinger underneath his chin and gently tilted it up. &ldquo;Permit me to pleasure\nyou.&rdquo; She smiled alluring. </p><p>Seokjin felt his member twitch in excitement. Holy\nshit. That smile and the fact that she wanted to touch him was making it much\nharder on him to not throw her on the bed and take her now. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You\ndo not have to, Sumin. It is my duty to make sure that the princess is well\ntaken care.&rdquo; He teased; his fingers picking up the pace, earning himself a\ncouple of loud moans from her. </p><p>In that split second, hearing that deep tone in his\nvoice, sent an unspeakable chill down her spine. Sumin knew that she was\nvulnerable. She was a prey. She was simply putty in his fingers. </p><p>Back in the ballroom, Sumin&rsquo;s parents were in a\nheated discussion with King Ji Yong. They tried every excuse in the book to try\nand sway his mind, however, Ji Yong wasn&rsquo;t going to give up on <i>his</i> princess. Ji Yong was no fool. He\nknew of Sumin&rsquo;s kingdom&rsquo;s customs. He knew that that he had to prove himself\nworthy of her in order to be granted permission to wed her by her parents. The\nfun question was, how? How was he going to earn Sumin&rsquo;s favor when he knows\nsomething was going between her and her personal knight? Ji Yong especially\nobserved the knight&rsquo;s lip movement while they were dancing sweetly. He saw the\nlowly knight mouthed, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, to Sumin. Something about that irked him,\nbut he couldn&rsquo;t understand. At least not yet. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I\nhave made up my mind. I would like to stay in the castle and take the time to\nprove myself to the Princess Sumin.&rdquo; Ji Yong said, looking a tad disinterested.\n</p><p>The king and queen looked to one another, hoping\nthat either one of them would have another excuse on why that would be horrible.\nUnfortunately, they could not think of an excuse. That was one of the loopholes\nthat previous generations have yet to find a solution for. While the prince or\nprincess may have made up his or her mind on who he or she is marrying, another\nsuitor was free to still try and win over the affections of the prince or\nprincess. </p><p>With a heavy sigh, the king met the Ji Yong&rsquo;s gaze\nand courageously stared him down. No matter what, the happiness of his daughter\nis his top priority. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The\nqueen and I grant you permission to stay in one of our many guest suites during\nyour stay here. I do have to warn you though, that it might be quite difficult\nto win our daughter&rsquo;s affections as she is not like any other princesses\nthroughout the nation. She is headstrong, intelligent, and charismatic.&rdquo; The\nking said, trying one last time to turn Ji Yong off from Sumin. </p><p>A sly smile graced his handsome face as Ji Yong&rsquo;s\neyes sparked with someone unreadable. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;\n</p><p>Amidst the hard attempts of Sumin&rsquo;s parents trying\nto convince King Ji Yong to reconsider his marriage proposal, the young lovers\nwere busy filling the room with the sounds of heavy breathing, moaning, and\nloving whispers. </p><p>Seokjin upgraded from simply using his hands to\nusing his hands and his mouth. His tongue flicked and twirled around her\nsensitive nub while his fingers continued to thrust into her. Her sweet smell\nclouded his mind as his throbbing member ached to be in his fingers&rsquo; position.\nHis hardened length desperately wanting to be the one feeling her walls clench\naround it; her juices coating him continuously. </p><p>Whimper after whimper. Moan after moan. Pant after\npant. Those were the only sounds happening during their passionate rendezvous.<b></b></p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s breathing grew rapid as the pleasure built\nup in the pit of her stomach. Her walls began to constrict around his fingers\nas the desire for some form of a release drew closer and closer. This was not\nfair. She wanted to touch him and please him. However, before her mind could\nfocus more on that thought, a sudden sense of happiness rushed throughout her\nbody. Did she experience what the female castle workers called an &ldquo;orgasm&rdquo;?\nWell, whatever it was, she loved the feeling it gave her. She loved it even\nmore since it was Seokjin who gave her that high. </p><p>Now, with his fingers dripping from her precious\njuices, he decided to give himself a little bit of attention. Seeing her come\nundone like that caused his member to harden even more. It was practically\npressing against the fabric of his trousers. That was how aroused he was. Plus,\nit didn&rsquo;t help that her <i>smell</i> was\nstill flooding his senses. Every time he took a breath, her sweet aroma came\ncrashing in, sending his hormones into a crazed frenzy. </p><p>His hand quickly undid the belt and then reached\ninside. His aching member twitched even more at the sudden warm contact. With\nher juices coating his fingers, he slowly rubbed his shaft, mixing his pre-cum\nwith her cum. </p><p>Before he could speed up his pace, he felt a\nfamiliar hand on top of his. His lips were captured as well. </p><p>Once she came down her high and regained her\nsenses, her vision locked onto Seokjin. Her eyes trailed down as she noticed\nhis hand moving up and down at a rapid pace.</p><p>Wanting to return the favor, Sumin crawled up to\nhim and placed her dainty hand on top of his. She then captured his beautiful\nlips before he could protest. </p><p>Swallowing his moans, Sumin focused on pleasuring\nthe man in front of him. She wanted him to feel the same high as she felt. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh\nmy&hellip; at this rate, you are going to make me release&hellip;&rdquo; Seokjin moaned as his head\nflew back. His eyes rolled to the back of his head as well. </p><p>Sumin smirked as she hovered her lips over his ear,\n&ldquo;Good. I want you to feel good my lord.&rdquo; </p><p>With one simple phrase, Seokjin released. Tiny\nstrips of white shot out, painting Sumin&rsquo;s hand as she her rubbing slowed down.\n</p><p>A goofy grin graced Seokjin&rsquo;s handsome face as he\ncame down his euphoric high. He tucked his soft member back inside his trousers\nbefore standing up and finding a cloth to clean up Sumin. </p><p>After searching for a good couple of minutes,\nSeokjin managed to find a white handkerchief and walked back to his princess.\nHe handed the cloth to her as he pressed his lips sweetly against her temple. </p><p>Sumin muttered a quick thank you before wiping off\nany traces of intimacy from her hand. Once her hands were clean, Sumin stared\nat her tattered corset as she wondered how on Earth was she going to explain to\nher mother and father that her undergarment was no longer presence. </p><p>Seokjin noticed Sumin&rsquo;s brow furrow; a habit she\ndid whenever she thought long and hard about something, &ldquo;What is the matter, my\nlove?&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin gestured to her corset, &ldquo;How am I going to\nexplain to my parents that my corset is destroyed?&rdquo;</p><p>Seokjin chuckled, &ldquo;Well, would it ease your mind\nthat I asked your nurse to prepare a second dress for you?&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin raised her brow, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>The joyous celebration continued into the early\nhours into next day. No one showed signs of wanting to leave the birthday\nparty. After all, it is not every day one gets to witness a princess become a\nwoman. </p><p>A mixture of loud instruments filled the ballroom\nas the princess finished her rounds of dancing with every eligible suitor that\nattended her party. Unfortunately, her mind was still preoccupied on the events\nthat took place before she walked back into the ballroom&mdash; wearing an entirely\ndifferent dress. </p><p>Lucky for her, no one seemed to mind or cared\nenough to say something to her. However, would anyone want to accuse the\nprincess of something while he or she was in <i>her</i> kingdom? Probably not. </p><p>Graciously moving across the dancefloor, Sumin\nsmiled politely and maintained eye contact with the princes she was currently\ndancing with. With dark raven colored locks, and his dark brown eyes piercing\ninto hers, she continued to make tiny conversations with the annoying prince.\nJungkook, she believed to be his name. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Am\nI boring you princess? You do not seem too keen on my talk of my many\nachievements.&rdquo; Sumin heard the arrogant prince say. </p><p>She quickly mustered a sincere smile, &ldquo;Oh, forgive\nmy lord, I was just getting hypnotized by your smile.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing her compliment boosted his pride. Maybe he\nwas going to have the honor of marrying the princess. Unlike his fellow\nprinces, who were currently eyeing him with pure envy. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh?\nHas the princess fallen for my charms?&rdquo; Jungkook inquired, displaying a smile\nthat would make any other princess swoon. </p><p>Sumin fought the urge to gag, &ldquo;Of course. What kind\nof princess do you take me for?&rdquo; </p><p>Jungkook cocked up his brow, thinking, &ldquo;A strong\nmind&hellip; I like it.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of them continued to dance all across the\nballroom, earning themselves a wave of compliments. The many onlookers smiled\nand admired how Sumin and Jungkook looked together. Something in their combined\naura that made the idea of a union between them favorable, especially with\nJungkook&rsquo;s parents. </p><p>As the song played the last notes, Sumin politely\ncurtsied to Jungkook while Jungkook returned the favor by bowing to her. Before\nparting ways, Jungkook gently took her hand and placed a chaste kiss on her\nknuckles. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Goodnight,\nprincess.&rdquo; He winked at her before walking over to his parents.</p><p>Sumin maintained her diplomatic smile until he was\nfar enough away for her to drop it. She let out a small groan before graciously\nwalking over to Seokjin. </p><p>Seokjin smirked and looked down on his princess,\nstill having their little steamy meeting embedded in his mind. He secretly\nkissed her soft cheek as he asked her how her little love dance with Prince\nJungkook went. </p><p>Sumin rolled her eyes, &ldquo;Oh, it was magical. Now, I\nam going to my mother and father that it is Prince Jungkook I want to marry and\nhave many children with.&rdquo;</p><p>Seokjin chuckled deeply, &ldquo;Do not be like, my\nprincess. I was simply teasing.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as Sumin was about to retaliate, she heard her\nfather give the announcement that the party celebration was officially over.\nShe then, out of the corner of her eye, noticed him gesturing to her and\nSeokjin. </p><p>The two lovers looked to one another; their brows\nknitted together. Her father&rsquo;s current expression was unsettling. Something\nhorrific was about to happen, but what. </p><p>Now settled in her father&rsquo;s office chambers, Sumin,\nwho was resting her head against Seokjin&rsquo;s shoulder, eyed her parents with pure\nconcern. Her heart raced as her stomach did somersaults while patiently\nawaiting the news from her father. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My\nlovely daughter&hellip; you know that your mother and I want nothing but the best for\nyou, especially when it comes to choosing your future husband.&rdquo; Her father\nbegan, trying to find the right words to say next. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What\nis happening, papa?&rdquo; Sumin interrupted as she gripped her hold on Seokjin&rsquo;s\nhand, feeling afraid that something or <i>someone</i>\nwas going to tear them apart. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do\nyou remember meeting King Kwon Ji Yong at the party tonight?&rdquo; Her father asked.\n</p><p>Both Seokjin and Sumin nodded.</p><p>The king exhaled deeply before baring the terrible\nnews.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He\nhas taken it upon himself to invite himself to stay in the castle as our guest\nas he has expressed deep desire to make you his wife.&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin gasped, suddenly losing all oxygen in her\nlungs. She quickly latched onto the pendant that Seokjin gifted her on her\nfifteenth birthday with a look of complete dread etched on her face.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;How\nlong does King Ji Yong plan to stay with us?&rdquo; Sumin asked softly as Seokjin\nuttered nothing but loving words in her ear, hoping to ease her worries. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;However\nlong it will take for you to agree to be his wife.&rdquo; Her other responded,\nfeeling her own break for her daughter. </p><p>Sumin frowned as she buried her face in Seokjin&rsquo;s\nchest, hating the idea of marrying someone else that was not her knight.</p><p>Seokjin, on the other hand, was fuming on the\ninside. He was not happy whatsoever with some random king marrying his\nprincess. They were childhood friends. They were blooming lovers. They had <i>history</i>. No one could ever come close to\nSumin for him. She was it. Now? He knew that he must do something and quick. He\nand Sumin had talked about waiting a few more years and was only granted that\nrequest earlier in the day. This was all wrong. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My\nmajesties, may I request that the princess and I relinquish our wish to wed in\na few years&rsquo; time?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;May\nI ask why?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I\nwant to marry the princess Sumin as soon as possible.&rdquo; </p><hr /><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Well how do you like this chapter now?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn? </small></p>\n<p><small>\n\n&#8251; <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a>&nbsp;<br /></small></p>\n<p><small>\n\n&#8251; <b>Next Time:</b>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><i>Chapter 2: Time is of the Essence </i></h2>\n</p>",
