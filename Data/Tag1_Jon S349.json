She&rsquo;s determined to show everyone that a woman can solve a complicated crime like this. But everything changes when she discovers that the infamous Jack the Ripper, serial killer, maniac, psychopath, is the man she loves.</small></p><p><small>*I shameless stole some inspiration from the wonderful Kerri Maniscalco*</small></p><p><small>Triggers: I don&rsquo;t go into much detail when it comes to the killing part.

Tonight she was gonna end this fear, for once and for all. </p><p>Jack the Ripper, or whoever he might be, would not kill another woman. Jack the Ripper would not take any other organs that weren\u2019t his to take. Jack the Ripper would be stopped by a girl barely old enough to marry. </p><p>She tied up her hair and put on her black jacket. She had cracked the code a few days ago. She knew where he would be tonight. She knew how to find him. And then she would bring him to the police, proving once and for all that girls were just as good at solving crimes as boys were. </p><p>Her father would be proud of her. Her big brother would be proud of her. Jon would be proud of her and maybe finally ask for her hand in marriage. Bran and Rickon would be proud of her and Arya would have someone to look up to, someone proving her that she could be whoever she wanted to be.</p><p>Sansa walked down the stairs on the tips of her toes to make sure to not wake up the entire house. She carefully opened the door and she made sure to not slam it shut behind her. Her carriage was waiting for her around the corner, paid in cash a couple of hours ago when she had told everyone she was out to buy a new dress. </p><p>The driver already knew where they were going. He simple nodded when Sansa arrived and stepped in, forcing the horses to start moving before she had properly seated herself.</p><p>Her heart was racing in her chest. Deep dow she knew that she should have asked someone to come with her, that she should have asked for back up. But she knew how that would end. </p><p>Her back up would steal all the glory. Her back up would be praised by the newspapers. Her back up would be the hero she intended to become.</p><p>She was not gonna let a man steal her glory. She was not gonna let a man take credits for her intelligence. She was not gonna make this about anyone but herself. </p><!-- more --><p>The carriage came to a stop twenty minutes later in a dark ally, hidden from plain sight. The neighborhood was not the kind of neighborhood anyone visited at this unholy time. There were more shadows, both moving and standing still, than there was light. Even the full moon couldn\u2019t brighten the area. This was the domain of hookers, of drugs dealers, of alcoholics and gamblers. This was the domain of serial killers. This was the domain of Jack the Ripper. </p><p>Sansa took a deep breath, but regretted it almost instantly. The strange odeur triggered her nostrils and she could barely fight the sneeze that would draw way too much attention to a rich girl who was totally out of place. </p><p>Totally out of place, maybe, but on a mission. </p><p>She stared at the clock, peeking over the buildings like a guard standing watch. She was five minutes too early. She was right in time to let her eyes wander over the figures occupying these streets. </p><p>One of them was the murderer she was after. It could be the man with the long coat and the hat, leaning heavily on a stick while smoking a cigarette that was for sure not just a cigarette. It could be the man pretending to be asleep on the ground, looking like he hadn\u2019t washed himself in ages, with hair that almost reached his knees. It could be the owner of the laugh echoing all around them, the owner of the voice luring people into a strange establishment that would ruin whatever was left of their reputation. </p><p>Sansa felt a shiver rolling down her spine. Her bravery, her confidence, it was slowly fading away. So far Jack the Ripper had always targeted women he believed no one would miss, but still she didn\u2019t feel completely safe yet. </p><p>What if the only reason he had killed hookers so far, was that there had been no one better around? What if instead of catching him, he would catch her first? What if her name would make the headlines in tomorrow\u2019s newspapers, but in a totally different way?</p><p>She pressed her back to the wall and took a few deep breaths. She had one more minute. One more minute to recognize the killer and to stop him. One more minute to either save her own life or someone else\u2019s. One more minute to\u2026</p><p>A strange movement in the corner of her eyes caught her attention. It was nothing but a shadow, but it was swift and smooth, it moved like it knew what it was doing.</p><p>Sansa started running. She started running towards the shadow instead of away from it, but when she was about to make her heroic move she froze. </p><p>The dark black curls, the frown on his forehead, his lips forming a straight line. It looked familiar. Way too familiar, but out of place combined with the bloodied knife in his hands and the darkness hiding most of his face. </p><p>A part of her brain registered that she was too late. That whoever she had wanted to rescue was already dead, killed by one smooth movement of a sharp knife, cowardly attacked from behind without even the slightest chance of escaping her fate. </p><p>But that part of her brain was overruled by any other part of her mind, her soul and her body. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Her voice was nothing but a whisper, breakable, vulnerable. She wasn\u2019t sure if she should scream or cry or shout or yell or fight. She was not sure if her eyes could be trusted, but her heart told her they were not lying. </p><p>Jon looked up. He had his fingers curled around the knife. His eyes were filled with determination, but the moment he saw her, the moment he recognized her, the determination started to fade, replaced by panic, by fear and maybe even shame. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He hissed between his teeth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be in this part of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be either\u2026\u201d Sansa spoke softly. Even if she would want to talk louder, she wouldn\u2019t be able to do so. &ldquo;You shouldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d She stuttered. She tried to comprehend what she was seeing, but somehow she couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d How could she ever say this out loud?</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s not what you think, Sansa!\u201d Jon stood up and he dropped the bloodied knife. \u201cI can explain, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d Sansa stepped back. One step. Two steps. Three steps. Until her back hit the wall and she had nowhere else to go. \u201cThe entire town is looking for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Jon stepped closer and he scratched the back of his neck. A moment before he had looked so different from the Jon she had known, from the Jon she had fallen in love with. Right now her Jon had returned, but it was too late to erase the images imprinted on her mind. \u201cI know.\u201d Jon bent his head and stared at his feet. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sansa eventually managed to say. She knew she should call for help. She should call for someone. But she couldn\u2019t. Not yet. Not before she knew why he had done it. Why he had killed all those women, why he had taken their organs, why he had become a serial killer, the biggest fear this city had ever known. \u201cWhy?\u201d She asked again. Her voice was still trembling and she tensed all her muscles. </p><p>\u201cI wanted\u2026\u201d Jon swallowed. Tears rolled down his cheeks. \u201cI wanted to bring back my mom\u2026\u201d He fell down on his knees in the mud, in the dirt, in whatever covered the cobbles in this part of London. \u201cI just need\u2026\u201d He shook his head and he buried his face in his hands. \u201cJust the heart. Then I can\u2026I can\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo what, Jon?\u201d Sansa kneeled down in front of him and she grabbed his chin and forced him to look up, to look at her. </p><p>\u201cI can bring her back. I can do it. Just like Frankenstein.\u201d Jon widened his eyes as if he all of a sudden realized what he had done. \u201cI\u2026I only took women no one would miss to bring back a woman everyone loved.\u201d </p><p>Sansa let out a deep sigh. She wanted to hate him. She wanted to yell at him. She wanted to tell him that he deserved to be in jail. She wanted to see him as a monster, as the monster he had been towards the media, towards all the women who didn\u2019t dare to leave their houses anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s just a book, Jon. It\u2019s not real.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cYou can have all the organs in the world and it still wouldn\u2019t bring her back and even\u2026\u201d Sansa paused for a few seconds. \u201cEven if somehow you can bring her body back to life, it won\u2019t be her, it won\u2019t contain her soul.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Jon leaned towards her, his chin resting on her shoulder. \u201cBut I had to try\u2026I just had to\u2026I\u2026.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and held onto Sansa as tightly as he could. \u201cI miss her so\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa closed her eyes and then she embraced him, rocking him back and forth in her arms. \u201cI know, Jon. We all do\u2026\u201d She kissed his cheek, his hair, his forehead. \u201cBut what do we do with you now?\u201d </p><p>Jon kept silent. His tears dripped on her shoulder. Once in a while he sniffed. \u201cI deserve to die for this.\u201d Jon eventually said, his voice steady, as if he had already given up, as if he had already accepted that this was where this all would end, sooner or later. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Sansa shook her head and her hands rubbed his back. \u201cYou&rsquo;re hurt and broken. You\u2019re damaged and in pain.\u201d She pulled back and she stroke his hair from his face. \u201cBut you\u2019re not a monster or a murderer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am, Sansa.\u201d Jon replied and nodded. Slime and salted tears covered his chin and neck. \u201cI am a monster. I am a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one knows\u2026\u201d Sansa couldn\u2019t believe her own words, couldn\u2019t believe what she was saying. When she had left her house half an hour ago she had been determined to find Jack, to kill him, to take all the credits for catching him. Now she just wanted to save him. She wanted to save him from himself. \u201cNo one knows but you and me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026\u201d Jon breathed in and forgot to breath out. \u201cHow can you ever forgive me?\u201d He swallowed. \u201cHow can you still look at me and tell me you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you still love you?\u201d Sansa straightened her back. She would have to explain tomorrow how her dress had gotten this dirty. \u201cCan you live with what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Jon bent his head again, his forehead touching her nose. \u201cI think I wanted someone to catch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Sansa replied.</p><p>\u201cI wanted someone to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Sansa replied again. </p><p>From the very beginning the letters had been meant for her and only her. The letters to the newspapers hadn\u2019t been for the police. They hadn\u2019t been for the public eye. They had been a scream for help. And they had worked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted someone to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Sansa embraced him again. \u201cI will save you. I will heal you. I will love you. And no one, no one needs to know that it was you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey will never stop looking for Jack\u2026\u201d Jon spoke about him as if it was another person, someone he didn\u2019t know, someone he hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>\u201cBut they will never find him.\u201d She spoke firm and leaned back, her glance meeting his for a short moment. \u201cThey will never find him.\u201d She nodded at him and Jon nodded back. \u201cMy beautiful, broken, man\u2026\u201d Sansa sighed and then she leaned in to kiss his lips. Maybe it wasn\u2019t appropriate, but after everything that had happened she couldn\u2019t really worry about it. </p><p>\u201cMy strong, brave, lady\u2026\u201d Jon kissed her back.</p><p>It was only when her lips were red and swollen that she realized they had to leave. They had to leave right now and leave Jack the Ripper where he belonged. In the past. </p><p>\u201cLet&rsquo;s go home. It\u2019s time for you to officially ask my father for my hand in marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he says no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will marry you anyway. You need me, Jon Snow.\u201d Sansa stood up and reached out her hands to help Jon standing up too. \u201cAnd I want you. And nothing else matters.\u201d</p>",

The neighborhood was not the kind of neighborhood anyone visited at this unholy time. There were more shadows, both moving and standing still, than there was light. Even the full moon couldn\u2019t brighten the area. This was the domain of hookers, of drugs dealers, of alcoholics and gamblers. This was the domain of serial killers. This was the domain of Jack the Ripper. </p><p>Sansa took a deep breath, but regretted it almost instantly. The strange odeur triggered her nostrils and she could barely fight the sneeze that would draw way too much attention to a rich girl who was totally out of place. </p><p>Totally out of place, maybe, but on a mission. </p><p>She stared at the clock, peeking over the buildings like a guard standing watch. She was five minutes too early. She was right in time to let her eyes wander over the figures occupying these streets. </p><p>One of them was the murderer she was after.

The neighborhood was not the kind of neighborhood anyone visited at this unholy time. There were more shadows, both moving and standing still, than there was light. Even the full moon couldn\u2019t brighten the area. This was the domain of hookers, of drugs dealers, of alcoholics and gamblers. This was the domain of serial killers. This was the domain of Jack the Ripper. </p><p>Sansa took a deep breath, but regretted it almost instantly. The strange odeur triggered her nostrils and she could barely fight the sneeze that would draw way too much attention to a rich girl who was totally out of place. </p><p>Totally out of place, maybe, but on a mission. </p><p>She stared at the clock, peeking over the buildings like a guard standing watch. She was five minutes too early. She was right in time to let her eyes wander over the figures occupying these streets. </p><p>One of them was the murderer she was after. It could be the man with the long coat and the hat, leaning heavily on a stick while smoking a cigarette that was for sure not just a cigarette. It could be the man pretending to be asleep on the ground, looking like he hadn\u2019t washed himself in ages, with hair that almost reached his knees. It could be the owner of the laugh echoing all around them, the owner of the voice luring people into a strange establishment that would ruin whatever was left of their reputation. </p><p>Sansa felt a shiver rolling down her spine. Her bravery, her confidence, it was slowly fading away. So far Jack the Ripper had always targeted women he believed no one would miss, but still she didn\u2019t feel completely safe yet. </p><p>What if the only reason he had killed hookers so far, was that there had been no one better around? What if instead of catching him, he would catch her first? What if her name would make the headlines in tomorrow\u2019s newspapers, but in a totally different way?</p><p>She pressed her back to the wall and took a few deep breaths. She had one more minute. One more minute to recognize the killer and to stop him. One more minute to either save her own life or someone else\u2019s. One more minute to\u2026</p><p>A strange movement in the corner of her eyes caught her attention. It was nothing but a shadow, but it was swift and smooth, it moved like it knew what it was doing.</p><p>Sansa started running. She started running towards the shadow instead of away from it, but when she was about to make her heroic move she froze. </p><p>The dark black curls, the frown on his forehead, his lips forming a straight line. It looked familiar. Way too familiar, but out of place combined with the bloodied knife in his hands and the darkness hiding most of his face. </p><p>A part of her brain registered that she was too late. That whoever she had wanted to rescue was already dead, killed by one smooth movement of a sharp knife, cowardly attacked from behind without even the slightest chance of escaping her fate. </p><p>But that part of her brain was overruled by any other part of her mind, her soul and her body. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Her voice was nothing but a whisper, breakable, vulnerable. She wasn\u2019t sure if she should scream or cry or shout or yell or fight. She was not sure if her eyes could be trusted, but her heart told her they were not lying. </p><p>Jon looked up. He had his fingers curled around the knife. His eyes were filled with determination, but the moment he saw her, the moment he recognized her, the determination started to fade, replaced by panic, by fear and maybe even shame. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He hissed between his teeth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be in this part of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be either\u2026\u201d Sansa spoke softly. Even if she would want to talk louder, she wouldn\u2019t be able to do so. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d She stuttered. She tried to comprehend what she was seeing, but somehow she couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d How could she ever say this out loud?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, Sansa!\u201d Jon stood up and he dropped the bloodied knife. \u201cI can explain, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d Sansa stepped back. One step. Two steps. Three steps. Until her back hit the wall and she had nowhere else to go. \u201cThe entire town is looking for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Jon stepped closer and he scratched the back of his neck. A moment before he had looked so different from the Jon she had known, from the Jon she had fallen in love with. Right now her Jon had returned, but it was too late to erase the images imprinted on her mind. \u201cI know.\u201d Jon bent his head and stared at his feet. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sansa eventually managed to say. She knew she should call for help. She should call for someone. But she couldn\u2019t. Not yet. Not before she knew why he had done it. Why he had killed all those women, why he had taken their organs, why he had become a serial killer, the biggest fear this city had ever known. \u201cWhy?\u201d She asked again. Her voice was still trembling and she tensed all her muscles. </p><p>\u201cI wanted\u2026\u201d Jon swallowed. Tears rolled down his cheeks. \u201cI wanted to bring back my mom\u2026\u201d He fell down on his knees in the mud, in the dirt, in whatever covered the cobbles in this part of London. \u201cI just need\u2026\u201d He shook his head and he buried his face in his hands. \u201cJust the heart. Then I can\u2026I can\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo what, Jon?\u201d Sansa kneeled down in front of him and she grabbed his chin and forced him to look up, to look at her. </p><p>\u201cI can bring her back. I can do it. Just like Frankenstein.\u201d Jon widened his eyes as if he all of a sudden realized what he had done. \u201cI\u2026I only took women no one would miss to bring back a woman everyone loved.\u201d </p><p>Sansa let out a deep sigh. She wanted to hate him. She wanted to yell at him. She wanted to tell him that he deserved to be in jail. She wanted to see him as a monster, as the monster he had been towards the media, towards all the women who didn\u2019t dare to leave their houses anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s just a book, Jon. It\u2019s not real.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cYou can have all the organs in the world and it still wouldn\u2019t bring her back and even\u2026\u201d Sansa paused for a few seconds. \u201cEven if somehow you can bring her body back to life, it won\u2019t be her, it won\u2019t contain her soul.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Jon leaned towards her, his chin resting on her shoulder. \u201cBut I had to try\u2026I just had to\u2026I\u2026.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her and held onto Sansa as tightly as he could. \u201cI miss her so\u2026\u201d</p><p>Sansa closed her eyes and then she embraced him, rocking him back and forth in her arms. \u201cI know, Jon. We all do\u2026\u201d She kissed his cheek, his hair, his forehead. \u201cBut what do we do with you now?\u201d </p><p>Jon kept silent. His tears dripped on her shoulder. Once in a while he sniffed. \u201cI deserve to die for this.\u201d Jon eventually said, his voice steady, as if he had already given up, as if he had already accepted that this was where this all would end, sooner or later. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Sansa shook her head and her hands rubbed his back. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt and broken. You\u2019re damaged and in pain.\u201d She pulled back and she stroke his hair from his face. \u201cBut you\u2019re not a monster or a murderer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am, Sansa.\u201d Jon replied and nodded. Slime and salted tears covered his chin and neck. \u201cI am a monster. I am a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one knows\u2026\u201d Sansa couldn\u2019t believe her own words, couldn\u2019t believe what she was saying. When she had left her house half an hour ago she had been determined to find Jack, to kill him, to take all the credits for catching him. Now she just wanted to save him. She wanted to save him from himself. \u201cNo one knows but you and me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026\u201d Jon breathed in and forgot to breath out. \u201cHow can you ever forgive me?\u201d He swallowed. \u201cHow can you still look at me and tell me you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you still love you?\u201d Sansa straightened her back. She would have to explain tomorrow how her dress had gotten this dirty. \u201cCan you live with what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Jon bent his head again, his forehead touching her nose. \u201cI think I wanted someone to catch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Sansa replied.</p><p>\u201cI wanted someone to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Sansa replied again. </p><p>From the very beginning the letters had been meant for her and only her. The letters to the newspapers hadn\u2019t been for the police. They hadn\u2019t been for the public eye. They had been a scream for help. And they had worked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted someone to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Sansa embraced him again. \u201cI will save you. I will heal you. I will love you. And no one, no one needs to know that it was you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey will never stop looking for Jack\u2026\u201d Jon spoke about him as if it was another person, someone he didn\u2019t know, someone he hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>\u201cBut they will never find him.\u201d She spoke firm and leaned back, her glance meeting his for a short moment. \u201cThey will never find him.\u201d She nodded at him and Jon nodded back. \u201cMy beautiful, broken, man\u2026\u201d Sansa sighed and then she leaned in to kiss his lips. Maybe it wasn\u2019t appropriate, but after everything that had happened she couldn\u2019t really worry about it. </p><p>\u201cMy strong, brave, lady\u2026\u201d Jon kissed her back.</p><p>It was only when her lips were red and swollen that she realized they had to leave.

Until her back hit the wall and she had nowhere else to go. &ldquo;The entire town is looking for you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; Jon stepped closer and he scratched the back of his neck. A moment before he had looked so different from the Jon she had known, from the Jon she had fallen in love with. Right now her Jon had returned, but it was too late to erase the images imprinted on her mind. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Jon bent his head and stared at his feet. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Sansa eventually managed to say. She knew she should call for help. She should call for someone. But she couldn&rsquo;t. Not yet. Not before she knew why he had done it. Why he had killed all those women, why he had taken their organs, why he had become a serial killer, the biggest fear this city had ever known. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She asked again. Her voice was still trembling and she tensed all her muscles. </p><p>&ldquo;I wanted&hellip;&rdquo; Jon swallowed. Tears rolled down his cheeks. &ldquo;I wanted to bring back my mom&hellip;&rdquo; He fell down on his knees in the mud, in the dirt, in whatever covered the cobbles in this part of London. &ldquo;I just need&hellip;&rdquo; He shook his head and he buried his face in his hands. &ldquo;Just the heart. Then I can&hellip;I can&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do what, Jon?&rdquo; Sansa kneeled down in front of him and she grabbed his chin and forced him to look up, to look at her. </p><p>&ldquo;I can bring her back. I can do it. Just like Frankenstein.&rdquo; Jon widened his eyes as if he all of a sudden realized what he had done. &ldquo;I&hellip;I only took women no one would miss to bring back a woman everyone loved.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa let out a deep sigh. She wanted to hate him. She wanted to yell at him. She wanted to tell him that he deserved to be in jail. She wanted to see him as a monster, as the monster he had been towards the media, towards all the women who didn&rsquo;t dare to leave their houses anymore. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a book, Jon. It&rsquo;s not real.&rdquo; Sansa shook her head. &ldquo;You can have all the organs in the world and it still wouldn&rsquo;t bring her back and even&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa paused for a few seconds. &ldquo;Even if somehow you can bring her body back to life, it won&rsquo;t be her, it won&rsquo;t contain her soul.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo; Jon leaned towards her, his chin resting on her shoulder. &ldquo;But I had to try&hellip;I just had to&hellip;I&hellip;.&rdquo; He wrapped his arms around her and held onto Sansa as tightly as he could. &ldquo;I miss her so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa closed her eyes and then she embraced him, rocking him back and forth in her arms. &ldquo;I know, Jon. We all do&hellip;&rdquo; She kissed his cheek, his hair, his forehead. &ldquo;But what do we do with you now?&rdquo; </p><p>Jon kept silent. His tears dripped on her shoulder. Once in a while he sniffed. &ldquo;I deserve to die for this.&rdquo; Jon eventually said, his voice steady, as if he had already given up, as if he had already accepted that this was where this all would end, sooner or later. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa shook her head and her hands rubbed his back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt and broken. You&rsquo;re damaged and in pain.&rdquo; She pulled back and she stroke his hair from his face. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not a monster or a murderer.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I am, Sansa.&rdquo; Jon replied and nodded. Slime and salted tears covered his chin and neck. &ldquo;I am a monster. I am a murderer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But no one knows&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa couldn&rsquo;t believe her own words, couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was saying. When she had left her house half an hour ago she had been determined to find Jack, to kill him, to take all the credits for catching him. Now she just wanted to save him. She wanted to save him from himself. &ldquo;No one knows but you and me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you&hellip;&rdquo; Jon breathed in and forgot to breath out. &ldquo;How can you ever forgive me?&rdquo; He swallowed. &ldquo;How can you still look at me and tell me you love me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you still love you?&rdquo; Sansa straightened her back. She would have to explain tomorrow how her dress had gotten this dirty. &ldquo;Can you live with what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Jon bent his head again, his forehead touching her nose. &ldquo;I think I wanted someone to catch me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo; Sansa replied.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted someone to stop me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo; Sansa replied again. </p><p>From the very beginning the letters had been meant for her and only her. The letters to the newspapers hadn&rsquo;t been for the police. They hadn&rsquo;t been for the public eye. They had been a scream for help. And they had worked.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted someone to save me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Sansa embraced him again. &ldquo;I will save you. I will heal you. I will love you. And no one, no one needs to know that it was you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They will never stop looking for Jack&hellip;&rdquo; Jon spoke about him as if it was another person, someone he didn&rsquo;t know, someone he hadn&rsquo;t been.</p><p>&ldquo;But they will never find him.&rdquo; She spoke firm and leaned back, her glance meeting his for a short moment. &ldquo;They will never find him.&rdquo; She nodded at him and Jon nodded back. &ldquo;My beautiful, broken, man&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa sighed and then she leaned in to kiss his lips. Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t appropriate, but after everything that had happened she couldn&rsquo;t really worry about it. </p><p>&ldquo;My strong, brave, lady&hellip;&rdquo; Jon kissed her back.</p><p>It was only when her lips were red and swollen that she realized they had to leave. They had to leave right now and leave Jack the Ripper where he belonged. In the past. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home. It&rsquo;s time for you to officially ask my father for my hand in marriage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if he says no?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will marry you anyway. You need me, Jon Snow.&rdquo; Sansa stood up and reached out her hands to help Jon standing up too. &ldquo;And I want you. And nothing else matters.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Tonight she was gonna end this fear, for once and for all. </p>\n<p>Jack the Ripper, or whoever he might be, would not kill another woman. Jack the Ripper would not take any other organs that weren&rsquo;t his to take. Jack the Ripper would be stopped by a girl barely old enough to marry. </p>\n<p>She tied up her hair and put on her black jacket. She had cracked the code a few days ago. She knew where he would be tonight. She knew how to find him. And then she would bring him to the police, proving once and for all that girls were just as good at solving crimes as boys were. </p>\n<p>Her father would be proud of her. Her big brother would be proud of her. Jon would be proud of her and maybe finally ask for her hand in marriage. Bran and Rickon would be proud of her and Arya would have someone to look up to, someone proving her that she could be whoever she wanted to be.</p>\n<p>Sansa walked down the stairs on the tips of her toes to make sure to not wake up the entire house. She carefully opened the door and she made sure to not slam it shut behind her. Her carriage was waiting for her around the corner, paid in cash a couple of hours ago when she had told everyone she was out to buy a new dress. </p>\n<p>The driver already knew where they were going. He simple nodded when Sansa arrived and stepped in, forcing the horses to start moving before she had properly seated herself.</p>\n<p>Her heart was racing in her chest. Deep dow she knew that she should have asked someone to come with her, that she should have asked for back up. But she knew how that would end. </p>\n<p>Her back up would steal all the glory. Her back up would be praised by the newspapers. Her back up would be the hero she intended to become.</p>\n<p>She was not gonna let a man steal her glory. She was not gonna let a man take credits for her intelligence. She was not gonna make this about anyone but herself. </p>\n</p>",

(amicably, but satin is still very much romantically interested in jon which has led to a couple of awkward situations.)<br />5. very protective of arya and can often be found commiserating with her whenever catelyn says something ignorant or dismissive about nb identities.<br />6. general excellent caretaker figure of all their trans friends and the designated driver whenever they all go out to the queer club night at the local student bar.</li><li><b>YGRITTE:</b><br />1. nonbinary; uses she/her pronouns.<br />2. does not like makeup but nevertheless allows jon to do hers whenever they go to places like pride, because let&rsquo;s be honest, jon knows how to do an amazing sharp-enough-to-kill-a-man winged eyeliner and that one time they gave her rainbow glittery lips for pride is still one of her favourite photos of herself<br />3. was captain of the archery team at school (went to the same school as sansa, margaery and arya, only on a sports scholarship) and it was the time that she outshot every other person on the field during a national competition that jon realised they were in love with this person and needed to meet them immediately<br />4. rejected jon at least four times before they finally got together. jon likes to say it was their charming personality and winning smile that won her over; ygritte will tell you she was bored and wanted a fuck buddy, and it just went from there</li></ul><p>P.S. more loras headcanons can be found here (<a href=\"http://translorastyrell.tumblr.com/post/163499230062/i-have-a-lot-of-thoughts-about-trans-loras-also\">x</a>)</p>",
