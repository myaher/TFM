The first time I saw Taylor in concert was the opening night of the Reputation tour. I always wanted to go before, but could never afford tickets! May 8, 2018 was the best night of my life! Maybe one day Taylor will notice me :)\nYou should also check out my Instagram, also @SwiftieJordan (the link is down below). I'm extremely active there and also follow back all my fellow swifties.",

        "body": "<p>Dear Taylor,\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>It just hit me hard right now that I\u2019m so enternally grateful that somehow that universe lived up in a way that let me spend the most magical night with you in London. Somehow of all the tours I got to attend the reputation tour. Although I of course have loved all the other eras, and would have loved to attended the earlier tours, something about this strikes a cord with me. I don\u2019t talk about it a lot but I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of a lot of hate and bullying over a condition I had as a child which I had no control over. I worked really hard for years and years to get over that condition. And although it all happened when I was younger the stain on my reputation is still there. People still say this and that about me. When I first heard New Romantics during the 1989 era I got so emotional because the line \u201cI could build a castle out of all the bricks the threw at me\u201d was the perfect way to express what I had gone through. I had gotten so much shit thrown my way, but I had fought on and held my head high. I still remember sitting in school blasting that song in my headphones. I was so empowering to know that the person I looked up to the most knew exactly what I was feeling. Flash forward a few years and there had been quite a load of drama in the group of friends I was part of. A person I had invited back into my life turned her back on me again, even after me sitting on the phone with her for half and hour crying and begging for her to tell me what was wrong so we could fix it. I was diagnosed with an illness that put me being out of balance, physically and mentally. I am still working on recovery and trying to get somewhat back to normal. In the midst of all this you released Reputation. Not only did it brighten my days. It provided me with lyrics that I could relate to both recent and past events. It was a whole album of that empowered me in the same way New Romantics did. I realized that no matter the bad things that had happened I still had my real friends who did care about the \u201cHe said, she said.\u201d and who stayed when it was hard or wrong or when I made mistakes. I realized that even if I have a long way to go still, I\u2019ll eventually get back to feeling normal even with my diagnosis, and that one day all my broken bones will be mending. Getting to see you Taylor, and getting to thank you by dancing and singing my heart out, was so special. I would have loved to give you a standing ovation that lasted even longer than those three minutes at London night one. My heart aches over what you had to go trough, but I\u2019m overjoyed that you are doing better than you ever were.

Somehow of all the tours I got to attend the reputation tour. Although I of course have loved all the other eras, and would have loved to attended the earlier tours, something about this strikes a cord with me. I don\u2019t talk about it a lot but I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of a lot of hate and bullying over a condition I had as a child which I had no control over. I worked really hard for years and years to get over that condition. And although it all happened when I was younger the stain on my reputation is still there. People still say this and that about me. When I first heard New Romantics during the 1989 era I got so emotional because the line \u201cI could build a castle out of all the bricks the threw at me\u201d was the perfect way to express what I had gone through. I had gotten so much shit thrown my way, but I had fought on and held my head high. I still remember sitting in school blasting that song in my headphones. I was so empowering to know that the person I looked up to the most knew exactly what I was feeling. Flash forward a few years and there had been quite a load of drama in the group of friends I was part of. A person I had invited back into my life turned her back on me again, even after me sitting on the phone with her for half and hour crying and begging for her to tell me what was wrong so we could fix it. I was diagnosed with an illness that put me being out of balance, physically and mentally. I am still working on recovery and trying to get somewhat back to normal. In the midst of all this you released Reputation. Not only did it brighten my days. It provided me with lyrics that I could relate to both recent and past events. It was a whole album of that empowered me in the same way New Romantics did. I realized that no matter the bad things that had happened I still had my real friends who did care about the \u201cHe said, she said.\u201d and who stayed when it was hard or wrong or when I made mistakes. I realized that even if I have a long way to go still, I\u2019ll eventually get back to feeling normal even with my diagnosis, and that one day all my broken bones will be mending. Getting to see you Taylor, and getting to thank you by dancing and singing my heart out, was so special.

Whilst this is a big deal on its own it\u2019s an especially big deal for me as my first year of study was the worst year of my adult life. I unfortunately met someone who mentally abused me, isolated me and destroyed my confidence so I was a shell of the person I used to be. </p>\n\n<p>THANKFULLY I made incredible friends who stuck by me, supported me and guided me through a time when I couldn\u2019t even trust my own decisions. I had family who always had my best interests at heart and patiently waited for me to return back to the happy, confident person I once was. And very, very importantly I had you to guide me through those really difficult times with your music. It\u2019s hard to explain what someone you have never met has done for your life and growth but it\u2019s very true. Your music offered me moments of respite in my hours of despair and one day after months of dysfunction and denial that he really wasn\u2019t all THAT bad, Dear John came on shuffle and I suddenly thought <br/>\n\u201cIf it really isn\u2019t that bad&hellip;why does this song tick every box of my relationship?\u201d <br/>\nIt took me longer than I would have liked but I ended that relationship, closed that chapter of my life and moved on to not only the person I used to be, but someone better. Stronger. Wiser. </p>\n\n<p>This all ends happily with my graduating from university with a degree, amazing memories and many lessons learnt. My dissertation (of which I wrote about you Taylor!) was the most challenging academic part of my university experience and was what lead me to get a 2:1, an achievement I never thought i was capable of. </p>\n\n<p>So thank you SO much, Taylor. Everything you\u2019ve ever done for me without even realising. I\u2019m doing better than I ever was. </p>\n\n<p>Love, <br/>\nBecca</p>",
