In the last few seasons Sansa has basically gotten a blank check to do whatever she wants and, no matter how many times she puts her own desires before her own family, no matter who she manipulates or how unjustified her behavious is, the writers don\u2019t really make her deal with the consequences of her actions. She just keeps going, not changing at all because she has no motivation to change.</p><p>Jon shouldn\u2019t have said she was right after she hid the army of the Vale before the BotB, the Vale lords should have demanded some actual proof of LF\u2019s betrayals before they allowed him to be executed, someone should have told her how stupid it is to openly dismiss Daenerys when she comes to help. Missandei deserved a medal for pointing out that Dany and her armies were the only reason her precious North had a chance against the army of the dead.</p><p>\n\nJon should find out Sansa betrayed his secret the very same day he told her and this time he should not forgive her. Sansa used his parentage to hurt the woman he loves right after she saved the North. After Sansa swore she would never tell anyone. Arya should find out and be as pissed as she was in season 7 when she thought Sansa would betray Jon, because that\u2019s what she has done. Sadly Bran doesn\u2019t have any\u00a0 reactions anymore, but if he were still Bran and not the 3ER he would be upset with Sansa too.<br/></p><p>She should lose the respect of the northen lords and the northeners for being an oathbreaker, for using Jon as pawn. She should lose the power she loves so much.\u00a0</p><p>But honestly I don\u2019t think the show will go there. I think she will get one of the best endings, regardless of her actions.</p>",

        "body": "<p>There are three Game of Thrones Prophecies</p><p>1. The Prince that was Promised</p><p>Melisandre spoke the words of this prophecy:\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Long Night is coming. Only the Prince Who Was Promised can bring the dawn. The Prince is destined to \u201clead the people against a darkness\u201d with a flaming sword called Lightbringer. \u201cThere will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world,\u201d and\u00a0\u201cin this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Many think that Arya Stark fits this Prophecy, but I don\u2019t think so. Arya Stark has her own purpose which is shutting Brown Eyes, Blue Eyes and Green Eyes. Plus when she killed the Night King it was a dagger and not a sword. Also the dagger wasn\u2019t on fire.\u00a0</p><p>I think the Prince may either be Jaime Lannister or Jon Snow. Jaime Lannister is known as a king slayer and is technically a prince. I know he only has one hand but it could be him considering the next prophecy works with this one.\u00a0</p><p>2. Valonqar</p><p>Cersei Lannister was told this prophecy long ago on Season 5:\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou will never wed the prince, you will wed the king.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll be queen, for a time. Then comes another \u2014 younger, more beautiful \u2014 to cast you down and take all you hold dear\u2026The king will have 20 children, and you will have three\u2026Gold will be their crowns, gold their shrouds. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>So far most of this prophecy has been fulfilled. Cersei was promised to Jon\u2019s Dad but married Robert Baratheon. She did have three children but with her brother. Robert did have many bastard sons. The prophecy does not state that they would have children together but separately.Her three children all did die awful deaths in the show. Cersei has been Queen for sometime now and there is someone currently more beautiful that is planning on taking the throne herself aka Daenerys, but it could be Sansa. Sansa does want to take everything away from her just like Cersei took almost everything from Sansa. The last part of the prophecy states that one of her \u2018brothers\u201d will kill her. I think it will be Jaime that will help Arya kill his sister and not Tyrion. Tywin Lannister told Tyrion that he is not his son. Meaning that Tyrion could very well be a Targaryen for all we know. Tyrions mother was well liked by the Mad King himself. Which brings me to the next prophecy.\u00a0</p><p>3. Three Heads of the Dragon</p><p>Rhaegar Targaryen has said that\u00a0\u201cThe Dragon has three heads.\u201d Meaning that there must be three dragon riders or Three Targaryens.</p><p>So we all now know that Jon Snow is Aegon Targaryen. Daenerys is a Targaryen. Now we need another one. This brings me back to the time that Tywin Lannister told Tyrion that he is not his son. The Mad King did\u00a0\u2018fancy\u2019 Tyrion\u2019s mother and maybe he is the child of the two. Which might be the reason that the dragons didn\u2019t burn him to ash. Tyrion has said from the beginning that as a little boy he dreamt of dragons. I believe that he is a Targaryen. He is loyal to Jon and Daeneyrs. Which means that Tyrion would be Daeneyrs half brother and Uncle to Jon. Which could be part of the prophecy that states about the Dragon having three heads. Three Heads of House Targaryen. I firmly believe this. Jon is the rightful heir, Daenerys wants the throne, and Tyrion is Daenerys Hand. Three Dragons ruling the throne.\u00a0</p><p>What if Jon is the Prince that was Promised, Daenerys is the beautiful Queen that will de-throne Cersei, Jaime assisting Arya killing Cersei and Tyrion being the third dragon? At this point in the final season of Game of Thrones anything is possible. Plus I believe that if anyone would know about who Tyrions father is, it would be our three eyed raven, Bran Stark.\u00a0</p>",

She has been killed but is now an Undead. She looks like a living person thanks to a charm made by Sansa but her true appearance is the one of a corpse and she is mute due to her throat being slit. Catelyn cannot die again unless she is burnt or decapitated and thus is not afraid to put herself in danger for her family. Since she is a descendant of powerful witches, she is the reason her children and herself have powers.</p><h2>Robb Stark \u2013 The War Spirit</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a842e9a8bdaca047390383e096b576/tumblr_pr7klvL1Cv1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Robb Stark is the first son of Ned and Catelyn. After his father&rsquo;s murder, he becomes mad with grief and fury. He gets lost in the Northern Woods where he is found by War Spirits who make him one of their own to allow him to get his revenge. He is the most prone to violence in the family and can lash out easily. He is also over protective of his family. As a War Spirit, Robb can summon a full armour, a horse and a sword to slay his enemies.</p><h2>Sansa Stark \u2013 The Witch</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/853c6a0327fd7f69ae8971809107d87f/tumblr_pr7kloc3qN1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Sansa Stark is the second child of Ned and Catelyn. After her father&rsquo;s death, her witch powers awaken. She is easily one of the most powerful members of the Stark and is behind Catelyn&rsquo;s charm and Bran&rsquo;s survival after he is attacked. She is the first to see her father&rsquo;s ghost. Sansa&rsquo;s powers includes the creation of charms, telekinesis and the creation of illusions. Blood and bones can make her magic stronger but she refuses to use them and she uses runes and crystals as vessels.</p><h2>Arya Stark \u2013 The Vampire</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a9adbc5832d5a10e3fd4549c36e5cf1/tumblr_pr7klxtRjj1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>After her father&rsquo;s death, Arya Stark runs away from home and is found by Jaqen, a vampire who attacks her. She survives thanks to Robb&rsquo;s intervention and her witch heritage and becomes a vampire. Stronger and faster than human, she is prone to mood swings for a while because of bloodlust but leans to control it. She wants to avenge her father and protect her family more than anything. Arya&rsquo;s closest sibling was Jon and she is heartbroken when he joins the Order.</p><h2>Bran Stark \u2013 The Druid</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fca2fbb9fa4cf11b5b3ac422faa781f0/tumblr_pr7klt9MIZ1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Bran Stark is the fourth child of Catelyn and Ned. His Druid powers allow him to control animals and to have visions. His powers awoke after his father&rsquo;s death, just like Sansa&rsquo;s, and they grew closer after. He is attacked by Jaime Lannister a few months later and is crippled as a result. This attack was the official beginning of the war between the Lannisters and the Starks.</p><h2>Rickon Stark \u2013 The Werewolf</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d1873841822be132c031e57c9657c0/tumblr_pr7klmDO9L1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Last child of Ned and Catelyn, Rickon is a young boy who is turned into a werewolf after being attacked in the woods. He was following Robb, worried for his brother. His wolf form is huge and black, and is uncontrollable because it is the incarnation of Rickon&rsquo;s pain and suffering.</p><h2>Theon Greyjoy \u2013 The Kraken</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8d4a8238548f45852debd2e7412de3a/tumblr_pr7klrtm0O1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Theon Greyjoy was placed in the Stark&rsquo;s care when he was nine after his father was arrested for child abuse. Theon resented Ned for a while throughout his childhood because he was the judge who condemned his father and he is hesitant in joining the war. However, Jon&rsquo;s betrayal makes him realize that he truly cares for the Starks and saves Rickon on his own. He is a water spirit, just like all the other member of his family and can manipulate water.</p><h2>Jon Snow \u2013 The Hunter</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f3e7c46ebed0114835f24d953c92741/tumblr_pr7kljOxZh1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Jon Snow is Ned Stark&rsquo;s nephew who has been adopted by Ned and Catelyn after his birth due to his mother&rsquo;s death. He distanced himself from his brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; after learning about his true parentage. After Ned&rsquo;s death and the Starks becoming supernatural beings due to Catelyn&rsquo;s heritage, he feels even more like an outcast. After one of Arya&rsquo;s violent mood swings, the sibling of whom he was the closest, he becomes terrified and joins the Order, an organisation hunting supernatural beings, hoping to \u201ccure\u201d his family.</p>",

She has been killed but is now an Undead. She looks like a living person thanks to a charm made by Sansa but her true appearance is the one of a corpse and she is mute due to her throat being slit. Catelyn cannot die again unless she is burnt or decapitated and thus is not afraid to put herself in danger for her family. Since she is a descendant of powerful witches, she is the reason her children and herself have powers.</p><h2>Robb Stark \u2013 The War Spirit</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a842e9a8bdaca047390383e096b576/tumblr_pr7klvL1Cv1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Robb Stark is the first son of Ned and Catelyn. After his father\u2019s murder, he becomes mad with grief and fury. He gets lost in the Northern Woods where he is found by War Spirits who make him one of their own to allow him to get his revenge. He is the most prone to violence in the family and can lash out easily. He is also over protective of his family. As a War Spirit, Robb can summon a full armour, a horse and a sword to slay his enemies.</p><h2>Sansa Stark \u2013 The Witch</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/853c6a0327fd7f69ae8971809107d87f/tumblr_pr7kloc3qN1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Sansa Stark is the second child of Ned and Catelyn. After her father\u2019s death, her witch powers awaken. She is easily one of the most powerful members of the Stark and is behind Catelyn\u2019s charm and Bran\u2019s survival after he is attacked. She is the first to see her father\u2019s ghost. Sansa\u2019s powers includes the creation of charms, telekinesis and the creation of illusions. Blood and bones can make her magic stronger but she refuses to use them and she uses runes and crystals as vessels.</p><h2>Arya Stark \u2013 The Vampire</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a9adbc5832d5a10e3fd4549c36e5cf1/tumblr_pr7klxtRjj1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>After her father\u2019s death, Arya Stark runs away from home and is found by Jaqen, a vampire who attacks her. She survives thanks to Robb\u2019s intervention and her witch heritage and becomes a vampire. Stronger and faster than human, she is prone to mood swings for a while because of bloodlust but leans to control it. She wants to avenge her father and protect her family more than anything. Arya\u2019s closest sibling was Jon and she is heartbroken when he joins the Order.</p><h2>Bran Stark \u2013 The Druid</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fca2fbb9fa4cf11b5b3ac422faa781f0/tumblr_pr7klt9MIZ1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Bran Stark is the fourth child of Catelyn and Ned. His Druid powers allow him to control animals and to have visions. His powers awoke after his father\u2019s death, just like Sansa\u2019s, and they grew closer after. He is attacked by Jaime Lannister a few months later and is crippled as a result. This attack was the official beginning of the war between the Lannisters and the Starks.</p><h2>Rickon Stark \u2013 The Werewolf</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d1873841822be132c031e57c9657c0/tumblr_pr7klmDO9L1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Last child of Ned and Catelyn, Rickon is a young boy who is turned into a werewolf after being attacked in the woods. He was following Robb, worried for his brother. His wolf form is huge and black, and is uncontrollable because it is the incarnation of Rickon\u2019s pain and suffering.</p><h2>Theon Greyjoy \u2013 The Kraken</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8d4a8238548f45852debd2e7412de3a/tumblr_pr7klrtm0O1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Theon Greyjoy was placed in the Stark\u2019s care when he was nine after his father was arrested for child abuse. Theon resented Ned for a while throughout his childhood because he was the judge who condemned his father and he is hesitant in joining the war. However, Jon\u2019s betrayal makes him realize that he truly cares for the Starks and saves Rickon on his own. He is a water spirit, just like all the other member of his family and can manipulate water.</p><h2>Jon Snow \u2013 The Hunter</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f3e7c46ebed0114835f24d953c92741/tumblr_pr7kljOxZh1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Jon Snow is Ned Stark\u2019s nephew who has been adopted by Ned and Catelyn after his birth due to his mother\u2019s death. He distanced himself from his brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 after learning about his true parentage. After Ned\u2019s death and the Starks becoming supernatural beings due to Catelyn\u2019s heritage, he feels even more like an outcast. After one of Arya\u2019s violent mood swings, the sibling of whom he was the closest, he becomes terrified and joins the Order, an organisation hunting supernatural beings, hoping to \u201ccure\u201d his family.</p></p>",
