Granted, these people were a small minority, but&hellip;.yikes.</p><p>AM hasn\u2019t experienced anything like that (as far as I know) but the fandom is certainly nothing like it was back in S1 (back when it was actually a friendom). There\u2019s definitely a increase in freaking out and drama over stuff. And&hellip;..don\u2019t @ me, I think Josh is a cool kid, but I think him being so involved in the fandom, particularly in the way he\u2019s so messy with it a lot of the time, sometimes exacerbates issues the tag already has. Mainly when people start acting like whatever he posts is the end all be all. </p><p>So tldr: GMW tag had more serious issues, but it was a specific, small minority of users, and AM tag is more broadly annoying </p><p>(but there\u2019s positive aspects to both fandoms! I only talked about the negatives because that\u2019s what the anon was asking about)</p>",
