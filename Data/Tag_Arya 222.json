                "content": "<p>November 20 &ndash; day 3 (foreshadowing\nand parallels)</p><p>The day before she goes blind, Arya\nslices the throat of a Night&rsquo;s Watch deserter in Braavos, throw his body in the\nwater and keep his boots. </p><p>That&rsquo;s both echoing what happened\nto her mother at the Twins (her throat was sliced and her body dumped in the\nriver) and what Jon does to Janos Slynt in ADWD: Slynt lose his head for refusing\nan order and Jon allows Owen the Oaf to help himself to Slynt&rsquo;s boots. Arya\nkills Dareon for disobeying her brother&rsquo;s orders, but we&rsquo;re also told that Cat\nof the Canals used to walk around the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbor &ldquo;<b>in a pair of battered boots too big for her feet</b>&rdquo; (Cat of the\nCanals &ndash; AFFC).</p><p>In her first ADWD chapter, Daenerys\nis offered a pair of slippers that are too small for her:</p><p><b>&ldquo;Cleon\nthe Great sends these slippers as a token of his love for Daenerys Stormborn,\nthe Mother of Dragons.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b> Irri slid the slippers onto Dany&rsquo;s feet. They\nwere gilded leather, decorated with green freshwater pearls. <i>Does the butcher king believe a pair of\npretty slippers will win my hand?</i> &ldquo;King Cleon is most generous. You\nmay thank him for his lovely gift.&rdquo; Lovely, but made for a child. Dany had\nsmall feet, yet the pointed slippers mashed her toes together</b>. &ndash; Dany, ADWD</p><p>So&hellip; parallels? We&rsquo;ll dig a bit\nfurther:</p><p><b>At\nthe end of the day she would often sit on a rock and dangle her feet in the\ncool water. She had finally thrown away her cracked and rotted shoes. Walking\nbarefoot was hard at first, but the blisters had finally broken, the cuts had\nhealed, and her soles had turned to leather. The mud was nice between her toes,\nand she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she walked.</b> &ndash; Arya, ACOK</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>The\nrocks had scraped her hands raw. They are better than they were, though, she\ndecided as she picked at a broken blister. Her skin was pink and tender, and a\npale milky fluid was leaking from her cracked palms, but her burns were healing.</b></p><p><b>The\nsun was hot this morning, the sky blue and cloudless. That was good. Dany&rsquo;s\nclothes were hardly more than rags, and offered little in the way of warmth.\nOne of her sandals had slipped off during her wild flight from Meereen and she\nhad left the other up by Drogon&rsquo;s cave, preferring to go barefoot rather than\nhalf-shod</b>. &ndash;\nDaenerys, ADWD</p><p>Both girls are lost in nature, with\nbroken blisters and healing injuries (cuts and burns) and both decide to go\nbarefoot, Arya because her shoes were &ldquo;cracked and rotted&rdquo;, Dany for having\nlost one. However, whereas Arya&rsquo;s soles &ldquo;had turned to leather&rdquo;, Dany&rsquo;s feet\nblisters again:</p><p><b>She\nwas very tired, and fresh blisters had appeared on both her feet, including a\nmatched set upon her pinky toes</b>.\n&ndash; Daenerys, ADWD</p><p>I tend to think that Arya&rsquo;s feet\nwere &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; by the fact that she was walking North, while Dany&rsquo;s feet bled\nfrom her attempt at returning to Meereen. </p><p>The new skin beneath the blisters\nis a symbol of rebirth: Arya and Dany have &ldquo;thrown away&rdquo; and &ldquo;scraped&rdquo; their\nold skins, either because it was too old and &ldquo;rotted&rdquo; (in Arya&rsquo;s case), or\nbecause it didn&rsquo;t fit right (in Dany&rsquo;s case). Arya&rsquo;s feet successfully take\nroots, while Dany&rsquo;s new path rejects her. Their bare feet might also have something\nto do with a reconnection with their spirit animals (and Dany loose one of her\nsandals in mid-air, which is also symbolic). </p><p>Cat&rsquo;s boots are too big (probably\npointing to how &ldquo;lost&rdquo; Arya feels in AFFC) and Dany&rsquo;s slippers are too small\n(probably pointing to how &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; Dany feels in ADWD). Cat remains Cat\nthrough most of the chapter, until she kills Dareon and admit to the kindly man\nthat it was &ldquo;Arya of House Stark&rdquo; who did it &ndash; perhaps because the act\nreconnects her with her mother and her brother Jon, and gets her a pair of\nboots that fit right. </p><p>Jon is another matter altogether: after\nkilling Slynt, he gives the boots to someone else.</p><p><b>Janos\nSlynt twisted his neck around to stare up at him. &ldquo;Please, my lord. Mercy.\nI&rsquo;ll &hellip; I&rsquo;ll go, I will, I &hellip;&rdquo;</b></p><p><b><i>No</i></b><b>,\nthought Jon. <i>You closed that door</i>.\nLongclaw descended. &ldquo;Can I have his boots?&rdquo; asked Owen the Oaf, as\nJanos Slynt&rsquo;s head went rolling across the muddy ground. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost\nnew, those boots. Lined with fur.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b> Jon glanced back at Stannis. For an instant\ntheir eyes met. Then the king nodded and went back inside his tower</b>. &ndash; Jon, ADWD</p><p>Side note: the &ldquo;Tales of Peter\nRabbit&rdquo; by Beatrix Potter was translated in French under the title &ldquo;le conte de\nJeannot Lapin&rdquo;. Isn&rsquo;t it funny that Jon took Janos&rsquo;s head, and Dany her &ldquo;rabbit\nears&rdquo;, in the same book? But I digress. We know that Janos lost to Jon in the\nLC elections, and we know that Janos&rsquo;s plans for the Night&rsquo;s Watch, should he\nhave been elected, were nowhere near Jon&rsquo;s. Jon, obviously, has no interesting\nin wearing Janos&rsquo;s boots. Owen the Oaf takes the boots and Jon takes the head. </p><p>The irony is that, had Jon worn\nJanos&rsquo;s &ldquo;boots&rdquo;, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been killed. But then, he wouldn&rsquo;t\nbe Jon. The boots likely wouldn&rsquo;t fit him. </p><p>In any case, in asoiaf, the shoes\nyou wear and don&rsquo;t wear might reveal some things about who you are &ndash; and who\nyou&rsquo;re not. </p>",
