        "body": "<p>The two bodyguards slide the intricate gold doors open for you and you flash them a sultry smile as your heels sink into the soft Turkish rugs. The smell of cigarettes and cash greets you as you make your way to the exchange section to get my thousand dollars worth of chips. After the drowsy clerk hands me the stack I walk over to the poker table to oil my rusty tricks. Grabbing a drink from a server I down it in one shot and take an empty seat. You look at your fellow competitors and take them in as you count their cards and their facial expressions. You look at the mid forty year old man who has seen one too many beers with his shirt barely keeping his stomach in. The man on your left who probably has taken crack since he hit puberty, and the guy at the end of the table to the right looks pleasing to the eyes. He has thick brown hair, that makes you want to run your fingers through. His hazel eyes meet yours and the three o\u2019clock shadow makes your toes curl as he smirks. He was going to be your main competition. You lower the neckline of your dress and stick your chest out, sweeping your hair over to your left side to give him a good view. The man shifts in his seat and you know that he\u2019s hooked. He taps the table and the dealer hands him another card. From the clenched jaw you knew he went over and he turns his cards face up.<br/></p><p>You look at yours and decide to play the chance of fate. The dealer keeps his eyes on you and you know he was going to be troublesome when you started to win too much. Not wanting to cause a scene so early into the night, you take your small win of $3000 and head to a another table closer to the back, up not as risky. Keeping a blank face you count your cards and easily make a ten thousand dollar bet into a twenty thousand win. Being the ever damsel in distress you aimlessly make your way to the tables in the back where the big spenders usually are. You put on a confused expression and Stumble into a roped off area.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d You look up at the bouncer as he steadies you.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d You ask rather loudly and slur words at the end.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am you\u2019re not permitted to be here.\u201d The scary looking bouncer says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the entrance fee?\u201d You bat your eyelashes as you take your chips out from your clutch.</p><p>\u201cThe starting bid is ten thousand.\u201d The other bouncer says in a monotone voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I can spare a few then?\u201d You give the one in the right a sweet smile and walk past him like a piece of discarded trash.</p><p>You take a seat at a poker table and rest your eyes on the dealer. From the leering smirk, he gives you, you know to puff your chest up a little too high and see his hands don\u2019t falter at all. Well then, I guess we\u2019ll have to do this the hard way.</p><p>Just as you make your first million, you quickly walk out of the room and past the two bodyguards. Taking your phone out you text Yoongi to get the car ready before you have to spill some innocent blood. As you walk past tables, you quick cash in your money and walk out of the building with ten million in cash. The red Ferrari swings by and you slide in as the door slide back into place. Yoongi speeds away and you laugh as you flip through the stacks of hundred dollar bills.</p><p>Yoongi quickly glances at you and asks, \u201cHow much did you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell after growing tired of counting cards, I decided to call in a few favors, as in there\u2019s going to be some bodies for the police to sort through. Don\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t kill them just wrenched them of consciousness. I think I stole my first few millions and then changed that into double digits with pure hard work.\u201d You drone as if you didn\u2019t feel the blood sliding down from your daggers.</p><p>\u201cHow many did you kill?\u201d He deadpans as if he\u2019s asked you this before.</p><p>\u201cOnly one,\u201d you mumble.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he says in a warning tone as you can practically hear the engine screaming as he revs the accelerator.</p><p>\u201cOkay it was five, but they were all bad guys and they deserved it. They killed an entire family and raped five girls. So one guy for every girl raped.\u201d You defend.</p><p>He sighs and looks at you with your hands up.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, how much did you get?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201c10.5 million,\u201d he smirks as if he thinks that he\u2019ll win.</p><p>You laugh and after a few seconds you catch your breath and confess, \u201cI stole ten million, but made twenty million by gambling. The tables were in my favor and a few dealers were in me?\u201d You smirk.</p><p>\u201cWell someone was busy.\u201d He mutters.</p><p>\u201cAw, are you jealous that you couldn\u2019t get laid?\u201d He reaches to grab one of his hands.</p><p>He quickly let\u2019s go and grasps your hand. You rest your head back and lean into his shoulder as your body takes in everything that happens.</p><p>The night reels back in your mind and you remember coming for that sexy three o clock shadow you met at the poker club. Realizing that killing takes a lot of energy you wake up and turn your head to Yoongi and see him ordering some burgers at a drive-through. You smile at him, the smell of oil and fries wakes your brain up and you look out the window and realize that you\u2019re near your apartment.</p><p>After Yoongi pays for the food you open the bag and pull out the burger with fries. After you devour your burger in a few bites and finishing your fries, washing it down with some sprite you look at Yoongi who is snacking on his fries.</p><p>\u201cSo where do you want to go for our next date?\u201d He asks as you sip your drink.</p><p>\u201cHm, what\u2019s the most expensive restaurant in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Crouz, it\u2019s French,\u201d he says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cHow about BBQ?\u201d</p><p>You perk at the thought of fresh meat and the smoky smell of grills with music blasting out in the dark atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cSure. Nothing spontaneous and pricy?\u201d He raises his brows to his platinum blonde hair.</p><p>\u201cWell I like meat and want to eat meat on Friday because I\u2019ll probably be underground, so why not get some meat at the end for a reward?\u201d You mutter the part about the fighting underground so he won\u2019t suspect anything.</p><p>\u201cYou fight?\u201d He asks curiously.</p><p>\u201cWell more like sparr, I just do it to keep up with new techniques and make sure that I can defend myself should some of my enemies choose to get revenge.\u201d You try to brush off, but his hand tilts your chin upwards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d He confesses as it that\u2019s the key to unlock you.</p><p>You divert your eyes and he tugs your gaze back gently. He waits patiently and you sigh as he let\u2019s go.</p><p>\u201cI have years worth of enemies, I have killed countless people and don\u2019t plan to stop, I steal, hack, and do other sorts of illegal things. But I don&rsquo;t whore myself or do drugs. I\u2019m not sure about this mainly because you might get hurt. By either myself or my enemies.\u201d You say quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve killed too, I also fight and know what it\u2019s like to be in that dark place I -,\u201d</p><p>You shake your head and lean back into the seat resting your head on the headrest.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you smile at the dark and see that it is welcoming after some time. You like being by yourself and not having to worry about people. Me, myself, and I. I don\u2019t need to care about others feelings.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grabs your hand and you turn to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI know, the dark smiles back at you doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>You nod your head slowly and close your eyes as a tear slides them down. The pain of your past taking over your mind. The blood that will always stain your hands. As if being a surgeon who fixes hearts can wash away the blood. Every time you scrub into an O.R. you hope that it\u2019ll get a bit of the old blood that you can never wash off slowly.</p><p>He brushes the tear away with a thumb and you give him a small smile as you thank him for the night and head to your apartment.</p><p>As the door swings open you kick your shoes off at the door and head to the shower to clean the blood that has been drying on your thighs. As you close the bathroom door I slide the two daggers out from the garter and turn on the cold water, letting the water wash away the blood. After their visibly clean you turn on the shower and warm up the water. You quickly wash the smell of cigarettes and alcohol away. After walking out hair wrapped in a towel along with your torso you swipe the blades off the counter and pick up your dress from the floor. You close your bedroom door and wrap the daggers in a piece of old silk as you hide them under your underwears. I take the stacks out of my rather large clutch as if he knew that I was going to win big, I lift one of the floorboards and store it with the rest. I look at the stack of colorful currency, American dollars, Korean won, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The occasional pound and euro have their own place. Sighing I throw the dress into my hamper and fall on the bed, your phone buzzes and you crawl around until your hand finds the cool metal.</p><p>Yoongi: Same time next week?</p><p>Alex: Yep</p><p>Yoongi: I can\u2019t sleep</p><p>Alex: I can so night</p><p>Yoongi: Wow, how heartless are you</p><p>Alex: I used to kill people for a living so I have no heart.</p><p>Yoongi: Well some people need their beauty rest more than others, so night. ;P</p><p>Alex: Night orge.</p><p>I smile at my hilarious comeback and turn off my phone before darkness hit me.</p><p>I wake up to the smell of sausage and bacon, wondering why I\u2019m smelling such delicious food. I roll out of bed and realize that I\u2019m naked as I probably rolled out of the towel at some point in my slumber. I slip on my slipper and grab a silk robe off the back of the door as I walk out into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve been yelling at you to wake up and with some oil and meat, you come rolling in in less than a minute.\u201d Tae comments from the sizzling skillet.</p><p>\u201cWell, this gives me something in return besides your presence.\u201d I draw as you take sausages from the plate.</p><p>I continue munching on the sausage links as Taehyung finishes cooking the rest of the bacon. While he cooks I pour myself some cereal since I don\u2019t really like bacon, it\u2019s too oily for my taste.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to know?\u201d I look up at him as I slurp my cereal.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stay in his car for so long when he parked in the garage for so long,\u201d he says in a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cWere you two making out during that time?\u201d He asks after you slurp more of your cereal.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know we were in the garage?\u201d I raise a brow at him.</p><p>\u201cI rigged the cameras to notify me when his car drove by, I was in the middle of watching a horror movie and all of a sudden sirens went off and scared the shit out of me,\u201d he complains.</p><p>I laugh and eat another sausage link before explaining.</p><p>\u201cWell, in fact, we did have quite the time,\u201d I wiggle my eyebrows, but continue on. \u201cWe did more than just have sex,\u201d Tae\u2019s eyes widen and you smirk. \u201cWe had an emotional conversation revealing our darkest secrets and I confessed about having blood on my hands. He also kills people and we sparked a connection of some sort, like the broken hearts club. I also said that I banged like five guys and killed five guys and he wasn\u2019t scared at all. We\u2019re going on another date next Friday and this time it\u2019s BBQ so I can wear my eating pants.\u201d You finish.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t bang and kill five guys?\u201d he clarifies as if that was the main point of my explanation.</p><p>\u201cWell I didn\u2019t bang five guys, just made out with them and then I killed my five targets, but other than that it was interesting since it\u2019s been a while. I forgot what it was like playing with things at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they deserve it?\u201d he asks in a blank voice, no judgment evident in him.</p><p>I give him a simple nod and he nods back.</p><p>\u201cWant to go to the library to write that essay that\u2019s due on Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure let me put on my nice sweats and then we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice sweats?\u201d he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, the ones that don\u2019t make me look like a trash bag.\u201d I shoot back.</p><p>Quickly changing into an oversized sweatshirt that you stole from Tae back in high school and changing into a pair of sweats with pockets, of course, I make grab my backpack and head out with Tae.</p><p>\u201cWhen you start dating Yoongi will we still be allowed to do this?\u201d \u00a0Tae looks down at you as you notice his arm around your shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNope because from the way Yoongi acts he already knows that he has me hooked and I have him too so I can spend all day in nothing but my sweats and a sports bra and he wouldn\u2019t care. Well maybe he would be there to bang me since I would look hot, but that was all.\u201d As if Yoongi was spying on us somehow the security camera in the elevator seemed to blink.</p><p>\u201cI swear to god Yoongi know the boundaries before I show you the hard way,\u201d I smile sweetly at the camera before discreetly get an eye booger out of from the corner of my eye with my middle finger. Getting the clue, the camera turns on and off again as if nodding.</p><p>You both laugh at how scared Yoongi got.</p><p>\u201cYou really have him whipped with just one date.\u201d Taehyung smirks.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you shrug as you slide into his car and it makes sense now, why you were drawn to him in first grade. He was always too curious for his own good.</p><p>14 years ago\u2026..</p><p>\tMrs. Adams just never followed my requests, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. After asking to use the bathroom I went into the principal&rsquo;s office and unlocked her computer with an easy overriding code that you learned from Sehun. I broke into her computer and changed my grade from Mrs. Adam\u2019s class from a C to an A. I quickly closed all the programs and signed out of the editing account I used. As you look for the logout button you see from under the desktop that a pair of dark brown eyes was watching you. I ignore the boy and hopped off the chair and smiled as he darted away. I ran after him and caught him by the back of his blazer.</p><p>I dragged Taehyung to a nearby corner and placed him in front of you.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you watching me huh?\u201d I needed to instill fear in him so that he would be too scared to tell on me.</p><p>\u201cI was j-just seeing why you snuck into the principal&rsquo;s office since that\u2019s against the rules,\u201d he states with his wide eyes.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at how he was such a goody-goody.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell on me and I won\u2019t hurt you, yeah?\u201d I pushed harder into his shoulders.</p><p>He slowly nodded his head.</p><p>The next day when you ate in the library you felt the same pair of eyes on you as you read a human anatomy book.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you eat with Jimin?\u201d I asked without looking up from my book.</p><p>\u201cI realized that I never saw you in the cafeteria and followed you here,\u201d he said quietly as he walked over to your empty table.</p><p>I tried to hide my wince as I flipped a page and his curious eyes didn\u2019t let it go unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d his voice filled with worry.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just wince at seeing all the big words,\u201d I tried to brush off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re hurt, but where?\u201d he scooted closer to inspect you and bit the inside of your cheek to keep out from wincing in pain.</p><p>Even though it was just a bruise, it still hurt to sit and bend my torso. I felt his eyes the minute you entered school this morning and the worried looks he kept on casting at me during class was starting to make the teachers become suspicious. When lunch came I made my way to the library so his questions wouldn\u2019t be heard by other people.</p><p>I sighed and decided to put on a show, \u201cMy feelings are hurt because my mom wouldn\u2019t let me play after school with my friend, so I\u2019ve just been bummed the entire day because I really miss my friend.\u201d My friend who gave me this bruise that was going to last at least a week. Why couldn\u2019t I just kept my mouth shut? Baekhyun always thought I was annoying and the minute Jisoo left, I knew he was going to go for me. But he made her happy and treated her well, so I decided to tough it out. A six-year-old with the bruise the size of a baseball was going to be hard to explain when Jisoo asks.</p><p>Lost in thought I didn\u2019t notice how Taehyung was inching his way towards the bottom of my shirt. In a second he lifted my shirt up and your shirt up and the both of you gasped, his in horror and yours in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d he whispered quietly.</p><p>\u201cI ran into the table at home,\u201d you deadpanned at him trying to not show any tells of lying.</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t, bruises don\u2019t look like that because I\u2019ve run into a number of tables at home. \u00a0Someone hit you didn\u2019t they? Who is it? I\u2019ll get back, you don\u2019t need to accept this, I can get you out.\u201d His eyes became hard and gone was the little boy who was too curious. A boy who knew what it was like to get pushed into a corner and kicked until blood came out of his lips.</p><p>You look at him with a softness you didn\u2019t know that you possessed and hold his hand and give it a small squeeze, \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, I can handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing six does not make me a big boy, so being six does not make you a big girl either. Tell me who did this, please.\u201d He pleads with his puppy dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow about I become friends with you and you stop worrying about me?\u201d you reasoned with him.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d Damn, he was a smart one.</p><p>You gave him a small smile, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we become better friends so you don\u2019t do this out of pity.\u201d Your tone becomes bitter as the word pity leaves your mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis isn&rsquo;t pitying, I genuinely want to protect you, please, trust me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and hopped off the chair leading him back to the cafeteria holding his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Park Jimin since he\u2019ll have a better chance of knowing who it is.\u201d You compromised. For a six-year-old, he sure is observant and hard to trick. Maybe it could be because you\u2019re both six-year-olds, but still, I\u2019m smarter than him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d he pouted at you as you found his usual table and sat across from Taehyung and across from Park Jimin.</p><p>Jimin looks at you and nods his head, knowing who you might be. At the age of six and already you\u2019re a menace to gangs consisting of 20-year-old men.</p><p>Taehyung gently kicks your shin from under the table and you curse at him, as he glares at you and nods his head to Jimin. You roll your eyes and Jimin is already looking at you.</p><p>\u201cBaekhyun.\u201d Is all you say knowing that he would surely already know?</p><p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen and whisper into Tae\u2019s ear. His eyes then widen and you narrow your eyes knowing that it was better left unsaid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about interfering because you\u2019ll cause more trouble than I need,\u201d you said in a serious voice.</p><p>He nodded his head and that was how your friendship began and now\u2026.</p><p>You gaze out the window and realize that Tae already parked the car and was looking at you, holding your hand and rubbing soothing circles on the back of your hand.</p><p>\u201cA thought for a thought?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>You take a breath and then say, \u201cIn another world maybe we could have ended up together, but this is not that world and this is not the life I would have lived if I was given a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn another world, I would have wished that we could be together like that, but we just can\u2019t it would feel like dating my sister and I would relive this entire life just to be with you.\u201d</p><p>You lift up your hands, \u201cHow is this being like this dating your sister?\u201d you quirk an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Alex.\u201d he pauses and looks at you.</p><p>\u201cI might be gay,\u201d he blurts out.</p><p>\u201cHa! I knew it! No straight man can resist me like you do. Then what has all of this been then?\u201d you raise an eyebrow, wanting to make him squirm.</p><p>\u201cUhm, it\u2019s just been testing out whether I would feel something when I kissed you two times, one with we were kids, I felt a spark. Then I kissed you in high school and the spark ebbed away a little, and then in freshman year at college when we went to that party and you got slam dunk drunk, I didn\u2019t feel anything. So I decided to try making something happen and you weren\u2019t helping with that whole friend zone then. So I slept with a girl and it didn\u2019t feel that good. ONe day at HQ I accidentally touched Jimin\u2019s hands and something went through my body. A thrum that I\u2019ve never felt before. I began hanging out with Jimin more and we\u2019ve been dating for three months now.\u201d he adds in sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOSH!!!\u201d you squeal, excited that Taehyung had finally come out. You knew all those years of you trying to subtly date him would make him question his own sexuality when he didn\u2019t get hard at you. You first suspected it when you drunk kissed him and he went really deep, but then he stopped. It wasn\u2019t a stop to rein in his emotions, but because there was no spark. There was no erection between his legs.</p><p>You hug him and kiss him on the lips just to see his reaction.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you\u2019ve known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell when Jimin came to drop off the package and his eyes lingered on your discarded sweatshirt for a little too long, I put two and two together. How could you not want to bang me with all of the advances that I\u2019ve made at you both subtle and obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell someone thinks mighty high of herself.\u201d he jokes as the two of you get out of the car.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>So this is the second chapter, hope you enjoy and Dm me if you want chapter 3 enjot :)</p>",

            "comment": "<p>The two bodyguards slide the intricate gold doors open for you and you flash them a sultry smile as your heels sink into the soft Turkish rugs. The smell of cigarettes and cash greets you as you make your way to the exchange section to get my thousand dollars worth of chips. After the drowsy clerk hands me the stack I walk over to the poker table to oil my rusty tricks. Grabbing a drink from a server I down it in one shot and take an empty seat. You look at your fellow competitors and take them in as you count their cards and their facial expressions. You look at the mid forty year old man who has seen one too many beers with his shirt barely keeping his stomach in. The man on your left who probably has taken crack since he hit puberty, and the guy at the end of the table to the right looks pleasing to the eyes. He has thick brown hair, that makes you want to run your fingers through. His hazel eyes meet yours and the three o\u2019clock shadow makes your toes curl as he smirks. He was going to be your main competition. You lower the neckline of your dress and stick your chest out, sweeping your hair over to your left side to give him a good view. The man shifts in his seat and you know that he\u2019s hooked. He taps the table and the dealer hands him another card. From the clenched jaw you knew he went over and he turns his cards face up.<br></p><p>You look at yours and decide to play the chance of fate. The dealer keeps his eyes on you and you know he was going to be troublesome when you started to win too much. Not wanting to cause a scene so early into the night, you take your small win of $3000 and head to a another table closer to the back, up not as risky. Keeping a blank face you count your cards and easily make a ten thousand dollar bet into a twenty thousand win. Being the ever damsel in distress you aimlessly make your way to the tables in the back where the big spenders usually are. You put on a confused expression and Stumble into a roped off area.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d You look up at the bouncer as he steadies you.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d You ask rather loudly and slur words at the end.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am you\u2019re not permitted to be here.\u201d The scary looking bouncer says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the entrance fee?\u201d You bat your eyelashes as you take your chips out from your clutch.</p><p>\u201cThe starting bid is ten thousand.\u201d The other bouncer says in a monotone voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I can spare a few then?\u201d You give the one in the right a sweet smile and walk past him like a piece of discarded trash.</p><p>You take a seat at a poker table and rest your eyes on the dealer. From the leering smirk, he gives you, you know to puff your chest up a little too high and see his hands don\u2019t falter at all. Well then, I guess we\u2019ll have to do this the hard way.</p><p>Just as you make your first million, you quickly walk out of the room and past the two bodyguards. Taking your phone out you text Yoongi to get the car ready before you have to spill some innocent blood. As you walk past tables, you quick cash in your money and walk out of the building with ten million in cash. The red Ferrari swings by and you slide in as the door slide back into place. Yoongi speeds away and you laugh as you flip through the stacks of hundred dollar bills.</p><p>Yoongi quickly glances at you and asks, \u201cHow much did you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell after growing tired of counting cards, I decided to call in a few favors, as in there\u2019s going to be some bodies for the police to sort through. Don\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t kill them just wrenched them of consciousness. I think I stole my first few millions and then changed that into double digits with pure hard work.\u201d You drone as if you didn\u2019t feel the blood sliding down from your daggers.</p><p>\u201cHow many did you kill?\u201d He deadpans as if he\u2019s asked you this before.</p><p>\u201cOnly one,\u201d you mumble.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he says in a warning tone as you can practically hear the engine screaming as he revs the accelerator.</p><p>\u201cOkay it was five, but they were all bad guys and they deserved it. They killed an entire family and raped five girls. So one guy for every girl raped.\u201d You defend.</p><p>He sighs and looks at you with your hands up.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, how much did you get?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201c10.5 million,\u201d he smirks as if he thinks that he\u2019ll win.</p><p>You laugh and after a few seconds you catch your breath and confess, \u201cI stole ten million, but made twenty million by gambling. The tables were in my favor and a few dealers were in me?\u201d You smirk.</p><p>\u201cWell someone was busy.\u201d He mutters.</p><p>\u201cAw, are you jealous that you couldn\u2019t get laid?\u201d He reaches to grab one of his hands.</p><p>He quickly let\u2019s go and grasps your hand. You rest your head back and lean into his shoulder as your body takes in everything that happens.</p><p>The night reels back in your mind and you remember coming for that sexy three o clock shadow you met at the poker club. Realizing that killing takes a lot of energy you wake up and turn your head to Yoongi and see him ordering some burgers at a drive-through. You smile at him, the smell of oil and fries wakes your brain up and you look out the window and realize that you\u2019re near your apartment.</p><p>After Yoongi pays for the food you open the bag and pull out the burger with fries. After you devour your burger in a few bites and finishing your fries, washing it down with some sprite you look at Yoongi who is snacking on his fries.</p><p>\u201cSo where do you want to go for our next date?\u201d He asks as you sip your drink.</p><p>\u201cHm, what\u2019s the most expensive restaurant in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Crouz, it\u2019s French,\u201d he says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cHow about BBQ?\u201d</p><p>You perk at the thought of fresh meat and the smoky smell of grills with music blasting out in the dark atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cSure. Nothing spontaneous and pricy?\u201d He raises his brows to his platinum blonde hair.</p><p>\u201cWell I like meat and want to eat meat on Friday because I\u2019ll probably be underground, so why not get some meat at the end for a reward?\u201d You mutter the part about the fighting underground so he won\u2019t suspect anything.</p><p>\u201cYou fight?\u201d He asks curiously.</p><p>\u201cWell more like sparr, I just do it to keep up with new techniques and make sure that I can defend myself should some of my enemies choose to get revenge.\u201d You try to brush off, but his hand tilts your chin upwards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d He confesses as it that\u2019s the key to unlock you.</p><p>You divert your eyes and he tugs your gaze back gently. He waits patiently and you sigh as he let\u2019s go.</p><p>\u201cI have years worth of enemies, I have killed countless people and don\u2019t plan to stop, I steal, hack, and do other sorts of illegal things. But I don\u2019t whore myself or do drugs. I\u2019m not sure about this mainly because you might get hurt. By either myself or my enemies.\u201d You say quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve killed too, I also fight and know what it\u2019s like to be in that dark place I -,\u201d</p><p>You shake your head and lean back into the seat resting your head on the headrest.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you smile at the dark and see that it is welcoming after some time. You like being by yourself and not having to worry about people. Me, myself, and I. I don\u2019t need to care about others feelings.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grabs your hand and you turn to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI know, the dark smiles back at you doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>You nod your head slowly and close your eyes as a tear slides them down. The pain of your past taking over your mind. The blood that will always stain your hands. As if being a surgeon who fixes hearts can wash away the blood. Every time you scrub into an O.R. you hope that it\u2019ll get a bit of the old blood that you can never wash off slowly.</p><p>He brushes the tear away with a thumb and you give him a small smile as you thank him for the night and head to your apartment.</p><p>As the door swings open you kick your shoes off at the door and head to the shower to clean the blood that has been drying on your thighs. As you close the bathroom door I slide the two daggers out from the garter and turn on the cold water, letting the water wash away the blood. After their visibly clean you turn on the shower and warm up the water. You quickly wash the smell of cigarettes and alcohol away. After walking out hair wrapped in a towel along with your torso you swipe the blades off the counter and pick up your dress from the floor. You close your bedroom door and wrap the daggers in a piece of old silk as you hide them under your underwears. I take the stacks out of my rather large clutch as if he knew that I was going to win big, I lift one of the floorboards and store it with the rest. I look at the stack of colorful currency, American dollars, Korean won, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The occasional pound and euro have their own place. Sighing I throw the dress into my hamper and fall on the bed, your phone buzzes and you crawl around until your hand finds the cool metal.</p><p>Yoongi: Same time next week?</p><p>Alex: Yep</p><p>Yoongi: I can\u2019t sleep</p><p>Alex: I can so night</p><p>Yoongi: Wow, how heartless are you</p><p>Alex: I used to kill people for a living so I have no heart.</p><p>Yoongi: Well some people need their beauty rest more than others, so night. ;P</p><p>Alex: Night orge.</p><p>I smile at my hilarious comeback and turn off my phone before darkness hit me.</p><p>I wake up to the smell of sausage and bacon, wondering why I\u2019m smelling such delicious food. I roll out of bed and realize that I\u2019m naked as I probably rolled out of the towel at some point in my slumber. I slip on my slipper and grab a silk robe off the back of the door as I walk out into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve been yelling at you to wake up and with some oil and meat, you come rolling in in less than a minute.\u201d Tae comments from the sizzling skillet.</p><p>\u201cWell, this gives me something in return besides your presence.\u201d I draw as you take sausages from the plate.</p><p>I continue munching on the sausage links as Taehyung finishes cooking the rest of the bacon. While he cooks I pour myself some cereal since I don\u2019t really like bacon, it\u2019s too oily for my taste.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to know?\u201d I look up at him as I slurp my cereal.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stay in his car for so long when he parked in the garage for so long,\u201d he says in a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cWere you two making out during that time?\u201d He asks after you slurp more of your cereal.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know we were in the garage?\u201d I raise a brow at him.</p><p>\u201cI rigged the cameras to notify me when his car drove by, I was in the middle of watching a horror movie and all of a sudden sirens went off and scared the shit out of me,\u201d he complains.</p><p>I laugh and eat another sausage link before explaining.</p><p>\u201cWell, in fact, we did have quite the time,\u201d I wiggle my eyebrows, but continue on. \u201cWe did more than just have sex,\u201d Tae\u2019s eyes widen and you smirk. \u201cWe had an emotional conversation revealing our darkest secrets and I confessed about having blood on my hands. He also kills people and we sparked a connection of some sort, like the broken hearts club. I also said that I banged like five guys and killed five guys and he wasn\u2019t scared at all. We\u2019re going on another date next Friday and this time it\u2019s BBQ so I can wear my eating pants.\u201d You finish.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t bang and kill five guys?\u201d he clarifies as if that was the main point of my explanation.</p><p>\u201cWell I didn\u2019t bang five guys, just made out with them and then I killed my five targets, but other than that it was interesting since it\u2019s been a while. I forgot what it was like playing with things at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they deserve it?\u201d he asks in a blank voice, no judgment evident in him.</p><p>I give him a simple nod and he nods back.</p><p>\u201cWant to go to the library to write that essay that\u2019s due on Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure let me put on my nice sweats and then we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice sweats?\u201d he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, the ones that don\u2019t make me look like a trash bag.\u201d I shoot back.</p><p>Quickly changing into an oversized sweatshirt that you stole from Tae back in high school and changing into a pair of sweats with pockets, of course, I make grab my backpack and head out with Tae.</p><p>\u201cWhen you start dating Yoongi will we still be allowed to do this?\u201d \u00a0Tae looks down at you as you notice his arm around your shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNope because from the way Yoongi acts he already knows that he has me hooked and I have him too so I can spend all day in nothing but my sweats and a sports bra and he wouldn\u2019t care. Well maybe he would be there to bang me since I would look hot, but that was all.\u201d As if Yoongi was spying on us somehow the security camera in the elevator seemed to blink.</p><p>\u201cI swear to god Yoongi know the boundaries before I show you the hard way,\u201d I smile sweetly at the camera before discreetly get an eye booger out of from the corner of my eye with my middle finger. Getting the clue, the camera turns on and off again as if nodding.</p><p>You both laugh at how scared Yoongi got.</p><p>\u201cYou really have him whipped with just one date.\u201d Taehyung smirks.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you shrug as you slide into his car and it makes sense now, why you were drawn to him in first grade. He was always too curious for his own good.</p><p>14 years ago\u2026..</p><p>\tMrs. Adams just never followed my requests, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.

I ran after him and caught him by the back of his blazer.</p><p>I dragged Taehyung to a nearby corner and placed him in front of you.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you watching me huh?\u201d I needed to instill fear in him so that he would be too scared to tell on me.</p><p>\u201cI was j-just seeing why you snuck into the principal\u2019s office since that\u2019s against the rules,\u201d he states with his wide eyes.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at how he was such a goody-goody.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell on me and I won\u2019t hurt you, yeah?\u201d I pushed harder into his shoulders.</p><p>He slowly nodded his head.</p><p>The next day when you ate in the library you felt the same pair of eyes on you as you read a human anatomy book.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you eat with Jimin?\u201d I asked without looking up from my book.</p><p>\u201cI realized that I never saw you in the cafeteria and followed you here,\u201d he said quietly as he walked over to your empty table.</p><p>I tried to hide my wince as I flipped a page and his curious eyes didn\u2019t let it go unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d his voice filled with worry.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just wince at seeing all the big words,\u201d I tried to brush off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re hurt, but where?\u201d he scooted closer to inspect you and bit the inside of your cheek to keep out from wincing in pain.</p><p>Even though it was just a bruise, it still hurt to sit and bend my torso. I felt his eyes the minute you entered school this morning and the worried looks he kept on casting at me during class was starting to make the teachers become suspicious. When lunch came I made my way to the library so his questions wouldn\u2019t be heard by other people.</p><p>I sighed and decided to put on a show, \u201cMy feelings are hurt because my mom wouldn\u2019t let me play after school with my friend, so I\u2019ve just been bummed the entire day because I really miss my friend.\u201d My friend who gave me this bruise that was going to last at least a week. Why couldn\u2019t I just kept my mouth shut? Baekhyun always thought I was annoying and the minute Jisoo left, I knew he was going to go for me. But he made her happy and treated her well, so I decided to tough it out. A six-year-old with the bruise the size of a baseball was going to be hard to explain when Jisoo asks.</p><p>Lost in thought I didn\u2019t notice how Taehyung was inching his way towards the bottom of my shirt. In a second he lifted my shirt up and your shirt up and the both of you gasped, his in horror and yours in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d he whispered quietly.</p><p>\u201cI ran into the table at home,\u201d you deadpanned at him trying to not show any tells of lying.</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t, bruises don\u2019t look like that because I\u2019ve run into a number of tables at home. \u00a0Someone hit you didn\u2019t they? Who is it? I\u2019ll get back, you don\u2019t need to accept this, I can get you out.\u201d His eyes became hard and gone was the little boy who was too curious. A boy who knew what it was like to get pushed into a corner and kicked until blood came out of his lips.</p><p>You look at him with a softness you didn\u2019t know that you possessed and hold his hand and give it a small squeeze, \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, I can handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing six does not make me a big boy, so being six does not make you a big girl either. Tell me who did this, please.\u201d He pleads with his puppy dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow about I become friends with you and you stop worrying about me?\u201d you reasoned with him.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d Damn, he was a smart one.</p><p>You gave him a small smile, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we become better friends so you don\u2019t do this out of pity.\u201d Your tone becomes bitter as the word pity leaves your mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t pitying, I genuinely want to protect you, please, trust me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and hopped off the chair leading him back to the cafeteria holding his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Park Jimin since he\u2019ll have a better chance of knowing who it is.\u201d You compromised. For a six-year-old, he sure is observant and hard to trick. Maybe it could be because you\u2019re both six-year-olds, but still, I\u2019m smarter than him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d he pouted at you as you found his usual table and sat across from Taehyung and across from Park Jimin.</p><p>Jimin looks at you and nods his head, knowing who you might be. At the age of six and already you\u2019re a menace to gangs consisting of 20-year-old men.</p><p>Taehyung gently kicks your shin from under the table and you curse at him, as he glares at you and nods his head to Jimin. You roll your eyes and Jimin is already looking at you.</p><p>\u201cBaekhyun.\u201d Is all you say knowing that he would surely already know?</p><p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen and whisper into Tae\u2019s ear. His eyes then widen and you narrow your eyes knowing that it was better left unsaid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about interfering because you\u2019ll cause more trouble than I need,\u201d you said in a serious voice.</p><p>He nodded his head and that was how your friendship began and now\u2026.</p><p>You gaze out the window and realize that Tae already parked the car and was looking at you, holding your hand and rubbing soothing circles on the back of your hand.</p><p>\u201cA thought for a thought?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>You take a breath and then say, \u201cIn another world maybe we could have ended up together, but this is not that world and this is not the life I would have lived if I was given a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn another world, I would have wished that we could be together like that, but we just can\u2019t it would feel like dating my sister and I would relive this entire life just to be with you.\u201d</p><p>You lift up your hands, \u201cHow is this being like this dating your sister?\u201d you quirk an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Alex.\u201d he pauses and looks at you.</p><p>\u201cI might be gay,\u201d he blurts out.</p><p>\u201cHa! I knew it! No straight man can resist me like you do. Then what has all of this been then?\u201d you raise an eyebrow, wanting to make him squirm.</p><p>\u201cUhm, it\u2019s just been testing out whether I would feel something when I kissed you two times, one with we were kids, I felt a spark. Then I kissed you in high school and the spark ebbed away a little, and then in freshman year at college when we went to that party and you got slam dunk drunk, I didn\u2019t feel anything. So I decided to try making something happen and you weren\u2019t helping with that whole friend zone then. So I slept with a girl and it didn\u2019t feel that good. ONe day at HQ I accidentally touched Jimin\u2019s hands and something went through my body. A thrum that I\u2019ve never felt before. I began hanging out with Jimin more and we\u2019ve been dating for three months now.\u201d he adds in sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOSH!!!\u201d you squeal, excited that Taehyung had finally come out. You knew all those years of you trying to subtly date him would make him question his own sexuality when he didn\u2019t get hard at you. You first suspected it when you drunk kissed him and he went really deep, but then he stopped. It wasn\u2019t a stop to rein in his emotions, but because there was no spark. There was no erection between his legs.</p><p>You hug him and kiss him on the lips just to see his reaction.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you\u2019ve known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell when Jimin came to drop off the package and his eyes lingered on your discarded sweatshirt for a little too long, I put two and two together. How could you not want to bang me with all of the advances that I\u2019ve made at you both subtle and obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell someone thinks mighty high of herself.\u201d he jokes as the two of you get out of the car.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So this is the second chapter, hope you enjoy and Dm me if you want chapter 3 enjot :)</p>",

The smell of cigarettes and cash greets you as you make your way to the exchange section to get my thousand dollars worth of chips. After the drowsy clerk hands me the stack I walk over to the poker table to oil my rusty tricks. Grabbing a drink from a server I down it in one shot and take an empty seat. You look at your fellow competitors and take them in as you count their cards and their facial expressions. You look at the mid forty year old man who has seen one too many beers with his shirt barely keeping his stomach in. The man on your left who probably has taken crack since he hit puberty, and the guy at the end of the table to the right looks pleasing to the eyes. He has thick brown hair, that makes you want to run your fingers through. His hazel eyes meet yours and the three o\u2019clock shadow makes your toes curl as he smirks. He was going to be your main competition. You lower the neckline of your dress and stick your chest out, sweeping your hair over to your left side to give him a good view. The man shifts in his seat and you know that he\u2019s hooked. He taps the table and the dealer hands him another card. From the clenched jaw you knew he went over and he turns his cards face up.<br></p><p>You look at yours and decide to play the chance of fate. The dealer keeps his eyes on you and you know he was going to be troublesome when you started to win too much. Not wanting to cause a scene so early into the night, you take your small win of $3000 and head to a another table closer to the back, up not as risky. Keeping a blank face you count your cards and easily make a ten thousand dollar bet into a twenty thousand win. Being the ever damsel in distress you aimlessly make your way to the tables in the back where the big spenders usually are. You put on a confused expression and Stumble into a roped off area.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d You look up at the bouncer as he steadies you.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d You ask rather loudly and slur words at the end.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am you\u2019re not permitted to be here.\u201d The scary looking bouncer says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the entrance fee?\u201d You bat your eyelashes as you take your chips out from your clutch.</p><p>\u201cThe starting bid is ten thousand.\u201d The other bouncer says in a monotone voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I can spare a few then?\u201d You give the one in the right a sweet smile and walk past him like a piece of discarded trash.</p><p>You take a seat at a poker table and rest your eyes on the dealer. From the leering smirk, he gives you, you know to puff your chest up a little too high and see his hands don\u2019t falter at all. Well then, I guess we\u2019ll have to do this the hard way.</p><p>Just as you make your first million, you quickly walk out of the room and past the two bodyguards. Taking your phone out you text Yoongi to get the car ready before you have to spill some innocent blood. As you walk past tables, you quick cash in your money and walk out of the building with ten million in cash. The red Ferrari swings by and you slide in as the door slide back into place. Yoongi speeds away and you laugh as you flip through the stacks of hundred dollar bills.</p><p>Yoongi quickly glances at you and asks, \u201cHow much did you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell after growing tired of counting cards, I decided to call in a few favors, as in there\u2019s going to be some bodies for the police to sort through. Don\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t kill them just wrenched them of consciousness. I think I stole my first few millions and then changed that into double digits with pure hard work.\u201d You drone as if you didn\u2019t feel the blood sliding down from your daggers.</p><p>\u201cHow many did you kill?\u201d He deadpans as if he\u2019s asked you this before.</p><p>\u201cOnly one,\u201d you mumble.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he says in a warning tone as you can practically hear the engine screaming as he revs the accelerator.</p><p>\u201cOkay it was five, but they were all bad guys and they deserved it. They killed an entire family and raped five girls. So one guy for every girl raped.\u201d You defend.</p><p>He sighs and looks at you with your hands up.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, how much did you get?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201c10.5 million,\u201d he smirks as if he thinks that he\u2019ll win.</p><p>You laugh and after a few seconds you catch your breath and confess, \u201cI stole ten million, but made twenty million by gambling. The tables were in my favor and a few dealers were in me?\u201d You smirk.</p><p>\u201cWell someone was busy.\u201d He mutters.</p><p>\u201cAw, are you jealous that you couldn\u2019t get laid?\u201d He reaches to grab one of his hands.</p><p>He quickly let\u2019s go and grasps your hand. You rest your head back and lean into his shoulder as your body takes in everything that happens.</p><p>The night reels back in your mind and you remember coming for that sexy three o clock shadow you met at the poker club. Realizing that killing takes a lot of energy you wake up and turn your head to Yoongi and see him ordering some burgers at a drive-through. You smile at him, the smell of oil and fries wakes your brain up and you look out the window and realize that you\u2019re near your apartment.</p><p>After Yoongi pays for the food you open the bag and pull out the burger with fries. After you devour your burger in a few bites and finishing your fries, washing it down with some sprite you look at Yoongi who is snacking on his fries.</p><p>\u201cSo where do you want to go for our next date?\u201d He asks as you sip your drink.</p><p>\u201cHm, what\u2019s the most expensive restaurant in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Crouz, it\u2019s French,\u201d he says nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cHow about BBQ?\u201d</p><p>You perk at the thought of fresh meat and the smoky smell of grills with music blasting out in the dark atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cSure. Nothing spontaneous and pricy?\u201d He raises his brows to his platinum blonde hair.</p><p>\u201cWell I like meat and want to eat meat on Friday because I\u2019ll probably be underground, so why not get some meat at the end for a reward?\u201d You mutter the part about the fighting underground so he won\u2019t suspect anything.</p><p>\u201cYou fight?\u201d He asks curiously.</p><p>\u201cWell more like sparr, I just do it to keep up with new techniques and make sure that I can defend myself should some of my enemies choose to get revenge.\u201d You try to brush off, but his hand tilts your chin upwards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d He confesses as it that\u2019s the key to unlock you.</p><p>You divert your eyes and he tugs your gaze back gently. He waits patiently and you sigh as he let\u2019s go.</p><p>\u201cI have years worth of enemies, I have killed countless people and don\u2019t plan to stop, I steal, hack, and do other sorts of illegal things. But I don\u2019t whore myself or do drugs. I\u2019m not sure about this mainly because you might get hurt. By either myself or my enemies.\u201d You say quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve killed too, I also fight and know what it\u2019s like to be in that dark place I -,\u201d</p><p>You shake your head and lean back into the seat resting your head on the headrest.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you smile at the dark and see that it is welcoming after some time. You like being by yourself and not having to worry about people. Me, myself, and I. I don\u2019t need to care about others feelings.\u201d</p><p>Yoongi grabs your hand and you turn to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI know, the dark smiles back at you doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>You nod your head slowly and close your eyes as a tear slides them down. The pain of your past taking over your mind. The blood that will always stain your hands. As if being a surgeon who fixes hearts can wash away the blood. Every time you scrub into an O.R. you hope that it\u2019ll get a bit of the old blood that you can never wash off slowly.</p><p>He brushes the tear away with a thumb and you give him a small smile as you thank him for the night and head to your apartment.</p><p>As the door swings open you kick your shoes off at the door and head to the shower to clean the blood that has been drying on your thighs. As you close the bathroom door I slide the two daggers out from the garter and turn on the cold water, letting the water wash away the blood. After their visibly clean you turn on the shower and warm up the water. You quickly wash the smell of cigarettes and alcohol away. After walking out hair wrapped in a towel along with your torso you swipe the blades off the counter and pick up your dress from the floor. You close your bedroom door and wrap the daggers in a piece of old silk as you hide them under your underwears. I take the stacks out of my rather large clutch as if he knew that I was going to win big, I lift one of the floorboards and store it with the rest. I look at the stack of colorful currency, American dollars, Korean won, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The occasional pound and euro have their own place. Sighing I throw the dress into my hamper and fall on the bed, your phone buzzes and you crawl around until your hand finds the cool metal.</p><p>Yoongi: Same time next week?</p><p>Alex: Yep</p><p>Yoongi: I can\u2019t sleep</p><p>Alex: I can so night</p><p>Yoongi: Wow, how heartless are you</p><p>Alex: I used to kill people for a living so I have no heart.</p><p>Yoongi: Well some people need their beauty rest more than others, so night. ;P</p><p>Alex: Night orge.</p><p>I smile at my hilarious comeback and turn off my phone before darkness hit me.</p><p>I wake up to the smell of sausage and bacon, wondering why I\u2019m smelling such delicious food. I roll out of bed and realize that I\u2019m naked as I probably rolled out of the towel at some point in my slumber. I slip on my slipper and grab a silk robe off the back of the door as I walk out into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve been yelling at you to wake up and with some oil and meat, you come rolling in in less than a minute.\u201d Tae comments from the sizzling skillet.</p><p>\u201cWell, this gives me something in return besides your presence.\u201d I draw as you take sausages from the plate.</p><p>I continue munching on the sausage links as Taehyung finishes cooking the rest of the bacon. While he cooks I pour myself some cereal since I don\u2019t really like bacon, it\u2019s too oily for my taste.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to know?\u201d I look up at him as I slurp my cereal.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stay in his car for so long when he parked in the garage for so long,\u201d he says in a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cWere you two making out during that time?\u201d He asks after you slurp more of your cereal.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know we were in the garage?\u201d I raise a brow at him.</p><p>\u201cI rigged the cameras to notify me when his car drove by, I was in the middle of watching a horror movie and all of a sudden sirens went off and scared the shit out of me,\u201d he complains.</p><p>I laugh and eat another sausage link before explaining.</p><p>\u201cWell, in fact, we did have quite the time,\u201d I wiggle my eyebrows, but continue on. \u201cWe did more than just have sex,\u201d Tae\u2019s eyes widen and you smirk. \u201cWe had an emotional conversation revealing our darkest secrets and I confessed about having blood on my hands. He also kills people and we sparked a connection of some sort, like the broken hearts club. I also said that I banged like five guys and killed five guys and he wasn\u2019t scared at all. We\u2019re going on another date next Friday and this time it\u2019s BBQ so I can wear my eating pants.\u201d You finish.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t bang and kill five guys?\u201d he clarifies as if that was the main point of my explanation.</p><p>\u201cWell I didn\u2019t bang five guys, just made out with them and then I killed my five targets, but other than that it was interesting since it\u2019s been a while. I forgot what it was like playing with things at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they deserve it?\u201d he asks in a blank voice, no judgment evident in him.</p><p>I give him a simple nod and he nods back.</p><p>\u201cWant to go to the library to write that essay that\u2019s due on Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure let me put on my nice sweats and then we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice sweats?\u201d he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, the ones that don\u2019t make me look like a trash bag.\u201d I shoot back.</p><p>Quickly changing into an oversized sweatshirt that you stole from Tae back in high school and changing into a pair of sweats with pockets, of course, I make grab my backpack and head out with Tae.</p><p>\u201cWhen you start dating Yoongi will we still be allowed to do this?\u201d \u00a0Tae looks down at you as you notice his arm around your shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNope because from the way Yoongi acts he already knows that he has me hooked and I have him too so I can spend all day in nothing but my sweats and a sports bra and he wouldn\u2019t care. Well maybe he would be there to bang me since I would look hot, but that was all.\u201d As if Yoongi was spying on us somehow the security camera in the elevator seemed to blink.</p><p>\u201cI swear to god Yoongi know the boundaries before I show you the hard way,\u201d I smile sweetly at the camera before discreetly get an eye booger out of from the corner of my eye with my middle finger. Getting the clue, the camera turns on and off again as if nodding.</p><p>You both laugh at how scared Yoongi got.</p><p>\u201cYou really have him whipped with just one date.\u201d Taehyung smirks.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d you shrug as you slide into his car and it makes sense now, why you were drawn to him in first grade. He was always too curious for his own good.</p><p>14 years ago\u2026..</p><p>\tMrs. Adams just never followed my requests, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. After asking to use the bathroom I went into the principal\u2019s office and unlocked her computer with an easy overriding code that you learned from Sehun. I broke into her computer and changed my grade from Mrs. Adam\u2019s class from a C to an A. I quickly closed all the programs and signed out of the editing account I used. As you look for the logout button you see from under the desktop that a pair of dark brown eyes was watching you. I ignore the boy and hopped off the chair and smiled as he darted away. I ran after him and caught him by the back of his blazer.</p><p>I dragged Taehyung to a nearby corner and placed him in front of you.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you watching me huh?\u201d I needed to instill fear in him so that he would be too scared to tell on me.</p><p>\u201cI was j-just seeing why you snuck into the principal\u2019s office since that\u2019s against the rules,\u201d he states with his wide eyes.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at how he was such a goody-goody.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell on me and I won\u2019t hurt you, yeah?\u201d I pushed harder into his shoulders.</p><p>He slowly nodded his head.</p><p>The next day when you ate in the library you felt the same pair of eyes on you as you read a human anatomy book.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you eat with Jimin?\u201d I asked without looking up from my book.</p><p>\u201cI realized that I never saw you in the cafeteria and followed you here,\u201d he said quietly as he walked over to your empty table.</p><p>I tried to hide my wince as I flipped a page and his curious eyes didn\u2019t let it go unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d his voice filled with worry.</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just wince at seeing all the big words,\u201d I tried to brush off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re hurt, but where?\u201d he scooted closer to inspect you and bit the inside of your cheek to keep out from wincing in pain.</p><p>Even though it was just a bruise, it still hurt to sit and bend my torso. I felt his eyes the minute you entered school this morning and the worried looks he kept on casting at me during class was starting to make the teachers become suspicious. When lunch came I made my way to the library so his questions wouldn\u2019t be heard by other people.</p><p>I sighed and decided to put on a show, \u201cMy feelings are hurt because my mom wouldn\u2019t let me play after school with my friend, so I\u2019ve just been bummed the entire day because I really miss my friend.\u201d My friend who gave me this bruise that was going to last at least a week. Why couldn\u2019t I just kept my mouth shut? Baekhyun always thought I was annoying and the minute Jisoo left, I knew he was going to go for me. But he made her happy and treated her well, so I decided to tough it out. A six-year-old with the bruise the size of a baseball was going to be hard to explain when Jisoo asks.</p><p>Lost in thought I didn\u2019t notice how Taehyung was inching his way towards the bottom of my shirt. In a second he lifted my shirt up and your shirt up and the both of you gasped, his in horror and yours in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d he whispered quietly.</p><p>\u201cI ran into the table at home,\u201d you deadpanned at him trying to not show any tells of lying.</p><p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t, bruises don\u2019t look like that because I\u2019ve run into a number of tables at home. \u00a0Someone hit you didn\u2019t they? Who is it? I\u2019ll get back, you don\u2019t need to accept this, I can get you out.\u201d His eyes became hard and gone was the little boy who was too curious. A boy who knew what it was like to get pushed into a corner and kicked until blood came out of his lips.</p><p>You look at him with a softness you didn\u2019t know that you possessed and hold his hand and give it a small squeeze, \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, I can handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing six does not make me a big boy, so being six does not make you a big girl either. Tell me who did this, please.\u201d He pleads with his puppy dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow about I become friends with you and you stop worrying about me?\u201d you reasoned with him.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d Damn, he was a smart one.</p><p>You gave him a small smile, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we become better friends so you don\u2019t do this out of pity.\u201d Your tone becomes bitter as the word pity leaves your mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t pitying, I genuinely want to protect you, please, trust me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and hopped off the chair leading him back to the cafeteria holding his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Park Jimin since he\u2019ll have a better chance of knowing who it is.\u201d You compromised. For a six-year-old, he sure is observant and hard to trick. Maybe it could be because you\u2019re both six-year-olds, but still, I\u2019m smarter than him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d he pouted at you as you found his usual table and sat across from Taehyung and across from Park Jimin.</p><p>Jimin looks at you and nods his head, knowing who you might be. At the age of six and already you\u2019re a menace to gangs consisting of 20-year-old men.</p><p>Taehyung gently kicks your shin from under the table and you curse at him, as he glares at you and nods his head to Jimin. You roll your eyes and Jimin is already looking at you.</p><p>\u201cBaekhyun.\u201d Is all you say knowing that he would surely already know?</p><p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen and whisper into Tae\u2019s ear. His eyes then widen and you narrow your eyes knowing that it was better left unsaid.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about interfering because you\u2019ll cause more trouble than I need,\u201d you said in a serious voice.</p><p>He nodded his head and that was how your friendship began and now\u2026.</p><p>You gaze out the window and realize that Tae already parked the car and was looking at you, holding your hand and rubbing soothing circles on the back of your hand.</p><p>\u201cA thought for a thought?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>You take a breath and then say, \u201cIn another world maybe we could have ended up together, but this is not that world and this is not the life I would have lived if I was given a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn another world, I would have wished that we could be together like that, but we just can\u2019t it would feel like dating my sister and I would relive this entire life just to be with you.\u201d</p><p>You lift up your hands, \u201cHow is this being like this dating your sister?\u201d you quirk an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cUhm, Alex.\u201d he pauses and looks at you.</p><p>\u201cI might be gay,\u201d he blurts out.</p><p>\u201cHa! I knew it! No straight man can resist me like you do. Then what has all of this been then?\u201d you raise an eyebrow, wanting to make him squirm.</p><p>\u201cUhm, it\u2019s just been testing out whether I would feel something when I kissed you two times, one with we were kids, I felt a spark. Then I kissed you in high school and the spark ebbed away a little, and then in freshman year at college when we went to that party and you got slam dunk drunk, I didn\u2019t feel anything. So I decided to try making something happen and you weren\u2019t helping with that whole friend zone then. So I slept with a girl and it didn\u2019t feel that good. ONe day at HQ I accidentally touched Jimin\u2019s hands and something went through my body. A thrum that I\u2019ve never felt before. I began hanging out with Jimin more and we\u2019ve been dating for three months now.\u201d he adds in sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOSH!!!\u201d you squeal, excited that Taehyung had finally come out. You knew all those years of you trying to subtly date him would make him question his own sexuality when he didn\u2019t get hard at you. You first suspected it when you drunk kissed him and he went really deep, but then he stopped. It wasn\u2019t a stop to rein in his emotions, but because there was no spark. There was no erection between his legs.</p><p>You hug him and kiss him on the lips just to see his reaction.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you\u2019ve known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell when Jimin came to drop off the package and his eyes lingered on your discarded sweatshirt for a little too long, I put two and two together. How could you not want to bang me with all of the advances that I\u2019ve made at you both subtle and obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell someone thinks mighty high of herself.\u201d he jokes as the two of you get out of the car.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So this is the second chapter, hope you enjoy and Dm me if you want chapter 3 enjot :)</p>",
                "content": "<p>The two bodyguards slide the intricate gold doors open for you and you flash them a sultry smile as your heels sink into the soft Turkish rugs. The smell of cigarettes and cash greets you as you make your way to the exchange section to get my thousand dollars worth of chips. After the drowsy clerk hands me the stack I walk over to the poker table to oil my rusty tricks. Grabbing a drink from a server I down it in one shot and take an empty seat. You look at your fellow competitors and take them in as you count their cards and their facial expressions. You look at the mid forty year old man who has seen one too many beers with his shirt barely keeping his stomach in. The man on your left who probably has taken crack since he hit puberty, and the guy at the end of the table to the right looks pleasing to the eyes. He has thick brown hair, that makes you want to run your fingers through. His hazel eyes meet yours and the three o&rsquo;clock shadow makes your toes curl as he smirks. He was going to be your main competition. You lower the neckline of your dress and stick your chest out, sweeping your hair over to your left side to give him a good view. The man shifts in his seat and you know that he&rsquo;s hooked. He taps the table and the dealer hands him another card. From the clenched jaw you knew he went over and he turns his cards face up.<br /></p><p>You look at yours and decide to play the chance of fate. The dealer keeps his eyes on you and you know he was going to be troublesome when you started to win too much. Not wanting to cause a scene so early into the night, you take your small win of $3000 and head to a another table closer to the back, up not as risky. Keeping a blank face you count your cards and easily make a ten thousand dollar bet into a twenty thousand win. Being the ever damsel in distress you aimlessly make your way to the tables in the back where the big spenders usually are. You put on a confused expression and Stumble into a roped off area.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; You look up at the bouncer as he steadies you.</p><p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; You ask rather loudly and slur words at the end.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am you&rsquo;re not permitted to be here.&rdquo; The scary looking bouncer says.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the entrance fee?&rdquo; You bat your eyelashes as you take your chips out from your clutch.</p><p>&ldquo;The starting bid is ten thousand.&rdquo; The other bouncer says in a monotone voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I can spare a few then?&rdquo; You give the one in the right a sweet smile and walk past him like a piece of discarded trash.</p><p>You take a seat at a poker table and rest your eyes on the dealer. From the leering smirk, he gives you, you know to puff your chest up a little too high and see his hands don&rsquo;t falter at all. Well then, I guess we&rsquo;ll have to do this the hard way.</p><p>Just as you make your first million, you quickly walk out of the room and past the two bodyguards. Taking your phone out you text Yoongi to get the car ready before you have to spill some innocent blood. As you walk past tables, you quick cash in your money and walk out of the building with ten million in cash. The red Ferrari swings by and you slide in as the door slide back into place. Yoongi speeds away and you laugh as you flip through the stacks of hundred dollar bills.</p><p>Yoongi quickly glances at you and asks, &ldquo;How much did you get?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well after growing tired of counting cards, I decided to call in a few favors, as in there&rsquo;s going to be some bodies for the police to sort through. Don&rsquo;t worry I didn&rsquo;t kill them just wrenched them of consciousness. I think I stole my first few millions and then changed that into double digits with pure hard work.&rdquo; You drone as if you didn&rsquo;t feel the blood sliding down from your daggers.</p><p>&ldquo;How many did you kill?&rdquo; He deadpans as if he&rsquo;s asked you this before.</p><p>&ldquo;Only one,&rdquo; you mumble.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he says in a warning tone as you can practically hear the engine screaming as he revs the accelerator.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay it was five, but they were all bad guys and they deserved it. They killed an entire family and raped five girls. So one guy for every girl raped.&rdquo; You defend.</p><p>He sighs and looks at you with your hands up.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he rolls his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, how much did you get?&rdquo; You ask.</p><p>&ldquo;10.5 million,&rdquo; he smirks as if he thinks that he&rsquo;ll win.</p><p>You laugh and after a few seconds you catch your breath and confess, &ldquo;I stole ten million, but made twenty million by gambling. The tables were in my favor and a few dealers were in me?&rdquo; You smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Well someone was busy.&rdquo; He mutters.</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, are you jealous that you couldn&rsquo;t get laid?&rdquo; He reaches to grab one of his hands.</p><p>He quickly let&rsquo;s go and grasps your hand. You rest your head back and lean into his shoulder as your body takes in everything that happens.</p><p>The night reels back in your mind and you remember coming for that sexy three o clock shadow you met at the poker club. Realizing that killing takes a lot of energy you wake up and turn your head to Yoongi and see him ordering some burgers at a drive-through. You smile at him, the smell of oil and fries wakes your brain up and you look out the window and realize that you&rsquo;re near your apartment.</p><p>After Yoongi pays for the food you open the bag and pull out the burger with fries. After you devour your burger in a few bites and finishing your fries, washing it down with some sprite you look at Yoongi who is snacking on his fries.</p><p>&ldquo;So where do you want to go for our next date?&rdquo; He asks as you sip your drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, what&rsquo;s the most expensive restaurant in town?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;La Crouz, it&rsquo;s French,&rdquo; he says nonchalantly.</p><p>&ldquo;How about BBQ?&rdquo;</p><p>You perk at the thought of fresh meat and the smoky smell of grills with music blasting out in the dark atmosphere.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. Nothing spontaneous and pricy?&rdquo; He raises his brows to his platinum blonde hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I like meat and want to eat meat on Friday because I&rsquo;ll probably be underground, so why not get some meat at the end for a reward?&rdquo; You mutter the part about the fighting underground so he won&rsquo;t suspect anything.</p><p>&ldquo;You fight?&rdquo; He asks curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Well more like sparr, I just do it to keep up with new techniques and make sure that I can defend myself should some of my enemies choose to get revenge.&rdquo; You try to brush off, but his hand tilts your chin upwards.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo; He confesses as it that&rsquo;s the key to unlock you.</p><p>You divert your eyes and he tugs your gaze back gently. He waits patiently and you sigh as he let&rsquo;s go.</p><p>&ldquo;I have years worth of enemies, I have killed countless people and don&rsquo;t plan to stop, I steal, hack, and do other sorts of illegal things. But I don&rsquo;t whore myself or do drugs. I&rsquo;m not sure about this mainly because you might get hurt. By either myself or my enemies.&rdquo; You say quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed too, I also fight and know what it&rsquo;s like to be in that dark place I -,&rdquo;</p><p>You shake your head and lean back into the seat resting your head on the headrest.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes you smile at the dark and see that it is welcoming after some time. You like being by yourself and not having to worry about people. Me, myself, and I. I don&rsquo;t need to care about others feelings.&rdquo;</p><p>Yoongi grabs your hand and you turn to look at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, the dark smiles back at you doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>You nod your head slowly and close your eyes as a tear slides them down. The pain of your past taking over your mind. The blood that will always stain your hands. As if being a surgeon who fixes hearts can wash away the blood. Every time you scrub into an O.R. you hope that it&rsquo;ll get a bit of the old blood that you can never wash off slowly.</p><p>He brushes the tear away with a thumb and you give him a small smile as you thank him for the night and head to your apartment.</p><p>As the door swings open you kick your shoes off at the door and head to the shower to clean the blood that has been drying on your thighs. As you close the bathroom door I slide the two daggers out from the garter and turn on the cold water, letting the water wash away the blood. After their visibly clean you turn on the shower and warm up the water. You quickly wash the smell of cigarettes and alcohol away. After walking out hair wrapped in a towel along with your torso you swipe the blades off the counter and pick up your dress from the floor. You close your bedroom door and wrap the daggers in a piece of old silk as you hide them under your underwears. I take the stacks out of my rather large clutch as if he knew that I was going to win big, I lift one of the floorboards and store it with the rest. I look at the stack of colorful currency, American dollars, Korean won, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The occasional pound and euro have their own place. Sighing I throw the dress into my hamper and fall on the bed, your phone buzzes and you crawl around until your hand finds the cool metal.</p><p>Yoongi: Same time next week?</p><p>Alex: Yep</p><p>Yoongi: I can&rsquo;t sleep</p><p>Alex: I can so night</p><p>Yoongi: Wow, how heartless are you</p><p>Alex: I used to kill people for a living so I have no heart.</p><p>Yoongi: Well some people need their beauty rest more than others, so night. ;P</p><p>Alex: Night orge.</p><p>I smile at my hilarious comeback and turn off my phone before darkness hit me.</p><p>I wake up to the smell of sausage and bacon, wondering why I&rsquo;m smelling such delicious food. I roll out of bed and realize that I&rsquo;m naked as I probably rolled out of the towel at some point in my slumber. I slip on my slipper and grab a silk robe off the back of the door as I walk out into the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how many times I&rsquo;ve been yelling at you to wake up and with some oil and meat, you come rolling in in less than a minute.&rdquo; Tae comments from the sizzling skillet.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this gives me something in return besides your presence.&rdquo; I draw as you take sausages from the plate.</p><p>I continue munching on the sausage links as Taehyung finishes cooking the rest of the bacon. While he cooks I pour myself some cereal since I don&rsquo;t really like bacon, it&rsquo;s too oily for my taste.</p><p>&ldquo;So what do you want to know?&rdquo; I look up at him as I slurp my cereal.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you stay in his car for so long when he parked in the garage for so long,&rdquo; he says in a serious tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Were you two making out during that time?&rdquo; He asks after you slurp more of your cereal.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know we were in the garage?&rdquo; I raise a brow at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I rigged the cameras to notify me when his car drove by, I was in the middle of watching a horror movie and all of a sudden sirens went off and scared the shit out of me,&rdquo; he complains.</p><p>I laugh and eat another sausage link before explaining.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, in fact, we did have quite the time,&rdquo; I wiggle my eyebrows, but continue on. &ldquo;We did more than just have sex,&rdquo; Tae&rsquo;s eyes widen and you smirk. &ldquo;We had an emotional conversation revealing our darkest secrets and I confessed about having blood on my hands. He also kills people and we sparked a connection of some sort, like the broken hearts club. I also said that I banged like five guys and killed five guys and he wasn&rsquo;t scared at all. We&rsquo;re going on another date next Friday and this time it&rsquo;s BBQ so I can wear my eating pants.&rdquo; You finish.</p><p>&ldquo;So you didn&rsquo;t bang and kill five guys?&rdquo; he clarifies as if that was the main point of my explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I didn&rsquo;t bang five guys, just made out with them and then I killed my five targets, but other than that it was interesting since it&rsquo;s been a while. I forgot what it was like playing with things at stake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did they deserve it?&rdquo; he asks in a blank voice, no judgment evident in him.</p><p>I give him a simple nod and he nods back.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to go to the library to write that essay that&rsquo;s due on Monday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure let me put on my nice sweats and then we can go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice sweats?&rdquo; he rolls his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the ones that don&rsquo;t make me look like a trash bag.&rdquo; I shoot back.</p><p>Quickly changing into an oversized sweatshirt that you stole from Tae back in high school and changing into a pair of sweats with pockets, of course, I make grab my backpack and head out with Tae.</p><p>&ldquo;When you start dating Yoongi will we still be allowed to do this?&rdquo; &nbsp;Tae looks down at you as you notice his arm around your shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope because from the way Yoongi acts he already knows that he has me hooked and I have him too so I can spend all day in nothing but my sweats and a sports bra and he wouldn&rsquo;t care. Well maybe he would be there to bang me since I would look hot, but that was all.&rdquo; As if Yoongi was spying on us somehow the security camera in the elevator seemed to blink.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear to god Yoongi know the boundaries before I show you the hard way,&rdquo; I smile sweetly at the camera before discreetly get an eye booger out of from the corner of my eye with my middle finger. Getting the clue, the camera turns on and off again as if nodding.</p><p>You both laugh at how scared Yoongi got.</p><p>&ldquo;You really have him whipped with just one date.&rdquo; Taehyung smirks.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you shrug as you slide into his car and it makes sense now, why you were drawn to him in first grade. He was always too curious for his own good.</p><p>14 years ago&hellip;..</p><p>\tMrs. Adams just never followed my requests, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.

His eyes then widen and you narrow your eyes knowing that it was better left unsaid.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about interfering because you&rsquo;ll cause more trouble than I need,&rdquo; you said in a serious voice.</p><p>He nodded his head and that was how your friendship began and now&hellip;.</p><p>You gaze out the window and realize that Tae already parked the car and was looking at you, holding your hand and rubbing soothing circles on the back of your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;A thought for a thought?&rdquo; he asks quietly.</p><p>You take a breath and then say, &ldquo;In another world maybe we could have ended up together, but this is not that world and this is not the life I would have lived if I was given a choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In another world, I would have wished that we could be together like that, but we just can&rsquo;t it would feel like dating my sister and I would relive this entire life just to be with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You lift up your hands, &ldquo;How is this being like this dating your sister?&rdquo; you quirk an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, Alex.&rdquo; he pauses and looks at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I might be gay,&rdquo; he blurts out.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! I knew it! No straight man can resist me like you do. Then what has all of this been then?&rdquo; you raise an eyebrow, wanting to make him squirm.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, it&rsquo;s just been testing out whether I would feel something when I kissed you two times, one with we were kids, I felt a spark. Then I kissed you in high school and the spark ebbed away a little, and then in freshman year at college when we went to that party and you got slam dunk drunk, I didn&rsquo;t feel anything. So I decided to try making something happen and you weren&rsquo;t helping with that whole friend zone then. So I slept with a girl and it didn&rsquo;t feel that good. ONe day at HQ I accidentally touched Jimin&rsquo;s hands and something went through my body. A thrum that I&rsquo;ve never felt before. I began hanging out with Jimin more and we&rsquo;ve been dating for three months now.&rdquo; he adds in sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;OH MY GOSH!!!&rdquo; you squeal, excited that Taehyung had finally come out. You knew all those years of you trying to subtly date him would make him question his own sexuality when he didn&rsquo;t get hard at you. You first suspected it when you drunk kissed him and he went really deep, but then he stopped. It wasn&rsquo;t a stop to rein in his emotions, but because there was no spark. There was no erection between his legs.</p><p>You hug him and kiss him on the lips just to see his reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you&rsquo;ve known?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well when Jimin came to drop off the package and his eyes lingered on your discarded sweatshirt for a little too long, I put two and two together. How could you not want to bang me with all of the advances that I&rsquo;ve made at you both subtle and obvious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well someone thinks mighty high of herself.&rdquo; he jokes as the two of you get out of the car.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>So this is the second chapter, hope you enjoy and Dm me if you want chapter 3 enjot :)</p>",
