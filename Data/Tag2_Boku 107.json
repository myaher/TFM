        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nAizawa adopted Eri, basically, and she\u2019s going to be living in U.A. for the\ntime being with Mirio helping to look after her. The Pussycats (and Kouta!!)\npaid a visit to the 1-A dorms. Kouta had red Deku shoes and I died of cute. We learned about the JP Hero\nBillboard Chart, which updates its rankings twice a year. We then cut to the\nlive event, where the top 10 heroes came out on stage and the new rankings were\nmade official. There were not nearly enough ladies in the rankings, which is\nsome bullshit, but tbh that\u2019s a problem with superhero media in\ngeneral, so BnHA isn\u2019t exactly an outlier in this respect. Anyway, we met some\nnew heroes like Old Man Samurai and Literally A Washing Machine, and found out\nthat Kamui Woods had actually cracked the top 10, taking the #7 spot. My denim\nboi Supreme Best Jeanist moved up to number three, and we <i>finally</i> learned the identity of the former #3 and now #2 hero,\nHawks. And of course Endeavor is now the official #1, and to celebrate he got a\nnew costume. Hooray I guess.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>The newly ranked top ten heroes share their comments with the crowd. Most of them are subdued, aware of the weight that\u2019s fallen on their collective shoulders in the wake of All Might\u2019s retirement. Finally Hawks gets fed up and drags the others for giving bland and\u00a0\u201csafe\u201d answers during such a tumultuous time when the world is looking for more from the heroes they have left. We learn that Hawks, who is only 22, is basically a prodigy and the youngest hero ever to make the top ten. Having said his piece, he hands the mic to Endeavor, who simply says\u00a0\u201cwatch me\u201d and leaves it at that. Later on backstage, Endeavor confronts Hawks about putting him on the spot. Hawks confesses that he was trying to help him, and that with All Might gone the world needs a new iconic figure who can help put them at ease. He thinks Endeavor fits the bill. And also he wants to request a team-up with him regarding the Noumus! Remember them? Well speaking of, the chapter ends with a cut to an unknown location where a shadowy figure is speaking to a new\u00a0\u201cHigh End\u201d Noumu who can <i>fucking talk</i>. So yeah. That\u2019s a thing now.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

I want League of Villains schemes. <i>real</i>\nLeague of Villains schemes again, goddammit!</li></ul><p>(ETA: fff this arc was basically a fucking tease. mysterious\nNoumus with abilities belonging to individuals known to be currently\nincarcerated! with their quirks still intact as far as we know! though it did\noccur to me that Twice might have cloned some of them and AFO might have done\nsome experimentation before he was captured? and another thing that only just\noccurred to me now is that we never found out who that doctor was or what his\ndeal is. the one from chapter 59. he might be more involved in the Noumu-making\nthan we knew. in fact we really don\u2019t know much about the Noumu at all, and\nthis arc only leaves us with more questions. basically I really liked it but I\nneed to know more ugh!</p><p>and that of course is not even getting into the <i>other</i> LoV development that happens in\nthis arc. but we\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk about that later lol.)</p><ul><li>oh my god I\u2019m so hyped y\u2019all someone hold me</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>BONUS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aitaikimochii/status/1036824991382159360?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">hey bnha fans it\u2019s me ya boi</a></p><p><br/></p><ul><li>HE LIKES CHICKEN WHAT IS THIS. DOES THAT COUNT AS CANNIBALISM</li><li>so I looked up Mashin Hero Wataru and it looks like your basic mecha anime but there is indeed a character who is 100% a big bird dude. FALCO PUNCH</li><li>I love that when he originally told the staff\u00a0\u201cHEY GUYS THE NUMBER TWO HERO IS GONNA BE A BIG BIRD DUDE\u201d the staff was all\u00a0\u201c&hellip;yay&hellip;\u201d and then when he ended up having to change it they were just like\u00a0\u201cOH WHAT A SHAME\u201d lol.\u00a0\u201coh shit sensei that\u2019s really rough man. oh but he\u2019s hot now? oh&hellip; I guess we\u2019ll just have to live with it\u201d</li><li>and so I said this in the tags from yesterday\u2019s post, but yeah, I would have loved if the number two hero had been female. I think a gender-swapped Hawks would have been badass. alternately I would have also accepted a gender-swapped Edgeshot or even Best Jeanist. but basically the ratio of male to female heroes is a real bummer for me in a series that I by and large love otherwise. I really hope that this changes with Izuku\u2019s generation and Momo or Ochako (or Mina! or Tsuyu! or Kendou! there are so many cool girls) make it into the top 3</li><li>lastly, I\u2019m kind of surprised that his actual name is still apparently a secret. is it going to be some big reveal or something? or maybe Horikoshi just hasn\u2019t settled on one yet, given how much thought he typically puts into names, and how complex a character he is. but I\u2019m curious now dammit</li></ul>",

I want League of Villains schemes. <i>real</i>\nLeague of Villains schemes again, goddammit!</li></ul><p>(ETA: fff this arc was basically a fucking tease. mysterious\nNoumus with abilities belonging to individuals known to be currently\nincarcerated! with their quirks still intact as far as we know! though it did\noccur to me that Twice might have cloned some of them and AFO might have done\nsome experimentation before he was captured? and another thing that only just\noccurred to me now is that we never found out who that doctor was or what his\ndeal is. the one from chapter 59. he might be more involved in the Noumu-making\nthan we knew. in fact we really don\u2019t know much about the Noumu at all, and\nthis arc only leaves us with more questions. basically I really liked it but I\nneed to know more ugh!</p><p>and that of course is not even getting into the <i>other</i> LoV development that happens in\nthis arc. but we\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk about that later lol.)</p><ul><li>oh my god I\u2019m so hyped y\u2019all someone hold me</li></ul><p><br></p><p>BONUS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aitaikimochii/status/1036824991382159360?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">hey bnha fans it\u2019s me ya boi</a></p><p><br></p><ul><li>HE LIKES CHICKEN WHAT IS THIS. DOES THAT COUNT AS CANNIBALISM</li><li>so I looked up Mashin Hero Wataru and it looks like your basic mecha anime but there is indeed a character who is 100% a big bird dude. FALCO PUNCH</li><li>I love that when he originally told the staff\u00a0\u201cHEY GUYS THE NUMBER TWO HERO IS GONNA BE A BIG BIRD DUDE\u201d the staff was all\u00a0\u201c\u2026yay\u2026\u201d and then when he ended up having to change it they were just like\u00a0\u201cOH WHAT A SHAME\u201d lol.\u00a0\u201coh shit sensei that\u2019s really rough man. oh but he\u2019s hot now? oh\u2026 I guess we\u2019ll just have to live with it\u201d</li><li>and so I said this in the tags from yesterday\u2019s post, but yeah, I would have loved if the number two hero had been female. I think a gender-swapped Hawks would have been badass. alternately I would have also accepted a gender-swapped Edgeshot or even Best Jeanist. but basically the ratio of male to female heroes is a real bummer for me in a series that I by and large love otherwise. I really hope that this changes with Izuku\u2019s generation and Momo or Ochako (or Mina! or Tsuyu! or Kendou! there are so many cool girls) make it into the top 3</li><li>lastly, I\u2019m kind of surprised that his actual name is still apparently a secret. is it going to be some big reveal or something? or maybe Horikoshi just hasn\u2019t settled on one yet, given how much thought he typically puts into names, and how complex a character he is. but I\u2019m curious now dammit</li></ul></p>",

The Pussycats (and Kouta!!)\npaid a visit to the 1-A dorms. Kouta had red Deku shoes and I died of cute. We learned about the JP Hero\nBillboard Chart, which updates its rankings twice a year. We then cut to the\nlive event, where the top 10 heroes came out on stage and the new rankings were\nmade official. There were not nearly enough ladies in the rankings, which is\nsome bullshit, but tbh that\u2019s a problem with superhero media in\ngeneral, so BnHA isn\u2019t exactly an outlier in this respect. Anyway, we met some\nnew heroes like Old Man Samurai and Literally A Washing Machine, and found out\nthat Kamui Woods had actually cracked the top 10, taking the #7 spot. My denim\nboi Supreme Best Jeanist moved up to number three, and we <i>finally</i> learned the identity of the former #3 and now #2 hero,\nHawks. And of course Endeavor is now the official #1, and to celebrate he got a\nnew costume. Hooray I guess.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>The newly ranked top ten heroes share their comments with the crowd. Most of them are subdued, aware of the weight that\u2019s fallen on their collective shoulders in the wake of All Might\u2019s retirement. Finally Hawks gets fed up and drags the others for giving bland and\u00a0\u201csafe\u201d answers during such a tumultuous time when the world is looking for more from the heroes they have left. We learn that Hawks, who is only 22, is basically a prodigy and the youngest hero ever to make the top ten. Having said his piece, he hands the mic to Endeavor, who simply says\u00a0\u201cwatch me\u201d and leaves it at that. Later on backstage, Endeavor confronts Hawks about putting him on the spot. Hawks confesses that he was trying to help him, and that with All Might gone the world needs a new iconic figure who can help put them at ease. He thinks Endeavor fits the bill. And also he wants to request a team-up with him regarding the Noumus! Remember them? Well speaking of, the chapter ends with a cut to an unknown location where a shadowy figure is speaking to a new\u00a0\u201cHigh End\u201d Noumu who can <i>fucking talk</i>. So yeah.

I want League of Villains schemes. <i>real</i>\nLeague of Villains schemes again, goddammit!</li></ul><p>(ETA: fff this arc was basically a fucking tease. mysterious\nNoumus with abilities belonging to individuals known to be currently\nincarcerated! with their quirks still intact as far as we know! though it did\noccur to me that Twice might have cloned some of them and AFO might have done\nsome experimentation before he was captured? and another thing that only just\noccurred to me now is that we never found out who that doctor was or what his\ndeal is. the one from chapter 59. he might be more involved in the Noumu-making\nthan we knew. in fact we really don\u2019t know much about the Noumu at all, and\nthis arc only leaves us with more questions. basically I really liked it but I\nneed to know more ugh!</p><p>and that of course is not even getting into the <i>other</i> LoV development that happens in\nthis arc. but we\u2019ll have plenty of time to talk about that later lol.)</p><ul><li>oh my god I\u2019m so hyped y\u2019all someone hold me</li></ul><p><br></p><p>BONUS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aitaikimochii/status/1036824991382159360?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">hey bnha fans it\u2019s me ya boi</a></p><p><br></p><ul><li>HE LIKES CHICKEN WHAT IS THIS. DOES THAT COUNT AS CANNIBALISM</li><li>so I looked up Mashin Hero Wataru and it looks like your basic mecha anime but there is indeed a character who is 100% a big bird dude. FALCO PUNCH</li><li>I love that when he originally told the staff\u00a0\u201cHEY GUYS THE NUMBER TWO HERO IS GONNA BE A BIG BIRD DUDE\u201d the staff was all\u00a0\u201c\u2026yay\u2026\u201d and then when he ended up having to change it they were just like\u00a0\u201cOH WHAT A SHAME\u201d lol.\u00a0\u201coh shit sensei that\u2019s really rough man. oh but he\u2019s hot now? oh\u2026 I guess we\u2019ll just have to live with it\u201d</li><li>and so I said this in the tags from yesterday\u2019s post, but yeah, I would have loved if the number two hero had been female. I think a gender-swapped Hawks would have been badass. alternately I would have also accepted a gender-swapped Edgeshot or even Best Jeanist. but basically the ratio of male to female heroes is a real bummer for me in a series that I by and large love otherwise. I really hope that this changes with Izuku\u2019s generation and Momo or Ochako (or Mina! or Tsuyu! or Kendou! there are so many cool girls) make it into the top 3</li><li>lastly, I\u2019m kind of surprised that his actual name is still apparently a secret. is it going to be some big reveal or something? or maybe Horikoshi just hasn\u2019t settled on one yet, given how much thought he typically puts into names, and how complex a character he is. but I\u2019m curious now dammit</li></ul></p>",
                "content": "<p><p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nAizawa adopted Eri, basically, and she&rsquo;s going to be living in U.A. for the\ntime being with Mirio helping to look after her. The Pussycats (and Kouta!!)\npaid a visit to the 1-A dorms. Kouta had red Deku shoes and I died of cute. We learned about the JP Hero\nBillboard Chart, which updates its rankings twice a year. We then cut to the\nlive event, where the top 10 heroes came out on stage and the new rankings were\nmade official. There were not nearly enough ladies in the rankings, which is\nsome bullshit, but tbh that&rsquo;s a problem with superhero media in\ngeneral, so BnHA isn&rsquo;t exactly an outlier in this respect. Anyway, we met some\nnew heroes like Old Man Samurai and Literally A Washing Machine, and found out\nthat Kamui Woods had actually cracked the top 10, taking the #7 spot. My denim\nboi Supreme Best Jeanist moved up to number three, and we <i>finally</i> learned the identity of the former #3 and now #2 hero,\nHawks. And of course Endeavor is now the official #1, and to celebrate he got a\nnew costume. Hooray I guess.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>The newly ranked top ten heroes share their comments with the crowd. Most of them are subdued, aware of the weight that&rsquo;s fallen on their collective shoulders in the wake of All Might&rsquo;s retirement. Finally Hawks gets fed up and drags the others for giving bland and&nbsp;&ldquo;safe&rdquo; answers during such a tumultuous time when the world is looking for more from the heroes they have left. We learn that Hawks, who is only 22, is basically a prodigy and the youngest hero ever to make the top ten. Having said his piece, he hands the mic to Endeavor, who simply says&nbsp;&ldquo;watch me&rdquo; and leaves it at that. Later on backstage, Endeavor confronts Hawks about putting him on the spot. Hawks confesses that he was trying to help him, and that with All Might gone the world needs a new iconic figure who can help put them at ease. He thinks Endeavor fits the bill. And also he wants to request a team-up with him regarding the Noumus! Remember them? Well speaking of, the chapter ends with a cut to an unknown location where a shadowy figure is speaking to a new&nbsp;&ldquo;High End&rdquo; Noumu who can <i>fucking talk</i>. So yeah. That&rsquo;s a thing now.</p><p><br /></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

I want League of Villains schemes. <i>real</i>\nLeague of Villains schemes again, goddammit!</li></ul><p>(ETA: fff this arc was basically a fucking tease. mysterious\nNoumus with abilities belonging to individuals known to be currently\nincarcerated! with their quirks still intact as far as we know! though it did\noccur to me that Twice might have cloned some of them and AFO might have done\nsome experimentation before he was captured? and another thing that only just\noccurred to me now is that we never found out who that doctor was or what his\ndeal is. the one from chapter 59. he might be more involved in the Noumu-making\nthan we knew. in fact we really don&rsquo;t know much about the Noumu at all, and\nthis arc only leaves us with more questions. basically I really liked it but I\nneed to know more ugh!</p><p>and that of course is not even getting into the <i>other</i> LoV development that happens in\nthis arc. but we&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to talk about that later lol.)</p><ul><li>oh my god I&rsquo;m so hyped y&rsquo;all someone hold me</li></ul><p><br /></p><p>BONUS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aitaikimochii/status/1036824991382159360?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">hey bnha fans it&rsquo;s me ya boi</a></p><p><br /></p><ul><li>HE LIKES CHICKEN WHAT IS THIS. DOES THAT COUNT AS CANNIBALISM</li><li>so I looked up Mashin Hero Wataru and it looks like your basic mecha anime but there is indeed a character who is 100% a big bird dude. FALCO PUNCH</li><li>I love that when he originally told the staff&nbsp;&ldquo;HEY GUYS THE NUMBER TWO HERO IS GONNA BE A BIG BIRD DUDE&rdquo; the staff was all&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;yay&hellip;&rdquo; and then when he ended up having to change it they were just like&nbsp;&ldquo;OH WHAT A SHAME&rdquo; lol.&nbsp;&ldquo;oh shit sensei that&rsquo;s really rough man. oh but he&rsquo;s hot now? oh&hellip; I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to live with it&rdquo;</li><li>and so I said this in the tags from yesterday&rsquo;s post, but yeah, I would have loved if the number two hero had been female. I think a gender-swapped Hawks would have been badass. alternately I would have also accepted a gender-swapped Edgeshot or even Best Jeanist. but basically the ratio of male to female heroes is a real bummer for me in a series that I by and large love otherwise. I really hope that this changes with Izuku&rsquo;s generation and Momo or Ochako (or Mina! or Tsuyu! or Kendou! there are so many cool girls) make it into the top 3</li><li>lastly, I&rsquo;m kind of surprised that his actual name is still apparently a secret. is it going to be some big reveal or something? or maybe Horikoshi just hasn&rsquo;t settled on one yet, given how much thought he typically puts into names, and how complex a character he is. but I&rsquo;m curious now dammit</li></ul></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nAizawa adopted Eri, basically, and she&rsquo;s going to be living in U.A. for the\ntime being with Mirio helping to look after her. The Pussycats (and Kouta!!)\npaid a visit to the 1-A dorms. Kouta had red Deku shoes and I died of cute. We learned about the JP Hero\nBillboard Chart, which updates its rankings twice a year. We then cut to the\nlive event, where the top 10 heroes came out on stage and the new rankings were\nmade official. There were not nearly enough ladies in the rankings, which is\nsome bullshit, but tbh that&rsquo;s a problem with superhero media in\ngeneral, so BnHA isn&rsquo;t exactly an outlier in this respect. Anyway, we met some\nnew heroes like Old Man Samurai and Literally A Washing Machine, and found out\nthat Kamui Woods had actually cracked the top 10, taking the #7 spot. My denim\nboi Supreme Best Jeanist moved up to number three, and we <i>finally</i> learned the identity of the former #3 and now #2 hero,\nHawks. And of course Endeavor is now the official #1, and to celebrate he got a\nnew costume. Hooray I guess.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA: </b>The newly ranked top ten heroes share their comments with the crowd. Most of them are subdued, aware of the weight that&rsquo;s fallen on their collective shoulders in the wake of All Might&rsquo;s retirement. Finally Hawks gets fed up and drags the others for giving bland and&nbsp;&ldquo;safe&rdquo; answers during such a tumultuous time when the world is looking for more from the heroes they have left. We learn that Hawks, who is only 22, is basically a prodigy and the youngest hero ever to make the top ten. Having said his piece, he hands the mic to Endeavor, who simply says&nbsp;&ldquo;watch me&rdquo; and leaves it at that. Later on backstage, Endeavor confronts Hawks about putting him on the spot. Hawks confesses that he was trying to help him, and that with All Might gone the world needs a new iconic figure who can help put them at ease. He thinks Endeavor fits the bill. And also he wants to request a team-up with him regarding the Noumus! Remember them? Well speaking of, the chapter ends with a cut to an unknown location where a shadowy figure is speaking to a new&nbsp;&ldquo;High End&rdquo; Noumu who can <i>fucking talk</i>. So yeah. That&rsquo;s a thing now.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter. I&rsquo;ve read up through chapter 207 now, so any ETAs will reflect that.)</p>\n</p>",
