How his heart hadn\u2019t yet fallen out of his ass from the sheer power of emotion, Dan wasn\u2019t sure. Phil was literally Dan\u2019s ideal man. And Phil had agreed to go on a date with him. As excited as Dan was, he was equally filled with anxiety at everything that could go wrong.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t fuck it up, Dan</i>.</p><p>On the drive over to Phil\u2019s house, Dan worried that he had somehow gotten the wrong address, or that his phone\u2019s GPS had sent him the wrong way, or that he\u2019d be late to pick Phil up, or that Phil would have already left his house and moved back to England.</p><p>It was ridiculous, honestly, but Dan couldn\u2019t help it. He <i>really</i> wanted this date to work out.</p><p>Every red light added to his stress. He kept glancing at the little clock in his car, watching the minutes pass. He was supposed to pick Phil up at 7am sharp, but the time ticked closer and closer, and Dan felt like he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere closer to Phil\u2019s house anytime soon. His nerves grew with every second that passed, and he found himself chewing on his lip in anticipation. He had done his best to leave his house with time to spare, but now that he was actually en route, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d made it out the door in time. </p><p><i>He\u2019ll be so disappointed if I\u2019m late. Dan the Fuck-Up, as usual, can\u2019t even be bothered to make it to a date on time. Classic- </i></p><p>\u201cArrived,\u201d said the mechanical voice on Dan\u2019s phone, interrupting Dan\u2019s spiral of thoughts. </p><p>Dan pulled over in front of a small house. It looked like it might have been white, but Dan couldn\u2019t be sure in the faint early morning light.</p><p>He anxiously checked the clock again. It was 7:06.</p><p><i>Bloody typical.</i></p><p>Phil had told Dan to text when he arrived, saying it would be easier than knocking on the door and waking up Phil\u2019s housemates and suffering their persistent teasing. Dan didn\u2019t waste any time grabbing his phone from the passenger\u2019s seat and texting Phil. He didn\u2019t want Phil to have to wait any longer than he already had.</p><p><b>Dan:</b> im here</p><p>Phil\u2019s response came within seconds, startling Dan.</p><p><i>He responded so fast, he must have been waiting. Dammit, Dan, why are you always late?! He\u2019s probably mad about it.</i></p><p>He took a deep breath and opened the message.</p><p><b>Phil:<i> </i></b>gr8 gimme 2 secs i\u2019ll b right there</p><p>Dan let out the breath he had been holding. Phil wasn\u2019t mad. At least, Dan assumed so, since Phil said he was coming. </p><p>Nervously, Dan\u2019s hands began dancing and tapping randomly on the steering wheel of his car.  </p><p><i>He\u2019s coming. Oh my god, the date is about to start. Oh my god. </i></p><p>He looked outside the window, anxiously watching the door of the house- but then he looked away to look at the road because watching the door meant actively waiting for Phil to exit his house, which was stressful in itself because it made him think about how much time was passing and how much time Phil had to change his mind and decide not to come on the date after all.</p><p><i>This date has to be </i>perfect<i>. If it\u2019s not perfect, he won\u2019t want to go on another date and you\u2019ll end up alone and sad. </i></p><p>Dan noticed his leg was bouncing erratically from the nerves and forced himself to take a breath.</p><p><i>It\u2019ll be okay. He wanted to go with you this time, so he clearly must like </i>something<i> about you. Just chill out.</i></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the house opened and Phil stepped out, turning and locking it behind him.</p><p>The nerves struck Dan again as Phil approached, manifesting in even more intense finger tapping. Phil\u2019s hair was quiffed up off his forehead, and Dan ached to run his fingers through it. He wore a red plaid shirt, well-fitted to his broad shoulders and making his biceps pop. His black skinny jeans had rips in the knees, giving him a bit of an edgy aesthetic that Dan knew didn\u2019t reflect Phil\u2019s true nerdy, kind personality. Dan was intimidated as hell by Phil\u2019s appearance. How could he look so put-together this early in the morning?? It literally was not fair, and Dan felt inadequate in his own ripped black skinny jeans and cherry blossom button-up. His leg started to vibrate again, and he rolled his eyes at himself.</p><p><i>Get it together, Dan</i>.</p><p>They made eye contact through the windscreen, and Phil flashed Dan one of his absolutely <i>adorable</i> smiles. Dan\u2019s heartbeat picked up even more at the sight, and he managed a small smile in return.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so perfect.</i></p><p>Phil arrived at the passenger door and pulled the handle. The door didn\u2019t open. Phil shot Dan a confused look through the window. His brows were furrowed, and there was a cute little wrinkle in the middle of his forehead. Phil pulled the handle again, then pouted up at Dan. His bottom lip was sticking out, and his eyebrows were lifting.</p><p><i>What? Why isn\u2019t it ope-</i> <i>Oh.</i></p><p>Dan sheepishly flipped the \u201cunlock\u201d switch on the control panel next to his arm, then motioned for Phil to try again. This time, it worked, and Phil slid into the seat with a cheeky smile. </p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were excited for this date,\u201d Phil teased lightheartedly.</p><p><i>Shit! Now he thinks I don\u2019t want this!</i></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Dan exclaimed loudly, eyes wide and hands reaching out as if to grab Phil\u2019s arm and keep him in the car.</p><p>Phil blinked, tilting his head to the side and furrowing his brow. Clearly, Dan had confused him again. </p><p>Dan winced at his own unending awkwardness, then backpedaled to try to salvage the conversation that had <i>barely even begun, god, get it together, Dan</i>. </p><p>\u201cI am <i>really</i> excited for this date, Phil, you have no idea,\u201d he began, refusing to look at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m just also really nervous-\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s giggle interrupted the beginnings of a rant that surely would make Dan feel much worse. \u201cI\u2019m kidding! I know you\u2019re excited,\u201d Phil laughed. </p><p>The fondness in Phil\u2019s voice caused Dan to cautiously look at Phil out of the corner of his eye. </p><p>Sure enough, the fondest of smiles graced Phil\u2019s lips. Dan could feel himself blushing, and he hoped Phil wouldn\u2019t notice (but he was sure the color on his cheeks was glaringly obvious). </p><p>Slowly, Phil reached a tentative hand out to one of Dan\u2019s, gently prying his white-knuckled grasp off the steering wheel to intertwine their fingers. Dan stared at their linked hands in wonder. Phil\u2019s hand was a little smaller and a lot paler, but it looked perfect in Dan\u2019s. Dan felt a clammy warmth coming from Phil\u2019s palm, and he relaxed a little when he realized that must mean that Phil wasn\u2019t feeling as confident as he seemed- at least Dan wasn\u2019t alone in his nerves. </p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s okay that you\u2019re nervous. I\u2019m nervous, too.\u201d Phil leaned in closer to Dan to whisper conspiratorially, \u201cPlus, you\u2019re really cute when you blush.\u201d</p><p>Dan figured that Phil would probably think Dan was \u201creally cute\u201d most of the date, then, because he couldn\u2019t seem to get his cheeks to calm down. If anything, he was pretty sure his cheeks were getting even more red.</p><p>Flustered, Dan didn\u2019t know what to say in response, so he just looked back at the road, shaking his head in slight disbelief.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t know how he could think I\u2019m cute when he\u2019s obviously the cutest person in the universe</i>.</p><p>Dan swallowed nervously. \u201cWe should- uh- get going. The whole point of getting up before daylight was to get there early, right?\u201d Dan said, deciding to ignore Phil\u2019s comment entirely. </p><p>Phil shrugged and leaned back in his seat, releasing Dan\u2019s hand so he could drive.</p><p>He carefully checked that the road was clear before pulling into the lane.</p><p>Although his eyes were trained on the street, Dan could practically <i>feel</i> Phil\u2019s self-satisfied grin. He couldn\u2019t help the blush that just wouldn\u2019t go away, not when he knew Phil was smiling because of him. </p><p><i>That cute bitch. God, I\u2019m a mess.</i></p><p>Phil must have sensed Dan\u2019s current inability to converse like a proper human being, and decided to take pity on him because he took charge of the conversation. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved Disney.\u201d Phil said thoughtfully. \u201cI was definitely that kid who sat inside all day rewatching <i>The Lion King</i> until my parents couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d He chuckled at himself, then continued. \u201cI think they eventually broke the tape on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Dan pictured it - a tiny Phil sat in front of a shitty \u201890s television, dressed in absolutely horrendous \u201890s fashion, and singing along at the top of his lungs. He was probably dreadfully off-key even then. </p><p>He laughed at the mental image, glancing over at Phil as if trying to picture this adult man in the same situation. \u201cThat sounds cute as fuck, Phil,\u201d he said through the laugh.</p><p>\u201cDoes it really?\u201d Phil asked, sounding surprised. \u201dSeems a bit annoying, if you ask me. My parents certainly thought so,\u201d Phil mused.</p><p>Dan shook his head, and snuck another glance at Phil. </p><p>\u201cDefinitely cute as fuck,\u201d Dan adamantly assured Phil. He was almost offended that anyone could be annoyed with Phil. \u201cAnd you know what, <i>The Lion King </i>is amazing, so we are gonna sing it right now, on the way to Disney, because we are adults and no one can stop us,\u201d he declared.</p><p><i>Shit, what if he doesn\u2019t want to, though?</i></p><p>Dan quickly side-eyed Phil, saying, \u201cYou know, if you want, that is. We don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>But Dan\u2019s concern was unnecessary, as Phil was already grinning and pulling out his phone to find the soundtrack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it now, Howell. The offer has been made and there\u2019s no going back,\u201d Phil said just as \u201cThe Circle of Life\u201d began to play from his phone.</p><p>\u201cNaaaaaaans lasagna baby itsy baby!\u201d Phil sang along loudly. He was extremely pitchy, but he didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i>, Phil!\u201d Dan yelled through a hyena laugh. \u201cThose <i>so</i> aren\u2019t the lyrics, oh my <i>god</i>!\u201d </p><p>Phil ignored him and continued to sing, moving to the background chorus \u201clyrics\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama. It\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama.\u201d </p><p>Dan laughed harder, doing his best to keep his attention primarily focused on the road. </p><p><i>He\u2019s having so much fun with this. I bet it\u2019d make him happy if I sing like that, too.</i></p><p>Dan would do pretty much anything to make Phil smile, so he joined in, singing, \u201cIt\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama\u201d just as loudly and carelessly as Phil.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Dan could see Phil turn his head to look at him. Dan felt himself absolutely <i>melting</i> under the fond giddiness in Phil\u2019s gaze.</p><p><i>Today\u2019s gonna be such a good day.</i></p><p>They spent a majority of the drive singing along to various Disney songs, sticking to <i>The Lion King</i> at first but expanding to some of their other Disney favorites like <i>Mulan </i>(Dan loved singing his dramatic rendition of \u201cReflection\u201d) and <i>The Little Mermaid </i>(they couldn\u2019t <i>not</i>. Phil was Prince Eric, after all). </p><p>\u201cSo, I told you what my favorite Disney movie growing up was, now it\u2019s your turn,\u201d Phil began as the last note of \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d faded away. \u201cWhat did your poor parents have to put up with?\u201d</p><p>Dan blushed, his eyes darting over to glance at Phil. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>Phil scoffed. \u201cImpossible. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s perfectly endearing.\u201d Dan shook his head but Phil continued, sounding almost petulant. \u201cEither way, you have to tell me because I already told you mine.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but gave in. Phil could probably make him give into anything. \u201cOkay, fine. My favorite Disney cartoon was Winnie the Pooh. It\u2019s lit<i>-tra-</i>ly why I have such a posh accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwwwww, I love Winnie the Pooh!\u201d Phil cooed. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t my favorite, but he was so wonderful.\u201d </p><p>Dan glanced over, surprised by Phil\u2019s enthusiastic reaction. Phil was already staring back at him with a small, fond smile.</p><p>Just as Dan was about to speak up, maybe change the subject because he still felt a bit embarrassed, Phil spoke again. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not all that surprised your favorite was Winnie the Pooh. You kind of remind me of him, in a way,\u201d he said thoughtfully. </p><p>Dan smiled, but couldn\u2019t keep the confusion out of his expression, his head tilting to the side slightly and his eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>\u201cI really remind you of Winnie the Pooh?\u201d Dan asked, baffled.</p><p>In his peripheral vision, Dan caught a glimpse of Phil. Phil was staring out the window like he was deep in thought, scrunching up his eyebrows slightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this kind of calm chillness about you, but I still know you\u2019ll work hard to get what you want. Like, you work for what you care about but still take it easy every now and then, if that makes sense. And you seem to care a lot about your friends, which is very Pooh.\u201d </p><p>There was a thoughtfulness and sincerity to his voice that caught Dan off guard. <i>How does he know that about me already? Does he really pay that much attention?</i> Warmth filled Dan as he considered that maybe Phil liked him as much as he liked Phil.</p><p>But then Phil grinned, continuing cheekily, \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure what you want usually isn\u2019t a pot of honey.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a snort. \u201c<i>Most</i> of that was actually very perceptive of you,\u201d he replied fondly, glancing over at Phil with a soft smile. </p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cNo, not really. It\u2019s not that hard to recognize that you\u2019ve never taken a pot of honey to work,\u201d he tried to say casually, but he couldn\u2019t quite keep the amusement from his voice.</p><p>Dan groaned and rolled his eyes, but he laughed affectionately. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dork!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s a dork!\u201d Phil retorted in a faux-defensive tone.</p><p>\u201cOi, you leave my mum out of this!\u201d Dan laughed, reaching over to poke Phil\u2019s leg.</p><p>The conversation dissolved into laughter and more meaningless, but fun, banter. Dan lost track of the time, his brain in autopilot as he drove them the rest of the way to Disney, and he found himself almost sad when they arrived. The drive had gone so well, what if things got awkward when they were wandering around?</p><p>Dan\u2019s worry didn\u2019t last long, however, as Phil continued to talk just as he had in the car. As they walked into the park, they made a quick list of rides they <i>had</i> to go on, and then they were off.</p><p>Creepy dolls sang \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d to them (Phil regretted that suggestion; he told Dan he definitely gave himself nightmare material for weeks), they journeyed through the Caribbean with cunning pirates to find Spanish gold, and they took a tour through Neverland. Each ride had a long enough line that they could talk for a short while, but they didn\u2019t feel like they were wasting the day just waiting around.</p><p>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was definitely Phil\u2019s favorite. He made Dan go on it three times in a row. And because Phil just looked too adorable when he was excited (his eyes lit up as he smiled and bounced on the balls of his feet, insisting they had to <i>go go go again right now, it\u2019s so fun!</i>), Dan couldn\u2019t say no. Plus, it was kind of a small cart and they were rather tall. Dan wasn\u2019t about to give up the chance to be squished into Phil\u2019s side.</p><p>They wandered into Liberty Square for lunch. Dan had timed it perfectly, because it was just before a parade was supposed to begin. He thought Phil might enjoy seeing the characters and hearing the music as a guest rather than an employee for once, since he was always so excited about the magic of Disney. Dan <i>loved</i> it when the magic would excite Phil; Phil\u2019s inner child would shine through, lighting up his face and making him giggle in wonder.</p><p>\u201cWe <i>have</i> to go to Sleepy Hollow,\u201d Dan insisted as he pointed to the restaurant with one hand, excitedly tapping Phil\u2019s arm with his other. \u201cThey have the best damn chicken and waffles you will ever have in your life, and there\u2019s a little picnic area so we can watch the parade go by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a pancakes man, to be honest,\u201d Phil said dubiously. \u201cBut I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d He flashed Dan a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cThese are so much more than a breakfast food, Phil, they are <i>art</i>. They make sandwiches out of the waffle and put this spicy chicken inside and-\u201d Dan moaned theatrically- \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, it\u2019s just <i>so good</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, lead the way!\u201d Phil conceded, and gestured for Dan to go ahead of him. Dan reached behind him and pulled Phil after him by the forearm as he hurriedly made his way into the restaurant.</p><p>Phil let Dan pick his waffle for him, and then took out his wallet to pay.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, put that away!\u201d Dan insisted, pushing Phil\u2019s arm down. \u201cI asked you out, so I\u2019m paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d Phil started, his hand still reaching into his wallet.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Dan lightly hip-checked Phil out of the way and handed his card over to the cashier. \u201cI\u2019ve got this, okay?\u201d He turned to look at Phil again to see him rolling his eyes, which worried him until he noticed Phil\u2019s small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous, but okay.\u201d Phil gave Dan\u2019s shoulder a mini shove to retaliate for the hip-check.</p><p>A few minutes later, they retrieved the waffles and sat down at a table near the edge of the patio so they could see the parade when it came.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for your life to change dramatically?\u201d Dan asked seriously as they each picked up their waffle sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019m a little scared. That\u2019s a lot of pressure riding on this one sandwich,\u201d Phil teased. He eyed the sandwich skeptically, eyes narrowed in distrust.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s deserved, believe me,\u201d Dan said. \u201cCome on, then. I\u2019m waiting for your reaction.\u201d Dan leaned in closer and stared at Phil eagerly, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil eyed his sandwich with a curious expression - part wary and part excited - before he leaned in, opened his mouth wide, and took a big bite. </p><p>He seemed to consider for a moment, and then his eyes widened comically. He looked at Dan with pure wonder on his face. His lips were tilting up into a smile, even though his mouth was full of food.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan said, nodding seriously.</p><p>\u201cHow - it\u2019s - oh my god,\u201d Phil groaned around his bite of food.</p><p>\u201cI <i>know</i>,\u201d Dan laughed. He leaned back in his seat, relieved at Phil\u2019s reaction. \u201cYou like it, then?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded vigorously, already going in for another bite.</p><p>Dan laughed again, then took a bite of his own sandwich and moaned at the flavor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really spicy but it\u2019s so good,\u201d Phil managed when he finally swallowed. He chugged a few gulps of water, then dove back into the sandwich.</p><p>Dan felt a strange sense of pride well up in him. Phil had trusted Dan\u2019s suggestion and it paid off <i>brilliantly</i>. </p><p>Just then, the front of the parade passed by their seating area. The magic of seeing the characters wasn\u2019t as strong for Dan or Phil now that they\u2019ve done parades and meet and greets before, but that didn\u2019t stop them from enjoying it. Mickey Mouse waved at them, and Phil squealed in delight.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mickey!\u201d he called excitedly, bouncing in his seat a bit and waving his arm wildly.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so precious, oh my god</i>.</p><p>\u201cMickey Mouse waved at me, Dan! I feel special,\u201d Phil exclaimed, looking at Dan with the gleeful excitement of a child.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Dan said softly. His body was frozen, his hands half-raised to his mouth with the last few bites of his waffle sandwich, but his eyes wandered Phil\u2019s face, taking in the joy and giddiness. Phil\u2019s happiness was infectious, and Dan found himself smiling affectionately at this excitable man who had somehow agreed to go on a date with <i>Dan</i>, of all people.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face flushed, and he broke eye contact for a moment to look down at his food tray, then cautiously looked back up at Dan through his lashes. Dan felt a fresh surge of affection as he saw how bashful Phil got at the compliment. </p><p>They stared at each other silently for a moment, faces turning redder by the second, until Dan cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, you liked the waffle, then?\u201d He pointed at the sticky mess left on the tray where Phil\u2019s sandwich used to be.</p><p>Phil nodded. \u201cLife-changing, as advertised. Thanks for the suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it,\u201d Dan replied. He cleared his throat again. \u201cSo, after the parade crowd clears out a bit, do you wanna go to the Haunted Mansion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Phil agreed. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the crowd to disperse once the parade ended, and then Dan and Phil were off to find the Haunted Mansion.</p><p>On the way, they encountered a traffic jam where some families were apparently meeting a character. A huge crowd of people stood in the way, blocking the whole path. Dan felt a twinge of sympathy for the handler, knowing how hard it could be to keep a crowd under control, especially in walkways. As a handler, he hated when people tried to force their way through, but he was a man on a mission. He\u2019d just try not to be too aggressive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go for it,\u201d Dan decided, already sending mental apologies to the handler. \u201cStay close?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded, and Dan pushed himself into the small gaps between people with Phil on his heels.</p><p>Except Phil wasn\u2019t quite as on-his-heels as he expected. Dan had moved a little too fast for Phil to keep up in such a cramped space. A hand grasped onto Dan\u2019s wrist, and he jumped, glancing back quickly to see Phil\u2019s arm outstretched. </p><p><i>Phil\u2019s basically holding my hand. It\u2019s fine, nothing to worry about. Totally cool over here. It\u2019s all good.</i></p><p>They finally broke free of the crowd and could stand next to each other again. Dan expected Phil to drop his wrist now that they had room to maneuver, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, Phil\u2019s hand slid down to lace their fingers together.</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart beat faster, and he stared down at their clasped hands. <i>Be cool, Dan, he\u2019s just holding your hand.</i></p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Phil asked tentatively.</p><p>Dan\u2019s head snapped up to make eye contact. Phil was blushing and looked like he was making a concerted effort not to hide his face.</p><p>\u201cHm? The hands? Yes, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s - it\u2019s great. Perfect, really.\u201d Dan fumbled, flustered.</p><p><i>I said be cool, that is </i>not<i> being cool</i>.</p><p>Phil\u2019s free hand rose up to cover his mouth slightly, trying to hide a giggle, but the crows feet around his eyes gave him away.</p><p>\u201cNooooo, don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d Dan whined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil said through his laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re just too adorable.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks were definitely bright red by now. \u201cShut up,\u201d he grumbled. He stuck out his bottom lip in an exaggerated pout. </p><p>\u201cAwwww,\u201d Phil cooed. \u201cYou\u2019re really not making me think you\u2019re less adorable, if that was the goal.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out an exaggerated huff and walked slightly ahead of Phil - just far enough ahead to keep up his dramatic charade, but close enough that they could still hold hands.</p><p>They arrived at the Haunted Mansion line and worked their way to the front. Along the way, Dan and Phil took turns reading out all of the silly tombstones of the dead residents. Every so often, Phil would laugh at one of the funny ways of dying and say, \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d </p><p>On the ride itself, Dan cozied up to Phil as much as he dare. The seats were much bigger than Big Thunder Railroad and he - unfortunately - didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to squish into Phil\u2019s side in order to fit. He didn\u2019t want to drape himself all over Phil, but he wanted to be as close as was reasonably possible, so he settled for sitting close enough that their sides touched from shoulder to knee.</p><p><i>Is this too much? Is he uncomfortable? Oh, god, this was a mistake, wasn\u2019t it.</i></p><p>But then Phil\u2019s foot bumped Dan\u2019s, nudging it gently before hooking his ankle around Dan\u2019s.</p><p>Dan looked at Phil, happy to know that apparently Phil wanted to be close just as much as Dan, but Phil was steadfastly observing the other side of their cart. Dan rolled his eyes fondly and relaxed into the chair.</p><p>Their cart turned a corner, and the ride properly began. </p><p>Some of the spooks startled Phil throughout the ride, and Dan laughed at him for it.</p><p>\u201cReally, Phil? How didn\u2019t you expect that to pop up?\u201d Dan would tease, squeezing Phil\u2019s hand briefly.</p><p>\u201cShhhh, I just wasn\u2019t paying enough attention!\u201d Phil would reply, squeezing right back.</p><p>About halfway through the ride, the cart spun around and began descending a sharp hill backwards. Gravity squished Dan and Phil to the middle of the seat, right up against each other.</p><p>Dan breathed in sharply as their bodies pressed together even more than they already had been, and he quickly looked over at Phil\u2019s face. Phil was already looking at him, blushing heavily.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil whispered shyly. He flexed his fingers around Dan\u2019s before squeezing gently.</p><p>Equally shyly, Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>When the cart straightened out, neither of them made any effort to readjust to sit farther away from the other. Dan felt his heart soar when he realized that meant Phil wanted to be close to him, too.</p><p>Not long after, the ride came to an end. Phil let go of Dan\u2019s hand to climb out of the cart, then reached back to offer his hand as a support as Dan followed.</p><p>\u201cHow gentlemanly,\u201d Dan commented with a slight quirk of his lips. Inside, he was gushing about how sweet Phil was and how much he loved the feeling of the soft skin of Phil\u2019s hand against his own. He worried Phil would let go of his hand as soon as he got off the ride, but Phil only adjusted his grip to interlock their fingers again. He brushed his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles, and butterflies erupted in Dan\u2019s stomach.</p><p>As they left the Haunted Mansion set, they debated where to go next.</p><p>Phil\u2019s vote was the Winnie the Pooh ride.</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s such a cute one! Besides, you said you loved Pooh!\u201d Phil eagerly suggested.</p><p>Dan laughed and let Phil pull him across the park to the ride.</p><p><i>He wants to make me happy so much. I\u2019m supposed to be making sure we go on rides </i>he<i> likes but he\u2019s over here pushing me to do something for personal nostalgia\u2019s sake. He\u2019s so sweet.</i></p><p>Fortunately, the line wasn\u2019t too long, so they passed through the interactive buttons and animatronics until they made it to the carts. </p><p>They had to drop their hands to climb into the carts, much to Dan\u2019s annoyance, but he relaxed when Phil sat down probably closer than was strictly necessary.</p><p>Phil leaned in to whisper in Dan\u2019s ear, \u201cWill you hold my hand if I get scared?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a loud laugh, turning his head to look at Phil.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Winnie the Pooh, so I doubt that\u2019ll be a problem.\u201d His hand found Phil\u2019s anyway as the ride began to move, already desperate for the comforting warmth and the accompanying rush of giddy excitement that Dan was beginning to associate with holding Phil\u2019s hand. Dan felt a grin breaking out on his face, playing it off as excitement for Winnie the Pooh. He looked around at the walls, quickly reading the giant storybook page that set up the story for the ride.</p><p>Just before they entered the ride, Dan looked back at Phil with a soft smile and quietly admitted, \u201cI like holding your hand, even if you aren\u2019t scared.\u201d</p><p>Phil bit his lip around a giddy smile, and Dan\u2019s heart just about melted at the sight.</p><p>\u201cOi, you\u2019ll miss the ride if you keep looking at me,\u201d Phil complained, nudging Dan\u2019s elbow with his own.</p><p>\u201cMmm, but I really like looking at you. Especially when I get you to blush like that,\u201d Dan teased, nudging Phil\u2019s shoulder playfully. He relented, though, deciding to enjoy the ride as Phil insisted.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly thrilling ride, by any means. There were a few jerky turns and wobbles, but no dips or spins, and the pace was fairly slow. They both giggled as the ride bounced up and down, mimicking Tigger\u2019s bouncing.</p><p>Dan loved it anyway, partly because of the nostalgia of Winnie the Pooh and partly because of how into it Phil was. He never was <i>actually</i> scared, but he pretended to be when they came to the section of Heffalumps and Woozles, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand harder and bringing his other arm to hug Dan\u2019s. Phil\u2019s head came to rest on Dan\u2019s shoulder, and Dan went perfectly still.</p><p><i>Oh my god. He\u2019s so precious. Don\u2019t move, Dan, or he\u2019ll move</i>.</p><p>Luckily, it seemed that Phil had no intention of moving away from Dan for the rest of the ride. He stayed snuggled up to Dan\u2019s arm for the last few minutes of the story, then reluctantly detached himself as their cart came to the end. </p><p>\u201cThat was a great idea, Phil. I\u2019m glad you dragged me over here,\u201d Dan said happily as they exited the track area. He couldn\u2019t get the dopey smile off his face.</p><p>Phil gasped, ignoring Dan entirely in favor of pointing to the alcove next to the ride and tugging on their still-clasped hands. </p><p>\u201cLook! Tigger and Pooh are there for photos!\u201d He turned to Dan, expression extremely serious. \u201cWe have to go get pictures with them.\u201d</p><p>Dan was on the verge of saying no. They most likely knew whoever it was in the costumes, so some of the magic was already missing from the experience. Besides, it would <i>definitely</i> be weird if two awkwardly tall adult men got in line to meet <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>.</p><p>But Phil looked so excited and happy, Dan couldn\u2019t find it in himself to decline. Instead, he sighed in mock exasperation and gestured for Phil to lead the way.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face lit up even more, making Dan smile and shake his head fondly. </p><p><i>He\u2019s such a dork. I love that he\u2019s so willing to let himself be a kid at Disney. He really makes the magic come to life.</i></p><p>The line to meet Pooh and Tigger was significantly longer than the line for the ride had been, so they occupied their time by sharing anecdotes about their childhood experiences. Phil had several stories about the crazy things he did or believed as a kid, like how he thought the \u201cD\u201d in the Disney logo was actually a \u201cG\u201d or how crowds cheering at football matches scared him to the point of tears.</p><p>(Dan, of course, found this very endearing and jokingly promised he would never cheer at a football match in front of Phil.)</p><p>In exchange, Dan told Phil a few stories about some of his more embarrassing failures and awkward moments growing up, like how he got fired from his last job for selling an axe to a twelve-year-old. </p><p>Finally, they made it to the front of the line and got to meet Tigger and Pooh. They each got to hug both characters, much to Phil\u2019s delight. Before they took the picture, they also got to \u201ctalk\u201d with the animals. Neither character could actually say anything, but Tigger had some <i>very</i> articulate gestures.</p><p>He looked at Dan, then pointed back and forth between Dan and Phil, who was having an animated conversation with Pooh and completely unaware of the attention. Dan wasn\u2019t entirely sure, but he thought maybe Tigger had caught on to their affection. Sure enough, Tigger placed both hands over his heart and tilted his head.</p><p>Blushing, Dan laughed. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re here on a date,\u201d he confirmed in a low voice, trying not to attract Phil\u2019s attention away from where he talked with Pooh. It wasn\u2019t that the date was a secret, Dan just felt a little self-conscious that he was talking to one of his childhood idols - and probably coworkers, honestly - about a <i>date</i>.</p><p>Tigger gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up - or at least the closest thing he could get to a thumbs up in his costume. He took Dan\u2019s hand to guide him to Phil, made them hold hands, then moved to stand on the other side of Phil. Pooh stood next to Dan, and they were ready for pictures.</p><p>Dan and Phil both blushed profusely at Tigger\u2019s antics, even though they\u2019d already been holding hands all day. It was just a different experience when someone else noticed their feelings and nudged them together, showing Dan that maybe they <i>did</i> work well together. Plus, Dan realized that he was about to actually take a picture while <i>holding hands with Phil</i>, which would immortalize this perfect moment.</p><p>They took a few nice pictures with Pooh and Tigger, then bade them goodbye and left the meeting spot, still hand-in-hand.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing! Tigger saw right through us, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Phil chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHe definitely did,\u201d Dan agreed. He swung their clasped hands around slightly, enjoying the sensation of the contact. Casually, he added, \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s anybody we know today\u2026 We\u2019ll <i>definitely</i> be hearing about this at work later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh!\u201d Phil clapped a hand over Dan\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s <i>Tigger</i>, not somebody we know!\u201d he scolded, shaking his head in mock disappointment.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and smiled under Phil\u2019s hand. \u201cOf course, how could I ever forget,\u201d he deadpanned, though it came out warbled and muffled.</p><p>Phil narrowed his eyes at Dan suspiciously, then nodded once. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you said, but I\u2019ll take it as an apology. No more ruining the magic, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed dramatically, then nodded. </p><p>Letting out a satisfied hum, Phil dropped his hand from Dan\u2019s mouth and looking around at their surroundings. His eyes landed on the gift shop for Winnie the Pooh, and he immediately started pulling Dan towards it. \u201cI just had the best idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like where you\u2019re going with this, love, the look on your face screams mischief,\u201d Dan said warily.</p><p><i>Did I just call him \u201clove\u201d? Oh shit, it is definitely too soon for pet names like that. Shit, that was too much.</i></p><p>But Phil didn\u2019t comment on it. If anything, his smile got wider as he mercilessly tugged Dan along. </p><p>\u201cShh, trust me! This will be amazing, I promise.\u201d Phil sounded particularly excited about this idea of his. </p><p>When they entered the shop, Phil made straight for the back wall. He let go of Dan\u2019s hand to pick up two Mickey Mouse ear hats, one Tigger and one Pooh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m buying these and we\u2019ll match for the rest of the day,\u201d Phil declared adamantly, sounding like he\u2019d already made up his mind.</p><p>Dan blinked in shock, glancing quickly from Phil to the hats and back again. \u201cUm, what? Phil, those are, like, $30 each. I can\u2019t let you get them for both of us on a date I asked you to, that would be ungentlemanly!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>Phil giggled. \u201cYou think I care about that? You\u2019ve already been such a gentleman so far. You bought lunch and everything! Besides, <i>I</i> want to get them. It was my idea, anyway, it\u2019s only right I pay for them. Plus, you\u2019re forgetting that we get a cast member discount, silly. Come on, please?\u201d Phil stuck out his bottom lip and opened his eyes wider in a puppy pout. </p><p>Dan hesitated, momentarily distracted by how endearing that expression was, before contemplating the issue at hand. He didn\u2019t want to push it too much and make it seem like he thought Phil couldn\u2019t afford the hats or something, but he also didn\u2019t want to make Phil pay for them. </p><p><i>Although, he\u2019s right - it was his idea. Surely he wouldn\u2019t have suggested it if he wasn\u2019t willing and expecting to pay for them\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d Dan relented. \u201cYou can buy us the hats, but I\u2019m buying dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already paid for lunch, though!\u201d Phil exclaimed with a tone. \u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to treat you,\u201d Dan mumbled sheepishly, tugging gently on Phil\u2019s hand. He looked up at Phil through his lashes as he continued, \u201cI want you to feel special today, you know? This should all be about you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s free hand reached up and brushed some of Phil\u2019s drooping quiff off his forehead, eventually resting his hand on Phil\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Phil nuzzled into Dan\u2019s hand slightly, looking a little conflicted for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, alright then, if you insist. You can pay for dinner later. But right now, I\u2019m going to get these hats and make everyone jealous of our relationship,\u201d Phil announced with a flare.</p><p><i>Relationship? Does that mean he wants to be boyfriends? Is it too early for that? I mean\u2026 I think I want that, but does he? I know we\u2019re still only on the first date, but this feels so </i>natural<i> that it would just make sense to make it official, wouldn\u2019t it? </i></p><p>Dan decided to tuck the questions away for now, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat as he followed closely behind Phil to the registers.</p><p>Phil quickly paid and picked up the hats from the counter, turning to face Dan.</p><p>\u201cAlright, then, let\u2019s see it on you. May I?\u201d Phil asked, gesturing towards Dan\u2019s head with the Pooh hat and smiling.</p><p><i>My hair is going to hate this\u2026</i></p><p>Dan leaned forward in answer, presenting his head for Phil. Phil slowly fixed the hat over Dan\u2019s head, placing the chin strap under his chin to secure it in place. He reached up and messed with his hair, carefully pulling out a few strands from under the hat. Usually, Dan wouldn\u2019t let anyone fix his hair for him because he alone knew how to make it look good, but he didn\u2019t complain as Phil fluffed the exposed ends. Somehow, he felt like he could trust Phil to do it right. After a lingering moment, Phil pulled his hands away, and Dan tilted his head back up so Phil could inspect the results.</p><p>He inhaled sharply and stared at Dan with an unreadable expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Does it look weird?\u201d Dan asked, suddenly nervous. He took out his phone to use the camera as a mirror. </p><p>It actually wasn\u2019t too bad; his hair was definitely more of a mess now, but he actually looked fairly good with the hat.</p><p>Dan looked back up to see Phil still staring at him, now with a beaming smile.</p><p>Dan blushed at the attention, and Phil cooed.</p><p>\u201cI knew this would be a good idea. You look fantastic,\u201d Phil assured Dan, reaching up a hand again and gently brushing his fingers through the visible floof of hair poking out from under the hat. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan mumbled, feeling the blush continue to burn on his cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiled brightly at him, then dropped his hand from Dan\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Phil thrust the Tigger hat towards Dan\u2019s hand, then tilted his head down so Dan could put the hat on him.</p><p>Dan stretched the elastic over Phil\u2019s chin and pushed the hat back onto Phil\u2019s head. He brushed his fingers through Phil\u2019s quiff to make sure his hair wouldn\u2019t look weird, marvelling at the softness for a moment, then removed his hands.</p><p>Phil\u2019s head tilted back up, and he was grinning, and his face was <i>so close</i> to Dan\u2019s that, for a moment, Dan\u2019s brain short-circuited.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil giggled.</p><p>The giggle was enough to pull Dan\u2019s brain back together in a flurry of thoughts.</p><p><i>Great, my cheeks are going to be permanently pink around Phil, apparently</i>.<i> It doesn\u2019t help that he looks unfairly pretty in that Tigger hat with his stupid gorgeous quiff poking out just a little and he looks so excited and happy and wait what did he say again? Was I supposed to respond? Oh yeah -</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Dan awkwardly said a few beats too late.</p><p>Phil giggled again, not seeming to care about Dan\u2019s awkwardness, then reached into his pocket for his phone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a selfie, immortalize the moment,\u201d Phil suggested.</p><p><i>Oh my god, yes. We are too cute, and I need a picture of Phil looking like this so I can look back on this moment and absolutely melt. He looks so happy.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it, if you want. I\u2019ve mastered the perfect selfie angle with my noodle arms,\u201d Dan joked, stepping closer to Phil.</p><p>Dan expected Phil to just stand next to him, but apparently Phil was in the mood to murder Dan because he stood closer than he really had to for the picture and then reached out an arm to wrap it around Dan\u2019s waist.</p><p>Dan\u2019s selfie arm faltered briefly at the sensation of Phil\u2019s warm arm on his body. He barely bit back a surprised squeak, since he knew that would make Phil think he was uncomfortable and he\u2019d move his arm. That was the last thing Dan wanted. Phil\u2019s half-embrace felt so strong and comforting and <i>safe</i>, Dan wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to survive when Phil eventually moved.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Dan asked, voice a little shaky.</p><p>\u201cYee!\u201d Phil replied.</p><p>Dan snapped a few photos, changing the angle slightly to try to capture the perfect shot. Normally, for a picture like this, he would give a half-smile, or maybe a smirk, but right now? There was no way he could keep the ridiculous grin from his face.</p><p>And then Phil turned his head and kissed Dan right on the cheek as Dan snapped a picture. Dan\u2019s eyes widened and his mouth dropped open in shock.</p><p><i>Did he just - he\u2019s still - oh my god. Oh my </i>GOD. <i>Okay, okay, okay, shhhhh, calm down before he gets weird about it, come on, get it together, Dan.</i></p><p>A flaming red blush spread across Dan\u2019s cheeks and his mouth spread in a face-splitting grin for the last few pictures Dan took. Butterflies zoomed around his stomach like they were trying to escape, and a few seemed to find their way out as giggles. A few of the giggles erupted from Dan\u2019s throat, and he covered his mouth with his hand to prevent any more from escaping</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t sure what to say as Phil pulled away from his cheek. He wasn\u2019t even sure where to <i>look</i>. He could still feel Phil\u2019s strong arm around his waist, and it made thinking difficult. His thoughts swirled wildly as he tried to figure out what to do. Should he look at Phil and let him see how Dan was still reeling? Should he run away? Should he act like nothing happened and look at the pictures? And would he ever stop grinning like a madman?</p><p>He opted for sending Phil a shy, happy glance, then pretending like nothing had happened (which was a little hard to do around his grin, but he tried to ignore that detail). He cleared his throat and looked at his phone, opening the photos app and scrolling through the selfies he took.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably at least one good one in here,\u201d Dan said to distract himself. He looked through the pictures, quickly skimming past the ones where Phil was kissing him to find the first photos.</p><p>\u201cWait - Phil! You\u2019re not even looking at the phone in any of these!\u201d Dan exclaimed, looking over at his date in mock irritation.</p><p>Phil was already looking at him with a fond smile. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not looking at the phone. How could I, when you\u2019re here in front of me?\u201d he asked softly. His face was open and honest, and the fond smile twitched until it grew into a full grin.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks darkened again. He opened his mouth to respond, but all that came out was a sort of strangled, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, his tongue poking through his teeth.</p><p><i>How does he keep getting more and more adorable, oh my god</i>. <i>This man will be the death of me.</i></p><p>Phil\u2019s arm dropped from around Dan\u2019s waist, much to Dan\u2019s disappointment.</p><p>\u201cCome on! We\u2019ve got more rides to go on!\u201d Phil reminded him gleefully. </p><p>He quickly re-discovered Dan\u2019s hand (making butterflies zoom around in his stomach again) and began pulling him out of the shop again, already going on about how he wanted to go on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad again.</p><p>Dan shook his head fondly, but followed Phil anyway.</p><p>A few hours later, they had ridden all Phil\u2019s favorites another time as well as the Winnie the Pooh ride, this time with their Pooh and Tigger ear hats, and they realized they were both starving.</p><p>They meandered over to Pinocchio\u2019s Village Haus for a quick dinner (Phil got chicken nuggets, which Dan found endearing as hell), and then headed back out for a few more roller coasters before they had to find a spot for the fireworks.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I know you love the roller coasters, but we really have to go pick our place to watch the fireworks!\u201d Dan laughed, tugging Phil\u2019s arm to get him to stay out of the line for the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> ride. \u201cBesides, we\u2019ve already been on this one three times. Haven\u2019t you had enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can never have too many pirates, Pooh!\u201d Phil exclaimed excitedly. He tugged right back on Dan\u2019s arm in a desperate attempt to return to the <i>Pirates</i> ride.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes in exasperation. \u201cBut the whole point of coming here was to show you the fireworks!\u201d He stuck out his bottom lip in a pout and batted his eyes at Phil. \u201cPwease, Phiw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwww, now that\u2019s just cheating,\u201d Phil whined. He pouted in return, but Dan wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>Dan jutted his bottom lip out even further, and Phil cracked.</p><p>\u201cOh, alright then,\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cLead the way.\u201d </p><p>A smug grin made its way onto Dan\u2019s lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Follow me, my liege,\u201d Dan said with a mock bow. He took a great deal of joy in the soft giggle he heard Phil make.</p><p>When Phil had agreed to the date, Dan had immediately made sure to reserve them a spot in front of Cinderella\u2019s Castle, where the view would be best. They headed to that area now, waiting for an attendant to allow them into the reserved section directly in front of the castle.</p><p>Even though it was still light out, there was a long line of people waiting to get into the reserved area, so Dan and Phil took their place at the back and hunkered down to wait.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do the fireworks come from, again? Like, which way should I be looking?\u201d Phil asked, inspecting the area around them as if he expected a firework to go off any moment.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole song and show and everything that\u2019ll be around the Castle,\u201d Dan told him. </p><p>Phil nodded absentmindedly, still looking around the park. </p><p>Dan took the quiet moment to appreciate the memories of the day. He thought about how excited Phil had been that morning, and how happy Phil had been when he learned that Dan loved Winnie the Pooh, and how insistent Phil was about the Winnie the Pooh-themed hats they were both still wearing. Dan thought about how <i>good</i> and <i>right</i> the whole day had felt, with the never-ending conversation and playful flirting and hand-holding. <i>God</i>, the <i>handholding</i>. He couldn\u2019t get enough of the feeling of his hand gently clutched by Phil\u2019s. Sometimes, Phil would run his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles, sending all coherent thought flying desperately from his brain and attracting all the blood to his cheeks, making it painfully obvious how much he <i>adored</i> Phil\u2019s actions. </p><p>As they waited for the fireworks, Dan tentatively moved his own thumb over Phil\u2019s hand, wondering if Phil would have a similar reaction to Dan. The blinding smile Phil sent Dan told him that yes, Phil liked that just as much as Dan.</p><p>Phil took a small step in so their sides were entirely pressed up against each other, then leaned in to be even closer.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil whispered with a light smile. \u201cToday\u2019s been great.\u201d</p><p>Dan beamed. The whole goal of the day had been to make Phil as happy as possible. He was proud to say that he firmly believed he had accomplished that goal, and they hadn\u2019t even seen the fireworks yet.</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen the fireworks yet. That was supposed to be the great part of the day,\u201d Dan reminded him.</p><p>Phil laughed gently, reaching up his free hand to carefully cup Dan\u2019s cheek. Dan\u2019s heartbeat quickened as he subconsciously leaned into the touch.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dan,\u201d Phil sighed happily. \u201cThe great part was spending time with you, no matter what we did.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s thumb caressed Dan\u2019s cheek, and Dan\u2019s brain shorted out.</p><p><i>He- I- Great? My face? His hand? My god.</i></p><p>Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, all Dan could think to say was a breathy, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s responding laugh brushed delicately against Dan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSpeechless, Howell? That\u2019s surprising,\u201d he teased. \u201cI like seeing you all flustered. I\u2019ll have to keep making it happen.\u201d He winked at Dan in his special Phil way, where it\u2019s more of a blink than a wink, then let go of Dan entirely and turned towards the line, which had finally moved forward to allow people into the reserved section.</p><p>Dan blinked in surprise. </p><p><i>What just happened? I didn\u2019t even notice the line move. What is this boy </i>doing<i> to me?</i></p><p>He shook himself slightly, quickly catching up to Phil and re-clasping their hands.</p><p><i>Should I address what just happened? What would I even say? I\u2019m not sure I know what happened, anyway. </i></p><p>Dan chanced a glance at Phil and saw a smirk playing at his lips.</p><p><i>That\u2019s a dangerous smirk. He looks mischievous - he\u2019s way too pleased with himself. It\u2019s probably best if I just move on, before I make more of a fool of myself.</i></p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d he began, louder than he expected. He winced internally, begging himself to be less awkward. Clearing his throat, he tried again, lowering his voice to a normal volume this time. \u201cSo, are you ready to see the most beautiful, captivating thing you will ever see?\u201d</p><p>A full smirk formed on Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen him. He\u2019s actually somehow letting me hold his hand,\u201d he said teasingly, swinging their hands pointedly.</p><p>Dan groaned, looking towards the heavens as if asking for God to come save him from this dork, but he couldn\u2019t disguise his smile, nor his accompanying blush. \u201cOh, <i>that</i> was cheesy as hell. I walked right into it, too, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He looked back at Phil with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly did.\u201d Phil grinned, bumping Dan\u2019s shoulder with his own. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re all blushy again, how adorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace. A danger to society. Too pure for this world,\u201d Dan deadpanned.</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cOne of these things is not like the other.\u201d</p><p>In a sing-song voice, Dan replied, \u201cBut all of them describe you perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Phil bumped Dan\u2019s shoulder again, harder this time. \u201cYour mum\u2019s a description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Dan shrieked out in a hyena laugh. \u201cThat- that doesn\u2019t even make sense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mum doesn\u2019t even-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare finish that sentence,\u201d Dan warned teasingly. \u201cLeave my poor mum alone.\u201d To make sure Phil didn\u2019t take him too seriously, Dan squeezed his hand lightly. If his heart raced a little faster when Phil squeezed back, well, no one had to know.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going to watch the fireworks from?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan hummed in thought, looking around the open area for a good spot. \u201cHow about right there?\u201d He pointed to a place near the front of the section, but far enough back that they wouldn\u2019t block everyone\u2019s line of sight with their tallness.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Phil agreed with a content nod. </p><p>Phil followed Dan to their spot. Once they got there, Dan hugged Phil\u2019s arm with his own free arm and rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Dan looked up at Phil from his shoulder. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d Dan asked. He felt Phil nod. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d came Phil\u2019s fond reply. Phil squeezed Dan\u2019s hand once, then brushed his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles again. </p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been leaning on Phil already, Dan was sure he would\u2019ve fallen over completely in a swoon. Phil somehow knew exactly what to do to make Dan unbelievably happy, and Dan was living for it.</p><p>For a few minutes, they stood in silence, just enjoying each other\u2019s presence and the feeling of their bodies pressed together as they waited for the fireworks. </p><p>The lights around the crowd went out, and Cinderella\u2019s Castle lit up.</p><p>\u201cIs it starting?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan resisted the urge to sass Phil, because <i>honestly, what else could be happening? Disney shut down the park with everyone still in it?</i></p><p>Instead, he hummed quietly in affirmation and snuggled closer into Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Music began, and the crowd was entranced. Oohs and Ahhs rang out in the plaza with every new animation and special effect. The lights and the music, combined with the magical experience that is spending a day at Disney World, always delivered a spectacular performance.</p><p>But Dan wasn\u2019t really paying attention. </p><p>Dan was looking at Phil. Well, some would call it <i>staring</i>, but Dan couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. </p><p>Phil\u2019s expression was so relaxed, so <i>happy</i>. Every new piece to the show had him gasping in delight, a childlike wonder in his eyes. Dan couldn\u2019t get enough of it.</p><p>And then Phil seemed to notice that Dan wasn\u2019t watching the fireworks. He turned his head slightly, looking at Dan, who was still carefully resting on his shoulder despite the Pooh ears.</p><p>Normally, Dan would\u2019ve been embarrassed to be caught staring, but all he could feel was an overwhelming affection for the man who had spent the whole day trying to make sure Dan had a good time, even though Dan was meant to be treating Phil. </p><p>A fond smile grew on Phil\u2019s face as he and Dan got lost in each other\u2019s gaze. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil whispered just loud enough to be heard over the fireworks and music. His free hand moved up and carded through Dan\u2019s exposed fringe slowly, then came to rest on his cheek. His thumb delicately traced Dan\u2019s cheekbone. </p><p>If he could, Dan would have purred at the gentle motion of Phil\u2019s thumb. Instead, he sighed through his nose and leaned into the touch with a smile. He trailed his fingers along Phil\u2019s forearm, appreciating how Phil shivered at the sensation. \u201cHi.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes quickly flickered over Dan\u2019s face, and his smile grew. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty,\u201d he stated simply, as if it were just a fact that the whole world should know.</p><p>Dan turned to hide his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder in embarrassment. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just say things like that,\u201d he whined. \u201cThey do weird things to me and make me feel all soft.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand moved from caressing Dan\u2019s face to rest comfortingly on Dan\u2019s waist. \u201cBut it\u2019s true! And I love seeing you blush when I tell you so.\u201d Phil wiggled his elbow. \u201cCome on, let me see your pretty face.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling false complaints, Dan slowly lifted his head to look Phil in the eye.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Phil whispered adoringly. He shifted his hand up from Dan\u2019s waist to gently cup his face, stroking his cheekbone with his thumb.</p><p>Dan felt his blush intensify and looked away for a moment to try to regain his composure. When he finally felt ready to look at Phil again, he found that Phil\u2019s gaze moving slowly over his face, taking in every detail.</p><p>It was a whole new feeling. Dan had realized throughout the day that, yes, Phil did actually kind of like him, but the way Phil looked at him now was so much <i>more</i> - more even than just moments before. This was an intense gaze, which intimidated Dan a little, but mostly he was just overwhelmed with happiness at the brilliant realization that Phil <i>liked him</i>. Dan felt wanted in a way that stretched beyond just the physical, and he was overcome with emotion.</p><p>His eyes could no longer stay still on Phil\u2019s. They trailed over his features, just as Phil\u2019s were doing to him, and took in the sharp cheekbones, the beaked nose, the freckles and spots, the way his pink lips contrasted his pale skin. And then all he could look at were Phil\u2019s lips. Their soft curve into Phil\u2019s small half-smile, the way they pouted out slightly. They looked soft. Kissable.</p><p><i>Are they as soft as they look? Would he kiss me if I asked?</i></p><p>Dan somehow managed to pull his eyes up from Phil\u2019s mouth to see his eyes instead. He wanted to know what Phil was thinking and know if he had any chance.</p><p>Phil was still looking at Dan\u2019s face, but it seemed his sights were stuck on Dan\u2019s mouth. Dan felt a shiver course through him when he thought of what Phil might be thinking. His shiver seemed to jolt Phil out of his thoughts, as his eyes snapped up to meet Dan\u2019s.</p><p>They stood still. Dan\u2019s thoughts were caught in a constant loop of <i>kiss me, kiss me, kiss me</i> as he tried to work up the courage to ask, but he wasn\u2019t sure he could bring himself to say the words. </p><p><i>Come on, just ask! You want to, and he seems like he wants to, and you just have to go for it. Just say it. He won\u2019t say no. But what if he does? What if I\u2019ve been reading the whole situation wrong?</i></p><p>As Dan\u2019s internal crisis continued, Phil took a small step forward, eliminating the last traces of space between their bodies. Phil\u2019s lips remained ever so slightly apart, like he wasn\u2019t sure he had Dan\u2019s permission.</p><p>Emboldened by Phil\u2019s move, Dan made a decision. Slowly, his eyelids fluttered closed, and he leaned in the smallest bit so their lips brushed.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand on Dan\u2019s cheek slid back into his hair, just below the edge of the Pooh hat, and brushed his fingers through the curls. Dan sighed into the kiss, and Phil\u2019s lips moved softly against Dan\u2019s. </p><p>It was a little tentative, and their noses bumped together awkwardly at first, but it felt right. They kept it slow and purposeful, just exploring the feeling of each other. Dan wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever had such a perfect first kiss, and he drowned in the sensation.</p><p>They pulled apart not too long after the kiss began. Bashful smiles grew on their faces as their eyes opened, and Dan bit his lip in an attempt to keep from grinning too much. Phil\u2019s tongue poked between his teeth a little, and Dan\u2019s heart melted. </p><p>Phil\u2019s fingers disentangled from Dan\u2019s, and Dan panicked.</p><p><i>He doesn\u2019t want to hold my hand anymore? What did I do wrong? Did he hate the kiss? But then why did he smile? What no-</i></p><p>Dan\u2019s thoughts were cut off by the feeling of Phil\u2019s now-free arm wrapping around Dan\u2019s shoulder and pulling him in to cuddle into Phil\u2019s side. Phil\u2019s other hand found Dan\u2019s again, and he clasped them in front of their bodies. </p><p><i>Oh.</i> Dan giggled. <i>That\u2019s better, then.</i></p><p>He rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder, careful to tip his head far enough backwards that he wouldn\u2019t dig his Pooh ears into Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p><i>This is the best first date </i>ever<i>.</i></p><p>They had missed most of the fireworks just staring at each other and kissing, but they caught the grand finale. Phil periodically made small noises of wonder and amazement that Dan wished he could bottle up and keep forever.</p><p>Too soon, the fireworks ended. Phil turned to Dan with a tired, but happy, smile, which Dan returned.</p><p>They made their way back through the crowd and to the parking lot, still hand-in-hand. It was a bit of a long walk, given the number of people trying to leave and the crazy distance from the park to the parking lot, but they were content to walk it in silence. The silence was comfortable, like a warm hug or a soft kiss. Dan wished the moment never had to end.</p><p>They eventually made it to Dan\u2019s car. Dan held the door open for Phil and shut it behind him, then went to open his own door and sit down behind the wheel.</p><p>Phil let out a deep, happy sigh. \u201cThat was really fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I had a really good time,\u201d Dan sighed happily as he started the car. He didn\u2019t move the car yet, though. Instead, he sat back in his seat and looked over at Phil with a small smile.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand crept forward and caught Dan\u2019s over the middle console, squeezing gently. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you missed some of the fireworks, though. That was kind of the whole reason we came,\u201d Dan said plainly, like he felt like it had to be said. He wasn\u2019t sorry at all, actually, as what made Phil miss the fireworks was infinitely better than the fireworks themselves. He was also fairly certain Phil wasn\u2019t too bothered by it, but he felt like it had to be said, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not. But, hey, that gives us something to do next time,\u201d Phil said casually, looking over at Dan, the ghost of a smile playing at his lips.</p><p>It took Dan\u2019s brain a moment to process Phil\u2019s words</p><p>\u201cNext time?\u201d he asked hopefully, a wide grin spreading across his face. <i>Please, this was amazing</i>.</p><p>\u201cYep. Maybe we\u2019ll go to Epcot to see those fireworks, instead.\u201d Phil smirked. \u201cOr maybe we\u2019ll miss those, too.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart skipped a bit and red flooded his cheeks.</p><p><i>Fuck. He wants to kiss me more? He wants to do this again. Oh my god.</i></p><p>Laughter outside the car jolted Dan out of his thoughts. A family walked past, and Dan watched them find their car. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better start driving home.\u201d </p><p>He put the car in gear and moved them towards the line of cars trying to leave the park. Phil started talking about his favorite funny moments of the day, and Dan chimed in with a few Phil missed. Phil also insisted that Dan tell him he was right about the Pooh hats. </p><p>\u201cThey were the most important thing. They completed the whole picture. You\u2019re the one always going on and on about aesthetics! There\u2019s no way you think they weren\u2019t the best idea ever,\u201d Phil argued playfully. He had a smug grin on his face and he poked Dan\u2019s arm a few times to drive his point home.</p><p><i>God, he\u2019s cute. He </i>so<i> wants me to agree with him, but I can\u2019t give up that easily</i>, Dan thought mischievously. A smirk formed on his face as he started to rile Phil up about it.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he drawled. \u201cWinnie the Pooh doesn\u2019t fit my aesthetic, especially not right now. Yellow ears with this pink and blue shirt? Major clashing goin\u2019 on here. I definitely look ridiculous.\u201d Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Phil\u2019s jaw drop in mock outrage. Dan\u2019s smirk grew as his plan succeeded.</p><p>\u201cWinnie the Pooh fits <i>everyone\u2019s</i> aesthetic! There\u2019s never a wrong time to wear Pooh ears, and looking ridiculous is the best part of it! Plus, we looked so cute together that it had to have been worth it,\u201d Phil declared indignantly.</p><p>\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d Dan hummed thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose we were a little cute, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Phil squawked. \u201cA <i>little</i>? Only a <i>little</i>? I\u2019ll have you know we were <i>definitely</i> the cutest people anyone saw at the Magic Kingdom <i>all day</i>,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEveryone was jealous of us.\u201d He crossed his arms with a huff, shooting Dan a sour glare. \u201cIt was the <i>best</i> idea.\u201d</p><p>Dan finally couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter anymore, letting it out in a loud burst absolutely <i>drenched</i> in fondness. He reached a hand out and pried Phil\u2019s arms apart so he could hold Phil\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you, Phil! I loved the hats and the cute couple aesthetic and how jealous we made everyone else. They <i>were</i> the best idea.\u201d He chanced a glance over at Phil, who had finally relaxed back into his seat after tensely arguing his points. Dan sent him an affectionate smile. \u201cThank you. They made my day. Well,\u201d he added after a beat, \u201cmaybe not <i>quite</i>. The fireworks would be hard to beat.\u201d</p><p>Phil blushed heavily, biting his lip to hide a grin. \u201cGood. Great. The hats and the\u2026 <i>fireworks</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled their clasped hands to his face and pressed a delicate kiss to the back of Phil\u2019s hand, delighting in the quiet giggle it tugged from Phil, then let go of Phil\u2019s hand to put his hand back on the steering wheel.</p><p>After a few minutes of companionable silence, they moved on to talking about their jobs and why they worked at Disney, describing the incomparable feeling of bringing the magical joy to everyone who visited. Somehow, these conversations led them all the way back to Phil\u2019s house. Dan wasn\u2019t sure where the time went, but he wished it would come back.</p><p>He pulled over in front of Phil\u2019s house and put the car in park, resting his hand on the middle console.</p><p><i>I really don\u2019t want this to end.</i></p><p>Apparently Phil didn\u2019t want it to end either, as he made no move to get up. He just sat, staring at his house for a moment, then he turned to Dan.</p><p>\u201cI really did have a great time,\u201d he said quietly, reaching out to play with Dan\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Dan smiled softly, meeting Phil\u2019s gaze. \u201cMe too,\u201d he whispered fondly. He moved his hand slightly so it was holding Phil\u2019s, and he squeezed gently.</p><p>\u201cThanks for treating me. It was sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks flushed, and he looked down. \u201cYou deserve to feel special,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Soft fingers brushed against Dan\u2019s jaw, carefully raising his face so he would look at Phil.</p><p><i>Phil\u2019s so beautiful. How did I even get here? </i></p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Phil whispered. \u201cSo, if it\u2019s okay with you, <i>I\u2019ll</i> take <i>you</i> out next time.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded slowly. He was completely speechless with happiness. Phil had just confirmed that this would happen again, and Dan was thrilled and just a bit overwhelmed, especially with how Phil\u2019s hand caressed his cheek and how close Phil\u2019s face was to his. </p><p>And then Phil\u2019s face came even closer, and Dan\u2019s eyes closed as their lips touched.</p><p>It was a soft and sweet kiss, shorter than the ones earlier that night, and it left Dan wanting more as Phil pulled away.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Phil whispered, his breath fanning across Dan\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Dan replied softly, his eyes locked on Phil\u2019s. He wished the night didn\u2019t have to end, that he could spend more time with Phil, but he didn\u2019t push it. Maybe a different night, but not right now. The rest of their day had already been perfect, anyway.</p><p>Phil smiled, then turned and got out of the car, quickly walking up the walkway to his house.</p><p>Dan stared after him in a daze, reaching up and touching his lips with his fingers. He let out a lovestruck sigh, then smiled wide as he started to drive back home.</p><p>A memory came to him as he drove, and he smiled, then laughed.</p><p>He definitely didn\u2019t need to worry about some six-year-old coming and stealing his Phil away.</p>",

How his heart hadn\u2019t yet fallen out of his ass from the sheer power of emotion, Dan wasn\u2019t sure. Phil was literally Dan\u2019s ideal man. And Phil had agreed to go on a date with him. As excited as Dan was, he was equally filled with anxiety at everything that could go wrong.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t fuck it up, Dan</i>.</p><p>On the drive over to Phil\u2019s house, Dan worried that he had somehow gotten the wrong address, or that his phone\u2019s GPS had sent him the wrong way, or that he\u2019d be late to pick Phil up, or that Phil would have already left his house and moved back to England.</p><p>It was ridiculous, honestly, but Dan couldn\u2019t help it. He <i>really</i> wanted this date to work out.</p><p>Every red light added to his stress. He kept glancing at the little clock in his car, watching the minutes pass. He was supposed to pick Phil up at 7am sharp, but the time ticked closer and closer, and Dan felt like he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere closer to Phil\u2019s house anytime soon. His nerves grew with every second that passed, and he found himself chewing on his lip in anticipation. He had done his best to leave his house with time to spare, but now that he was actually en route, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d made it out the door in time. </p><p><i>He\u2019ll be so disappointed if I\u2019m late. Dan the Fuck-Up, as usual, can\u2019t even be bothered to make it to a date on time. Classic- </i></p><p>\u201cArrived,\u201d said the mechanical voice on Dan\u2019s phone, interrupting Dan\u2019s spiral of thoughts. </p><p>Dan pulled over in front of a small house. It looked like it might have been white, but Dan couldn\u2019t be sure in the faint early morning light.</p><p>He anxiously checked the clock again. It was 7:06.</p><p><i>Bloody typical.</i></p><p>Phil had told Dan to text when he arrived, saying it would be easier than knocking on the door and waking up Phil\u2019s housemates and suffering their persistent teasing. Dan didn\u2019t waste any time grabbing his phone from the passenger\u2019s seat and texting Phil. He didn\u2019t want Phil to have to wait any longer than he already had.</p><p><b>Dan:</b> im here</p><p>Phil\u2019s response came within seconds, startling Dan.</p><p><i>He responded so fast, he must have been waiting. Dammit, Dan, why are you always late?! He\u2019s probably mad about it.</i></p><p>He took a deep breath and opened the message.</p><p><b>Phil:<i> </i></b>gr8 gimme 2 secs i\u2019ll b right there</p><p>Dan let out the breath he had been holding. Phil wasn\u2019t mad. At least, Dan assumed so, since Phil said he was coming. </p><p>Nervously, Dan\u2019s hands began dancing and tapping randomly on the steering wheel of his car.  </p><p><i>He\u2019s coming. Oh my god, the date is about to start. Oh my god. </i></p><p>He looked outside the window, anxiously watching the door of the house- but then he looked away to look at the road because watching the door meant actively waiting for Phil to exit his house, which was stressful in itself because it made him think about how much time was passing and how much time Phil had to change his mind and decide not to come on the date after all.</p><p><i>This date has to be </i>perfect<i>. If it\u2019s not perfect, he won\u2019t want to go on another date and you\u2019ll end up alone and sad. </i></p><p>Dan noticed his leg was bouncing erratically from the nerves and forced himself to take a breath.</p><p><i>It\u2019ll be okay. He wanted to go with you this time, so he clearly must like </i>something<i> about you. Just chill out.</i></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the house opened and Phil stepped out, turning and locking it behind him.</p><p>The nerves struck Dan again as Phil approached, manifesting in even more intense finger tapping. Phil\u2019s hair was quiffed up off his forehead, and Dan ached to run his fingers through it. He wore a red plaid shirt, well-fitted to his broad shoulders and making his biceps pop. His black skinny jeans had rips in the knees, giving him a bit of an edgy aesthetic that Dan knew didn\u2019t reflect Phil\u2019s true nerdy, kind personality. Dan was intimidated as hell by Phil\u2019s appearance. How could he look so put-together this early in the morning?? It literally was not fair, and Dan felt inadequate in his own ripped black skinny jeans and cherry blossom button-up. His leg started to vibrate again, and he rolled his eyes at himself.</p><p><i>Get it together, Dan</i>.</p><p>They made eye contact through the windscreen, and Phil flashed Dan one of his absolutely <i>adorable</i> smiles. Dan\u2019s heartbeat picked up even more at the sight, and he managed a small smile in return.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so perfect.</i></p><p>Phil arrived at the passenger door and pulled the handle. The door didn\u2019t open. Phil shot Dan a confused look through the window. His brows were furrowed, and there was a cute little wrinkle in the middle of his forehead. Phil pulled the handle again, then pouted up at Dan. His bottom lip was sticking out, and his eyebrows were lifting.</p><p><i>What? Why isn\u2019t it ope-</i> <i>Oh.</i></p><p>Dan sheepishly flipped the \u201cunlock\u201d switch on the control panel next to his arm, then motioned for Phil to try again. This time, it worked, and Phil slid into the seat with a cheeky smile. </p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were excited for this date,\u201d Phil teased lightheartedly.</p><p><i>Shit! Now he thinks I don\u2019t want this!</i></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Dan exclaimed loudly, eyes wide and hands reaching out as if to grab Phil\u2019s arm and keep him in the car.</p><p>Phil blinked, tilting his head to the side and furrowing his brow. Clearly, Dan had confused him again. </p><p>Dan winced at his own unending awkwardness, then backpedaled to try to salvage the conversation that had <i>barely even begun, god, get it together, Dan</i>. </p><p>\u201cI am <i>really</i> excited for this date, Phil, you have no idea,\u201d he began, refusing to look at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m just also really nervous-\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s giggle interrupted the beginnings of a rant that surely would make Dan feel much worse. \u201cI\u2019m kidding! I know you\u2019re excited,\u201d Phil laughed. </p><p>The fondness in Phil\u2019s voice caused Dan to cautiously look at Phil out of the corner of his eye. </p><p>Sure enough, the fondest of smiles graced Phil\u2019s lips. Dan could feel himself blushing, and he hoped Phil wouldn\u2019t notice (but he was sure the color on his cheeks was glaringly obvious). </p><p>Slowly, Phil reached a tentative hand out to one of Dan\u2019s, gently prying his white-knuckled grasp off the steering wheel to intertwine their fingers. Dan stared at their linked hands in wonder. Phil\u2019s hand was a little smaller and a lot paler, but it looked perfect in Dan\u2019s. Dan felt a clammy warmth coming from Phil\u2019s palm, and he relaxed a little when he realized that must mean that Phil wasn\u2019t feeling as confident as he seemed- at least Dan wasn\u2019t alone in his nerves. </p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s okay that you\u2019re nervous. I\u2019m nervous, too.\u201d Phil leaned in closer to Dan to whisper conspiratorially, \u201cPlus, you\u2019re really cute when you blush.\u201d</p><p>Dan figured that Phil would probably think Dan was \u201creally cute\u201d most of the date, then, because he couldn\u2019t seem to get his cheeks to calm down. If anything, he was pretty sure his cheeks were getting even more red.</p><p>Flustered, Dan didn\u2019t know what to say in response, so he just looked back at the road, shaking his head in slight disbelief.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t know how he could think I\u2019m cute when he\u2019s obviously the cutest person in the universe</i>.</p><p>Dan swallowed nervously. \u201cWe should- uh- get going. The whole point of getting up before daylight was to get there early, right?\u201d Dan said, deciding to ignore Phil\u2019s comment entirely. </p><p>Phil shrugged and leaned back in his seat, releasing Dan\u2019s hand so he could drive.</p><p>He carefully checked that the road was clear before pulling into the lane.</p><p>Although his eyes were trained on the street, Dan could practically <i>feel</i> Phil\u2019s self-satisfied grin. He couldn\u2019t help the blush that just wouldn\u2019t go away, not when he knew Phil was smiling because of him. </p><p><i>That cute bitch. God, I\u2019m a mess.</i></p><p>Phil must have sensed Dan\u2019s current inability to converse like a proper human being, and decided to take pity on him because he took charge of the conversation. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved Disney.\u201d Phil said thoughtfully. \u201cI was definitely that kid who sat inside all day rewatching <i>The Lion King</i> until my parents couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d He chuckled at himself, then continued. \u201cI think they eventually broke the tape on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Dan pictured it - a tiny Phil sat in front of a shitty \u201890s television, dressed in absolutely horrendous \u201890s fashion, and singing along at the top of his lungs. He was probably dreadfully off-key even then. </p><p>He laughed at the mental image, glancing over at Phil as if trying to picture this adult man in the same situation. \u201cThat sounds cute as fuck, Phil,\u201d he said through the laugh.</p><p>\u201cDoes it really?\u201d Phil asked, sounding surprised. \u201dSeems a bit annoying, if you ask me. My parents certainly thought so,\u201d Phil mused.</p><p>Dan shook his head, and snuck another glance at Phil. </p><p>\u201cDefinitely cute as fuck,\u201d Dan adamantly assured Phil. He was almost offended that anyone could be annoyed with Phil. \u201cAnd you know what, <i>The Lion King </i>is amazing, so we are gonna sing it right now, on the way to Disney, because we are adults and no one can stop us,\u201d he declared.</p><p><i>Shit, what if he doesn\u2019t want to, though?</i></p><p>Dan quickly side-eyed Phil, saying, \u201cYou know, if you want, that is. We don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>But Dan\u2019s concern was unnecessary, as Phil was already grinning and pulling out his phone to find the soundtrack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it now, Howell. The offer has been made and there\u2019s no going back,\u201d Phil said just as \u201cThe Circle of Life\u201d began to play from his phone.</p><p>\u201cNaaaaaaans lasagna baby itsy baby!\u201d Phil sang along loudly. He was extremely pitchy, but he didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i>, Phil!\u201d Dan yelled through a hyena laugh. \u201cThose <i>so</i> aren\u2019t the lyrics, oh my <i>god</i>!\u201d </p><p>Phil ignored him and continued to sing, moving to the background chorus \u201clyrics\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama. It\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama.\u201d </p><p>Dan laughed harder, doing his best to keep his attention primarily focused on the road. </p><p><i>He\u2019s having so much fun with this. I bet it\u2019d make him happy if I sing like that, too.</i></p><p>Dan would do pretty much anything to make Phil smile, so he joined in, singing, \u201cIt\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama\u201d just as loudly and carelessly as Phil.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Dan could see Phil turn his head to look at him. Dan felt himself absolutely <i>melting</i> under the fond giddiness in Phil\u2019s gaze.</p><p><i>Today\u2019s gonna be such a good day.</i></p><p>They spent a majority of the drive singing along to various Disney songs, sticking to <i>The Lion King</i> at first but expanding to some of their other Disney favorites like <i>Mulan </i>(Dan loved singing his dramatic rendition of \u201cReflection\u201d) and <i>The Little Mermaid </i>(they couldn\u2019t <i>not</i>. Phil was Prince Eric, after all). </p><p>\u201cSo, I told you what my favorite Disney movie growing up was, now it\u2019s your turn,\u201d Phil began as the last note of \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d faded away. \u201cWhat did your poor parents have to put up with?\u201d</p><p>Dan blushed, his eyes darting over to glance at Phil. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>Phil scoffed. \u201cImpossible. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s perfectly endearing.\u201d Dan shook his head but Phil continued, sounding almost petulant. \u201cEither way, you have to tell me because I already told you mine.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but gave in. Phil could probably make him give into anything. \u201cOkay, fine. My favorite Disney cartoon was Winnie the Pooh. It\u2019s lit<i>-tra-</i>ly why I have such a posh accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwwwww, I love Winnie the Pooh!\u201d Phil cooed. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t my favorite, but he was so wonderful.\u201d </p><p>Dan glanced over, surprised by Phil\u2019s enthusiastic reaction. Phil was already staring back at him with a small, fond smile.</p><p>Just as Dan was about to speak up, maybe change the subject because he still felt a bit embarrassed, Phil spoke again. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not all that surprised your favorite was Winnie the Pooh. You kind of remind me of him, in a way,\u201d he said thoughtfully. </p><p>Dan smiled, but couldn\u2019t keep the confusion out of his expression, his head tilting to the side slightly and his eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>\u201cI really remind you of Winnie the Pooh?\u201d Dan asked, baffled.</p><p>In his peripheral vision, Dan caught a glimpse of Phil. Phil was staring out the window like he was deep in thought, scrunching up his eyebrows slightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this kind of calm chillness about you, but I still know you\u2019ll work hard to get what you want. Like, you work for what you care about but still take it easy every now and then, if that makes sense. And you seem to care a lot about your friends, which is very Pooh.\u201d </p><p>There was a thoughtfulness and sincerity to his voice that caught Dan off guard. <i>How does he know that about me already? Does he really pay that much attention?</i> Warmth filled Dan as he considered that maybe Phil liked him as much as he liked Phil.</p><p>But then Phil grinned, continuing cheekily, \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure what you want usually isn\u2019t a pot of honey.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a snort. \u201c<i>Most</i> of that was actually very perceptive of you,\u201d he replied fondly, glancing over at Phil with a soft smile. </p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cNo, not really. It\u2019s not that hard to recognize that you\u2019ve never taken a pot of honey to work,\u201d he tried to say casually, but he couldn\u2019t quite keep the amusement from his voice.</p><p>Dan groaned and rolled his eyes, but he laughed affectionately. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dork!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s a dork!\u201d Phil retorted in a faux-defensive tone.</p><p>\u201cOi, you leave my mum out of this!\u201d Dan laughed, reaching over to poke Phil\u2019s leg.</p><p>The conversation dissolved into laughter and more meaningless, but fun, banter. Dan lost track of the time, his brain in autopilot as he drove them the rest of the way to Disney, and he found himself almost sad when they arrived. The drive had gone so well, what if things got awkward when they were wandering around?</p><p>Dan\u2019s worry didn\u2019t last long, however, as Phil continued to talk just as he had in the car. As they walked into the park, they made a quick list of rides they <i>had</i> to go on, and then they were off.</p><p>Creepy dolls sang \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d to them (Phil regretted that suggestion; he told Dan he definitely gave himself nightmare material for weeks), they journeyed through the Caribbean with cunning pirates to find Spanish gold, and they took a tour through Neverland. Each ride had a long enough line that they could talk for a short while, but they didn\u2019t feel like they were wasting the day just waiting around.</p><p>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was definitely Phil\u2019s favorite. He made Dan go on it three times in a row. And because Phil just looked too adorable when he was excited (his eyes lit up as he smiled and bounced on the balls of his feet, insisting they had to <i>go go go again right now, it\u2019s so fun!</i>), Dan couldn\u2019t say no. Plus, it was kind of a small cart and they were rather tall. Dan wasn\u2019t about to give up the chance to be squished into Phil\u2019s side.</p><p>They wandered into Liberty Square for lunch. Dan had timed it perfectly, because it was just before a parade was supposed to begin. He thought Phil might enjoy seeing the characters and hearing the music as a guest rather than an employee for once, since he was always so excited about the magic of Disney. Dan <i>loved</i> it when the magic would excite Phil; Phil\u2019s inner child would shine through, lighting up his face and making him giggle in wonder.</p><p>\u201cWe <i>have</i> to go to Sleepy Hollow,\u201d Dan insisted as he pointed to the restaurant with one hand, excitedly tapping Phil\u2019s arm with his other. \u201cThey have the best damn chicken and waffles you will ever have in your life, and there\u2019s a little picnic area so we can watch the parade go by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a pancakes man, to be honest,\u201d Phil said dubiously. \u201cBut I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d He flashed Dan a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cThese are so much more than a breakfast food, Phil, they are <i>art</i>. They make sandwiches out of the waffle and put this spicy chicken inside and-\u201d Dan moaned theatrically- \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, it\u2019s just <i>so good</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, lead the way!\u201d Phil conceded, and gestured for Dan to go ahead of him. Dan reached behind him and pulled Phil after him by the forearm as he hurriedly made his way into the restaurant.</p><p>Phil let Dan pick his waffle for him, and then took out his wallet to pay.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, put that away!\u201d Dan insisted, pushing Phil\u2019s arm down. \u201cI asked you out, so I\u2019m paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d Phil started, his hand still reaching into his wallet.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Dan lightly hip-checked Phil out of the way and handed his card over to the cashier. \u201cI\u2019ve got this, okay?\u201d He turned to look at Phil again to see him rolling his eyes, which worried him until he noticed Phil\u2019s small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous, but okay.\u201d Phil gave Dan\u2019s shoulder a mini shove to retaliate for the hip-check.</p><p>A few minutes later, they retrieved the waffles and sat down at a table near the edge of the patio so they could see the parade when it came.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for your life to change dramatically?\u201d Dan asked seriously as they each picked up their waffle sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019m a little scared. That\u2019s a lot of pressure riding on this one sandwich,\u201d Phil teased. He eyed the sandwich skeptically, eyes narrowed in distrust.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s deserved, believe me,\u201d Dan said. \u201cCome on, then. I\u2019m waiting for your reaction.\u201d Dan leaned in closer and stared at Phil eagerly, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil eyed his sandwich with a curious expression - part wary and part excited - before he leaned in, opened his mouth wide, and took a big bite. </p><p>He seemed to consider for a moment, and then his eyes widened comically. He looked at Dan with pure wonder on his face. His lips were tilting up into a smile, even though his mouth was full of food.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan said, nodding seriously.</p><p>\u201cHow - it\u2019s - oh my god,\u201d Phil groaned around his bite of food.</p><p>\u201cI <i>know</i>,\u201d Dan laughed. He leaned back in his seat, relieved at Phil\u2019s reaction. \u201cYou like it, then?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded vigorously, already going in for another bite.</p><p>Dan laughed again, then took a bite of his own sandwich and moaned at the flavor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really spicy but it\u2019s so good,\u201d Phil managed when he finally swallowed. He chugged a few gulps of water, then dove back into the sandwich.</p><p>Dan felt a strange sense of pride well up in him. Phil had trusted Dan\u2019s suggestion and it paid off <i>brilliantly</i>. </p><p>Just then, the front of the parade passed by their seating area. The magic of seeing the characters wasn\u2019t as strong for Dan or Phil now that they\u2019ve done parades and meet and greets before, but that didn\u2019t stop them from enjoying it. Mickey Mouse waved at them, and Phil squealed in delight.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mickey!\u201d he called excitedly, bouncing in his seat a bit and waving his arm wildly.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so precious, oh my god</i>.</p><p>\u201cMickey Mouse waved at me, Dan! I feel special,\u201d Phil exclaimed, looking at Dan with the gleeful excitement of a child.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Dan said softly. His body was frozen, his hands half-raised to his mouth with the last few bites of his waffle sandwich, but his eyes wandered Phil\u2019s face, taking in the joy and giddiness. Phil\u2019s happiness was infectious, and Dan found himself smiling affectionately at this excitable man who had somehow agreed to go on a date with <i>Dan</i>, of all people.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face flushed, and he broke eye contact for a moment to look down at his food tray, then cautiously looked back up at Dan through his lashes. Dan felt a fresh surge of affection as he saw how bashful Phil got at the compliment. </p><p>They stared at each other silently for a moment, faces turning redder by the second, until Dan cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, you liked the waffle, then?\u201d He pointed at the sticky mess left on the tray where Phil\u2019s sandwich used to be.</p><p>Phil nodded. \u201cLife-changing, as advertised. Thanks for the suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it,\u201d Dan replied. He cleared his throat again. \u201cSo, after the parade crowd clears out a bit, do you wanna go to the Haunted Mansion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Phil agreed. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the crowd to disperse once the parade ended, and then Dan and Phil were off to find the Haunted Mansion.</p><p>On the way, they encountered a traffic jam where some families were apparently meeting a character. A huge crowd of people stood in the way, blocking the whole path. Dan felt a twinge of sympathy for the handler, knowing how hard it could be to keep a crowd under control, especially in walkways. As a handler, he hated when people tried to force their way through, but he was a man on a mission. He\u2019d just try not to be too aggressive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go for it,\u201d Dan decided, already sending mental apologies to the handler. \u201cStay close?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded, and Dan pushed himself into the small gaps between people with Phil on his heels.</p><p>Except Phil wasn\u2019t quite as on-his-heels as he expected. Dan had moved a little too fast for Phil to keep up in such a cramped space. A hand grasped onto Dan\u2019s wrist, and he jumped, glancing back quickly to see Phil\u2019s arm outstretched. </p><p><i>Phil\u2019s basically holding my hand. It\u2019s fine, nothing to worry about. Totally cool over here. It\u2019s all good.</i></p><p>They finally broke free of the crowd and could stand next to each other again. Dan expected Phil to drop his wrist now that they had room to maneuver, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, Phil\u2019s hand slid down to lace their fingers together.</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart beat faster, and he stared down at their clasped hands. <i>Be cool, Dan, he\u2019s just holding your hand.</i></p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Phil asked tentatively.</p><p>Dan\u2019s head snapped up to make eye contact. Phil was blushing and looked like he was making a concerted effort not to hide his face.</p><p>\u201cHm? The hands? Yes, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s - it\u2019s great. Perfect, really.\u201d Dan fumbled, flustered.</p><p><i>I said be cool, that is </i>not<i> being cool</i>.</p><p>Phil\u2019s free hand rose up to cover his mouth slightly, trying to hide a giggle, but the crows feet around his eyes gave him away.</p><p>\u201cNooooo, don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d Dan whined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil said through his laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re just too adorable.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks were definitely bright red by now. \u201cShut up,\u201d he grumbled. He stuck out his bottom lip in an exaggerated pout. </p><p>\u201cAwwww,\u201d Phil cooed. \u201cYou\u2019re really not making me think you\u2019re less adorable, if that was the goal.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out an exaggerated huff and walked slightly ahead of Phil - just far enough ahead to keep up his dramatic charade, but close enough that they could still hold hands.</p><p>They arrived at the Haunted Mansion line and worked their way to the front. Along the way, Dan and Phil took turns reading out all of the silly tombstones of the dead residents. Every so often, Phil would laugh at one of the funny ways of dying and say, \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d </p><p>On the ride itself, Dan cozied up to Phil as much as he dare. The seats were much bigger than Big Thunder Railroad and he - unfortunately - didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to squish into Phil\u2019s side in order to fit. He didn\u2019t want to drape himself all over Phil, but he wanted to be as close as was reasonably possible, so he settled for sitting close enough that their sides touched from shoulder to knee.</p><p><i>Is this too much? Is he uncomfortable? Oh, god, this was a mistake, wasn\u2019t it.</i></p><p>But then Phil\u2019s foot bumped Dan\u2019s, nudging it gently before hooking his ankle around Dan\u2019s.</p><p>Dan looked at Phil, happy to know that apparently Phil wanted to be close just as much as Dan, but Phil was steadfastly observing the other side of their cart. Dan rolled his eyes fondly and relaxed into the chair.</p><p>Their cart turned a corner, and the ride properly began. </p><p>Some of the spooks startled Phil throughout the ride, and Dan laughed at him for it.</p><p>\u201cReally, Phil? How didn\u2019t you expect that to pop up?\u201d Dan would tease, squeezing Phil\u2019s hand briefly.</p><p>\u201cShhhh, I just wasn\u2019t paying enough attention!\u201d Phil would reply, squeezing right back.</p><p>About halfway through the ride, the cart spun around and began descending a sharp hill backwards. Gravity squished Dan and Phil to the middle of the seat, right up against each other.</p><p>Dan breathed in sharply as their bodies pressed together even more than they already had been, and he quickly looked over at Phil\u2019s face. Phil was already looking at him, blushing heavily.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil whispered shyly. He flexed his fingers around Dan\u2019s before squeezing gently.</p><p>Equally shyly, Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>When the cart straightened out, neither of them made any effort to readjust to sit farther away from the other. Dan felt his heart soar when he realized that meant Phil wanted to be close to him, too.</p><p>Not long after, the ride came to an end. Phil let go of Dan\u2019s hand to climb out of the cart, then reached back to offer his hand as a support as Dan followed.</p><p>\u201cHow gentlemanly,\u201d Dan commented with a slight quirk of his lips. Inside, he was gushing about how sweet Phil was and how much he loved the feeling of the soft skin of Phil\u2019s hand against his own. He worried Phil would let go of his hand as soon as he got off the ride, but Phil only adjusted his grip to interlock their fingers again. He brushed his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles, and butterflies erupted in Dan\u2019s stomach.</p><p>As they left the Haunted Mansion set, they debated where to go next.</p><p>Phil\u2019s vote was the Winnie the Pooh ride.</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s such a cute one! Besides, you said you loved Pooh!\u201d Phil eagerly suggested.</p><p>Dan laughed and let Phil pull him across the park to the ride.</p><p><i>He wants to make me happy so much. I\u2019m supposed to be making sure we go on rides </i>he<i> likes but he\u2019s over here pushing me to do something for personal nostalgia\u2019s sake. He\u2019s so sweet.</i></p><p>Fortunately, the line wasn\u2019t too long, so they passed through the interactive buttons and animatronics until they made it to the carts. </p><p>They had to drop their hands to climb into the carts, much to Dan\u2019s annoyance, but he relaxed when Phil sat down probably closer than was strictly necessary.</p><p>Phil leaned in to whisper in Dan\u2019s ear, \u201cWill you hold my hand if I get scared?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a loud laugh, turning his head to look at Phil.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Winnie the Pooh, so I doubt that\u2019ll be a problem.\u201d His hand found Phil\u2019s anyway as the ride began to move, already desperate for the comforting warmth and the accompanying rush of giddy excitement that Dan was beginning to associate with holding Phil\u2019s hand. Dan felt a grin breaking out on his face, playing it off as excitement for Winnie the Pooh. He looked around at the walls, quickly reading the giant storybook page that set up the story for the ride.</p><p>Just before they entered the ride, Dan looked back at Phil with a soft smile and quietly admitted, \u201cI like holding your hand, even if you aren\u2019t scared.\u201d</p><p>Phil bit his lip around a giddy smile, and Dan\u2019s heart just about melted at the sight.</p><p>\u201cOi, you\u2019ll miss the ride if you keep looking at me,\u201d Phil complained, nudging Dan\u2019s elbow with his own.</p><p>\u201cMmm, but I really like looking at you. Especially when I get you to blush like that,\u201d Dan teased, nudging Phil\u2019s shoulder playfully. He relented, though, deciding to enjoy the ride as Phil insisted.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly thrilling ride, by any means. There were a few jerky turns and wobbles, but no dips or spins, and the pace was fairly slow. They both giggled as the ride bounced up and down, mimicking Tigger\u2019s bouncing.</p><p>Dan loved it anyway, partly because of the nostalgia of Winnie the Pooh and partly because of how into it Phil was. He never was <i>actually</i> scared, but he pretended to be when they came to the section of Heffalumps and Woozles, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand harder and bringing his other arm to hug Dan\u2019s. Phil\u2019s head came to rest on Dan\u2019s shoulder, and Dan went perfectly still.</p><p><i>Oh my god. He\u2019s so precious. Don\u2019t move, Dan, or he\u2019ll move</i>.</p><p>Luckily, it seemed that Phil had no intention of moving away from Dan for the rest of the ride. He stayed snuggled up to Dan\u2019s arm for the last few minutes of the story, then reluctantly detached himself as their cart came to the end. </p><p>\u201cThat was a great idea, Phil. I\u2019m glad you dragged me over here,\u201d Dan said happily as they exited the track area. He couldn\u2019t get the dopey smile off his face.</p><p>Phil gasped, ignoring Dan entirely in favor of pointing to the alcove next to the ride and tugging on their still-clasped hands. </p><p>\u201cLook! Tigger and Pooh are there for photos!\u201d He turned to Dan, expression extremely serious. \u201cWe have to go get pictures with them.\u201d</p><p>Dan was on the verge of saying no. They most likely knew whoever it was in the costumes, so some of the magic was already missing from the experience. Besides, it would <i>definitely</i> be weird if two awkwardly tall adult men got in line to meet <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>.</p><p>But Phil looked so excited and happy, Dan couldn\u2019t find it in himself to decline. Instead, he sighed in mock exasperation and gestured for Phil to lead the way.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face lit up even more, making Dan smile and shake his head fondly. </p><p><i>He\u2019s such a dork. I love that he\u2019s so willing to let himself be a kid at Disney. He really makes the magic come to life.</i></p><p>The line to meet Pooh and Tigger was significantly longer than the line for the ride had been, so they occupied their time by sharing anecdotes about their childhood experiences. Phil had several stories about the crazy things he did or believed as a kid, like how he thought the \u201cD\u201d in the Disney logo was actually a \u201cG\u201d or how crowds cheering at football matches scared him to the point of tears.</p><p>(Dan, of course, found this very endearing and jokingly promised he would never cheer at a football match in front of Phil.)</p><p>In exchange, Dan told Phil a few stories about some of his more embarrassing failures and awkward moments growing up, like how he got fired from his last job for selling an axe to a twelve-year-old. </p><p>Finally, they made it to the front of the line and got to meet Tigger and Pooh. They each got to hug both characters, much to Phil\u2019s delight. Before they took the picture, they also got to \u201ctalk\u201d with the animals. Neither character could actually say anything, but Tigger had some <i>very</i> articulate gestures.</p><p>He looked at Dan, then pointed back and forth between Dan and Phil, who was having an animated conversation with Pooh and completely unaware of the attention. Dan wasn\u2019t entirely sure, but he thought maybe Tigger had caught on to their affection. Sure enough, Tigger placed both hands over his heart and tilted his head.</p><p>Blushing, Dan laughed. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re here on a date,\u201d he confirmed in a low voice, trying not to attract Phil\u2019s attention away from where he talked with Pooh. It wasn\u2019t that the date was a secret, Dan just felt a little self-conscious that he was talking to one of his childhood idols - and probably coworkers, honestly - about a <i>date</i>.</p><p>Tigger gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up - or at least the closest thing he could get to a thumbs up in his costume. He took Dan\u2019s hand to guide him to Phil, made them hold hands, then moved to stand on the other side of Phil. Pooh stood next to Dan, and they were ready for pictures.</p><p>Dan and Phil both blushed profusely at Tigger\u2019s antics, even though they\u2019d already been holding hands all day. It was just a different experience when someone else noticed their feelings and nudged them together, showing Dan that maybe they <i>did</i> work well together. Plus, Dan realized that he was about to actually take a picture while <i>holding hands with Phil</i>, which would immortalize this perfect moment.</p><p>They took a few nice pictures with Pooh and Tigger, then bade them goodbye and left the meeting spot, still hand-in-hand.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing! Tigger saw right through us, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Phil chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHe definitely did,\u201d Dan agreed. He swung their clasped hands around slightly, enjoying the sensation of the contact. Casually, he added, \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s anybody we know today\u2026 We\u2019ll <i>definitely</i> be hearing about this at work later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh!\u201d Phil clapped a hand over Dan\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s <i>Tigger</i>, not somebody we know!\u201d he scolded, shaking his head in mock disappointment.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and smiled under Phil\u2019s hand. \u201cOf course, how could I ever forget,\u201d he deadpanned, though it came out warbled and muffled.</p><p>Phil narrowed his eyes at Dan suspiciously, then nodded once. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you said, but I\u2019ll take it as an apology. No more ruining the magic, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed dramatically, then nodded. </p><p>Letting out a satisfied hum, Phil dropped his hand from Dan\u2019s mouth and looking around at their surroundings. His eyes landed on the gift shop for Winnie the Pooh, and he immediately started pulling Dan towards it. \u201cI just had the best idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like where you\u2019re going with this, love, the look on your face screams mischief,\u201d Dan said warily.</p><p><i>Did I just call him \u201clove\u201d? Oh shit, it is definitely too soon for pet names like that. Shit, that was too much.</i></p><p>But Phil didn\u2019t comment on it. If anything, his smile got wider as he mercilessly tugged Dan along. </p><p>\u201cShh, trust me! This will be amazing, I promise.\u201d Phil sounded particularly excited about this idea of his. </p><p>When they entered the shop, Phil made straight for the back wall. He let go of Dan\u2019s hand to pick up two Mickey Mouse ear hats, one Tigger and one Pooh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m buying these and we\u2019ll match for the rest of the day,\u201d Phil declared adamantly, sounding like he\u2019d already made up his mind.</p><p>Dan blinked in shock, glancing quickly from Phil to the hats and back again. \u201cUm, what? Phil, those are, like, $30 each. I can\u2019t let you get them for both of us on a date I asked you to, that would be ungentlemanly!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>Phil giggled. \u201cYou think I care about that? You\u2019ve already been such a gentleman so far. You bought lunch and everything! Besides, <i>I</i> want to get them. It was my idea, anyway, it\u2019s only right I pay for them. Plus, you\u2019re forgetting that we get a cast member discount, silly. Come on, please?\u201d Phil stuck out his bottom lip and opened his eyes wider in a puppy pout. </p><p>Dan hesitated, momentarily distracted by how endearing that expression was, before contemplating the issue at hand. He didn\u2019t want to push it too much and make it seem like he thought Phil couldn\u2019t afford the hats or something, but he also didn\u2019t want to make Phil pay for them. </p><p><i>Although, he\u2019s right - it was his idea. Surely he wouldn\u2019t have suggested it if he wasn\u2019t willing and expecting to pay for them\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d Dan relented. \u201cYou can buy us the hats, but I\u2019m buying dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already paid for lunch, though!\u201d Phil exclaimed with a tone. \u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to treat you,\u201d Dan mumbled sheepishly, tugging gently on Phil\u2019s hand. He looked up at Phil through his lashes as he continued, \u201cI want you to feel special today, you know? This should all be about you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s free hand reached up and brushed some of Phil\u2019s drooping quiff off his forehead, eventually resting his hand on Phil\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Phil nuzzled into Dan\u2019s hand slightly, looking a little conflicted for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, alright then, if you insist. You can pay for dinner later. But right now, I\u2019m going to get these hats and make everyone jealous of our relationship,\u201d Phil announced with a flare.</p><p><i>Relationship? Does that mean he wants to be boyfriends? Is it too early for that? I mean\u2026 I think I want that, but does he? I know we\u2019re still only on the first date, but this feels so </i>natural<i> that it would just make sense to make it official, wouldn\u2019t it? </i></p><p>Dan decided to tuck the questions away for now, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat as he followed closely behind Phil to the registers.</p><p>Phil quickly paid and picked up the hats from the counter, turning to face Dan.</p><p>\u201cAlright, then, let\u2019s see it on you. May I?\u201d Phil asked, gesturing towards Dan\u2019s head with the Pooh hat and smiling.</p><p><i>My hair is going to hate this\u2026</i></p><p>Dan leaned forward in answer, presenting his head for Phil. Phil slowly fixed the hat over Dan\u2019s head, placing the chin strap under his chin to secure it in place. He reached up and messed with his hair, carefully pulling out a few strands from under the hat. Usually, Dan wouldn\u2019t let anyone fix his hair for him because he alone knew how to make it look good, but he didn\u2019t complain as Phil fluffed the exposed ends. Somehow, he felt like he could trust Phil to do it right. After a lingering moment, Phil pulled his hands away, and Dan tilted his head back up so Phil could inspect the results.</p><p>He inhaled sharply and stared at Dan with an unreadable expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Does it look weird?\u201d Dan asked, suddenly nervous. He took out his phone to use the camera as a mirror. </p><p>It actually wasn\u2019t too bad; his hair was definitely more of a mess now, but he actually looked fairly good with the hat.</p><p>Dan looked back up to see Phil still staring at him, now with a beaming smile.</p><p>Dan blushed at the attention, and Phil cooed.</p><p>\u201cI knew this would be a good idea. You look fantastic,\u201d Phil assured Dan, reaching up a hand again and gently brushing his fingers through the visible floof of hair poking out from under the hat. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan mumbled, feeling the blush continue to burn on his cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiled brightly at him, then dropped his hand from Dan\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Phil thrust the Tigger hat towards Dan\u2019s hand, then tilted his head down so Dan could put the hat on him.</p><p>Dan stretched the elastic over Phil\u2019s chin and pushed the hat back onto Phil\u2019s head. He brushed his fingers through Phil\u2019s quiff to make sure his hair wouldn\u2019t look weird, marvelling at the softness for a moment, then removed his hands.</p><p>Phil\u2019s head tilted back up, and he was grinning, and his face was <i>so close</i> to Dan\u2019s that, for a moment, Dan\u2019s brain short-circuited.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil giggled.</p><p>The giggle was enough to pull Dan\u2019s brain back together in a flurry of thoughts.</p><p><i>Great, my cheeks are going to be permanently pink around Phil, apparently</i>.<i> It doesn\u2019t help that he looks unfairly pretty in that Tigger hat with his stupid gorgeous quiff poking out just a little and he looks so excited and happy and wait what did he say again? Was I supposed to respond? Oh yeah -</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Dan awkwardly said a few beats too late.</p><p>Phil giggled again, not seeming to care about Dan\u2019s awkwardness, then reached into his pocket for his phone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a selfie, immortalize the moment,\u201d Phil suggested.</p><p><i>Oh my god, yes. We are too cute, and I need a picture of Phil looking like this so I can look back on this moment and absolutely melt. He looks so happy.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it, if you want. I\u2019ve mastered the perfect selfie angle with my noodle arms,\u201d Dan joked, stepping closer to Phil.</p><p>Dan expected Phil to just stand next to him, but apparently Phil was in the mood to murder Dan because he stood closer than he really had to for the picture and then reached out an arm to wrap it around Dan\u2019s waist.</p><p>Dan\u2019s selfie arm faltered briefly at the sensation of Phil\u2019s warm arm on his body. He barely bit back a surprised squeak, since he knew that would make Phil think he was uncomfortable and he\u2019d move his arm. That was the last thing Dan wanted. Phil\u2019s half-embrace felt so strong and comforting and <i>safe</i>, Dan wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to survive when Phil eventually moved.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Dan asked, voice a little shaky.</p><p>\u201cYee!\u201d Phil replied.</p><p>Dan snapped a few photos, changing the angle slightly to try to capture the perfect shot. Normally, for a picture like this, he would give a half-smile, or maybe a smirk, but right now? There was no way he could keep the ridiculous grin from his face.</p><p>And then Phil turned his head and kissed Dan right on the cheek as Dan snapped a picture. Dan\u2019s eyes widened and his mouth dropped open in shock.</p><p><i>Did he just - he\u2019s still - oh my god. Oh my </i>GOD. <i>Okay, okay, okay, shhhhh, calm down before he gets weird about it, come on, get it together, Dan.</i></p><p>A flaming red blush spread across Dan\u2019s cheeks and his mouth spread in a face-splitting grin for the last few pictures Dan took. Butterflies zoomed around his stomach like they were trying to escape, and a few seemed to find their way out as giggles. A few of the giggles erupted from Dan\u2019s throat, and he covered his mouth with his hand to prevent any more from escaping</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t sure what to say as Phil pulled away from his cheek. He wasn\u2019t even sure where to <i>look</i>. He could still feel Phil\u2019s strong arm around his waist, and it made thinking difficult. His thoughts swirled wildly as he tried to figure out what to do. Should he look at Phil and let him see how Dan was still reeling? Should he run away? Should he act like nothing happened and look at the pictures? And would he ever stop grinning like a madman?</p><p>He opted for sending Phil a shy, happy glance, then pretending like nothing had happened (which was a little hard to do around his grin, but he tried to ignore that detail). He cleared his throat and looked at his phone, opening the photos app and scrolling through the selfies he took.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably at least one good one in here,\u201d Dan said to distract himself. He looked through the pictures, quickly skimming past the ones where Phil was kissing him to find the first photos.</p><p>\u201cWait - Phil! You\u2019re not even looking at the phone in any of these!\u201d Dan exclaimed, looking over at his date in mock irritation.</p><p>Phil was already looking at him with a fond smile. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not looking at the phone. How could I, when you\u2019re here in front of me?\u201d he asked softly. His face was open and honest, and the fond smile twitched until it grew into a full grin.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks darkened again. He opened his mouth to respond, but all that came out was a sort of strangled, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, his tongue poking through his teeth.</p><p><i>How does he keep getting more and more adorable, oh my god</i>. <i>This man will be the death of me.</i></p><p>Phil\u2019s arm dropped from around Dan\u2019s waist, much to Dan\u2019s disappointment.</p><p>\u201cCome on! We\u2019ve got more rides to go on!\u201d Phil reminded him gleefully. </p><p>He quickly re-discovered Dan\u2019s hand (making butterflies zoom around in his stomach again) and began pulling him out of the shop again, already going on about how he wanted to go on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad again.</p><p>Dan shook his head fondly, but followed Phil anyway.</p><p>A few hours later, they had ridden all Phil\u2019s favorites another time as well as the Winnie the Pooh ride, this time with their Pooh and Tigger ear hats, and they realized they were both starving.</p><p>They meandered over to Pinocchio\u2019s Village Haus for a quick dinner (Phil got chicken nuggets, which Dan found endearing as hell), and then headed back out for a few more roller coasters before they had to find a spot for the fireworks.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I know you love the roller coasters, but we really have to go pick our place to watch the fireworks!\u201d Dan laughed, tugging Phil\u2019s arm to get him to stay out of the line for the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> ride. \u201cBesides, we\u2019ve already been on this one three times. Haven\u2019t you had enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can never have too many pirates, Pooh!\u201d Phil exclaimed excitedly. He tugged right back on Dan\u2019s arm in a desperate attempt to return to the <i>Pirates</i> ride.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes in exasperation. \u201cBut the whole point of coming here was to show you the fireworks!\u201d He stuck out his bottom lip in a pout and batted his eyes at Phil. \u201cPwease, Phiw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwww, now that\u2019s just cheating,\u201d Phil whined. He pouted in return, but Dan wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>Dan jutted his bottom lip out even further, and Phil cracked.</p><p>\u201cOh, alright then,\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cLead the way.\u201d </p><p>A smug grin made its way onto Dan\u2019s lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Follow me, my liege,\u201d Dan said with a mock bow. He took a great deal of joy in the soft giggle he heard Phil make.</p><p>When Phil had agreed to the date, Dan had immediately made sure to reserve them a spot in front of Cinderella\u2019s Castle, where the view would be best. They headed to that area now, waiting for an attendant to allow them into the reserved section directly in front of the castle.</p><p>Even though it was still light out, there was a long line of people waiting to get into the reserved area, so Dan and Phil took their place at the back and hunkered down to wait.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do the fireworks come from, again? Like, which way should I be looking?\u201d Phil asked, inspecting the area around them as if he expected a firework to go off any moment.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole song and show and everything that\u2019ll be around the Castle,\u201d Dan told him. </p><p>Phil nodded absentmindedly, still looking around the park. </p><p>Dan took the quiet moment to appreciate the memories of the day. He thought about how excited Phil had been that morning, and how happy Phil had been when he learned that Dan loved Winnie the Pooh, and how insistent Phil was about the Winnie the Pooh-themed hats they were both still wearing. Dan thought about how <i>good</i> and <i>right</i> the whole day had felt, with the never-ending conversation and playful flirting and hand-holding. <i>God</i>, the <i>handholding</i>. He couldn\u2019t get enough of the feeling of his hand gently clutched by Phil\u2019s. Sometimes, Phil would run his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles, sending all coherent thought flying desperately from his brain and attracting all the blood to his cheeks, making it painfully obvious how much he <i>adored</i> Phil\u2019s actions. </p><p>As they waited for the fireworks, Dan tentatively moved his own thumb over Phil\u2019s hand, wondering if Phil would have a similar reaction to Dan. The blinding smile Phil sent Dan told him that yes, Phil liked that just as much as Dan.</p><p>Phil took a small step in so their sides were entirely pressed up against each other, then leaned in to be even closer.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil whispered with a light smile. \u201cToday\u2019s been great.\u201d</p><p>Dan beamed. The whole goal of the day had been to make Phil as happy as possible. He was proud to say that he firmly believed he had accomplished that goal, and they hadn\u2019t even seen the fireworks yet.</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen the fireworks yet. That was supposed to be the great part of the day,\u201d Dan reminded him.</p><p>Phil laughed gently, reaching up his free hand to carefully cup Dan\u2019s cheek. Dan\u2019s heartbeat quickened as he subconsciously leaned into the touch.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dan,\u201d Phil sighed happily. \u201cThe great part was spending time with you, no matter what we did.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s thumb caressed Dan\u2019s cheek, and Dan\u2019s brain shorted out.</p><p><i>He- I- Great? My face? His hand? My god.</i></p><p>Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, all Dan could think to say was a breathy, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s responding laugh brushed delicately against Dan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSpeechless, Howell? That\u2019s surprising,\u201d he teased. \u201cI like seeing you all flustered. I\u2019ll have to keep making it happen.\u201d He winked at Dan in his special Phil way, where it\u2019s more of a blink than a wink, then let go of Dan entirely and turned towards the line, which had finally moved forward to allow people into the reserved section.</p><p>Dan blinked in surprise. </p><p><i>What just happened? I didn\u2019t even notice the line move. What is this boy </i>doing<i> to me?</i></p><p>He shook himself slightly, quickly catching up to Phil and re-clasping their hands.</p><p><i>Should I address what just happened? What would I even say? I\u2019m not sure I know what happened, anyway. </i></p><p>Dan chanced a glance at Phil and saw a smirk playing at his lips.</p><p><i>That\u2019s a dangerous smirk. He looks mischievous - he\u2019s way too pleased with himself. It\u2019s probably best if I just move on, before I make more of a fool of myself.</i></p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d he began, louder than he expected. He winced internally, begging himself to be less awkward. Clearing his throat, he tried again, lowering his voice to a normal volume this time. \u201cSo, are you ready to see the most beautiful, captivating thing you will ever see?\u201d</p><p>A full smirk formed on Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen him. He\u2019s actually somehow letting me hold his hand,\u201d he said teasingly, swinging their hands pointedly.</p><p>Dan groaned, looking towards the heavens as if asking for God to come save him from this dork, but he couldn\u2019t disguise his smile, nor his accompanying blush. \u201cOh, <i>that</i> was cheesy as hell. I walked right into it, too, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He looked back at Phil with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly did.\u201d Phil grinned, bumping Dan\u2019s shoulder with his own. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re all blushy again, how adorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace. A danger to society. Too pure for this world,\u201d Dan deadpanned.</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cOne of these things is not like the other.\u201d</p><p>In a sing-song voice, Dan replied, \u201cBut all of them describe you perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Phil bumped Dan\u2019s shoulder again, harder this time. \u201cYour mum\u2019s a description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Dan shrieked out in a hyena laugh. \u201cThat- that doesn\u2019t even make sense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mum doesn\u2019t even-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare finish that sentence,\u201d Dan warned teasingly. \u201cLeave my poor mum alone.\u201d To make sure Phil didn\u2019t take him too seriously, Dan squeezed his hand lightly. If his heart raced a little faster when Phil squeezed back, well, no one had to know.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going to watch the fireworks from?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan hummed in thought, looking around the open area for a good spot. \u201cHow about right there?\u201d He pointed to a place near the front of the section, but far enough back that they wouldn\u2019t block everyone\u2019s line of sight with their tallness.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Phil agreed with a content nod. </p><p>Phil followed Dan to their spot. Once they got there, Dan hugged Phil\u2019s arm with his own free arm and rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Dan looked up at Phil from his shoulder. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d Dan asked. He felt Phil nod. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d came Phil\u2019s fond reply. Phil squeezed Dan\u2019s hand once, then brushed his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles again. </p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been leaning on Phil already, Dan was sure he would\u2019ve fallen over completely in a swoon. Phil somehow knew exactly what to do to make Dan unbelievably happy, and Dan was living for it.</p><p>For a few minutes, they stood in silence, just enjoying each other\u2019s presence and the feeling of their bodies pressed together as they waited for the fireworks. </p><p>The lights around the crowd went out, and Cinderella\u2019s Castle lit up.</p><p>\u201cIs it starting?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan resisted the urge to sass Phil, because <i>honestly, what else could be happening? Disney shut down the park with everyone still in it?</i></p><p>Instead, he hummed quietly in affirmation and snuggled closer into Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Music began, and the crowd was entranced. Oohs and Ahhs rang out in the plaza with every new animation and special effect. The lights and the music, combined with the magical experience that is spending a day at Disney World, always delivered a spectacular performance.</p><p>But Dan wasn\u2019t really paying attention. </p><p>Dan was looking at Phil. Well, some would call it <i>staring</i>, but Dan couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. </p><p>Phil\u2019s expression was so relaxed, so <i>happy</i>. Every new piece to the show had him gasping in delight, a childlike wonder in his eyes. Dan couldn\u2019t get enough of it.</p><p>And then Phil seemed to notice that Dan wasn\u2019t watching the fireworks. He turned his head slightly, looking at Dan, who was still carefully resting on his shoulder despite the Pooh ears.</p><p>Normally, Dan would\u2019ve been embarrassed to be caught staring, but all he could feel was an overwhelming affection for the man who had spent the whole day trying to make sure Dan had a good time, even though Dan was meant to be treating Phil. </p><p>A fond smile grew on Phil\u2019s face as he and Dan got lost in each other\u2019s gaze. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil whispered just loud enough to be heard over the fireworks and music. His free hand moved up and carded through Dan\u2019s exposed fringe slowly, then came to rest on his cheek. His thumb delicately traced Dan\u2019s cheekbone. </p><p>If he could, Dan would have purred at the gentle motion of Phil\u2019s thumb. Instead, he sighed through his nose and leaned into the touch with a smile. He trailed his fingers along Phil\u2019s forearm, appreciating how Phil shivered at the sensation. \u201cHi.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes quickly flickered over Dan\u2019s face, and his smile grew. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty,\u201d he stated simply, as if it were just a fact that the whole world should know.</p><p>Dan turned to hide his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder in embarrassment. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just say things like that,\u201d he whined. \u201cThey do weird things to me and make me feel all soft.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand moved from caressing Dan\u2019s face to rest comfortingly on Dan\u2019s waist. \u201cBut it\u2019s true! And I love seeing you blush when I tell you so.\u201d Phil wiggled his elbow. \u201cCome on, let me see your pretty face.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling false complaints, Dan slowly lifted his head to look Phil in the eye.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Phil whispered adoringly. He shifted his hand up from Dan\u2019s waist to gently cup his face, stroking his cheekbone with his thumb.</p><p>Dan felt his blush intensify and looked away for a moment to try to regain his composure. When he finally felt ready to look at Phil again, he found that Phil\u2019s gaze moving slowly over his face, taking in every detail.</p><p>It was a whole new feeling. Dan had realized throughout the day that, yes, Phil did actually kind of like him, but the way Phil looked at him now was so much <i>more</i> - more even than just moments before. This was an intense gaze, which intimidated Dan a little, but mostly he was just overwhelmed with happiness at the brilliant realization that Phil <i>liked him</i>. Dan felt wanted in a way that stretched beyond just the physical, and he was overcome with emotion.</p><p>His eyes could no longer stay still on Phil\u2019s. They trailed over his features, just as Phil\u2019s were doing to him, and took in the sharp cheekbones, the beaked nose, the freckles and spots, the way his pink lips contrasted his pale skin. And then all he could look at were Phil\u2019s lips. Their soft curve into Phil\u2019s small half-smile, the way they pouted out slightly. They looked soft. Kissable.</p><p><i>Are they as soft as they look? Would he kiss me if I asked?</i></p><p>Dan somehow managed to pull his eyes up from Phil\u2019s mouth to see his eyes instead. He wanted to know what Phil was thinking and know if he had any chance.</p><p>Phil was still looking at Dan\u2019s face, but it seemed his sights were stuck on Dan\u2019s mouth. Dan felt a shiver course through him when he thought of what Phil might be thinking. His shiver seemed to jolt Phil out of his thoughts, as his eyes snapped up to meet Dan\u2019s.</p><p>They stood still. Dan\u2019s thoughts were caught in a constant loop of <i>kiss me, kiss me, kiss me</i> as he tried to work up the courage to ask, but he wasn\u2019t sure he could bring himself to say the words. </p><p><i>Come on, just ask! You want to, and he seems like he wants to, and you just have to go for it. Just say it. He won\u2019t say no. But what if he does? What if I\u2019ve been reading the whole situation wrong?</i></p><p>As Dan\u2019s internal crisis continued, Phil took a small step forward, eliminating the last traces of space between their bodies. Phil\u2019s lips remained ever so slightly apart, like he wasn\u2019t sure he had Dan\u2019s permission.</p><p>Emboldened by Phil\u2019s move, Dan made a decision. Slowly, his eyelids fluttered closed, and he leaned in the smallest bit so their lips brushed.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand on Dan\u2019s cheek slid back into his hair, just below the edge of the Pooh hat, and brushed his fingers through the curls. Dan sighed into the kiss, and Phil\u2019s lips moved softly against Dan\u2019s. </p><p>It was a little tentative, and their noses bumped together awkwardly at first, but it felt right. They kept it slow and purposeful, just exploring the feeling of each other. Dan wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever had such a perfect first kiss, and he drowned in the sensation.</p><p>They pulled apart not too long after the kiss began. Bashful smiles grew on their faces as their eyes opened, and Dan bit his lip in an attempt to keep from grinning too much. Phil\u2019s tongue poked between his teeth a little, and Dan\u2019s heart melted. </p><p>Phil\u2019s fingers disentangled from Dan\u2019s, and Dan panicked.</p><p><i>He doesn\u2019t want to hold my hand anymore? What did I do wrong? Did he hate the kiss? But then why did he smile? What no-</i></p><p>Dan\u2019s thoughts were cut off by the feeling of Phil\u2019s now-free arm wrapping around Dan\u2019s shoulder and pulling him in to cuddle into Phil\u2019s side. Phil\u2019s other hand found Dan\u2019s again, and he clasped them in front of their bodies. </p><p><i>Oh.</i> Dan giggled. <i>That\u2019s better, then.</i></p><p>He rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder, careful to tip his head far enough backwards that he wouldn\u2019t dig his Pooh ears into Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p><i>This is the best first date </i>ever<i>.</i></p><p>They had missed most of the fireworks just staring at each other and kissing, but they caught the grand finale. Phil periodically made small noises of wonder and amazement that Dan wished he could bottle up and keep forever.</p><p>Too soon, the fireworks ended. Phil turned to Dan with a tired, but happy, smile, which Dan returned.</p><p>They made their way back through the crowd and to the parking lot, still hand-in-hand. It was a bit of a long walk, given the number of people trying to leave and the crazy distance from the park to the parking lot, but they were content to walk it in silence. The silence was comfortable, like a warm hug or a soft kiss. Dan wished the moment never had to end.</p><p>They eventually made it to Dan\u2019s car. Dan held the door open for Phil and shut it behind him, then went to open his own door and sit down behind the wheel.</p><p>Phil let out a deep, happy sigh. \u201cThat was really fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I had a really good time,\u201d Dan sighed happily as he started the car. He didn\u2019t move the car yet, though. Instead, he sat back in his seat and looked over at Phil with a small smile.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand crept forward and caught Dan\u2019s over the middle console, squeezing gently. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you missed some of the fireworks, though. That was kind of the whole reason we came,\u201d Dan said plainly, like he felt like it had to be said. He wasn\u2019t sorry at all, actually, as what made Phil miss the fireworks was infinitely better than the fireworks themselves. He was also fairly certain Phil wasn\u2019t too bothered by it, but he felt like it had to be said, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not. But, hey, that gives us something to do next time,\u201d Phil said casually, looking over at Dan, the ghost of a smile playing at his lips.</p><p>It took Dan\u2019s brain a moment to process Phil\u2019s words</p><p>\u201cNext time?\u201d he asked hopefully, a wide grin spreading across his face. <i>Please, this was amazing</i>.</p><p>\u201cYep. Maybe we\u2019ll go to Epcot to see those fireworks, instead.\u201d Phil smirked. \u201cOr maybe we\u2019ll miss those, too.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart skipped a bit and red flooded his cheeks.</p><p><i>Fuck. He wants to kiss me more? He wants to do this again. Oh my god.</i></p><p>Laughter outside the car jolted Dan out of his thoughts. A family walked past, and Dan watched them find their car. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better start driving home.\u201d </p><p>He put the car in gear and moved them towards the line of cars trying to leave the park. Phil started talking about his favorite funny moments of the day, and Dan chimed in with a few Phil missed. Phil also insisted that Dan tell him he was right about the Pooh hats. </p><p>\u201cThey were the most important thing. They completed the whole picture. You\u2019re the one always going on and on about aesthetics! There\u2019s no way you think they weren\u2019t the best idea ever,\u201d Phil argued playfully. He had a smug grin on his face and he poked Dan\u2019s arm a few times to drive his point home.</p><p><i>God, he\u2019s cute. He </i>so<i> wants me to agree with him, but I can\u2019t give up that easily</i>, Dan thought mischievously. A smirk formed on his face as he started to rile Phil up about it.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he drawled. \u201cWinnie the Pooh doesn\u2019t fit my aesthetic, especially not right now. Yellow ears with this pink and blue shirt? Major clashing goin\u2019 on here. I definitely look ridiculous.\u201d Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Phil\u2019s jaw drop in mock outrage. Dan\u2019s smirk grew as his plan succeeded.</p><p>\u201cWinnie the Pooh fits <i>everyone\u2019s</i> aesthetic! There\u2019s never a wrong time to wear Pooh ears, and looking ridiculous is the best part of it! Plus, we looked so cute together that it had to have been worth it,\u201d Phil declared indignantly.</p><p>\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d Dan hummed thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose we were a little cute, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Phil squawked. \u201cA <i>little</i>? Only a <i>little</i>? I\u2019ll have you know we were <i>definitely</i> the cutest people anyone saw at the Magic Kingdom <i>all day</i>,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEveryone was jealous of us.\u201d He crossed his arms with a huff, shooting Dan a sour glare. \u201cIt was the <i>best</i> idea.\u201d</p><p>Dan finally couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter anymore, letting it out in a loud burst absolutely <i>drenched</i> in fondness. He reached a hand out and pried Phil\u2019s arms apart so he could hold Phil\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you, Phil! I loved the hats and the cute couple aesthetic and how jealous we made everyone else. They <i>were</i> the best idea.\u201d He chanced a glance over at Phil, who had finally relaxed back into his seat after tensely arguing his points. Dan sent him an affectionate smile. \u201cThank you. They made my day. Well,\u201d he added after a beat, \u201cmaybe not <i>quite</i>. The fireworks would be hard to beat.\u201d</p><p>Phil blushed heavily, biting his lip to hide a grin. \u201cGood. Great. The hats and the\u2026 <i>fireworks</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled their clasped hands to his face and pressed a delicate kiss to the back of Phil\u2019s hand, delighting in the quiet giggle it tugged from Phil, then let go of Phil\u2019s hand to put his hand back on the steering wheel.</p><p>After a few minutes of companionable silence, they moved on to talking about their jobs and why they worked at Disney, describing the incomparable feeling of bringing the magical joy to everyone who visited. Somehow, these conversations led them all the way back to Phil\u2019s house. Dan wasn\u2019t sure where the time went, but he wished it would come back.</p><p>He pulled over in front of Phil\u2019s house and put the car in park, resting his hand on the middle console.</p><p><i>I really don\u2019t want this to end.</i></p><p>Apparently Phil didn\u2019t want it to end either, as he made no move to get up. He just sat, staring at his house for a moment, then he turned to Dan.</p><p>\u201cI really did have a great time,\u201d he said quietly, reaching out to play with Dan\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Dan smiled softly, meeting Phil\u2019s gaze. \u201cMe too,\u201d he whispered fondly. He moved his hand slightly so it was holding Phil\u2019s, and he squeezed gently.</p><p>\u201cThanks for treating me. It was sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks flushed, and he looked down. \u201cYou deserve to feel special,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Soft fingers brushed against Dan\u2019s jaw, carefully raising his face so he would look at Phil.</p><p><i>Phil\u2019s so beautiful. How did I even get here? </i></p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Phil whispered. \u201cSo, if it\u2019s okay with you, <i>I\u2019ll</i> take <i>you</i> out next time.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded slowly. He was completely speechless with happiness. Phil had just confirmed that this would happen again, and Dan was thrilled and just a bit overwhelmed, especially with how Phil\u2019s hand caressed his cheek and how close Phil\u2019s face was to his. </p><p>And then Phil\u2019s face came even closer, and Dan\u2019s eyes closed as their lips touched.</p><p>It was a soft and sweet kiss, shorter than the ones earlier that night, and it left Dan wanting more as Phil pulled away.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Phil whispered, his breath fanning across Dan\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Dan replied softly, his eyes locked on Phil\u2019s. He wished the night didn\u2019t have to end, that he could spend more time with Phil, but he didn\u2019t push it. Maybe a different night, but not right now. The rest of their day had already been perfect, anyway.</p><p>Phil smiled, then turned and got out of the car, quickly walking up the walkway to his house.</p><p>Dan stared after him in a daze, reaching up and touching his lips with his fingers. He let out a lovestruck sigh, then smiled wide as he started to drive back home.</p><p>A memory came to him as he drove, and he smiled, then laughed.</p><p>He definitely didn\u2019t need to worry about some six-year-old coming and stealing his Phil away.</p>",

How his heart hadn\u2019t yet fallen out of his ass from the sheer power of emotion, Dan wasn\u2019t sure. Phil was literally Dan\u2019s ideal man. And Phil had agreed to go on a date with him. As excited as Dan was, he was equally filled with anxiety at everything that could go wrong.</p><p><i>Don\u2019t fuck it up, Dan</i>.</p><p>On the drive over to Phil\u2019s house, Dan worried that he had somehow gotten the wrong address, or that his phone\u2019s GPS had sent him the wrong way, or that he\u2019d be late to pick Phil up, or that Phil would have already left his house and moved back to England.</p><p>It was ridiculous, honestly, but Dan couldn\u2019t help it. He <i>really</i> wanted this date to work out.</p><p>Every red light added to his stress. He kept glancing at the little clock in his car, watching the minutes pass. He was supposed to pick Phil up at 7am sharp, but the time ticked closer and closer, and Dan felt like he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere closer to Phil\u2019s house anytime soon. His nerves grew with every second that passed, and he found himself chewing on his lip in anticipation. He had done his best to leave his house with time to spare, but now that he was actually en route, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d made it out the door in time. </p><p><i>He\u2019ll be so disappointed if I\u2019m late. Dan the Fuck-Up, as usual, can\u2019t even be bothered to make it to a date on time. Classic- </i></p><p>\u201cArrived,\u201d said the mechanical voice on Dan\u2019s phone, interrupting Dan\u2019s spiral of thoughts. </p><p>Dan pulled over in front of a small house. It looked like it might have been white, but Dan couldn\u2019t be sure in the faint early morning light.</p><p>He anxiously checked the clock again. It was 7:06.</p><p><i>Bloody typical.</i></p><p>Phil had told Dan to text when he arrived, saying it would be easier than knocking on the door and waking up Phil\u2019s housemates and suffering their persistent teasing. Dan didn\u2019t waste any time grabbing his phone from the passenger\u2019s seat and texting Phil. He didn\u2019t want Phil to have to wait any longer than he already had.</p><p><b>Dan:</b> im here</p><p>Phil\u2019s response came within seconds, startling Dan.</p><p><i>He responded so fast, he must have been waiting. Dammit, Dan, why are you always late?! He\u2019s probably mad about it.</i></p><p>He took a deep breath and opened the message.</p><p><b>Phil:<i> </i></b>gr8 gimme 2 secs i\u2019ll b right there</p><p>Dan let out the breath he had been holding. Phil wasn\u2019t mad. At least, Dan assumed so, since Phil said he was coming. </p><p>Nervously, Dan\u2019s hands began dancing and tapping randomly on the steering wheel of his car.  </p><p><i>He\u2019s coming. Oh my god, the date is about to start. Oh my god. </i></p><p>He looked outside the window, anxiously watching the door of the house- but then he looked away to look at the road because watching the door meant actively waiting for Phil to exit his house, which was stressful in itself because it made him think about how much time was passing and how much time Phil had to change his mind and decide not to come on the date after all.</p><p><i>This date has to be </i>perfect<i>. If it\u2019s not perfect, he won\u2019t want to go on another date and you\u2019ll end up alone and sad. </i></p><p>Dan noticed his leg was bouncing erratically from the nerves and forced himself to take a breath.</p><p><i>It\u2019ll be okay. He wanted to go with you this time, so he clearly must like </i>something<i> about you. Just chill out.</i></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the house opened and Phil stepped out, turning and locking it behind him.</p><p>The nerves struck Dan again as Phil approached, manifesting in even more intense finger tapping. Phil\u2019s hair was quiffed up off his forehead, and Dan ached to run his fingers through it. He wore a red plaid shirt, well-fitted to his broad shoulders and making his biceps pop. His black skinny jeans had rips in the knees, giving him a bit of an edgy aesthetic that Dan knew didn\u2019t reflect Phil\u2019s true nerdy, kind personality. Dan was intimidated as hell by Phil\u2019s appearance. How could he look so put-together this early in the morning?? It literally was not fair, and Dan felt inadequate in his own ripped black skinny jeans and cherry blossom button-up. His leg started to vibrate again, and he rolled his eyes at himself.</p><p><i>Get it together, Dan</i>.</p><p>They made eye contact through the windscreen, and Phil flashed Dan one of his absolutely <i>adorable</i> smiles. Dan\u2019s heartbeat picked up even more at the sight, and he managed a small smile in return.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so perfect.</i></p><p>Phil arrived at the passenger door and pulled the handle. The door didn\u2019t open. Phil shot Dan a confused look through the window. His brows were furrowed, and there was a cute little wrinkle in the middle of his forehead. Phil pulled the handle again, then pouted up at Dan. His bottom lip was sticking out, and his eyebrows were lifting.</p><p><i>What? Why isn\u2019t it ope-</i> <i>Oh.</i></p><p>Dan sheepishly flipped the \u201cunlock\u201d switch on the control panel next to his arm, then motioned for Phil to try again. This time, it worked, and Phil slid into the seat with a cheeky smile. </p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were excited for this date,\u201d Phil teased lightheartedly.</p><p><i>Shit! Now he thinks I don\u2019t want this!</i></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Dan exclaimed loudly, eyes wide and hands reaching out as if to grab Phil\u2019s arm and keep him in the car.</p><p>Phil blinked, tilting his head to the side and furrowing his brow. Clearly, Dan had confused him again. </p><p>Dan winced at his own unending awkwardness, then backpedaled to try to salvage the conversation that had <i>barely even begun, god, get it together, Dan</i>. </p><p>\u201cI am <i>really</i> excited for this date, Phil, you have no idea,\u201d he began, refusing to look at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m just also really nervous-\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s giggle interrupted the beginnings of a rant that surely would make Dan feel much worse. \u201cI\u2019m kidding! I know you\u2019re excited,\u201d Phil laughed. </p><p>The fondness in Phil\u2019s voice caused Dan to cautiously look at Phil out of the corner of his eye. </p><p>Sure enough, the fondest of smiles graced Phil\u2019s lips. Dan could feel himself blushing, and he hoped Phil wouldn\u2019t notice (but he was sure the color on his cheeks was glaringly obvious). </p><p>Slowly, Phil reached a tentative hand out to one of Dan\u2019s, gently prying his white-knuckled grasp off the steering wheel to intertwine their fingers. Dan stared at their linked hands in wonder. Phil\u2019s hand was a little smaller and a lot paler, but it looked perfect in Dan\u2019s. Dan felt a clammy warmth coming from Phil\u2019s palm, and he relaxed a little when he realized that must mean that Phil wasn\u2019t feeling as confident as he seemed- at least Dan wasn\u2019t alone in his nerves. </p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s okay that you\u2019re nervous. I\u2019m nervous, too.\u201d Phil leaned in closer to Dan to whisper conspiratorially, \u201cPlus, you\u2019re really cute when you blush.\u201d</p><p>Dan figured that Phil would probably think Dan was \u201creally cute\u201d most of the date, then, because he couldn\u2019t seem to get his cheeks to calm down. If anything, he was pretty sure his cheeks were getting even more red.</p><p>Flustered, Dan didn\u2019t know what to say in response, so he just looked back at the road, shaking his head in slight disbelief.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t know how he could think I\u2019m cute when he\u2019s obviously the cutest person in the universe</i>.</p><p>Dan swallowed nervously. \u201cWe should- uh- get going. The whole point of getting up before daylight was to get there early, right?\u201d Dan said, deciding to ignore Phil\u2019s comment entirely. </p><p>Phil shrugged and leaned back in his seat, releasing Dan\u2019s hand so he could drive.</p><p>He carefully checked that the road was clear before pulling into the lane.</p><p>Although his eyes were trained on the street, Dan could practically <i>feel</i> Phil\u2019s self-satisfied grin. He couldn\u2019t help the blush that just wouldn\u2019t go away, not when he knew Phil was smiling because of him. </p><p><i>That cute bitch. God, I\u2019m a mess.</i></p><p>Phil must have sensed Dan\u2019s current inability to converse like a proper human being, and decided to take pity on him because he took charge of the conversation. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved Disney.\u201d Phil said thoughtfully. \u201cI was definitely that kid who sat inside all day rewatching <i>The Lion King</i> until my parents couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d He chuckled at himself, then continued. \u201cI think they eventually broke the tape on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Dan pictured it - a tiny Phil sat in front of a shitty \u201890s television, dressed in absolutely horrendous \u201890s fashion, and singing along at the top of his lungs. He was probably dreadfully off-key even then. </p><p>He laughed at the mental image, glancing over at Phil as if trying to picture this adult man in the same situation. \u201cThat sounds cute as fuck, Phil,\u201d he said through the laugh.</p><p>\u201cDoes it really?\u201d Phil asked, sounding surprised. \u201dSeems a bit annoying, if you ask me. My parents certainly thought so,\u201d Phil mused.</p><p>Dan shook his head, and snuck another glance at Phil. </p><p>\u201cDefinitely cute as fuck,\u201d Dan adamantly assured Phil. He was almost offended that anyone could be annoyed with Phil. \u201cAnd you know what, <i>The Lion King </i>is amazing, so we are gonna sing it right now, on the way to Disney, because we are adults and no one can stop us,\u201d he declared.</p><p><i>Shit, what if he doesn\u2019t want to, though?</i></p><p>Dan quickly side-eyed Phil, saying, \u201cYou know, if you want, that is. We don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>But Dan\u2019s concern was unnecessary, as Phil was already grinning and pulling out his phone to find the soundtrack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it now, Howell. The offer has been made and there\u2019s no going back,\u201d Phil said just as \u201cThe Circle of Life\u201d began to play from his phone.</p><p>\u201cNaaaaaaans lasagna baby itsy baby!\u201d Phil sang along loudly. He was extremely pitchy, but he didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i>, Phil!\u201d Dan yelled through a hyena laugh. \u201cThose <i>so</i> aren\u2019t the lyrics, oh my <i>god</i>!\u201d </p><p>Phil ignored him and continued to sing, moving to the background chorus \u201clyrics\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama. It\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama.\u201d </p><p>Dan laughed harder, doing his best to keep his attention primarily focused on the road. </p><p><i>He\u2019s having so much fun with this. I bet it\u2019d make him happy if I sing like that, too.</i></p><p>Dan would do pretty much anything to make Phil smile, so he joined in, singing, \u201cIt\u2019s a llama, penguin and a llama\u201d just as loudly and carelessly as Phil.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Dan could see Phil turn his head to look at him. Dan felt himself absolutely <i>melting</i> under the fond giddiness in Phil\u2019s gaze.</p><p><i>Today\u2019s gonna be such a good day.</i></p><p>They spent a majority of the drive singing along to various Disney songs, sticking to <i>The Lion King</i> at first but expanding to some of their other Disney favorites like <i>Mulan </i>(Dan loved singing his dramatic rendition of \u201cReflection\u201d) and <i>The Little Mermaid </i>(they couldn\u2019t <i>not</i>. Phil was Prince Eric, after all). </p><p>\u201cSo, I told you what my favorite Disney movie growing up was, now it\u2019s your turn,\u201d Phil began as the last note of \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d faded away. \u201cWhat did your poor parents have to put up with?\u201d</p><p>Dan blushed, his eyes darting over to glance at Phil. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>Phil scoffed. \u201cImpossible. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s perfectly endearing.\u201d Dan shook his head but Phil continued, sounding almost petulant. \u201cEither way, you have to tell me because I already told you mine.\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but gave in. Phil could probably make him give into anything. \u201cOkay, fine. My favorite Disney cartoon was Winnie the Pooh. It\u2019s lit<i>-tra-</i>ly why I have such a posh accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwwwww, I love Winnie the Pooh!\u201d Phil cooed. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t my favorite, but he was so wonderful.\u201d </p><p>Dan glanced over, surprised by Phil\u2019s enthusiastic reaction. Phil was already staring back at him with a small, fond smile.</p><p>Just as Dan was about to speak up, maybe change the subject because he still felt a bit embarrassed, Phil spoke again. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not all that surprised your favorite was Winnie the Pooh. You kind of remind me of him, in a way,\u201d he said thoughtfully. </p><p>Dan smiled, but couldn\u2019t keep the confusion out of his expression, his head tilting to the side slightly and his eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>\u201cI really remind you of Winnie the Pooh?\u201d Dan asked, baffled.</p><p>In his peripheral vision, Dan caught a glimpse of Phil. Phil was staring out the window like he was deep in thought, scrunching up his eyebrows slightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this kind of calm chillness about you, but I still know you\u2019ll work hard to get what you want. Like, you work for what you care about but still take it easy every now and then, if that makes sense. And you seem to care a lot about your friends, which is very Pooh.\u201d </p><p>There was a thoughtfulness and sincerity to his voice that caught Dan off guard. <i>How does he know that about me already? Does he really pay that much attention?</i> Warmth filled Dan as he considered that maybe Phil liked him as much as he liked Phil.</p><p>But then Phil grinned, continuing cheekily, \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure what you want usually isn\u2019t a pot of honey.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a snort. \u201c<i>Most</i> of that was actually very perceptive of you,\u201d he replied fondly, glancing over at Phil with a soft smile. </p><p>Phil shrugged. \u201cNo, not really. It\u2019s not that hard to recognize that you\u2019ve never taken a pot of honey to work,\u201d he tried to say casually, but he couldn\u2019t quite keep the amusement from his voice.</p><p>Dan groaned and rolled his eyes, but he laughed affectionately. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dork!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s a dork!\u201d Phil retorted in a faux-defensive tone.</p><p>\u201cOi, you leave my mum out of this!\u201d Dan laughed, reaching over to poke Phil\u2019s leg.</p><p>The conversation dissolved into laughter and more meaningless, but fun, banter. Dan lost track of the time, his brain in autopilot as he drove them the rest of the way to Disney, and he found himself almost sad when they arrived. The drive had gone so well, what if things got awkward when they were wandering around?</p><p>Dan\u2019s worry didn\u2019t last long, however, as Phil continued to talk just as he had in the car. As they walked into the park, they made a quick list of rides they <i>had</i> to go on, and then they were off.</p><p>Creepy dolls sang \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d to them (Phil regretted that suggestion; he told Dan he definitely gave himself nightmare material for weeks), they journeyed through the Caribbean with cunning pirates to find Spanish gold, and they took a tour through Neverland. Each ride had a long enough line that they could talk for a short while, but they didn\u2019t feel like they were wasting the day just waiting around.</p><p>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was definitely Phil\u2019s favorite. He made Dan go on it three times in a row. And because Phil just looked too adorable when he was excited (his eyes lit up as he smiled and bounced on the balls of his feet, insisting they had to <i>go go go again right now, it\u2019s so fun!</i>), Dan couldn\u2019t say no. Plus, it was kind of a small cart and they were rather tall. Dan wasn\u2019t about to give up the chance to be squished into Phil\u2019s side.</p><p>They wandered into Liberty Square for lunch. Dan had timed it perfectly, because it was just before a parade was supposed to begin. He thought Phil might enjoy seeing the characters and hearing the music as a guest rather than an employee for once, since he was always so excited about the magic of Disney. Dan <i>loved</i> it when the magic would excite Phil; Phil\u2019s inner child would shine through, lighting up his face and making him giggle in wonder.</p><p>\u201cWe <i>have</i> to go to Sleepy Hollow,\u201d Dan insisted as he pointed to the restaurant with one hand, excitedly tapping Phil\u2019s arm with his other. \u201cThey have the best damn chicken and waffles you will ever have in your life, and there\u2019s a little picnic area so we can watch the parade go by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a pancakes man, to be honest,\u201d Phil said dubiously. \u201cBut I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d He flashed Dan a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cThese are so much more than a breakfast food, Phil, they are <i>art</i>. They make sandwiches out of the waffle and put this spicy chicken inside and-\u201d Dan moaned theatrically- \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, it\u2019s just <i>so good</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, lead the way!\u201d Phil conceded, and gestured for Dan to go ahead of him. Dan reached behind him and pulled Phil after him by the forearm as he hurriedly made his way into the restaurant.</p><p>Phil let Dan pick his waffle for him, and then took out his wallet to pay.</p><p>\u201cHey, no, put that away!\u201d Dan insisted, pushing Phil\u2019s arm down. \u201cI asked you out, so I\u2019m paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d Phil started, his hand still reaching into his wallet.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Dan lightly hip-checked Phil out of the way and handed his card over to the cashier. \u201cI\u2019ve got this, okay?\u201d He turned to look at Phil again to see him rolling his eyes, which worried him until he noticed Phil\u2019s small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous, but okay.\u201d Phil gave Dan\u2019s shoulder a mini shove to retaliate for the hip-check.</p><p>A few minutes later, they retrieved the waffles and sat down at a table near the edge of the patio so they could see the parade when it came.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for your life to change dramatically?\u201d Dan asked seriously as they each picked up their waffle sandwiches.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019m a little scared. That\u2019s a lot of pressure riding on this one sandwich,\u201d Phil teased. He eyed the sandwich skeptically, eyes narrowed in distrust.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s deserved, believe me,\u201d Dan said. \u201cCome on, then. I\u2019m waiting for your reaction.\u201d Dan leaned in closer and stared at Phil eagerly, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil eyed his sandwich with a curious expression - part wary and part excited - before he leaned in, opened his mouth wide, and took a big bite. </p><p>He seemed to consider for a moment, and then his eyes widened comically. He looked at Dan with pure wonder on his face. His lips were tilting up into a smile, even though his mouth was full of food.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dan said, nodding seriously.</p><p>\u201cHow - it\u2019s - oh my god,\u201d Phil groaned around his bite of food.</p><p>\u201cI <i>know</i>,\u201d Dan laughed. He leaned back in his seat, relieved at Phil\u2019s reaction. \u201cYou like it, then?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded vigorously, already going in for another bite.</p><p>Dan laughed again, then took a bite of his own sandwich and moaned at the flavor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really spicy but it\u2019s so good,\u201d Phil managed when he finally swallowed. He chugged a few gulps of water, then dove back into the sandwich.</p><p>Dan felt a strange sense of pride well up in him. Phil had trusted Dan\u2019s suggestion and it paid off <i>brilliantly</i>. </p><p>Just then, the front of the parade passed by their seating area. The magic of seeing the characters wasn\u2019t as strong for Dan or Phil now that they\u2019ve done parades and meet and greets before, but that didn\u2019t stop them from enjoying it. Mickey Mouse waved at them, and Phil squealed in delight.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mickey!\u201d he called excitedly, bouncing in his seat a bit and waving his arm wildly.</p><p><i>He\u2019s so precious, oh my god</i>.</p><p>\u201cMickey Mouse waved at me, Dan! I feel special,\u201d Phil exclaimed, looking at Dan with the gleeful excitement of a child.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Dan said softly. His body was frozen, his hands half-raised to his mouth with the last few bites of his waffle sandwich, but his eyes wandered Phil\u2019s face, taking in the joy and giddiness. Phil\u2019s happiness was infectious, and Dan found himself smiling affectionately at this excitable man who had somehow agreed to go on a date with <i>Dan</i>, of all people.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face flushed, and he broke eye contact for a moment to look down at his food tray, then cautiously looked back up at Dan through his lashes. Dan felt a fresh surge of affection as he saw how bashful Phil got at the compliment. </p><p>They stared at each other silently for a moment, faces turning redder by the second, until Dan cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, you liked the waffle, then?\u201d He pointed at the sticky mess left on the tray where Phil\u2019s sandwich used to be.</p><p>Phil nodded. \u201cLife-changing, as advertised. Thanks for the suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it,\u201d Dan replied. He cleared his throat again. \u201cSo, after the parade crowd clears out a bit, do you wanna go to the Haunted Mansion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Phil agreed. </p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the crowd to disperse once the parade ended, and then Dan and Phil were off to find the Haunted Mansion.</p><p>On the way, they encountered a traffic jam where some families were apparently meeting a character. A huge crowd of people stood in the way, blocking the whole path. Dan felt a twinge of sympathy for the handler, knowing how hard it could be to keep a crowd under control, especially in walkways. As a handler, he hated when people tried to force their way through, but he was a man on a mission. He\u2019d just try not to be too aggressive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go for it,\u201d Dan decided, already sending mental apologies to the handler. \u201cStay close?\u201d</p><p>Phil nodded, and Dan pushed himself into the small gaps between people with Phil on his heels.</p><p>Except Phil wasn\u2019t quite as on-his-heels as he expected. Dan had moved a little too fast for Phil to keep up in such a cramped space. A hand grasped onto Dan\u2019s wrist, and he jumped, glancing back quickly to see Phil\u2019s arm outstretched. </p><p><i>Phil\u2019s basically holding my hand. It\u2019s fine, nothing to worry about. Totally cool over here. It\u2019s all good.</i></p><p>They finally broke free of the crowd and could stand next to each other again. Dan expected Phil to drop his wrist now that they had room to maneuver, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, Phil\u2019s hand slid down to lace their fingers together.</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart beat faster, and he stared down at their clasped hands. <i>Be cool, Dan, he\u2019s just holding your hand.</i></p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Phil asked tentatively.</p><p>Dan\u2019s head snapped up to make eye contact. Phil was blushing and looked like he was making a concerted effort not to hide his face.</p><p>\u201cHm? The hands? Yes, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s - it\u2019s great. Perfect, really.\u201d Dan fumbled, flustered.</p><p><i>I said be cool, that is </i>not<i> being cool</i>.</p><p>Phil\u2019s free hand rose up to cover his mouth slightly, trying to hide a giggle, but the crows feet around his eyes gave him away.</p><p>\u201cNooooo, don\u2019t laugh at me!\u201d Dan whined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil said through his laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re just too adorable.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks were definitely bright red by now. \u201cShut up,\u201d he grumbled. He stuck out his bottom lip in an exaggerated pout. </p><p>\u201cAwwww,\u201d Phil cooed. \u201cYou\u2019re really not making me think you\u2019re less adorable, if that was the goal.\u201d</p><p>Dan let out an exaggerated huff and walked slightly ahead of Phil - just far enough ahead to keep up his dramatic charade, but close enough that they could still hold hands.</p><p>They arrived at the Haunted Mansion line and worked their way to the front. Along the way, Dan and Phil took turns reading out all of the silly tombstones of the dead residents. Every so often, Phil would laugh at one of the funny ways of dying and say, \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d </p><p>On the ride itself, Dan cozied up to Phil as much as he dare. The seats were much bigger than Big Thunder Railroad and he - unfortunately - didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to squish into Phil\u2019s side in order to fit. He didn\u2019t want to drape himself all over Phil, but he wanted to be as close as was reasonably possible, so he settled for sitting close enough that their sides touched from shoulder to knee.</p><p><i>Is this too much? Is he uncomfortable? Oh, god, this was a mistake, wasn\u2019t it.</i></p><p>But then Phil\u2019s foot bumped Dan\u2019s, nudging it gently before hooking his ankle around Dan\u2019s.</p><p>Dan looked at Phil, happy to know that apparently Phil wanted to be close just as much as Dan, but Phil was steadfastly observing the other side of their cart. Dan rolled his eyes fondly and relaxed into the chair.</p><p>Their cart turned a corner, and the ride properly began. </p><p>Some of the spooks startled Phil throughout the ride, and Dan laughed at him for it.</p><p>\u201cReally, Phil? How didn\u2019t you expect that to pop up?\u201d Dan would tease, squeezing Phil\u2019s hand briefly.</p><p>\u201cShhhh, I just wasn\u2019t paying enough attention!\u201d Phil would reply, squeezing right back.</p><p>About halfway through the ride, the cart spun around and began descending a sharp hill backwards. Gravity squished Dan and Phil to the middle of the seat, right up against each other.</p><p>Dan breathed in sharply as their bodies pressed together even more than they already had been, and he quickly looked over at Phil\u2019s face. Phil was already looking at him, blushing heavily.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil whispered shyly. He flexed his fingers around Dan\u2019s before squeezing gently.</p><p>Equally shyly, Dan squeezed Phil\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>When the cart straightened out, neither of them made any effort to readjust to sit farther away from the other. Dan felt his heart soar when he realized that meant Phil wanted to be close to him, too.</p><p>Not long after, the ride came to an end. Phil let go of Dan\u2019s hand to climb out of the cart, then reached back to offer his hand as a support as Dan followed.</p><p>\u201cHow gentlemanly,\u201d Dan commented with a slight quirk of his lips. Inside, he was gushing about how sweet Phil was and how much he loved the feeling of the soft skin of Phil\u2019s hand against his own. He worried Phil would let go of his hand as soon as he got off the ride, but Phil only adjusted his grip to interlock their fingers again. He brushed his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles, and butterflies erupted in Dan\u2019s stomach.</p><p>As they left the Haunted Mansion set, they debated where to go next.</p><p>Phil\u2019s vote was the Winnie the Pooh ride.</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s such a cute one! Besides, you said you loved Pooh!\u201d Phil eagerly suggested.</p><p>Dan laughed and let Phil pull him across the park to the ride.</p><p><i>He wants to make me happy so much. I\u2019m supposed to be making sure we go on rides </i>he<i> likes but he\u2019s over here pushing me to do something for personal nostalgia\u2019s sake. He\u2019s so sweet.</i></p><p>Fortunately, the line wasn\u2019t too long, so they passed through the interactive buttons and animatronics until they made it to the carts. </p><p>They had to drop their hands to climb into the carts, much to Dan\u2019s annoyance, but he relaxed when Phil sat down probably closer than was strictly necessary.</p><p>Phil leaned in to whisper in Dan\u2019s ear, \u201cWill you hold my hand if I get scared?\u201d</p><p>Dan let out a loud laugh, turning his head to look at Phil.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Winnie the Pooh, so I doubt that\u2019ll be a problem.\u201d His hand found Phil\u2019s anyway as the ride began to move, already desperate for the comforting warmth and the accompanying rush of giddy excitement that Dan was beginning to associate with holding Phil\u2019s hand. Dan felt a grin breaking out on his face, playing it off as excitement for Winnie the Pooh. He looked around at the walls, quickly reading the giant storybook page that set up the story for the ride.</p><p>Just before they entered the ride, Dan looked back at Phil with a soft smile and quietly admitted, \u201cI like holding your hand, even if you aren\u2019t scared.\u201d</p><p>Phil bit his lip around a giddy smile, and Dan\u2019s heart just about melted at the sight.</p><p>\u201cOi, you\u2019ll miss the ride if you keep looking at me,\u201d Phil complained, nudging Dan\u2019s elbow with his own.</p><p>\u201cMmm, but I really like looking at you. Especially when I get you to blush like that,\u201d Dan teased, nudging Phil\u2019s shoulder playfully. He relented, though, deciding to enjoy the ride as Phil insisted.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a particularly thrilling ride, by any means. There were a few jerky turns and wobbles, but no dips or spins, and the pace was fairly slow. They both giggled as the ride bounced up and down, mimicking Tigger\u2019s bouncing.</p><p>Dan loved it anyway, partly because of the nostalgia of Winnie the Pooh and partly because of how into it Phil was. He never was <i>actually</i> scared, but he pretended to be when they came to the section of Heffalumps and Woozles, squeezing Dan\u2019s hand harder and bringing his other arm to hug Dan\u2019s. Phil\u2019s head came to rest on Dan\u2019s shoulder, and Dan went perfectly still.</p><p><i>Oh my god. He\u2019s so precious. Don\u2019t move, Dan, or he\u2019ll move</i>.</p><p>Luckily, it seemed that Phil had no intention of moving away from Dan for the rest of the ride. He stayed snuggled up to Dan\u2019s arm for the last few minutes of the story, then reluctantly detached himself as their cart came to the end. </p><p>\u201cThat was a great idea, Phil. I\u2019m glad you dragged me over here,\u201d Dan said happily as they exited the track area. He couldn\u2019t get the dopey smile off his face.</p><p>Phil gasped, ignoring Dan entirely in favor of pointing to the alcove next to the ride and tugging on their still-clasped hands. </p><p>\u201cLook! Tigger and Pooh are there for photos!\u201d He turned to Dan, expression extremely serious. \u201cWe have to go get pictures with them.\u201d</p><p>Dan was on the verge of saying no. They most likely knew whoever it was in the costumes, so some of the magic was already missing from the experience. Besides, it would <i>definitely</i> be weird if two awkwardly tall adult men got in line to meet <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>.</p><p>But Phil looked so excited and happy, Dan couldn\u2019t find it in himself to decline. Instead, he sighed in mock exasperation and gestured for Phil to lead the way.</p><p>Phil\u2019s face lit up even more, making Dan smile and shake his head fondly. </p><p><i>He\u2019s such a dork. I love that he\u2019s so willing to let himself be a kid at Disney. He really makes the magic come to life.</i></p><p>The line to meet Pooh and Tigger was significantly longer than the line for the ride had been, so they occupied their time by sharing anecdotes about their childhood experiences. Phil had several stories about the crazy things he did or believed as a kid, like how he thought the \u201cD\u201d in the Disney logo was actually a \u201cG\u201d or how crowds cheering at football matches scared him to the point of tears.</p><p>(Dan, of course, found this very endearing and jokingly promised he would never cheer at a football match in front of Phil.)</p><p>In exchange, Dan told Phil a few stories about some of his more embarrassing failures and awkward moments growing up, like how he got fired from his last job for selling an axe to a twelve-year-old. </p><p>Finally, they made it to the front of the line and got to meet Tigger and Pooh. They each got to hug both characters, much to Phil\u2019s delight. Before they took the picture, they also got to \u201ctalk\u201d with the animals. Neither character could actually say anything, but Tigger had some <i>very</i> articulate gestures.</p><p>He looked at Dan, then pointed back and forth between Dan and Phil, who was having an animated conversation with Pooh and completely unaware of the attention. Dan wasn\u2019t entirely sure, but he thought maybe Tigger had caught on to their affection. Sure enough, Tigger placed both hands over his heart and tilted his head.</p><p>Blushing, Dan laughed. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re here on a date,\u201d he confirmed in a low voice, trying not to attract Phil\u2019s attention away from where he talked with Pooh. It wasn\u2019t that the date was a secret, Dan just felt a little self-conscious that he was talking to one of his childhood idols - and probably coworkers, honestly - about a <i>date</i>.</p><p>Tigger gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up - or at least the closest thing he could get to a thumbs up in his costume. He took Dan\u2019s hand to guide him to Phil, made them hold hands, then moved to stand on the other side of Phil. Pooh stood next to Dan, and they were ready for pictures.</p><p>Dan and Phil both blushed profusely at Tigger\u2019s antics, even though they\u2019d already been holding hands all day. It was just a different experience when someone else noticed their feelings and nudged them together, showing Dan that maybe they <i>did</i> work well together. Plus, Dan realized that he was about to actually take a picture while <i>holding hands with Phil</i>, which would immortalize this perfect moment.</p><p>They took a few nice pictures with Pooh and Tigger, then bade them goodbye and left the meeting spot, still hand-in-hand.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing! Tigger saw right through us, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Phil chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHe definitely did,\u201d Dan agreed. He swung their clasped hands around slightly, enjoying the sensation of the contact. Casually, he added, \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s anybody we know today\u2026 We\u2019ll <i>definitely</i> be hearing about this at work later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh!\u201d Phil clapped a hand over Dan\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s <i>Tigger</i>, not somebody we know!\u201d he scolded, shaking his head in mock disappointment.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and smiled under Phil\u2019s hand. \u201cOf course, how could I ever forget,\u201d he deadpanned, though it came out warbled and muffled.</p><p>Phil narrowed his eyes at Dan suspiciously, then nodded once. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you said, but I\u2019ll take it as an apology. No more ruining the magic, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan sighed dramatically, then nodded. </p><p>Letting out a satisfied hum, Phil dropped his hand from Dan\u2019s mouth and looking around at their surroundings. His eyes landed on the gift shop for Winnie the Pooh, and he immediately started pulling Dan towards it. \u201cI just had the best idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like where you\u2019re going with this, love, the look on your face screams mischief,\u201d Dan said warily.</p><p><i>Did I just call him \u201clove\u201d? Oh shit, it is definitely too soon for pet names like that. Shit, that was too much.</i></p><p>But Phil didn\u2019t comment on it. If anything, his smile got wider as he mercilessly tugged Dan along. </p><p>\u201cShh, trust me! This will be amazing, I promise.\u201d Phil sounded particularly excited about this idea of his. </p><p>When they entered the shop, Phil made straight for the back wall. He let go of Dan\u2019s hand to pick up two Mickey Mouse ear hats, one Tigger and one Pooh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m buying these and we\u2019ll match for the rest of the day,\u201d Phil declared adamantly, sounding like he\u2019d already made up his mind.</p><p>Dan blinked in shock, glancing quickly from Phil to the hats and back again. \u201cUm, what? Phil, those are, like, $30 each. I can\u2019t let you get them for both of us on a date I asked you to, that would be ungentlemanly!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>Phil giggled. \u201cYou think I care about that? You\u2019ve already been such a gentleman so far. You bought lunch and everything! Besides, <i>I</i> want to get them. It was my idea, anyway, it\u2019s only right I pay for them. Plus, you\u2019re forgetting that we get a cast member discount, silly. Come on, please?\u201d Phil stuck out his bottom lip and opened his eyes wider in a puppy pout. </p><p>Dan hesitated, momentarily distracted by how endearing that expression was, before contemplating the issue at hand. He didn\u2019t want to push it too much and make it seem like he thought Phil couldn\u2019t afford the hats or something, but he also didn\u2019t want to make Phil pay for them. </p><p><i>Although, he\u2019s right - it was his idea. Surely he wouldn\u2019t have suggested it if he wasn\u2019t willing and expecting to pay for them\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d Dan relented. \u201cYou can buy us the hats, but I\u2019m buying dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already paid for lunch, though!\u201d Phil exclaimed with a tone. \u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to treat you,\u201d Dan mumbled sheepishly, tugging gently on Phil\u2019s hand. He looked up at Phil through his lashes as he continued, \u201cI want you to feel special today, you know? This should all be about you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s free hand reached up and brushed some of Phil\u2019s drooping quiff off his forehead, eventually resting his hand on Phil\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Phil nuzzled into Dan\u2019s hand slightly, looking a little conflicted for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, alright then, if you insist. You can pay for dinner later. But right now, I\u2019m going to get these hats and make everyone jealous of our relationship,\u201d Phil announced with a flare.</p><p><i>Relationship? Does that mean he wants to be boyfriends? Is it too early for that? I mean\u2026 I think I want that, but does he? I know we\u2019re still only on the first date, but this feels so </i>natural<i> that it would just make sense to make it official, wouldn\u2019t it? </i></p><p>Dan decided to tuck the questions away for now, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat as he followed closely behind Phil to the registers.</p><p>Phil quickly paid and picked up the hats from the counter, turning to face Dan.</p><p>\u201cAlright, then, let\u2019s see it on you. May I?\u201d Phil asked, gesturing towards Dan\u2019s head with the Pooh hat and smiling.</p><p><i>My hair is going to hate this\u2026</i></p><p>Dan leaned forward in answer, presenting his head for Phil. Phil slowly fixed the hat over Dan\u2019s head, placing the chin strap under his chin to secure it in place. He reached up and messed with his hair, carefully pulling out a few strands from under the hat. Usually, Dan wouldn\u2019t let anyone fix his hair for him because he alone knew how to make it look good, but he didn\u2019t complain as Phil fluffed the exposed ends. Somehow, he felt like he could trust Phil to do it right. After a lingering moment, Phil pulled his hands away, and Dan tilted his head back up so Phil could inspect the results.</p><p>He inhaled sharply and stared at Dan with an unreadable expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Does it look weird?\u201d Dan asked, suddenly nervous. He took out his phone to use the camera as a mirror. </p><p>It actually wasn\u2019t too bad; his hair was definitely more of a mess now, but he actually looked fairly good with the hat.</p><p>Dan looked back up to see Phil still staring at him, now with a beaming smile.</p><p>Dan blushed at the attention, and Phil cooed.</p><p>\u201cI knew this would be a good idea. You look fantastic,\u201d Phil assured Dan, reaching up a hand again and gently brushing his fingers through the visible floof of hair poking out from under the hat. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan mumbled, feeling the blush continue to burn on his cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiled brightly at him, then dropped his hand from Dan\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Phil thrust the Tigger hat towards Dan\u2019s hand, then tilted his head down so Dan could put the hat on him.</p><p>Dan stretched the elastic over Phil\u2019s chin and pushed the hat back onto Phil\u2019s head. He brushed his fingers through Phil\u2019s quiff to make sure his hair wouldn\u2019t look weird, marvelling at the softness for a moment, then removed his hands.</p><p>Phil\u2019s head tilted back up, and he was grinning, and his face was <i>so close</i> to Dan\u2019s that, for a moment, Dan\u2019s brain short-circuited.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil giggled.</p><p>The giggle was enough to pull Dan\u2019s brain back together in a flurry of thoughts.</p><p><i>Great, my cheeks are going to be permanently pink around Phil, apparently</i>.<i> It doesn\u2019t help that he looks unfairly pretty in that Tigger hat with his stupid gorgeous quiff poking out just a little and he looks so excited and happy and wait what did he say again? Was I supposed to respond? Oh yeah -</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Dan awkwardly said a few beats too late.</p><p>Phil giggled again, not seeming to care about Dan\u2019s awkwardness, then reached into his pocket for his phone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a selfie, immortalize the moment,\u201d Phil suggested.</p><p><i>Oh my god, yes. We are too cute, and I need a picture of Phil looking like this so I can look back on this moment and absolutely melt. He looks so happy.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it, if you want. I\u2019ve mastered the perfect selfie angle with my noodle arms,\u201d Dan joked, stepping closer to Phil.</p><p>Dan expected Phil to just stand next to him, but apparently Phil was in the mood to murder Dan because he stood closer than he really had to for the picture and then reached out an arm to wrap it around Dan\u2019s waist.</p><p>Dan\u2019s selfie arm faltered briefly at the sensation of Phil\u2019s warm arm on his body. He barely bit back a surprised squeak, since he knew that would make Phil think he was uncomfortable and he\u2019d move his arm. That was the last thing Dan wanted. Phil\u2019s half-embrace felt so strong and comforting and <i>safe</i>, Dan wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to survive when Phil eventually moved.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Dan asked, voice a little shaky.</p><p>\u201cYee!\u201d Phil replied.</p><p>Dan snapped a few photos, changing the angle slightly to try to capture the perfect shot. Normally, for a picture like this, he would give a half-smile, or maybe a smirk, but right now? There was no way he could keep the ridiculous grin from his face.</p><p>And then Phil turned his head and kissed Dan right on the cheek as Dan snapped a picture. Dan\u2019s eyes widened and his mouth dropped open in shock.</p><p><i>Did he just - he\u2019s still - oh my god. Oh my </i>GOD. <i>Okay, okay, okay, shhhhh, calm down before he gets weird about it, come on, get it together, Dan.</i></p><p>A flaming red blush spread across Dan\u2019s cheeks and his mouth spread in a face-splitting grin for the last few pictures Dan took. Butterflies zoomed around his stomach like they were trying to escape, and a few seemed to find their way out as giggles. A few of the giggles erupted from Dan\u2019s throat, and he covered his mouth with his hand to prevent any more from escaping</p><p>Dan wasn\u2019t sure what to say as Phil pulled away from his cheek. He wasn\u2019t even sure where to <i>look</i>. He could still feel Phil\u2019s strong arm around his waist, and it made thinking difficult. His thoughts swirled wildly as he tried to figure out what to do. Should he look at Phil and let him see how Dan was still reeling? Should he run away? Should he act like nothing happened and look at the pictures? And would he ever stop grinning like a madman?</p><p>He opted for sending Phil a shy, happy glance, then pretending like nothing had happened (which was a little hard to do around his grin, but he tried to ignore that detail). He cleared his throat and looked at his phone, opening the photos app and scrolling through the selfies he took.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably at least one good one in here,\u201d Dan said to distract himself. He looked through the pictures, quickly skimming past the ones where Phil was kissing him to find the first photos.</p><p>\u201cWait - Phil! You\u2019re not even looking at the phone in any of these!\u201d Dan exclaimed, looking over at his date in mock irritation.</p><p>Phil was already looking at him with a fond smile. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not looking at the phone. How could I, when you\u2019re here in front of me?\u201d he asked softly. His face was open and honest, and the fond smile twitched until it grew into a full grin.</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks darkened again. He opened his mouth to respond, but all that came out was a sort of strangled, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Phil giggled, his tongue poking through his teeth.</p><p><i>How does he keep getting more and more adorable, oh my god</i>. <i>This man will be the death of me.</i></p><p>Phil\u2019s arm dropped from around Dan\u2019s waist, much to Dan\u2019s disappointment.</p><p>\u201cCome on! We\u2019ve got more rides to go on!\u201d Phil reminded him gleefully. </p><p>He quickly re-discovered Dan\u2019s hand (making butterflies zoom around in his stomach again) and began pulling him out of the shop again, already going on about how he wanted to go on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad again.</p><p>Dan shook his head fondly, but followed Phil anyway.</p><p>A few hours later, they had ridden all Phil\u2019s favorites another time as well as the Winnie the Pooh ride, this time with their Pooh and Tigger ear hats, and they realized they were both starving.</p><p>They meandered over to Pinocchio\u2019s Village Haus for a quick dinner (Phil got chicken nuggets, which Dan found endearing as hell), and then headed back out for a few more roller coasters before they had to find a spot for the fireworks.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I know you love the roller coasters, but we really have to go pick our place to watch the fireworks!\u201d Dan laughed, tugging Phil\u2019s arm to get him to stay out of the line for the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> ride. \u201cBesides, we\u2019ve already been on this one three times. Haven\u2019t you had enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can never have too many pirates, Pooh!\u201d Phil exclaimed excitedly. He tugged right back on Dan\u2019s arm in a desperate attempt to return to the <i>Pirates</i> ride.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes in exasperation. \u201cBut the whole point of coming here was to show you the fireworks!\u201d He stuck out his bottom lip in a pout and batted his eyes at Phil. \u201cPwease, Phiw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwww, now that\u2019s just cheating,\u201d Phil whined. He pouted in return, but Dan wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>Dan jutted his bottom lip out even further, and Phil cracked.</p><p>\u201cOh, alright then,\u201d Phil sighed. \u201cLead the way.\u201d </p><p>A smug grin made its way onto Dan\u2019s lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Follow me, my liege,\u201d Dan said with a mock bow. He took a great deal of joy in the soft giggle he heard Phil make.</p><p>When Phil had agreed to the date, Dan had immediately made sure to reserve them a spot in front of Cinderella\u2019s Castle, where the view would be best. They headed to that area now, waiting for an attendant to allow them into the reserved section directly in front of the castle.</p><p>Even though it was still light out, there was a long line of people waiting to get into the reserved area, so Dan and Phil took their place at the back and hunkered down to wait.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do the fireworks come from, again? Like, which way should I be looking?\u201d Phil asked, inspecting the area around them as if he expected a firework to go off any moment.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole song and show and everything that\u2019ll be around the Castle,\u201d Dan told him. </p><p>Phil nodded absentmindedly, still looking around the park. </p><p>Dan took the quiet moment to appreciate the memories of the day. He thought about how excited Phil had been that morning, and how happy Phil had been when he learned that Dan loved Winnie the Pooh, and how insistent Phil was about the Winnie the Pooh-themed hats they were both still wearing. Dan thought about how <i>good</i> and <i>right</i> the whole day had felt, with the never-ending conversation and playful flirting and hand-holding. <i>God</i>, the <i>handholding</i>. He couldn\u2019t get enough of the feeling of his hand gently clutched by Phil\u2019s. Sometimes, Phil would run his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles, sending all coherent thought flying desperately from his brain and attracting all the blood to his cheeks, making it painfully obvious how much he <i>adored</i> Phil\u2019s actions. </p><p>As they waited for the fireworks, Dan tentatively moved his own thumb over Phil\u2019s hand, wondering if Phil would have a similar reaction to Dan. The blinding smile Phil sent Dan told him that yes, Phil liked that just as much as Dan.</p><p>Phil took a small step in so their sides were entirely pressed up against each other, then leaned in to be even closer.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil whispered with a light smile. \u201cToday\u2019s been great.\u201d</p><p>Dan beamed. The whole goal of the day had been to make Phil as happy as possible. He was proud to say that he firmly believed he had accomplished that goal, and they hadn\u2019t even seen the fireworks yet.</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen the fireworks yet. That was supposed to be the great part of the day,\u201d Dan reminded him.</p><p>Phil laughed gently, reaching up his free hand to carefully cup Dan\u2019s cheek. Dan\u2019s heartbeat quickened as he subconsciously leaned into the touch.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dan,\u201d Phil sighed happily. \u201cThe great part was spending time with you, no matter what we did.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s thumb caressed Dan\u2019s cheek, and Dan\u2019s brain shorted out.</p><p><i>He- I- Great? My face? His hand? My god.</i></p><p>Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, all Dan could think to say was a breathy, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s responding laugh brushed delicately against Dan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSpeechless, Howell? That\u2019s surprising,\u201d he teased. \u201cI like seeing you all flustered. I\u2019ll have to keep making it happen.\u201d He winked at Dan in his special Phil way, where it\u2019s more of a blink than a wink, then let go of Dan entirely and turned towards the line, which had finally moved forward to allow people into the reserved section.</p><p>Dan blinked in surprise. </p><p><i>What just happened? I didn\u2019t even notice the line move. What is this boy </i>doing<i> to me?</i></p><p>He shook himself slightly, quickly catching up to Phil and re-clasping their hands.</p><p><i>Should I address what just happened? What would I even say? I\u2019m not sure I know what happened, anyway. </i></p><p>Dan chanced a glance at Phil and saw a smirk playing at his lips.</p><p><i>That\u2019s a dangerous smirk. He looks mischievous - he\u2019s way too pleased with himself. It\u2019s probably best if I just move on, before I make more of a fool of myself.</i></p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d he began, louder than he expected. He winced internally, begging himself to be less awkward. Clearing his throat, he tried again, lowering his voice to a normal volume this time. \u201cSo, are you ready to see the most beautiful, captivating thing you will ever see?\u201d</p><p>A full smirk formed on Phil\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen him. He\u2019s actually somehow letting me hold his hand,\u201d he said teasingly, swinging their hands pointedly.</p><p>Dan groaned, looking towards the heavens as if asking for God to come save him from this dork, but he couldn\u2019t disguise his smile, nor his accompanying blush. \u201cOh, <i>that</i> was cheesy as hell. I walked right into it, too, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He looked back at Phil with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly did.\u201d Phil grinned, bumping Dan\u2019s shoulder with his own. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re all blushy again, how adorable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace. A danger to society. Too pure for this world,\u201d Dan deadpanned.</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cOne of these things is not like the other.\u201d</p><p>In a sing-song voice, Dan replied, \u201cBut all of them describe you perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Phil bumped Dan\u2019s shoulder again, harder this time. \u201cYour mum\u2019s a description.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Dan shrieked out in a hyena laugh. \u201cThat- that doesn\u2019t even make sense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mum doesn\u2019t even-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare finish that sentence,\u201d Dan warned teasingly. \u201cLeave my poor mum alone.\u201d To make sure Phil didn\u2019t take him too seriously, Dan squeezed his hand lightly. If his heart raced a little faster when Phil squeezed back, well, no one had to know.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going to watch the fireworks from?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan hummed in thought, looking around the open area for a good spot. \u201cHow about right there?\u201d He pointed to a place near the front of the section, but far enough back that they wouldn\u2019t block everyone\u2019s line of sight with their tallness.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Phil agreed with a content nod. </p><p>Phil followed Dan to their spot. Once they got there, Dan hugged Phil\u2019s arm with his own free arm and rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Dan looked up at Phil from his shoulder. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d Dan asked. He felt Phil nod. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d came Phil\u2019s fond reply. Phil squeezed Dan\u2019s hand once, then brushed his thumb over Dan\u2019s knuckles again. </p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been leaning on Phil already, Dan was sure he would\u2019ve fallen over completely in a swoon. Phil somehow knew exactly what to do to make Dan unbelievably happy, and Dan was living for it.</p><p>For a few minutes, they stood in silence, just enjoying each other\u2019s presence and the feeling of their bodies pressed together as they waited for the fireworks. </p><p>The lights around the crowd went out, and Cinderella\u2019s Castle lit up.</p><p>\u201cIs it starting?\u201d Phil asked.</p><p>Dan resisted the urge to sass Phil, because <i>honestly, what else could be happening? Disney shut down the park with everyone still in it?</i></p><p>Instead, he hummed quietly in affirmation and snuggled closer into Phil\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Music began, and the crowd was entranced. Oohs and Ahhs rang out in the plaza with every new animation and special effect. The lights and the music, combined with the magical experience that is spending a day at Disney World, always delivered a spectacular performance.</p><p>But Dan wasn\u2019t really paying attention. </p><p>Dan was looking at Phil. Well, some would call it <i>staring</i>, but Dan couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. </p><p>Phil\u2019s expression was so relaxed, so <i>happy</i>. Every new piece to the show had him gasping in delight, a childlike wonder in his eyes. Dan couldn\u2019t get enough of it.</p><p>And then Phil seemed to notice that Dan wasn\u2019t watching the fireworks. He turned his head slightly, looking at Dan, who was still carefully resting on his shoulder despite the Pooh ears.</p><p>Normally, Dan would\u2019ve been embarrassed to be caught staring, but all he could feel was an overwhelming affection for the man who had spent the whole day trying to make sure Dan had a good time, even though Dan was meant to be treating Phil. </p><p>A fond smile grew on Phil\u2019s face as he and Dan got lost in each other\u2019s gaze. </p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Phil whispered just loud enough to be heard over the fireworks and music. His free hand moved up and carded through Dan\u2019s exposed fringe slowly, then came to rest on his cheek. His thumb delicately traced Dan\u2019s cheekbone. </p><p>If he could, Dan would have purred at the gentle motion of Phil\u2019s thumb. Instead, he sighed through his nose and leaned into the touch with a smile. He trailed his fingers along Phil\u2019s forearm, appreciating how Phil shivered at the sensation. \u201cHi.\u201d </p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes quickly flickered over Dan\u2019s face, and his smile grew. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty,\u201d he stated simply, as if it were just a fact that the whole world should know.</p><p>Dan turned to hide his face in Phil\u2019s shoulder in embarrassment. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just say things like that,\u201d he whined. \u201cThey do weird things to me and make me feel all soft.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand moved from caressing Dan\u2019s face to rest comfortingly on Dan\u2019s waist. \u201cBut it\u2019s true! And I love seeing you blush when I tell you so.\u201d Phil wiggled his elbow. \u201cCome on, let me see your pretty face.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling false complaints, Dan slowly lifted his head to look Phil in the eye.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d Phil whispered adoringly. He shifted his hand up from Dan\u2019s waist to gently cup his face, stroking his cheekbone with his thumb.</p><p>Dan felt his blush intensify and looked away for a moment to try to regain his composure. When he finally felt ready to look at Phil again, he found that Phil\u2019s gaze moving slowly over his face, taking in every detail.</p><p>It was a whole new feeling. Dan had realized throughout the day that, yes, Phil did actually kind of like him, but the way Phil looked at him now was so much <i>more</i> - more even than just moments before. This was an intense gaze, which intimidated Dan a little, but mostly he was just overwhelmed with happiness at the brilliant realization that Phil <i>liked him</i>. Dan felt wanted in a way that stretched beyond just the physical, and he was overcome with emotion.</p><p>His eyes could no longer stay still on Phil\u2019s. They trailed over his features, just as Phil\u2019s were doing to him, and took in the sharp cheekbones, the beaked nose, the freckles and spots, the way his pink lips contrasted his pale skin. And then all he could look at were Phil\u2019s lips. Their soft curve into Phil\u2019s small half-smile, the way they pouted out slightly. They looked soft. Kissable.</p><p><i>Are they as soft as they look? Would he kiss me if I asked?</i></p><p>Dan somehow managed to pull his eyes up from Phil\u2019s mouth to see his eyes instead. He wanted to know what Phil was thinking and know if he had any chance.</p><p>Phil was still looking at Dan\u2019s face, but it seemed his sights were stuck on Dan\u2019s mouth. Dan felt a shiver course through him when he thought of what Phil might be thinking. His shiver seemed to jolt Phil out of his thoughts, as his eyes snapped up to meet Dan\u2019s.</p><p>They stood still. Dan\u2019s thoughts were caught in a constant loop of <i>kiss me, kiss me, kiss me</i> as he tried to work up the courage to ask, but he wasn\u2019t sure he could bring himself to say the words. </p><p><i>Come on, just ask! You want to, and he seems like he wants to, and you just have to go for it. Just say it. He won\u2019t say no. But what if he does? What if I\u2019ve been reading the whole situation wrong?</i></p><p>As Dan\u2019s internal crisis continued, Phil took a small step forward, eliminating the last traces of space between their bodies. Phil\u2019s lips remained ever so slightly apart, like he wasn\u2019t sure he had Dan\u2019s permission.</p><p>Emboldened by Phil\u2019s move, Dan made a decision. Slowly, his eyelids fluttered closed, and he leaned in the smallest bit so their lips brushed.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand on Dan\u2019s cheek slid back into his hair, just below the edge of the Pooh hat, and brushed his fingers through the curls. Dan sighed into the kiss, and Phil\u2019s lips moved softly against Dan\u2019s. </p><p>It was a little tentative, and their noses bumped together awkwardly at first, but it felt right. They kept it slow and purposeful, just exploring the feeling of each other. Dan wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever had such a perfect first kiss, and he drowned in the sensation.</p><p>They pulled apart not too long after the kiss began. Bashful smiles grew on their faces as their eyes opened, and Dan bit his lip in an attempt to keep from grinning too much. Phil\u2019s tongue poked between his teeth a little, and Dan\u2019s heart melted. </p><p>Phil\u2019s fingers disentangled from Dan\u2019s, and Dan panicked.</p><p><i>He doesn\u2019t want to hold my hand anymore? What did I do wrong? Did he hate the kiss? But then why did he smile? What no-</i></p><p>Dan\u2019s thoughts were cut off by the feeling of Phil\u2019s now-free arm wrapping around Dan\u2019s shoulder and pulling him in to cuddle into Phil\u2019s side. Phil\u2019s other hand found Dan\u2019s again, and he clasped them in front of their bodies. </p><p><i>Oh.</i> Dan giggled. <i>That\u2019s better, then.</i></p><p>He rested his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder, careful to tip his head far enough backwards that he wouldn\u2019t dig his Pooh ears into Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p><i>This is the best first date </i>ever<i>.</i></p><p>They had missed most of the fireworks just staring at each other and kissing, but they caught the grand finale. Phil periodically made small noises of wonder and amazement that Dan wished he could bottle up and keep forever.</p><p>Too soon, the fireworks ended. Phil turned to Dan with a tired, but happy, smile, which Dan returned.</p><p>They made their way back through the crowd and to the parking lot, still hand-in-hand. It was a bit of a long walk, given the number of people trying to leave and the crazy distance from the park to the parking lot, but they were content to walk it in silence. The silence was comfortable, like a warm hug or a soft kiss. Dan wished the moment never had to end.</p><p>They eventually made it to Dan\u2019s car. Dan held the door open for Phil and shut it behind him, then went to open his own door and sit down behind the wheel.</p><p>Phil let out a deep, happy sigh. \u201cThat was really fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I had a really good time,\u201d Dan sighed happily as he started the car. He didn\u2019t move the car yet, though. Instead, he sat back in his seat and looked over at Phil with a small smile.</p><p>Phil\u2019s hand crept forward and caught Dan\u2019s over the middle console, squeezing gently. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you missed some of the fireworks, though. That was kind of the whole reason we came,\u201d Dan said plainly, like he felt like it had to be said. He wasn\u2019t sorry at all, actually, as what made Phil miss the fireworks was infinitely better than the fireworks themselves. He was also fairly certain Phil wasn\u2019t too bothered by it, but he felt like it had to be said, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not. But, hey, that gives us something to do next time,\u201d Phil said casually, looking over at Dan, the ghost of a smile playing at his lips.</p><p>It took Dan\u2019s brain a moment to process Phil\u2019s words</p><p>\u201cNext time?\u201d he asked hopefully, a wide grin spreading across his face. <i>Please, this was amazing</i>.</p><p>\u201cYep. Maybe we\u2019ll go to Epcot to see those fireworks, instead.\u201d Phil smirked. \u201cOr maybe we\u2019ll miss those, too.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart skipped a bit and red flooded his cheeks.</p><p><i>Fuck. He wants to kiss me more? He wants to do this again. Oh my god.</i></p><p>Laughter outside the car jolted Dan out of his thoughts. A family walked past, and Dan watched them find their car. </p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better start driving home.\u201d </p><p>He put the car in gear and moved them towards the line of cars trying to leave the park. Phil started talking about his favorite funny moments of the day, and Dan chimed in with a few Phil missed. Phil also insisted that Dan tell him he was right about the Pooh hats. </p><p>\u201cThey were the most important thing. They completed the whole picture. You\u2019re the one always going on and on about aesthetics! There\u2019s no way you think they weren\u2019t the best idea ever,\u201d Phil argued playfully. He had a smug grin on his face and he poked Dan\u2019s arm a few times to drive his point home.</p><p><i>God, he\u2019s cute. He </i>so<i> wants me to agree with him, but I can\u2019t give up that easily</i>, Dan thought mischievously. A smirk formed on his face as he started to rile Phil up about it.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he drawled. \u201cWinnie the Pooh doesn\u2019t fit my aesthetic, especially not right now. Yellow ears with this pink and blue shirt? Major clashing goin\u2019 on here. I definitely look ridiculous.\u201d Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Phil\u2019s jaw drop in mock outrage. Dan\u2019s smirk grew as his plan succeeded.</p><p>\u201cWinnie the Pooh fits <i>everyone\u2019s</i> aesthetic! There\u2019s never a wrong time to wear Pooh ears, and looking ridiculous is the best part of it! Plus, we looked so cute together that it had to have been worth it,\u201d Phil declared indignantly.</p><p>\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201d Dan hummed thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose we were a little cute, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Phil squawked. \u201cA <i>little</i>? Only a <i>little</i>? I\u2019ll have you know we were <i>definitely</i> the cutest people anyone saw at the Magic Kingdom <i>all day</i>,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEveryone was jealous of us.\u201d He crossed his arms with a huff, shooting Dan a sour glare. \u201cIt was the <i>best</i> idea.\u201d</p><p>Dan finally couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter anymore, letting it out in a loud burst absolutely <i>drenched</i> in fondness. He reached a hand out and pried Phil\u2019s arms apart so he could hold Phil\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you, Phil! I loved the hats and the cute couple aesthetic and how jealous we made everyone else. They <i>were</i> the best idea.\u201d He chanced a glance over at Phil, who had finally relaxed back into his seat after tensely arguing his points. Dan sent him an affectionate smile. \u201cThank you. They made my day. Well,\u201d he added after a beat, \u201cmaybe not <i>quite</i>. The fireworks would be hard to beat.\u201d</p><p>Phil blushed heavily, biting his lip to hide a grin. \u201cGood. Great. The hats and the\u2026 <i>fireworks</i>.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled their clasped hands to his face and pressed a delicate kiss to the back of Phil\u2019s hand, delighting in the quiet giggle it tugged from Phil, then let go of Phil\u2019s hand to put his hand back on the steering wheel.</p><p>After a few minutes of companionable silence, they moved on to talking about their jobs and why they worked at Disney, describing the incomparable feeling of bringing the magical joy to everyone who visited. Somehow, these conversations led them all the way back to Phil\u2019s house. Dan wasn\u2019t sure where the time went, but he wished it would come back.</p><p>He pulled over in front of Phil\u2019s house and put the car in park, resting his hand on the middle console.</p><p><i>I really don\u2019t want this to end.</i></p><p>Apparently Phil didn\u2019t want it to end either, as he made no move to get up. He just sat, staring at his house for a moment, then he turned to Dan.</p><p>\u201cI really did have a great time,\u201d he said quietly, reaching out to play with Dan\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Dan smiled softly, meeting Phil\u2019s gaze. \u201cMe too,\u201d he whispered fondly. He moved his hand slightly so it was holding Phil\u2019s, and he squeezed gently.</p><p>\u201cThanks for treating me. It was sweet of you.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s cheeks flushed, and he looked down. \u201cYou deserve to feel special,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Soft fingers brushed against Dan\u2019s jaw, carefully raising his face so he would look at Phil.</p><p><i>Phil\u2019s so beautiful. How did I even get here? </i></p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Phil whispered. \u201cSo, if it\u2019s okay with you, <i>I\u2019ll</i> take <i>you</i> out next time.\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded slowly. He was completely speechless with happiness. Phil had just confirmed that this would happen again, and Dan was thrilled and just a bit overwhelmed, especially with how Phil\u2019s hand caressed his cheek and how close Phil\u2019s face was to his. </p><p>And then Phil\u2019s face came even closer, and Dan\u2019s eyes closed as their lips touched.</p><p>It was a soft and sweet kiss, shorter than the ones earlier that night, and it left Dan wanting more as Phil pulled away.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Phil whispered, his breath fanning across Dan\u2019s face. </p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Dan replied softly, his eyes locked on Phil\u2019s. He wished the night didn\u2019t have to end, that he could spend more time with Phil, but he didn\u2019t push it. Maybe a different night, but not right now. The rest of their day had already been perfect, anyway.</p><p>Phil smiled, then turned and got out of the car, quickly walking up the walkway to his house.</p><p>Dan stared after him in a daze, reaching up and touching his lips with his fingers. He let out a lovestruck sigh, then smiled wide as he started to drive back home.</p><p>A memory came to him as he drove, and he smiled, then laughed.</p><p>He definitely didn\u2019t need to worry about some six-year-old coming and stealing his Phil away.</p>",

How his heart hadn&rsquo;t yet fallen out of his ass from the sheer power of emotion, Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure. Phil was literally Dan&rsquo;s ideal man. And Phil had agreed to go on a date with him. As excited as Dan was, he was equally filled with anxiety at everything that could go wrong.</p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t fuck it up, Dan</i>.</p><p>On the drive over to Phil&rsquo;s house, Dan worried that he had somehow gotten the wrong address, or that his phone&rsquo;s GPS had sent him the wrong way, or that he&rsquo;d be late to pick Phil up, or that Phil would have already left his house and moved back to England.</p><p>It was ridiculous, honestly, but Dan couldn&rsquo;t help it. He <i>really</i> wanted this date to work out.</p><p>Every red light added to his stress. He kept glancing at the little clock in his car, watching the minutes pass. He was supposed to pick Phil up at 7am sharp, but the time ticked closer and closer, and Dan felt like he wasn&rsquo;t getting anywhere closer to Phil&rsquo;s house anytime soon. His nerves grew with every second that passed, and he found himself chewing on his lip in anticipation. He had done his best to leave his house with time to spare, but now that he was actually en route, he wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d made it out the door in time. </p><p><i>He&rsquo;ll be so disappointed if I&rsquo;m late. Dan the Fuck-Up, as usual, can&rsquo;t even be bothered to make it to a date on time. Classic- </i></p><p>&ldquo;Arrived,&rdquo; said the mechanical voice on Dan&rsquo;s phone, interrupting Dan&rsquo;s spiral of thoughts. </p><p>Dan pulled over in front of a small house. It looked like it might have been white, but Dan couldn&rsquo;t be sure in the faint early morning light.</p><p>He anxiously checked the clock again. It was 7:06.</p><p><i>Bloody typical.</i></p><p>Phil had told Dan to text when he arrived, saying it would be easier than knocking on the door and waking up Phil&rsquo;s housemates and suffering their persistent teasing. Dan didn&rsquo;t waste any time grabbing his phone from the passenger&rsquo;s seat and texting Phil. He didn&rsquo;t want Phil to have to wait any longer than he already had.</p><p><b>Dan:</b> im here</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s response came within seconds, startling Dan.</p><p><i>He responded so fast, he must have been waiting. Dammit, Dan, why are you always late?! He&rsquo;s probably mad about it.</i></p><p>He took a deep breath and opened the message.</p><p><b>Phil:<i> </i></b>gr8 gimme 2 secs i&rsquo;ll b right there</p><p>Dan let out the breath he had been holding. Phil wasn&rsquo;t mad. At least, Dan assumed so, since Phil said he was coming. </p><p>Nervously, Dan&rsquo;s hands began dancing and tapping randomly on the steering wheel of his car.  </p><p><i>He&rsquo;s coming. Oh my god, the date is about to start. Oh my god. </i></p><p>He looked outside the window, anxiously watching the door of the house- but then he looked away to look at the road because watching the door meant actively waiting for Phil to exit his house, which was stressful in itself because it made him think about how much time was passing and how much time Phil had to change his mind and decide not to come on the date after all.</p><p><i>This date has to be </i>perfect<i>. If it&rsquo;s not perfect, he won&rsquo;t want to go on another date and you&rsquo;ll end up alone and sad. </i></p><p>Dan noticed his leg was bouncing erratically from the nerves and forced himself to take a breath.</p><p><i>It&rsquo;ll be okay. He wanted to go with you this time, so he clearly must like </i>something<i> about you. Just chill out.</i></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the house opened and Phil stepped out, turning and locking it behind him.</p><p>The nerves struck Dan again as Phil approached, manifesting in even more intense finger tapping. Phil&rsquo;s hair was quiffed up off his forehead, and Dan ached to run his fingers through it. He wore a red plaid shirt, well-fitted to his broad shoulders and making his biceps pop. His black skinny jeans had rips in the knees, giving him a bit of an edgy aesthetic that Dan knew didn&rsquo;t reflect Phil&rsquo;s true nerdy, kind personality. Dan was intimidated as hell by Phil&rsquo;s appearance. How could he look so put-together this early in the morning?? It literally was not fair, and Dan felt inadequate in his own ripped black skinny jeans and cherry blossom button-up. His leg started to vibrate again, and he rolled his eyes at himself.</p><p><i>Get it together, Dan</i>.</p><p>They made eye contact through the windscreen, and Phil flashed Dan one of his absolutely <i>adorable</i> smiles. Dan&rsquo;s heartbeat picked up even more at the sight, and he managed a small smile in return.</p><p><i>He&rsquo;s so perfect.</i></p><p>Phil arrived at the passenger door and pulled the handle. The door didn&rsquo;t open. Phil shot Dan a confused look through the window. His brows were furrowed, and there was a cute little wrinkle in the middle of his forehead. Phil pulled the handle again, then pouted up at Dan. His bottom lip was sticking out, and his eyebrows were lifting.</p><p><i>What? Why isn&rsquo;t it ope-</i> <i>Oh.</i></p><p>Dan sheepishly flipped the &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; switch on the control panel next to his arm, then motioned for Phil to try again. This time, it worked, and Phil slid into the seat with a cheeky smile. </p><p>&ldquo;And here I thought you were excited for this date,&rdquo; Phil teased lightheartedly.</p><p><i>Shit! Now he thinks I don&rsquo;t want this!</i></p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed loudly, eyes wide and hands reaching out as if to grab Phil&rsquo;s arm and keep him in the car.</p><p>Phil blinked, tilting his head to the side and furrowing his brow. Clearly, Dan had confused him again. </p><p>Dan winced at his own unending awkwardness, then backpedaled to try to salvage the conversation that had <i>barely even begun, god, get it together, Dan</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;I am <i>really</i> excited for this date, Phil, you have no idea,&rdquo; he began, refusing to look at Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just also really nervous-&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s giggle interrupted the beginnings of a rant that surely would make Dan feel much worse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kidding! I know you&rsquo;re excited,&rdquo; Phil laughed. </p><p>The fondness in Phil&rsquo;s voice caused Dan to cautiously look at Phil out of the corner of his eye. </p><p>Sure enough, the fondest of smiles graced Phil&rsquo;s lips. Dan could feel himself blushing, and he hoped Phil wouldn&rsquo;t notice (but he was sure the color on his cheeks was glaringly obvious). </p><p>Slowly, Phil reached a tentative hand out to one of Dan&rsquo;s, gently prying his white-knuckled grasp off the steering wheel to intertwine their fingers. Dan stared at their linked hands in wonder. Phil&rsquo;s hand was a little smaller and a lot paler, but it looked perfect in Dan&rsquo;s. Dan felt a clammy warmth coming from Phil&rsquo;s palm, and he relaxed a little when he realized that must mean that Phil wasn&rsquo;t feeling as confident as he seemed- at least Dan wasn&rsquo;t alone in his nerves. </p><p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s okay that you&rsquo;re nervous. I&rsquo;m nervous, too.&rdquo; Phil leaned in closer to Dan to whisper conspiratorially, &ldquo;Plus, you&rsquo;re really cute when you blush.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan figured that Phil would probably think Dan was &ldquo;really cute&rdquo; most of the date, then, because he couldn&rsquo;t seem to get his cheeks to calm down. If anything, he was pretty sure his cheeks were getting even more red.</p><p>Flustered, Dan didn&rsquo;t know what to say in response, so he just looked back at the road, shaking his head in slight disbelief.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t know how he could think I&rsquo;m cute when he&rsquo;s obviously the cutest person in the universe</i>.</p><p>Dan swallowed nervously. &ldquo;We should- uh- get going. The whole point of getting up before daylight was to get there early, right?&rdquo; Dan said, deciding to ignore Phil&rsquo;s comment entirely. </p><p>Phil shrugged and leaned back in his seat, releasing Dan&rsquo;s hand so he could drive.</p><p>He carefully checked that the road was clear before pulling into the lane.</p><p>Although his eyes were trained on the street, Dan could practically <i>feel</i> Phil&rsquo;s self-satisfied grin. He couldn&rsquo;t help the blush that just wouldn&rsquo;t go away, not when he knew Phil was smiling because of him. </p><p><i>That cute bitch. God, I&rsquo;m a mess.</i></p><p>Phil must have sensed Dan&rsquo;s current inability to converse like a proper human being, and decided to take pity on him because he took charge of the conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved Disney.&rdquo; Phil said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I was definitely that kid who sat inside all day rewatching <i>The Lion King</i> until my parents couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore.&rdquo; He chuckled at himself, then continued. &ldquo;I think they eventually broke the tape on purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan pictured it - a tiny Phil sat in front of a shitty &lsquo;90s television, dressed in absolutely horrendous &lsquo;90s fashion, and singing along at the top of his lungs. He was probably dreadfully off-key even then. </p><p>He laughed at the mental image, glancing over at Phil as if trying to picture this adult man in the same situation. &ldquo;That sounds cute as fuck, Phil,&rdquo; he said through the laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it really?&rdquo; Phil asked, sounding surprised. &rdquo;Seems a bit annoying, if you ask me. My parents certainly thought so,&rdquo; Phil mused.</p><p>Dan shook his head, and snuck another glance at Phil. </p><p>&ldquo;Definitely cute as fuck,&rdquo; Dan adamantly assured Phil. He was almost offended that anyone could be annoyed with Phil. &ldquo;And you know what, <i>The Lion King </i>is amazing, so we are gonna sing it right now, on the way to Disney, because we are adults and no one can stop us,&rdquo; he declared.</p><p><i>Shit, what if he doesn&rsquo;t want to, though?</i></p><p>Dan quickly side-eyed Phil, saying, &ldquo;You know, if you want, that is. We don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>But Dan&rsquo;s concern was unnecessary, as Phil was already grinning and pulling out his phone to find the soundtrack.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it now, Howell. The offer has been made and there&rsquo;s no going back,&rdquo; Phil said just as &ldquo;The Circle of Life&rdquo; began to play from his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Naaaaaaans lasagna baby itsy baby!&rdquo; Phil sang along loudly. He was extremely pitchy, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to care.</p><p>&ldquo;What the <i>fuck</i>, Phil!&rdquo; Dan yelled through a hyena laugh. &ldquo;Those <i>so</i> aren&rsquo;t the lyrics, oh my <i>god</i>!&rdquo; </p><p>Phil ignored him and continued to sing, moving to the background chorus &ldquo;lyrics&rdquo;: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a llama, penguin and a llama. It&rsquo;s a llama, penguin and a llama.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan laughed harder, doing his best to keep his attention primarily focused on the road. </p><p><i>He&rsquo;s having so much fun with this. I bet it&rsquo;d make him happy if I sing like that, too.</i></p><p>Dan would do pretty much anything to make Phil smile, so he joined in, singing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a llama, penguin and a llama&rdquo; just as loudly and carelessly as Phil.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Dan could see Phil turn his head to look at him. Dan felt himself absolutely <i>melting</i> under the fond giddiness in Phil&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p><i>Today&rsquo;s gonna be such a good day.</i></p><p>They spent a majority of the drive singing along to various Disney songs, sticking to <i>The Lion King</i> at first but expanding to some of their other Disney favorites like <i>Mulan </i>(Dan loved singing his dramatic rendition of &ldquo;Reflection&rdquo;) and <i>The Little Mermaid </i>(they couldn&rsquo;t <i>not</i>. Phil was Prince Eric, after all). </p><p>&ldquo;So, I told you what my favorite Disney movie growing up was, now it&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; Phil began as the last note of &ldquo;Under the Sea&rdquo; faded away. &ldquo;What did your poor parents have to put up with?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan blushed, his eyes darting over to glance at Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of embarrassing.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil scoffed. &ldquo;Impossible. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s perfectly endearing.&rdquo; Dan shook his head but Phil continued, sounding almost petulant. &ldquo;Either way, you have to tell me because I already told you mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes, but gave in. Phil could probably make him give into anything. &ldquo;Okay, fine. My favorite Disney cartoon was Winnie the Pooh. It&rsquo;s lit<i>-tra-</i>ly why I have such a posh accent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awwwwww, I love Winnie the Pooh!&rdquo; Phil cooed. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t my favorite, but he was so wonderful.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan glanced over, surprised by Phil&rsquo;s enthusiastic reaction. Phil was already staring back at him with a small, fond smile.</p><p>Just as Dan was about to speak up, maybe change the subject because he still felt a bit embarrassed, Phil spoke again. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m not all that surprised your favorite was Winnie the Pooh. You kind of remind me of him, in a way,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. </p><p>Dan smiled, but couldn&rsquo;t keep the confusion out of his expression, his head tilting to the side slightly and his eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>&ldquo;I really remind you of Winnie the Pooh?&rdquo; Dan asked, baffled.</p><p>In his peripheral vision, Dan caught a glimpse of Phil. Phil was staring out the window like he was deep in thought, scrunching up his eyebrows slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this kind of calm chillness about you, but I still know you&rsquo;ll work hard to get what you want. Like, you work for what you care about but still take it easy every now and then, if that makes sense. And you seem to care a lot about your friends, which is very Pooh.&rdquo; </p><p>There was a thoughtfulness and sincerity to his voice that caught Dan off guard. <i>How does he know that about me already? Does he really pay that much attention?</i> Warmth filled Dan as he considered that maybe Phil liked him as much as he liked Phil.</p><p>But then Phil grinned, continuing cheekily, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m pretty sure what you want usually isn&rsquo;t a pot of honey.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out a snort. &ldquo;<i>Most</i> of that was actually very perceptive of you,&rdquo; he replied fondly, glancing over at Phil with a soft smile. </p><p>Phil shrugged. &ldquo;No, not really. It&rsquo;s not that hard to recognize that you&rsquo;ve never taken a pot of honey to work,&rdquo; he tried to say casually, but he couldn&rsquo;t quite keep the amusement from his voice.</p><p>Dan groaned and rolled his eyes, but he laughed affectionately. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a dork!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s a dork!&rdquo; Phil retorted in a faux-defensive tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi, you leave my mum out of this!&rdquo; Dan laughed, reaching over to poke Phil&rsquo;s leg.</p><p>The conversation dissolved into laughter and more meaningless, but fun, banter. Dan lost track of the time, his brain in autopilot as he drove them the rest of the way to Disney, and he found himself almost sad when they arrived. The drive had gone so well, what if things got awkward when they were wandering around?</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s worry didn&rsquo;t last long, however, as Phil continued to talk just as he had in the car. As they walked into the park, they made a quick list of rides they <i>had</i> to go on, and then they were off.</p><p>Creepy dolls sang &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Small World&rdquo; to them (Phil regretted that suggestion; he told Dan he definitely gave himself nightmare material for weeks), they journeyed through the Caribbean with cunning pirates to find Spanish gold, and they took a tour through Neverland. Each ride had a long enough line that they could talk for a short while, but they didn&rsquo;t feel like they were wasting the day just waiting around.</p><p>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was definitely Phil&rsquo;s favorite. He made Dan go on it three times in a row. And because Phil just looked too adorable when he was excited (his eyes lit up as he smiled and bounced on the balls of his feet, insisting they had to <i>go go go again right now, it&rsquo;s so fun!</i>), Dan couldn&rsquo;t say no. Plus, it was kind of a small cart and they were rather tall. Dan wasn&rsquo;t about to give up the chance to be squished into Phil&rsquo;s side.</p><p>They wandered into Liberty Square for lunch. Dan had timed it perfectly, because it was just before a parade was supposed to begin. He thought Phil might enjoy seeing the characters and hearing the music as a guest rather than an employee for once, since he was always so excited about the magic of Disney. Dan <i>loved</i> it when the magic would excite Phil; Phil&rsquo;s inner child would shine through, lighting up his face and making him giggle in wonder.</p><p>&ldquo;We <i>have</i> to go to Sleepy Hollow,&rdquo; Dan insisted as he pointed to the restaurant with one hand, excitedly tapping Phil&rsquo;s arm with his other. &ldquo;They have the best damn chicken and waffles you will ever have in your life, and there&rsquo;s a little picnic area so we can watch the parade go by.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more of a pancakes man, to be honest,&rdquo; Phil said dubiously. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll trust you.&rdquo; He flashed Dan a wide smile.</p><p>&ldquo;These are so much more than a breakfast food, Phil, they are <i>art</i>. They make sandwiches out of the waffle and put this spicy chicken inside and-&rdquo; Dan moaned theatrically- &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it, it&rsquo;s just <i>so good</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, lead the way!&rdquo; Phil conceded, and gestured for Dan to go ahead of him. Dan reached behind him and pulled Phil after him by the forearm as he hurriedly made his way into the restaurant.</p><p>Phil let Dan pick his waffle for him, and then took out his wallet to pay.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, no, put that away!&rdquo; Dan insisted, pushing Phil&rsquo;s arm down. &ldquo;I asked you out, so I&rsquo;m paying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo; Phil started, his hand still reaching into his wallet.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; Dan lightly hip-checked Phil out of the way and handed his card over to the cashier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this, okay?&rdquo; He turned to look at Phil again to see him rolling his eyes, which worried him until he noticed Phil&rsquo;s small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ridiculous, but okay.&rdquo; Phil gave Dan&rsquo;s shoulder a mini shove to retaliate for the hip-check.</p><p>A few minutes later, they retrieved the waffles and sat down at a table near the edge of the patio so they could see the parade when it came.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready for your life to change dramatically?&rdquo; Dan asked seriously as they each picked up their waffle sandwiches.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, now I&rsquo;m a little scared. That&rsquo;s a lot of pressure riding on this one sandwich,&rdquo; Phil teased. He eyed the sandwich skeptically, eyes narrowed in distrust.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s deserved, believe me,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Come on, then. I&rsquo;m waiting for your reaction.&rdquo; Dan leaned in closer and stared at Phil eagerly, holding his breath.</p><p>Phil eyed his sandwich with a curious expression - part wary and part excited - before he leaned in, opened his mouth wide, and took a big bite. </p><p>He seemed to consider for a moment, and then his eyes widened comically. He looked at Dan with pure wonder on his face. His lips were tilting up into a smile, even though his mouth was full of food.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dan said, nodding seriously.</p><p>&ldquo;How - it&rsquo;s - oh my god,&rdquo; Phil groaned around his bite of food.</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i>,&rdquo; Dan laughed. He leaned back in his seat, relieved at Phil&rsquo;s reaction. &ldquo;You like it, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded vigorously, already going in for another bite.</p><p>Dan laughed again, then took a bite of his own sandwich and moaned at the flavor.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really spicy but it&rsquo;s so good,&rdquo; Phil managed when he finally swallowed. He chugged a few gulps of water, then dove back into the sandwich.</p><p>Dan felt a strange sense of pride well up in him. Phil had trusted Dan&rsquo;s suggestion and it paid off <i>brilliantly</i>. </p><p>Just then, the front of the parade passed by their seating area. The magic of seeing the characters wasn&rsquo;t as strong for Dan or Phil now that they&rsquo;ve done parades and meet and greets before, but that didn&rsquo;t stop them from enjoying it. Mickey Mouse waved at them, and Phil squealed in delight.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Mickey!&rdquo; he called excitedly, bouncing in his seat a bit and waving his arm wildly.</p><p><i>He&rsquo;s so precious, oh my god</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Mickey Mouse waved at me, Dan! I feel special,&rdquo; Phil exclaimed, looking at Dan with the gleeful excitement of a child.</p><p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; Dan said softly. His body was frozen, his hands half-raised to his mouth with the last few bites of his waffle sandwich, but his eyes wandered Phil&rsquo;s face, taking in the joy and giddiness. Phil&rsquo;s happiness was infectious, and Dan found himself smiling affectionately at this excitable man who had somehow agreed to go on a date with <i>Dan</i>, of all people.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face flushed, and he broke eye contact for a moment to look down at his food tray, then cautiously looked back up at Dan through his lashes. Dan felt a fresh surge of affection as he saw how bashful Phil got at the compliment. </p><p>They stared at each other silently for a moment, faces turning redder by the second, until Dan cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;So, uh, you liked the waffle, then?&rdquo; He pointed at the sticky mess left on the tray where Phil&rsquo;s sandwich used to be.</p><p>Phil nodded. &ldquo;Life-changing, as advertised. Thanks for the suggestion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you liked it,&rdquo; Dan replied. He cleared his throat again. &ldquo;So, after the parade crowd clears out a bit, do you wanna go to the Haunted Mansion?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Phil agreed. </p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the crowd to disperse once the parade ended, and then Dan and Phil were off to find the Haunted Mansion.</p><p>On the way, they encountered a traffic jam where some families were apparently meeting a character. A huge crowd of people stood in the way, blocking the whole path. Dan felt a twinge of sympathy for the handler, knowing how hard it could be to keep a crowd under control, especially in walkways. As a handler, he hated when people tried to force their way through, but he was a man on a mission. He&rsquo;d just try not to be too aggressive.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go for it,&rdquo; Dan decided, already sending mental apologies to the handler. &ldquo;Stay close?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nodded, and Dan pushed himself into the small gaps between people with Phil on his heels.</p><p>Except Phil wasn&rsquo;t quite as on-his-heels as he expected. Dan had moved a little too fast for Phil to keep up in such a cramped space. A hand grasped onto Dan&rsquo;s wrist, and he jumped, glancing back quickly to see Phil&rsquo;s arm outstretched. </p><p><i>Phil&rsquo;s basically holding my hand. It&rsquo;s fine, nothing to worry about. Totally cool over here. It&rsquo;s all good.</i></p><p>They finally broke free of the crowd and could stand next to each other again. Dan expected Phil to drop his wrist now that they had room to maneuver, but he didn&rsquo;t. Instead, Phil&rsquo;s hand slid down to lace their fingers together.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s heart beat faster, and he stared down at their clasped hands. <i>Be cool, Dan, he&rsquo;s just holding your hand.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo; Phil asked tentatively.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s head snapped up to make eye contact. Phil was blushing and looked like he was making a concerted effort not to hide his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm? The hands? Yes, that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s - it&rsquo;s great. Perfect, really.&rdquo; Dan fumbled, flustered.</p><p><i>I said be cool, that is </i>not<i> being cool</i>.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s free hand rose up to cover his mouth slightly, trying to hide a giggle, but the crows feet around his eyes gave him away.</p><p>&ldquo;Nooooo, don&rsquo;t laugh at me!&rdquo; Dan whined.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Phil said through his laughter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just too adorable.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s cheeks were definitely bright red by now. &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; he grumbled. He stuck out his bottom lip in an exaggerated pout. </p><p>&ldquo;Awwww,&rdquo; Phil cooed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really not making me think you&rsquo;re less adorable, if that was the goal.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out an exaggerated huff and walked slightly ahead of Phil - just far enough ahead to keep up his dramatic charade, but close enough that they could still hold hands.</p><p>They arrived at the Haunted Mansion line and worked their way to the front. Along the way, Dan and Phil took turns reading out all of the silly tombstones of the dead residents. Every so often, Phil would laugh at one of the funny ways of dying and say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; </p><p>On the ride itself, Dan cozied up to Phil as much as he dare. The seats were much bigger than Big Thunder Railroad and he - unfortunately - didn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> to squish into Phil&rsquo;s side in order to fit. He didn&rsquo;t want to drape himself all over Phil, but he wanted to be as close as was reasonably possible, so he settled for sitting close enough that their sides touched from shoulder to knee.</p><p><i>Is this too much? Is he uncomfortable? Oh, god, this was a mistake, wasn&rsquo;t it.</i></p><p>But then Phil&rsquo;s foot bumped Dan&rsquo;s, nudging it gently before hooking his ankle around Dan&rsquo;s.</p><p>Dan looked at Phil, happy to know that apparently Phil wanted to be close just as much as Dan, but Phil was steadfastly observing the other side of their cart. Dan rolled his eyes fondly and relaxed into the chair.</p><p>Their cart turned a corner, and the ride properly began. </p><p>Some of the spooks startled Phil throughout the ride, and Dan laughed at him for it.</p><p>&ldquo;Really, Phil? How didn&rsquo;t you expect that to pop up?&rdquo; Dan would tease, squeezing Phil&rsquo;s hand briefly.</p><p>&ldquo;Shhhh, I just wasn&rsquo;t paying enough attention!&rdquo; Phil would reply, squeezing right back.</p><p>About halfway through the ride, the cart spun around and began descending a sharp hill backwards. Gravity squished Dan and Phil to the middle of the seat, right up against each other.</p><p>Dan breathed in sharply as their bodies pressed together even more than they already had been, and he quickly looked over at Phil&rsquo;s face. Phil was already looking at him, blushing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Phil whispered shyly. He flexed his fingers around Dan&rsquo;s before squeezing gently.</p><p>Equally shyly, Dan squeezed Phil&rsquo;s hand and whispered, &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;</p><p>When the cart straightened out, neither of them made any effort to readjust to sit farther away from the other. Dan felt his heart soar when he realized that meant Phil wanted to be close to him, too.</p><p>Not long after, the ride came to an end. Phil let go of Dan&rsquo;s hand to climb out of the cart, then reached back to offer his hand as a support as Dan followed.</p><p>&ldquo;How gentlemanly,&rdquo; Dan commented with a slight quirk of his lips. Inside, he was gushing about how sweet Phil was and how much he loved the feeling of the soft skin of Phil&rsquo;s hand against his own. He worried Phil would let go of his hand as soon as he got off the ride, but Phil only adjusted his grip to interlock their fingers again. He brushed his thumb over Dan&rsquo;s knuckles, and butterflies erupted in Dan&rsquo;s stomach.</p><p>As they left the Haunted Mansion set, they debated where to go next.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s vote was the Winnie the Pooh ride.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s such a cute one! Besides, you said you loved Pooh!&rdquo; Phil eagerly suggested.</p><p>Dan laughed and let Phil pull him across the park to the ride.</p><p><i>He wants to make me happy so much. I&rsquo;m supposed to be making sure we go on rides </i>he<i> likes but he&rsquo;s over here pushing me to do something for personal nostalgia&rsquo;s sake. He&rsquo;s so sweet.</i></p><p>Fortunately, the line wasn&rsquo;t too long, so they passed through the interactive buttons and animatronics until they made it to the carts. </p><p>They had to drop their hands to climb into the carts, much to Dan&rsquo;s annoyance, but he relaxed when Phil sat down probably closer than was strictly necessary.</p><p>Phil leaned in to whisper in Dan&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Will you hold my hand if I get scared?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan let out a loud laugh, turning his head to look at Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just Winnie the Pooh, so I doubt that&rsquo;ll be a problem.&rdquo; His hand found Phil&rsquo;s anyway as the ride began to move, already desperate for the comforting warmth and the accompanying rush of giddy excitement that Dan was beginning to associate with holding Phil&rsquo;s hand. Dan felt a grin breaking out on his face, playing it off as excitement for Winnie the Pooh. He looked around at the walls, quickly reading the giant storybook page that set up the story for the ride.</p><p>Just before they entered the ride, Dan looked back at Phil with a soft smile and quietly admitted, &ldquo;I like holding your hand, even if you aren&rsquo;t scared.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil bit his lip around a giddy smile, and Dan&rsquo;s heart just about melted at the sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Oi, you&rsquo;ll miss the ride if you keep looking at me,&rdquo; Phil complained, nudging Dan&rsquo;s elbow with his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, but I really like looking at you. Especially when I get you to blush like that,&rdquo; Dan teased, nudging Phil&rsquo;s shoulder playfully. He relented, though, deciding to enjoy the ride as Phil insisted.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a particularly thrilling ride, by any means. There were a few jerky turns and wobbles, but no dips or spins, and the pace was fairly slow. They both giggled as the ride bounced up and down, mimicking Tigger&rsquo;s bouncing.</p><p>Dan loved it anyway, partly because of the nostalgia of Winnie the Pooh and partly because of how into it Phil was. He never was <i>actually</i> scared, but he pretended to be when they came to the section of Heffalumps and Woozles, squeezing Dan&rsquo;s hand harder and bringing his other arm to hug Dan&rsquo;s. Phil&rsquo;s head came to rest on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder, and Dan went perfectly still.</p><p><i>Oh my god. He&rsquo;s so precious. Don&rsquo;t move, Dan, or he&rsquo;ll move</i>.</p><p>Luckily, it seemed that Phil had no intention of moving away from Dan for the rest of the ride. He stayed snuggled up to Dan&rsquo;s arm for the last few minutes of the story, then reluctantly detached himself as their cart came to the end. </p><p>&ldquo;That was a great idea, Phil. I&rsquo;m glad you dragged me over here,&rdquo; Dan said happily as they exited the track area. He couldn&rsquo;t get the dopey smile off his face.</p><p>Phil gasped, ignoring Dan entirely in favor of pointing to the alcove next to the ride and tugging on their still-clasped hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Look! Tigger and Pooh are there for photos!&rdquo; He turned to Dan, expression extremely serious. &ldquo;We have to go get pictures with them.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was on the verge of saying no. They most likely knew whoever it was in the costumes, so some of the magic was already missing from the experience. Besides, it would <i>definitely</i> be weird if two awkwardly tall adult men got in line to meet <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>.</p><p>But Phil looked so excited and happy, Dan couldn&rsquo;t find it in himself to decline. Instead, he sighed in mock exasperation and gestured for Phil to lead the way.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s face lit up even more, making Dan smile and shake his head fondly. </p><p><i>He&rsquo;s such a dork. I love that he&rsquo;s so willing to let himself be a kid at Disney. He really makes the magic come to life.</i></p><p>The line to meet Pooh and Tigger was significantly longer than the line for the ride had been, so they occupied their time by sharing anecdotes about their childhood experiences. Phil had several stories about the crazy things he did or believed as a kid, like how he thought the &ldquo;D&rdquo; in the Disney logo was actually a &ldquo;G&rdquo; or how crowds cheering at football matches scared him to the point of tears.</p><p>(Dan, of course, found this very endearing and jokingly promised he would never cheer at a football match in front of Phil.)</p><p>In exchange, Dan told Phil a few stories about some of his more embarrassing failures and awkward moments growing up, like how he got fired from his last job for selling an axe to a twelve-year-old. </p><p>Finally, they made it to the front of the line and got to meet Tigger and Pooh. They each got to hug both characters, much to Phil&rsquo;s delight. Before they took the picture, they also got to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; with the animals. Neither character could actually say anything, but Tigger had some <i>very</i> articulate gestures.</p><p>He looked at Dan, then pointed back and forth between Dan and Phil, who was having an animated conversation with Pooh and completely unaware of the attention. Dan wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure, but he thought maybe Tigger had caught on to their affection. Sure enough, Tigger placed both hands over his heart and tilted his head.</p><p>Blushing, Dan laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re here on a date,&rdquo; he confirmed in a low voice, trying not to attract Phil&rsquo;s attention away from where he talked with Pooh. It wasn&rsquo;t that the date was a secret, Dan just felt a little self-conscious that he was talking to one of his childhood idols - and probably coworkers, honestly - about a <i>date</i>.</p><p>Tigger gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up - or at least the closest thing he could get to a thumbs up in his costume. He took Dan&rsquo;s hand to guide him to Phil, made them hold hands, then moved to stand on the other side of Phil. Pooh stood next to Dan, and they were ready for pictures.</p><p>Dan and Phil both blushed profusely at Tigger&rsquo;s antics, even though they&rsquo;d already been holding hands all day. It was just a different experience when someone else noticed their feelings and nudged them together, showing Dan that maybe they <i>did</i> work well together. Plus, Dan realized that he was about to actually take a picture while <i>holding hands with Phil</i>, which would immortalize this perfect moment.</p><p>They took a few nice pictures with Pooh and Tigger, then bade them goodbye and left the meeting spot, still hand-in-hand.</p><p>&ldquo;That was amazing! Tigger saw right through us, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Phil chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;He definitely did,&rdquo; Dan agreed. He swung their clasped hands around slightly, enjoying the sensation of the contact. Casually, he added, &ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s anybody we know today&hellip; We&rsquo;ll <i>definitely</i> be hearing about this at work later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shhhh!&rdquo; Phil clapped a hand over Dan&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>Tigger</i>, not somebody we know!&rdquo; he scolded, shaking his head in mock disappointment.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and smiled under Phil&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Of course, how could I ever forget,&rdquo; he deadpanned, though it came out warbled and muffled.</p><p>Phil narrowed his eyes at Dan suspiciously, then nodded once. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you said, but I&rsquo;ll take it as an apology. No more ruining the magic, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sighed dramatically, then nodded. </p><p>Letting out a satisfied hum, Phil dropped his hand from Dan&rsquo;s mouth and looking around at their surroundings. His eyes landed on the gift shop for Winnie the Pooh, and he immediately started pulling Dan towards it. &ldquo;I just had the best idea!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I like where you&rsquo;re going with this, love, the look on your face screams mischief,&rdquo; Dan said warily.</p><p><i>Did I just call him &ldquo;love&rdquo;? Oh shit, it is definitely too soon for pet names like that. Shit, that was too much.</i></p><p>But Phil didn&rsquo;t comment on it. If anything, his smile got wider as he mercilessly tugged Dan along. </p><p>&ldquo;Shh, trust me! This will be amazing, I promise.&rdquo; Phil sounded particularly excited about this idea of his. </p><p>When they entered the shop, Phil made straight for the back wall. He let go of Dan&rsquo;s hand to pick up two Mickey Mouse ear hats, one Tigger and one Pooh.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m buying these and we&rsquo;ll match for the rest of the day,&rdquo; Phil declared adamantly, sounding like he&rsquo;d already made up his mind.</p><p>Dan blinked in shock, glancing quickly from Phil to the hats and back again. &ldquo;Um, what? Phil, those are, like, $30 each. I can&rsquo;t let you get them for both of us on a date I asked you to, that would be ungentlemanly!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p><p>Phil giggled. &ldquo;You think I care about that? You&rsquo;ve already been such a gentleman so far. You bought lunch and everything! Besides, <i>I</i> want to get them. It was my idea, anyway, it&rsquo;s only right I pay for them. Plus, you&rsquo;re forgetting that we get a cast member discount, silly. Come on, please?&rdquo; Phil stuck out his bottom lip and opened his eyes wider in a puppy pout. </p><p>Dan hesitated, momentarily distracted by how endearing that expression was, before contemplating the issue at hand. He didn&rsquo;t want to push it too much and make it seem like he thought Phil couldn&rsquo;t afford the hats or something, but he also didn&rsquo;t want to make Phil pay for them. </p><p><i>Although, he&rsquo;s right - it was his idea. Surely he wouldn&rsquo;t have suggested it if he wasn&rsquo;t willing and expecting to pay for them&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, fine,&rdquo; Dan relented. &ldquo;You can buy us the hats, but I&rsquo;m buying dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You already paid for lunch, though!&rdquo; Phil exclaimed with a tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not necessary-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I want to treat you,&rdquo; Dan mumbled sheepishly, tugging gently on Phil&rsquo;s hand. He looked up at Phil through his lashes as he continued, &ldquo;I want you to feel special today, you know? This should all be about you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s free hand reached up and brushed some of Phil&rsquo;s drooping quiff off his forehead, eventually resting his hand on Phil&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p>Phil nuzzled into Dan&rsquo;s hand slightly, looking a little conflicted for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, alright then, if you insist. You can pay for dinner later. But right now, I&rsquo;m going to get these hats and make everyone jealous of our relationship,&rdquo; Phil announced with a flare.</p><p><i>Relationship? Does that mean he wants to be boyfriends? Is it too early for that? I mean&hellip; I think I want that, but does he? I know we&rsquo;re still only on the first date, but this feels so </i>natural<i> that it would just make sense to make it official, wouldn&rsquo;t it? </i></p><p>Dan decided to tuck the questions away for now, swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat as he followed closely behind Phil to the registers.</p><p>Phil quickly paid and picked up the hats from the counter, turning to face Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, then, let&rsquo;s see it on you. May I?&rdquo; Phil asked, gesturing towards Dan&rsquo;s head with the Pooh hat and smiling.</p><p><i>My hair is going to hate this&hellip;</i></p><p>Dan leaned forward in answer, presenting his head for Phil. Phil slowly fixed the hat over Dan&rsquo;s head, placing the chin strap under his chin to secure it in place. He reached up and messed with his hair, carefully pulling out a few strands from under the hat. Usually, Dan wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone fix his hair for him because he alone knew how to make it look good, but he didn&rsquo;t complain as Phil fluffed the exposed ends. Somehow, he felt like he could trust Phil to do it right. After a lingering moment, Phil pulled his hands away, and Dan tilted his head back up so Phil could inspect the results.</p><p>He inhaled sharply and stared at Dan with an unreadable expression.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Does it look weird?&rdquo; Dan asked, suddenly nervous. He took out his phone to use the camera as a mirror. </p><p>It actually wasn&rsquo;t too bad; his hair was definitely more of a mess now, but he actually looked fairly good with the hat.</p><p>Dan looked back up to see Phil still staring at him, now with a beaming smile.</p><p>Dan blushed at the attention, and Phil cooed.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew this would be a good idea. You look fantastic,&rdquo; Phil assured Dan, reaching up a hand again and gently brushing his fingers through the visible floof of hair poking out from under the hat. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Dan mumbled, feeling the blush continue to burn on his cheeks.</p><p>Phil smiled brightly at him, then dropped his hand from Dan&rsquo;s hair. </p><p>&ldquo;My turn!&rdquo; Phil thrust the Tigger hat towards Dan&rsquo;s hand, then tilted his head down so Dan could put the hat on him.</p><p>Dan stretched the elastic over Phil&rsquo;s chin and pushed the hat back onto Phil&rsquo;s head. He brushed his fingers through Phil&rsquo;s quiff to make sure his hair wouldn&rsquo;t look weird, marvelling at the softness for a moment, then removed his hands.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s head tilted back up, and he was grinning, and his face was <i>so close</i> to Dan&rsquo;s that, for a moment, Dan&rsquo;s brain short-circuited.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Phil giggled.</p><p>The giggle was enough to pull Dan&rsquo;s brain back together in a flurry of thoughts.</p><p><i>Great, my cheeks are going to be permanently pink around Phil, apparently</i>.<i> It doesn&rsquo;t help that he looks unfairly pretty in that Tigger hat with his stupid gorgeous quiff poking out just a little and he looks so excited and happy and wait what did he say again? Was I supposed to respond? Oh yeah -</i></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Dan awkwardly said a few beats too late.</p><p>Phil giggled again, not seeming to care about Dan&rsquo;s awkwardness, then reached into his pocket for his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a selfie, immortalize the moment,&rdquo; Phil suggested.</p><p><i>Oh my god, yes. We are too cute, and I need a picture of Phil looking like this so I can look back on this moment and absolutely melt. He looks so happy.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it, if you want. I&rsquo;ve mastered the perfect selfie angle with my noodle arms,&rdquo; Dan joked, stepping closer to Phil.</p><p>Dan expected Phil to just stand next to him, but apparently Phil was in the mood to murder Dan because he stood closer than he really had to for the picture and then reached out an arm to wrap it around Dan&rsquo;s waist.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s selfie arm faltered briefly at the sensation of Phil&rsquo;s warm arm on his body. He barely bit back a surprised squeak, since he knew that would make Phil think he was uncomfortable and he&rsquo;d move his arm. That was the last thing Dan wanted. Phil&rsquo;s half-embrace felt so strong and comforting and <i>safe</i>, Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d ever be able to survive when Phil eventually moved.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Dan asked, voice a little shaky.</p><p>&ldquo;Yee!&rdquo; Phil replied.</p><p>Dan snapped a few photos, changing the angle slightly to try to capture the perfect shot. Normally, for a picture like this, he would give a half-smile, or maybe a smirk, but right now? There was no way he could keep the ridiculous grin from his face.</p><p>And then Phil turned his head and kissed Dan right on the cheek as Dan snapped a picture. Dan&rsquo;s eyes widened and his mouth dropped open in shock.</p><p><i>Did he just - he&rsquo;s still - oh my god. Oh my </i>GOD. <i>Okay, okay, okay, shhhhh, calm down before he gets weird about it, come on, get it together, Dan.</i></p><p>A flaming red blush spread across Dan&rsquo;s cheeks and his mouth spread in a face-splitting grin for the last few pictures Dan took. Butterflies zoomed around his stomach like they were trying to escape, and a few seemed to find their way out as giggles. A few of the giggles erupted from Dan&rsquo;s throat, and he covered his mouth with his hand to prevent any more from escaping</p><p>Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say as Phil pulled away from his cheek. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure where to <i>look</i>. He could still feel Phil&rsquo;s strong arm around his waist, and it made thinking difficult. His thoughts swirled wildly as he tried to figure out what to do. Should he look at Phil and let him see how Dan was still reeling? Should he run away? Should he act like nothing happened and look at the pictures? And would he ever stop grinning like a madman?</p><p>He opted for sending Phil a shy, happy glance, then pretending like nothing had happened (which was a little hard to do around his grin, but he tried to ignore that detail). He cleared his throat and looked at his phone, opening the photos app and scrolling through the selfies he took.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s probably at least one good one in here,&rdquo; Dan said to distract himself. He looked through the pictures, quickly skimming past the ones where Phil was kissing him to find the first photos.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait - Phil! You&rsquo;re not even looking at the phone in any of these!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, looking over at his date in mock irritation.</p><p>Phil was already looking at him with a fond smile. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not looking at the phone. How could I, when you&rsquo;re here in front of me?&rdquo; he asked softly. His face was open and honest, and the fond smile twitched until it grew into a full grin.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s cheeks darkened again. He opened his mouth to respond, but all that came out was a sort of strangled, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil giggled, his tongue poking through his teeth.</p><p><i>How does he keep getting more and more adorable, oh my god</i>. <i>This man will be the death of me.</i></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s arm dropped from around Dan&rsquo;s waist, much to Dan&rsquo;s disappointment.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on! We&rsquo;ve got more rides to go on!&rdquo; Phil reminded him gleefully. </p><p>He quickly re-discovered Dan&rsquo;s hand (making butterflies zoom around in his stomach again) and began pulling him out of the shop again, already going on about how he wanted to go on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad again.</p><p>Dan shook his head fondly, but followed Phil anyway.</p><p>A few hours later, they had ridden all Phil&rsquo;s favorites another time as well as the Winnie the Pooh ride, this time with their Pooh and Tigger ear hats, and they realized they were both starving.</p><p>They meandered over to Pinocchio&rsquo;s Village Haus for a quick dinner (Phil got chicken nuggets, which Dan found endearing as hell), and then headed back out for a few more roller coasters before they had to find a spot for the fireworks.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, I know you love the roller coasters, but we really have to go pick our place to watch the fireworks!&rdquo; Dan laughed, tugging Phil&rsquo;s arm to get him to stay out of the line for the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> ride. &ldquo;Besides, we&rsquo;ve already been on this one three times. Haven&rsquo;t you had enough?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can never have too many pirates, Pooh!&rdquo; Phil exclaimed excitedly. He tugged right back on Dan&rsquo;s arm in a desperate attempt to return to the <i>Pirates</i> ride.</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes in exasperation. &ldquo;But the whole point of coming here was to show you the fireworks!&rdquo; He stuck out his bottom lip in a pout and batted his eyes at Phil. &ldquo;Pwease, Phiw?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awwww, now that&rsquo;s just cheating,&rdquo; Phil whined. He pouted in return, but Dan wasn&rsquo;t having it.</p><p>Dan jutted his bottom lip out even further, and Phil cracked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, alright then,&rdquo; Phil sighed. &ldquo;Lead the way.&rdquo; </p><p>A smug grin made its way onto Dan&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. Follow me, my liege,&rdquo; Dan said with a mock bow. He took a great deal of joy in the soft giggle he heard Phil make.</p><p>When Phil had agreed to the date, Dan had immediately made sure to reserve them a spot in front of Cinderella&rsquo;s Castle, where the view would be best. They headed to that area now, waiting for an attendant to allow them into the reserved section directly in front of the castle.</p><p>Even though it was still light out, there was a long line of people waiting to get into the reserved area, so Dan and Phil took their place at the back and hunkered down to wait.</p><p>&ldquo;So, where do the fireworks come from, again? Like, which way should I be looking?&rdquo; Phil asked, inspecting the area around them as if he expected a firework to go off any moment.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole song and show and everything that&rsquo;ll be around the Castle,&rdquo; Dan told him. </p><p>Phil nodded absentmindedly, still looking around the park. </p><p>Dan took the quiet moment to appreciate the memories of the day. He thought about how excited Phil had been that morning, and how happy Phil had been when he learned that Dan loved Winnie the Pooh, and how insistent Phil was about the Winnie the Pooh-themed hats they were both still wearing. Dan thought about how <i>good</i> and <i>right</i> the whole day had felt, with the never-ending conversation and playful flirting and hand-holding. <i>God</i>, the <i>handholding</i>. He couldn&rsquo;t get enough of the feeling of his hand gently clutched by Phil&rsquo;s. Sometimes, Phil would run his thumb over Dan&rsquo;s knuckles, sending all coherent thought flying desperately from his brain and attracting all the blood to his cheeks, making it painfully obvious how much he <i>adored</i> Phil&rsquo;s actions. </p><p>As they waited for the fireworks, Dan tentatively moved his own thumb over Phil&rsquo;s hand, wondering if Phil would have a similar reaction to Dan. The blinding smile Phil sent Dan told him that yes, Phil liked that just as much as Dan.</p><p>Phil took a small step in so their sides were entirely pressed up against each other, then leaned in to be even closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Phil whispered with a light smile. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s been great.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan beamed. The whole goal of the day had been to make Phil as happy as possible. He was proud to say that he firmly believed he had accomplished that goal, and they hadn&rsquo;t even seen the fireworks yet.</p><p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t seen the fireworks yet. That was supposed to be the great part of the day,&rdquo; Dan reminded him.</p><p>Phil laughed gently, reaching up his free hand to carefully cup Dan&rsquo;s cheek. Dan&rsquo;s heartbeat quickened as he subconsciously leaned into the touch.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Dan,&rdquo; Phil sighed happily. &ldquo;The great part was spending time with you, no matter what we did.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s thumb caressed Dan&rsquo;s cheek, and Dan&rsquo;s brain shorted out.</p><p><i>He- I- Great? My face? His hand? My god.</i></p><p>Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, all Dan could think to say was a breathy, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s responding laugh brushed delicately against Dan&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Speechless, Howell? That&rsquo;s surprising,&rdquo; he teased. &ldquo;I like seeing you all flustered. I&rsquo;ll have to keep making it happen.&rdquo; He winked at Dan in his special Phil way, where it&rsquo;s more of a blink than a wink, then let go of Dan entirely and turned towards the line, which had finally moved forward to allow people into the reserved section.</p><p>Dan blinked in surprise. </p><p><i>What just happened? I didn&rsquo;t even notice the line move. What is this boy </i>doing<i> to me?</i></p><p>He shook himself slightly, quickly catching up to Phil and re-clasping their hands.</p><p><i>Should I address what just happened? What would I even say? I&rsquo;m not sure I know what happened, anyway. </i></p><p>Dan chanced a glance at Phil and saw a smirk playing at his lips.</p><p><i>That&rsquo;s a dangerous smirk. He looks mischievous - he&rsquo;s way too pleased with himself. It&rsquo;s probably best if I just move on, before I make more of a fool of myself.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; he began, louder than he expected. He winced internally, begging himself to be less awkward. Clearing his throat, he tried again, lowering his voice to a normal volume this time. &ldquo;So, are you ready to see the most beautiful, captivating thing you will ever see?&rdquo;</p><p>A full smirk formed on Phil&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already seen him. He&rsquo;s actually somehow letting me hold his hand,&rdquo; he said teasingly, swinging their hands pointedly.</p><p>Dan groaned, looking towards the heavens as if asking for God to come save him from this dork, but he couldn&rsquo;t disguise his smile, nor his accompanying blush. &ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i> was cheesy as hell. I walked right into it, too, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; He looked back at Phil with a shake of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;You certainly did.&rdquo; Phil grinned, bumping Dan&rsquo;s shoulder with his own. &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re all blushy again, how adorable!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a menace. A danger to society. Too pure for this world,&rdquo; Dan deadpanned.</p><p>Phil snorted. &ldquo;One of these things is not like the other.&rdquo;</p><p>In a sing-song voice, Dan replied, &ldquo;But all of them describe you perfectly.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil bumped Dan&rsquo;s shoulder again, harder this time. &ldquo;Your mum&rsquo;s a description.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Dan shrieked out in a hyena laugh. &ldquo;That- that doesn&rsquo;t even make sense!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mum doesn&rsquo;t even-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare finish that sentence,&rdquo; Dan warned teasingly. &ldquo;Leave my poor mum alone.&rdquo; To make sure Phil didn&rsquo;t take him too seriously, Dan squeezed his hand lightly. If his heart raced a little faster when Phil squeezed back, well, no one had to know.</p><p>&ldquo;So, where are we going to watch the fireworks from?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>Dan hummed in thought, looking around the open area for a good spot. &ldquo;How about right there?&rdquo; He pointed to a place near the front of the section, but far enough back that they wouldn&rsquo;t block everyone&rsquo;s line of sight with their tallness.</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; Phil agreed with a content nod. </p><p>Phil followed Dan to their spot. Once they got there, Dan hugged Phil&rsquo;s arm with his own free arm and rested his head on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>Dan looked up at Phil from his shoulder. &ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo; Dan asked. He felt Phil nod. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect,&rdquo; came Phil&rsquo;s fond reply. Phil squeezed Dan&rsquo;s hand once, then brushed his thumb over Dan&rsquo;s knuckles again. </p><p>If he hadn&rsquo;t been leaning on Phil already, Dan was sure he would&rsquo;ve fallen over completely in a swoon. Phil somehow knew exactly what to do to make Dan unbelievably happy, and Dan was living for it.</p><p>For a few minutes, they stood in silence, just enjoying each other&rsquo;s presence and the feeling of their bodies pressed together as they waited for the fireworks. </p><p>The lights around the crowd went out, and Cinderella&rsquo;s Castle lit up.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it starting?&rdquo; Phil asked.</p><p>Dan resisted the urge to sass Phil, because <i>honestly, what else could be happening? Disney shut down the park with everyone still in it?</i></p><p>Instead, he hummed quietly in affirmation and snuggled closer into Phil&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>Music began, and the crowd was entranced. Oohs and Ahhs rang out in the plaza with every new animation and special effect. The lights and the music, combined with the magical experience that is spending a day at Disney World, always delivered a spectacular performance.</p><p>But Dan wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention. </p><p>Dan was looking at Phil. Well, some would call it <i>staring</i>, but Dan couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to care. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s expression was so relaxed, so <i>happy</i>. Every new piece to the show had him gasping in delight, a childlike wonder in his eyes. Dan couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p><p>And then Phil seemed to notice that Dan wasn&rsquo;t watching the fireworks. He turned his head slightly, looking at Dan, who was still carefully resting on his shoulder despite the Pooh ears.</p><p>Normally, Dan would&rsquo;ve been embarrassed to be caught staring, but all he could feel was an overwhelming affection for the man who had spent the whole day trying to make sure Dan had a good time, even though Dan was meant to be treating Phil. </p><p>A fond smile grew on Phil&rsquo;s face as he and Dan got lost in each other&rsquo;s gaze. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Phil whispered just loud enough to be heard over the fireworks and music. His free hand moved up and carded through Dan&rsquo;s exposed fringe slowly, then came to rest on his cheek. His thumb delicately traced Dan&rsquo;s cheekbone. </p><p>If he could, Dan would have purred at the gentle motion of Phil&rsquo;s thumb. Instead, he sighed through his nose and leaned into the touch with a smile. He trailed his fingers along Phil&rsquo;s forearm, appreciating how Phil shivered at the sensation. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes quickly flickered over Dan&rsquo;s face, and his smile grew. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty,&rdquo; he stated simply, as if it were just a fact that the whole world should know.</p><p>Dan turned to hide his face in Phil&rsquo;s shoulder in embarrassment. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just say things like that,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;They do weird things to me and make me feel all soft.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hand moved from caressing Dan&rsquo;s face to rest comfortingly on Dan&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true! And I love seeing you blush when I tell you so.&rdquo; Phil wiggled his elbow. &ldquo;Come on, let me see your pretty face.&rdquo;</p><p>Grumbling false complaints, Dan slowly lifted his head to look Phil in the eye.</p><p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; Phil whispered adoringly. He shifted his hand up from Dan&rsquo;s waist to gently cup his face, stroking his cheekbone with his thumb.</p><p>Dan felt his blush intensify and looked away for a moment to try to regain his composure. When he finally felt ready to look at Phil again, he found that Phil&rsquo;s gaze moving slowly over his face, taking in every detail.</p><p>It was a whole new feeling. Dan had realized throughout the day that, yes, Phil did actually kind of like him, but the way Phil looked at him now was so much <i>more</i> - more even than just moments before. This was an intense gaze, which intimidated Dan a little, but mostly he was just overwhelmed with happiness at the brilliant realization that Phil <i>liked him</i>. Dan felt wanted in a way that stretched beyond just the physical, and he was overcome with emotion.</p><p>His eyes could no longer stay still on Phil&rsquo;s. They trailed over his features, just as Phil&rsquo;s were doing to him, and took in the sharp cheekbones, the beaked nose, the freckles and spots, the way his pink lips contrasted his pale skin. And then all he could look at were Phil&rsquo;s lips. Their soft curve into Phil&rsquo;s small half-smile, the way they pouted out slightly. They looked soft. Kissable.</p><p><i>Are they as soft as they look? Would he kiss me if I asked?</i></p><p>Dan somehow managed to pull his eyes up from Phil&rsquo;s mouth to see his eyes instead. He wanted to know what Phil was thinking and know if he had any chance.</p><p>Phil was still looking at Dan&rsquo;s face, but it seemed his sights were stuck on Dan&rsquo;s mouth. Dan felt a shiver course through him when he thought of what Phil might be thinking. His shiver seemed to jolt Phil out of his thoughts, as his eyes snapped up to meet Dan&rsquo;s.</p><p>They stood still. Dan&rsquo;s thoughts were caught in a constant loop of <i>kiss me, kiss me, kiss me</i> as he tried to work up the courage to ask, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure he could bring himself to say the words. </p><p><i>Come on, just ask! You want to, and he seems like he wants to, and you just have to go for it. Just say it. He won&rsquo;t say no. But what if he does? What if I&rsquo;ve been reading the whole situation wrong?</i></p><p>As Dan&rsquo;s internal crisis continued, Phil took a small step forward, eliminating the last traces of space between their bodies. Phil&rsquo;s lips remained ever so slightly apart, like he wasn&rsquo;t sure he had Dan&rsquo;s permission.</p><p>Emboldened by Phil&rsquo;s move, Dan made a decision. Slowly, his eyelids fluttered closed, and he leaned in the smallest bit so their lips brushed.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hand on Dan&rsquo;s cheek slid back into his hair, just below the edge of the Pooh hat, and brushed his fingers through the curls. Dan sighed into the kiss, and Phil&rsquo;s lips moved softly against Dan&rsquo;s. </p><p>It was a little tentative, and their noses bumped together awkwardly at first, but it felt right. They kept it slow and purposeful, just exploring the feeling of each other. Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d ever had such a perfect first kiss, and he drowned in the sensation.</p><p>They pulled apart not too long after the kiss began. Bashful smiles grew on their faces as their eyes opened, and Dan bit his lip in an attempt to keep from grinning too much. Phil&rsquo;s tongue poked between his teeth a little, and Dan&rsquo;s heart melted. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s fingers disentangled from Dan&rsquo;s, and Dan panicked.</p><p><i>He doesn&rsquo;t want to hold my hand anymore? What did I do wrong? Did he hate the kiss? But then why did he smile? What no-</i></p><p>Dan&rsquo;s thoughts were cut off by the feeling of Phil&rsquo;s now-free arm wrapping around Dan&rsquo;s shoulder and pulling him in to cuddle into Phil&rsquo;s side. Phil&rsquo;s other hand found Dan&rsquo;s again, and he clasped them in front of their bodies. </p><p><i>Oh.</i> Dan giggled. <i>That&rsquo;s better, then.</i></p><p>He rested his head on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder, careful to tip his head far enough backwards that he wouldn&rsquo;t dig his Pooh ears into Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p><i>This is the best first date </i>ever<i>.</i></p><p>They had missed most of the fireworks just staring at each other and kissing, but they caught the grand finale. Phil periodically made small noises of wonder and amazement that Dan wished he could bottle up and keep forever.</p><p>Too soon, the fireworks ended. Phil turned to Dan with a tired, but happy, smile, which Dan returned.</p><p>They made their way back through the crowd and to the parking lot, still hand-in-hand. It was a bit of a long walk, given the number of people trying to leave and the crazy distance from the park to the parking lot, but they were content to walk it in silence. The silence was comfortable, like a warm hug or a soft kiss. Dan wished the moment never had to end.</p><p>They eventually made it to Dan&rsquo;s car. Dan held the door open for Phil and shut it behind him, then went to open his own door and sit down behind the wheel.</p><p>Phil let out a deep, happy sigh. &ldquo;That was really fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I had a really good time,&rdquo; Dan sighed happily as he started the car. He didn&rsquo;t move the car yet, though. Instead, he sat back in his seat and looked over at Phil with a small smile.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s hand crept forward and caught Dan&rsquo;s over the middle console, squeezing gently. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you missed some of the fireworks, though. That was kind of the whole reason we came,&rdquo; Dan said plainly, like he felt like it had to be said. He wasn&rsquo;t sorry at all, actually, as what made Phil miss the fireworks was infinitely better than the fireworks themselves. He was also fairly certain Phil wasn&rsquo;t too bothered by it, but he felt like it had to be said, anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, I&rsquo;m not. But, hey, that gives us something to do next time,&rdquo; Phil said casually, looking over at Dan, the ghost of a smile playing at his lips.</p><p>It took Dan&rsquo;s brain a moment to process Phil&rsquo;s words</p><p>&ldquo;Next time?&rdquo; he asked hopefully, a wide grin spreading across his face. <i>Please, this was amazing</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep. Maybe we&rsquo;ll go to Epcot to see those fireworks, instead.&rdquo; Phil smirked. &ldquo;Or maybe we&rsquo;ll miss those, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s heart skipped a bit and red flooded his cheeks.</p><p><i>Fuck. He wants to kiss me more? He wants to do this again. Oh my god.</i></p><p>Laughter outside the car jolted Dan out of his thoughts. A family walked past, and Dan watched them find their car. </p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better start driving home.&rdquo; </p><p>He put the car in gear and moved them towards the line of cars trying to leave the park. Phil started talking about his favorite funny moments of the day, and Dan chimed in with a few Phil missed. Phil also insisted that Dan tell him he was right about the Pooh hats. </p><p>&ldquo;They were the most important thing. They completed the whole picture. You&rsquo;re the one always going on and on about aesthetics! There&rsquo;s no way you think they weren&rsquo;t the best idea ever,&rdquo; Phil argued playfully. He had a smug grin on his face and he poked Dan&rsquo;s arm a few times to drive his point home.</p><p><i>God, he&rsquo;s cute. He </i>so<i> wants me to agree with him, but I can&rsquo;t give up that easily</i>, Dan thought mischievously. A smirk formed on his face as he started to rile Phil up about it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;Winnie the Pooh doesn&rsquo;t fit my aesthetic, especially not right now. Yellow ears with this pink and blue shirt? Major clashing goin&rsquo; on here. I definitely look ridiculous.&rdquo; Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Phil&rsquo;s jaw drop in mock outrage. Dan&rsquo;s smirk grew as his plan succeeded.</p><p>&ldquo;Winnie the Pooh fits <i>everyone&rsquo;s</i> aesthetic! There&rsquo;s never a wrong time to wear Pooh ears, and looking ridiculous is the best part of it! Plus, we looked so cute together that it had to have been worth it,&rdquo; Phil declared indignantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmm&hellip;&rdquo; Dan hummed thoughtfully. &ldquo;I suppose we were a little cute, maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil squawked. &ldquo;A <i>little</i>? Only a <i>little</i>? I&rsquo;ll have you know we were <i>definitely</i> the cutest people anyone saw at the Magic Kingdom <i>all day</i>,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Everyone was jealous of us.&rdquo; He crossed his arms with a huff, shooting Dan a sour glare. &ldquo;It was the <i>best</i> idea.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan finally couldn&rsquo;t hold back his laughter anymore, letting it out in a loud burst absolutely <i>drenched</i> in fondness. He reached a hand out and pried Phil&rsquo;s arms apart so he could hold Phil&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just messing with you, Phil! I loved the hats and the cute couple aesthetic and how jealous we made everyone else. They <i>were</i> the best idea.&rdquo; He chanced a glance over at Phil, who had finally relaxed back into his seat after tensely arguing his points. Dan sent him an affectionate smile. &ldquo;Thank you. They made my day. Well,&rdquo; he added after a beat, &ldquo;maybe not <i>quite</i>. The fireworks would be hard to beat.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil blushed heavily, biting his lip to hide a grin. &ldquo;Good. Great. The hats and the&hellip; <i>fireworks</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan pulled their clasped hands to his face and pressed a delicate kiss to the back of Phil&rsquo;s hand, delighting in the quiet giggle it tugged from Phil, then let go of Phil&rsquo;s hand to put his hand back on the steering wheel.</p><p>After a few minutes of companionable silence, they moved on to talking about their jobs and why they worked at Disney, describing the incomparable feeling of bringing the magical joy to everyone who visited. Somehow, these conversations led them all the way back to Phil&rsquo;s house. Dan wasn&rsquo;t sure where the time went, but he wished it would come back.</p><p>He pulled over in front of Phil&rsquo;s house and put the car in park, resting his hand on the middle console.</p><p><i>I really don&rsquo;t want this to end.</i></p><p>Apparently Phil didn&rsquo;t want it to end either, as he made no move to get up. He just sat, staring at his house for a moment, then he turned to Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;I really did have a great time,&rdquo; he said quietly, reaching out to play with Dan&rsquo;s fingers.</p><p>Dan smiled softly, meeting Phil&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he whispered fondly. He moved his hand slightly so it was holding Phil&rsquo;s, and he squeezed gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for treating me. It was sweet of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s cheeks flushed, and he looked down. &ldquo;You deserve to feel special,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p><p>Soft fingers brushed against Dan&rsquo;s jaw, carefully raising his face so he would look at Phil.</p><p><i>Phil&rsquo;s so beautiful. How did I even get here? </i></p><p>&ldquo;So do you,&rdquo; Phil whispered. &ldquo;So, if it&rsquo;s okay with you, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> take <i>you</i> out next time.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan nodded slowly. He was completely speechless with happiness. Phil had just confirmed that this would happen again, and Dan was thrilled and just a bit overwhelmed, especially with how Phil&rsquo;s hand caressed his cheek and how close Phil&rsquo;s face was to his. </p><p>And then Phil&rsquo;s face came even closer, and Dan&rsquo;s eyes closed as their lips touched.</p><p>It was a soft and sweet kiss, shorter than the ones earlier that night, and it left Dan wanting more as Phil pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; Phil whispered, his breath fanning across Dan&rsquo;s face. </p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; Dan replied softly, his eyes locked on Phil&rsquo;s. He wished the night didn&rsquo;t have to end, that he could spend more time with Phil, but he didn&rsquo;t push it. Maybe a different night, but not right now. The rest of their day had already been perfect, anyway.</p><p>Phil smiled, then turned and got out of the car, quickly walking up the walkway to his house.</p><p>Dan stared after him in a daze, reaching up and touching his lips with his fingers. He let out a lovestruck sigh, then smiled wide as he started to drive back home.</p><p>A memory came to him as he drove, and he smiled, then laughed.</p><p>He definitely didn&rsquo;t need to worry about some six-year-old coming and stealing his Phil away.</p>",
