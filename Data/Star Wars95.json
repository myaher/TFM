        "body": "<p>It\u2019s not as if I disliked \u201cRogue One\u201d. I found it\nexcellently made, from the political, philosophic, psychological point of view\nas well as with regard to settings, action scenes, acting, music, effects etc.</p><p>But why didn\u2019t anyone tell me how deeply sad this\nstory is?<br/></p><p>\u201cRogue One\u201d tells the story of a group of persons who\nall, for different reasons, have nothing left to lose and thus sacrifice their\nlives to help the Rebellion against Palpatine\u2019s Empire. There is no reason for\nus viewers to get attached to the members of this crazy suicide mission: it is\ntheir destiny to die and we can sense that right from the beginning. Personally,\nI never felt compelled to root for them, I only felt terribly sorry for them.<br/></p><p>It sure is interesting to be confronted with the reality\nthat so many heroes gave an important contribution to the end of the war but\nnever got anything good from it; also, how bleak and dangerous their lives in\nthis totalitarian Empire were, constantly on the run, always oppressed, losing\nanother piece of themselves over and over - family, health, mental sanity,\nsafety, integrity, in the end life.<br/></p><p>The only character I could feel with a little was\nCassian, who stayed by Jyn\u2019s side to the bitter end so she wouldn\u2019t have to die\nalone. Jyn on the other hand never requited his feelings; her entire being was\nset on doing her father\u2019s will, and Cassian, like everybody or everything else,\nwas just a meaning to this end for her. (Though, in all honesty, she never\ncompelled or manipulated anyone.) She may have been meant as a strong female\ncharacter, but I didn\u2019t find her in the least compelling or admirable. Jyn did\nwhat she had to do because she did not know what else to do with her life.<br/></p><p>Jyn\u2019s fate is a somewhat sarcastic take on the bond\nbetween child and father emphasizing that a father may give his child\u2019s life\ndirection and purpose but that this must not necessarily make him (or her, in\nthis case) happy.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"605\" data-orig-height=\"252\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e3682244315d166ec230804fb3e29f2/tumblr_inline_pn0qlfrE8T1woggaa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"605\" data-orig-height=\"252\"/></figure><p>What baffled me most, in retrospect, was the reaction coming\nfrom most Star Wars fans. Long before I had watched the film, I had heard respectively\nonly read of enthusiastic responses, usually culminating in \u201cA <i>real</i> Star Wars film again, at last!\u201d</p><p>Of course setting and design remind very much of \u201cA\nNew Hope\u201d, because the story is set shortly before; and for brief periods we\nsee the Death Star, Governor Tarkin, Leia and Darth Vader.<br/></p><p>So then, this is what fans want, this is allegedly\n\u201creal Star Wars\u201d? Excuse me, <i>depressing</i>?\nNot the aesthetics and the message of the Prequels, the energy and drive of the\nclassics or the new impulses and hopeful glimpses of the Sequels? Does it only\ndepend on cosmetics whether a film is defined \u201creal Star Wars\u201d or not?</p><p>This whole story is a tragedy. It\u2019s not a call to\nadventure with a happy ending like \u201cA New Hope\u201d or \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d, a\nGreek-style drama like \u201cReturn of the Sith\u201d or anything of the sort. It\u2019s\nsupposed to bring home that there is nothing wonderful about war and that\neveryone involved will lose much more than they win. This also fits to one of\nthe Sequels\u2019 themes, when we meet the old heroes again; they had won a war and\nfounded a family - but before that, Luke and Leia had lost their old families,\nLuke had to give up his dream of becoming a pilot, and all of them suffered\nthrough tremendous physical and psychical horrors. And, as we learn, after a\nperiod of peace they had to watch their victory go up in smoke again as the\nembodiment of their hopes, their son and heir, nephew and pupil, turned his\nback on them and devoted himself to becoming evil like his grandfather, the\nvery person they had fought against respectively tried to rescue and redeem all\nof these years before.<br/></p><p>Yes, in a way \u201cRogue One\u201d is \u201creal Star Wars\u201d. There\nis a person with father issues at the center, it\u2019s an authentic, honest story,\nthe characters are well-developed and the narrative is well thought out. But I\nwas left almost in tears thinking how the hope Leia expressed in the last scene\nwas founded on the absolute lack of hope of the protagonists of the crazy Death\nStar mission. I felt depressed for two days after.</p><p>Even \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d doesn\u2019t make me feel that\nbad when I watch it, though the outcome is so terrible. There is Padm\u00e9s funeral\nscene that leaves the viewer space to mourn, and the scenes with the twins and\ntheir surrogate families announcing that not all is lost. \u201cRogue One\u201d just\nmakes a quick cut when all is said and done and that\u2019s it.</p><p>No one will ever think about these persons ever again,\nno one will mourn them, no one will be grateful to them or call them heroes. A\nbrutally honest take on war and rebellion, opposite to the end of \u201cA New Hope\u201d\nwhere the heroes are celebrated and seen as such, though they are responsible\nfor the death of everybody who lived on the Death Star. (Not that I\u2019m blaming\nthem, in that situation it was either destroy them or be destroyed.)</p><p>Luke Skywalker, hero of the first classic film which\ndirectly follows after this one, never knew his parents, lost his foster\nparents and his mentor during the course of a few days, but he joined the\nRebellion and thrived on it. For Jyn, the loss of her family is a dead weight\nwhich hangs on her shoulders until it leads to her death. Jyn merely survives,\nmaking one heavy step after the other; she never rebels and goes her own way like Luke did.<br/></p><p>I was also surprised since I had heard that Jyn was\nsupposed to be a strong-willed woman, designed to be a role model to female\nspectators. I wouldn\u2019t want any girl to choose Jyn as a personal example to go\nby: she is a cold, cynical person whose life never knows fulfilment, not a\nsymbol of hope but of relinquishing of life, hope, happiness.<br/></p><p>Her characterization is particularly bitter when we\ncompare her to Han Solo, to whom Star War\u2019s second spin-off was dedicated two\nyears later. Though Han has a sarcastic streak, he remains generous and\nhumorous, and he always cares and is cared about by someone. Despite his name,\nhe is never really alone: he bonds with Qi\u2019Ra, Chewbacca, Lando and Enfys Nest,\nwhile Jyn never is close to anyone. (Is it a coincidence that the names \u201cHan\u201d\nand \u201cJyn\u201d are so alike, I wonder?)<br/></p><p>Also contrarily to Jyn, Han turns his back on his\nfather figure Beckett, deciding to go his own way. And in both cases, this\nattitude is not heroic in the conventional sense, but personal; Jyn does her\nfather\u2019s will because she feels committed to him, not to some greater cause.\nHan, too, rejects Beckett when he feels personally betrayed and let down by him. No wonder\nHan, as we get to know him in the classic films, is the most independent and worldly-wise\nof the characters.\u00a0He\ninitially had no father figure, then he found one but in the end, he chose to\ndo without him. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence, when Han kills Beckett in\nself-defense, that his last words are \u201cYou made a wise choice\u201d.</p><p>The difference between Han and Jyn, or also Luke,\nAnakin and Rey, to name other Star Wars heroes, is that he doesn\u2019t have a father\nfigure but he also doesn\u2019t look out for one. He gladly befriends Beckett who is\nmore experienced than he, but when he finds he can\u2019t trust him he turns his\nback on him, with regret but not mourning him for long.\n\n\n\n</p><figure data-orig-width=\"572\" data-orig-height=\"322\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d4fd0bac97be2f977fdfee1d5ad8dc7/tumblr_inline_pn0qmf8hIP1woggaa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"572\" data-orig-height=\"322\"/></figure><p>Han never knew where he came from,\nbut with that also came the freedom to make his own choices; and as we know,\ncontrarily to Jyn he still had a long and fulfilling life and found real\nfriends, a home and a purpose. Very fittingly, \u201cSolo - a Star Wars Story\u201d is a\nfeelgood film and not in the least depressing.</p><p>In both cases, we have a very realistic and not at all\nstarry-eyed outlook on what \u201cheroism\u201d and \u201cfighting for a just cause\u201d means.\nStar Wars remains true to itself by hammering home all over again that it is\nnot at all gratifying to be a lonely hero, and that on the other hand having a\nfamily may be a good thing, but being defined by them is a crushing burden. Picking\nup that burden and doing what you believe you have to do in order to feel\nconnected to them may lead to the desired end, but then the question arises\nwhether that end is really so desirable if the cost is so high. Again, Star\nWars is not about the good guys blowing up the bad guys, but about growing up.</p><p>Luke Skywalker never knew about his family for a very\nlong time, and after he had learned about it his father died, leaving it to him\nto repair the damage Vader had caused together with Palpatine; and as we see him\nagain in \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d his character shows a bitter parallel to Jyn - lonely\nand disillusioned. This also follows the line of the\nPrequels: even if you have the best intentions you may still err, and deciding to give your life to what you perceive as a higher cause may literally become your,\nnot exactly happy, fate. Becoming a Jedi master Luke became emotionally detached, which brought to the downfall of his temple; only when he\ncommunicated with someone again - Rey, Yoda, Leia, and also with his nephew a\nlittle - his existence gained new purpose.</p><p>In his last moments, Luke announces that he will still be\nthere as a Force spirit; and after death he is remembered by many people in the\ngalaxy, whether they knew him personally or not.<br/></p><p>Jyn and Cassian die in the blaze of the Death Star\nfire, giving up what little they still had or were; Luke\u2019s death is illuminated\nby the light of the twin suns which this time rise instead of setting. He loved\nand was loved, that is why he will never be truly gone. Jyn, Cassian and the\nother members of the Rogue One mission are forgotten, despite the invaluable\nservice they did to the galaxy at large. This is what \u201cRogue One\u201d ultimately is\nabout: complete, utter and inescapable loneliness.<br/></p><p>So, thank you for the food for thought, \u201cRogue One\u201d. But\nI don\u2019t think I will watch you ever again.<br/></p>",

Jyn on the other hand never requited his feelings; her entire being was\nset on doing her father\u2019s will, and Cassian, like everybody or everything else,\nwas just a meaning to this end for her. (Though, in all honesty, she never\ncompelled or manipulated anyone.) She may have been meant as a strong female\ncharacter, but I didn\u2019t find her in the least compelling or admirable. Jyn did\nwhat she had to do because she did not know what else to do with her life.<br></p><p>Jyn\u2019s fate is a somewhat sarcastic take on the bond\nbetween child and father emphasizing that a father may give his child\u2019s life\ndirection and purpose but that this must not necessarily make him (or her, in\nthis case) happy.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"605\" data-orig-height=\"252\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e3682244315d166ec230804fb3e29f2/tumblr_inline_pn0qlfrE8T1woggaa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"605\" data-orig-height=\"252\"></figure><p>What baffled me most, in retrospect, was the reaction coming\nfrom most Star Wars fans.

It\u2019s\nsupposed to bring home that there is nothing wonderful about war and that\neveryone involved will lose much more than they win. This also fits to one of\nthe Sequels\u2019 themes, when we meet the old heroes again; they had won a war and\nfounded a family - but before that, Luke and Leia had lost their old families,\nLuke had to give up his dream of becoming a pilot, and all of them suffered\nthrough tremendous physical and psychical horrors. And, as we learn, after a\nperiod of peace they had to watch their victory go up in smoke again as the\nembodiment of their hopes, their son and heir, nephew and pupil, turned his\nback on them and devoted himself to becoming evil like his grandfather, the\nvery person they had fought against respectively tried to rescue and redeem all\nof these years before.<br></p><p>Yes, in a way \u201cRogue One\u201d is \u201creal Star Wars\u201d. There\nis a person with father issues at the center, it\u2019s an authentic, honest story,\nthe characters are well-developed and the narrative is well thought out. But I\nwas left almost in tears thinking how the hope Leia expressed in the last scene\nwas founded on the absolute lack of hope of the protagonists of the crazy Death\nStar mission. I felt depressed for two days after.</p><p>Even \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d doesn\u2019t make me feel that\nbad when I watch it, though the outcome is so terrible.

                "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s not as if I disliked &ldquo;Rogue One&rdquo;. I found it\nexcellently made, from the political, philosophic, psychological point of view\nas well as with regard to settings, action scenes, acting, music, effects etc.</p><p>But why didn&rsquo;t anyone tell me how deeply sad this\nstory is?<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Rogue One&rdquo; tells the story of a group of persons who\nall, for different reasons, have nothing left to lose and thus sacrifice their\nlives to help the Rebellion against Palpatine&rsquo;s Empire. There is no reason for\nus viewers to get attached to the members of this crazy suicide mission: it is\ntheir destiny to die and we can sense that right from the beginning. Personally,\nI never felt compelled to root for them, I only felt terribly sorry for them.<br /></p><p>It sure is interesting to be confronted with the reality\nthat so many heroes gave an important contribution to the end of the war but\nnever got anything good from it; also, how bleak and dangerous their lives in\nthis totalitarian Empire were, constantly on the run, always oppressed, losing\nanother piece of themselves over and over - family, health, mental sanity,\nsafety, integrity, in the end life.<br /></p><p>The only character I could feel with a little was\nCassian, who stayed by Jyn&rsquo;s side to the bitter end so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to die\nalone. Jyn on the other hand never requited his feelings; her entire being was\nset on doing her father&rsquo;s will, and Cassian, like everybody or everything else,\nwas just a meaning to this end for her. (Though, in all honesty, she never\ncompelled or manipulated anyone.) She may have been meant as a strong female\ncharacter, but I didn&rsquo;t find her in the least compelling or admirable. Jyn did\nwhat she had to do because she did not know what else to do with her life.<br /></p><p>Jyn&rsquo;s fate is a somewhat sarcastic take on the bond\nbetween child and father emphasizing that a father may give his child&rsquo;s life\ndirection and purpose but that this must not necessarily make him (or her, in\nthis case) happy.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e3682244315d166ec230804fb3e29f2/tumblr_inline_pn0qlfrE8T1woggaa_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>What baffled me most, in retrospect, was the reaction coming\nfrom most Star Wars fans. Long before I had watched the film, I had heard respectively\nonly read of enthusiastic responses, usually culminating in &ldquo;A <i>real</i> Star Wars film again, at last!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course setting and design remind very much of &ldquo;A\nNew Hope&rdquo;, because the story is set shortly before; and for brief periods we\nsee the Death Star, Governor Tarkin, Leia and Darth Vader.<br /></p><p>So then, this is what fans want, this is allegedly\n&ldquo;real Star Wars&rdquo;? Excuse me, <i>depressing</i>?\nNot the aesthetics and the message of the Prequels, the energy and drive of the\nclassics or the new impulses and hopeful glimpses of the Sequels? Does it only\ndepend on cosmetics whether a film is defined &ldquo;real Star Wars&rdquo; or not?</p><p>This whole story is a tragedy. It&rsquo;s not a call to\nadventure with a happy ending like &ldquo;A New Hope&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Phantom Menace&rdquo;, a\nGreek-style drama like &ldquo;Return of the Sith&rdquo; or anything of the sort. It&rsquo;s\nsupposed to bring home that there is nothing wonderful about war and that\neveryone involved will lose much more than they win. This also fits to one of\nthe Sequels&rsquo; themes, when we meet the old heroes again; they had won a war and\nfounded a family - but before that, Luke and Leia had lost their old families,\nLuke had to give up his dream of becoming a pilot, and all of them suffered\nthrough tremendous physical and psychical horrors. And, as we learn, after a\nperiod of peace they had to watch their victory go up in smoke again as the\nembodiment of their hopes, their son and heir, nephew and pupil, turned his\nback on them and devoted himself to becoming evil like his grandfather, the\nvery person they had fought against respectively tried to rescue and redeem all\nof these years before.<br /></p><p>Yes, in a way &ldquo;Rogue One&rdquo; is &ldquo;real Star Wars&rdquo;. There\nis a person with father issues at the center, it&rsquo;s an authentic, honest story,\nthe characters are well-developed and the narrative is well thought out. But I\nwas left almost in tears thinking how the hope Leia expressed in the last scene\nwas founded on the absolute lack of hope of the protagonists of the crazy Death\nStar mission. I felt depressed for two days after.</p><p>Even &ldquo;Revenge of the Sith&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make me feel that\nbad when I watch it, though the outcome is so terrible. There is Padm&eacute;s funeral\nscene that leaves the viewer space to mourn, and the scenes with the twins and\ntheir surrogate families announcing that not all is lost. &ldquo;Rogue One&rdquo; just\nmakes a quick cut when all is said and done and that&rsquo;s it.</p><p>No one will ever think about these persons ever again,\nno one will mourn them, no one will be grateful to them or call them heroes. A\nbrutally honest take on war and rebellion, opposite to the end of &ldquo;A New Hope&rdquo;\nwhere the heroes are celebrated and seen as such, though they are responsible\nfor the death of everybody who lived on the Death Star. (Not that I&rsquo;m blaming\nthem, in that situation it was either destroy them or be destroyed.)</p><p>Luke Skywalker, hero of the first classic film which\ndirectly follows after this one, never knew his parents, lost his foster\nparents and his mentor during the course of a few days, but he joined the\nRebellion and thrived on it. For Jyn, the loss of her family is a dead weight\nwhich hangs on her shoulders until it leads to her death. Jyn merely survives,\nmaking one heavy step after the other; she never rebels and goes her own way like Luke did.<br /></p><p>I was also surprised since I had heard that Jyn was\nsupposed to be a strong-willed woman, designed to be a role model to female\nspectators. I wouldn&rsquo;t want any girl to choose Jyn as a personal example to go\nby: she is a cold, cynical person whose life never knows fulfilment, not a\nsymbol of hope but of relinquishing of life, hope, happiness.<br /></p><p>Her characterization is particularly bitter when we\ncompare her to Han Solo, to whom Star War&rsquo;s second spin-off was dedicated two\nyears later. Though Han has a sarcastic streak, he remains generous and\nhumorous, and he always cares and is cared about by someone.
