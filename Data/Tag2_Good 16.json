It rurned our to be an awful lot longer than I was planning it to be, but goddamn, it was so much fun to write! I apologise for any typos or slight inconsistencies, it\u2019s currently half past 12am where I live but I really want to get this done heheheh so, enjoy!</i></p><p>The relentless pattering of rain on commuters\u2019 umbrellas is all that surrounds you. Footsteps falling harshly and splashing loudly in puddles on the pavement is just adding to the already cacophonous and gloomy Monday morning. </p><p>And yet, you\u2019re smiling as you weave your way through the wet streets with quiet determination, down the path you know so well and take every couple of days. Who are you kidding, on most days.</p><p>Clinging onto your umbrella, you stop at a set of traffic lights, adjusting the strap of your backpack slightly with your other hand as you\u2019re now, the only thing standing between you and the bookshop, is a road.</p><p>You think back at the first time you stumbled upon this little shop. Seems like forever ago, really, when it has only been a few months in reality.</p><p>It has a simple shop front with a charming sign above it reading \u2018A. Z. Fell and Co.\u2019. But as you stepped inside was when it really came to be the place you loved. Wall to wall shelves that are just covered in hundreds, maybe even thousands of books. Mostly first editions of anything you could think of, most signed, some even hand written. With dog eared pages as worn out leather covers, you couldn\u2019t help but smile as you breathed in the air of the cozy shop. </p><p>When you were greeted by gentle shop keeper, that\u2019s when your world turned. He seemed to literally light up the room. It almost felt as if he was the source of the coziness of the whole shop, as you couldn\u2019t help but blush as his grey orbs met yours and he gently extended a hand introducing himself. \u201cCan I help with anything?\u201d He asked softly and you could have been knocked over by a feather as the softly spoken words have floated out of his mouth. </p><p>You quickly muttered that you\u2019ll be fine and grabbed a random book of the self closest to you, hurriedly sitting in the furthest possible corner.</p><p>Your next visit was only a few days later.
