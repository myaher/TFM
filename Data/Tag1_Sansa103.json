She thought the print of this Sansa s7 dress&ndash;the one some say looks like the Bolton sigil&ndash;looked like swimming fishes, after all.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/457dcc0b136d8e9f91e3a5e886e016e5/tumblr_inline_poj7lwM2W11upc2qw_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be so damn literal.</p><hr /><p>Like anon #1, <b>this new dress gives me&nbsp;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch me&rdquo; vibes</b>, the way it covers her from neck to ankle with long narrow sleeves + the belt. The silhouette is just like her s7 dresses too (sans the shoulder things). <b>And yet the texture makes it look brittle and broken, as if the armor has already started to crack and is ready to fall off.</b></p><p>And when she&rsquo;ll wear this&hellip; Hibberd (GoT&rsquo;s Entertainment Weekly person) called this Sansa&rsquo;s battle dress, iirc. So I assume she&rsquo;ll wear it on the night of the battle. Unless he means a different kind of battle. <b>Perhaps this is her &ldquo;the gloves are off&rdquo; dress</b>, one she&rsquo;ll wear to show that she means business and can&rsquo;t be bossed around in her own home.</p><p>Either way, <b>I don&rsquo;t think Jon and Sansa will have a physically intimate scene in the broken tower to echo Jaime and Cersei</b> in s08e01. I have a hard time seeing them being intimate before a wedding (both because they&rsquo;re J/C foils and because I doubt Jon would want to dishonor Sansa that way), and so I think Sansa&rsquo;s belt and armor won&rsquo;t come off properly until the wedding night (or later still, if their wedding night is interrupted).</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know, anons. I&rsquo;m basically just rambling, thinking out loud. This dress still perplexes me. As much as it looks like charcoal to me, it can still be dragon scales or fish scales or feathers or dragonglass or something else entirely. I really don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Thanks for the asks!</p></p>",

So I was like easy, I can do that.</p><p>My thoughts:<br/>Arya is my favourite without a doubt. She\u2019s clever and I so want her to be a swordswoman. And now she\u2019s heading to the wall?! So much potential.\u00a0</p><p>I really like Sansa too- at first I thought she\u2019d annoy me because she wouldn\u2019t understand the game but she does- oh, she does understand the game, and she is terrified and clever. I love how now she knows who Joffrey is, but she is clever.\u00a0</p><p>Also, fuck Joffrey.</p><p>I love all the Starks to be honest, though Mama Stark the least. I don\u2019t know what but something about Catelyn just makes me go hmm.</p><p>I know that GoT has a rep for killing everyone but I gasped when Ned Stark was killed! Wow, when he wanted to see Arya one last time and she wasn\u2019t there? Good. His whole arc was really, really good. His loyalty and honour, and assumption that the Lannisters would play the game on his terms, screwed everything over royally and it was great.\u00a0</p><p>And I was so happy when Daenarys\u2019 brother was killed. What a prick.\u00a0</p><p>So, Daenarys- I like her, don\u2019t love her. She\u2019ll do something badass like eat the heart or claim the slaves as her people or stand up as Khalessi and I\u2019ll be like yes!! But she also does other stuff like try dark magic to save her husband?? Obviously the price would be your son?? Whatever, stupidity is allowed, dark magic is always the wrong call. Also, Drogo was like, a literal rapist in every sense so I really was not rooting for him to live. Not a fan of the Dothraki people in general to be honest. It also seems like a really shady call on the side of the Targaryans to be like- I\u2019m going to marry into this people because they have an army which is good logic, but they will not cross an ocean to reach the land we are trying to reclaim? And their succession isn\u2019t through the bloodline, it\u2019s whoever\u2019s the most powerful warrior at the time? If the Khal you chose were to drop dead, you\u2019re screwed and you\u2019ve lost everything. Which is exactly what happened. I love that she is the Dragon through and she\u2019s fire-proof and has some dragons!!<br/>I\u2019ve seen a lot of people saying that GoT is like torture porn and I get it because Hollywood sucks right, but they haven\u2019t shown any graphic rape, and all the guys that fit that description- Daenarys\u2019 brother, Drogo etc are dead. So I don\u2019t think the narrative is too much on the rapey side, though I\u2019m not a fan of the cavalier nature prostitution is treated, and how it hasn\u2019t really been addressed that that is awful, you know? I\u2019m waiting on that point. Also, the nudity- awkward and unnecessary but that\u2019s the angle the show is aimed at, it\u2019s the point so fine whatever. Even though the ratio was massively off, I was pleased it wasn\u2019t just women, because in a 15 movie a woman will be naked and a man will be shirtless because that\u2019s the same? So even though it was skewed I\u2019m glad it did at least a little go both ways.\u00a0</p><p>So, Cersei. Damn she\u2019s clever. If it wasn\u2019t for the whole, you know, incest thing, I\u2019d like her. Just, ew. God. It\u2019s awful. I know that\u2019s the point but god. She is gonna screw everyone over, though. Be afraid.\u00a0</p><p>Also, why does Cersei want Joffrey to marry Sansa? Like in the beginning, she wants a leash on that Starks, that makes sense, whatever. But now that the Starks are rebels, why does she care about Sansa? Why this girl specifically? I know they\u2019re keeping her for ransom but they wouldn\u2019t have to be planning to marry her off to the king they could just keep her somewhere. I really hope that\u2019s addressed.\u00a0</p><p>I will say that all the characters are generally very well written and so interesting.\u00a0</p><p>Also, the show majorly overestimates my ability to remember names and noble families. I suppose that they\u2019re trying to avoid exposition dumps and everything is written in such a way that I can follow everything, but yeah. It\u2019s just a lot at times when I\u2019m like, who are you? Particularly because I am the absolute worst at faces.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t care too much about Jon Snow at the moment because I feel like his plot will become relevant in a few seasons when whatever\u2019s outside the wall comes to play so for now, while he\u2019s stuck on the Night\u2019s Watch, there\u2019s not a hell of a lot he can do. His friends are cool though.\u00a0</p><p>I have this crack theory about Jon Snow that he\u2019s actually one of the King\u2019s bastards and will make a play for the throne. Because literally all of Ned\u2019s character is about honour but he cheated on his wife?? And it wasn\u2019t addressed or explained? Robert didn\u2019t seem like he was in on the secret so maybe Ned felt bad for Jon\u2019s mother and promised to take the boy in? And if it was known that he was the King\u2019s bastard being raised in a Lord\u2019s hosuehold that would defo raise some eyebrows so he kept it to himself? Though if that was the truth Catelyn would know so&hellip; idk.\u00a0</p><p>Next: Tyrion. He is&hellip; interesting. He is kind in some ways to Bran, and just seems to float along and serve himself and he is determined to be clever, useful and prove his worth? I don\u2019t love what he\u2019s like with prostitutes. Just- he\u2019s a lot but that is good. He\u2019ll probably have a bigger role now that Ned Stark is dead.\u00a0</p><p>Just- the season was well-written and interesting, and I\u2019m excited for season 2. Lots of pieces are in interesting positions.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s so hard trying to avoid spoilers, I always want to look up actor\u2019s names but I\u2019m scared on seeing on their page how long they were on the show for lol. Because I have not been spoiled, I do not know anything about who is alive or dead or what the hell is happening in the current season.\u00a0</p><p>On it goes!</p>",

But now that the Starks are rebels, why does she care about Sansa? Why this girl specifically? I know they\u2019re keeping her for ransom but they wouldn\u2019t have to be planning to marry her off to the king they could just keep her somewhere. I really hope that\u2019s addressed.\u00a0</p><p>I will say that all the characters are generally very well written and so interesting.\u00a0</p><p>Also, the show majorly overestimates my ability to remember names and noble families. I suppose that they\u2019re trying to avoid exposition dumps and everything is written in such a way that I can follow everything, but yeah. It\u2019s just a lot at times when I\u2019m like, who are you? Particularly because I am the absolute worst at faces.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t care too much about Jon Snow at the moment because I feel like his plot will become relevant in a few seasons when whatever\u2019s outside the wall comes to play so for now, while he\u2019s stuck on the Night\u2019s Watch, there\u2019s not a hell of a lot he can do. His friends are cool though.\u00a0</p><p>I have this crack theory about Jon Snow that he\u2019s actually one of the King\u2019s bastards and will make a play for the throne. Because literally all of Ned\u2019s character is about honour but he cheated on his wife?? And it wasn\u2019t addressed or explained? Robert didn\u2019t seem like he was in on the secret so maybe Ned felt bad for Jon\u2019s mother and promised to take the boy in? And if it was known that he was the King\u2019s bastard being raised in a Lord\u2019s hosuehold that would defo raise some eyebrows so he kept it to himself? Though if that was the truth Catelyn would know so\u2026 idk.\u00a0</p><p>Next: Tyrion. He is\u2026 interesting. He is kind in some ways to Bran, and just seems to float along and serve himself and he is determined to be clever, useful and prove his worth? I don\u2019t love what he\u2019s like with prostitutes. Just- he\u2019s a lot but that is good. He\u2019ll probably have a bigger role now that Ned Stark is dead.\u00a0</p><p>Just- the season was well-written and interesting, and I\u2019m excited for season 2. Lots of pieces are in interesting positions.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s so hard trying to avoid spoilers, I always want to look up actor\u2019s names but I\u2019m scared on seeing on their page how long they were on the show for lol. Because I have not been spoiled, I do not know anything about who is alive or dead or what the hell is happening in the current season.\u00a0</p><p>On it goes!</p>",
                "content": "<p>MAJOR SPOILERS TO GO</p><p>So, for reasons, I was like fine, yup now is the time I&rsquo;ll see on IMDb how many episodes and stuff there are. THERE&rsquo;S ONLY TEN?! So I was like easy, I can do that.</p><p>My thoughts:<br />Arya is my favourite without a doubt. She&rsquo;s clever and I so want her to be a swordswoman. And now she&rsquo;s heading to the wall?! So much potential.&nbsp;</p><p>I really like Sansa too- at first I thought she&rsquo;d annoy me because she wouldn&rsquo;t understand the game but she does- oh, she does understand the game, and she is terrified and clever. I love how now she knows who Joffrey is, but she is clever.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, fuck Joffrey.</p><p>I love all the Starks to be honest, though Mama Stark the least. I don&rsquo;t know what but something about Catelyn just makes me go hmm.</p><p>I know that GoT has a rep for killing everyone but I gasped when Ned Stark was killed! Wow, when he wanted to see Arya one last time and she wasn&rsquo;t there? Good. His whole arc was really, really good. His loyalty and honour, and assumption that the Lannisters would play the game on his terms, screwed everything over royally and it was great.&nbsp;</p><p>And I was so happy when Daenarys&rsquo; brother was killed. What a prick.&nbsp;</p><p>So, Daenarys- I like her, don&rsquo;t love her. She&rsquo;ll do something badass like eat the heart or claim the slaves as her people or stand up as Khalessi and I&rsquo;ll be like yes!! But she also does other stuff like try dark magic to save her husband?? Obviously the price would be your son?? Whatever, stupidity is allowed, dark magic is always the wrong call. Also, Drogo was like, a literal rapist in every sense so I really was not rooting for him to live. Not a fan of the Dothraki people in general to be honest. It also seems like a really shady call on the side of the Targaryans to be like- I&rsquo;m going to marry into this people because they have an army which is good logic, but they will not cross an ocean to reach the land we are trying to reclaim? And their succession isn&rsquo;t through the bloodline, it&rsquo;s whoever&rsquo;s the most powerful warrior at the time? If the Khal you chose were to drop dead, you&rsquo;re screwed and you&rsquo;ve lost everything. Which is exactly what happened. I love that she is the Dragon through and she&rsquo;s fire-proof and has some dragons!!<br />I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people saying that GoT is like torture porn and I get it because Hollywood sucks right, but they haven&rsquo;t shown any graphic rape, and all the guys that fit that description- Daenarys&rsquo; brother, Drogo etc are dead. So I don&rsquo;t think the narrative is too much on the rapey side, though I&rsquo;m not a fan of the cavalier nature prostitution is treated, and how it hasn&rsquo;t really been addressed that that is awful, you know? I&rsquo;m waiting on that point. Also, the nudity- awkward and unnecessary but that&rsquo;s the angle the show is aimed at, it&rsquo;s the point so fine whatever. Even though the ratio was massively off, I was pleased it wasn&rsquo;t just women, because in a 15 movie a woman will be naked and a man will be shirtless because that&rsquo;s the same? So even though it was skewed I&rsquo;m glad it did at least a little go both ways.&nbsp;</p><p>So, Cersei. Damn she&rsquo;s clever. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the whole, you know, incest thing, I&rsquo;d like her. Just, ew. God. It&rsquo;s awful. I know that&rsquo;s the point but god. She is gonna screw everyone over, though. Be afraid.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, why does Cersei want Joffrey to marry Sansa? Like in the beginning, she wants a leash on that Starks, that makes sense, whatever.

But as\nthey grew older, one by one they would begin to roll their eyes and maybe even\nleave the room to go riding or pursue some other worthwhile task like training\nat swords or sewing. But Bran never left; he always listened to the tale in\nfull. The scary ones were his favorite. &ldquo;Keep going, Nan,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say.</p><p>&ldquo;All right, little\nlord,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d comply with the continued click of her knitting needles.</p><p>&ldquo;It began with the\nChildren of the Forest. They had dwelled in the deep woods for untold ages,\nliving off the land and carving faces into their weirwood trees. The Children\nmade peace with the First Men&hellip;at first. But they were all of them deceived.</p><p>&ldquo;For the men\nbuilt&nbsp;permanent settlements and brought with them bronze weapons, great\nleathern shields, the first horses,&nbsp;and their own gods. And they cut down\nthe Children&rsquo;s trees.</p><p>&ldquo;One by one the forests\nwere felled for the sake of cities and fires, and the war began. The Children\nwere outnumbered and losing strength with the loss of their magic and their\ntrees.</p><p>&ldquo;But there were some who\nresisted. They needed a weapon. A pack of Children found one of these men\nlingering in their forest and captured him. Leaf, the leader of the pack,\nplunged her obsidian dagger into the man&rsquo;s heart and witnessed as his eyes\nturned blue and his skin transformed from flesh to ice. In that moment, the\nfirst White Walker was formed, the Night King, who would lead the army of the\ndead and bring about the Long Night.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This would be\na&nbsp;winter worse than all the rest. A winter when the snows fall a hundred\nfeet deep, when the sun hides for years, and children are born and live and\ndie, all in darkness. That is when the White Walkers move through the woods. Kings\nfroze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts, and women\nsmothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt their\ntears freeze on their cheeks. The White Walkers swept through cities and\nkingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders\nbig as hounds&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s\nenough,&rdquo; Robb would usually interrupt.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bran would\nprotest. &ldquo;Robb&mdash;Nan&mdash;please I want to hear the rest!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And wake up from\nnightmares about the Others in the middle of the night like I used to about the\nblue-eyed giant Mecumba? I think not,&rdquo; Robb would reason with a good-natured\nlaugh. &ldquo;The White Walkers aren&rsquo;t real, Bran. There is no Night King coming for\nus.&rdquo;</p><p>But Robb was wrong;\nwinter was coming and the dead with it. Not that Robb had lived long enough to\nsee it. He&rsquo;d died in the Twins with their mother when word of the return of the\nNight King and the Long Night were yet naught but whispers in the dark.</p>",

The heater filled the cold room with warmth, but she draped an extra fleece blanket over her legs. On the table next to her stood a big mug filled with damping hot tea. The mug stood next to the newest novel she had bought a few days ago, even though she had promised her mother to read all the books she already owned first.</p><p>The rain ticking against the window was nothing but background music. The howling wind circling around the house to attempt to rip the tiles off the roof simply added to the spooky atmosphere. It was the perfect day to just stay in and read, to get lost in a story and to only find her way back to the real world after she had read it all. </p><p>But she had barely read three pages when the doorbell echoed through the empty house. For a brief second she contemplated simply not opening, but then the doorbell rang again. </p><p>Longer this time. And much louder too. </p><p>With a soft moan Sansa stood up from her chair and she shivered when her bare feet touched the ice cold floor.

The heater filled the cold room with warmth, but she draped an extra fleece blanket over her legs. On the table next to her stood a big mug filled with damping hot tea. The mug stood next to the newest novel she had bought a few days ago, even though she had promised her mother to read all the books she already owned first.</p><p>The rain ticking against the window was nothing but background music.

And much louder too. </p><p>With a soft moan Sansa stood up from her chair and she shivered when her bare feet touched the ice cold floor. On the tips of her toes she rushed towards the front door and she opened it only slightly, determined to simply send the intruder away as soon as she could.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s dark black curls were glued to his forehead and the contours of his muscles were clearly visible through his soaked white shirt. He had his arms wrapped around him, but his teeth were clattering and his entire body shook visibly. &ldquo;Thank goodness you&rsquo;re home.&rdquo; He let out a relieved sigh. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t really looking forward to walking another three miles like this.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa thought about her book, waiting for her to be read, but then she opened the front door a little wider so Jon could step inside. &ldquo;What were you even doing out there? They&rsquo;ve warned countless of times that a huge storm was coming and that we shouldn&rsquo;t leave our homes, unless in the case of an emergency.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Jon nodded. On the floor around him a small puddle was forming. His hair was dripping and drops of water rolled down his skin. &ldquo;But I really had to get my book back to the library.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa widened her eyes and dropped her jaw while she crossed her arms over her chest. &ldquo;A book? You&rsquo;re risking your life over a library fine?&rdquo; She rolled her eyes and then she opened the door to the bathroom to get Jon a large and clean towel. &ldquo;The wind could have blown who knows what in your face or on top of you! They&rsquo;d really understand if you&rsquo;d be bringing in this book a few days late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought the weather forecast was exaggerating.&rdquo; Jon shrugged and took the towel from her. He buried his face in the soft fabric and dried himself as much as possible. &ldquo;Can I borrow your dryer for a minute?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t even wait for her answer and pulled his shirt over his head. </p><p>Sansa knew it was impolite to stare, but she had to stare anyway. Her eyes followed the sharp lines of his muscles and she fought the urge to place her hand on his naked chest to touch his gleaming skin. &ldquo;Yes, sure, of course&hellip;&rdquo; She stuttered and she swallowed when Jon took off his jeans too. </p><p>He was standing in her hallway wearing nothing but a black boxer short and instead of taking his wet clothes from him and putting them in the dryer, Sansa just stood there, unable to move. </p><p>She was not sure why she was speechless and why she stood frozen to the floor. She knew Jon ever since she had been a little girl. And just like every little girl she had had a small crush on her big brother&rsquo;s best friend. But she had thought that that crush had subsided, that her heart had calmed down, that Jon was nothing but an amazing friend. It seemed she had been hopelessly wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Jon walked a little closer towards her and he pressed the palms of his hands to her cheeks. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; He cocked his head and Sansa swallowed. He was not making things better now. Actually, he was mostly making things worse.</p><p>Her heart was now racing in her chest and she felt the adrenaline rushing through her veins. Every cell in her body and every sensitive part of her skin was reacting. &ldquo;Yes, yes&hellip;&rdquo; She tripped over her words once more and she wished for a hole in the ground that would swallow her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; She let her eyes wander of his body once more and she stuck the tip of her tongue between her slightly parted lips. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve surprised me a little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I surprised you?&rdquo; Jon raised his eyebrows, but a smirk appeared on his face. &ldquo;In a good or in a bad way?&rdquo; He kept his hands firmly on her cheeks and he leaned in slightly so Sansa could feel his warm breath on her nose. </p><p>She swallowed. &ldquo;That depends on what will happen next.&rdquo; Her voice was nothing but a soft whisper and a little reluctantly she placed her hands on his shoulders.
