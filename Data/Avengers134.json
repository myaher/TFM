The stories are automatically posted here from the AO3 RSS feed using an IFTTT recipe, but this was made easy thanks to astolat (astolat.tumblr.com). If you would like to set up a similar blog, see the instructions tab :) To check announcements regarding these blogs, go to the tumblr tag #ao3feed announcement. (moderated by enjolbutt.tumblr.com) I hope this blog helps when you are in dire need of feels or a laugh, so enjoy! :)",

Steve literally thought you merely had to book a venue, get a\ncake and do the ceremony. Maybe get a pizza afterwards. He had never considered\nthe flowers and tablecloths and the type of envelope to use for their\ninvitations. Tony on the other hand had made list after list about all the\nthings they needed to organise. And they had already agreed on doing a small\nwedding. The last thing Steve wanted was to get up in front of a crowd of\npeople he didn\u2019t really know and to make a spectacle of himself. He just wanted\nto marry the man he loved in front of the people he loved. But big or small,\nSteve wasn\u2019t able to escape the tablecloths.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care about tablecloths?\u201d Steve asked suddenly.\nHe heard Tony sigh and look up from his tablet, he was working on something. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked, he wasn\u2019t really listening so Steve\ndidn\u2019t bother repeating it. After a minute or two, Tony turned the tablet off\nand made a point of giving Steve his full attention.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the tablecloths <i>so</i>\nimportant?\u201d Steve asked and Tony gave Steve a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cthey\u2019re not.\u201d He said simply, which only irritated Steve.</p><p>\u201cThen why have I spent the past hour looking at and feeling\ndifferent tablecloths?\u201d Steve demanded and Tony chuckled. Steve didn\u2019t see what\nwas so funny. He couldn\u2019t get passed the fact that Tony didn\u2019t even think that\nthe tablecloths were an important part of their wedding.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest with you Steve, I don\u2019t give two flying shits\nabout the tablecloths,\u201d Tony ran a hand through his hair and Steve let out a\nfrustrated groan. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s adorable that you care so much.\u201d Tony\nsmirked.</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve\nwhined and Tony laughed.</p><p>\u201cthe tablecloths are important because they\u2019re a part of our\nwedding. I want everything to be perfect.\u201d Tony kissed Steve and Steve melted\ninto the kiss. This was perfect. Tablecloths and flowers and seating plans were\nirrelevant. The only perfect wedding would be one where Steve was marrying\nTony. Nothing else mattered. </p><p>\u201cWell since the tablecloths aren\u2019t so important,\u201d Steve\npulled away from the kiss and they were grinning like the biggest dorks in the\nworld. \u201cYou can decide which one we use.\u201d Steve smirked and Tony frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhich was your favourite?\u201d Tony asked and Steve shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhichever one you pick.\u201d Steve stood up from the couch and\nstretched, he considered going for a run. But then there was banging on their\nfront door. Steve and Tony shared a look and Steve went to go answer it. He\ntripped on at least five of Peter\u2019s toys and made a mental note to clean up\nafter he dealt with whoever was at the door. But when Steve swung the door\nopen, he saw one of the most terrifying things of his life. </p><p>Natasha was crying. </p><p>\u201cNat?\u201d Steve asked with wide eyes and she flung herself at\nhim. She wrapped her arms tightly around his body and began crying into Steve\u2019s\nchest. Steve slowly wrapped his arms around her and looked over at Tony, who\nlooked just as confused as Steve was.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tony asked and she only cried harder.</p><p>\u201cNat you need to calm down. It\u2019s going to be alright. What\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d Steve asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI screwed up Steve, I made a <i>huge</i> mistake.\u201d She pulled away from Steve and began to pace around\nthe apartment.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Steve asked. She merely glared at one of\nPeter\u2019s toys that she had stepped on. She was clearly frustrated with herself\nand seemed to be moving from all out panic to anger.</p><p>\u201cyou have to promise not to tell anyone!\u201d She pleaded and\nSteve nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony murmured softly, clearly just as worried as\nSteve was about her. Nat was usually level headed, the calm one out of all the\nAvengers.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI slept with Clint.\u201d Well, shit.\n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Tony had not expected Nat to say that. He had thought she\u2019d\nkilled someone, or been found by some Hydra agents, something other than what\nshe had actually done. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you slept with Clint?\u201d Tony asked,\nbreaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cWell, I went to his house to talk to him and he had just\nhad a massive fight with Laura.\u201d She was pacing again and Tony felt his stomach\ntwisting and churning. </p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Tony coaxed and she sighed, finally sitting down\non their crappy couch. Tony did not miss the days when he used to sleep on that\ncouch.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I was comforting him and he\u2019d said she\u2019d ended it.\nSo we started drinking and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo you were both drunk?\u201d Steve asked, that could be fixed.\nShe could easily peg it as a drunken mistake, she didn\u2019t need to be freaking\nout.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was slightly tipsy.\u201d Usually she had her guard up,\nbut Clint always managed to walk past any walls that Natasha managed to put up.</p><p>\u201cAnd Clint?\u201d She put her head in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI think he was sober, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She was crying again. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Nat, this isn\u2019t the end of the\nworld.\u201d Tony sat down on the horrid couch and put an arm around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve <i>never</i> done\nsomething so stupid before.\u201d Tony believed her. He couldn\u2019t imagine Natasha\nmaking irrational decisions. </p><p>\u201cWe know.\u201d Steve sat down on the other side of Nat, they sat\nin silence for a long time.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter?\u201d Nat asked suddenly, Tony was relieved he\nwasn\u2019t here right now. He didn\u2019t want Peter to see Nat like this. So scared.</p><p>\u201cNext door.\u201d Steve answered.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Clint say, afterwards?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and\nshe put her head in her hands. </p><p>\u201cHe said we\u2019d talk later.\u201d She muttered and Tony frowned. It\nwasn\u2019t necessarily bad or good. It was neutral.</p><p>\u201cWell at least he didn\u2019t say it was a mistake.\u201d Steve\nmurmured and she groaned.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let this happen.\u201d She muttered, more to\nherself than to them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Nat.\u201d Tony promised, but he\ncouldn\u2019t be sure. This could blow everything up. </p><hr><p>Nat had been gone for about four hours now, yet Steve was\nstill worried about her. He knew that she deeply cared about Clint. To her that\nwas not a drunken mistake. And now she might lose Clint all together. Steve\ncouldn\u2019t imagine what that must feel like. Things had gone so smoothly when\nSteve and Tony had fallen for one another, there was always the fear that\nthey\u2019d screw everything up, but they had beaten the odds. They were getting <i>married</i>. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Tony was playing with Peter, moving\naround one of his toy cars.</p><p>\u201cNat never cries, she is <i>never</i>\nscared. This is terrifying her.\u201d Steve thought about calling her but knew she\nwouldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cShe and Clint are both adults. They can make their own\ndecisions, their own mistakes. It takes two to tango Steve. He wanted it just\nas much as she did.\u201d Steve frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo buts! This time next week those two will be the best of\nfriends and will have forgotten all about this.\u201d Steve knew Tony didn\u2019t truly\nbelieve that, but maybe it was true. Maybe they\u2019d agree to pretend like it\nnever happened, and everything would be fine. Unless they didn\u2019t want to\npretend like it never happened. This was such a complicated mess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cthis could mess up everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But pick a tablecloth, it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d\nTony smiled and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNope, you are the one that will be picking a tablecloth.\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Finally it felt like Steve\u2019s life was coming together. Not\nonly did he get the kid, he got the guy. He got Tony Stark. He\u2019d seen it from\nthe beginning, he had seen a future with Tony. Now he got to live it. But he\nwas worried about Nat, who <i>didn\u2019t</i> get\nto be with Clint. The person she could see her future with. Nat had avoided\nClint for three days. Not that he\u2019d exactly gone looking for her. Steve had\ntold her to simply suck it up and go talk to him. If she couldn\u2019t talk about it\nthen she really shouldn\u2019t be doing it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dad.\u201d She had said to him. That made Steve\nsmile, he was always worried that he was going to be a bad father. That Peter\nwould one day grow up to hate him. Steve made a promise to himself to never let\nthat happen. He would be here, by Tony and Peter\u2019s sides, no matter what. No\none and nothing would come between them. He paced around the apartment, which\nfelt smaller and smaller with every passing day. It was strange to imagine not\nliving in this apartment. But Peter was getting bigger and the amount of toys\nhe had was borderline ridiculous. They needed a bigger place. Tony had\neventually settled on a tablecloth. Steve had merely smirked and then told him\nto pick an envelope for the invites. Tony had glared at him for at least five\nminutes. Tony was presently with Peter in his workshop. He was taking more\ntests, seeing if anything had changed with Peter. Steve doubted it, but Tony\nliked to check up on Peter every couple months. It was probably for the best. Steve\nbegan cleaning up the apartment when Natasha finally called him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Steve asked, continuing to put away some\nof Peter\u2019s toys.</p><p>\u201cWell we talked. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat does sort of mean?\u201d Steve asked and stood on a lego.\nHe swore and Nat remained silent for a while.</p><p>\u201cDid you really just say <i>fuck</i>?\u201d\nshe asked and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat does sort of mean?\u201d Steve repeated, suddenly\nfrustrated.</p><p>\u201cIt means we sort of talked and then we definitely shouted\nand there was definitely the word <i>mistake</i>\nand <i>I hate you</i> thrown in there and\nnow we\u2019re not talking.\u201d Steve groaned, that was the opposite of what Natasha\nhad planned.</p><p>\u201ctell me the whole story.\u201d Steve murmured. </p><p>\u201cI said I wanted to talk. He said he knew it was a mistake.\nThat he was back with Laura. She already knew and said she was fine with it. I\nsaid I wasn\u2019t fine with it and that\u2019s when we started arguing.\u201d Steve could\nimagine Nat shrugging her shoulders. Steve tried to imagine how she must be\nfeeling, but he couldn\u2019t come up with the right emotion. Was this how Bucky\nfelt when Steve had chosen Tony? Was this how Tony had felt when he thought\nSteve was going to choose Bucky? </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Nat.\u201d was all Steve managed. </p><p>\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s probably for the best. We\u2019ll be\nback to normal in a week or two.\u201d That was the part Steve hated the most.\nKnowing that Clint and Nat would just slip back into their old ways. They\u2019d\npretend like it had never happened. Rather than actually talk through it. Steve\nmade another promise to himself that he would always communicate with Tony, he\nwould never shut Tony out. Communication really was key in a relationship. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Peter seemed fine. Normal. His test results were identical\nto three months ago. Peter had fallen asleep on a couch in Tony\u2019s workshop. He\ntook a photo and sent it to Steve. </p><p><i>Adorable</i>. Was\nSteve\u2019s response. </p><p><i>Do you want me to pick\nup dinner on the way home? Thinking Chinese.</i></p><p><i>Yes! Also I think we\nshould get a house.</i></p><p>Tony read the text at least six times before responding.</p><p><i>A house?</i></p><p><i>The apartment is just\nso small. It was fine when Peter was a baby, but he is getting older. Plus,\nwouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a bigger space?</i> </p><p>It would be nice. <i>Really</i>\nnice. Tony thought about it. A house. He knew it would happen eventually,\nespecially as Peter got older. He found himself nodding, liking the idea more\nand more with each passing second.</p><p><i>Ok.</i></p><p><i>Ok?</i></p><p><i>Ok.</i></p><p>And Tony was grinning. He wasn\u2019t sure how he had gotten so\nlucky to have both Steve and Peter. But he was sure damn grateful that he did\nget to have both of them. He looked back at Peter and had the same thought he\u2019d\nbeen having for three years. <i>My son</i>. </p><p> happen eventually,\nespecially as Peter got older.

Steve literally thought you merely had to book a venue, get a\ncake and do the ceremony. Maybe get a pizza afterwards. He had never considered\nthe flowers and tablecloths and the type of envelope to use for their\ninvitations. Tony on the other hand had made list after list about all the\nthings they needed to organise. And they had already agreed on doing a small\nwedding. The last thing Steve wanted was to get up in front of a crowd of\npeople he didn\u2019t really know and to make a spectacle of himself. He just wanted\nto marry the man he loved in front of the people he loved. But big or small,\nSteve wasn\u2019t able to escape the tablecloths.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care about tablecloths?\u201d Steve asked suddenly.\nHe heard Tony sigh and look up from his tablet, he was working on something. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked, he wasn\u2019t really listening so Steve\ndidn\u2019t bother repeating it. After a minute or two, Tony turned the tablet off\nand made a point of giving Steve his full attention.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the tablecloths <i>so</i>\nimportant?\u201d Steve asked and Tony gave Steve a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cthey\u2019re not.\u201d He said simply, which only irritated Steve.</p><p>\u201cThen why have I spent the past hour looking at and feeling\ndifferent tablecloths?\u201d Steve demanded and Tony chuckled. Steve didn\u2019t see what\nwas so funny. He couldn\u2019t get passed the fact that Tony didn\u2019t even think that\nthe tablecloths were an important part of their wedding.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest with you Steve, I don\u2019t give two flying shits\nabout the tablecloths,\u201d Tony ran a hand through his hair and Steve let out a\nfrustrated groan. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s adorable that you care so much.\u201d Tony\nsmirked.</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve\nwhined and Tony laughed.</p><p>\u201cthe tablecloths are important because they\u2019re a part of our\nwedding. I want everything to be perfect.\u201d Tony kissed Steve and Steve melted\ninto the kiss. This was perfect. Tablecloths and flowers and seating plans were\nirrelevant. The only perfect wedding would be one where Steve was marrying\nTony. Nothing else mattered. </p><p>\u201cWell since the tablecloths aren\u2019t so important,\u201d Steve\npulled away from the kiss and they were grinning like the biggest dorks in the\nworld. \u201cYou can decide which one we use.\u201d Steve smirked and Tony frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhich was your favourite?\u201d Tony asked and Steve shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhichever one you pick.\u201d Steve stood up from the couch and\nstretched, he considered going for a run. But then there was banging on their\nfront door. Steve and Tony shared a look and Steve went to go answer it. He\ntripped on at least five of Peter\u2019s toys and made a mental note to clean up\nafter he dealt with whoever was at the door. But when Steve swung the door\nopen, he saw one of the most terrifying things of his life. </p><p>Natasha was crying. </p><p>\u201cNat?\u201d Steve asked with wide eyes and she flung herself at\nhim. She wrapped her arms tightly around his body and began crying into Steve\u2019s\nchest. Steve slowly wrapped his arms around her and looked over at Tony, who\nlooked just as confused as Steve was.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tony asked and she only cried harder.</p><p>\u201cNat you need to calm down. It\u2019s going to be alright. What\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d Steve asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI screwed up Steve, I made a <i>huge</i> mistake.\u201d She pulled away from Steve and began to pace around\nthe apartment.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Steve asked. She merely glared at one of\nPeter\u2019s toys that she had stepped on. She was clearly frustrated with herself\nand seemed to be moving from all out panic to anger.</p><p>\u201cyou have to promise not to tell anyone!\u201d She pleaded and\nSteve nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony murmured softly, clearly just as worried as\nSteve was about her. Nat was usually level headed, the calm one out of all the\nAvengers.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI slept with Clint.\u201d Well, shit.\n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Tony had not expected Nat to say that. He had thought she\u2019d\nkilled someone, or been found by some Hydra agents, something other than what\nshe had actually done. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you slept with Clint?\u201d Tony asked,\nbreaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cWell, I went to his house to talk to him and he had just\nhad a massive fight with Laura.\u201d She was pacing again and Tony felt his stomach\ntwisting and churning. </p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Tony coaxed and she sighed, finally sitting down\non their crappy couch. Tony did not miss the days when he used to sleep on that\ncouch.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I was comforting him and he\u2019d said she\u2019d ended it.\nSo we started drinking and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo you were both drunk?\u201d Steve asked, that could be fixed.\nShe could easily peg it as a drunken mistake, she didn\u2019t need to be freaking\nout.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was slightly tipsy.\u201d Usually she had her guard up,\nbut Clint always managed to walk past any walls that Natasha managed to put up.</p><p>\u201cAnd Clint?\u201d She put her head in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI think he was sober, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She was crying again. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Nat, this isn\u2019t the end of the\nworld.\u201d Tony sat down on the horrid couch and put an arm around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve <i>never</i> done\nsomething so stupid before.\u201d Tony believed her. He couldn\u2019t imagine Natasha\nmaking irrational decisions. </p><p>\u201cWe know.\u201d Steve sat down on the other side of Nat, they sat\nin silence for a long time.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter?\u201d Nat asked suddenly, Tony was relieved he\nwasn\u2019t here right now. He didn\u2019t want Peter to see Nat like this. So scared.</p><p>\u201cNext door.\u201d Steve answered.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Clint say, afterwards?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and\nshe put her head in her hands. </p><p>\u201cHe said we\u2019d talk later.\u201d She muttered and Tony frowned. It\nwasn\u2019t necessarily bad or good. It was neutral.</p><p>\u201cWell at least he didn\u2019t say it was a mistake.\u201d Steve\nmurmured and she groaned.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let this happen.\u201d She muttered, more to\nherself than to them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Nat.\u201d Tony promised, but he\ncouldn\u2019t be sure. This could blow everything up. </p><hr><p>Nat had been gone for about four hours now, yet Steve was\nstill worried about her. He knew that she deeply cared about Clint. To her that\nwas not a drunken mistake. And now she might lose Clint all together. Steve\ncouldn\u2019t imagine what that must feel like. Things had gone so smoothly when\nSteve and Tony had fallen for one another, there was always the fear that\nthey\u2019d screw everything up, but they had beaten the odds. They were getting <i>married</i>. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Tony was playing with Peter, moving\naround one of his toy cars.</p><p>\u201cNat never cries, she is <i>never</i>\nscared. This is terrifying her.\u201d Steve thought about calling her but knew she\nwouldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cShe and Clint are both adults. They can make their own\ndecisions, their own mistakes. It takes two to tango Steve. He wanted it just\nas much as she did.\u201d Steve frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo buts! This time next week those two will be the best of\nfriends and will have forgotten all about this.\u201d Steve knew Tony didn\u2019t truly\nbelieve that, but maybe it was true. Maybe they\u2019d agree to pretend like it\nnever happened, and everything would be fine. Unless they didn\u2019t want to\npretend like it never happened. This was such a complicated mess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cthis could mess up everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But pick a tablecloth, it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d\nTony smiled and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNope, you are the one that will be picking a tablecloth.\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Finally it felt like Steve\u2019s life was coming together. Not\nonly did he get the kid, he got the guy. He got Tony Stark. He\u2019d seen it from\nthe beginning, he had seen a future with Tony. Now he got to live it. But he\nwas worried about Nat, who <i>didn\u2019t</i> get\nto be with Clint. The person she could see her future with. Nat had avoided\nClint for three days. Not that he\u2019d exactly gone looking for her. Steve had\ntold her to simply suck it up and go talk to him. If she couldn\u2019t talk about it\nthen she really shouldn\u2019t be doing it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dad.\u201d She had said to him. That made Steve\nsmile, he was always worried that he was going to be a bad father. That Peter\nwould one day grow up to hate him. Steve made a promise to himself to never let\nthat happen. He would be here, by Tony and Peter\u2019s sides, no matter what. No\none and nothing would come between them. He paced around the apartment, which\nfelt smaller and smaller with every passing day. It was strange to imagine not\nliving in this apartment. But Peter was getting bigger and the amount of toys\nhe had was borderline ridiculous. They needed a bigger place. Tony had\neventually settled on a tablecloth. Steve had merely smirked and then told him\nto pick an envelope for the invites. Tony had glared at him for at least five\nminutes. Tony was presently with Peter in his workshop. He was taking more\ntests, seeing if anything had changed with Peter. Steve doubted it, but Tony\nliked to check up on Peter every couple months. It was probably for the best. Steve\nbegan cleaning up the apartment when Natasha finally called him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Steve asked, continuing to put away some\nof Peter\u2019s toys.</p><p>\u201cWell we talked. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat does sort of mean?\u201d Steve asked and stood on a lego.\nHe swore and Nat remained silent for a while.</p><p>\u201cDid you really just say <i>fuck</i>?\u201d\nshe asked and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat does sort of mean?\u201d Steve repeated, suddenly\nfrustrated.</p><p>\u201cIt means we sort of talked and then we definitely shouted\nand there was definitely the word <i>mistake</i>\nand <i>I hate you</i> thrown in there and\nnow we\u2019re not talking.\u201d Steve groaned, that was the opposite of what Natasha\nhad planned.</p><p>\u201ctell me the whole story.\u201d Steve murmured. </p><p>\u201cI said I wanted to talk. He said he knew it was a mistake.\nThat he was back with Laura. She already knew and said she was fine with it. I\nsaid I wasn\u2019t fine with it and that\u2019s when we started arguing.\u201d Steve could\nimagine Nat shrugging her shoulders. Steve tried to imagine how she must be\nfeeling, but he couldn\u2019t come up with the right emotion. Was this how Bucky\nfelt when Steve had chosen Tony? Was this how Tony had felt when he thought\nSteve was going to choose Bucky? </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Nat.\u201d was all Steve managed. </p><p>\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s probably for the best. We\u2019ll be\nback to normal in a week or two.\u201d That was the part Steve hated the most.\nKnowing that Clint and Nat would just slip back into their old ways. They\u2019d\npretend like it had never happened. Rather than actually talk through it. Steve\nmade another promise to himself that he would always communicate with Tony, he\nwould never shut Tony out. Communication really was key in a relationship. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Peter seemed fine. Normal. His test results were identical\nto three months ago. Peter had fallen asleep on a couch in Tony\u2019s workshop. He\ntook a photo and sent it to Steve. </p><p><i>Adorable</i>. Was\nSteve\u2019s response. </p><p><i>Do you want me to pick\nup dinner on the way home? Thinking Chinese.</i></p><p><i>Yes! Also I think we\nshould get a house.</i></p><p>Tony read the text at least six times before responding.</p><p><i>A house?</i></p><p><i>The apartment is just\nso small. It was fine when Peter was a baby, but he is getting older. Plus,\nwouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a bigger space?</i> </p><p>It would be nice. <i>Really</i>\nnice. Tony thought about it. A house. He knew it would happen eventually,\nespecially as Peter got older. He found himself nodding, liking the idea more\nand more with each passing second.</p><p><i>Ok.</i></p><p><i>Ok?</i></p><p><i>Ok.</i></p><p>And Tony was grinning. He wasn\u2019t sure how he had gotten so\nlucky to have both Steve and Peter. But he was sure damn grateful that he did\nget to have both of them. He looked back at Peter and had the same thought he\u2019d\nbeen having for three years. <i>My son</i>. </p><p> happen eventually,\nespecially as Peter got older.

Steve literally thought you merely had to book a venue, get a\ncake and do the ceremony. Maybe get a pizza afterwards. He had never considered\nthe flowers and tablecloths and the type of envelope to use for their\ninvitations. Tony on the other hand had made list after list about all the\nthings they needed to organise. And they had already agreed on doing a small\nwedding. The last thing Steve wanted was to get up in front of a crowd of\npeople he didn\u2019t really know and to make a spectacle of himself. He just wanted\nto marry the man he loved in front of the people he loved. But big or small,\nSteve wasn\u2019t able to escape the tablecloths.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care about tablecloths?\u201d Steve asked suddenly.\nHe heard Tony sigh and look up from his tablet, he was working on something. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked, he wasn\u2019t really listening so Steve\ndidn\u2019t bother repeating it. After a minute or two, Tony turned the tablet off\nand made a point of giving Steve his full attention.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the tablecloths <i>so</i>\nimportant?\u201d Steve asked and Tony gave Steve a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cthey\u2019re not.\u201d He said simply, which only irritated Steve.</p><p>\u201cThen why have I spent the past hour looking at and feeling\ndifferent tablecloths?\u201d Steve demanded and Tony chuckled. Steve didn\u2019t see what\nwas so funny. He couldn\u2019t get passed the fact that Tony didn\u2019t even think that\nthe tablecloths were an important part of their wedding.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest with you Steve, I don\u2019t give two flying shits\nabout the tablecloths,\u201d Tony ran a hand through his hair and Steve let out a\nfrustrated groan. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s adorable that you care so much.\u201d Tony\nsmirked.</p><p>\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve\nwhined and Tony laughed.</p><p>\u201cthe tablecloths are important because they\u2019re a part of our\nwedding. I want everything to be perfect.\u201d Tony kissed Steve and Steve melted\ninto the kiss. This was perfect. Tablecloths and flowers and seating plans were\nirrelevant. The only perfect wedding would be one where Steve was marrying\nTony. Nothing else mattered. </p><p>\u201cWell since the tablecloths aren\u2019t so important,\u201d Steve\npulled away from the kiss and they were grinning like the biggest dorks in the\nworld. \u201cYou can decide which one we use.\u201d Steve smirked and Tony frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhich was your favourite?\u201d Tony asked and Steve shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhichever one you pick.\u201d Steve stood up from the couch and\nstretched, he considered going for a run. But then there was banging on their\nfront door. Steve and Tony shared a look and Steve went to go answer it. He\ntripped on at least five of Peter\u2019s toys and made a mental note to clean up\nafter he dealt with whoever was at the door. But when Steve swung the door\nopen, he saw one of the most terrifying things of his life. </p><p>Natasha was crying. </p><p>\u201cNat?\u201d Steve asked with wide eyes and she flung herself at\nhim. She wrapped her arms tightly around his body and began crying into Steve\u2019s\nchest. Steve slowly wrapped his arms around her and looked over at Tony, who\nlooked just as confused as Steve was.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tony asked and she only cried harder.</p><p>\u201cNat you need to calm down. It\u2019s going to be alright. What\u2019s\ngoing on?\u201d Steve asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI screwed up Steve, I made a <i>huge</i> mistake.\u201d She pulled away from Steve and began to pace around\nthe apartment.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Steve asked. She merely glared at one of\nPeter\u2019s toys that she had stepped on. She was clearly frustrated with herself\nand seemed to be moving from all out panic to anger.</p><p>\u201cyou have to promise not to tell anyone!\u201d She pleaded and\nSteve nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tony murmured softly, clearly just as worried as\nSteve was about her. Nat was usually level headed, the calm one out of all the\nAvengers.</p><p>\n\n\u201cI slept with Clint.\u201d Well, shit.\n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Tony had not expected Nat to say that. He had thought she\u2019d\nkilled someone, or been found by some Hydra agents, something other than what\nshe had actually done. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you slept with Clint?\u201d Tony asked,\nbreaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cWell, I went to his house to talk to him and he had just\nhad a massive fight with Laura.\u201d She was pacing again and Tony felt his stomach\ntwisting and churning. </p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Tony coaxed and she sighed, finally sitting down\non their crappy couch. Tony did not miss the days when he used to sleep on that\ncouch.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I was comforting him and he\u2019d said she\u2019d ended it.\nSo we started drinking and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSo you were both drunk?\u201d Steve asked, that could be fixed.\nShe could easily peg it as a drunken mistake, she didn\u2019t need to be freaking\nout.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was slightly tipsy.\u201d Usually she had her guard up,\nbut Clint always managed to walk past any walls that Natasha managed to put up.</p><p>\u201cAnd Clint?\u201d She put her head in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI think he was sober, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She was crying again. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Nat, this isn\u2019t the end of the\nworld.\u201d Tony sat down on the horrid couch and put an arm around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve <i>never</i> done\nsomething so stupid before.\u201d Tony believed her. He couldn\u2019t imagine Natasha\nmaking irrational decisions. </p><p>\u201cWe know.\u201d Steve sat down on the other side of Nat, they sat\nin silence for a long time.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter?\u201d Nat asked suddenly, Tony was relieved he\nwasn\u2019t here right now. He didn\u2019t want Peter to see Nat like this. So scared.</p><p>\u201cNext door.\u201d Steve answered.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Clint say, afterwards?\u201d Tony asked suddenly and\nshe put her head in her hands. </p><p>\u201cHe said we\u2019d talk later.\u201d She muttered and Tony frowned. It\nwasn\u2019t necessarily bad or good. It was neutral.</p><p>\u201cWell at least he didn\u2019t say it was a mistake.\u201d Steve\nmurmured and she groaned.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let this happen.\u201d She muttered, more to\nherself than to them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Nat.\u201d Tony promised, but he\ncouldn\u2019t be sure. This could blow everything up. </p><hr><p>Nat had been gone for about four hours now, yet Steve was\nstill worried about her. He knew that she deeply cared about Clint. To her that\nwas not a drunken mistake. And now she might lose Clint all together. Steve\ncouldn\u2019t imagine what that must feel like. Things had gone so smoothly when\nSteve and Tony had fallen for one another, there was always the fear that\nthey\u2019d screw everything up, but they had beaten the odds. They were getting <i>married</i>. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Tony was playing with Peter, moving\naround one of his toy cars.</p><p>\u201cNat never cries, she is <i>never</i>\nscared. This is terrifying her.\u201d Steve thought about calling her but knew she\nwouldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cShe and Clint are both adults. They can make their own\ndecisions, their own mistakes. It takes two to tango Steve. He wanted it just\nas much as she did.\u201d Steve frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo buts! This time next week those two will be the best of\nfriends and will have forgotten all about this.\u201d Steve knew Tony didn\u2019t truly\nbelieve that, but maybe it was true. Maybe they\u2019d agree to pretend like it\nnever happened, and everything would be fine. Unless they didn\u2019t want to\npretend like it never happened. This was such a complicated mess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cthis could mess up everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But pick a tablecloth, it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d\nTony smiled and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNope, you are the one that will be picking a tablecloth.\u201d\nTony rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>\n\n\u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d\n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Finally it felt like Steve\u2019s life was coming together. Not\nonly did he get the kid, he got the guy. He got Tony Stark. He\u2019d seen it from\nthe beginning, he had seen a future with Tony. Now he got to live it. But he\nwas worried about Nat, who <i>didn\u2019t</i> get\nto be with Clint. The person she could see her future with. Nat had avoided\nClint for three days. Not that he\u2019d exactly gone looking for her. Steve had\ntold her to simply suck it up and go talk to him. If she couldn\u2019t talk about it\nthen she really shouldn\u2019t be doing it. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dad.\u201d She had said to him. That made Steve\nsmile, he was always worried that he was going to be a bad father. That Peter\nwould one day grow up to hate him. Steve made a promise to himself to never let\nthat happen. He would be here, by Tony and Peter\u2019s sides, no matter what. No\none and nothing would come between them. He paced around the apartment, which\nfelt smaller and smaller with every passing day. It was strange to imagine not\nliving in this apartment. But Peter was getting bigger and the amount of toys\nhe had was borderline ridiculous. They needed a bigger place. Tony had\neventually settled on a tablecloth. Steve had merely smirked and then told him\nto pick an envelope for the invites. Tony had glared at him for at least five\nminutes. Tony was presently with Peter in his workshop. He was taking more\ntests, seeing if anything had changed with Peter. Steve doubted it, but Tony\nliked to check up on Peter every couple months. It was probably for the best. Steve\nbegan cleaning up the apartment when Natasha finally called him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Steve asked, continuing to put away some\nof Peter\u2019s toys.</p><p>\u201cWell we talked. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat does sort of mean?\u201d Steve asked and stood on a lego.\nHe swore and Nat remained silent for a while.</p><p>\u201cDid you really just say <i>fuck</i>?\u201d\nshe asked and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat does sort of mean?\u201d Steve repeated, suddenly\nfrustrated.</p><p>\u201cIt means we sort of talked and then we definitely shouted\nand there was definitely the word <i>mistake</i>\nand <i>I hate you</i> thrown in there and\nnow we\u2019re not talking.\u201d Steve groaned, that was the opposite of what Natasha\nhad planned.</p><p>\u201ctell me the whole story.\u201d Steve murmured. </p><p>\u201cI said I wanted to talk. He said he knew it was a mistake.\nThat he was back with Laura. She already knew and said she was fine with it. I\nsaid I wasn\u2019t fine with it and that\u2019s when we started arguing.\u201d Steve could\nimagine Nat shrugging her shoulders. Steve tried to imagine how she must be\nfeeling, but he couldn\u2019t come up with the right emotion. Was this how Bucky\nfelt when Steve had chosen Tony? Was this how Tony had felt when he thought\nSteve was going to choose Bucky? </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Nat.\u201d was all Steve managed. </p><p>\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s probably for the best. We\u2019ll be\nback to normal in a week or two.\u201d That was the part Steve hated the most.\nKnowing that Clint and Nat would just slip back into their old ways. They\u2019d\npretend like it had never happened. Rather than actually talk through it. Steve\nmade another promise to himself that he would always communicate with Tony, he\nwould never shut Tony out. Communication really was key in a relationship. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Peter seemed fine. Normal. His test results were identical\nto three months ago. Peter had fallen asleep on a couch in Tony\u2019s workshop. He\ntook a photo and sent it to Steve. </p><p><i>Adorable</i>. Was\nSteve\u2019s response. </p><p><i>Do you want me to pick\nup dinner on the way home? Thinking Chinese.</i></p><p><i>Yes! Also I think we\nshould get a house.</i></p><p>Tony read the text at least six times before responding.</p><p><i>A house?</i></p><p><i>The apartment is just\nso small. It was fine when Peter was a baby, but he is getting older. Plus,\nwouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a bigger space?</i> </p><p>It would be nice. <i>Really</i>\nnice. Tony thought about it. A house.

He wasn\u2019t sure how he had gotten so\nlucky to have both Steve and Peter. But he was sure damn grateful that he did\nget to have both of them.

Tony did not miss the days when he used to sleep on that\ncouch.</p><p>&ldquo;And then I was comforting him and he&rsquo;d said she&rsquo;d ended it.\nSo we started drinking and-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you were both drunk?&rdquo; Steve asked, that could be fixed.\nShe could easily peg it as a drunken mistake, she didn&rsquo;t need to be freaking\nout.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I was slightly tipsy.&rdquo; Usually she had her guard up,\nbut Clint always managed to walk past any walls that Natasha managed to put up.</p><p>&ldquo;And Clint?&rdquo; She put her head in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I think he was sober, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She was crying again. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be alright Nat, this isn&rsquo;t the end of the\nworld.&rdquo; Tony sat down on the horrid couch and put an arm around her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve <i>never</i> done\nsomething so stupid before.&rdquo; Tony believed her. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine Natasha\nmaking irrational decisions. </p><p>&ldquo;We know.&rdquo; Steve sat down on the other side of Nat, they sat\nin silence for a long time.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo; Nat asked suddenly, Tony was relieved he\nwasn&rsquo;t here right now. He didn&rsquo;t want Peter to see Nat like this. So scared.</p><p>&ldquo;Next door.&rdquo; Steve answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did Clint say, afterwards?&rdquo; Tony asked suddenly and\nshe put her head in her hands. </p><p>&ldquo;He said we&rsquo;d talk later.&rdquo; She muttered and Tony frowned. It\nwasn&rsquo;t necessarily bad or good. It was neutral.</p><p>&ldquo;Well at least he didn&rsquo;t say it was a mistake.&rdquo; Steve\nmurmured and she groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let this happen.&rdquo; She muttered, more to\nherself than to them.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be alright Nat.&rdquo; Tony promised, but he\ncouldn&rsquo;t be sure. This could blow everything up. </p><hr /><p>Nat had been gone for about four hours now, yet Steve was\nstill worried about her. He knew that she deeply cared about Clint. To her that\nwas not a drunken mistake. And now she might lose Clint all together. Steve\ncouldn&rsquo;t imagine what that must feel like. Things had gone so smoothly when\nSteve and Tony had fallen for one another, there was always the fear that\nthey&rsquo;d screw everything up, but they had beaten the odds. They were getting <i>married</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be alright.&rdquo; Tony was playing with Peter, moving\naround one of his toy cars.</p><p>&ldquo;Nat never cries, she is <i>never</i>\nscared. This is terrifying her.&rdquo; Steve thought about calling her but knew she\nwouldn&rsquo;t answer.</p><p>&ldquo;She and Clint are both adults. They can make their own\ndecisions, their own mistakes. It takes two to tango Steve. He wanted it just\nas much as she did.&rdquo; Steve frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;But-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No buts! This time next week those two will be the best of\nfriends and will have forgotten all about this.&rdquo; Steve knew Tony didn&rsquo;t truly\nbelieve that, but maybe it was true. Maybe they&rsquo;d agree to pretend like it\nnever happened, and everything would be fine. Unless they didn&rsquo;t want to\npretend like it never happened. This was such a complicated mess.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really worried about her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;this could mess up everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. But pick a tablecloth, it&rsquo;ll make you feel better.&rdquo;\nTony smiled and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, you are the one that will be picking a tablecloth.&rdquo;\nTony rolled his eyes but nodded.</p><p>\n\n&ldquo;It was worth a shot.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n</p><hr /><p>Finally it felt like Steve&rsquo;s life was coming together. Not\nonly did he get the kid, he got the guy. He got Tony Stark. He&rsquo;d seen it from\nthe beginning, he had seen a future with Tony. Now he got to live it. But he\nwas worried about Nat, who <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> get\nto be with Clint. The person she could see her future with. Nat had avoided\nClint for three days. Not that he&rsquo;d exactly gone looking for her. Steve had\ntold her to simply suck it up and go talk to him. If she couldn&rsquo;t talk about it\nthen she really shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a dad.&rdquo; She had said to him. That made Steve\nsmile, he was always worried that he was going to be a bad father. That Peter\nwould one day grow up to hate him. Steve made a promise to himself to never let\nthat happen. He would be here, by Tony and Peter&rsquo;s sides, no matter what. No\none and nothing would come between them. He paced around the apartment, which\nfelt smaller and smaller with every passing day. It was strange to imagine not\nliving in this apartment. But Peter was getting bigger and the amount of toys\nhe had was borderline ridiculous. They needed a bigger place. Tony had\neventually settled on a tablecloth. Steve had merely smirked and then told him\nto pick an envelope for the invites. Tony had glared at him for at least five\nminutes. Tony was presently with Peter in his workshop. He was taking more\ntests, seeing if anything had changed with Peter. Steve doubted it, but Tony\nliked to check up on Peter every couple months. It was probably for the best. Steve\nbegan cleaning up the apartment when Natasha finally called him.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Steve asked, continuing to put away some\nof Peter&rsquo;s toys.</p><p>&ldquo;Well we talked. Sort of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;what does sort of mean?&rdquo; Steve asked and stood on a lego.\nHe swore and Nat remained silent for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you really just say <i>fuck</i>?&rdquo;\nshe asked and Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What does sort of mean?&rdquo; Steve repeated, suddenly\nfrustrated.</p><p>&ldquo;It means we sort of talked and then we definitely shouted\nand there was definitely the word <i>mistake</i>\nand <i>I hate you</i> thrown in there and\nnow we&rsquo;re not talking.&rdquo; Steve groaned, that was the opposite of what Natasha\nhad planned.</p><p>&ldquo;tell me the whole story.&rdquo; Steve murmured. </p><p>&ldquo;I said I wanted to talk. He said he knew it was a mistake.\nThat he was back with Laura. She already knew and said she was fine with it. I\nsaid I wasn&rsquo;t fine with it and that&rsquo;s when we started arguing.&rdquo; Steve could\nimagine Nat shrugging her shoulders. Steve tried to imagine how she must be\nfeeling, but he couldn&rsquo;t come up with the right emotion. Was this how Bucky\nfelt when Steve had chosen Tony? Was this how Tony had felt when he thought\nSteve was going to choose Bucky? </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Nat.&rdquo; was all Steve managed. </p><p>\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be. It&rsquo;s probably for the best. We&rsquo;ll be\nback to normal in a week or two.&rdquo; That was the part Steve hated the most.\nKnowing that Clint and Nat would just slip back into their old ways. They&rsquo;d\npretend like it had never happened. Rather than actually talk through it. Steve\nmade another promise to himself that he would always communicate with Tony, he\nwould never shut Tony out. Communication really was key in a relationship. \n\n\n\n</p><hr /><p>Peter seemed fine. Normal. His test results were identical\nto three months ago. Peter had fallen asleep on a couch in Tony&rsquo;s workshop. He\ntook a photo and sent it to Steve. </p><p><i>Adorable</i>. Was\nSteve&rsquo;s response. </p><p><i>Do you want me to pick\nup dinner on the way home? Thinking Chinese.</i></p><p><i>Yes! Also I think we\nshould get a house.</i></p><p>Tony read the text at least six times before responding.</p><p><i>A house?</i></p><p><i>The apartment is just\nso small. It was fine when Peter was a baby, but he is getting older. Plus,\nwouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have a bigger space?</i> </p><p>It would be nice. <i>Really</i>\nnice. Tony thought about it. A house. He knew it would happen eventually,\nespecially as Peter got older. He found himself nodding, liking the idea more\nand more with each passing second.</p><p><i>Ok.</i></p><p><i>Ok?</i></p><p><i>Ok.</i></p><p>And Tony was grinning. He wasn&rsquo;t sure how he had gotten so\nlucky to have both Steve and Peter. But he was sure damn grateful that he did\nget to have both of them. He looked back at Peter and had the same thought he&rsquo;d\nbeen having for three years. <i>My son</i>. </p><p> happen eventually,\nespecially as Peter got older.

It did little take away the images that flashed behind his eyelids as he closed them. His head still hurt, and his heart pounded hard in his chest. He\u2019d never felt so helpless in that moment. If you asked any of the team, who still didn\u2019t know what happened, they could tell you what they saw happen to him. </p><p><!-- more --></p><p>The color had been drained from his face, his eyes rolling back into his head. It was too much for his head to wrap around, to see that. His knees never bent, he just fell like a plank of wood. His head bounced off the conference room table, and he laid there, motionless. A small line of blood trickled from the open cut on his forehead, already bruising from the impact. </p><p><br/></p><p>On the other side of the room, the door to the conference room opened so fast it nearly fell off the hinges. The glass door slammed against the wall with such force that it shattered into pieces. The metal frame dented from where his hand had gripped it as he tried to stay steady on his feet. His hand covered his mouth as he desperately tried to assuage the bile that rose up his throat threatening to escape.  </p><p><br/></p><p>Behind in the room, there was pandamonium. Clint grabbed the med kit from the corner of the room. He pulled out the gauze and placed it on the wound on Steve\u2019s head. It took Clint, Sam and Tony all their combined efforts to pull his limp body into a chair. Wanda had run out to grab a broom to clean up the mess of broken glass that was scattered across the floor, then left without word. </p><p><br/></p><p>Once he\u2019d woken up, his mind went into a flurry of panic. His eyes had shot open and he had pushed himself away from everyone. He looked like a wild animal, his eyes frantically moved from each person in the room. His breathing was erratic, his heart pounding so hard against his chest that each person in the room could hear it. Every movement forced him to flinch as if he was afraid that he was going to hit. </p><p><br/></p><p>Without warning, he quickly rose from his chair and strode out of the room. Everyone quickly parted from his path, afraid of the feral look that encompassed his eyes. He reached his bedroom door faster than he normally did. He couldn\u2019t even remember the last few minutes. Everything seemed to be happening so fast, it was blurry and spinning, it felt like it was in slow motion. </p><p><br/></p><p>It made him dizzy. He gripped the door frame tightly, steadying his uneven steps. When he finally made it to the bathroom, he turned the shower on as hot as it could go and he collapsed to the ground. He pulled his knees to his chest and sat. Everything felt numb. He couldn\u2019t believe it, he didn\u2019t want it to be true but he knew it was. </p><p><br/></p><p>He stood in the shower until the water ran cold, tears streaming down his face in earnest. Steve pulled himself from the shower, wrapping a towel around himself as he made his way into his bedroom. He moved slowly about the room, barely comprehending the actions he did as he got himself dressed. Once dressed, he grabbed a soft blanket off his bed wrapped it around his shoulders, and collapsed onto the bed. </p><p><br/></p><p>He sat for a while, wrapped in his thoughts. He wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d been sitting there, could\u2019ve been minutes. Could\u2019ve been hours. A soft knock on the door pulled his attention away from the spot on the wall he\u2019d been staring at for however long since he\u2019d gotten out of the shower. </p><p><br/></p><p>Bucky slowly opened the door and peeked his head in. His eyes were red and puffy, tears lay on his cheeks untouched. There was a stiff silence between the two. It wasn\u2019t one of anger, but one of mutual hurt and pain. This was unbearable for them. It shook the very foundations they had built their modern lives on. </p><p><br/></p><p>Steve slowly stood from his place on the bed, a choked sob making it past the large lump that had been forming in his throat. They met in the middle of the room and threw their arms around each other. Tears began to fall from both men again as the reality of the situation slammed into them again. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt was her.\u201d</p><h2><i>If you liked this, let me know!

It was too much for his head to wrap around, to see that. His knees never bent, he just fell like a plank of wood. His head bounced off the conference room table, and he laid there, motionless. A small line of blood trickled from the open cut on his forehead, already bruising from the impact. </p><p><br></p><p>On the other side of the room, the door to the conference room opened so fast it nearly fell off the hinges. The glass door slammed against the wall with such force that it shattered into pieces. The metal frame dented from where his hand had gripped it as he tried to stay steady on his feet. His hand covered his mouth as he desperately tried to assuage the bile that rose up his throat threatening to escape.  </p><p><br></p><p>Behind in the room, there was pandamonium. Clint grabbed the med kit from the corner of the room. He pulled out the gauze and placed it on the wound on Steve\u2019s head. It took Clint, Sam and Tony all their combined efforts to pull his limp body into a chair. Wanda had run out to grab a broom to clean up the mess of broken glass that was scattered across the floor, then left without word. </p><p><br></p><p>Once he\u2019d woken up, his mind went into a flurry of panic. His eyes had shot open and he had pushed himself away from everyone. He looked like a wild animal, his eyes frantically moved from each person in the room. His breathing was erratic, his heart pounding so hard against his chest that each person in the room could hear it. Every movement forced him to flinch as if he was afraid that he was going to hit. </p><p><br></p><p>Without warning, he quickly rose from his chair and strode out of the room. Everyone quickly parted from his path, afraid of the feral look that encompassed his eyes. He reached his bedroom door faster than he normally did. He couldn\u2019t even remember the last few minutes. Everything seemed to be happening so fast, it was blurry and spinning, it felt like it was in slow motion. </p><p><br></p><p>It made him dizzy. He gripped the door frame tightly, steadying his uneven steps. When he finally made it to the bathroom, he turned the shower on as hot as it could go and he collapsed to the ground. He pulled his knees to his chest and sat. Everything felt numb. He couldn\u2019t believe it, he didn\u2019t want it to be true but he knew it was. </p><p><br></p><p>He stood in the shower until the water ran cold, tears streaming down his face in earnest. Steve pulled himself from the shower, wrapping a towel around himself as he made his way into his bedroom. He moved slowly about the room, barely comprehending the actions he did as he got himself dressed. Once dressed, he grabbed a soft blanket off his bed wrapped it around his shoulders, and collapsed onto the bed. </p><p><br></p><p>He sat for a while, wrapped in his thoughts. He wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d been sitting there, could\u2019ve been minutes. Could\u2019ve been hours. A soft knock on the door pulled his attention away from the spot on the wall he\u2019d been staring at for however long since he\u2019d gotten out of the shower. </p><p><br></p><p>Bucky slowly opened the door and peeked his head in. His eyes were red and puffy, tears lay on his cheeks untouched. There was a stiff silence between the two. It wasn\u2019t one of anger, but one of mutual hurt and pain. This was unbearable for them. It shook the very foundations they had built their modern lives on. </p><p><br></p><p>Steve slowly stood from his place on the bed, a choked sob making it past the large lump that had been forming in his throat. They met in the middle of the room and threw their arms around each other. Tears began to fall from both men again as the reality of the situation slammed into them again. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt was her.\u201d</p><h2><i>If you liked this, let me know!
