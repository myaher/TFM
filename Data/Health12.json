You are a huge inspiration to me and hopefully one day, I\u2019ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p>Just a quick question, what\u2019s the minimum number of hours someone should fast if they just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours and I have heard you mention that its a good fasting duration in one of your podcasts. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n<p><b>2. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/scFqe76QDVs\">Alcohol While Paleo?</a> [</b>4:30]</p>\n<p>Jay says:</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. \u00a0In your opinion, why is this done since according to the WHO alcohol is a known carcinogen sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is \u201cno safe amount\u201d to avoid its\u2019 effects so why is it promoted?</p>\n\n<p><b>3. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/POoZIQrRPEk\">Former Smokers: Can Paleo Reverse Damage?</a></b> [10:02]</p>\n<p>Filipe says:</p>\n<p>Hey Robb</p>\n<p>Thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective (and personal) health. Your teachings left a lasting, highly beneficial imprint on by health and on by wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the U.S. alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much. All the best</p>\n\n<p><b>4. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oJuQjqeGMbs\">Gymnastics Training For Jiu Jitsu?</a></b> [13:17]</p>\n<p>Duey says:</p>\n<p>Hey Robb,</p>\n<p>I\u2019m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings.</p>\n<p>Do you have any free resources for beginners you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu.</p>\n<p>Straight arm strength in particular is tough to come by. Trying to find progressions for those.</p>\n<p>Also, I\u2019m curious as to what you like to do for neck and wrist conditioning. Mine are always creaky from grappling.</p>\n<p>Best</p>\n<p>Duey</p>\n\n<p><b>5. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XztPRdrw4o4\">Oil Roasted Almonds </a></b>[16:36]</p>\n<p>Kathleen says:</p>\n<p>Hi Robb,</p>\n<p>First I wanted to say thank you for all the valuable info you provide. You are one of the few voices I fully trust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new.</p>\n<p>With that, I have heard you say on the podcast that you eat a lot of blue diamond smokehouse almonds (I love those) and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them in favor of the blue diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smokehouse say that they may be roasted in canola or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable/canola oil whenever possible, but I assume the amount of oil you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? If everything is dialed in and you\u2019re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you\u2019d be getting from this? Or have you seen evidence that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your advice!</p>\n<p>Kathleen</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>Where you can find us:</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7XONJSXAV7wrt-Y-myXHg\"><strong><br/></strong></a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robbwolfonline?ref=ts\"><img class=\"wp-image-20833 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dasrobbwolf/\"><img class=\"wp-image-20834 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7XONJSXAV7wrt-Y-myXHg\"><img class=\"wp-image-20835 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"/></a></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/\"><strong><img class=\" wp-image-20836 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"/></strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Submit questions for the podcast: <a href=\"https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/\">https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2>Transcript:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PaleoSolution-427.pdf\"><strong>Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF)</strong></a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Don\u2019t even think about it.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Well hello there.

That\u2019s not a bad way to do it. And then recharge for two years.

She says, \u201cHi Rob, I really appreciate all the work you are doing. You are a huge inspiration, and hopefully one day I\u2019ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people\u2019s lives. Just a quick question, what\u2019s the minimum number of hours someone should fast, if the just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours, and I\u2019ve heard you mention that it\u2019s a good fasting duration in one of your podcast. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. I mean, a concise answer would be yes, that\u2019s a good spot to be. Again, you know, it\u2019s interesting, the fasting topic, we\u2019ve talked a lot about it, I think we\u2019ll talk about it for the next 10 or 20 years, assuming that we\u2019re still in this, doing this stuff. But it\u2019s a really powerful tool, it\u2019s a cool tool. But like any tool, you wanna use it appropriately, and there are definitely scenarios in which more is not better, with regards to fasting. If somebody is exercising a ton, if they\u2019re under a lot of stress, it may, 12 hours may be plenty.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And honestly, some of the research, when you really get in and scrape out the vegan centric dogma, and some of the hyperbole, and everything, 12 hours is a decent spread. If you can compress it a little bit more, that\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s definitely scenarios, like a breastfeeding or a nursing mom, a growing child, a hard training athlete, you know, there are scenarios where 12 hours may be the maximum that we wanna tinker with that stuff.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Everything that we know about, just simply not overeating, and building muscle mass, and all that type of stuff, we know that there\u2019s good benefit there. The extended fasting si speculative at this point, what it means for human health performance, longevity, and </span>whatnot<span style=\"font-size: small;\">. So, certainly get in and tinker, but don\u2019t overly link your wagon to something that we just don\u2019t know that much about yet.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And if you start noticing some adverse effects \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yes.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Then obviously you\u2019re gonna wanna change </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">something.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">That\u2019s the time to pull the rip cord on that. Yeah. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay. Thanks to Raysha, our next question is from Jay, Jay has a good question. Should I consume alcohol while on paleo? Jay says, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health, seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. In your opinion, why is this done? Since according to the World Health Organization, alcohol is a known carcinogen, sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is no safe amount to avoid its effects, so why is it promoted?\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">That\u2019s a really good question. I kind of struggled with this over the course of time, when we were running the gym, the timing, the place, we were earlobe deep in real estate agents. I mean, just droves of them. Really interesting people, very diverse cross section of folks. And within that scene, the way you carry yourself, the way you look, that all ends up playing into how effective you are at what you do, because there\u2019s a huge social component to building the relationship when somebody\u2019s doing the biggest financial decision, often times, of their life.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, we had really good success with these folks, they would lose weight, they would feel better, and they had benefits based around that. But then we also had these folks report, \u201cHey, I\u2019m having some problems because I\u2019m used to sitting down, and wining and dining people, and building that relationship \u2026 \u201c</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Meeting people, networking over \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Meeting people, networking \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Drinks and dinner.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. And there\u2019s just kind of a reality that, I think you\u2019re hard pressed to find very many cultures, there\u2019s a few, that don\u2019t use alcohol as a social lubricant, cohesive element. I would venture to say the bulk of cultures, like alcohol is a feature of the whole story. So, you know, we can get totally wrapped around the axle of, protein, carbs, fat, and circadian biology, and all the stuff. But we always mention the social component, and the community component, we know that an inadequate social connectivity is as negatively impactful on health as a pack a day smoking habit.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, you know, it\u2019s a really interesting question though, you know, so I\u2019m ingesting a known carcinogen, to have a social connectivity that maybe \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Given me joy, and is fun, and makes life \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. And what\u2019s the net win on that? I don\u2019t entirely know. But eve for myself, I honestly am not a huge fan of booze, it\u2019s not my preferred cup of opiates, but it \u2026 There\u2019s also kind of a reality that, I already eat differently than most people. It\u2019s changed a lot over the last 20 years, so it\u2019s easier to find community, easier to find folks that don\u2019t look [inaudible 00:06:34] at me if I order a burger without a bun. It\u2019s just not a </span>big<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> deal now, whereas 15, 20 years ago, you were totally a weirdo doing that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But if we go hang out with friends, of we have a family gathering or something, like having a glass of wine, putting some element into a NorCal margarita, or something, that\u2019s super nice. It\u2019s just kinda nice to unwind and relax with that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, Jay, I don\u2019t know if that super answers your question, but \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I think there\u2019s also a reality that, when you\u2019re trying to get people to start changing their food, and removing a lot of these processed foods, it\u2019s like a baby step sort of thing. SO, if you said, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna eat any grains, no dairy, and no booze.\u201d How many people would even give it a shot? Whereas, if you\u2019re like, you\u2019re gonna cut out the grains, you\u2019re gonna try to eliminate dairy if it \u2026 Or at least see if it gives you problems and then maybe reintroduce \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And on booze \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">On booze, have a glass of red wine, or a NorCal margarita. And then over time, people just start drinking less anyway, because they notice the effects, and how their body feels with the alcohol, how it affects their sleep \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But that step wise story is a really important point, which I kind of neglected. Some people can jump in whole hog, and they just cut everything out, other people do better with a </span>stepwise<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> fashion. For a lot of people, if you suggest booze needs to come out of the rotation, they\u2019re like, \u201cFuck it. I\u2019m done.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I mean, how many people have transformed their health with this ancestral health concept, right? And how many of those wouldn\u2019t have even given it a shot if, in order to do it, it was zero booze?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, I don\u2019t know, Jay, if that fully answers the question of the risk reward story of allowing, or recommending booze. But I think that this is a great example of trying to not make perfection the antagonist of good enough. Like, if we\u2019re getting people off of refined carbohydrates, they\u2019re sleeping better, they\u2019re exercising, they feel better, then to your point, it really is true. If they start feeling better in general, what we find, is that people have a drink, maybe two, and then they\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Because they feel shitty enough from that, that they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m totally good.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, interestingly, it does kind of self regulate on the back end of that, if we get the buy in on the front end with all those other things. But if you\u2019re just living like a cockroach, and you just feel like shit all the time, it\u2019s really hard to de-tangle, is it the crappy carbohydrates? Is it the booze? Is it \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">The lack of sleep.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">The lack of sleep, yeah, because it\u2019s all on top of you. But you start feeling better, and you actually notice the difference when you have booze.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our next question is from Felipe, he says, \u201cPaleo lifestyle is a way of minimizing the occurrence of cancer in former smokers. Hey Rob, thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective and personal health, your teachings left a lasting and highly beneficial imprint on my health, and on my wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the US alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, this is really interesting, and there\u2019s actually a very interesting development of late. Philip Morris, tobacco manufacturer extraordinaire, for a couple of hundred years, I think, they\u2019ve been making tobacco products. They just started offering life insurance for people who quit smoking. There\u2019s all kinds of interesting economic things to be learned from that, but it\u2019s really interesting that the most important thing to do as a smoker, if you wanna minimize your risk of all the associated problems, is to just stop smoking.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Like, if you just stop smoking, the change that occurs on your risk profile is nothing short of amazing. And then beyond that, circadian biology, I would probably put right at the top of the list, get out in the sun early, get that sun on your skin, appropriate vitamin D levels, go to bed early. That circadian biology piece, I could almost make an argument, is more important on the whole cancer story. I may modify that over time.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But people get super focused on food, and the food is important. And again, for the cancer story, just not overeating is a huge factor. And then we start iterating beyond that. This is maybe a scenario though, that we could make a case for a couple of three to five day fasts a year, even for the first couple of years. It\u2019s maybe an argument for a 16/eight eating window, and stuff like that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But again, all of that stuff, I can\u2019t emphasize it enough, it\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s really interesting, it may end up being the bees knees as we move along. But if we know anything for sure, if we sleep better, if we do some exercise, if we get out in the sun, if we lift some weights, if we don\u2019t overeat, then we\u2019re stacking the deck massively in our favor, we know that for a fact. And then some of these other things, if they\u2019re amenable to your lifestyle, sure, drop them in. Little 16/eight fasting, maybe some extended ketosis, maybe a longer fast a couple of times a year.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But those things, I would definitely put in the highly speculative category at this point. Not that they\u2019re not valuable, not that we shouldn\u2019t investigate them, but really make sure that you are buttoned up on the things that we know about first, and then we can start iterating from there.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And I\u2019m stoked that we\u2019ve had influence on what you\u2019ve done. Yeah. I could never get my parents to stop smoking, and that was one of the things that I just begged them to do. So that\u2019s awesome that this has been a part of what\u2019s happened.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our next question is from Duey, on gymnastics and jits. \u201cHey Rob, I\u2019m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings. Do you have any free resources for beginners that you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu. Straight arm strength, in particular, is tough to come by, trying to find progressions for those. Also, I\u2019m curious as to what you do for neck and wrist conditioning, mine are always creaky from grappling.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Tap earlier. So, on the ring strength work, there\u2019s a great book called, Overcoming Gravity, and, huge tome, but really has some slick progressions in it. Very simple. I\u2019ve always like gymnastics bodies. The progressions tend to be a little on the long side, which I think is laudable, because coach Christopher Sommer put a lot of thought into that stuff. But sometimes folks just kinda run aground on that, so I would check out the book, Overcoming Gravity.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And then on the neck and wrist conditioning, Nicki got me into the Kinstretch stuff, in which we do something called \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">If you look up, functional range conditioning, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s tons of YouTube videos on it, but you can learn how to do, what\u2019s called CARs, Controlled Articular Rotations. And they have them for the neck, they have a wrist series as well. So, I mean, that something you should do every single day.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And then, in poking around, you know, classic wrestler bridging, and stuff like that. There\u2019s some information back and forth on whether or not one should do that, if you didn\u2019t develop that skillset as a kid, then maybe it\u2019s not as good. But, you know, doing a basic neck harness in strengthening the neck, inflection, extension, you know, lateral movement. There\u2019s a thing called the iron halo, I believe, something like that, that I\u2019ve been looking at. It\u2019s like 600 bucks though, so it\u2019s kinda pricey, but it looks really good. It sits on your head, and you hook it up to, either a pulley system, or a weights system, and then you can \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, is it like, resisting as you \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">It\u2019s resisting through all these different, you know, ranges of movement. Those things are really helpful. If you have a partner that is willing to help you with things, that can just provide manual resistance with all the different directions, that\u2019s kind of a pain in the ass to do sometimes though, but that\u2019s definitely helpful.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But then on the wrists, in particular, again, kind of back to the gymnastics bodies, or even some of the stuff from, Overcoming Gravity, like there\u2019s the push ups, where you push up onto the wrist, and on the back of the hands. And you can go from kneeling, in which I push up, and then extend up on the kind of backs of the finger tips, and then lower down.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, again, there\u2019s \u2026 If you poke around a little bit, there\u2019s some good wrist conditioning stuff. Just getting, either a weighted \u2026 </span>a<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> pretty good sized hammer, or a bar with, like the, where you can put weights on one side, and doing the rotation, flexion, extension, like there\u2019s all these different movements you can do with that. It\u2019s really valuable, and really effective, but it\u2019s super simple stuff. You just kind of need to get a little bit of a template, or an idea of some of the things to drop in on that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Let\u2019s see. Our last question for this week is from Cathleen, on oil roasted almonds.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\u201cRob, first, I wanna say thank you for all the valuable info you provide. You\u2019re one of the few voices I fully rust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new. With that, I have heard you say that you eat a lot of Blue Diamond smoke housed almonds, and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them, in favor of the Blue Diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smoke housed say </span>that<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> they may be roasted in Canola, or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable and Canola oil wherever possible, but I assume the amount of oil that you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? IF everything is dialed in, and you\u2019re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you\u2019d be getting from this? Or, have you seen that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem? Thanks in advance.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Man, so one thing, I\u2019m not doing so well with the almonds anymore. But I think that that\u2019s more of an oxalate issue, is I\u2019ve kind of poked around on that ironically, they taste so good. But, yeah, I get some kind of gnarly belly from it. Macadamias are kind of the main nut that I do occasionally, and even that I \u2026 Funny enough, I\u2019m eating fewer and fewer vegetable sources, and shifting more and more carnivore, just tinkering with how my gut feels, how my digestion feels. I did like a three week, four week carnivore deal, and I kind of went insane because I just wanted a fucking avocado, and some artichokes, and stuff.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But eating keto, I never had food cravings, and then when I did that, I really went kind of bananas. But it is funny, I\u2019ve been noticing, I\u2019m kind of gravitating more that direction. I seem to do well with fruit, up to a point. So, it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m still tinkering with that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But that\u2019s not really the question, the question is related to, that fats in here. I don\u2019t know that anybody knows what exactly the safe amount is on these seed oils. There\u2019s not a lot that goes into something like these roasted almonds, it\u2019s a very passing amount. If you are deficient in elongated omega 6 Arachidonic acid, and also, EPA/DHA, then these </span>shorter chain<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> polyunsaturated fats are more of an issue with regards to inflammation.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But this is one of the things that, you know, it\u2019s like, people will freak out if they go out to eat and, I don\u2019t know, Chipotle, or something like that. You\u2019re on the road, you\u2019re looking for food, you have no other options, and you go into Chipotle or something, and it\u2019s like, </span>\u201cO<span style=\"font-size: small;\">h, they use Canola oil.</span>\u201d<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> And it\u2019s like, well, either starve, or eat that one meal. And you\u2019re not having refined grains, presumably, you\u2019re not having sugar, you\u2019re not </span>drinking<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> soda, so, is that really the place to freak out about it?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And if you have serious health problems, and you notice that you react to that stuff, then I guess that\u2019s a different story. But I\u2019ve historically not been super freaked out about stuff like that. So, it\u2019s interesting. Would I prefer that they use coconut oil on to, or something? Yeah, probably, but coconut oil has a very specific, distinct flavor, so it\u2019s kind of tough in that regard too. So, yeah, I mean, I historically have not been that freaked out about a lot of vegetable oil here.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I remember when I did \u2026 Posted eating some, not sardines, but the oysters.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Oysters in </span>cottonseed<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> oil.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And they were in </span>cottonseed<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> oil. Fuck, man, people lost their minds. And one, you just don\u2019t get that much, there\u2019s not, you know \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">You weren\u2019t drinking the oil.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah, I don\u2019t drink the oil, you drain it, you can even rinse it a little bit. But these things are \u2026 It\u2019s another thing where people [inaudible 00:19:42] me with all these options for non-cotton seed oil varieties, and that\u2019s great, but the places that we typically shop don\u2019t have those. And it\u2019s just another pain in my ass to, okay, am I gonna order it online, or whatever, and I have them reasonably frequently, but not every single day, so. And again, in the greater mix of life, it\u2019s like, I like them, they taste really good, I think that there\u2019s other healthful benefits to it, and so it\u2019s kind of that cost benefit trade off on that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s fucking killing me, and I\u2019m being an idiot with it, but it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t like obsessing over every </span>Goddamn<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> thing that I put in my mouth. Like, I\u2019m super gluten intolerant, I\u2019m not all that good at handling carbs, so I\u2019m already kind of fucking limited, and it\u2019s just kind like, Jesus Christ, I just wanna </span>eat<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> sometimes, you know. And that is \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Sometimes I\u2019m hesitant to even post what I eat online because again, all the armchair warriors jump in, and everybody\u2019s got a fucking opinion, and they know me better than I know me. But at the same time, what ends up happening when I get in and battle with those dick heads sometimes is that, the people who are watching, I\u2019m learning more and more that it\u2019s not so much about the interaction I\u2019m having with a specific person, it\u2019s everybody else watching.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And they\u2019re watching somebody that, and I\u2019m very grateful for this and I take it very seriously, someone that they respect with regards to how they approach this stuff. And I\u2019m not obsessive, I\u2019m not neurotic, there\u2019s some things that I don\u2019t have a lot of flexibility on. I\u2019m not gonna, on a daily basis, sit down and eat 100 grams of carbs from rice, because it\u2019s gonna fuck me up, and I\u2019m gonna feel terrible, and I\u2019ll probably die from diabetes with it. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna die from a little bit of seed oil in almonds, or tinned fish, or something like that. So, that kind of got off in the weeds, but.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Any other, you have any thoughts on that? I mean, you navigate this stuff pretty well too, just being flexible with what you\u2019re doing, and.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I have nothing to add.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">You have nothing to add. Okay. Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Well, should we thank our show sponsor?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah.

You are a huge inspiration to me and hopefully one day, I\u2019ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p>Just a quick question, what\u2019s the minimum number of hours someone should fast if they just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours and I have heard you mention that its a good fasting duration in one of your podcasts. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n<p><b>2. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/scFqe76QDVs\">Alcohol While Paleo?</a> [</b>4:30]</p>\n<p>Jay says:</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. \u00a0In your opinion, why is this done since according to the WHO alcohol is a known carcinogen sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is \u201cno safe amount\u201d to avoid its\u2019 effects so why is it promoted?</p>\n\n<p><b>3. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/POoZIQrRPEk\">Former Smokers: Can Paleo Reverse Damage?</a></b> [10:02]</p>\n<p>Filipe says:</p>\n<p>Hey Robb</p>\n<p>Thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective (and personal) health. Your teachings left a lasting, highly beneficial imprint on by health and on by wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the U.S. alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much.

Or have you seen evidence that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your advice!</p>\n<p>Kathleen</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>Where you can find us:</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7XONJSXAV7wrt-Y-myXHg\"><strong><br></strong></a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robbwolfonline?ref=ts\"><img class=\"wp-image-20833 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dasrobbwolf/\"><img class=\"wp-image-20834 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7XONJSXAV7wrt-Y-myXHg\"><img class=\"wp-image-20835 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></a></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/\"><strong><img class=\" wp-image-20836 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Submit questions for the podcast: <a href=\"https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/\">https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2>Transcript:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PaleoSolution-427.pdf\"><strong>Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF)</strong></a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Don\u2019t even think about it.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Well hello there.

She says, \u201cHi Rob, I really appreciate all the work you are doing. You are a huge inspiration, and hopefully one day I\u2019ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people\u2019s lives. Just a quick question, what\u2019s the minimum number of hours someone should fast, if the just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours, and I\u2019ve heard you mention that it\u2019s a good fasting duration in one of your podcast. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. I mean, a concise answer would be yes, that\u2019s a good spot to be. Again, you know, it\u2019s interesting, the fasting topic, we\u2019ve talked a lot about it, I think we\u2019ll talk about it for the next 10 or 20 years, assuming that we\u2019re still in this, doing this stuff. But it\u2019s a really powerful tool, it\u2019s a cool tool. But like any tool, you wanna use it appropriately, and there are definitely scenarios in which more is not better, with regards to fasting. If somebody is exercising a ton, if they\u2019re under a lot of stress, it may, 12 hours may be plenty.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And honestly, some of the research, when you really get in and scrape out the vegan centric dogma, and some of the hyperbole, and everything, 12 hours is a decent spread. If you can compress it a little bit more, that\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s definitely scenarios, like a breastfeeding or a nursing mom, a growing child, a hard training athlete, you know, there are scenarios where 12 hours may be the maximum that we wanna tinker with that stuff.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Everything that we know about, just simply not overeating, and building muscle mass, and all that type of stuff, we know that there\u2019s good benefit there. The extended fasting si speculative at this point, what it means for human health performance, longevity, and </span>whatnot<span style=\"font-size: small;\">. So, certainly get in and tinker, but don\u2019t overly link your wagon to something that we just don\u2019t know that much about yet.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And if you start noticing some adverse effects \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yes.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Then obviously you\u2019re gonna wanna change </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">something.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">That\u2019s the time to pull the rip cord on that. Yeah. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay. Thanks to Raysha, our next question is from Jay, Jay has a good question. Should I consume alcohol while on paleo? Jay says, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health, seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. In your opinion, why is this done? Since according to the World Health Organization, alcohol is a known carcinogen, sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is no safe amount to avoid its effects, so why is it promoted?\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">That\u2019s a really good question. I kind of struggled with this over the course of time, when we were running the gym, the timing, the place, we were earlobe deep in real estate agents. I mean, just droves of them. Really interesting people, very diverse cross section of folks. And within that scene, the way you carry yourself, the way you look, that all ends up playing into how effective you are at what you do, because there\u2019s a huge social component to building the relationship when somebody\u2019s doing the biggest financial decision, often times, of their life.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, we had really good success with these folks, they would lose weight, they would feel better, and they had benefits based around that. But then we also had these folks report, \u201cHey, I\u2019m having some problems because I\u2019m used to sitting down, and wining and dining people, and building that relationship \u2026 \u201c</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Meeting people, networking over \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Meeting people, networking \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Drinks and dinner.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. And there\u2019s just kind of a reality that, I think you\u2019re hard pressed to find very many cultures, there\u2019s a few, that don\u2019t use alcohol as a social lubricant, cohesive element. I would venture to say the bulk of cultures, like alcohol is a feature of the whole story. So, you know, we can get totally wrapped around the axle of, protein, carbs, fat, and circadian biology, and all the stuff. But we always mention the social component, and the community component, we know that an inadequate social connectivity is as negatively impactful on health as a pack a day smoking habit.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, you know, it\u2019s a really interesting question though, you know, so I\u2019m ingesting a known carcinogen, to have a social connectivity that maybe \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Given me joy, and is fun, and makes life \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. And what\u2019s the net win on that? I don\u2019t entirely know. But eve for myself, I honestly am not a huge fan of booze, it\u2019s not my preferred cup of opiates, but it \u2026 There\u2019s also kind of a reality that, I already eat differently than most people. It\u2019s changed a lot over the last 20 years, so it\u2019s easier to find community, easier to find folks that don\u2019t look [inaudible 00:06:34] at me if I order a burger without a bun. It\u2019s just not a </span>big<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> deal now, whereas 15, 20 years ago, you were totally a weirdo doing that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But if we go hang out with friends, of we have a family gathering or something, like having a glass of wine, putting some element into a NorCal margarita, or something, that\u2019s super nice. It\u2019s just kinda nice to unwind and relax with that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, Jay, I don\u2019t know if that super answers your question, but \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I think there\u2019s also a reality that, when you\u2019re trying to get people to start changing their food, and removing a lot of these processed foods, it\u2019s like a baby step sort of thing. SO, if you said, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna eat any grains, no dairy, and no booze.\u201d How many people would even give it a shot? Whereas, if you\u2019re like, you\u2019re gonna cut out the grains, you\u2019re gonna try to eliminate dairy if it \u2026 Or at least see if it gives you problems and then maybe reintroduce \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And on booze \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">On booze, have a glass of red wine, or a NorCal margarita. And then over time, people just start drinking less anyway, because they notice the effects, and how their body feels with the alcohol, how it affects their sleep \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But that step wise story is a really important point, which I kind of neglected. Some people can jump in whole hog, and they just cut everything out, other people do better with a </span>stepwise<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> fashion. For a lot of people, if you suggest booze needs to come out of the rotation, they\u2019re like, \u201cFuck it. I\u2019m done.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I mean, how many people have transformed their health with this ancestral health concept, right? And how many of those wouldn\u2019t have even given it a shot if, in order to do it, it was zero booze?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, I don\u2019t know, Jay, if that fully answers the question of the risk reward story of allowing, or recommending booze. But I think that this is a great example of trying to not make perfection the antagonist of good enough. Like, if we\u2019re getting people off of refined carbohydrates, they\u2019re sleeping better, they\u2019re exercising, they feel better, then to your point, it really is true. If they start feeling better in general, what we find, is that people have a drink, maybe two, and then they\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Because they feel shitty enough from that, that they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m totally good.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, interestingly, it does kind of self regulate on the back end of that, if we get the buy in on the front end with all those other things. But if you\u2019re just living like a cockroach, and you just feel like shit all the time, it\u2019s really hard to de-tangle, is it the crappy carbohydrates? Is it the booze? Is it \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">The lack of sleep.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">The lack of sleep, yeah, because it\u2019s all on top of you. But you start feeling better, and you actually notice the difference when you have booze.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our next question is from Felipe, he says, \u201cPaleo lifestyle is a way of minimizing the occurrence of cancer in former smokers. Hey Rob, thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective and personal health, your teachings left a lasting and highly beneficial imprint on my health, and on my wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the US alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, this is really interesting, and there\u2019s actually a very interesting development of late. Philip Morris, tobacco manufacturer extraordinaire, for a couple of hundred years, I think, they\u2019ve been making tobacco products. They just started offering life insurance for people who quit smoking. There\u2019s all kinds of interesting economic things to be learned from that, but it\u2019s really interesting that the most important thing to do as a smoker, if you wanna minimize your risk of all the associated problems, is to just stop smoking.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Like, if you just stop smoking, the change that occurs on your risk profile is nothing short of amazing. And then beyond that, circadian biology, I would probably put right at the top of the list, get out in the sun early, get that sun on your skin, appropriate vitamin D levels, go to bed early. That circadian biology piece, I could almost make an argument, is more important on the whole cancer story. I may modify that over time.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But people get super focused on food, and the food is important. And again, for the cancer story, just not overeating is a huge factor. And then we start iterating beyond that. This is maybe a scenario though, that we could make a case for a couple of three to five day fasts a year, even for the first couple of years. It\u2019s maybe an argument for a 16/eight eating window, and stuff like that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But again, all of that stuff, I can\u2019t emphasize it enough, it\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s really interesting, it may end up being the bees knees as we move along. But if we know anything for sure, if we sleep better, if we do some exercise, if we get out in the sun, if we lift some weights, if we don\u2019t overeat, then we\u2019re stacking the deck massively in our favor, we know that for a fact. And then some of these other things, if they\u2019re amenable to your lifestyle, sure, drop them in. Little 16/eight fasting, maybe some extended ketosis, maybe a longer fast a couple of times a year.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But those things, I would definitely put in the highly speculative category at this point. Not that they\u2019re not valuable, not that we shouldn\u2019t investigate them, but really make sure that you are buttoned up on the things that we know about first, and then we can start iterating from there.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And I\u2019m stoked that we\u2019ve had influence on what you\u2019ve done. Yeah. I could never get my parents to stop smoking, and that was one of the things that I just begged them to do. So that\u2019s awesome that this has been a part of what\u2019s happened.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our next question is from Duey, on gymnastics and jits. \u201cHey Rob, I\u2019m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings. Do you have any free resources for beginners that you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu. Straight arm strength, in particular, is tough to come by, trying to find progressions for those. Also, I\u2019m curious as to what you do for neck and wrist conditioning, mine are always creaky from grappling.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Tap earlier. So, on the ring strength work, there\u2019s a great book called, Overcoming Gravity, and, huge tome, but really has some slick progressions in it. Very simple. I\u2019ve always like gymnastics bodies. The progressions tend to be a little on the long side, which I think is laudable, because coach Christopher Sommer put a lot of thought into that stuff. But sometimes folks just kinda run aground on that, so I would check out the book, Overcoming Gravity.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And then on the neck and wrist conditioning, Nicki got me into the Kinstretch stuff, in which we do something called \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">If you look up, functional range conditioning, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s tons of YouTube videos on it, but you can learn how to do, what\u2019s called CARs, Controlled Articular Rotations. And they have them for the neck, they have a wrist series as well. So, I mean, that something you should do every single day.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And then, in poking around, you know, classic wrestler bridging, and stuff like that. There\u2019s some information back and forth on whether or not one should do that, if you didn\u2019t develop that skillset as a kid, then maybe it\u2019s not as good. But, you know, doing a basic neck harness in strengthening the neck, inflection, extension, you know, lateral movement. There\u2019s a thing called the iron halo, I believe, something like that, that I\u2019ve been looking at. It\u2019s like 600 bucks though, so it\u2019s kinda pricey, but it looks really good. It sits on your head, and you hook it up to, either a pulley system, or a weights system, and then you can \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, is it like, resisting as you \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">It\u2019s resisting through all these different, you know, ranges of movement. Those things are really helpful. If you have a partner that is willing to help you with things, that can just provide manual resistance with all the different directions, that\u2019s kind of a pain in the ass to do sometimes though, but that\u2019s definitely helpful.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But then on the wrists, in particular, again, kind of back to the gymnastics bodies, or even some of the stuff from, Overcoming Gravity, like there\u2019s the push ups, where you push up onto the wrist, and on the back of the hands. And you can go from kneeling, in which I push up, and then extend up on the kind of backs of the finger tips, and then lower down.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, again, there\u2019s \u2026 If you poke around a little bit, there\u2019s some good wrist conditioning stuff. Just getting, either a weighted \u2026 </span>a<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> pretty good sized hammer, or a bar with, like the, where you can put weights on one side, and doing the rotation, flexion, extension, like there\u2019s all these different movements you can do with that. It\u2019s really valuable, and really effective, but it\u2019s super simple stuff. You just kind of need to get a little bit of a template, or an idea of some of the things to drop in on that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Let\u2019s see. Our last question for this week is from Cathleen, on oil roasted almonds.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\u201cRob, first, I wanna say thank you for all the valuable info you provide. You\u2019re one of the few voices I fully rust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new. With that, I have heard you say that you eat a lot of Blue Diamond smoke housed almonds, and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them, in favor of the Blue Diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smoke housed say </span>that<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> they may be roasted in Canola, or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable and Canola oil wherever possible, but I assume the amount of oil that you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? IF everything is dialed in, and you\u2019re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you\u2019d be getting from this? Or, have you seen that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem? Thanks in advance.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Man, so one thing, I\u2019m not doing so well with the almonds anymore. But I think that that\u2019s more of an oxalate issue, is I\u2019ve kind of poked around on that ironically, they taste so good. But, yeah, I get some kind of gnarly belly from it. Macadamias are kind of the main nut that I do occasionally, and even that I \u2026 Funny enough, I\u2019m eating fewer and fewer vegetable sources, and shifting more and more carnivore, just tinkering with how my gut feels, how my digestion feels. I did like a three week, four week carnivore deal, and I kind of went insane because I just wanted a fucking avocado, and some artichokes, and stuff.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But eating keto, I never had food cravings, and then when I did that, I really went kind of bananas. But it is funny, I\u2019ve been noticing, I\u2019m kind of gravitating more that direction. I seem to do well with fruit, up to a point. So, it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m still tinkering with that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But that\u2019s not really the question, the question is related to, that fats in here. I don\u2019t know that anybody knows what exactly the safe amount is on these seed oils. There\u2019s not a lot that goes into something like these roasted almonds, it\u2019s a very passing amount. If you are deficient in elongated omega 6 Arachidonic acid, and also, EPA/DHA, then these </span>shorter chain<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> polyunsaturated fats are more of an issue with regards to inflammation.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But this is one of the things that, you know, it\u2019s like, people will freak out if they go out to eat and, I don\u2019t know, Chipotle, or something like that. You\u2019re on the road, you\u2019re looking for food, you have no other options, and you go into Chipotle or something, and it\u2019s like, </span>\u201cO<span style=\"font-size: small;\">h, they use Canola oil.</span>\u201d<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> And it\u2019s like, well, either starve, or eat that one meal. And you\u2019re not having refined grains, presumably, you\u2019re not having sugar, you\u2019re not </span>drinking<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> soda, so, is that really the place to freak out about it?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And if you have serious health problems, and you notice that you react to that stuff, then I guess that\u2019s a different story. But I\u2019ve historically not been super freaked out about stuff like that. So, it\u2019s interesting. Would I prefer that they use coconut oil on to, or something? Yeah, probably, but coconut oil has a very specific, distinct flavor, so it\u2019s kind of tough in that regard too. So, yeah, I mean, I historically have not been that freaked out about a lot of vegetable oil here.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I remember when I did \u2026 Posted eating some, not sardines, but the oysters.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Oysters in </span>cottonseed<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> oil.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And they were in </span>cottonseed<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> oil. Fuck, man, people lost their minds. And one, you just don\u2019t get that much, there\u2019s not, you know \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">You weren\u2019t drinking the oil.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah, I don\u2019t drink the oil, you drain it, you can even rinse it a little bit. But these things are \u2026 It\u2019s another thing where people [inaudible 00:19:42] me with all these options for non-cotton seed oil varieties, and that\u2019s great, but the places that we typically shop don\u2019t have those. And it\u2019s just another pain in my ass to, okay, am I gonna order it online, or whatever, and I have them reasonably frequently, but not every single day, so. And again, in the greater mix of life, it\u2019s like, I like them, they taste really good, I think that there\u2019s other healthful benefits to it, and so it\u2019s kind of that cost benefit trade off on that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s fucking killing me, and I\u2019m being an idiot with it, but it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t like obsessing over every </span>Goddamn<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> thing that I put in my mouth. Like, I\u2019m super gluten intolerant, I\u2019m not all that good at handling carbs, so I\u2019m already kind of fucking limited, and it\u2019s just kind like, Jesus Christ, I just wanna </span>eat<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> sometimes, you know. And that is \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Sometimes I\u2019m hesitant to even post what I eat online because again, all the armchair warriors jump in, and everybody\u2019s got a fucking opinion, and they know me better than I know me. But at the same time, what ends up happening when I get in and battle with those dick heads sometimes is that, the people who are watching, I\u2019m learning more and more that it\u2019s not so much about the interaction I\u2019m having with a specific person, it\u2019s everybody else watching.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And they\u2019re watching somebody that, and I\u2019m very grateful for this and I take it very seriously, someone that they respect with regards to how they approach this stuff. And I\u2019m not obsessive, I\u2019m not neurotic, there\u2019s some things that I don\u2019t have a lot of flexibility on. I\u2019m not gonna, on a daily basis, sit down and eat 100 grams of carbs from rice, because it\u2019s gonna fuck me up, and I\u2019m gonna feel terrible, and I\u2019ll probably die from diabetes with it. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna die from a little bit of seed oil in almonds, or tinned fish, or something like that. So, that kind of got off in the weeds, but.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Any other, you have any thoughts on that? I mean, you navigate this stuff pretty well too, just being flexible with what you\u2019re doing, and.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I have nothing to add.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">You have nothing to add. Okay. Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Well, should we thank our show sponsor?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah.

You are a huge inspiration to me and hopefully one day, I\u2019ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p>Just a quick question, what\u2019s the minimum number of hours someone should fast if they just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours and I have heard you mention that its a good fasting duration in one of your podcasts. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n<p><b>2. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/scFqe76QDVs\">Alcohol While Paleo?</a> [</b>4:30]</p>\n<p>Jay says:</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. \u00a0In your opinion, why is this done since according to the WHO alcohol is a known carcinogen sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is \u201cno safe amount\u201d to avoid its\u2019 effects so why is it promoted?</p>\n\n<p><b>3. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/POoZIQrRPEk\">Former Smokers: Can Paleo Reverse Damage?</a></b> [10:02]</p>\n<p>Filipe says:</p>\n<p>Hey Robb</p>\n<p>Thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective (and personal) health. Your teachings left a lasting, highly beneficial imprint on by health and on by wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer?

You are one of the few voices I fully trust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new.</p>\n<p>With that, I have heard you say on the podcast that you eat a lot of blue diamond smokehouse almonds (I love those) and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them in favor of the blue diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smokehouse say that they may be roasted in canola or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable/canola oil whenever possible, but I assume the amount of oil you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? If everything is dialed in and you\u2019re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you\u2019d be getting from this? Or have you seen evidence that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your advice!</p>\n<p>Kathleen</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4><strong>Where you can find us:</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7XONJSXAV7wrt-Y-myXHg\"><strong><br></strong></a></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robbwolfonline?ref=ts\"><img class=\"wp-image-20833 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-facebook-4-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dasrobbwolf/\"><img class=\"wp-image-20834 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-instagram-14-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7XONJSXAV7wrt-Y-myXHg\"><img class=\"wp-image-20835 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-youtube-9-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></a></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/\"><strong><img class=\" wp-image-20836 alignleft\" src=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"55\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240.png 240w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240-165x165.png 165w, https://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iconmonstr-email-10-240-235x235.png 235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 55px) 100vw, 55px\"></strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Submit questions for the podcast: <a href=\"https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/\">https://robbwolf.com/contact/submit-a-question-for-the-podcast/</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2>Transcript:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PaleoSolution-427.pdf\"><strong>Download a copy of the transcript here (PDF)</strong></a></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Don\u2019t even think about it.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Well hello there.

She says, \u201cHi Rob, I really appreciate all the work you are doing. You are a huge inspiration, and hopefully one day I\u2019ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people\u2019s lives. Just a quick question, what\u2019s the minimum number of hours someone should fast, if the just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours, and I\u2019ve heard you mention that it\u2019s a good fasting duration in one of your podcast. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. I mean, a concise answer would be yes, that\u2019s a good spot to be. Again, you know, it\u2019s interesting, the fasting topic, we\u2019ve talked a lot about it, I think we\u2019ll talk about it for the next 10 or 20 years, assuming that we\u2019re still in this, doing this stuff. But it\u2019s a really powerful tool, it\u2019s a cool tool. But like any tool, you wanna use it appropriately, and there are definitely scenarios in which more is not better, with regards to fasting. If somebody is exercising a ton, if they\u2019re under a lot of stress, it may, 12 hours may be plenty.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And honestly, some of the research, when you really get in and scrape out the vegan centric dogma, and some of the hyperbole, and everything, 12 hours is a decent spread. If you can compress it a little bit more, that\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s definitely scenarios, like a breastfeeding or a nursing mom, a growing child, a hard training athlete, you know, there are scenarios where 12 hours may be the maximum that we wanna tinker with that stuff.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Everything that we know about, just simply not overeating, and building muscle mass, and all that type of stuff, we know that there\u2019s good benefit there. The extended fasting si speculative at this point, what it means for human health performance, longevity, and </span>whatnot<span style=\"font-size: small;\">. So, certainly get in and tinker, but don\u2019t overly link your wagon to something that we just don\u2019t know that much about yet.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And if you start noticing some adverse effects \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yes.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Then obviously you\u2019re gonna wanna change </span><span style=\"font-size: small;\">something.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">That\u2019s the time to pull the rip cord on that. Yeah. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay. Thanks to Raysha, our next question is from Jay, Jay has a good question. Should I consume alcohol while on paleo? Jay says, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health, seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. In your opinion, why is this done? Since according to the World Health Organization, alcohol is a known carcinogen, sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is no safe amount to avoid its effects, so why is it promoted?\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">That\u2019s a really good question. I kind of struggled with this over the course of time, when we were running the gym, the timing, the place, we were earlobe deep in real estate agents. I mean, just droves of them. Really interesting people, very diverse cross section of folks. And within that scene, the way you carry yourself, the way you look, that all ends up playing into how effective you are at what you do, because there\u2019s a huge social component to building the relationship when somebody\u2019s doing the biggest financial decision, often times, of their life.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, we had really good success with these folks, they would lose weight, they would feel better, and they had benefits based around that. But then we also had these folks report, \u201cHey, I\u2019m having some problems because I\u2019m used to sitting down, and wining and dining people, and building that relationship \u2026 \u201c</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Meeting people, networking over \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Meeting people, networking \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Drinks and dinner.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. And there\u2019s just kind of a reality that, I think you\u2019re hard pressed to find very many cultures, there\u2019s a few, that don\u2019t use alcohol as a social lubricant, cohesive element. I would venture to say the bulk of cultures, like alcohol is a feature of the whole story. So, you know, we can get totally wrapped around the axle of, protein, carbs, fat, and circadian biology, and all the stuff. But we always mention the social component, and the community component, we know that an inadequate social connectivity is as negatively impactful on health as a pack a day smoking habit.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, you know, it\u2019s a really interesting question though, you know, so I\u2019m ingesting a known carcinogen, to have a social connectivity that maybe \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Given me joy, and is fun, and makes life \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. And what\u2019s the net win on that? I don\u2019t entirely know. But eve for myself, I honestly am not a huge fan of booze, it\u2019s not my preferred cup of opiates, but it \u2026 There\u2019s also kind of a reality that, I already eat differently than most people. It\u2019s changed a lot over the last 20 years, so it\u2019s easier to find community, easier to find folks that don\u2019t look [inaudible 00:06:34] at me if I order a burger without a bun. It\u2019s just not a </span>big<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> deal now, whereas 15, 20 years ago, you were totally a weirdo doing that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But if we go hang out with friends, of we have a family gathering or something, like having a glass of wine, putting some element into a NorCal margarita, or something, that\u2019s super nice. It\u2019s just kinda nice to unwind and relax with that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, Jay, I don\u2019t know if that super answers your question, but \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I think there\u2019s also a reality that, when you\u2019re trying to get people to start changing their food, and removing a lot of these processed foods, it\u2019s like a baby step sort of thing. SO, if you said, \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna eat any grains, no dairy, and no booze.\u201d How many people would even give it a shot? Whereas, if you\u2019re like, you\u2019re gonna cut out the grains, you\u2019re gonna try to eliminate dairy if it \u2026 Or at least see if it gives you problems and then maybe reintroduce \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And on booze \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">On booze, have a glass of red wine, or a NorCal margarita. And then over time, people just start drinking less anyway, because they notice the effects, and how their body feels with the alcohol, how it affects their sleep \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But that step wise story is a really important point, which I kind of neglected. Some people can jump in whole hog, and they just cut everything out, other people do better with a </span>stepwise<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> fashion. For a lot of people, if you suggest booze needs to come out of the rotation, they\u2019re like, \u201cFuck it. I\u2019m done.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I mean, how many people have transformed their health with this ancestral health concept, right? And how many of those wouldn\u2019t have even given it a shot if, in order to do it, it was zero booze?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, I don\u2019t know, Jay, if that fully answers the question of the risk reward story of allowing, or recommending booze. But I think that this is a great example of trying to not make perfection the antagonist of good enough. Like, if we\u2019re getting people off of refined carbohydrates, they\u2019re sleeping better, they\u2019re exercising, they feel better, then to your point, it really is true. If they start feeling better in general, what we find, is that people have a drink, maybe two, and then they\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Because they feel shitty enough from that, that they\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m totally good.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, interestingly, it does kind of self regulate on the back end of that, if we get the buy in on the front end with all those other things. But if you\u2019re just living like a cockroach, and you just feel like shit all the time, it\u2019s really hard to de-tangle, is it the crappy carbohydrates? Is it the booze? Is it \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">The lack of sleep.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">The lack of sleep, yeah, because it\u2019s all on top of you. But you start feeling better, and you actually notice the difference when you have booze.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our next question is from Felipe, he says, \u201cPaleo lifestyle is a way of minimizing the occurrence of cancer in former smokers. Hey Rob, thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective and personal health, your teachings left a lasting and highly beneficial imprint on my health, and on my wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the US alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, this is really interesting, and there\u2019s actually a very interesting development of late. Philip Morris, tobacco manufacturer extraordinaire, for a couple of hundred years, I think, they\u2019ve been making tobacco products. They just started offering life insurance for people who quit smoking. There\u2019s all kinds of interesting economic things to be learned from that, but it\u2019s really interesting that the most important thing to do as a smoker, if you wanna minimize your risk of all the associated problems, is to just stop smoking.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Like, if you just stop smoking, the change that occurs on your risk profile is nothing short of amazing. And then beyond that, circadian biology, I would probably put right at the top of the list, get out in the sun early, get that sun on your skin, appropriate vitamin D levels, go to bed early. That circadian biology piece, I could almost make an argument, is more important on the whole cancer story. I may modify that over time.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But people get super focused on food, and the food is important. And again, for the cancer story, just not overeating is a huge factor. And then we start iterating beyond that. This is maybe a scenario though, that we could make a case for a couple of three to five day fasts a year, even for the first couple of years. It\u2019s maybe an argument for a 16/eight eating window, and stuff like that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But again, all of that stuff, I can\u2019t emphasize it enough, it\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s really interesting, it may end up being the bees knees as we move along. But if we know anything for sure, if we sleep better, if we do some exercise, if we get out in the sun, if we lift some weights, if we don\u2019t overeat, then we\u2019re stacking the deck massively in our favor, we know that for a fact. And then some of these other things, if they\u2019re amenable to your lifestyle, sure, drop them in. Little 16/eight fasting, maybe some extended ketosis, maybe a longer fast a couple of times a year.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But those things, I would definitely put in the highly speculative category at this point. Not that they\u2019re not valuable, not that we shouldn\u2019t investigate them, but really make sure that you are buttoned up on the things that we know about first, and then we can start iterating from there.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And I\u2019m stoked that we\u2019ve had influence on what you\u2019ve done. Yeah. I could never get my parents to stop smoking, and that was one of the things that I just begged them to do. So that\u2019s awesome that this has been a part of what\u2019s happened.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Our next question is from Duey, on gymnastics and jits. \u201cHey Rob, I\u2019m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings. Do you have any free resources for beginners that you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu. Straight arm strength, in particular, is tough to come by, trying to find progressions for those. Also, I\u2019m curious as to what you do for neck and wrist conditioning, mine are always creaky from grappling.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Tap earlier. So, on the ring strength work, there\u2019s a great book called, Overcoming Gravity, and, huge tome, but really has some slick progressions in it. Very simple. I\u2019ve always like gymnastics bodies. The progressions tend to be a little on the long side, which I think is laudable, because coach Christopher Sommer put a lot of thought into that stuff. But sometimes folks just kinda run aground on that, so I would check out the book, Overcoming Gravity.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And then on the neck and wrist conditioning, Nicki got me into the Kinstretch stuff, in which we do something called \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">If you look up, functional range conditioning, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s tons of YouTube videos on it, but you can learn how to do, what\u2019s called CARs, Controlled Articular Rotations. And they have them for the neck, they have a wrist series as well. So, I mean, that something you should do every single day.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah. Yeah.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And then, in poking around, you know, classic wrestler bridging, and stuff like that. There\u2019s some information back and forth on whether or not one should do that, if you didn\u2019t develop that skillset as a kid, then maybe it\u2019s not as good. But, you know, doing a basic neck harness in strengthening the neck, inflection, extension, you know, lateral movement. There\u2019s a thing called the iron halo, I believe, something like that, that I\u2019ve been looking at. It\u2019s like 600 bucks though, so it\u2019s kinda pricey, but it looks really good. It sits on your head, and you hook it up to, either a pulley system, or a weights system, and then you can \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, is it like, resisting as you \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">It\u2019s resisting through all these different, you know, ranges of movement. Those things are really helpful. If you have a partner that is willing to help you with things, that can just provide manual resistance with all the different directions, that\u2019s kind of a pain in the ass to do sometimes though, but that\u2019s definitely helpful.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But then on the wrists, in particular, again, kind of back to the gymnastics bodies, or even some of the stuff from, Overcoming Gravity, like there\u2019s the push ups, where you push up onto the wrist, and on the back of the hands. And you can go from kneeling, in which I push up, and then extend up on the kind of backs of the finger tips, and then lower down.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">So, again, there\u2019s \u2026 If you poke around a little bit, there\u2019s some good wrist conditioning stuff. Just getting, either a weighted \u2026 </span>a<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> pretty good sized hammer, or a bar with, like the, where you can put weights on one side, and doing the rotation, flexion, extension, like there\u2019s all these different movements you can do with that. It\u2019s really valuable, and really effective, but it\u2019s super simple stuff. You just kind of need to get a little bit of a template, or an idea of some of the things to drop in on that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Let\u2019s see. Our last question for this week is from Cathleen, on oil roasted almonds.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\u201cRob, first, I wanna say thank you for all the valuable info you provide. You\u2019re one of the few voices I fully rust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new. With that, I have heard you say that you eat a lot of Blue Diamond smoke housed almonds, and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them, in favor of the Blue Diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smoke housed say </span>that<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> they may be roasted in Canola, or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable and Canola oil wherever possible, but I assume the amount of oil that you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? IF everything is dialed in, and you\u2019re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you\u2019d be getting from this? Or, have you seen that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem? Thanks in advance.\u201d</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Man, so one thing, I\u2019m not doing so well with the almonds anymore. But I think that that\u2019s more of an oxalate issue, is I\u2019ve kind of poked around on that ironically, they taste so good. But, yeah, I get some kind of gnarly belly from it. Macadamias are kind of the main nut that I do occasionally, and even that I \u2026 Funny enough, I\u2019m eating fewer and fewer vegetable sources, and shifting more and more carnivore, just tinkering with how my gut feels, how my digestion feels. I did like a three week, four week carnivore deal, and I kind of went insane because I just wanted a fucking avocado, and some artichokes, and stuff.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But eating keto, I never had food cravings, and then when I did that, I really went kind of bananas. But it is funny, I\u2019ve been noticing, I\u2019m kind of gravitating more that direction. I seem to do well with fruit, up to a point. So, it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m still tinkering with that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But that\u2019s not really the question, the question is related to, that fats in here. I don\u2019t know that anybody knows what exactly the safe amount is on these seed oils. There\u2019s not a lot that goes into something like these roasted almonds, it\u2019s a very passing amount. If you are deficient in elongated omega 6 Arachidonic acid, and also, EPA/DHA, then these </span>shorter chain<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> polyunsaturated fats are more of an issue with regards to inflammation.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">But this is one of the things that, you know, it\u2019s like, people will freak out if they go out to eat and, I don\u2019t know, Chipotle, or something like that. You\u2019re on the road, you\u2019re looking for food, you have no other options, and you go into Chipotle or something, and it\u2019s like, </span>\u201cO<span style=\"font-size: small;\">h, they use Canola oil.</span>\u201d<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> And it\u2019s like, well, either starve, or eat that one meal. And you\u2019re not having refined grains, presumably, you\u2019re not having sugar, you\u2019re not </span>drinking<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> soda, so, is that really the place to freak out about it?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And if you have serious health problems, and you notice that you react to that stuff, then I guess that\u2019s a different story. But I\u2019ve historically not been super freaked out about stuff like that. So, it\u2019s interesting. Would I prefer that they use coconut oil on to, or something? Yeah, probably, but coconut oil has a very specific, distinct flavor, so it\u2019s kind of tough in that regard too. So, yeah, I mean, I historically have not been that freaked out about a lot of vegetable oil here.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I remember when I did \u2026 Posted eating some, not sardines, but the oysters.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Oysters in </span>cottonseed<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> oil.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And they were in </span>cottonseed<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> oil. Fuck, man, people lost their minds. And one, you just don\u2019t get that much, there\u2019s not, you know \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">You weren\u2019t drinking the oil.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah, I don\u2019t drink the oil, you drain it, you can even rinse it a little bit. But these things are \u2026 It\u2019s another thing where people [inaudible 00:19:42] me with all these options for non-cotton seed oil varieties, and that\u2019s great, but the places that we typically shop don\u2019t have those. And it\u2019s just another pain in my ass to, okay, am I gonna order it online, or whatever, and I have them reasonably frequently, but not every single day, so. And again, in the greater mix of life, it\u2019s like, I like them, they taste really good, I think that there\u2019s other healthful benefits to it, and so it\u2019s kind of that cost benefit trade off on that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s fucking killing me, and I\u2019m being an idiot with it, but it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t like obsessing over every </span>Goddamn<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> thing that I put in my mouth. Like, I\u2019m super gluten intolerant, I\u2019m not all that good at handling carbs, so I\u2019m already kind of fucking limited, and it\u2019s just kind like, Jesus Christ, I just wanna </span>eat<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> sometimes, you know. And that is \u2026</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Sometimes I\u2019m hesitant to even post what I eat online because again, all the armchair warriors jump in, and everybody\u2019s got a fucking opinion, and they know me better than I know me. But at the same time, what ends up happening when I get in and battle with those dick heads sometimes is that, the people who are watching, I\u2019m learning more and more that it\u2019s not so much about the interaction I\u2019m having with a specific person, it\u2019s everybody else watching.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">And they\u2019re watching somebody that, and I\u2019m very grateful for this and I take it very seriously, someone that they respect with regards to how they approach this stuff. And I\u2019m not obsessive, I\u2019m not neurotic, there\u2019s some things that I don\u2019t have a lot of flexibility on. I\u2019m not gonna, on a daily basis, sit down and eat 100 grams of carbs from rice, because it\u2019s gonna fuck me up, and I\u2019m gonna feel terrible, and I\u2019ll probably die from diabetes with it. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna die from a little bit of seed oil in almonds, or tinned fish, or something like that. So, that kind of got off in the weeds, but.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Any other, you have any thoughts on that? I mean, you navigate this stuff pretty well too, just being flexible with what you\u2019re doing, and.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">I have nothing to add.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">You have nothing to add. Okay. Okay.</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Robb:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Well, should we thank our show sponsor?</span></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b>Nicki:</b></span> <span style=\"font-size: small;\">Yeah.

You are a huge inspiration to me and hopefully one day, I&rsquo;ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>\n<p>Just a quick question, what&rsquo;s the minimum number of hours someone should fast if they just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours and I have heard you mention that its a good fasting duration in one of your podcasts. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n<p><b>2. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/scFqe76QDVs\">Alcohol While Paleo?</a> [</b>4:30]</p>\n<p>Jay says:</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. &nbsp;In your opinion, why is this done since according to the WHO alcohol is a known carcinogen sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is &ldquo;no safe amount&rdquo; to avoid its&rsquo; effects so why is it promoted?</p>\n\n<p><b>3. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/POoZIQrRPEk\">Former Smokers: Can Paleo Reverse Damage?</a></b> [10:02]</p>\n<p>Filipe says:</p>\n<p>Hey Robb</p>\n<p>Thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective (and personal) health. Your teachings left a lasting, highly beneficial imprint on by health and on by wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the U.S. alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much. All the best</p>\n\n<p><b>4. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oJuQjqeGMbs\">Gymnastics Training For Jiu Jitsu?</a></b> [13:17]</p>\n<p>Duey says:</p>\n<p>Hey Robb,</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings.</p>\n<p>Do you have any free resources for beginners you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu.</p>\n<p>Straight arm strength in particular is tough to come by.

Yeah.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Yeah.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> So, should we jump into this week&rsquo;s first question?</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Sure.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Okay.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Let&rsquo;s see, we have a question from Raysha , on the minimum hours for fasting. She says, &ldquo;Hi Rob, I really appreciate all the work you are doing. You are a huge inspiration, and hopefully one day I&rsquo;ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people&rsquo;s lives. Just a quick question, what&rsquo;s the minimum number of hours someone should fast, if the just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours, and I&rsquo;ve heard you mention that it&rsquo;s a good fasting duration in one of your podcast. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Yeah. I mean, a concise answer would be yes, that&rsquo;s a good spot to be. Again, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting, the fasting topic, we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about it, I think we&rsquo;ll talk about it for the next 10 or 20 years, assuming that we&rsquo;re still in this, doing this stuff. But it&rsquo;s a really powerful tool, it&rsquo;s a cool tool. But like any tool, you wanna use it appropriately, and there are definitely scenarios in which more is not better, with regards to fasting. If somebody is exercising a ton, if they&rsquo;re under a lot of stress, it may, 12 hours may be plenty.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And honestly, some of the research, when you really get in and scrape out the vegan centric dogma, and some of the hyperbole, and everything, 12 hours is a decent spread. If you can compress it a little bit more, that&rsquo;s fine, but there&rsquo;s definitely scenarios, like a breastfeeding or a nursing mom, a growing child, a hard training athlete, you know, there are scenarios where 12 hours may be the maximum that we wanna tinker with that stuff.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Everything that we know about, just simply not overeating, and building muscle mass, and all that type of stuff, we know that there&rsquo;s good benefit there. The extended fasting si speculative at this point, what it means for human health performance, longevity, and whatnot. So, certainly get in and tinker, but don&rsquo;t overly link your wagon to something that we just don&rsquo;t know that much about yet.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> And if you start noticing some adverse effects &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Yes.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Then obviously you&rsquo;re gonna wanna change something.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> That&rsquo;s the time to pull the rip cord on that. Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Okay. Thanks to Raysha, our next question is from Jay, Jay has a good question. Should I consume alcohol while on paleo? Jay says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health, seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. In your opinion, why is this done? Since according to the World Health Organization, alcohol is a known carcinogen, sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is no safe amount to avoid its effects, so why is it promoted?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> That&rsquo;s a really good question. I kind of struggled with this over the course of time, when we were running the gym, the timing, the place, we were earlobe deep in real estate agents. I mean, just droves of them. Really interesting people, very diverse cross section of folks. And within that scene, the way you carry yourself, the way you look, that all ends up playing into how effective you are at what you do, because there&rsquo;s a huge social component to building the relationship when somebody&rsquo;s doing the biggest financial decision, often times, of their life.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> So, we had really good success with these folks, they would lose weight, they would feel better, and they had benefits based around that. But then we also had these folks report, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m having some problems because I&rsquo;m used to sitting down, and wining and dining people, and building that relationship &hellip; &ldquo;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Meeting people, networking over &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Meeting people, networking &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Drinks and dinner.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Yeah. And there&rsquo;s just kind of a reality that, I think you&rsquo;re hard pressed to find very many cultures, there&rsquo;s a few, that don&rsquo;t use alcohol as a social lubricant, cohesive element. I would venture to say the bulk of cultures, like alcohol is a feature of the whole story. So, you know, we can get totally wrapped around the axle of, protein, carbs, fat, and circadian biology, and all the stuff. But we always mention the social component, and the community component, we know that an inadequate social connectivity is as negatively impactful on health as a pack a day smoking habit.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> So, you know, it&rsquo;s a really interesting question though, you know, so I&rsquo;m ingesting a known carcinogen, to have a social connectivity that maybe &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Given me joy, and is fun, and makes life &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Yeah. And what&rsquo;s the net win on that? I don&rsquo;t entirely know. But eve for myself, I honestly am not a huge fan of booze, it&rsquo;s not my preferred cup of opiates, but it &hellip; There&rsquo;s also kind of a reality that, I already eat differently than most people. It&rsquo;s changed a lot over the last 20 years, so it&rsquo;s easier to find community, easier to find folks that don&rsquo;t look [inaudible 00:06:34] at me if I order a burger without a bun. It&rsquo;s just not a big deal now, whereas 15, 20 years ago, you were totally a weirdo doing that.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But if we go hang out with friends, of we have a family gathering or something, like having a glass of wine, putting some element into a NorCal margarita, or something, that&rsquo;s super nice. It&rsquo;s just kinda nice to unwind and relax with that.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> So, Jay, I don&rsquo;t know if that super answers your question, but &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> I think there&rsquo;s also a reality that, when you&rsquo;re trying to get people to start changing their food, and removing a lot of these processed foods, it&rsquo;s like a baby step sort of thing. SO, if you said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna eat any grains, no dairy, and no booze.&rdquo; How many people would even give it a shot? Whereas, if you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re gonna cut out the grains, you&rsquo;re gonna try to eliminate dairy if it &hellip; Or at least see if it gives you problems and then maybe reintroduce &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And on booze &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> On booze, have a glass of red wine, or a NorCal margarita. And then over time, people just start drinking less anyway, because they notice the effects, and how their body feels with the alcohol, how it affects their sleep &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But that step wise story is a really important point, which I kind of neglected. Some people can jump in whole hog, and they just cut everything out, other people do better with a stepwise fashion. For a lot of people, if you suggest booze needs to come out of the rotation, they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Fuck it. I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> I mean, how many people have transformed their health with this ancestral health concept, right? And how many of those wouldn&rsquo;t have even given it a shot if, in order to do it, it was zero booze?</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Yeah.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> So.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> So, I don&rsquo;t know, Jay, if that fully answers the question of the risk reward story of allowing, or recommending booze. But I think that this is a great example of trying to not make perfection the antagonist of good enough. Like, if we&rsquo;re getting people off of refined carbohydrates, they&rsquo;re sleeping better, they&rsquo;re exercising, they feel better, then to your point, it really is true. If they start feeling better in general, what we find, is that people have a drink, maybe two, and then they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; Because they feel shitty enough from that, that they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m totally good.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> So, interestingly, it does kind of self regulate on the back end of that, if we get the buy in on the front end with all those other things. But if you&rsquo;re just living like a cockroach, and you just feel like shit all the time, it&rsquo;s really hard to de-tangle, is it the crappy carbohydrates? Is it the booze? Is it &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> The lack of sleep.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> The lack of sleep, yeah, because it&rsquo;s all on top of you. But you start feeling better, and you actually notice the difference when you have booze.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Okay.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Our next question is from Felipe, he says, &ldquo;Paleo lifestyle is a way of minimizing the occurrence of cancer in former smokers. Hey Rob, thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective and personal health, your teachings left a lasting and highly beneficial imprint on my health, and on my wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the US alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> So, this is really interesting, and there&rsquo;s actually a very interesting development of late. Philip Morris, tobacco manufacturer extraordinaire, for a couple of hundred years, I think, they&rsquo;ve been making tobacco products. They just started offering life insurance for people who quit smoking. There&rsquo;s all kinds of interesting economic things to be learned from that, but it&rsquo;s really interesting that the most important thing to do as a smoker, if you wanna minimize your risk of all the associated problems, is to just stop smoking.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Like, if you just stop smoking, the change that occurs on your risk profile is nothing short of amazing. And then beyond that, circadian biology, I would probably put right at the top of the list, get out in the sun early, get that sun on your skin, appropriate vitamin D levels, go to bed early. That circadian biology piece, I could almost make an argument, is more important on the whole cancer story. I may modify that over time.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But people get super focused on food, and the food is important. And again, for the cancer story, just not overeating is a huge factor. And then we start iterating beyond that. This is maybe a scenario though, that we could make a case for a couple of three to five day fasts a year, even for the first couple of years. It&rsquo;s maybe an argument for a 16/eight eating window, and stuff like that.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But again, all of that stuff, I can&rsquo;t emphasize it enough, it&rsquo;s really cool. It&rsquo;s really interesting, it may end up being the bees knees as we move along. But if we know anything for sure, if we sleep better, if we do some exercise, if we get out in the sun, if we lift some weights, if we don&rsquo;t overeat, then we&rsquo;re stacking the deck massively in our favor, we know that for a fact. And then some of these other things, if they&rsquo;re amenable to your lifestyle, sure, drop them in. Little 16/eight fasting, maybe some extended ketosis, maybe a longer fast a couple of times a year.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But those things, I would definitely put in the highly speculative category at this point. Not that they&rsquo;re not valuable, not that we shouldn&rsquo;t investigate them, but really make sure that you are buttoned up on the things that we know about first, and then we can start iterating from there.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And I&rsquo;m stoked that we&rsquo;ve had influence on what you&rsquo;ve done. Yeah. I could never get my parents to stop smoking, and that was one of the things that I just begged them to do. So that&rsquo;s awesome that this has been a part of what&rsquo;s happened.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Okay.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Our next question is from Duey, on gymnastics and jits. &ldquo;Hey Rob, I&rsquo;m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings. Do you have any free resources for beginners that you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu. Straight arm strength, in particular, is tough to come by, trying to find progressions for those. Also, I&rsquo;m curious as to what you do for neck and wrist conditioning, mine are always creaky from grappling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Tap earlier. So, on the ring strength work, there&rsquo;s a great book called, Overcoming Gravity, and, huge tome, but really has some slick progressions in it. Very simple. I&rsquo;ve always like gymnastics bodies. The progressions tend to be a little on the long side, which I think is laudable, because coach Christopher Sommer put a lot of thought into that stuff. But sometimes folks just kinda run aground on that, so I would check out the book, Overcoming Gravity.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And then on the neck and wrist conditioning, Nicki got me into the Kinstretch stuff, in which we do something called &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> If you look up, functional range conditioning, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s tons of YouTube videos on it, but you can learn how to do, what&rsquo;s called CARs, Controlled Articular Rotations. And they have them for the neck, they have a wrist series as well. So, I mean, that something you should do every single day.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And then, in poking around, you know, classic wrestler bridging, and stuff like that. There&rsquo;s some information back and forth on whether or not one should do that, if you didn&rsquo;t develop that skillset as a kid, then maybe it&rsquo;s not as good. But, you know, doing a basic neck harness in strengthening the neck, inflection, extension, you know, lateral movement. There&rsquo;s a thing called the iron halo, I believe, something like that, that I&rsquo;ve been looking at. It&rsquo;s like 600 bucks though, so it&rsquo;s kinda pricey, but it looks really good. It sits on your head, and you hook it up to, either a pulley system, or a weights system, and then you can &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> So, is it like, resisting as you &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> It&rsquo;s resisting through all these different, you know, ranges of movement. Those things are really helpful. If you have a partner that is willing to help you with things, that can just provide manual resistance with all the different directions, that&rsquo;s kind of a pain in the ass to do sometimes though, but that&rsquo;s definitely helpful.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But then on the wrists, in particular, again, kind of back to the gymnastics bodies, or even some of the stuff from, Overcoming Gravity, like there&rsquo;s the push ups, where you push up onto the wrist, and on the back of the hands. And you can go from kneeling, in which I push up, and then extend up on the kind of backs of the finger tips, and then lower down.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> So, again, there&rsquo;s &hellip; If you poke around a little bit, there&rsquo;s some good wrist conditioning stuff. Just getting, either a weighted &hellip; a pretty good sized hammer, or a bar with, like the, where you can put weights on one side, and doing the rotation, flexion, extension, like there&rsquo;s all these different movements you can do with that. It&rsquo;s really valuable, and really effective, but it&rsquo;s super simple stuff. You just kind of need to get a little bit of a template, or an idea of some of the things to drop in on that.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Okay.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Let&rsquo;s see. Our last question for this week is from Cathleen, on oil roasted almonds.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> &ldquo;Rob, first, I wanna say thank you for all the valuable info you provide. You&rsquo;re one of the few voices I fully rust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new. With that, I have heard you say that you eat a lot of Blue Diamond smoke housed almonds, and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them, in favor of the Blue Diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smoke housed say that they may be roasted in Canola, or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable and Canola oil wherever possible, but I assume the amount of oil that you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? IF everything is dialed in, and you&rsquo;re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you&rsquo;d be getting from this? Or, have you seen that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem? Thanks in advance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Man, so one thing, I&rsquo;m not doing so well with the almonds anymore. But I think that that&rsquo;s more of an oxalate issue, is I&rsquo;ve kind of poked around on that ironically, they taste so good. But, yeah, I get some kind of gnarly belly from it. Macadamias are kind of the main nut that I do occasionally, and even that I &hellip; Funny enough, I&rsquo;m eating fewer and fewer vegetable sources, and shifting more and more carnivore, just tinkering with how my gut feels, how my digestion feels. I did like a three week, four week carnivore deal, and I kind of went insane because I just wanted a fucking avocado, and some artichokes, and stuff.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But eating keto, I never had food cravings, and then when I did that, I really went kind of bananas. But it is funny, I&rsquo;ve been noticing, I&rsquo;m kind of gravitating more that direction. I seem to do well with fruit, up to a point. So, it&rsquo;s interesting, I&rsquo;m still tinkering with that.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But that&rsquo;s not really the question, the question is related to, that fats in here. I don&rsquo;t know that anybody knows what exactly the safe amount is on these seed oils. There&rsquo;s not a lot that goes into something like these roasted almonds, it&rsquo;s a very passing amount. If you are deficient in elongated omega 6 Arachidonic acid, and also, EPA/DHA, then these shorter chain polyunsaturated fats are more of an issue with regards to inflammation.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> But this is one of the things that, you know, it&rsquo;s like, people will freak out if they go out to eat and, I don&rsquo;t know, Chipotle, or something like that. You&rsquo;re on the road, you&rsquo;re looking for food, you have no other options, and you go into Chipotle or something, and it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Oh, they use Canola oil.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s like, well, either starve, or eat that one meal. And you&rsquo;re not having refined grains, presumably, you&rsquo;re not having sugar, you&rsquo;re not drinking soda, so, is that really the place to freak out about it?</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And if you have serious health problems, and you notice that you react to that stuff, then I guess that&rsquo;s a different story. But I&rsquo;ve historically not been super freaked out about stuff like that. So, it&rsquo;s interesting. Would I prefer that they use coconut oil on to, or something? Yeah, probably, but coconut oil has a very specific, distinct flavor, so it&rsquo;s kind of tough in that regard too. So, yeah, I mean, I historically have not been that freaked out about a lot of vegetable oil here.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> I remember when I did &hellip; Posted eating some, not sardines, but the oysters.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Oysters in cottonseed oil.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And they were in cottonseed oil. Fuck, man, people lost their minds. And one, you just don&rsquo;t get that much, there&rsquo;s not, you know &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> You weren&rsquo;t drinking the oil.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Yeah, I don&rsquo;t drink the oil, you drain it, you can even rinse it a little bit. But these things are &hellip; It&rsquo;s another thing where people [inaudible 00:19:42] me with all these options for non-cotton seed oil varieties, and that&rsquo;s great, but the places that we typically shop don&rsquo;t have those. And it&rsquo;s just another pain in my ass to, okay, am I gonna order it online, or whatever, and I have them reasonably frequently, but not every single day, so. And again, in the greater mix of life, it&rsquo;s like, I like them, they taste really good, I think that there&rsquo;s other healthful benefits to it, and so it&rsquo;s kind of that cost benefit trade off on that.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it&rsquo;s fucking killing me, and I&rsquo;m being an idiot with it, but it&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t like obsessing over every Goddamn thing that I put in my mouth. Like, I&rsquo;m super gluten intolerant, I&rsquo;m not all that good at handling carbs, so I&rsquo;m already kind of fucking limited, and it&rsquo;s just kind like, Jesus Christ, I just wanna eat sometimes, you know. And that is &hellip;</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Sometimes I&rsquo;m hesitant to even post what I eat online because again, all the armchair warriors jump in, and everybody&rsquo;s got a fucking opinion, and they know me better than I know me. But at the same time, what ends up happening when I get in and battle with those dick heads sometimes is that, the people who are watching, I&rsquo;m learning more and more that it&rsquo;s not so much about the interaction I&rsquo;m having with a specific person, it&rsquo;s everybody else watching.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> And they&rsquo;re watching somebody that, and I&rsquo;m very grateful for this and I take it very seriously, someone that they respect with regards to how they approach this stuff. And I&rsquo;m not obsessive, I&rsquo;m not neurotic, there&rsquo;s some things that I don&rsquo;t have a lot of flexibility on. I&rsquo;m not gonna, on a daily basis, sit down and eat 100 grams of carbs from rice, because it&rsquo;s gonna fuck me up, and I&rsquo;m gonna feel terrible, and I&rsquo;ll probably die from diabetes with it. But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m gonna die from a little bit of seed oil in almonds, or tinned fish, or something like that. So, that kind of got off in the weeds, but.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Okay.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Any other, you have any thoughts on that? I mean, you navigate this stuff pretty well too, just being flexible with what you&rsquo;re doing, and.</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> I have nothing to add.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> You have nothing to add. Okay. Okay.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Well, should we thank our show sponsor?</p>\n<p><b>Nicki:</b> Yeah. Thanks to our show sponsor, Element Recharge. You can follow them at @drinkLMNT, on Instagram, Facebook, etc. It&rsquo;s an electrolyte drink mix, to fuel everything that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n<p><b>Robb:</b> Especially if you&rsquo;re doing some sort of a low carb, or a ketogenic diet. You need to be on point with your electrolytes, in particular, sodium.
