He might be after a young, male Targ he can inhabit, and my suspicion is, that he is after Jon.

Her being a Regent for Rickon would be great, but her entire arc being political makes me more inclined for her to be the sole ruler, instead of Bran or Rickon. GRRM highlighted the fact that there's never been a female ruler of Winterfell multiple times, and if the series doesn't end with a woman as Winterfell's leader (not a consort or a Regent) it would be almost disappointing",

Personally, I\u2019d love nothing more than for the surviving Starklings to work as a unit post-war. Give me Bran the Rebuilder using his magical knowledge to rebuild Winterfell and the North. Give me Sansa taking on the day-to-day ruling and her ancestors\u2019 historical duty to care and provide for her people. Give me Arya being the North\u2019s protector and warrior. Rebuild, provide and protect. I\u2019m in love with the idea of them being a ruling unit that embodies the very role Winterfell was built for, each with their own area of expertise to reflect their current training montages.<br/></p>",
