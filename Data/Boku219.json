There are people staring at him, people he didn\u2019t even know before the sports festival, people he never cared about. While his classmates had known his quirk from day one, these students hadn\u2019t and Shinsou can feel the weight of their stares like tons of pressure pushing down on his shoulders.</p><p>The tension doesn\u2019t leave for weeks. The eyes still follow him around, like these people are waiting for the moment he\u2019s no longer a comrade but an enemy in the making. It makes him feel cold and sends him to the empty training rooms well past open hours. It\u2019s better than the dorms\u2026 much better than home.<br/></p><p>That\u2019s where he meets Aizawa-sensei, homeroom teacher of class 1-A. His first reaction is to go stone like and freeze when the man slips in and makes himself known, likely a good while after he\u2019s already been there, watching Shinsou go at a bag until his knuckles felt ready to pop out of their joints. They stare at each other, Shinsou winded and panting for breath and Aizawa, leaned back against the door frame, arms folded over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shinsou asks. He knows his tone holds no respect but it\u2019s late and he\u2019s so fucking <i>done </i>with his day. He doesn\u2019t need anyone just standing there and judging him.</p><p>\u201cYour stance is off.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a blatant answer to his question and Shinsou can feel the automatic space where his consciousness could push in, the moment where there\u2019s a hollow emptiness for his quirk to slip through Aizawa\u2019s defenses. He expects the teacher to activate his own quirk the moment he responds but he doesn\u2019t even twitch at Shinsou whose shoulders are still tense and shaking. It\u2019s those sickening thoughts, those moments in between his choice of taking control or not where other peoples whisper of <i>\u201cvillain\u201d </i>makes him want to press in, just out of spite. He thinks Aizawa has to see that in his eyes, the anger, the <i>burn </i>of it all. That\u2019s why he steps further into the room and shows him how to punch the bag right.</p><p>It goes on from there. Months into the newest semester and he\u2019s learning how to use capture tape, a scarf of the stuff bundled on his shoulders exactly like Aizawa\u2019s. Shinsou will admit to no one that his throat had gotten terribly tight when the teacher held it out for him to take one afternoon. When Aizawa leads him to the support room to get fitted into hero gear, he almost cries. He tells no one in his class and no one at home about the actual hero training he\u2019s receiving. He doesn\u2019t want to hear their reactions.</p><p>He can\u2019t always keep it under wraps though, it\u2019s not like his sensei cares about what students or other teachers think. He can feel those eyes on him when Aizawa pulls him aside to remind him about training and push a juice pack into his hands. He can hear their whispers even if they hide them behind their hands.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhy\u2019s a hero course teacher paying attention to him?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s controlling him\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat guy\u2019s still playing a hero?\u201d</i></p><p>Shinsou can feel acid on his tongue and each little blank space he could fill to get them to<i> shut up</i>.

Instead, he blows off his lunch meeting with Aizawa and goes to what he\u2019s come to consider <i>his </i>training room. There\u2019s where Aizawa finds him twenty minutes later.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, he doesn\u2019t have to, for Shinsou to know that he\u2019s there. They\u2019ve been training long enough now that Shinsou can pick up his specific presence more easily than anyone else. The teacher is silent as he watches Shinsou go at his bag, fists hastily bandaged but at the very least protected. Aizawa, like he always does, like no one else in his fucking life because they\u2019re <i>terrified </i>of what Shinsou could do to them, waits for the boy to speak first.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make them shut up.\u201d He hits the bag, each slam of his fist punctuating his sentences as he lets go of the feelings in his chest. \u201cI wanted to slip in and make them <i>stop</i>.

But the way his stomach twists with nausea only tells him how much he desired it.</p><p>Shinsou, for all his knowledge that Aizawa is there, doesn\u2019t know until he\u2019s turning around, expecting a response of some kind, that Aizawa is right behind him, one hand in his pocket, the other already raised to catch Shinsou\u2019s trembling shoulders. This time he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s shaking with nerves or with fatigue. Aizawa is pretty much the only person in his life that isn\u2019t scared of him and Shinsou, for all his bluster, doesn\u2019t want his sensei to start being that way because of those urges. Aizawa\u2019s fingers curl over his shoulder and silently tugs him into a strange but warm hug. Shinsou had almost forgotten what those felt like. He shakes harder in the teacher\u2019s arms.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou are better than you think,\u201d</i></b> Aizawa starts out, his chin propped up on Shinsou\u2019s head. <b><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have \u2018bad\u2019 thoughts as long as you don\u2019t act on them.\u201d</i></b> Shinsou starts to shudder harder against his chest and Aizawa feels the boy\u2019s hands go to his back and clench down hard.<i><b> \u201cI believe in you,\u201d</b></i> it\u2019s said softer as he holds the kid just a bit tighter. In the back of his mind, Aizawa doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s possessed him to be this soft.

Aizawa tucks his free hand into his pocket and steps back. There\u2019s a moment of silence before he turns on his heel.</p><p>\u201cClass is in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>Aizawa smirks.</p><p>\u201cAnd your stance was off again.\u201d There\u2019s a choked off cry of indignation thrown at his back as he heads to his class, one in which, he hopes to see his protege\u2019s face in very soon.</p>",

There are people staring at him, people he didn\u2019t even know before the sports festival, people he never cared about. While his classmates had known his quirk from day one, these students hadn\u2019t and Shinsou can feel the weight of their stares like tons of pressure pushing down on his shoulders.</p><p>The tension doesn\u2019t leave for weeks. The eyes still follow him around, like these people are waiting for the moment he\u2019s no longer a comrade but an enemy in the making. It makes him feel cold and sends him to the empty training rooms well past open hours. It\u2019s better than the dorms\u2026 much better than home.<br></p><p>That\u2019s where he meets Aizawa-sensei, homeroom teacher of class 1-A. His first reaction is to go stone like and freeze when the man slips in and makes himself known, likely a good while after he\u2019s already been there, watching Shinsou go at a bag until his knuckles felt ready to pop out of their joints. They stare at each other, Shinsou winded and panting for breath and Aizawa, leaned back against the door frame, arms folded over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shinsou asks. He knows his tone holds no respect but it\u2019s late and he\u2019s so fucking <i>done </i>with his day. He doesn\u2019t need anyone just standing there and judging him.</p><p>\u201cYour stance is off.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a blatant answer to his question and Shinsou can feel the automatic space where his consciousness could push in, the moment where there\u2019s a hollow emptiness for his quirk to slip through Aizawa\u2019s defenses. He expects the teacher to activate his own quirk the moment he responds but he doesn\u2019t even twitch at Shinsou whose shoulders are still tense and shaking. It\u2019s those sickening thoughts, those moments in between his choice of taking control or not where other peoples whisper of <i>\u201cvillain\u201d </i>makes him want to press in, just out of spite. He thinks Aizawa has to see that in his eyes, the anger, the <i>burn </i>of it all. That\u2019s why he steps further into the room and shows him how to punch the bag right.</p><p>It goes on from there. Months into the newest semester and he\u2019s learning how to use capture tape, a scarf of the stuff bundled on his shoulders exactly like Aizawa\u2019s. Shinsou will admit to no one that his throat had gotten terribly tight when the teacher held it out for him to take one afternoon. When Aizawa leads him to the support room to get fitted into hero gear, he almost cries. He tells no one in his class and no one at home about the actual hero training he\u2019s receiving. He doesn\u2019t want to hear their reactions.</p><p>He can\u2019t always keep it under wraps though, it\u2019s not like his sensei cares about what students or other teachers think. He can feel those eyes on him when Aizawa pulls him aside to remind him about training and push a juice pack into his hands. He can hear their whispers even if they hide them behind their hands.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cWhy\u2019s a hero course teacher paying attention to him?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s controlling him\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThat guy\u2019s still playing a hero?\u201d</i></p><p>Shinsou can feel acid on his tongue and each little blank space he could fill to get them to<i> shut up</i>. It would be easy, slipping into those cracks and embarrassing them like they\u2019re doing to him. Instead, he blows off his lunch meeting with Aizawa and goes to what he\u2019s come to consider <i>his </i>training room. There\u2019s where Aizawa finds him twenty minutes later.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, he doesn\u2019t have to, for Shinsou to know that he\u2019s there. They\u2019ve been training long enough now that Shinsou can pick up his specific presence more easily than anyone else. The teacher is silent as he watches Shinsou go at his bag, fists hastily bandaged but at the very least protected. Aizawa, like he always does, like no one else in his fucking life because they\u2019re <i>terrified </i>of what Shinsou could do to them, waits for the boy to speak first.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make them shut up.\u201d He hits the bag, each slam of his fist punctuating his sentences as he lets go of the feelings in his chest. \u201cI wanted to slip in and make them <i>stop</i>. I could have done it. So easily. I <i>wanted </i>to.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say he should have, because he knows he shouldn\u2019t and he won\u2019t. He never would. But the way his stomach twists with nausea only tells him how much he desired it.</p><p>Shinsou, for all his knowledge that Aizawa is there, doesn\u2019t know until he\u2019s turning around, expecting a response of some kind, that Aizawa is right behind him, one hand in his pocket, the other already raised to catch Shinsou\u2019s trembling shoulders. This time he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s shaking with nerves or with fatigue. Aizawa is pretty much the only person in his life that isn\u2019t scared of him and Shinsou, for all his bluster, doesn\u2019t want his sensei to start being that way because of those urges. Aizawa\u2019s fingers curl over his shoulder and silently tugs him into a strange but warm hug. Shinsou had almost forgotten what those felt like. He shakes harder in the teacher\u2019s arms.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou are better than you think,\u201d</i></b> Aizawa starts out, his chin propped up on Shinsou\u2019s head. <b><i>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have \u2018bad\u2019 thoughts as long as you don\u2019t act on them.\u201d</i></b> Shinsou starts to shudder harder against his chest and Aizawa feels the boy\u2019s hands go to his back and clench down hard.<i><b> \u201cI believe in you,\u201d</b></i> it\u2019s said softer as he holds the kid just a bit tighter. In the back of his mind, Aizawa doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s possessed him to be this soft. Maybe it was the look in Shinsou\u2019s eyes that first night in the training room, or the determination in his shoulders as he keeps his head high regardless of the <i>not </i>subtle whispers that followed him, or maybe, just maybe, he\u2019s saying it because he\u2019s reminded of himself, more than a decade younger, and the words he\u2019d wished someone had said to him when he\u2019d been in such a similar position.</p><p>They pull back and Shinsou wipes his eyes with the back of his hand, quick, like he\u2019s just rubbing away dust instead of half-shed tears. Aizawa tucks his free hand into his pocket and steps back. There\u2019s a moment of silence before he turns on his heel.</p><p>\u201cClass is in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>Aizawa smirks.</p><p>\u201cAnd your stance was off again.\u201d There\u2019s a choked off cry of indignation thrown at his back as he heads to his class, one in which, he hopes to see his protege\u2019s face in very soon.</p>",
