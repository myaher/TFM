They still haunted her, night after night, preventing her from any true rest. Tonight was no different&ndash; She lay starring at her ceiling, her eyes scrolling over the pattern of cracks in the stone. Sleep never came easy, for she knew what awaited her when her subconscious overtook her. The nightmares that were not nightmares at all, but memories replayed like a queer song one could not rid themselves of, no matter how strong the desire. She tossed in her featherbed, sighing as she nuzzled into her pillow. A Queen with no sleep was a Queen destined for death, but Sansa had been destined for death for a long time now. And yet here she was. Living.</p><p>The thought gave little comfort, but comfort enough that she was able to close her eyes. She had thousands ready to protect her now. Thousands who would throw themselves on a blade if it meant she may live&ndash; She would never ask of them such a task, but still, this thought gave comfort. Little comfort after little comfort built a wall inside her head, the same wall she built every night before she slept, the same wall that was dismantled in her nightmares. </p><p>Her nightmares changed often in their stories. Most often they were the face of Ramsay, hovering over her with hellfire burning in his eyes. Always his image brought with it the memories of pain&ndash; She could not feel the pain in her dreams, but it burned her body when she opened her eyes. Sometimes the nightmares were of her lost family, the beheading of her father, the brutal scene she imagined as the deathscene of her eldest brother and mother, the arrow that struck her youngest brother dead&hellip; Some nightmares were stories drawn from her own subconscious, of the things she feared most; more death, more rape, more pain.</p><p>She woke to the sound of screaming, and sat bolt-upright in bed, wondering who it was the made the sound, wondering who it was that required assistance. It sounded like the scream of a frightened child, and she prepared herself to leave her room with a small dagger in hand and fight the threat as best she could. It was only when she forced herself to catch her breath that she realized the sound had come from her. Her throat was sore and her cheeks wet with tears. She allowed a sob to escape her, and she pulled her feather-blanket tighter over her, letting out a startled scream as her chamber door flung open.</p><p>The Hound stood before her, a sword outstretched as his eyes took scan of the dark room. The only light came from the fullmoon outside, and it cast shadows on the wall, shadows Sansa found herself weary of. &ldquo;Are you harmed?&rdquo; Sandor demanded, bristling at the expectation of a battle.</p><p>&ldquo;No, Sandor. I am fine,&rdquo; Sansa offered sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;People who are fine don&rsquo;t alert their guardsmen by screaming bloody-murder.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My apologies, Sandor. I didn&rsquo;t mean to wake you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he sheathed his sword, the sound of metal against metal grating to Sansa. &ldquo;What woke you?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa considered lying to him. She considered saying a stray rat had crawled across her bed and startled her, but she knew Sandor would be the wiser. She had become quite adept at lying over the years, yet still she could never lie to him. &ldquo;Nightmares.&rdquo; She felt a fool after admitting it, and pulled her knees to chest, wrapping her arms around them. &ldquo;Only children are frightened by dreams.&rdquo; She chided herself, resting her chin on her knees. </p><p>&ldquo;Children dream of ghosts and monsters who live under their bed. I trust your dreams are of neither.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sansa said coolly, daring to glance up at him. &ldquo;My dreams are of the monster who lived *in* my bed.&rdquo; </p><p>Sandor&rsquo;s face fell into a look she had never seen on a man before; some combination of hatred and sorrow. She shivered in her featherbed, only partly due to the cold. Her fire had since died, with only a few embers remaining in the hearth. Sandor moved to the stack of firewood she kept near her hearth, grabbing a few small pieces and kneeling down in front of the embers. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to, Sandor. I know you do not care for fire.&rdquo; He just grunted in response, prodding log and ember until a flame took root, steadily growing, illuminating the room with moon- and fire- light.</p><p>&ldquo;You may be a Northerner, but Northern men still freeze,&rdquo; Sandor chided as he stepped away from the fire, the flames causing shadows to dance across his facial features. Sansa openly starred at him&ndash; His scar was colourless in this light, but tore his face nearly in half, and the shadows that danced along it made the cuts seem deeper, more severe, like rivers jutting through a forest. He had gained new scars over the years, and those too were hooded, shadows dancing across them as he moved. Still, she found no fear in her heart when she looked at his haggard appearance. She thought him handsome, a handsome that went deeper than pretty skin and chiseled jaw. She drew comfort from his appearance, from his ability to appear when he needed her. </p><p>He crossed the room, making for her door now that her breathing had settled and her fire had grown. &ldquo;Sandor,&rdquo; she called to him, her voice wavering. He stopped in his tracks, turning to look at her. He was wearing a heavy fur cloak that rustled as he spun to face her, and his sword made a light smack against his breeches. &ldquo;Will you&hellip; Will you stay with me?&rdquo; She felt a fool for asking, for daring to invite another man into her space when her cause for fear had been due to the very reason. But Sandor Clegane was not Ramsay Bolton. Sandor Clegane was not a great man, but he was a good man. He had proven such in fighting the dead, in fighting against Cersei, in returning to her and becoming the head of her Queensguard. He had proven such during all the times he could have done terrible things, and chose not to. </p><p>Even now. It was her alone in her bedchamber. No other guards were around, Sandor had elected to stand guard on this night. He could have been evil, or wicked, but the thought had not crossed his mind, she knew. Even with open invitation to remain, he seemed hesitant. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she whispered, feeling her cheeks heat at the request, thankful that the discolouration in the room would hide her embarrassment. She made room for him to sit next to her on the featherbed, and, hesitantly, he did.</p><p>Her bed sagged under his added weight, and the depression in the mattress caused her to fall closer to him. He had taken off his sword and sheath and rest it on the table near her bedside, and she now sat with her legs still under-cover, still close to her chest, and his back nearly resting against them. &ldquo;I am so tired, Sandor,&rdquo; she admitted, and both knew it was only partially due to her lack of sleep.</p><p>Sandor turned to her, running large, calloused fingers through her soft, fine hair. &ldquo;I know, Little Bird, I know.&rdquo; </p><p>She smiled at the nickname, feeling a wave of peace rush over her. Little Bird. She was always safe when he called her Little Bird. &ldquo;Will you sit with me, just until I fall asleep?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, and she smiled. She stretched her legs out once more, her feathercover resting over them, Sandor sitting near to them, with his legs over the side of the bed. He pulled the cover up over her shoulder she settled onto her side, and his fingers brushed her red hair from her face, lightly grazing her cheek. &ldquo;Goodnight, Little Bird.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Sandor.&rdquo;</p><p>She awoke late the next morning, the sun at full height and beating through her chamber window. She felt rested, more rested than she could even remember. She had not been plagued by nightmares for the second-half of the eve. And she felt warm. So warm. She turned under the cover, slowly sitting upright. Sandor&rsquo;s fur cloak was draped over her, twice her size and warmer than the fire that had once again turned to glowing embers in the hearth. She pulled it tightly around her, inhaling. The smell of pine greeted her, and she remembered her dream, the dream that had not been a nightmare, the dream that had kept the nightmares away&ndash; She had been seated in the wood, the smell of pine overpowering all else, and a scruffy dog lying happily at her feet.</p>",

Thousands who would throw themselves on a blade if it meant she may live\u2013 She would never ask of them such a task, but still, this thought gave comfort. Little comfort after little comfort built a wall inside her head, the same wall she built every night before she slept, the same wall that was dismantled in her nightmares. </p><p>Her nightmares changed often in their stories. Most often they were the face of Ramsay, hovering over her with hellfire burning in his eyes. Always his image brought with it the memories of pain\u2013 She could not feel the pain in her dreams, but it burned her body when she opened her eyes. Sometimes the nightmares were of her lost family, the beheading of her father, the brutal scene she imagined as the deathscene of her eldest brother and mother, the arrow that struck her youngest brother dead\u2026 Some nightmares were stories drawn from her own subconscious, of the things she feared most; more death, more rape, more pain.</p><p>She woke to the sound of screaming, and sat bolt-upright in bed, wondering who it was the made the sound, wondering who it was that required assistance. It sounded like the scream of a frightened child, and she prepared herself to leave her room with a small dagger in hand and fight the threat as best she could. It was only when she forced herself to catch her breath that she realized the sound had come from her. Her throat was sore and her cheeks wet with tears. She allowed a sob to escape her, and she pulled her feather-blanket tighter over her, letting out a startled scream as her chamber door flung open.</p><p>The Hound stood before her, a sword outstretched as his eyes took scan of the dark room. The only light came from the fullmoon outside, and it cast shadows on the wall, shadows Sansa found herself weary of. \u201cAre you harmed?\u201d Sandor demanded, bristling at the expectation of a battle.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sandor. I am fine,\u201d Sansa offered sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cPeople who are fine don\u2019t alert their guardsmen by screaming bloody-murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Sandor. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d he sheathed his sword, the sound of metal against metal grating to Sansa. \u201cWhat woke you?\u201d</p><p>Sansa considered lying to him. She considered saying a stray rat had crawled across her bed and startled her, but she knew Sandor would be the wiser. She had become quite adept at lying over the years, yet still she could never lie to him. \u201cNightmares.\u201d She felt a fool after admitting it, and pulled her knees to chest, wrapping her arms around them. \u201cOnly children are frightened by dreams.\u201d She chided herself, resting her chin on her knees. </p><p>\u201cChildren dream of ghosts and monsters who live under their bed. I trust your dreams are of neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa said coolly, daring to glance up at him. \u201cMy dreams are of the monster who lived *in* my bed.\u201d </p><p>Sandor\u2019s face fell into a look she had never seen on a man before; some combination of hatred and sorrow. She shivered in her featherbed, only partly due to the cold. Her fire had since died, with only a few embers remaining in the hearth. Sandor moved to the stack of firewood she kept near her hearth, grabbing a few small pieces and kneeling down in front of the embers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Sandor. I know you do not care for fire.\u201d He just grunted in response, prodding log and ember until a flame took root, steadily growing, illuminating the room with moon- and fire- light.</p><p>\u201cYou may be a Northerner, but Northern men still freeze,\u201d Sandor chided as he stepped away from the fire, the flames causing shadows to dance across his facial features. Sansa openly starred at him\u2013 His scar was colourless in this light, but tore his face nearly in half, and the shadows that danced along it made the cuts seem deeper, more severe, like rivers jutting through a forest. He had gained new scars over the years, and those too were hooded, shadows dancing across them as he moved. Still, she found no fear in her heart when she looked at his haggard appearance. She thought him handsome, a handsome that went deeper than pretty skin and chiseled jaw. She drew comfort from his appearance, from his ability to appear when he needed her. </p><p>He crossed the room, making for her door now that her breathing had settled and her fire had grown. \u201cSandor,\u201d she called to him, her voice wavering. He stopped in his tracks, turning to look at her. He was wearing a heavy fur cloak that rustled as he spun to face her, and his sword made a light smack against his breeches. \u201cWill you\u2026 Will you stay with me?\u201d She felt a fool for asking, for daring to invite another man into her space when her cause for fear had been due to the very reason. But Sandor Clegane was not Ramsay Bolton. Sandor Clegane was not a great man, but he was a good man. He had proven such in fighting the dead, in fighting against Cersei, in returning to her and becoming the head of her Queensguard. He had proven such during all the times he could have done terrible things, and chose not to. </p><p>Even now. It was her alone in her bedchamber. No other guards were around, Sandor had elected to stand guard on this night. He could have been evil, or wicked, but the thought had not crossed his mind, she knew. Even with open invitation to remain, he seemed hesitant. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, feeling her cheeks heat at the request, thankful that the discolouration in the room would hide her embarrassment. She made room for him to sit next to her on the featherbed, and, hesitantly, he did.</p><p>Her bed sagged under his added weight, and the depression in the mattress caused her to fall closer to him. He had taken off his sword and sheath and rest it on the table near her bedside, and she now sat with her legs still under-cover, still close to her chest, and his back nearly resting against them. \u201cI am so tired, Sandor,\u201d she admitted, and both knew it was only partially due to her lack of sleep.</p><p>Sandor turned to her, running large, calloused fingers through her soft, fine hair. \u201cI know, Little Bird, I know.\u201d </p><p>She smiled at the nickname, feeling a wave of peace rush over her. Little Bird. She was always safe when he called her Little Bird. \u201cWill you sit with me, just until I fall asleep?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and she smiled. She stretched her legs out once more, her feathercover resting over them, Sandor sitting near to them, with his legs over the side of the bed. He pulled the cover up over her shoulder she settled onto her side, and his fingers brushed her red hair from her face, lightly grazing her cheek. \u201cGoodnight, Little Bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Sandor.\u201d</p><p>She awoke late the next morning, the sun at full height and beating through her chamber window. She felt rested, more rested than she could even remember. She had not been plagued by nightmares for the second-half of the eve. And she felt warm. So warm. She turned under the cover, slowly sitting upright. Sandor\u2019s fur cloak was draped over her, twice her size and warmer than the fire that had once again turned to glowing embers in the hearth. She pulled it tightly around her, inhaling. The smell of pine greeted her, and she remembered her dream, the dream that had not been a nightmare, the dream that had kept the nightmares away\u2013 She had been seated in the wood, the smell of pine overpowering all else, and a scruffy dog lying happily at her feet.</p>",

        "body": "<p><b>The flight of youth</b></p><p>(AU in which Jon grows up in King&rsquo;s Landing as Robert&rsquo;s ward and Brandon&rsquo;s legitimized bastard.)</p><p>i</p><p>Ned strides out of the Tower of Joy, a screaming child into his arms and the smell of his sister&rsquo;s blood marked upon his skin.</p><p>He rides day and night, the only stops are those to allow the wet nurse to feed the child. He has no name, not yet.</p><p><i>Raise him like he&rsquo;s yours. Protect him.</i> These were Lyanna&rsquo;s last words. It&rsquo;s what he promised and he will do.</p><p>Thoughts assail him in moments of forced quiet, in slumber, gnawing at his soul like rats.</p><p>During the night, when everything is dark and there is no glimmer of light, the burden of the secret and the consequences of his promise weigh heavily on his mind.</p><p>What will people think when they see him return after the war with a bastard in his arms? What will Catelyn think?</p><p>The thought of his wife, of the fragile hopes he had placed in their marriage, the feeling that they had reached an understanding, the certainty of being able to build something together little by little. If not love, at least a relationship of friendship, respect, trust, devotion.</p><p>He keenly feels the loss of what could have been and never will be.</p><p>*</p><p>His precautions don&rsquo;t matter. In the end Robert tracks him.</p><p>(Two days ago he arrived at King&rsquo;s Landing to find the Mad King in a pool of his own blood, to discover the cruel brutality of Elia Martell and her sons deaths.)</p><p>He is not ready, he never will be. Lying is difficult for him. Lying to the boy with whom he grew up and that is like a brother to him seems impossible. It&rsquo;s dishonorable and wrong, but he knows Robert and knows that Lyanna&rsquo;s fear was legitimate. If Robert had the slightest doubt, if he suspected something, it would be the end. It would mean fury and ruin. Too much blood has already been spilled.</p><p>Now or never, he thinks.</p><p>Robert observes the child in his arms and for the first time in the last year it seems that the storm raging at the bottom of his clear eyes subsides. The frenzy that not even Raeghar&rsquo;s death managed to extinguish disappears, buried behind the shadow of a smile that peeks out from his long and bristly beard.</p><p>Ned lets Robert take the child and already feels the absence of his familiar weight against the chest, similar to an amputation.</p><p>He watches as he cradle him, a small and screaming bundle pressed against a mighty chest. Robert still wears his armor and is covered in mud and encrusted blood. Jon doesn&rsquo;t seem to care. He stops crying and in the sudden silence the ringing in his ears becomes the only noise inside the tent. He feels suffocated. The scorching sun of Dorne is far away and so are the desert lands that he has crossed like a man damned by the gods. If he closes his eyes, however, he can still feel the stifling heat of the room in which he found Lyanna, the stench of death.</p><p>&ldquo;Cat will never accept him,&rdquo; says Robert. He&rsquo;s tickling Jon&rsquo;s chin. &ldquo;This will destroy your marriage.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s the truth and perhaps it was the awareness of this that stole his sleep and peace. Not the memory of the dead, but the torment of the living, knowing the battle that awaits him within the walls of his house.</p><p>&ldquo;Give him to me, Ned. Give me your boy and I&rsquo;ll raise him as if he were mine. He will be my ward. The war took Lyanna from me. I won the war for a wolf.&rdquo;</p><p>He wakes up from a nightmare to find himself catapulted into another.</p><p>Now he recognizes the exalted and euphoric expression on Robert&rsquo;s face and hates himself for not immediately noticing. It is the same expression with which he looked at Lyanna, all possessive and fierce tenderness. Lyanna who hated conventions, the restrictions of being a woman. Lyanna who was free and wild and indomitable, but had a kind heart and always dreamed of great adventures, great loves, to live the stories of her favorite books, to become like the heroes of her songs. Lyanna who loved to dance and ride. Lyanna who died, entrusting him with her most precious thing. He is pervaded by an absolute, blinding rage. It is the injustice of everything that has happened to his family. One misfortune after another. And after all that grief, now <i>this</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a trophy, Robert,&rdquo; he says and his voice sounds bitter and terrifying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the life of a child you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;ve sworn to protect him, to keep him safe. On his mother&rsquo;s deathbed, I-&rdquo; he stops abruptly for the horror of what he has just let slip in the heat of the moment. The emotions that have taken over, obscuring the reason. He knows he must have gone pale.</p><p>Robert doesn&rsquo;t flinch. He must have noticed his tension as he must have noticed the suspicious way he stopped talking suddenly.</p><p><i>Gods, let him not understand. Gods, you aren&rsquo;t always just and forgiving. You haven&rsquo;t been with Lyanna. Be with her son.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth.&rdquo; Robert&rsquo;s gaze is open and inquisitive, it seems to pierce him apart. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t yours, is it?&rdquo; Then, like a bolt from the blue, in a thoughtful and unusually serious tone, he asks, &ldquo;Is he Brandon&rsquo;s bastard?&rdquo;</p><p>His surprise twines indissolubly with relief. He thanks all the existing gods, old and new and those who are strangers to him and who have altars of fire, gold and horse bones beyond the Narrow Sea.</p><p>Obviously Robert misunderstands. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that. Did you think I didn&rsquo;t know? People like to talk. So Lady Dayne really committed suicide because of a broken heart.&rdquo; He shakes his head and his sadness is genuine. Probably the idea of \u200b\u200bthat tragic love reminds him of his own. &ldquo;Poor girl.&rdquo;</p><p>A gurgling verse elicits yet another smile. It is amazing to watch the change, the chasing of lights and shadows on the corners of his angular face. The fierce warrior tamed by a child. Robert touches the delicate and frail curve of Jon&rsquo;s skull. Ned thinks of Aegon Targaryen, of little Rhaenys, of the bloody end of Elia Martell. Of a mad king murdered by one of the knights who had sworn to serve him. Betrayals and oaths, achievements and secrets.</p><p>&ldquo;I can legitimize him,&rdquo; insists Robert. &ldquo;I can give him a title, recognize him as his father&rsquo;s son. You don&rsquo;t need to take responsibility for him, atone for a sin not yours.&rdquo;</p><p>On the contrary, the sin is also his. He didn&rsquo;t arrive in time. He failed to save Lyanna. He sighs and that simple gesture seems to deprive him of any residual energy. He feels incredibly tired and old. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; He asks. &ldquo;You said that Jon would destroy my marriage. What about yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; echoes Robert&rsquo;s voice, starstruck. &ldquo;You fucking bastard. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to call one of my boys like that.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Me too</i>. &ldquo;Answer the question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to say? I will never love any woman as I loved Lyanna, but my wife will be queen. This will have to be enough and she will have to accept Jon Stark, whether she likes it or not.&rdquo;</p><p>He knows it&rsquo;s a gamble. He should prevent it from happening. Make excuses.</p><p>Robert continues to smile at the son of the man he hates. The man he killed for revenge and to pay off a debt of pride.</p><p>He is trapped.</p><p><i>Lyanna, forgive me.</i></p><p>*</p><p>The news travels fast, carried by raven&rsquo;s wings propelled by strong winds.</p><p>The new King has a ward. An orphan and a bastard whom he has already legitimized.</p><p>When he returns home, Ned is a changed man, hopelessly different from the man he was before he left for the war. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he? The war took away everything from him. His father, his brother, his sister. His honor.</p><p>He returns to discover that Benjen intends to take the black and that his mother has slowly gone out, the most romantic say for the heartbreak of having survived the death of her family. But he knew her, strengths and weaknesses. It wasn&rsquo;t despair and mourning that killed her, but anger, bitterness, a burning hatred. His mother was a strong and passionate woman, but even the hardest stone can break under the right pressure.</p><p>He comes back to discover that his wife, whose colors he knows, but not the most intimate thoughts, meanwhile gave birth to a male child. A healthy and robust child. She called him Robb and he thinks he loves her a little for that.</p><p>In the chambers that belonged to his father and mother and which now belong to him and Catelyn, Ned holds his first child. Blood of his blood. Partly Stark partly Tully.</p><p>Motherhood has made Catelyn radiant. It made her flourish again. She must miss terribly the great rivers and the expanses of grass covered with dew, the exterminated fields, the wild flowers. A part of her must hate this hard and cold land where nothing pretty grows, where everything is white or dark, covered with moss.</p><p>She&rsquo;s trying to adapt. She wants to learn to be happy here with him. She set aside the elaborate braids and garments with gaudy tones. Now she is the portrait of sobriety and composure. Only her hair shines like red gold against the fire in the fireplace and so does Robb&rsquo;s.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t welcome him with a hug, but when they were alone and he sought the reassuring warmth of her body, she let him attract her against him and reciprocated his embrace with equal force.</p><p>I&rsquo;m home, he thought. This is my home now.</p><p>While nursing Robb, Catelyn is careful to ask general questions about the South, about Robert. Neither of them speak of the deads, the spoils of war. Nevertheless the argument cannot be avoided. When he mentions Jon Stark, he sees the pain in his wife&rsquo;s sky blue eyes and can&rsquo;t stand it. In his case it would have been humiliation and wounded pride. In Brandon&rsquo;s case it is something profoundly different. No matter how, Catelyn loved him. Discovering that she has been betrayed remains a severe blow, a sour bite to swallow. She reacts stoically, but her features are expressionless, her eyes cold and dry, her shoulders stiff, the crease of her thin mouth is decidedly unhappy.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to build the foundation of their marriage on a lie.</p><p>In another situation he would have acted differently. Not in this one. In this Jon has already been lost and he failed to protect him as he should have.</p><p>He kneels in front of his wife and taking her hand, in a broken whisper, briefly tells her about a bed soaked with blood and the last words of a beloved sister lost in the worst way, the forbidden love of a wolf and a dragon, of a child guilty only of being born on the side of the losers at the end of a war that made him an orphan.</p><p>In the end, Ned isn&rsquo;t the only one crying.</p><p>Robb has fallen asleep and his small face is placid and blissful.</p><p>Catelyn looks devastated. &ldquo;Oh, Ned,&rdquo; she whispers softly. She puts her hand against his cheek and he turns his head to kiss her palm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he hears her say. &ldquo;Tell me what I can do. How can I help you.&rdquo;</p><p>There are traces of dry tears on her pale cheeks and new tears are accumulated against her dark eyelashes. She has never seemed more beautiful to him. He has never been so close to feeling something like this. Not a violent passion, but an affection of a piercing, disruptive sweetness that seems to fill the cracks inside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Bear the burden with me,&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;Keep the secret and swear by my gods and yours to never reveal it to anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiles, sad and resolute. She smooths with a finger the worry lines between his eyebrows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Stark secret and I&rsquo;m a Stark now. We&rsquo;re in this together.&rdquo;</p><p>ii</p><p>The King&rsquo;s arrival is welcomed by the procession of the inhabitants of Winterfell gathered in the inner courtyard. It is a triumph of opulence that clashes all the more openly with the austerity of the castle. The Starks are in the front row.</p><p>Ned kneels before Robert and pronounces the usual words, hiding a smile little and badly.</p><p>Robert&rsquo;s eyes betray the same mirth. When he tells him to get up and crush him in a bear hug, he finds in the fat and rowdy man who stands in front of him his oldest and dearest friend.</p><p>The necessary introductions are made. Only a few moments seem to have elapsed when Robert slips his hand below the belt and declares that he wants to go down into the crypts.</p><p>Ned has no choice but to obey.</p><p>He leads the way, after exchanging a look of understanding with Catelyn. Her eyes leave his to stare at a point behind him and he sees a flash of surprise crossing over her face.</p><p>He takes a moment too long to understand and it happens when Robert says, the surliness swept away by a hint of rude kindness, &ldquo;Come with us, boy. I want you to see her. It&rsquo;s your aunt after all.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s the first time he sees his nephew after fourteen years and gods, the resemblance is impressive.</p><p>The shape of the mouth is that of Brandon, only that while his brother&rsquo;s was prone to grins, Jon&rsquo;s seems perpetually sullen, so as the thick and frowned eyebrows are those of his mother.</p><p>The penetrating gray cloud eyes are entirely Lyanna and the way he moves, with determination yet light, reminds him of other ghosts. He is a Stark in every way. There is nothing of his father in him and he knows he must be grateful.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; he says and doesn&rsquo;t know whether to hug him. He is at an age when such gestures are perceived with aversion. It&rsquo;s the same with Robb.</p><p>Jon must read his indecision because he smiles with his eyes, squeezing them slightly as Benjen does when he tries to hold back a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; he greets him with a nod and without another word follows Robert.</p><p>*</p><p>That night, embracing Catelyn in their bed, they comment on their respective days as usual. It&rsquo;s an old habit.</p><p>&ldquo;Rodrick said that during the training Jon disarmed Robb three times.&rdquo; She has her head resting on his shoulder and he caresses her long loose hair, passing it between his fingers like silk ribbons.</p><p>Ned chuckles. &ldquo;I can imagine Robb&rsquo;s reaction.&rdquo;</p><p>Catelyn lightly hits him on the arm. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to laugh about. You know how he becomes when he loses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to talk to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re kids.&rdquo; She sighs. &ldquo;They are growing. Let them\u00a0sort things out for themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence that follows is comfortable and relaxing. &ldquo;He resembles her,&rdquo; he mutters in thought. He doesn&rsquo;t need to specify who he is referring to.</p><p>Catelyn is strangely silent. &ldquo;He looks just like you,&rdquo; she finally says with her eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;He looks more like you than your children.&rdquo;</p><p>The idea seems to disturb her. It&rsquo;s true. Among the kids only Arya has inherited his look, the Stark look, but these are mere physical similarities. Robb is stubborn and self-confident, as pungent and charismatic as Brandon was. Sansa and Arya painfully remind him of Lyanna, each in a different way. Bran is reckless and curious, as cheerful as Benjen. Rickon is still too young for him to express an opinion on his character.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it irritate you?&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t respond immediately. Her hand is tight around his tunic, near the heart. She raises her head to look into his eyes. &ldquo;Do you ever think what it would have been like if you had brought him here and raised him as your bastard? If you hadn&rsquo;t told me the truth?&rdquo; He also hears the questions she doesn&rsquo;t dare to pronounce. <i>Do you think we would be where we are now, like this? Would I be able to forgive you for betraying me? Would I have the strength to love you anyway?</i></p><p>He touches her forehead with his lips. &ldquo;Every day,&rdquo; he admits.</p><p>iii</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t the first time that Robert disappoints him, but it is the first time he discovers he cannot forgive him. Sansa&rsquo;s shattering sobs, the anguished way she is embracing her direwolf would melt a heart of stone. Not that of the Queen, nor that of the King, apparently.</p><p>Ned passes an arm around Sansa&rsquo;s shoulders, trying to convince her to let go Lady, but Sansa is stubborn, just like Catelyn and hers is an iron grip. Arya has already run away, probably went to hole up in some corner to cry the tears she held back from the moment the Hound entered the tent with a bloody sword decreeing Mycah&rsquo;s death.</p><p>Ned knows what to do, even if the thought fills him with revulsion.</p><p>Then it happens.</p><p>Jon steps forward and kneels in front of Robert. No matter how awkward he may appear, he moves with lethal grace. Ned saw him sparring, saw the easy camaraderie he established with Robb during his stay in Winterfell (his son is impulsive and impetuous and proud, but he knows how to recognize his mistakes and after the first defeats, it was him who sought Jon&rsquo;s company, who asked him to train together), he knows that even the Kingslayer takes pleasure in their swordplay. Looking at the inflexible line of his back, Ned doesn&rsquo;t know what to think. He doesn&rsquo;t understand Jon, he doesn&rsquo;t know him. His nephew, with his silences and the constant frown that never leaves his forehead. His nephew who always wears black and brown leathers. Introverted, but not shy. Usually a boy of few words, a silent\u00a0observer.</p><p>&ldquo;Your grace,&rdquo; Jon says, his head dutifully bowed, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m allowed to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it, boy,&rdquo; replies Robert, but there is no real bite in his cursing, only blatant fondness. &ldquo;Every time this spiel of\u00a0obsequious banter. If you want to talk, then talk. You don&rsquo;t have to ask my permission.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon gets up with a fluid movement and when he talks it&rsquo;s like hearing Lyanna, her incurable thirst for justice. &ldquo;Lady Sansa&rsquo;s direwolf is innocent and so was the boy. This is not the King&rsquo;s justice. It is only revenge ruled by anger.&rdquo;</p><p>Robert runs his hand over his beard, listening intently. Standing at his side the Queen&rsquo;s eyes are reduced to two slits yet she remains silent, even if she stares at Jon with open hostility.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you propose, boy? My queen wants blood. She is a fierce lioness and one of her cubs was wounded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scars are what make a man a warrior. Scars like that&hellip;&rdquo; Jon looks in the direction of Joffrey, of his bandaged arm. There is no scorn in his tone, but Ned holds his breath because the meaning behind the words is unmistakable. &ldquo;Any man would show them off with pride. However, he is the prince and he was injured. What happened, regardless of how it happened, is unforgivable. Since the Queen asks for the head of a direwolf, I propose an exchange. Spare that of Lady Sansa and take mine instead.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence and tension are as dense as the morning fog.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon, no,&rdquo; a broken voice whines behind him and Ned catches Sansa&rsquo;s guilty and striken expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asks Robert. &ldquo;There's\u00a0no coming back from\u00a0that.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon merely nods. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; says Robert. &ldquo;Ned, see that the sentence is executed. Now go away and leave me alone, all of you. I&rsquo;ve had enough of you troublemakers.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Later, after it&rsquo;s over, Ned watches Jon cover the remains of Ghost with his cloak. The boy&rsquo;s expression is closed and indecipherable.</p><p>Ned puts a hand on his shoulder and is surprised when Jon allows it. He&rsquo;s probably too distracted by what happened and hasn&rsquo;t even noticed it.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bury him in the north,&rdquo; he promises.</p><p>This seems to awaken Jon. He blinks. &ldquo;I wish for him to be buried with Lady Lyanna.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned must fight against the sudden lump in his throat before speaking. &ldquo;It will be done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Queen will not be satisfied,&rdquo; Jon says after a moment. &ldquo;You have to send Lady away. Get her back to Winterfell. There she will be safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned had hoped that was the end, but he realizes that it was foolish of him to think so. Death calls for death, blood wants more blood. He&rsquo;s just surprised that Jon, so young, has already learned this lesson. Not for the first time, he wonders what Jon had to endure, the kind of childhood he had.</p><p>What happened in the King&rsquo;s tent, the exchange of words and looks he witnessed. He lets the hand fall to his side. What right does he have to comfort Lyanna&rsquo;s boy right now? </p><p>&ldquo;In there,&rdquo; he says and Jon turns. &ldquo;You knew what would happen.&rdquo;</p><p>It is clear that Jon knows what he is referring to by the way he avoids his gaze and is mulling over how to respond, weighing the words and deciding what to admit.</p><p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t my family, but I grew up with them,&rdquo; he says and it is a painful, bitter truth. A purulent and rodent wound just as much for him as it must be for Jon. Lyanna&rsquo;s eyes stare at him from his grave face, accusers and sad, as if they knew, as if he understood the extent of his guilt. <i>How did you protect him? How did you keep your oath? Throwing him to the lions</i>.</p><p>The moment passes. Jon shrugs, unperturbed. &ldquo;I know how they think, what they feel. Sometimes it seems like I know them more and better than I know myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned thinks back to the time when in the crypts, after Robert&rsquo;s proposal to join their families, Jon didn&rsquo;t immediately follow the King. He stared intently at Lyanna&rsquo;s sculpted face while Ned thought, <i>you won&rsquo;t know the sound of her laughter. You will never hear her sing to robins. You will not know of the pranks she used to play at\u00a0the expense of lords and servants, how her laughter was able to dissolve any resentment or animosity towards her afterwards, making her earn forgiveness and love from anyone who knew her.</i></p><p>Jon advised him to wait. An engagement is for life. He remembers what he told him as if not a single day had passed, so deeply it struck him. &ldquo;Let them know each other, let them fall in love. Let them live the fairy tale. Give her a choice. Make her choose to get married because that&rsquo;s what she wants and not what she thinks she wants.&rdquo;</p><p>He knows Joffrey&rsquo;s temperament, he knows how he is. It is as he said. He grew up with them. Those people are not his family, but he knows how they think, how they behave.</p><p>He averted a catastrophe. After what he saw, he will never consent to a marriage between Sansa and Joffrey Baratheon.</p><p>iv</p><p>&ldquo;The boy can&rsquo;t become King,&rdquo; says Robert. He refused the milk of poppy. His face is swollen and red, veiled with sweat. He has a fever. The wound infected and must hurt like seven hells. Nevertheless he seems lucid and more than ever like the man he loved as a boy, not the dissolute and careless King he has known in recent months.</p><p>In light of the discovery about the real parentage of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, Ned says nothing.</p><p>Robert punches the mattress. &ldquo;Joffrey,&rdquo; he says his son&rsquo;s name as if it tasted disgusting, as if he wanted to spit it out. &ldquo;He cannot be King. He isn&rsquo;t suitable. He doesn&rsquo;t have the makings for governing.&rdquo; He twitches the eyes and it seems that the pain is getting worse because he is panting\u00a0heavily. &ldquo;Jon was right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; What does Jon have to do with all this?</p><p>Robert opens his eyes instantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good boy. Diligent. Quiet. Well-mannered. He looks more like you than his father.&rdquo; He bursts out laughing and as often happens is a laugh at the expense of the world, for a joke he doesn&rsquo;t intend to share, which only he seems capable of fully understanding. &ldquo;A year ago he tried to talk to me. He wanted to convince me to issue an edict to name Tommen as crown prince. Obviously I didn&rsquo;t listen to him. You should have seen him, Ned.&rdquo; The smile that curves his mouth, supplanting the grimace of pain, is a smile that Ned remembers well. It has the taste of youth, of spring, of tournaments and winter roses, of dances and banquets.</p><p>&ldquo;It was like she was talking to me. Lyanna. He had exactly her look. Do you remember her look? When she stuck to something and wanted to convince you to think the same way at all costs. It made you feel like slime in the channels, like she was ready to hit you if you dared to contradict her.&rdquo; Robert&rsquo;s eyes are shiny and wistful. &ldquo;May the gods forgive me. I loved the boy as a son, more than my own. For years I imagined that he was her boy&rsquo;s, the son that she would have given me if everything had gone as it should have been. I saw him grow up and it was like seeing you and her again, mixed up. He would be a good King, a great one. He doesn&rsquo;t have my blood and he has no right to the crown, but if I could I would recognize him as my heir right now.&rdquo;</p><p>But he has it, Ned thinks. He could be King and he would have more right than those you consider your children.</p><p>&ldquo;He would hate it.&rdquo; Robert bursts out laughing again. He holds his chest with both hands as if it hurt, but he doesn&rsquo;t stop laughing. It only ends when he is out of breath. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;He would hate it like I did. Like he hates this place. I wronged him. I should have send him north years ago. I was fucking selfish, but I loved him. As much as I loved her. My Queen of Love and Beauty.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>After his offer to let her and the children survive, when Cersei asks the inevitable question, the answers could be multiple. Honor, which requires not to claim innocent victims. Mercy, because now he can imagine precisely how difficult life must have been as the wife and queen of Robert. In the end the truth prevails. &ldquo;For Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She frowns. She is a beautiful woman and if Robert had been a better man, a man capable of letting go the past and above all the idealized image of a dead girl, perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to have this conversation now, to do what the duty towards his king and the realm impose on him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been kind to him. He has every reason to hate me. If he knew what you discovered-&rdquo;</p><p>And this is perhaps the most difficult part. To know that the boy he had sworn to protect grew up in this nest of vipers. Lonely because of the King&rsquo;s love. Far away from the affection of the family that would have welcomed him and loved him, not a perfect love, but as indestructible as the Wall, vast and deep as the depths of the sea.</p><p>&ldquo;He already knows,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;He always knew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ridiculous,&rdquo; she says scornfully, but the doubt is sprouting. He can see the cracks in her mask, in her demeanor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He hindered Jon Arryn&rsquo;s research and he was the one who covered you for years. He made sure that Robert&rsquo;s bastards left the city discreetly, paying to cover their escape. The only one left is a blacksmith and just because I beat him to it.&rdquo;</p><p>Now she seems distraught. &ldquo;Why should he have?&rdquo; She isn&rsquo;t looking at him, as if the question was addressed more to herself than to him. As if she had forgotten his presence, the sword hanging over her head, so great and shocking is the surprise of what he told her.</p><p>Even if this is the case, he answers the same, feeling his heart break exactly like the first time he put the threads together, at Robert&rsquo;s deathbed, &ldquo;Because you are the only mother he has known for all his life and through you he discovered a woman&rsquo;s love for her children, even if was never directed towards him.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>The cell where they locked him up is dark and cold. He survived worse things. The only torture is not knowing what happened to Sansa and Arya. And Jon. </p><p><i>Gods, what have I done?</i></p><p>After what he told the Queen, there is no way he can have survived. At best he was thrown into a cell similar to his.</p><p>When the door opens, hours, days, months later, Ned has to shield his eyes. The light of the torch that one of the two men has in his hand is blinding. He cannot make out their faces, only the blurred contours of their figures.</p><p>The taller man gives the torch to the other and kneels beside him. &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; he says and for the first time in years Ned feels like he might cry.</p><p>He tries to talk, but all he can produce is a strangled cry. His mouth is dry, his lips like leaves about to crumble.</p><p>He tries again and croaks, &ldquo;Sansa? Arya?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fine,&rdquo; Jon reassures him and hands him a wineskin. Ned drinks greedily as Jon continues to update him on recent events, &ldquo;Arya disappeared the day you were imprisoned. She must have escaped. Sansa,&rdquo; Jon hesitates imperceptibly, avoiding his gaze, &ldquo;she is fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned grabs him by the wrist. &ldquo;What are you not telling me?&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment it looks like Jon doesn&rsquo;t want to tell him. Whatever it is, he doesn&rsquo;t like it. No matter how terrible it is, he wants to know, he must. Jon seems to understand because he nods slowly. He turns to the second man and finally Ned recognizes him.</p><p>Lord Varys comes forward and begins to speak, revealing what Jon would have preferred to keep to himself, &ldquo;This morning Lady Sansa implored the King to spare you and the King graciously consented for the sincere love that binds him to your daughter. He will pardon you and allow you to join the Night&rsquo;s Watch, as long as you admit your betrayal to the whole Court and that Joffrey is the true King. As a friend, I strongly advise you to accept the offer. Doing so would protect your daughter. She could even be queen one day.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what worries and disgusts him more, if the shame that Sansa pleaded for him, kneeling at the foot of the iron throne in an attempt to save him or that one day she could be married to the monster that is Joffrey Lannister.</p><p>His opinion on the matter must be evident because Lord Varys sighs, a sigh of regret, as if with it he wants to express that despite everything he tried and that if he failed the fault is not attributable to him.</p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t pardon you,&rdquo; Jon says unexpectedly.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; He asks without thinking. Then remember who he&rsquo;s talking to.</p><p>The smile that Jon gives him is empty and doesn&rsquo;t reach his eyes.<i> Because I know him,</i> he is saying. <i>Because I grew up with him. Because I know things you don&rsquo;t know and you&rsquo;ll never know.</i></p><p>Ned takes his head in his hands. For the first time in his life he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do, what to say. All he can think of is that he will die. It&rsquo;s a matter of hours, maybe days. He feels no fear, only regret. The regret of leaving Sansa alone and helpless and practically ad a captive of the Lannister. The regret of not seeing Catelyn again and not seeing the boys grow up. The regret of not having a future, of not being able to savor the old age they had dreamed of, gray and old and surrounded by grandchildren. There is a regret, however, that he can remedy. A thorn deep in his heart and that he could finally eliminate.</p><p>&ldquo;Your mother-&rdquo; begins and maybe it&rsquo;s an impression, but Jon looks pale, his face white as bone. He&rsquo;s just a boy, he thinks suddenly. I shouldn&rsquo;t give him this burden. He isn&rsquo;t ready, not yet. After all, the secret will not die with him. Catelyn is the next keeper.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jon interrupts him firmly, but not without a certain amount of kindness.</p><p>He knows? &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know I grew up thinking I was your son?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like Jon to answer a question with another question. However, the absurdity of what he has just said makes his mind white and bleakly empty.</p><p>He looks just like you, Ned recalls Catelyn&rsquo;s voice. More than your children.</p><p>He would like for it to be true. He would like not to have accepted Robert&rsquo;s proposal and would have liked to have torn him from his arms with force, to hell with the consequences. He would like Jon to have grown up in Winterfell, protected, loved, safe. He would like hundreds of things, but here, at the mouth of the seven hells, while death looks him in the face through the eyes of his sister, he cannot lie.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your father,&rdquo; he says, every word scratching his throat.</p><p>Jon looks at his hands, his face in shadow. &ldquo;Now I know.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t sound surprised. &ldquo;I knew since I met you. Since I saw how you treat your children. I&rsquo;m trying to be honest because-&rdquo; he swallows, running out of words.</p><p>Ned has never seen him so nervous, agitated. Even when he lost his direwolf he didn&rsquo;t react this way. Jon is usually calm, prudent, cautious. Not right now. He appears young and worried, as if he isn&rsquo;t the master of his emotions and the newness destabilizes him, makes him uncertain about how to proceed.</p><p>Ned lets him regain control. He feels he owes him at least this. Ti decide how he want to face the truth about himself. The choice is his. He will respect it, whatever it is. Not for duty or honor, but because it is right.</p><p>&ldquo;Growing up with this face, knowing that I looked more like you than my supposed father&hellip;&rdquo; Jon takes a deep breath and meets his gaze with the expression of someone about to face a battle. &ldquo;The King liked to talk about your years together in the Vale. Lord Arryn would have preferred him to do it more discreetly. I never understood why he didn&rsquo;t like me, until one day I did. I understood. He believed what everyone believed. That you were my real father and that to cover up your disgrace you had asked Robert to help you. A loophole. For years I believed you were my father, that you couldn&rsquo;t bear my sight to the point of praying the King to take me as ward. I thought of you, in your castle of stone and snow, picturing how it would be like to have brothers and sisters, if you loved me at least a little or if I was just that to you, the perpetual memory of a moment of weakness, of your shame.&rdquo;</p><p><i>My dear boy. What have I done?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Robert legitimized you,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Jon nods, but it&rsquo;s a gesture with no real meaning. &ldquo;A bastard remains a bastard even with a different name. I&rsquo;ve never been a Stark, not really, otherwise why would I have been forced to grow up here? Even if it wasn&rsquo;t an exile, it seemed like that to me.&rdquo;</p><p>When he is silent, obsessively staring at the wall, Ned observes his shining eyes and feels overcome by impotence, by a raw despair, a roaring wrath.</p><p>&ldquo;During the tournament in your honor I met Edric Dayne,&rdquo; Jon continues to talk. &ldquo;He is Lord Dondarrion&rsquo;s squire. He seemed surprised by my questions about Lady Ashara. He couldn&rsquo;t understand the reasons. He was convinced that my mother&rsquo;s name was Wylla. She was his wet nurse. He told me we were milk brothers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was also yours for a short time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to think anymore.&rdquo; Jon runs his hand through his hair. Ned can imagine what he must have felt, the frustration of not knowing and the need to discover the truth, vital and necessary. &ldquo;By then I was sure you weren&rsquo;t my father. I knew you. I had seen the kind of man you were. Isn&rsquo;t it ironic?&rdquo; Jon laughs. It sounds depressing, bitterly disappointed. &ldquo;When I wanted you to be my father, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t possible. I wasn&rsquo;t yours, so I really had to be Brandon&rsquo;s son. My mother&rsquo;s mystery remained. Who was she? I wrote to Lady Allyria Dayne. She confirmed my suspicions. Her sister had given birth during the Rebellion, it was true, but a stillborn, a girl. Wylla had been my nurse, she loved me like a mother, but she didn&rsquo;t give birth to me. I wasn&rsquo;t who I thought I was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have written her,&rdquo; he reproaches him more forcefully than strictly necessary. &ldquo;It was a risky and dangerous move. What would have happened if someone had intercepted the missive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have the means,&rdquo; Jon responds, minimizing, but his eyes unknowingly move to the left, where Lord Varys is. </p><p><i>Since when? When did you start weaving plots and collaborating with the Spider?</i></p><p>He isn&rsquo;t surprised, not really. Jon&rsquo;s fate was marked from the moment he was forced to grow up at court under the King&rsquo;s protection. And what protection was it? It isn&rsquo;t a shield, something that has protected him from the whispers, from the looks. A name doesn&rsquo;t make you less alone when the only boys you grow up with are cruel and derisive and the others too small to understand what is happening, to act. When the adults around you consider you a burden, a stain, something to eradicate. When the only adult who shows you affection is too distracted by the past to pay attention to the present. What can you do if not train yourself to the bone and become a skilled swordsman with Lord Barristan to fill endless afternoons that you wouldn&rsquo;t know how to spend otherwise? To study and beating yourself up you to show that you are worthy of respect, for them to leave you alone?</p><p>&ldquo;I have the Stark traits, I was given the name Stark, but I&rsquo;m not your son, I&rsquo;m not Brandon&rsquo;s son. There is another brother, but he is in the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Fifteen years ago, you came back from Dorne with a child, along with a wet nurse named Wylla and the bones of your sister, after you\u00a0smashed a tower to pieces. Say it,&rdquo; he orders with a look that could cut. &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s name. Say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyanna Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Targaryen,&rdquo; he corrects him. &ldquo;Lady Dayne wrote something else. Apparently I was never a bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s too much information. After days of silence and darkness, it&rsquo;s happening too much and too fast. He can&rsquo;t reason. He massages his temple. &ldquo;Why are you telling me all this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To give you the opportunity to redeem yourself and do something right. They will kill you. Joffrey may have agreed to pardon you this afternoon, but if it is not today, it will be tomorrow or another day. He will change his mind and go back on his word because that&rsquo;s what he does, what he likes. You know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p><p>Yes. Yes, he knows. He learned it the hard way. &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell the truth. Say what you discovered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is honor also in the way we die.

            "comment": "<p><b>The flight of youth</b></p><p>(AU in which Jon grows up in King\u2019s Landing as Robert\u2019s ward and Brandon\u2019s legitimized bastard.)</p><p>i</p><p>Ned strides out of the Tower of Joy, a screaming child into his arms and the smell of his sister\u2019s blood marked upon his skin.</p><p>He rides day and night, the only stops are those to allow the wet nurse to feed the child. He has no name, not yet.</p><p><i>Raise him like he\u2019s yours. Protect him.</i> These were Lyanna\u2019s last words. It\u2019s what he promised and he will do.</p><p>Thoughts assail him in moments of forced quiet, in slumber, gnawing at his soul like rats.</p><p>During the night, when everything is dark and there is no glimmer of light, the burden of the secret and the consequences of his promise weigh heavily on his mind.</p><p>What will people think when they see him return after the war with a bastard in his arms? What will Catelyn think?</p><p>The thought of his wife, of the fragile hopes he had placed in their marriage, the feeling that they had reached an understanding, the certainty of being able to build something together little by little. If not love, at least a relationship of friendship, respect, trust, devotion.</p><p>He keenly feels the loss of what could have been and never will be.</p><p>*</p><p>His precautions don\u2019t matter. In the end Robert tracks him.</p><p>(Two days ago he arrived at King\u2019s Landing to find the Mad King in a pool of his own blood, to discover the cruel brutality of Elia Martell and her sons deaths.)</p><p>He is not ready, he never will be. Lying is difficult for him. Lying to the boy with whom he grew up and that is like a brother to him seems impossible. It\u2019s dishonorable and wrong, but he knows Robert and knows that Lyanna\u2019s fear was legitimate. If Robert had the slightest doubt, if he suspected something, it would be the end. It would mean fury and ruin. Too much blood has already been spilled.</p><p>Now or never, he thinks.</p><p>Robert observes the child in his arms and for the first time in the last year it seems that the storm raging at the bottom of his clear eyes subsides. The frenzy that not even Raeghar\u2019s death managed to extinguish disappears, buried behind the shadow of a smile that peeks out from his long and bristly beard.</p><p>Ned lets Robert take the child and already feels the absence of his familiar weight against the chest, similar to an amputation.</p><p>He watches as he cradle him, a small and screaming bundle pressed against a mighty chest. Robert still wears his armor and is covered in mud and encrusted blood. Jon doesn\u2019t seem to care. He stops crying and in the sudden silence the ringing in his ears becomes the only noise inside the tent. He feels suffocated. The scorching sun of Dorne is far away and so are the desert lands that he has crossed like a man damned by the gods. If he closes his eyes, however, he can still feel the stifling heat of the room in which he found Lyanna, the stench of death.</p><p>\u201cCat will never accept him,\u201d says Robert. He\u2019s tickling Jon\u2019s chin. \u201cThis will destroy your marriage.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the truth and perhaps it was the awareness of this that stole his sleep and peace. Not the memory of the dead, but the torment of the living, knowing the battle that awaits him within the walls of his house.</p><p>\u201cGive him to me, Ned. Give me your boy and I\u2019ll raise him as if he were mine. He will be my ward. The war took Lyanna from me. I won the war for a wolf.\u201d</p><p>He wakes up from a nightmare to find himself catapulted into another.</p><p>Now he recognizes the exalted and euphoric expression on Robert\u2019s face and hates himself for not immediately noticing. It is the same expression with which he looked at Lyanna, all possessive and fierce tenderness. Lyanna who hated conventions, the restrictions of being a woman. Lyanna who was free and wild and indomitable, but had a kind heart and always dreamed of great adventures, great loves, to live the stories of her favorite books, to become like the heroes of her songs. Lyanna who loved to dance and ride. Lyanna who died, entrusting him with her most precious thing. He is pervaded by an absolute, blinding rage. It is the injustice of everything that has happened to his family. One misfortune after another. And after all that grief, now <i>this</i>.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a trophy, Robert,\u201d he says and his voice sounds bitter and terrifying. \u201cIt\u2019s the life of a child you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019ve sworn to protect him, to keep him safe. On his mother\u2019s deathbed, I-\u201d he stops abruptly for the horror of what he has just let slip in the heat of the moment. The emotions that have taken over, obscuring the reason. He knows he must have gone pale.</p><p>Robert doesn\u2019t flinch. He must have noticed his tension as he must have noticed the suspicious way he stopped talking suddenly.</p><p><i>Gods, let him not understand. Gods, you aren\u2019t always just and forgiving. You haven\u2019t been with Lyanna. Be with her son.</i></p><p>\u201cTell me the truth.\u201d Robert\u2019s gaze is open and inquisitive, it seems to pierce him apart. \u201cHe isn\u2019t yours, is it?\u201d Then, like a bolt from the blue, in a thoughtful and unusually serious tone, he asks, \u201cIs he Brandon\u2019s bastard?\u201d</p><p>His surprise twines indissolubly with relief. He thanks all the existing gods, old and new and those who are strangers to him and who have altars of fire, gold and horse bones beyond the Narrow Sea.</p><p>Obviously Robert misunderstands. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. Did you think I didn\u2019t know? People like to talk. So Lady Dayne really committed suicide because of a broken heart.\u201d He shakes his head and his sadness is genuine. Probably the idea of \u200b\u200bthat tragic love reminds him of his own. \u201cPoor girl.\u201d</p><p>A gurgling verse elicits yet another smile. It is amazing to watch the change, the chasing of lights and shadows on the corners of his angular face. The fierce warrior tamed by a child. Robert touches the delicate and frail curve of Jon\u2019s skull. Ned thinks of Aegon Targaryen, of little Rhaenys, of the bloody end of Elia Martell. Of a mad king murdered by one of the knights who had sworn to serve him. Betrayals and oaths, achievements and secrets.</p><p>\u201cI can legitimize him,\u201d insists Robert. \u201cI can give him a title, recognize him as his father\u2019s son. You don\u2019t need to take responsibility for him, atone for a sin not yours.\u201d</p><p>On the contrary, the sin is also his. He didn\u2019t arrive in time. He failed to save Lyanna. He sighs and that simple gesture seems to deprive him of any residual energy. He feels incredibly tired and old. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d He asks. \u201cYou said that Jon would destroy my marriage. What about yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d echoes Robert\u2019s voice, starstruck. \u201cYou fucking bastard. I\u2019ve always wanted to call one of my boys like that.\u201d</p><p><i>Me too</i>. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? I will never love any woman as I loved Lyanna, but my wife will be queen. This will have to be enough and she will have to accept Jon Stark, whether she likes it or not.\u201d</p><p>He knows it\u2019s a gamble. He should prevent it from happening. Make excuses.</p><p>Robert continues to smile at the son of the man he hates. The man he killed for revenge and to pay off a debt of pride.</p><p>He is trapped.</p><p><i>Lyanna, forgive me.</i></p><p>*</p><p>The news travels fast, carried by raven\u2019s wings propelled by strong winds.</p><p>The new King has a ward. An orphan and a bastard whom he has already legitimized.</p><p>When he returns home, Ned is a changed man, hopelessly different from the man he was before he left for the war. Why shouldn\u2019t he? The war took away everything from him. His father, his brother, his sister. His honor.</p><p>He returns to discover that Benjen intends to take the black and that his mother has slowly gone out, the most romantic say for the heartbreak of having survived the death of her family. But he knew her, strengths and weaknesses. It wasn\u2019t despair and mourning that killed her, but anger, bitterness, a burning hatred. His mother was a strong and passionate woman, but even the hardest stone can break under the right pressure.</p><p>He comes back to discover that his wife, whose colors he knows, but not the most intimate thoughts, meanwhile gave birth to a male child. A healthy and robust child. She called him Robb and he thinks he loves her a little for that.</p><p>In the chambers that belonged to his father and mother and which now belong to him and Catelyn, Ned holds his first child. Blood of his blood. Partly Stark partly Tully.</p><p>Motherhood has made Catelyn radiant. It made her flourish again. She must miss terribly the great rivers and the expanses of grass covered with dew, the exterminated fields, the wild flowers. A part of her must hate this hard and cold land where nothing pretty grows, where everything is white or dark, covered with moss.</p><p>She\u2019s trying to adapt. She wants to learn to be happy here with him. She set aside the elaborate braids and garments with gaudy tones. Now she is the portrait of sobriety and composure. Only her hair shines like red gold against the fire in the fireplace and so does Robb\u2019s.</p><p>She didn\u2019t welcome him with a hug, but when they were alone and he sought the reassuring warmth of her body, she let him attract her against him and reciprocated his embrace with equal force.</p><p>I\u2019m home, he thought. This is my home now.</p><p>While nursing Robb, Catelyn is careful to ask general questions about the South, about Robert. Neither of them speak of the deads, the spoils of war. Nevertheless the argument cannot be avoided. When he mentions Jon Stark, he sees the pain in his wife\u2019s sky blue eyes and can\u2019t stand it. In his case it would have been humiliation and wounded pride. In Brandon\u2019s case it is something profoundly different. No matter how, Catelyn loved him. Discovering that she has been betrayed remains a severe blow, a sour bite to swallow. She reacts stoically, but her features are expressionless, her eyes cold and dry, her shoulders stiff, the crease of her thin mouth is decidedly unhappy.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to build the foundation of their marriage on a lie.</p><p>In another situation he would have acted differently. Not in this one. In this Jon has already been lost and he failed to protect him as he should have.</p><p>He kneels in front of his wife and taking her hand, in a broken whisper, briefly tells her about a bed soaked with blood and the last words of a beloved sister lost in the worst way, the forbidden love of a wolf and a dragon, of a child guilty only of being born on the side of the losers at the end of a war that made him an orphan.</p><p>In the end, Ned isn\u2019t the only one crying.</p><p>Robb has fallen asleep and his small face is placid and blissful.</p><p>Catelyn looks devastated. \u201cOh, Ned,\u201d she whispers softly. She puts her hand against his cheek and he turns his head to kiss her palm. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he hears her say. \u201cTell me what I can do. How can I help you.\u201d</p><p>There are traces of dry tears on her pale cheeks and new tears are accumulated against her dark eyelashes. She has never seemed more beautiful to him. He has never been so close to feeling something like this. Not a violent passion, but an affection of a piercing, disruptive sweetness that seems to fill the cracks inside him.</p><p>\u201cBear the burden with me,\u201d he answers. \u201cKeep the secret and swear by my gods and yours to never reveal it to anyone.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, sad and resolute. She smooths with a finger the worry lines between his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s a Stark secret and I\u2019m a Stark now. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>ii</p><p>The King\u2019s arrival is welcomed by the procession of the inhabitants of Winterfell gathered in the inner courtyard. It is a triumph of opulence that clashes all the more openly with the austerity of the castle. The Starks are in the front row.</p><p>Ned kneels before Robert and pronounces the usual words, hiding a smile little and badly.</p><p>Robert\u2019s eyes betray the same mirth. When he tells him to get up and crush him in a bear hug, he finds in the fat and rowdy man who stands in front of him his oldest and dearest friend.</p><p>The necessary introductions are made. Only a few moments seem to have elapsed when Robert slips his hand below the belt and declares that he wants to go down into the crypts.</p><p>Ned has no choice but to obey.</p><p>He leads the way, after exchanging a look of understanding with Catelyn. Her eyes leave his to stare at a point behind him and he sees a flash of surprise crossing over her face.</p><p>He takes a moment too long to understand and it happens when Robert says, the surliness swept away by a hint of rude kindness, \u201cCome with us, boy. I want you to see her. It\u2019s your aunt after all.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the first time he sees his nephew after fourteen years and gods, the resemblance is impressive.</p><p>The shape of the mouth is that of Brandon, only that while his brother\u2019s was prone to grins, Jon\u2019s seems perpetually sullen, so as the thick and frowned eyebrows are those of his mother.</p><p>The penetrating gray cloud eyes are entirely Lyanna and the way he moves, with determination yet light, reminds him of other ghosts. He is a Stark in every way. There is nothing of his father in him and he knows he must be grateful.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d he says and doesn\u2019t know whether to hug him. He is at an age when such gestures are perceived with aversion. It\u2019s the same with Robb.</p><p>Jon must read his indecision because he smiles with his eyes, squeezing them slightly as Benjen does when he tries to hold back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cUncle,\u201d he greets him with a nod and without another word follows Robert.</p><p>*</p><p>That night, embracing Catelyn in their bed, they comment on their respective days as usual. It\u2019s an old habit.</p><p>\u201cRodrick said that during the training Jon disarmed Robb three times.\u201d She has her head resting on his shoulder and he caresses her long loose hair, passing it between his fingers like silk ribbons.</p><p>Ned chuckles. \u201cI can imagine Robb\u2019s reaction.\u201d</p><p>Catelyn lightly hits him on the arm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to laugh about. You know how he becomes when he loses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re kids.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThey are growing. Let them\u00a0sort things out for themselves.\u201d</p><p>The silence that follows is comfortable and relaxing. \u201cHe resembles her,\u201d he mutters in thought. He doesn\u2019t need to specify who he is referring to.</p><p>Catelyn is strangely silent. \u201cHe looks just like you,\u201d she finally says with her eyebrows furrowed. \u201cHe looks more like you than your children.\u201d</p><p>The idea seems to disturb her. It\u2019s true. Among the kids only Arya has inherited his look, the Stark look, but these are mere physical similarities. Robb is stubborn and self-confident, as pungent and charismatic as Brandon was. Sansa and Arya painfully remind him of Lyanna, each in a different way. Bran is reckless and curious, as cheerful as Benjen. Rickon is still too young for him to express an opinion on his character.</p><p>\u201cDoes it irritate you?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond immediately. Her hand is tight around his tunic, near the heart. She raises her head to look into his eyes. \u201cDo you ever think what it would have been like if you had brought him here and raised him as your bastard? If you hadn\u2019t told me the truth?\u201d He also hears the questions she doesn\u2019t dare to pronounce. <i>Do you think we would be where we are now, like this? Would I be able to forgive you for betraying me? Would I have the strength to love you anyway?</i></p><p>He touches her forehead with his lips. \u201cEvery day,\u201d he admits.</p><p>iii</p><p>It isn\u2019t the first time that Robert disappoints him, but it is the first time he discovers he cannot forgive him. Sansa\u2019s shattering sobs, the anguished way she is embracing her direwolf would melt a heart of stone. Not that of the Queen, nor that of the King, apparently.</p><p>Ned passes an arm around Sansa\u2019s shoulders, trying to convince her to let go Lady, but Sansa is stubborn, just like Catelyn and hers is an iron grip. Arya has already run away, probably went to hole up in some corner to cry the tears she held back from the moment the Hound entered the tent with a bloody sword decreeing Mycah\u2019s death.</p><p>Ned knows what to do, even if the thought fills him with revulsion.</p><p>Then it happens.</p><p>Jon steps forward and kneels in front of Robert. No matter how awkward he may appear, he moves with lethal grace. Ned saw him sparring, saw the easy camaraderie he established with Robb during his stay in Winterfell (his son is impulsive and impetuous and proud, but he knows how to recognize his mistakes and after the first defeats, it was him who sought Jon\u2019s company, who asked him to train together), he knows that even the Kingslayer takes pleasure in their swordplay. Looking at the inflexible line of his back, Ned doesn\u2019t know what to think. He doesn\u2019t understand Jon, he doesn\u2019t know him. His nephew, with his silences and the constant frown that never leaves his forehead. His nephew who always wears black and brown leathers. Introverted, but not shy. Usually a boy of few words, a silent\u00a0observer.</p><p>\u201cYour grace,\u201d Jon says, his head dutifully bowed, \u201cif I\u2019m allowed to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, boy,\u201d replies Robert, but there is no real bite in his cursing, only blatant fondness. \u201cEvery time this spiel of\u00a0obsequious banter. If you want to talk, then talk. You don\u2019t have to ask my permission.\u201d</p><p>Jon gets up with a fluid movement and when he talks it\u2019s like hearing Lyanna, her incurable thirst for justice. \u201cLady Sansa\u2019s direwolf is innocent and so was the boy. This is not the King\u2019s justice. It is only revenge ruled by anger.\u201d</p><p>Robert runs his hand over his beard, listening intently. Standing at his side the Queen\u2019s eyes are reduced to two slits yet she remains silent, even if she stares at Jon with open hostility.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you propose, boy? My queen wants blood. She is a fierce lioness and one of her cubs was wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScars are what make a man a warrior. Scars like that\u2026\u201d Jon looks in the direction of Joffrey, of his bandaged arm. There is no scorn in his tone, but Ned holds his breath because the meaning behind the words is unmistakable. \u201cAny man would show them off with pride. However, he is the prince and he was injured. What happened, regardless of how it happened, is unforgivable. Since the Queen asks for the head of a direwolf, I propose an exchange. Spare that of Lady Sansa and take mine instead.\u201d</p><p>Silence and tension are as dense as the morning fog.</p><p>\u201cJon, no,\u201d a broken voice whines behind him and Ned catches Sansa\u2019s guilty and striken expression.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asks Robert. \u201cThere's\u00a0no coming back from\u00a0that.\u201d</p><p>Jon merely nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d says Robert. \u201cNed, see that the sentence is executed. Now go away and leave me alone, all of you. I\u2019ve had enough of you troublemakers.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Later, after it\u2019s over, Ned watches Jon cover the remains of Ghost with his cloak. The boy\u2019s expression is closed and indecipherable.</p><p>Ned puts a hand on his shoulder and is surprised when Jon allows it. He\u2019s probably too distracted by what happened and hasn\u2019t even noticed it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bury him in the north,\u201d he promises.</p><p>This seems to awaken Jon. He blinks. \u201cI wish for him to be buried with Lady Lyanna.\u201d</p><p>Ned must fight against the sudden lump in his throat before speaking. \u201cIt will be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen will not be satisfied,\u201d Jon says after a moment. \u201cYou have to send Lady away. Get her back to Winterfell. There she will be safe.\u201d</p><p>Ned had hoped that was the end, but he realizes that it was foolish of him to think so. Death calls for death, blood wants more blood. He\u2019s just surprised that Jon, so young, has already learned this lesson. Not for the first time, he wonders what Jon had to endure, the kind of childhood he had.</p><p>What happened in the King\u2019s tent, the exchange of words and looks he witnessed. He lets the hand fall to his side. What right does he have to comfort Lyanna\u2019s boy right now? </p><p>\u201cIn there,\u201d he says and Jon turns. \u201cYou knew what would happen.\u201d</p><p>It is clear that Jon knows what he is referring to by the way he avoids his gaze and is mulling over how to respond, weighing the words and deciding what to admit.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t my family, but I grew up with them,\u201d he says and it is a painful, bitter truth. A purulent and rodent wound just as much for him as it must be for Jon. Lyanna\u2019s eyes stare at him from his grave face, accusers and sad, as if they knew, as if he understood the extent of his guilt. <i>How did you protect him? How did you keep your oath? Throwing him to the lions</i>.</p><p>The moment passes. Jon shrugs, unperturbed. \u201cI know how they think, what they feel. Sometimes it seems like I know them more and better than I know myself.\u201d</p><p>Ned thinks back to the time when in the crypts, after Robert\u2019s proposal to join their families, Jon didn\u2019t immediately follow the King. He stared intently at Lyanna\u2019s sculpted face while Ned thought, <i>you won\u2019t know the sound of her laughter. You will never hear her sing to robins. You will not know of the pranks she used to play at\u00a0the expense of lords and servants, how her laughter was able to dissolve any resentment or animosity towards her afterwards, making her earn forgiveness and love from anyone who knew her.</i></p><p>Jon advised him to wait. An engagement is for life. He remembers what he told him as if not a single day had passed, so deeply it struck him. \u201cLet them know each other, let them fall in love. Let them live the fairy tale. Give her a choice. Make her choose to get married because that\u2019s what she wants and not what she thinks she wants.\u201d</p><p>He knows Joffrey\u2019s temperament, he knows how he is. It is as he said. He grew up with them. Those people are not his family, but he knows how they think, how they behave.</p><p>He averted a catastrophe. After what he saw, he will never consent to a marriage between Sansa and Joffrey Baratheon.</p><p>iv</p><p>\u201cThe boy can\u2019t become King,\u201d says Robert. He refused the milk of poppy. His face is swollen and red, veiled with sweat. He has a fever. The wound infected and must hurt like seven hells. Nevertheless he seems lucid and more than ever like the man he loved as a boy, not the dissolute and careless King he has known in recent months.</p><p>In light of the discovery about the real parentage of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, Ned says nothing.</p><p>Robert punches the mattress. \u201cJoffrey,\u201d he says his son\u2019s name as if it tasted disgusting, as if he wanted to spit it out. \u201cHe cannot be King. He isn\u2019t suitable. He doesn\u2019t have the makings for governing.\u201d He twitches the eyes and it seems that the pain is getting worse because he is panting\u00a0heavily. \u201cJon was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d What does Jon have to do with all this?</p><p>Robert opens his eyes instantly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good boy. Diligent. Quiet. Well-mannered. He looks more like you than his father.\u201d He bursts out laughing and as often happens is a laugh at the expense of the world, for a joke he doesn\u2019t intend to share, which only he seems capable of fully understanding. \u201cA year ago he tried to talk to me. He wanted to convince me to issue an edict to name Tommen as crown prince. Obviously I didn\u2019t listen to him. You should have seen him, Ned.\u201d The smile that curves his mouth, supplanting the grimace of pain, is a smile that Ned remembers well. It has the taste of youth, of spring, of tournaments and winter roses, of dances and banquets.</p><p>\u201cIt was like she was talking to me. Lyanna. He had exactly her look. Do you remember her look? When she stuck to something and wanted to convince you to think the same way at all costs. It made you feel like slime in the channels, like she was ready to hit you if you dared to contradict her.\u201d Robert\u2019s eyes are shiny and wistful. \u201cMay the gods forgive me. I loved the boy as a son, more than my own. For years I imagined that he was her boy\u2019s, the son that she would have given me if everything had gone as it should have been. I saw him grow up and it was like seeing you and her again, mixed up. He would be a good King, a great one. He doesn\u2019t have my blood and he has no right to the crown, but if I could I would recognize him as my heir right now.\u201d</p><p>But he has it, Ned thinks. He could be King and he would have more right than those you consider your children.</p><p>\u201cHe would hate it.\u201d Robert bursts out laughing again. He holds his chest with both hands as if it hurt, but he doesn\u2019t stop laughing. It only ends when he is out of breath. \u201cYes,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cHe would hate it like I did. Like he hates this place. I wronged him. I should have send him north years ago. I was fucking selfish, but I loved him. As much as I loved her. My Queen of Love and Beauty.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>After his offer to let her and the children survive, when Cersei asks the inevitable question, the answers could be multiple. Honor, which requires not to claim innocent victims. Mercy, because now he can imagine precisely how difficult life must have been as the wife and queen of Robert. In the end the truth prevails. \u201cFor Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowns. She is a beautiful woman and if Robert had been a better man, a man capable of letting go the past and above all the idealized image of a dead girl, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be forced to have this conversation now, to do what the duty towards his king and the realm impose on him. \u201cI\u2019ve never been kind to him. He has every reason to hate me. If he knew what you discovered-\u201d</p><p>And this is perhaps the most difficult part. To know that the boy he had sworn to protect grew up in this nest of vipers. Lonely because of the King\u2019s love. Far away from the affection of the family that would have welcomed him and loved him, not a perfect love, but as indestructible as the Wall, vast and deep as the depths of the sea.</p><p>\u201cHe already knows,\u201d he admits. \u201cHe always knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d she says scornfully, but the doubt is sprouting. He can see the cracks in her mask, in her demeanor. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hindered Jon Arryn\u2019s research and he was the one who covered you for years. He made sure that Robert\u2019s bastards left the city discreetly, paying to cover their escape. The only one left is a blacksmith and just because I beat him to it.\u201d</p><p>Now she seems distraught. \u201cWhy should he have?\u201d She isn\u2019t looking at him, as if the question was addressed more to herself than to him. As if she had forgotten his presence, the sword hanging over her head, so great and shocking is the surprise of what he told her.</p><p>Even if this is the case, he answers the same, feeling his heart break exactly like the first time he put the threads together, at Robert\u2019s deathbed, \u201cBecause you are the only mother he has known for all his life and through you he discovered a woman\u2019s love for her children, even if was never directed towards him.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The cell where they locked him up is dark and cold. He survived worse things. The only torture is not knowing what happened to Sansa and Arya. And Jon. </p><p><i>Gods, what have I done?</i></p><p>After what he told the Queen, there is no way he can have survived. At best he was thrown into a cell similar to his.</p><p>When the door opens, hours, days, months later, Ned has to shield his eyes. The light of the torch that one of the two men has in his hand is blinding. He cannot make out their faces, only the blurred contours of their figures.</p><p>The taller man gives the torch to the other and kneels beside him. \u201cUncle,\u201d he says and for the first time in years Ned feels like he might cry.</p><p>He tries to talk, but all he can produce is a strangled cry. His mouth is dry, his lips like leaves about to crumble.</p><p>He tries again and croaks, \u201cSansa? Arya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d Jon reassures him and hands him a wineskin. Ned drinks greedily as Jon continues to update him on recent events, \u201cArya disappeared the day you were imprisoned. She must have escaped. Sansa,\u201d Jon hesitates imperceptibly, avoiding his gaze, \u201cshe is fine.\u201d</p><p>Ned grabs him by the wrist. \u201cWhat are you not telling me?\u201d</p><p>For a moment it looks like Jon doesn\u2019t want to tell him. Whatever it is, he doesn\u2019t like it. No matter how terrible it is, he wants to know, he must. Jon seems to understand because he nods slowly. He turns to the second man and finally Ned recognizes him.</p><p>Lord Varys comes forward and begins to speak, revealing what Jon would have preferred to keep to himself, \u201cThis morning Lady Sansa implored the King to spare you and the King graciously consented for the sincere love that binds him to your daughter. He will pardon you and allow you to join the Night\u2019s Watch, as long as you admit your betrayal to the whole Court and that Joffrey is the true King. As a friend, I strongly advise you to accept the offer. Doing so would protect your daughter. She could even be queen one day.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what worries and disgusts him more, if the shame that Sansa pleaded for him, kneeling at the foot of the iron throne in an attempt to save him or that one day she could be married to the monster that is Joffrey Lannister.</p><p>His opinion on the matter must be evident because Lord Varys sighs, a sigh of regret, as if with it he wants to express that despite everything he tried and that if he failed the fault is not attributable to him.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t pardon you,\u201d Jon says unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He asks without thinking. Then remember who he\u2019s talking to.</p><p>The smile that Jon gives him is empty and doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.<i> Because I know him,</i> he is saying. <i>Because I grew up with him. Because I know things you don\u2019t know and you\u2019ll never know.</i></p><p>Ned takes his head in his hands. For the first time in his life he doesn\u2019t know what to do, what to say. All he can think of is that he will die. It\u2019s a matter of hours, maybe days. He feels no fear, only regret. The regret of leaving Sansa alone and helpless and practically ad a captive of the Lannister. The regret of not seeing Catelyn again and not seeing the boys grow up. The regret of not having a future, of not being able to savor the old age they had dreamed of, gray and old and surrounded by grandchildren. There is a regret, however, that he can remedy. A thorn deep in his heart and that he could finally eliminate.</p><p>\u201cYour mother-\u201d begins and maybe it\u2019s an impression, but Jon looks pale, his face white as bone. He\u2019s just a boy, he thinks suddenly. I shouldn\u2019t give him this burden. He isn\u2019t ready, not yet. After all, the secret will not die with him. Catelyn is the next keeper.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon interrupts him firmly, but not without a certain amount of kindness.</p><p>He knows? \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know I grew up thinking I was your son?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like Jon to answer a question with another question. However, the absurdity of what he has just said makes his mind white and bleakly empty.</p><p>He looks just like you, Ned recalls Catelyn\u2019s voice. More than your children.</p><p>He would like for it to be true. He would like not to have accepted Robert\u2019s proposal and would have liked to have torn him from his arms with force, to hell with the consequences. He would like Jon to have grown up in Winterfell, protected, loved, safe. He would like hundreds of things, but here, at the mouth of the seven hells, while death looks him in the face through the eyes of his sister, he cannot lie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your father,\u201d he says, every word scratching his throat.</p><p>Jon looks at his hands, his face in shadow. \u201cNow I know.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound surprised. \u201cI knew since I met you. Since I saw how you treat your children. I\u2019m trying to be honest because-\u201d he swallows, running out of words.</p><p>Ned has never seen him so nervous, agitated. Even when he lost his direwolf he didn\u2019t react this way. Jon is usually calm, prudent, cautious. Not right now. He appears young and worried, as if he isn\u2019t the master of his emotions and the newness destabilizes him, makes him uncertain about how to proceed.</p><p>Ned lets him regain control. He feels he owes him at least this. Ti decide how he want to face the truth about himself. The choice is his. He will respect it, whatever it is. Not for duty or honor, but because it is right.</p><p>\u201cGrowing up with this face, knowing that I looked more like you than my supposed father\u2026\u201d Jon takes a deep breath and meets his gaze with the expression of someone about to face a battle. \u201cThe King liked to talk about your years together in the Vale. Lord Arryn would have preferred him to do it more discreetly. I never understood why he didn\u2019t like me, until one day I did. I understood. He believed what everyone believed. That you were my real father and that to cover up your disgrace you had asked Robert to help you. A loophole. For years I believed you were my father, that you couldn\u2019t bear my sight to the point of praying the King to take me as ward. I thought of you, in your castle of stone and snow, picturing how it would be like to have brothers and sisters, if you loved me at least a little or if I was just that to you, the perpetual memory of a moment of weakness, of your shame.\u201d</p><p><i>My dear boy. What have I done?</i></p><p>\u201cRobert legitimized you,\u201d he says.</p><p>Jon nods, but it\u2019s a gesture with no real meaning. \u201cA bastard remains a bastard even with a different name. I\u2019ve never been a Stark, not really, otherwise why would I have been forced to grow up here? Even if it wasn\u2019t an exile, it seemed like that to me.\u201d</p><p>When he is silent, obsessively staring at the wall, Ned observes his shining eyes and feels overcome by impotence, by a raw despair, a roaring wrath.</p><p>\u201cDuring the tournament in your honor I met Edric Dayne,\u201d Jon continues to talk. \u201cHe is Lord Dondarrion\u2019s squire. He seemed surprised by my questions about Lady Ashara. He couldn\u2019t understand the reasons. He was convinced that my mother\u2019s name was Wylla. She was his wet nurse. He told me we were milk brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was also yours for a short time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think anymore.\u201d Jon runs his hand through his hair. Ned can imagine what he must have felt, the frustration of not knowing and the need to discover the truth, vital and necessary. \u201cBy then I was sure you weren\u2019t my father. I knew you. I had seen the kind of man you were. Isn\u2019t it ironic?\u201d Jon laughs. It sounds depressing, bitterly disappointed. \u201cWhen I wanted you to be my father, I realized that it wasn\u2019t possible. I wasn\u2019t yours, so I really had to be Brandon\u2019s son. My mother\u2019s mystery remained. Who was she? I wrote to Lady Allyria Dayne. She confirmed my suspicions. Her sister had given birth during the Rebellion, it was true, but a stillborn, a girl. Wylla had been my nurse, she loved me like a mother, but she didn\u2019t give birth to me. I wasn\u2019t who I thought I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have written her,\u201d he reproaches him more forcefully than strictly necessary. \u201cIt was a risky and dangerous move. What would have happened if someone had intercepted the missive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the means,\u201d Jon responds, minimizing, but his eyes unknowingly move to the left, where Lord Varys is. </p><p><i>Since when? When did you start weaving plots and collaborating with the Spider?</i></p><p>He isn\u2019t surprised, not really. Jon\u2019s fate was marked from the moment he was forced to grow up at court under the King\u2019s protection. And what protection was it? It isn\u2019t a shield, something that has protected him from the whispers, from the looks. A name doesn\u2019t make you less alone when the only boys you grow up with are cruel and derisive and the others too small to understand what is happening, to act. When the adults around you consider you a burden, a stain, something to eradicate. When the only adult who shows you affection is too distracted by the past to pay attention to the present. What can you do if not train yourself to the bone and become a skilled swordsman with Lord Barristan to fill endless afternoons that you wouldn\u2019t know how to spend otherwise? To study and beating yourself up you to show that you are worthy of respect, for them to leave you alone?</p><p>\u201cI have the Stark traits, I was given the name Stark, but I\u2019m not your son, I\u2019m not Brandon\u2019s son. There is another brother, but he is in the Night\u2019s Watch. Fifteen years ago, you came back from Dorne with a child, along with a wet nurse named Wylla and the bones of your sister, after you\u00a0smashed a tower to pieces. Say it,\u201d he orders with a look that could cut. \u201cMy mother\u2019s name. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTargaryen,\u201d he corrects him. \u201cLady Dayne wrote something else. Apparently I was never a bastard.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too much information. After days of silence and darkness, it\u2019s happening too much and too fast. He can\u2019t reason. He massages his temple. \u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo give you the opportunity to redeem yourself and do something right. They will kill you. Joffrey may have agreed to pardon you this afternoon, but if it is not today, it will be tomorrow or another day. He will change his mind and go back on his word because that\u2019s what he does, what he likes. You know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, he knows. He learned it the hard way. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the truth. Say what you discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is honor also in the way we die. It will allow us to buy time.\u201d</p><p>(I reached the word limit so I leave the link where to find it complete.)</p><p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F19070323&amp;t=NzAzYjhjYmU4NzI5OWVmODJlMjk2NjgyNzNjODA0NTM2OTU0NmJlNiwyNjk0NjE0M2VlNzNiMmZlOTE0MzA1Y2FiODYwYTkzMTY0MDliZmEy\",\"display_url\":\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19070323\",\"title\":\"\\n        The flight of youth - Ruta - A Song of Ice and Fire - George R.

He has no name, not yet.</p><p><i>Raise him like he\u2019s yours. Protect him.</i> These were Lyanna\u2019s last words. It\u2019s what he promised and he will do.</p><p>Thoughts assail him in moments of forced quiet, in slumber, gnawing at his soul like rats.</p><p>During the night, when everything is dark and there is no glimmer of light, the burden of the secret and the consequences of his promise weigh heavily on his mind.</p><p>What will people think when they see him return after the war with a bastard in his arms? What will Catelyn think?</p><p>The thought of his wife, of the fragile hopes he had placed in their marriage, the feeling that they had reached an understanding, the certainty of being able to build something together little by little. If not love, at least a relationship of friendship, respect, trust, devotion.</p><p>He keenly feels the loss of what could have been and never will be.</p><p>*</p><p>His precautions don\u2019t matter. In the end Robert tracks him.</p><p>(Two days ago he arrived at King\u2019s Landing to find the Mad King in a pool of his own blood, to discover the cruel brutality of Elia Martell and her sons deaths.)</p><p>He is not ready, he never will be. Lying is difficult for him. Lying to the boy with whom he grew up and that is like a brother to him seems impossible. It\u2019s dishonorable and wrong, but he knows Robert and knows that Lyanna\u2019s fear was legitimate. If Robert had the slightest doubt, if he suspected something, it would be the end. It would mean fury and ruin. Too much blood has already been spilled.</p><p>Now or never, he thinks.</p><p>Robert observes the child in his arms and for the first time in the last year it seems that the storm raging at the bottom of his clear eyes subsides. The frenzy that not even Raeghar\u2019s death managed to extinguish disappears, buried behind the shadow of a smile that peeks out from his long and bristly beard.</p><p>Ned lets Robert take the child and already feels the absence of his familiar weight against the chest, similar to an amputation.</p><p>He watches as he cradle him, a small and screaming bundle pressed against a mighty chest. Robert still wears his armor and is covered in mud and encrusted blood. Jon doesn\u2019t seem to care. He stops crying and in the sudden silence the ringing in his ears becomes the only noise inside the tent. He feels suffocated. The scorching sun of Dorne is far away and so are the desert lands that he has crossed like a man damned by the gods. If he closes his eyes, however, he can still feel the stifling heat of the room in which he found Lyanna, the stench of death.</p><p>\u201cCat will never accept him,\u201d says Robert. He\u2019s tickling Jon\u2019s chin. \u201cThis will destroy your marriage.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the truth and perhaps it was the awareness of this that stole his sleep and peace. Not the memory of the dead, but the torment of the living, knowing the battle that awaits him within the walls of his house.</p><p>\u201cGive him to me, Ned. Give me your boy and I\u2019ll raise him as if he were mine. He will be my ward. The war took Lyanna from me. I won the war for a wolf.\u201d</p><p>He wakes up from a nightmare to find himself catapulted into another.</p><p>Now he recognizes the exalted and euphoric expression on Robert\u2019s face and hates himself for not immediately noticing. It is the same expression with which he looked at Lyanna, all possessive and fierce tenderness. Lyanna who hated conventions, the restrictions of being a woman. Lyanna who was free and wild and indomitable, but had a kind heart and always dreamed of great adventures, great loves, to live the stories of her favorite books, to become like the heroes of her songs. Lyanna who loved to dance and ride. Lyanna who died, entrusting him with her most precious thing. He is pervaded by an absolute, blinding rage. It is the injustice of everything that has happened to his family. One misfortune after another. And after all that grief, now <i>this</i>.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a trophy, Robert,\u201d he says and his voice sounds bitter and terrifying. \u201cIt\u2019s the life of a child you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019ve sworn to protect him, to keep him safe. On his mother\u2019s deathbed, I-\u201d he stops abruptly for the horror of what he has just let slip in the heat of the moment. The emotions that have taken over, obscuring the reason. He knows he must have gone pale.</p><p>Robert doesn\u2019t flinch. He must have noticed his tension as he must have noticed the suspicious way he stopped talking suddenly.</p><p><i>Gods, let him not understand. Gods, you aren\u2019t always just and forgiving. You haven\u2019t been with Lyanna. Be with her son.</i></p><p>\u201cTell me the truth.\u201d Robert\u2019s gaze is open and inquisitive, it seems to pierce him apart. \u201cHe isn\u2019t yours, is it?\u201d Then, like a bolt from the blue, in a thoughtful and unusually serious tone, he asks, \u201cIs he Brandon\u2019s bastard?\u201d</p><p>His surprise twines indissolubly with relief. He thanks all the existing gods, old and new and those who are strangers to him and who have altars of fire, gold and horse bones beyond the Narrow Sea.</p><p>Obviously Robert misunderstands. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. Did you think I didn\u2019t know? People like to talk. So Lady Dayne really committed suicide because of a broken heart.\u201d He shakes his head and his sadness is genuine. Probably the idea of \u200b\u200bthat tragic love reminds him of his own. \u201cPoor girl.\u201d</p><p>A gurgling verse elicits yet another smile. It is amazing to watch the change, the chasing of lights and shadows on the corners of his angular face. The fierce warrior tamed by a child. Robert touches the delicate and frail curve of Jon\u2019s skull. Ned thinks of Aegon Targaryen, of little Rhaenys, of the bloody end of Elia Martell. Of a mad king murdered by one of the knights who had sworn to serve him. Betrayals and oaths, achievements and secrets.</p><p>\u201cI can legitimize him,\u201d insists Robert. \u201cI can give him a title, recognize him as his father\u2019s son. You don\u2019t need to take responsibility for him, atone for a sin not yours.\u201d</p><p>On the contrary, the sin is also his. He didn\u2019t arrive in time. He failed to save Lyanna. He sighs and that simple gesture seems to deprive him of any residual energy. He feels incredibly tired and old. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d He asks. \u201cYou said that Jon would destroy my marriage. What about yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d echoes Robert\u2019s voice, starstruck. \u201cYou fucking bastard. I\u2019ve always wanted to call one of my boys like that.\u201d</p><p><i>Me too</i>. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? I will never love any woman as I loved Lyanna, but my wife will be queen. This will have to be enough and she will have to accept Jon Stark, whether she likes it or not.\u201d</p><p>He knows it\u2019s a gamble. He should prevent it from happening. Make excuses.</p><p>Robert continues to smile at the son of the man he hates. The man he killed for revenge and to pay off a debt of pride.</p><p>He is trapped.</p><p><i>Lyanna, forgive me.</i></p><p>*</p><p>The news travels fast, carried by raven\u2019s wings propelled by strong winds.</p><p>The new King has a ward. An orphan and a bastard whom he has already legitimized.</p><p>When he returns home, Ned is a changed man, hopelessly different from the man he was before he left for the war. Why shouldn\u2019t he? The war took away everything from him. His father, his brother, his sister. His honor.</p><p>He returns to discover that Benjen intends to take the black and that his mother has slowly gone out, the most romantic say for the heartbreak of having survived the death of her family. But he knew her, strengths and weaknesses. It wasn\u2019t despair and mourning that killed her, but anger, bitterness, a burning hatred. His mother was a strong and passionate woman, but even the hardest stone can break under the right pressure.</p><p>He comes back to discover that his wife, whose colors he knows, but not the most intimate thoughts, meanwhile gave birth to a male child. A healthy and robust child. She called him Robb and he thinks he loves her a little for that.</p><p>In the chambers that belonged to his father and mother and which now belong to him and Catelyn, Ned holds his first child. Blood of his blood. Partly Stark partly Tully.</p><p>Motherhood has made Catelyn radiant. It made her flourish again. She must miss terribly the great rivers and the expanses of grass covered with dew, the exterminated fields, the wild flowers. A part of her must hate this hard and cold land where nothing pretty grows, where everything is white or dark, covered with moss.</p><p>She\u2019s trying to adapt. She wants to learn to be happy here with him. She set aside the elaborate braids and garments with gaudy tones. Now she is the portrait of sobriety and composure. Only her hair shines like red gold against the fire in the fireplace and so does Robb\u2019s.</p><p>She didn\u2019t welcome him with a hug, but when they were alone and he sought the reassuring warmth of her body, she let him attract her against him and reciprocated his embrace with equal force.</p><p>I\u2019m home, he thought. This is my home now.</p><p>While nursing Robb, Catelyn is careful to ask general questions about the South, about Robert. Neither of them speak of the deads, the spoils of war. Nevertheless the argument cannot be avoided. When he mentions Jon Stark, he sees the pain in his wife\u2019s sky blue eyes and can\u2019t stand it. In his case it would have been humiliation and wounded pride. In Brandon\u2019s case it is something profoundly different. No matter how, Catelyn loved him. Discovering that she has been betrayed remains a severe blow, a sour bite to swallow. She reacts stoically, but her features are expressionless, her eyes cold and dry, her shoulders stiff, the crease of her thin mouth is decidedly unhappy.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to build the foundation of their marriage on a lie.</p><p>In another situation he would have acted differently. Not in this one. In this Jon has already been lost and he failed to protect him as he should have.</p><p>He kneels in front of his wife and taking her hand, in a broken whisper, briefly tells her about a bed soaked with blood and the last words of a beloved sister lost in the worst way, the forbidden love of a wolf and a dragon, of a child guilty only of being born on the side of the losers at the end of a war that made him an orphan.</p><p>In the end, Ned isn\u2019t the only one crying.</p><p>Robb has fallen asleep and his small face is placid and blissful.</p><p>Catelyn looks devastated. \u201cOh, Ned,\u201d she whispers softly. She puts her hand against his cheek and he turns his head to kiss her palm. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he hears her say. \u201cTell me what I can do. How can I help you.\u201d</p><p>There are traces of dry tears on her pale cheeks and new tears are accumulated against her dark eyelashes. She has never seemed more beautiful to him. He has never been so close to feeling something like this. Not a violent passion, but an affection of a piercing, disruptive sweetness that seems to fill the cracks inside him.</p><p>\u201cBear the burden with me,\u201d he answers. \u201cKeep the secret and swear by my gods and yours to never reveal it to anyone.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, sad and resolute. She smooths with a finger the worry lines between his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s a Stark secret and I\u2019m a Stark now. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>ii</p><p>The King\u2019s arrival is welcomed by the procession of the inhabitants of Winterfell gathered in the inner courtyard. It is a triumph of opulence that clashes all the more openly with the austerity of the castle. The Starks are in the front row.</p><p>Ned kneels before Robert and pronounces the usual words, hiding a smile little and badly.</p><p>Robert\u2019s eyes betray the same mirth. When he tells him to get up and crush him in a bear hug, he finds in the fat and rowdy man who stands in front of him his oldest and dearest friend.</p><p>The necessary introductions are made. Only a few moments seem to have elapsed when Robert slips his hand below the belt and declares that he wants to go down into the crypts.</p><p>Ned has no choice but to obey.</p><p>He leads the way, after exchanging a look of understanding with Catelyn. Her eyes leave his to stare at a point behind him and he sees a flash of surprise crossing over her face.</p><p>He takes a moment too long to understand and it happens when Robert says, the surliness swept away by a hint of rude kindness, \u201cCome with us, boy. I want you to see her. It\u2019s your aunt after all.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the first time he sees his nephew after fourteen years and gods, the resemblance is impressive.</p><p>The shape of the mouth is that of Brandon, only that while his brother\u2019s was prone to grins, Jon\u2019s seems perpetually sullen, so as the thick and frowned eyebrows are those of his mother.</p><p>The penetrating gray cloud eyes are entirely Lyanna and the way he moves, with determination yet light, reminds him of other ghosts. He is a Stark in every way. There is nothing of his father in him and he knows he must be grateful.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d he says and doesn\u2019t know whether to hug him. He is at an age when such gestures are perceived with aversion. It\u2019s the same with Robb.</p><p>Jon must read his indecision because he smiles with his eyes, squeezing them slightly as Benjen does when he tries to hold back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cUncle,\u201d he greets him with a nod and without another word follows Robert.</p><p>*</p><p>That night, embracing Catelyn in their bed, they comment on their respective days as usual. It\u2019s an old habit.</p><p>\u201cRodrick said that during the training Jon disarmed Robb three times.\u201d She has her head resting on his shoulder and he caresses her long loose hair, passing it between his fingers like silk ribbons.</p><p>Ned chuckles. \u201cI can imagine Robb\u2019s reaction.\u201d</p><p>Catelyn lightly hits him on the arm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to laugh about. You know how he becomes when he loses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re kids.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThey are growing. Let them\u00a0sort things out for themselves.\u201d</p><p>The silence that follows is comfortable and relaxing. \u201cHe resembles her,\u201d he mutters in thought. He doesn\u2019t need to specify who he is referring to.</p><p>Catelyn is strangely silent. \u201cHe looks just like you,\u201d she finally says with her eyebrows furrowed. \u201cHe looks more like you than your children.\u201d</p><p>The idea seems to disturb her. It\u2019s true. Among the kids only Arya has inherited his look, the Stark look, but these are mere physical similarities. Robb is stubborn and self-confident, as pungent and charismatic as Brandon was. Sansa and Arya painfully remind him of Lyanna, each in a different way. Bran is reckless and curious, as cheerful as Benjen. Rickon is still too young for him to express an opinion on his character.</p><p>\u201cDoes it irritate you?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond immediately. Her hand is tight around his tunic, near the heart. She raises her head to look into his eyes. \u201cDo you ever think what it would have been like if you had brought him here and raised him as your bastard? If you hadn\u2019t told me the truth?\u201d He also hears the questions she doesn\u2019t dare to pronounce. <i>Do you think we would be where we are now, like this? Would I be able to forgive you for betraying me? Would I have the strength to love you anyway?</i></p><p>He touches her forehead with his lips. \u201cEvery day,\u201d he admits.</p><p>iii</p><p>It isn\u2019t the first time that Robert disappoints him, but it is the first time he discovers he cannot forgive him. Sansa\u2019s shattering sobs, the anguished way she is embracing her direwolf would melt a heart of stone. Not that of the Queen, nor that of the King, apparently.</p><p>Ned passes an arm around Sansa\u2019s shoulders, trying to convince her to let go Lady, but Sansa is stubborn, just like Catelyn and hers is an iron grip. Arya has already run away, probably went to hole up in some corner to cry the tears she held back from the moment the Hound entered the tent with a bloody sword decreeing Mycah\u2019s death.</p><p>Ned knows what to do, even if the thought fills him with revulsion.</p><p>Then it happens.</p><p>Jon steps forward and kneels in front of Robert. No matter how awkward he may appear, he moves with lethal grace. Ned saw him sparring, saw the easy camaraderie he established with Robb during his stay in Winterfell (his son is impulsive and impetuous and proud, but he knows how to recognize his mistakes and after the first defeats, it was him who sought Jon\u2019s company, who asked him to train together), he knows that even the Kingslayer takes pleasure in their swordplay. Looking at the inflexible line of his back, Ned doesn\u2019t know what to think. He doesn\u2019t understand Jon, he doesn\u2019t know him. His nephew, with his silences and the constant frown that never leaves his forehead. His nephew who always wears black and brown leathers. Introverted, but not shy. Usually a boy of few words, a silent\u00a0observer.</p><p>\u201cYour grace,\u201d Jon says, his head dutifully bowed, \u201cif I\u2019m allowed to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, boy,\u201d replies Robert, but there is no real bite in his cursing, only blatant fondness. \u201cEvery time this spiel of\u00a0obsequious banter. If you want to talk, then talk. You don\u2019t have to ask my permission.\u201d</p><p>Jon gets up with a fluid movement and when he talks it\u2019s like hearing Lyanna, her incurable thirst for justice. \u201cLady Sansa\u2019s direwolf is innocent and so was the boy. This is not the King\u2019s justice. It is only revenge ruled by anger.\u201d</p><p>Robert runs his hand over his beard, listening intently. Standing at his side the Queen\u2019s eyes are reduced to two slits yet she remains silent, even if she stares at Jon with open hostility.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you propose, boy? My queen wants blood. She is a fierce lioness and one of her cubs was wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScars are what make a man a warrior. Scars like that\u2026\u201d Jon looks in the direction of Joffrey, of his bandaged arm. There is no scorn in his tone, but Ned holds his breath because the meaning behind the words is unmistakable. \u201cAny man would show them off with pride. However, he is the prince and he was injured. What happened, regardless of how it happened, is unforgivable. Since the Queen asks for the head of a direwolf, I propose an exchange. Spare that of Lady Sansa and take mine instead.\u201d</p><p>Silence and tension are as dense as the morning fog.</p><p>\u201cJon, no,\u201d a broken voice whines behind him and Ned catches Sansa\u2019s guilty and striken expression.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asks Robert. \u201cThere's\u00a0no coming back from\u00a0that.\u201d</p><p>Jon merely nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d says Robert. \u201cNed, see that the sentence is executed. Now go away and leave me alone, all of you. I\u2019ve had enough of you troublemakers.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Later, after it\u2019s over, Ned watches Jon cover the remains of Ghost with his cloak. The boy\u2019s expression is closed and indecipherable.</p><p>Ned puts a hand on his shoulder and is surprised when Jon allows it. He\u2019s probably too distracted by what happened and hasn\u2019t even noticed it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bury him in the north,\u201d he promises.</p><p>This seems to awaken Jon. He blinks. \u201cI wish for him to be buried with Lady Lyanna.\u201d</p><p>Ned must fight against the sudden lump in his throat before speaking. \u201cIt will be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen will not be satisfied,\u201d Jon says after a moment. \u201cYou have to send Lady away. Get her back to Winterfell. There she will be safe.\u201d</p><p>Ned had hoped that was the end, but he realizes that it was foolish of him to think so. Death calls for death, blood wants more blood. He\u2019s just surprised that Jon, so young, has already learned this lesson. Not for the first time, he wonders what Jon had to endure, the kind of childhood he had.</p><p>What happened in the King\u2019s tent, the exchange of words and looks he witnessed. He lets the hand fall to his side. What right does he have to comfort Lyanna\u2019s boy right now? </p><p>\u201cIn there,\u201d he says and Jon turns. \u201cYou knew what would happen.\u201d</p><p>It is clear that Jon knows what he is referring to by the way he avoids his gaze and is mulling over how to respond, weighing the words and deciding what to admit.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t my family, but I grew up with them,\u201d he says and it is a painful, bitter truth. A purulent and rodent wound just as much for him as it must be for Jon. Lyanna\u2019s eyes stare at him from his grave face, accusers and sad, as if they knew, as if he understood the extent of his guilt. <i>How did you protect him? How did you keep your oath? Throwing him to the lions</i>.</p><p>The moment passes. Jon shrugs, unperturbed. \u201cI know how they think, what they feel. Sometimes it seems like I know them more and better than I know myself.\u201d</p><p>Ned thinks back to the time when in the crypts, after Robert\u2019s proposal to join their families, Jon didn\u2019t immediately follow the King. He stared intently at Lyanna\u2019s sculpted face while Ned thought, <i>you won\u2019t know the sound of her laughter. You will never hear her sing to robins. You will not know of the pranks she used to play at\u00a0the expense of lords and servants, how her laughter was able to dissolve any resentment or animosity towards her afterwards, making her earn forgiveness and love from anyone who knew her.</i></p><p>Jon advised him to wait. An engagement is for life. He remembers what he told him as if not a single day had passed, so deeply it struck him. \u201cLet them know each other, let them fall in love. Let them live the fairy tale. Give her a choice. Make her choose to get married because that\u2019s what she wants and not what she thinks she wants.\u201d</p><p>He knows Joffrey\u2019s temperament, he knows how he is. It is as he said. He grew up with them. Those people are not his family, but he knows how they think, how they behave.</p><p>He averted a catastrophe. After what he saw, he will never consent to a marriage between Sansa and Joffrey Baratheon.</p><p>iv</p><p>\u201cThe boy can\u2019t become King,\u201d says Robert. He refused the milk of poppy. His face is swollen and red, veiled with sweat. He has a fever. The wound infected and must hurt like seven hells. Nevertheless he seems lucid and more than ever like the man he loved as a boy, not the dissolute and careless King he has known in recent months.</p><p>In light of the discovery about the real parentage of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, Ned says nothing.</p><p>Robert punches the mattress. \u201cJoffrey,\u201d he says his son\u2019s name as if it tasted disgusting, as if he wanted to spit it out. \u201cHe cannot be King. He isn\u2019t suitable. He doesn\u2019t have the makings for governing.\u201d He twitches the eyes and it seems that the pain is getting worse because he is panting\u00a0heavily. \u201cJon was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d What does Jon have to do with all this?</p><p>Robert opens his eyes instantly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good boy. Diligent. Quiet. Well-mannered. He looks more like you than his father.\u201d He bursts out laughing and as often happens is a laugh at the expense of the world, for a joke he doesn\u2019t intend to share, which only he seems capable of fully understanding. \u201cA year ago he tried to talk to me. He wanted to convince me to issue an edict to name Tommen as crown prince. Obviously I didn\u2019t listen to him. You should have seen him, Ned.\u201d The smile that curves his mouth, supplanting the grimace of pain, is a smile that Ned remembers well. It has the taste of youth, of spring, of tournaments and winter roses, of dances and banquets.</p><p>\u201cIt was like she was talking to me. Lyanna. He had exactly her look. Do you remember her look? When she stuck to something and wanted to convince you to think the same way at all costs. It made you feel like slime in the channels, like she was ready to hit you if you dared to contradict her.\u201d Robert\u2019s eyes are shiny and wistful. \u201cMay the gods forgive me. I loved the boy as a son, more than my own. For years I imagined that he was her boy\u2019s, the son that she would have given me if everything had gone as it should have been. I saw him grow up and it was like seeing you and her again, mixed up. He would be a good King, a great one. He doesn\u2019t have my blood and he has no right to the crown, but if I could I would recognize him as my heir right now.\u201d</p><p>But he has it, Ned thinks. He could be King and he would have more right than those you consider your children.</p><p>\u201cHe would hate it.\u201d Robert bursts out laughing again. He holds his chest with both hands as if it hurt, but he doesn\u2019t stop laughing. It only ends when he is out of breath. \u201cYes,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cHe would hate it like I did. Like he hates this place. I wronged him. I should have send him north years ago. I was fucking selfish, but I loved him. As much as I loved her. My Queen of Love and Beauty.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>After his offer to let her and the children survive, when Cersei asks the inevitable question, the answers could be multiple. Honor, which requires not to claim innocent victims. Mercy, because now he can imagine precisely how difficult life must have been as the wife and queen of Robert. In the end the truth prevails. \u201cFor Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowns. She is a beautiful woman and if Robert had been a better man, a man capable of letting go the past and above all the idealized image of a dead girl, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be forced to have this conversation now, to do what the duty towards his king and the realm impose on him. \u201cI\u2019ve never been kind to him. He has every reason to hate me. If he knew what you discovered-\u201d</p><p>And this is perhaps the most difficult part. To know that the boy he had sworn to protect grew up in this nest of vipers. Lonely because of the King\u2019s love. Far away from the affection of the family that would have welcomed him and loved him, not a perfect love, but as indestructible as the Wall, vast and deep as the depths of the sea.</p><p>\u201cHe already knows,\u201d he admits. \u201cHe always knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d she says scornfully, but the doubt is sprouting. He can see the cracks in her mask, in her demeanor. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hindered Jon Arryn\u2019s research and he was the one who covered you for years. He made sure that Robert\u2019s bastards left the city discreetly, paying to cover their escape. The only one left is a blacksmith and just because I beat him to it.\u201d</p><p>Now she seems distraught. \u201cWhy should he have?\u201d She isn\u2019t looking at him, as if the question was addressed more to herself than to him. As if she had forgotten his presence, the sword hanging over her head, so great and shocking is the surprise of what he told her.</p><p>Even if this is the case, he answers the same, feeling his heart break exactly like the first time he put the threads together, at Robert\u2019s deathbed, \u201cBecause you are the only mother he has known for all his life and through you he discovered a woman\u2019s love for her children, even if was never directed towards him.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>The cell where they locked him up is dark and cold. He survived worse things. The only torture is not knowing what happened to Sansa and Arya. And Jon. </p><p><i>Gods, what have I done?</i></p><p>After what he told the Queen, there is no way he can have survived. At best he was thrown into a cell similar to his.</p><p>When the door opens, hours, days, months later, Ned has to shield his eyes. The light of the torch that one of the two men has in his hand is blinding. He cannot make out their faces, only the blurred contours of their figures.</p><p>The taller man gives the torch to the other and kneels beside him. \u201cUncle,\u201d he says and for the first time in years Ned feels like he might cry.</p><p>He tries to talk, but all he can produce is a strangled cry. His mouth is dry, his lips like leaves about to crumble.</p><p>He tries again and croaks, \u201cSansa? Arya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d Jon reassures him and hands him a wineskin. Ned drinks greedily as Jon continues to update him on recent events, \u201cArya disappeared the day you were imprisoned. She must have escaped. Sansa,\u201d Jon hesitates imperceptibly, avoiding his gaze, \u201cshe is fine.\u201d</p><p>Ned grabs him by the wrist. \u201cWhat are you not telling me?\u201d</p><p>For a moment it looks like Jon doesn\u2019t want to tell him. Whatever it is, he doesn\u2019t like it. No matter how terrible it is, he wants to know, he must. Jon seems to understand because he nods slowly. He turns to the second man and finally Ned recognizes him.</p><p>Lord Varys comes forward and begins to speak, revealing what Jon would have preferred to keep to himself, \u201cThis morning Lady Sansa implored the King to spare you and the King graciously consented for the sincere love that binds him to your daughter. He will pardon you and allow you to join the Night\u2019s Watch, as long as you admit your betrayal to the whole Court and that Joffrey is the true King. As a friend, I strongly advise you to accept the offer. Doing so would protect your daughter. She could even be queen one day.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what worries and disgusts him more, if the shame that Sansa pleaded for him, kneeling at the foot of the iron throne in an attempt to save him or that one day she could be married to the monster that is Joffrey Lannister.</p><p>His opinion on the matter must be evident because Lord Varys sighs, a sigh of regret, as if with it he wants to express that despite everything he tried and that if he failed the fault is not attributable to him.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t pardon you,\u201d Jon says unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He asks without thinking. Then remember who he\u2019s talking to.</p><p>The smile that Jon gives him is empty and doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.<i> Because I know him,</i> he is saying. <i>Because I grew up with him. Because I know things you don\u2019t know and you\u2019ll never know.</i></p><p>Ned takes his head in his hands. For the first time in his life he doesn\u2019t know what to do, what to say. All he can think of is that he will die. It\u2019s a matter of hours, maybe days. He feels no fear, only regret. The regret of leaving Sansa alone and helpless and practically ad a captive of the Lannister. The regret of not seeing Catelyn again and not seeing the boys grow up. The regret of not having a future, of not being able to savor the old age they had dreamed of, gray and old and surrounded by grandchildren. There is a regret, however, that he can remedy. A thorn deep in his heart and that he could finally eliminate.</p><p>\u201cYour mother-\u201d begins and maybe it\u2019s an impression, but Jon looks pale, his face white as bone. He\u2019s just a boy, he thinks suddenly. I shouldn\u2019t give him this burden. He isn\u2019t ready, not yet. After all, the secret will not die with him. Catelyn is the next keeper.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon interrupts him firmly, but not without a certain amount of kindness.</p><p>He knows? \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know I grew up thinking I was your son?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like Jon to answer a question with another question. However, the absurdity of what he has just said makes his mind white and bleakly empty.</p><p>He looks just like you, Ned recalls Catelyn\u2019s voice. More than your children.</p><p>He would like for it to be true. He would like not to have accepted Robert\u2019s proposal and would have liked to have torn him from his arms with force, to hell with the consequences. He would like Jon to have grown up in Winterfell, protected, loved, safe. He would like hundreds of things, but here, at the mouth of the seven hells, while death looks him in the face through the eyes of his sister, he cannot lie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your father,\u201d he says, every word scratching his throat.</p><p>Jon looks at his hands, his face in shadow. \u201cNow I know.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound surprised. \u201cI knew since I met you. Since I saw how you treat your children. I\u2019m trying to be honest because-\u201d he swallows, running out of words.</p><p>Ned has never seen him so nervous, agitated. Even when he lost his direwolf he didn\u2019t react this way. Jon is usually calm, prudent, cautious. Not right now. He appears young and worried, as if he isn\u2019t the master of his emotions and the newness destabilizes him, makes him uncertain about how to proceed.</p><p>Ned lets him regain control. He feels he owes him at least this. Ti decide how he want to face the truth about himself. The choice is his. He will respect it, whatever it is. Not for duty or honor, but because it is right.</p><p>\u201cGrowing up with this face, knowing that I looked more like you than my supposed father\u2026\u201d Jon takes a deep breath and meets his gaze with the expression of someone about to face a battle. \u201cThe King liked to talk about your years together in the Vale. Lord Arryn would have preferred him to do it more discreetly. I never understood why he didn\u2019t like me, until one day I did. I understood. He believed what everyone believed. That you were my real father and that to cover up your disgrace you had asked Robert to help you. A loophole. For years I believed you were my father, that you couldn\u2019t bear my sight to the point of praying the King to take me as ward. I thought of you, in your castle of stone and snow, picturing how it would be like to have brothers and sisters, if you loved me at least a little or if I was just that to you, the perpetual memory of a moment of weakness, of your shame.\u201d</p><p><i>My dear boy. What have I done?</i></p><p>\u201cRobert legitimized you,\u201d he says.</p><p>Jon nods, but it\u2019s a gesture with no real meaning. \u201cA bastard remains a bastard even with a different name. I\u2019ve never been a Stark, not really, otherwise why would I have been forced to grow up here? Even if it wasn\u2019t an exile, it seemed like that to me.\u201d</p><p>When he is silent, obsessively staring at the wall, Ned observes his shining eyes and feels overcome by impotence, by a raw despair, a roaring wrath.</p><p>\u201cDuring the tournament in your honor I met Edric Dayne,\u201d Jon continues to talk. \u201cHe is Lord Dondarrion\u2019s squire. He seemed surprised by my questions about Lady Ashara. He couldn\u2019t understand the reasons. He was convinced that my mother\u2019s name was Wylla. She was his wet nurse. He told me we were milk brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was also yours for a short time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think anymore.\u201d Jon runs his hand through his hair. Ned can imagine what he must have felt, the frustration of not knowing and the need to discover the truth, vital and necessary. \u201cBy then I was sure you weren\u2019t my father. I knew you. I had seen the kind of man you were. Isn\u2019t it ironic?\u201d Jon laughs. It sounds depressing, bitterly disappointed. \u201cWhen I wanted you to be my father, I realized that it wasn\u2019t possible. I wasn\u2019t yours, so I really had to be Brandon\u2019s son. My mother\u2019s mystery remained. Who was she? I wrote to Lady Allyria Dayne. She confirmed my suspicions. Her sister had given birth during the Rebellion, it was true, but a stillborn, a girl. Wylla had been my nurse, she loved me like a mother, but she didn\u2019t give birth to me. I wasn\u2019t who I thought I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have written her,\u201d he reproaches him more forcefully than strictly necessary. \u201cIt was a risky and dangerous move. What would have happened if someone had intercepted the missive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the means,\u201d Jon responds, minimizing, but his eyes unknowingly move to the left, where Lord Varys is. </p><p><i>Since when? When did you start weaving plots and collaborating with the Spider?</i></p><p>He isn\u2019t surprised, not really. Jon\u2019s fate was marked from the moment he was forced to grow up at court under the King\u2019s protection. And what protection was it? It isn\u2019t a shield, something that has protected him from the whispers, from the looks. A name doesn\u2019t make you less alone when the only boys you grow up with are cruel and derisive and the others too small to understand what is happening, to act. When the adults around you consider you a burden, a stain, something to eradicate. When the only adult who shows you affection is too distracted by the past to pay attention to the present. What can you do if not train yourself to the bone and become a skilled swordsman with Lord Barristan to fill endless afternoons that you wouldn\u2019t know how to spend otherwise? To study and beating yourself up you to show that you are worthy of respect, for them to leave you alone?</p><p>\u201cI have the Stark traits, I was given the name Stark, but I\u2019m not your son, I\u2019m not Brandon\u2019s son. There is another brother, but he is in the Night\u2019s Watch. Fifteen years ago, you came back from Dorne with a child, along with a wet nurse named Wylla and the bones of your sister, after you\u00a0smashed a tower to pieces. Say it,\u201d he orders with a look that could cut. \u201cMy mother\u2019s name. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyanna Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTargaryen,\u201d he corrects him. \u201cLady Dayne wrote something else. Apparently I was never a bastard.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too much information. After days of silence and darkness, it\u2019s happening too much and too fast. He can\u2019t reason. He massages his temple. \u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo give you the opportunity to redeem yourself and do something right. They will kill you. Joffrey may have agreed to pardon you this afternoon, but if it is not today, it will be tomorrow or another day. He will change his mind and go back on his word because that\u2019s what he does, what he likes. You know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes, he knows. He learned it the hard way. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the truth. Say what you discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is honor also in the way we die. It will allow us to buy time.\u201d</p><p>(I reached the word limit so I leave the link where to find it complete.)</p><p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F19070323&amp;t=NzAzYjhjYmU4NzI5OWVmODJlMjk2NjgyNzNjODA0NTM2OTU0NmJlNiwyNjk0NjE0M2VlNzNiMmZlOTE0MzA1Y2FiODYwYTkzMTY0MDliZmEy\",\"display_url\":\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19070323\",\"title\":\"\\n        The flight of youth - Ruta - A Song of Ice and Fire - George R.

                "content": "<p><b>The flight of youth</b></p><p>(AU in which Jon grows up in King&rsquo;s Landing as Robert&rsquo;s ward and Brandon&rsquo;s legitimized bastard.)</p><p>i</p><p>Ned strides out of the Tower of Joy, a screaming child into his arms and the smell of his sister&rsquo;s blood marked upon his skin.</p><p>He rides day and night, the only stops are those to allow the wet nurse to feed the child. He has no name, not yet.</p><p><i>Raise him like he&rsquo;s yours. Protect him.</i> These were Lyanna&rsquo;s last words. It&rsquo;s what he promised and he will do.</p><p>Thoughts assail him in moments of forced quiet, in slumber, gnawing at his soul like rats.</p><p>During the night, when everything is dark and there is no glimmer of light, the burden of the secret and the consequences of his promise weigh heavily on his mind.</p><p>What will people think when they see him return after the war with a bastard in his arms? What will Catelyn think?</p><p>The thought of his wife, of the fragile hopes he had placed in their marriage, the feeling that they had reached an understanding, the certainty of being able to build something together little by little. If not love, at least a relationship of friendship, respect, trust, devotion.</p><p>He keenly feels the loss of what could have been and never will be.</p><p>*</p><p>His precautions don&rsquo;t matter. In the end Robert tracks him.</p><p>(Two days ago he arrived at King&rsquo;s Landing to find the Mad King in a pool of his own blood, to discover the cruel brutality of Elia Martell and her sons deaths.)</p><p>He is not ready, he never will be. Lying is difficult for him. Lying to the boy with whom he grew up and that is like a brother to him seems impossible. It&rsquo;s dishonorable and wrong, but he knows Robert and knows that Lyanna&rsquo;s fear was legitimate. If Robert had the slightest doubt, if he suspected something, it would be the end. It would mean fury and ruin. Too much blood has already been spilled.</p><p>Now or never, he thinks.</p><p>Robert observes the child in his arms and for the first time in the last year it seems that the storm raging at the bottom of his clear eyes subsides. The frenzy that not even Raeghar&rsquo;s death managed to extinguish disappears, buried behind the shadow of a smile that peeks out from his long and bristly beard.</p><p>Ned lets Robert take the child and already feels the absence of his familiar weight against the chest, similar to an amputation.</p><p>He watches as he cradle him, a small and screaming bundle pressed against a mighty chest. Robert still wears his armor and is covered in mud and encrusted blood. Jon doesn&rsquo;t seem to care. He stops crying and in the sudden silence the ringing in his ears becomes the only noise inside the tent. He feels suffocated. The scorching sun of Dorne is far away and so are the desert lands that he has crossed like a man damned by the gods. If he closes his eyes, however, he can still feel the stifling heat of the room in which he found Lyanna, the stench of death.</p><p>&ldquo;Cat will never accept him,&rdquo; says Robert. He&rsquo;s tickling Jon&rsquo;s chin. &ldquo;This will destroy your marriage.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s the truth and perhaps it was the awareness of this that stole his sleep and peace. Not the memory of the dead, but the torment of the living, knowing the battle that awaits him within the walls of his house.</p><p>&ldquo;Give him to me, Ned. Give me your boy and I&rsquo;ll raise him as if he were mine. He will be my ward. The war took Lyanna from me. I won the war for a wolf.&rdquo;</p><p>He wakes up from a nightmare to find himself catapulted into another.</p><p>Now he recognizes the exalted and euphoric expression on Robert&rsquo;s face and hates himself for not immediately noticing. It is the same expression with which he looked at Lyanna, all possessive and fierce tenderness. Lyanna who hated conventions, the restrictions of being a woman. Lyanna who was free and wild and indomitable, but had a kind heart and always dreamed of great adventures, great loves, to live the stories of her favorite books, to become like the heroes of her songs. Lyanna who loved to dance and ride. Lyanna who died, entrusting him with her most precious thing. He is pervaded by an absolute, blinding rage. It is the injustice of everything that has happened to his family. One misfortune after another. And after all that grief, now <i>this</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a trophy, Robert,&rdquo; he says and his voice sounds bitter and terrifying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the life of a child you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;ve sworn to protect him, to keep him safe. On his mother&rsquo;s deathbed, I-&rdquo; he stops abruptly for the horror of what he has just let slip in the heat of the moment. The emotions that have taken over, obscuring the reason. He knows he must have gone pale.</p><p>Robert doesn&rsquo;t flinch. He must have noticed his tension as he must have noticed the suspicious way he stopped talking suddenly.</p><p><i>Gods, let him not understand. Gods, you aren&rsquo;t always just and forgiving. You haven&rsquo;t been with Lyanna. Be with her son.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth.&rdquo; Robert&rsquo;s gaze is open and inquisitive, it seems to pierce him apart. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t yours, is it?&rdquo; Then, like a bolt from the blue, in a thoughtful and unusually serious tone, he asks, &ldquo;Is he Brandon&rsquo;s bastard?&rdquo;</p><p>His surprise twines indissolubly with relief. He thanks all the existing gods, old and new and those who are strangers to him and who have altars of fire, gold and horse bones beyond the Narrow Sea.</p><p>Obviously Robert misunderstands. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that. Did you think I didn&rsquo;t know? People like to talk. So Lady Dayne really committed suicide because of a broken heart.&rdquo; He shakes his head and his sadness is genuine. Probably the idea of &#8203;&#8203;that tragic love reminds him of his own. &ldquo;Poor girl.&rdquo;</p><p>A gurgling verse elicits yet another smile. It is amazing to watch the change, the chasing of lights and shadows on the corners of his angular face. The fierce warrior tamed by a child. Robert touches the delicate and frail curve of Jon&rsquo;s skull. Ned thinks of Aegon Targaryen, of little Rhaenys, of the bloody end of Elia Martell. Of a mad king murdered by one of the knights who had sworn to serve him. Betrayals and oaths, achievements and secrets.</p><p>&ldquo;I can legitimize him,&rdquo; insists Robert. &ldquo;I can give him a title, recognize him as his father&rsquo;s son. You don&rsquo;t need to take responsibility for him, atone for a sin not yours.&rdquo;</p><p>On the contrary, the sin is also his. He didn&rsquo;t arrive in time. He failed to save Lyanna. He sighs and that simple gesture seems to deprive him of any residual energy. He feels incredibly tired and old. &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; He asks. &ldquo;You said that Jon would destroy my marriage. What about yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; echoes Robert&rsquo;s voice, starstruck. &ldquo;You fucking bastard. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to call one of my boys like that.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Me too</i>. &ldquo;Answer the question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want me to say? I will never love any woman as I loved Lyanna, but my wife will be queen. This will have to be enough and she will have to accept Jon Stark, whether she likes it or not.&rdquo;</p><p>He knows it&rsquo;s a gamble. He should prevent it from happening. Make excuses.</p><p>Robert continues to smile at the son of the man he hates. The man he killed for revenge and to pay off a debt of pride.</p><p>He is trapped.</p><p><i>Lyanna, forgive me.</i></p><p>*</p><p>The news travels fast, carried by raven&rsquo;s wings propelled by strong winds.</p><p>The new King has a ward. An orphan and a bastard whom he has already legitimized.</p><p>When he returns home, Ned is a changed man, hopelessly different from the man he was before he left for the war. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he? The war took away everything from him. His father, his brother, his sister. His honor.</p><p>He returns to discover that Benjen intends to take the black and that his mother has slowly gone out, the most romantic say for the heartbreak of having survived the death of her family. But he knew her, strengths and weaknesses. It wasn&rsquo;t despair and mourning that killed her, but anger, bitterness, a burning hatred. His mother was a strong and passionate woman, but even the hardest stone can break under the right pressure.</p><p>He comes back to discover that his wife, whose colors he knows, but not the most intimate thoughts, meanwhile gave birth to a male child. A healthy and robust child. She called him Robb and he thinks he loves her a little for that.</p><p>In the chambers that belonged to his father and mother and which now belong to him and Catelyn, Ned holds his first child. Blood of his blood. Partly Stark partly Tully.</p><p>Motherhood has made Catelyn radiant. It made her flourish again. She must miss terribly the great rivers and the expanses of grass covered with dew, the exterminated fields, the wild flowers. A part of her must hate this hard and cold land where nothing pretty grows, where everything is white or dark, covered with moss.</p><p>She&rsquo;s trying to adapt. She wants to learn to be happy here with him. She set aside the elaborate braids and garments with gaudy tones. Now she is the portrait of sobriety and composure. Only her hair shines like red gold against the fire in the fireplace and so does Robb&rsquo;s.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t welcome him with a hug, but when they were alone and he sought the reassuring warmth of her body, she let him attract her against him and reciprocated his embrace with equal force.</p><p>I&rsquo;m home, he thought. This is my home now.</p><p>While nursing Robb, Catelyn is careful to ask general questions about the South, about Robert. Neither of them speak of the deads, the spoils of war. Nevertheless the argument cannot be avoided. When he mentions Jon Stark, he sees the pain in his wife&rsquo;s sky blue eyes and can&rsquo;t stand it. In his case it would have been humiliation and wounded pride. In Brandon&rsquo;s case it is something profoundly different. No matter how, Catelyn loved him. Discovering that she has been betrayed remains a severe blow, a sour bite to swallow. She reacts stoically, but her features are expressionless, her eyes cold and dry, her shoulders stiff, the crease of her thin mouth is decidedly unhappy.</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to build the foundation of their marriage on a lie.</p><p>In another situation he would have acted differently. Not in this one. In this Jon has already been lost and he failed to protect him as he should have.</p><p>He kneels in front of his wife and taking her hand, in a broken whisper, briefly tells her about a bed soaked with blood and the last words of a beloved sister lost in the worst way, the forbidden love of a wolf and a dragon, of a child guilty only of being born on the side of the losers at the end of a war that made him an orphan.</p><p>In the end, Ned isn&rsquo;t the only one crying.</p><p>Robb has fallen asleep and his small face is placid and blissful.</p><p>Catelyn looks devastated. &ldquo;Oh, Ned,&rdquo; she whispers softly. She puts her hand against his cheek and he turns his head to kiss her palm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he hears her say. &ldquo;Tell me what I can do. How can I help you.&rdquo;</p><p>There are traces of dry tears on her pale cheeks and new tears are accumulated against her dark eyelashes. She has never seemed more beautiful to him. He has never been so close to feeling something like this. Not a violent passion, but an affection of a piercing, disruptive sweetness that seems to fill the cracks inside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Bear the burden with me,&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;Keep the secret and swear by my gods and yours to never reveal it to anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiles, sad and resolute. She smooths with a finger the worry lines between his eyebrows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Stark secret and I&rsquo;m a Stark now. We&rsquo;re in this together.&rdquo;</p><p>ii</p><p>The King&rsquo;s arrival is welcomed by the procession of the inhabitants of Winterfell gathered in the inner courtyard. It is a triumph of opulence that clashes all the more openly with the austerity of the castle. The Starks are in the front row.</p><p>Ned kneels before Robert and pronounces the usual words, hiding a smile little and badly.</p><p>Robert&rsquo;s eyes betray the same mirth. When he tells him to get up and crush him in a bear hug, he finds in the fat and rowdy man who stands in front of him his oldest and dearest friend.</p><p>The necessary introductions are made. Only a few moments seem to have elapsed when Robert slips his hand below the belt and declares that he wants to go down into the crypts.</p><p>Ned has no choice but to obey.</p><p>He leads the way, after exchanging a look of understanding with Catelyn. Her eyes leave his to stare at a point behind him and he sees a flash of surprise crossing over her face.</p><p>He takes a moment too long to understand and it happens when Robert says, the surliness swept away by a hint of rude kindness, &ldquo;Come with us, boy. I want you to see her. It&rsquo;s your aunt after all.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s the first time he sees his nephew after fourteen years and gods, the resemblance is impressive.</p><p>The shape of the mouth is that of Brandon, only that while his brother&rsquo;s was prone to grins, Jon&rsquo;s seems perpetually sullen, so as the thick and frowned eyebrows are those of his mother.</p><p>The penetrating gray cloud eyes are entirely Lyanna and the way he moves, with determination yet light, reminds him of other ghosts. He is a Stark in every way. There is nothing of his father in him and he knows he must be grateful.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; he says and doesn&rsquo;t know whether to hug him. He is at an age when such gestures are perceived with aversion. It&rsquo;s the same with Robb.</p><p>Jon must read his indecision because he smiles with his eyes, squeezing them slightly as Benjen does when he tries to hold back a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; he greets him with a nod and without another word follows Robert.</p><p>*</p><p>That night, embracing Catelyn in their bed, they comment on their respective days as usual. It&rsquo;s an old habit.</p><p>&ldquo;Rodrick said that during the training Jon disarmed Robb three times.&rdquo; She has her head resting on his shoulder and he caresses her long loose hair, passing it between his fingers like silk ribbons.</p><p>Ned chuckles. &ldquo;I can imagine Robb&rsquo;s reaction.&rdquo;</p><p>Catelyn lightly hits him on the arm. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to laugh about. You know how he becomes when he loses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to talk to him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re kids.&rdquo; She sighs. &ldquo;They are growing. Let them&nbsp;sort things out for themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence that follows is comfortable and relaxing. &ldquo;He resembles her,&rdquo; he mutters in thought. He doesn&rsquo;t need to specify who he is referring to.</p><p>Catelyn is strangely silent. &ldquo;He looks just like you,&rdquo; she finally says with her eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;He looks more like you than your children.&rdquo;</p><p>The idea seems to disturb her. It&rsquo;s true. Among the kids only Arya has inherited his look, the Stark look, but these are mere physical similarities. Robb is stubborn and self-confident, as pungent and charismatic as Brandon was. Sansa and Arya painfully remind him of Lyanna, each in a different way. Bran is reckless and curious, as cheerful as Benjen. Rickon is still too young for him to express an opinion on his character.</p><p>&ldquo;Does it irritate you?&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t respond immediately. Her hand is tight around his tunic, near the heart. She raises her head to look into his eyes. &ldquo;Do you ever think what it would have been like if you had brought him here and raised him as your bastard? If you hadn&rsquo;t told me the truth?&rdquo; He also hears the questions she doesn&rsquo;t dare to pronounce. <i>Do you think we would be where we are now, like this? Would I be able to forgive you for betraying me? Would I have the strength to love you anyway?</i></p><p>He touches her forehead with his lips. &ldquo;Every day,&rdquo; he admits.</p><p>iii</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t the first time that Robert disappoints him, but it is the first time he discovers he cannot forgive him. Sansa&rsquo;s shattering sobs, the anguished way she is embracing her direwolf would melt a heart of stone. Not that of the Queen, nor that of the King, apparently.</p><p>Ned passes an arm around Sansa&rsquo;s shoulders, trying to convince her to let go Lady, but Sansa is stubborn, just like Catelyn and hers is an iron grip. Arya has already run away, probably went to hole up in some corner to cry the tears she held back from the moment the Hound entered the tent with a bloody sword decreeing Mycah&rsquo;s death.</p><p>Ned knows what to do, even if the thought fills him with revulsion.</p><p>Then it happens.</p><p>Jon steps forward and kneels in front of Robert. No matter how awkward he may appear, he moves with lethal grace. Ned saw him sparring, saw the easy camaraderie he established with Robb during his stay in Winterfell (his son is impulsive and impetuous and proud, but he knows how to recognize his mistakes and after the first defeats, it was him who sought Jon&rsquo;s company, who asked him to train together), he knows that even the Kingslayer takes pleasure in their swordplay. Looking at the inflexible line of his back, Ned doesn&rsquo;t know what to think. He doesn&rsquo;t understand Jon, he doesn&rsquo;t know him. His nephew, with his silences and the constant frown that never leaves his forehead. His nephew who always wears black and brown leathers. Introverted, but not shy. Usually a boy of few words, a silent&nbsp;observer.</p><p>&ldquo;Your grace,&rdquo; Jon says, his head dutifully bowed, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m allowed to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it, boy,&rdquo; replies Robert, but there is no real bite in his cursing, only blatant fondness. &ldquo;Every time this spiel of&nbsp;obsequious banter. If you want to talk, then talk. You don&rsquo;t have to ask my permission.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon gets up with a fluid movement and when he talks it&rsquo;s like hearing Lyanna, her incurable thirst for justice. &ldquo;Lady Sansa&rsquo;s direwolf is innocent and so was the boy. This is not the King&rsquo;s justice. It is only revenge ruled by anger.&rdquo;</p><p>Robert runs his hand over his beard, listening intently. Standing at his side the Queen&rsquo;s eyes are reduced to two slits yet she remains silent, even if she stares at Jon with open hostility.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you propose, boy? My queen wants blood. She is a fierce lioness and one of her cubs was wounded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scars are what make a man a warrior. Scars like that&hellip;&rdquo; Jon looks in the direction of Joffrey, of his bandaged arm. There is no scorn in his tone, but Ned holds his breath because the meaning behind the words is unmistakable. &ldquo;Any man would show them off with pride. However, he is the prince and he was injured. What happened, regardless of how it happened, is unforgivable. Since the Queen asks for the head of a direwolf, I propose an exchange. Spare that of Lady Sansa and take mine instead.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence and tension are as dense as the morning fog.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon, no,&rdquo; a broken voice whines behind him and Ned catches Sansa&rsquo;s guilty and striken expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asks Robert. &ldquo;There's&nbsp;no coming back from&nbsp;that.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon merely nods. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; says Robert. &ldquo;Ned, see that the sentence is executed. Now go away and leave me alone, all of you. I&rsquo;ve had enough of you troublemakers.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Later, after it&rsquo;s over, Ned watches Jon cover the remains of Ghost with his cloak. The boy&rsquo;s expression is closed and indecipherable.</p><p>Ned puts a hand on his shoulder and is surprised when Jon allows it. He&rsquo;s probably too distracted by what happened and hasn&rsquo;t even noticed it.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bury him in the north,&rdquo; he promises.</p><p>This seems to awaken Jon. He blinks. &ldquo;I wish for him to be buried with Lady Lyanna.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned must fight against the sudden lump in his throat before speaking. &ldquo;It will be done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Queen will not be satisfied,&rdquo; Jon says after a moment. &ldquo;You have to send Lady away. Get her back to Winterfell. There she will be safe.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned had hoped that was the end, but he realizes that it was foolish of him to think so. Death calls for death, blood wants more blood. He&rsquo;s just surprised that Jon, so young, has already learned this lesson. Not for the first time, he wonders what Jon had to endure, the kind of childhood he had.</p><p>What happened in the King&rsquo;s tent, the exchange of words and looks he witnessed. He lets the hand fall to his side. What right does he have to comfort Lyanna&rsquo;s boy right now? </p><p>&ldquo;In there,&rdquo; he says and Jon turns. &ldquo;You knew what would happen.&rdquo;</p><p>It is clear that Jon knows what he is referring to by the way he avoids his gaze and is mulling over how to respond, weighing the words and deciding what to admit.</p><p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t my family, but I grew up with them,&rdquo; he says and it is a painful, bitter truth. A purulent and rodent wound just as much for him as it must be for Jon. Lyanna&rsquo;s eyes stare at him from his grave face, accusers and sad, as if they knew, as if he understood the extent of his guilt. <i>How did you protect him? How did you keep your oath? Throwing him to the lions</i>.</p><p>The moment passes. Jon shrugs, unperturbed. &ldquo;I know how they think, what they feel. Sometimes it seems like I know them more and better than I know myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned thinks back to the time when in the crypts, after Robert&rsquo;s proposal to join their families, Jon didn&rsquo;t immediately follow the King. He stared intently at Lyanna&rsquo;s sculpted face while Ned thought, <i>you won&rsquo;t know the sound of her laughter. You will never hear her sing to robins. You will not know of the pranks she used to play at&nbsp;the expense of lords and servants, how her laughter was able to dissolve any resentment or animosity towards her afterwards, making her earn forgiveness and love from anyone who knew her.</i></p><p>Jon advised him to wait. An engagement is for life. He remembers what he told him as if not a single day had passed, so deeply it struck him. &ldquo;Let them know each other, let them fall in love. Let them live the fairy tale. Give her a choice. Make her choose to get married because that&rsquo;s what she wants and not what she thinks she wants.&rdquo;</p><p>He knows Joffrey&rsquo;s temperament, he knows how he is. It is as he said. He grew up with them. Those people are not his family, but he knows how they think, how they behave.</p><p>He averted a catastrophe. After what he saw, he will never consent to a marriage between Sansa and Joffrey Baratheon.</p><p>iv</p><p>&ldquo;The boy can&rsquo;t become King,&rdquo; says Robert. He refused the milk of poppy. His face is swollen and red, veiled with sweat. He has a fever. The wound infected and must hurt like seven hells. Nevertheless he seems lucid and more than ever like the man he loved as a boy, not the dissolute and careless King he has known in recent months.</p><p>In light of the discovery about the real parentage of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen, Ned says nothing.</p><p>Robert punches the mattress. &ldquo;Joffrey,&rdquo; he says his son&rsquo;s name as if it tasted disgusting, as if he wanted to spit it out. &ldquo;He cannot be King. He isn&rsquo;t suitable. He doesn&rsquo;t have the makings for governing.&rdquo; He twitches the eyes and it seems that the pain is getting worse because he is panting&nbsp;heavily. &ldquo;Jon was right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; What does Jon have to do with all this?</p><p>Robert opens his eyes instantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good boy. Diligent. Quiet. Well-mannered. He looks more like you than his father.&rdquo; He bursts out laughing and as often happens is a laugh at the expense of the world, for a joke he doesn&rsquo;t intend to share, which only he seems capable of fully understanding. &ldquo;A year ago he tried to talk to me. He wanted to convince me to issue an edict to name Tommen as crown prince. Obviously I didn&rsquo;t listen to him. You should have seen him, Ned.&rdquo; The smile that curves his mouth, supplanting the grimace of pain, is a smile that Ned remembers well. It has the taste of youth, of spring, of tournaments and winter roses, of dances and banquets.</p><p>&ldquo;It was like she was talking to me. Lyanna. He had exactly her look. Do you remember her look? When she stuck to something and wanted to convince you to think the same way at all costs. It made you feel like slime in the channels, like she was ready to hit you if you dared to contradict her.&rdquo; Robert&rsquo;s eyes are shiny and wistful. &ldquo;May the gods forgive me. I loved the boy as a son, more than my own. For years I imagined that he was her boy&rsquo;s, the son that she would have given me if everything had gone as it should have been. I saw him grow up and it was like seeing you and her again, mixed up. He would be a good King, a great one. He doesn&rsquo;t have my blood and he has no right to the crown, but if I could I would recognize him as my heir right now.&rdquo;</p><p>But he has it, Ned thinks. He could be King and he would have more right than those you consider your children.</p><p>&ldquo;He would hate it.&rdquo; Robert bursts out laughing again. He holds his chest with both hands as if it hurt, but he doesn&rsquo;t stop laughing. It only ends when he is out of breath. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;He would hate it like I did. Like he hates this place. I wronged him. I should have send him north years ago. I was fucking selfish, but I loved him. As much as I loved her. My Queen of Love and Beauty.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>After his offer to let her and the children survive, when Cersei asks the inevitable question, the answers could be multiple. Honor, which requires not to claim innocent victims. Mercy, because now he can imagine precisely how difficult life must have been as the wife and queen of Robert. In the end the truth prevails. &ldquo;For Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She frowns. She is a beautiful woman and if Robert had been a better man, a man capable of letting go the past and above all the idealized image of a dead girl, perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to have this conversation now, to do what the duty towards his king and the realm impose on him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been kind to him. He has every reason to hate me. If he knew what you discovered-&rdquo;</p><p>And this is perhaps the most difficult part. To know that the boy he had sworn to protect grew up in this nest of vipers. Lonely because of the King&rsquo;s love. Far away from the affection of the family that would have welcomed him and loved him, not a perfect love, but as indestructible as the Wall, vast and deep as the depths of the sea.</p><p>&ldquo;He already knows,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;He always knew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ridiculous,&rdquo; she says scornfully, but the doubt is sprouting. He can see the cracks in her mask, in her demeanor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He hindered Jon Arryn&rsquo;s research and he was the one who covered you for years. He made sure that Robert&rsquo;s bastards left the city discreetly, paying to cover their escape. The only one left is a blacksmith and just because I beat him to it.&rdquo;</p><p>Now she seems distraught. &ldquo;Why should he have?&rdquo; She isn&rsquo;t looking at him, as if the question was addressed more to herself than to him. As if she had forgotten his presence, the sword hanging over her head, so great and shocking is the surprise of what he told her.</p><p>Even if this is the case, he answers the same, feeling his heart break exactly like the first time he put the threads together, at Robert&rsquo;s deathbed, &ldquo;Because you are the only mother he has known for all his life and through you he discovered a woman&rsquo;s love for her children, even if was never directed towards him.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>The cell where they locked him up is dark and cold. He survived worse things. The only torture is not knowing what happened to Sansa and Arya. And Jon. </p><p><i>Gods, what have I done?</i></p><p>After what he told the Queen, there is no way he can have survived. At best he was thrown into a cell similar to his.</p><p>When the door opens, hours, days, months later, Ned has to shield his eyes. The light of the torch that one of the two men has in his hand is blinding. He cannot make out their faces, only the blurred contours of their figures.</p><p>The taller man gives the torch to the other and kneels beside him. &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; he says and for the first time in years Ned feels like he might cry.</p><p>He tries to talk, but all he can produce is a strangled cry. His mouth is dry, his lips like leaves about to crumble.</p><p>He tries again and croaks, &ldquo;Sansa? Arya?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fine,&rdquo; Jon reassures him and hands him a wineskin. Ned drinks greedily as Jon continues to update him on recent events, &ldquo;Arya disappeared the day you were imprisoned. She must have escaped. Sansa,&rdquo; Jon hesitates imperceptibly, avoiding his gaze, &ldquo;she is fine.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned grabs him by the wrist. &ldquo;What are you not telling me?&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment it looks like Jon doesn&rsquo;t want to tell him. Whatever it is, he doesn&rsquo;t like it. No matter how terrible it is, he wants to know, he must. Jon seems to understand because he nods slowly. He turns to the second man and finally Ned recognizes him.</p><p>Lord Varys comes forward and begins to speak, revealing what Jon would have preferred to keep to himself, &ldquo;This morning Lady Sansa implored the King to spare you and the King graciously consented for the sincere love that binds him to your daughter. He will pardon you and allow you to join the Night&rsquo;s Watch, as long as you admit your betrayal to the whole Court and that Joffrey is the true King. As a friend, I strongly advise you to accept the offer. Doing so would protect your daughter. She could even be queen one day.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what worries and disgusts him more, if the shame that Sansa pleaded for him, kneeling at the foot of the iron throne in an attempt to save him or that one day she could be married to the monster that is Joffrey Lannister.</p><p>His opinion on the matter must be evident because Lord Varys sighs, a sigh of regret, as if with it he wants to express that despite everything he tried and that if he failed the fault is not attributable to him.</p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t pardon you,&rdquo; Jon says unexpectedly.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; He asks without thinking. Then remember who he&rsquo;s talking to.</p><p>The smile that Jon gives him is empty and doesn&rsquo;t reach his eyes.<i> Because I know him,</i> he is saying. <i>Because I grew up with him. Because I know things you don&rsquo;t know and you&rsquo;ll never know.</i></p><p>Ned takes his head in his hands. For the first time in his life he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do, what to say. All he can think of is that he will die. It&rsquo;s a matter of hours, maybe days. He feels no fear, only regret. The regret of leaving Sansa alone and helpless and practically ad a captive of the Lannister. The regret of not seeing Catelyn again and not seeing the boys grow up. The regret of not having a future, of not being able to savor the old age they had dreamed of, gray and old and surrounded by grandchildren. There is a regret, however, that he can remedy. A thorn deep in his heart and that he could finally eliminate.</p><p>&ldquo;Your mother-&rdquo; begins and maybe it&rsquo;s an impression, but Jon looks pale, his face white as bone. He&rsquo;s just a boy, he thinks suddenly. I shouldn&rsquo;t give him this burden. He isn&rsquo;t ready, not yet. After all, the secret will not die with him. Catelyn is the next keeper.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jon interrupts him firmly, but not without a certain amount of kindness.</p><p>He knows? &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you know I grew up thinking I was your son?&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like Jon to answer a question with another question. However, the absurdity of what he has just said makes his mind white and bleakly empty.</p><p>He looks just like you, Ned recalls Catelyn&rsquo;s voice. More than your children.</p><p>He would like for it to be true. He would like not to have accepted Robert&rsquo;s proposal and would have liked to have torn him from his arms with force, to hell with the consequences. He would like Jon to have grown up in Winterfell, protected, loved, safe. He would like hundreds of things, but here, at the mouth of the seven hells, while death looks him in the face through the eyes of his sister, he cannot lie.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your father,&rdquo; he says, every word scratching his throat.</p><p>Jon looks at his hands, his face in shadow. &ldquo;Now I know.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t sound surprised. &ldquo;I knew since I met you. Since I saw how you treat your children. I&rsquo;m trying to be honest because-&rdquo; he swallows, running out of words.</p><p>Ned has never seen him so nervous, agitated. Even when he lost his direwolf he didn&rsquo;t react this way. Jon is usually calm, prudent, cautious. Not right now. He appears young and worried, as if he isn&rsquo;t the master of his emotions and the newness destabilizes him, makes him uncertain about how to proceed.</p><p>Ned lets him regain control. He feels he owes him at least this. Ti decide how he want to face the truth about himself. The choice is his. He will respect it, whatever it is. Not for duty or honor, but because it is right.</p><p>&ldquo;Growing up with this face, knowing that I looked more like you than my supposed father&hellip;&rdquo; Jon takes a deep breath and meets his gaze with the expression of someone about to face a battle. &ldquo;The King liked to talk about your years together in the Vale. Lord Arryn would have preferred him to do it more discreetly. I never understood why he didn&rsquo;t like me, until one day I did. I understood. He believed what everyone believed. That you were my real father and that to cover up your disgrace you had asked Robert to help you. A loophole. For years I believed you were my father, that you couldn&rsquo;t bear my sight to the point of praying the King to take me as ward. I thought of you, in your castle of stone and snow, picturing how it would be like to have brothers and sisters, if you loved me at least a little or if I was just that to you, the perpetual memory of a moment of weakness, of your shame.&rdquo;</p><p><i>My dear boy. What have I done?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Robert legitimized you,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Jon nods, but it&rsquo;s a gesture with no real meaning. &ldquo;A bastard remains a bastard even with a different name. I&rsquo;ve never been a Stark, not really, otherwise why would I have been forced to grow up here? Even if it wasn&rsquo;t an exile, it seemed like that to me.&rdquo;</p><p>When he is silent, obsessively staring at the wall, Ned observes his shining eyes and feels overcome by impotence, by a raw despair, a roaring wrath.</p><p>&ldquo;During the tournament in your honor I met Edric Dayne,&rdquo; Jon continues to talk. &ldquo;He is Lord Dondarrion&rsquo;s squire. He seemed surprised by my questions about Lady Ashara. He couldn&rsquo;t understand the reasons. He was convinced that my mother&rsquo;s name was Wylla. She was his wet nurse. He told me we were milk brothers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was also yours for a short time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to think anymore.&rdquo; Jon runs his hand through his hair. Ned can imagine what he must have felt, the frustration of not knowing and the need to discover the truth, vital and necessary. &ldquo;By then I was sure you weren&rsquo;t my father. I knew you. I had seen the kind of man you were. Isn&rsquo;t it ironic?&rdquo; Jon laughs. It sounds depressing, bitterly disappointed. &ldquo;When I wanted you to be my father, I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t possible. I wasn&rsquo;t yours, so I really had to be Brandon&rsquo;s son. My mother&rsquo;s mystery remained. Who was she? I wrote to Lady Allyria Dayne. She confirmed my suspicions. Her sister had given birth during the Rebellion, it was true, but a stillborn, a girl. Wylla had been my nurse, she loved me like a mother, but she didn&rsquo;t give birth to me. I wasn&rsquo;t who I thought I was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have written her,&rdquo; he reproaches him more forcefully than strictly necessary. &ldquo;It was a risky and dangerous move. What would have happened if someone had intercepted the missive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have the means,&rdquo; Jon responds, minimizing, but his eyes unknowingly move to the left, where Lord Varys is. </p><p><i>Since when? When did you start weaving plots and collaborating with the Spider?</i></p><p>He isn&rsquo;t surprised, not really. Jon&rsquo;s fate was marked from the moment he was forced to grow up at court under the King&rsquo;s protection. And what protection was it? It isn&rsquo;t a shield, something that has protected him from the whispers, from the looks. A name doesn&rsquo;t make you less alone when the only boys you grow up with are cruel and derisive and the others too small to understand what is happening, to act. When the adults around you consider you a burden, a stain, something to eradicate. When the only adult who shows you affection is too distracted by the past to pay attention to the present. What can you do if not train yourself to the bone and become a skilled swordsman with Lord Barristan to fill endless afternoons that you wouldn&rsquo;t know how to spend otherwise? To study and beating yourself up you to show that you are worthy of respect, for them to leave you alone?</p><p>&ldquo;I have the Stark traits, I was given the name Stark, but I&rsquo;m not your son, I&rsquo;m not Brandon&rsquo;s son. There is another brother, but he is in the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Fifteen years ago, you came back from Dorne with a child, along with a wet nurse named Wylla and the bones of your sister, after you&nbsp;smashed a tower to pieces. Say it,&rdquo; he orders with a look that could cut. &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s name. Say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lyanna Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Targaryen,&rdquo; he corrects him. &ldquo;Lady Dayne wrote something else. Apparently I was never a bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s too much information. After days of silence and darkness, it&rsquo;s happening too much and too fast. He can&rsquo;t reason. He massages his temple. &ldquo;Why are you telling me all this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To give you the opportunity to redeem yourself and do something right. They will kill you. Joffrey may have agreed to pardon you this afternoon, but if it is not today, it will be tomorrow or another day. He will change his mind and go back on his word because that&rsquo;s what he does, what he likes. You know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p><p>Yes. Yes, he knows. He learned it the hard way. &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell the truth. Say what you discovered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is honor also in the way we die. It will allow us to buy time.&rdquo;</p><p>(I reached the word limit so I leave the link where to find it complete.)</p><p data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F19070323&amp;t=NzAzYjhjYmU4NzI5OWVmODJlMjk2NjgyNzNjODA0NTM2OTU0NmJlNiwyNjk0NjE0M2VlNzNiMmZlOTE0MzA1Y2FiODYwYTkzMTY0MDliZmEy&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://archiveofourown.org/works/19070323&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;\\n        The flight of youth - Ruta - A Song of Ice and Fire - George R.

She started out so naive and was forced to\nundergo the most brutal possible education into the world but emerged from it\nand became this powerful figure and kind of against all odds. I don&rsquo;t think too\nmany people watching the first season had any expectation that Sansa would\nbecome the woman that she became. And part of that is the story and part of\nthat is Sophie Turner and the phenom she turned out to be as an actress. We\nknew when we cast Sophie that she was this really good child actor but we had\nno idea she&rsquo;d become the force that&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s become.

I had so much\nfun working with her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sophie has a beautiful stillness to her as an actor\nthat&rsquo;s incredibly rare. From the start as a very young girl she had such\ndiscipline. One minute she could be dancing and singing a musical number and\nthe instant they are camera ready she can flip the switch and dig so deep\nemotionally. That&rsquo;s a gift.&rdquo;</p><p><b>\n\nPedro Pascal\n\n</b><br /></p><p>&ldquo;[On the funniest actor behind\nthe scenes]&nbsp;Oh my god, so\nmany of them are so funny. The entire cast is very very witty and a fun cast,\nso this is very hard to choose, but I guess something that people might not\nexpect is that Sophie Turner had me in stitches a lot of the time. I&rsquo;m not sure\nif she was trying to be funny but she was still making me laugh.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Lena Headey </b></p><p>&ldquo;Sophie&rsquo;s confidence has grown, and rightly so.

Neither Arya nor Gendry had mentioned anything about intensive exercise. She looks at her trainers&ndash; normal sneakers, not hiking boots, and with shorter socks. She&rsquo;d picked out an outfit that was mildly athletic, knowing they were meeting at a park, but it was also more cute than functional. </p><p>But how bad could it be? Mya knew this was a first date, and she highly doubted Arya thought they&rsquo;d be a good match based on Sansa&rsquo;s athleticism. </p><p>&ldquo;I should be alright,&rdquo; she answers carefully.</p><p>Mya smiles, and she rather likes it. &ldquo;Good! Follow me, and I&rsquo;ll point out some of the wildlife as we go, too.&rdquo;</p><p>It was unconventional as a first date, but Sansa had been on worse, so she decided to see this through.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>This is the largest mistake she&rsquo;s ever made. </p><p>Her feet are aching from uneven and rocky terrain, her shins scratched up from sticks and shrubs. Her entire body is drenched in sweat, and she knows that she&rsquo;s starting to go pink under the sun. Mya, meanwhile, looks refreshed and happy&ndash;the only sign of exertion a slight red tinge to her cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a mockingbird-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Sansa finally snaps, her body exhausted and patience gone. It&rsquo;s been <i>three hours</i>. Three! Hours! Of hiking, of her date&rsquo;s main conversation being about fauna, and Sansa is positive she&rsquo;s going to murder her little sister once she gets home (if she gets home). </p><p>Mya pauses, looking rather taken aback. <i>Good</i>, Sansa thinks, a little uncharitably, but that will happen when one&rsquo;s first date was in the middle of a bloody mountain. </p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to rest?&rdquo; She offers, hesitant. &ldquo;I know the altitude can make some people dizzy-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I want is to know why you thought this was a good idea for a first date,&rdquo; Sansa says, more cross than angry now. </p><p>A long silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, this was a <i>date</i>?&rdquo; Mya&rsquo;s eyes are wide, lips parted&ndash;she looks horrified. </p><p>And Sansa can feel her temper flare up again. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t want to, I would have been happy to <i>not</i> climb a mountain-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No no no,&rdquo; Mya says quickly, waving her hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that at all. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; She presses the heel of her hand to her forehead. Lets go of a long, frustrated sigh. &ldquo;My <i>idiot</i> brother said you wanted to see the mountain. I thought you were a customer.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa stares at her. She stares back, her ears going pinker than her cheeks.</p><p>And then the snort, loud and unladylike, escapes. With it, so does her anger. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I feel better or worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s worse, we can kill him together,&rdquo; Mya offers, genuinely mortified</p><p>Sansa seriously considers it, what with all the strained muscles and scratched up shins and trainers now ruined beyond repair, but decides it would ultimately upset Arya. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it to the top, and see how I feel after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Mya blinks, surprised. &ldquo;You want to keep going?&rdquo;</p><p>She nods, and feeling bold but also like she wants to make sure Mya knows this was a date, grabs her hand. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there, might as well see it.&rdquo; Sansa sends her a slow look. &ldquo;Also now that you know it&rsquo;s a date, and are not trying to kill me with high altitude cardio, I might as well see that, too.&rdquo;</p><p>After a moment, Mya grins, flexing her fingers around Sansa&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spoil you too much, but I do have several granola bars and whey shakes ready for a romantic lunch.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa wrinkles her nose. &ldquo;Gendry is paying for a real dinner, next time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next time?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa lets out a little laugh. &ldquo;This hardly counts, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Mya smiles. Sansa smiles back.</p><p>-</p><p>Mya was right. The view really is spectacular. </p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>When Arya said she had someone she wanted to set Sansa up with, she&rsquo;d been hesitant. Even more so when she was told it was Arya&rsquo;s boyfriend&rsquo;s sister. It wasn&rsquo;t that she disliked Gendry, exactly, but he was often silent, scowling, and impatient with nearly everyone but Arya. Naturally, Sansa&rsquo;s mental image of this date was that she would look and act exactly like him. Maybe with longer hair.<br /></p>\n<p>But Sansa had been pleasantly surprised when she pulled up to the park entrance where Mya worked. She&rsquo;d been wrong about the longer hair, and there was a certain similarity in appearance, but Mya had a large smile and an immediately friendly way about her that put Sansa at ease. </p>\n</p>",
