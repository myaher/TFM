Dex understood that Jedi lived strange and different\nlives and would accept the concept of a time traveler who was a\nlittle bit damaged by his trip through time.</p><p>And\nObi-Wan had been right about that, Dex, once the situation had been\nexplained to him, had thrown all four arms around Ben and hugged him\nwithout pulling him off his feet, clearly aware of old aching joints\nand then pulled Ben into the diner while rattling off the menu and\nasking if Ben still ate various items that Obi-Wan enjoyed.</p><p>Anakin\nand Obi-Wan had left after that, promising to come collect the time\ntraveler after about two hours or when the other called if Ben wanted\nto leave early. But for the last ten minutes Ben could swear someone\nwas watching him&hellip; \n</p><p>&lsquo;Am\nI being paranoid?&rsquo; Ben blinked, finishing off his second cup of tea\nthat Dex had said was on the house along with the coral fries. Well he was Force addled, he was aware that something wasn&rsquo;t quite right with him but he couldn&rsquo;t quite focus enough to correct it honestly.</p><p>Quietly he brushed away the sensation of being watched.<br /></p><p>()()()</p><p>Frowning\nwhile setting the binoculars aside, Asajj rubbed her chin slowly with\na deep frown on her face.</p><p>She\nhad been watching the old man for days now, this strangely soft Jedi.</p><p>He\nwas familiar.</p><p>But\nshe couldn&rsquo;t put her finger on it though maybe it could be waved\naway that apparently he had a family connection to Kenobi considering\nhis name the same. But&hellip; \n</p><p>&lsquo;He\nreminds me of Ky&hellip;&rsquo; Her heart throbbed at the reminder of her Jedi\nmaster, remembering the kind pale green and gentle smile. The man who\nhad saved her from slavery and made her strong until he <i>died</i>\nin her arms.</p><p>Pulling\nher hood up when the rain started to fall on Coruscant, Asajj lifted\nher binoculars again to continue watching the white haired human. \n</p><p>&lsquo;He\nhas a kind smile too, just like Ky did&hellip; he&rsquo;s softer though. How\ncan he be any kind of threat to the Sith or the CSI?&rsquo; Asajj\nwondered with a deep frown before growling to herself. She had never\nhad any issue attacking a Jedi before!</p><p>&lsquo;But\nnone of them have been soft and kind have they?&rsquo; A small voice\nwhispered quietly in the back of her mind. &lsquo;Look at him, he&rsquo;s\nconfused and quiet.
