She smiles brightly. \u201cHello Win!\u201d She\nsays. \u201cReady to go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d </p><p>As they walk,\nthey talk about everything in between. Weather, their sons, flowers, and\ngroceries. Winnie says that general brand is as good as name brand, don\u2019t let\nanything about it fool you. \u201cSome people can taste the difference, but I doubt\nTony will care,\u201d she says. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna get a cart and go.\u201d </p><p>Maria picks\nup a lot of things. She picks up a jar of blackberry preserves for breakfast,\nsome sauces, spices, fruits, and vegetables. Other basics, but that\u2019s about it.\nShe and Winnie at some products, Winnie reminisces over packing Bucky\u2019s lunch\nfor him every day with a little bag of chips, sandwich, and pudding. Maria\npicks up a box of goldfish, smiling as she remembers when Tony was young. He\nloved the fruit that Jarvis would cut up, the sticky juice running down his\nfingers. It would take him forever to be cleaned up\u2014that boy avoided baths like\nit was his personal job. </p><p>After they\nfinish up grocery shopping, Winnie offers to have Maria over for coffee and\nlunch. \u201cI just got this nice arrangement of sandwiches from a coworker and as\ngood as they are, I can\u2019t finish them myself,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cWould\nyou like to have some?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nMaria says. \u201cI\u2019m always ready to eat with you.\u201d Winnie grins, nearly blushing.\n\u201cLet me just put my groceries away, and then I\u2019ll be over to yours, if you\u2019ll\nhave me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nWinnie replies. Maria smiles, ducking into her apartment for a moment. She\u2019s\nquite glad that Winnie can\u2019t see her, because Maria is currently shoving\ngroceries wherever they can fit, and rushing to get the bags back to an orderly\nfashion for her. Tony might text her about the state of the kitchen later, but\nfor now she is going over to Winnie\u2019s house to have coffee and lunch. </p><p>The other\nwoman is currently trying to throw a cheese plate together and failing\u2014she\nforgot to get the damned Colby Jack, best of all\u2014and there\u2019s a polite knock on\nher door. Winnie feels a bit like a mess. \u201cMother of shit,\u201d she curses. \u201cShit,\nshit, shit\u2014\u201d The door opens to Maria looking very much so put together, Winnie\nprobably looks like garbage, and there\u2019s the smell of coffee wafting between\nthe two of them. </p><p>\u201cUh, hello\nMaria. I tried my best to prepare lunch before you came, but there\u2019s only so\nmuch time you have before a lady comes back from putting away her groceries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cVery right,\u201d\nshe says softly with a laugh. \u201cLead the way, Winnie.\u201d </p><p>Winnie\u2019s\nhouse is decorated very nicely. Portraits of the family, those dorky old\noutfits on full display. Maria remembers the shirts that were popular at the\ntime, remembered that she owned a fair amount of them when it was around that time.\nWinnie smiles as she looks at them. </p><p>\u201cJames\u2019\nfather hates these,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I keep them around whenever he visits with\nhis wife.\u201d Maria nods. They head to the kitchen, some sunlight streaming in.\nShe has coordinating cloths, sponges, and the whole scene is perfectly\ndomestic. The black coffeemaker in the back completes it. Maria offers to help\nset the table, and Winnie lets her. They move comfortably in the kitchen as\nMaria navigates it, slowly moving around Winnie. She gets the plates and glasses,\nsetting the latter down on the counter to get water. They bump into each other,\nand Maria tries not to let Winnie see her cheeks heat up, but that\u2019s probably\nimpossible at this point. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Maria\nsays. \u201cWhat kind of coffee do we have, Win?\u201d The casual nickname shouldn\u2019t make\nWinnie smile as much as she\u2019s going to, but she gets out the selection. </p><p>\u201cWe have some\nbreakfast blend, sugar cookie, and\u2026oh god, I don\u2019t even remember getting this\none. Amaretto?\u201d Maria\u2019s eyes brighten at the last one, Winnie laughing. \u201cGuess\nwe\u2019ll go with that one. Get me some coffee cups?\u201d Maria chooses one with\nflowers all over it, the other one an old-fashioned diner cup. Winnie turns\nsuddenly, coming closer into Maria\u2019s space. </p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Maria\nexclaims. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Winnie!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\nthis is a close kitchen,\u201d she says. Also, given that Maria smelled like\nflowers and good things, being in close quarters was literally the best thing\never. </p><p>They get\ntheir coffee, sandwiches, and talk a little bit. Maria is talking about maybe starting\nworking at a bookstore\u2014the owner <i>seriously\n</i>needs some reorganization in the book department as well as some design\nwork. While Maria doesn\u2019t exactly have the best qualifications, she knows that\nshe can prove herself. Winnie encourages it. </p><p>\u201cYou always\nlook so cute, I wouldn\u2019t even question it,\u201d Winnie comments. Maria\u2019s cheeks\nturn pink as she looks down at her coffee. </p><p>\u201cAw, thanks\nWin. You look beautiful too.\u201d Winnie grins, taking another sip of her coffee.\nIt was a good idea to be friends with Maria. She just hoped she didn\u2019t muck it\nup by having actual feelings for her. </p><hr><p>Tony wasn\u2019t\nexactly the best morning person. Sure, he took coffee in the morning and\npractically gulped the whole thing down in five minutes, but that didn\u2019t mean\nmuch. He still looked like he was a walking dead man.<br/></p><p>Steve knew\nthis, and still thought that Tony was one of the cutest guys he\u2019d ever met.\nSteve would grin as Tony swayed out the door, smiling dopily at Steve. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he\u2019d\nmutter, readjusting his backpack. \u201cReady to go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d Steve\nwould reply. \u201cDid you do the English assignment?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout the\u2026was\nit the Middle English?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMiddle\nAges,\u201d Steve corrected. \u201cWe were supposed to be reading more lines from <i>Beowulf.</i>\u201d Tony curses. </p><p>\u201cNo, I\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d Then Steve gives him a basic summary, Tony commits to memory, probably\ngets a better test score than he should\u2014damn that eidetic memory\u2014and all is\nwell. Their lockers are a couple away from each other, so Tony leaves Steve to\ngo put his things away. </p><p>Tony really\nthinks that having a cute neighbor that goes to the same school is just unfair.\nEspecially since Steve is a morning person, goes on a two-mile run every single\nday of his life, and is very, <i>very </i>attractive.\nTony looks roughly like a mess in the morning, which is only worsened by the\ndeath sentence that is school. Just because he can do it doesn\u2019t always mean he\nwants to. Especially this early in the morning, because who the <i>hell </i>even wants to get up early, save\nfor Steve, Bucky, and probably all of Steve\u2019s stupidly-attractive friends. Ugh,\nTony needed more people who couldn\u2019t deal with the morning. </p><p>The day goes\non, Tony making faces at Steve in the hallway, asking him how his day was\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cGoing good.\nHey, you eating with us in the cafeteria?\u201d Steve asks, shoving his math book\ninto his locker. \u201cNatasha wants to verify that you\u2019re a criminal when it comes\nto hydration.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll she has\nto do is wait a week, then see me fall in the middle of AP Chem,\u201d Tony says. </p><p>Steve rolls\nhis eyes and shoves a water bottle at Tony. \u201cDrink, because I have a bet going\nthat you\u2019ll pass out next week and I <i>really\n</i>don\u2019t want to lose five bucks to Nat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Tony\nsays, chugging the water bottle and handing it back. \u201cThanks, Stevie.\u201d </p><p>Natasha\nscowls at Tony as he sits down at the table. \u201cYou\u2019re soft, Carbonell.\u201d </p><p>\u201cComes with\ndrinking water and all that fun jazz,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWhich, by the way, I believe\nyou owe Steve five bucks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSchemer,\u201d\nNatasha mutters, sliding crumpled ones over the table. Steve takes out his\nwallet, putting them in. Tony snickers as he sees the picture of young Steve\nand his mom in a photo booth. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a\ngoofball,\u201d Tony says. \u00a0\u201cLook at that\nstupid shirt you have on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, saying\nyou haven\u2019t done a photo booth thing before, Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Tony\nsays. \u201cI was busy doing other, cooler things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, like\nsinging along to Rosemary Clooney records with your mom?\u201d Steve teases. \u201cWe can\nhear the music, and a screeching voice\u2026\u201d Tony lightly pushes Steve on the arm,\nmaking a noise of protest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nthat you don\u2019t know how amazing Rosemary is, but we have a lot of fun. Maybe\nthis means you won\u2019t be getting any orange chicken tonight.\u201d </p><p>Natasha looks\nbetween the two of them; Steve liked to say that he didn\u2019t fall easily, but\nhere he was. Staring at Tony like he hung up the stars just-so, and Tony was\nsmiling softly as he stole some of Steve\u2019s blueberries when he wasn\u2019t looking. They\nwere in love. Steve was a liar. She\u2019d have to collect on his statement of not\nfalling easily. Maybe after they got together. </p><p>The rest of\nthe day passes without incident for Tony and Steve. Natasha has a class with\nBruce, and they have a substitute teacher, which basically means they\u2019re doing\nnothing. She turns to Bruce, who sits to the right. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nnoticed Steve and Tony too, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRepeat\nthat?\u201d Bruce asks, taking an earbud out. \u201cListening to loud music.\u201d She repeats\nher statement, and he nods as soon as she finishes the sentence. \u201cOh yeah,\ndefinitely. Tony\u2019s head over heels, and always talks about what Steve is going\nto do at home with him. I think this Friday he doesn\u2019t have a football game, so\nmaybe going to the roller rink. I know Steve\u2019s skipping the party. And I think\nTony mentioned having a puzzle night on Saturday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d skip the\nparty to do a puzzle if I knew it was hosted at Rumlow\u2019s house,\u201d Natasha\nmutters. \u201cGod knows how crazy people get over there.\u201d Bruce nods. </p><p>\u201cYeah, real\nasshole guy. Tried to copy my physics work, and got caught because in Mr.\nRainey\u2019s words, \u2018you haven\u2019t been paying enough attention to do this much\ncomplex work.\u2019\u201d Natasha snorts, eyeing the clock. They got out of class in ten\nminutes. Enough time to get started on the actual bookwork, but not enough time\nto actually put any real work into it. Besides, she wants to tell Bruce about\nsome gossip she heard from the cheer squad involving one of the teachers\u2019 past.\n</p><p>Tony waits\nfor Steve to finish football practice, and walks up to him after all the guys\nexit the locker room. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your\nlover boy,\u201d Sam teases Steve. \u201cWaiting for his sweetheart to get out of\npractice, and all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw shut up,\u201d\nSteve says, shoving Sam a little bit. \u201cMakes sense to walk home together. We\nlive in the apartment complex. I think you\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t\nhave actual friends. Me and Bucky don\u2019t count, you\u2019re our charity case.\u201d Sam\nflips Steve off as he pulls out his car keys. </p><p>\u201cThat was\ncold man, straight-up cold. Think I might actually report you to Coach\nPhillips, see what he does.\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably\ncongratulate me,\u201d Steve says. \u201cFinally affected you, dumbass.\u201d Sam grins, bids\nhim goodbye, and Steve looks over to Tony with a soft smile. </p><p>\u201cHey Stevie,\u201d\nTony says. \u201cHow was practice?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSame as\nalways. We went over some plays, yelled at some of the second-strings, and\nlistened to Phillips tell us that just because Ridgemont has a shit team\ndoesn\u2019t mean we can jack around next Friday. You and your mom are still coming,\nright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSitting with\nSarah and everything,\u201d Tony says with a grin. \u201cYou still on for a puzzle\nnight?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nSteve says. \u201cI haven\u2019t done a puzzle in ages.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d\nTony says. \u201cMama picked up a new one, it looks fun. Shows a picture of vintage\ncandy tins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Steve\nresponds, adjusting his backpack. \u201cYou excited for the roller rink?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve\nnever gone to one before,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI don\u2019t even really know if I can skate.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cIf you\ncan\u2019t, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t fall,\u201d Steve teases. \u201cAfter all, you can\u2019t\ncling to the wall the whole time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy knight in\nshining armor,\u201d Tony declares, hand over his heart. \u201cWhatever do I owe you?\u201d Steve\npretends to think for a moment. </p><p>\u201cA skate\ndance when we go, I think.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was going\nto do that anyway,\u201d Tony says, rolling his eyes. \u201cCome on, I bet that Winnie or\nmom is cooking food.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngonna bet, I got a text from your mom that said she\u2019s making garlic bread.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d </p><p>The boys\narrive at Maria\u2019s apartment in a heap of backpacks and jackets and laughs.\nMaria smiles, greeting Steve with a hug and Tony with a kiss on the cheek and a\nreminder to get his laundry folded and put away. </p><p>\u201cYes, Mama!\u201d\nTony calls, slumping to the family room. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m so tired. I had to listen to\nProfessor Reed drone on and on about physics and practicality. Worst class\never.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why do\nyou take it?\u201d Steve asks, slipping in the Mario Kart disc. \u201cI say ditch it and\nfind a more interesting class.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah, I like\nhis reaction when I write my papers dissing his personal theories, it\u2019s\ntherapeutic.\u201d Steve laughs, tossing him a controller. \u201cYou prepared to have\nyour ass kicked in Mushroom Gorge?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly when\nyou admit defeat when I get first place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a\nchallenge.\u201d </p><p>They continue\nplaying, occasionally trash-talking each other. In between, Sarah comes in,\nbearing the ground beef for the spaghetti and some more dishware that she doesn\u2019t\nuse anymore that Maria likes. </p><p>\u201cReady to get\nthat waffle-maker dream out of your head?\u201d Sarah asks. </p><p>\u201cNo,\ndefinitely not,\u201d Maria replies, winking. \u201cPass me the oregano, will you? This needs\na little bit more for the meatballs.\u201d Sarah tosses her the bottle, and they work\nwith relative ease, Sarah humming along to Bob Seger on the radio. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re\nhere, our last neighbor was boring,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cReal old lady who borrowed my\ngood cheese grater and never gave it back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m\nhere, then,\u201d Maria says. \u201cCan you get the boys, it\u2019s nearly dinner time. They\nneed to wash up.\u201d </p><p>Sarah enters\nthe room to hear Steve and Tony arguing about whether or not Mario is actually\ngood. </p><p>\u201cAs\neducational as this is, I\u2019m going to have to have you guys save it for later,\u201d\nSarah says, smiling. \u201cSteve, Tony, wash up. We\u2019re having spaghetti. Tony, could\nyou cut up some fruit for us?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nTony says, giving Sarah a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYour day go okay, Ms. Rogers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nSarah answers. \u201cJust a couple of medical hiccups on paperwork at the hospital.\nI\u2019m just glad I have tomorrow off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBreak time,\u201d\nSteve comments, making his way to the bathroom. </p><p>They\u2019re all\nseated at the table, laughing together as Maria tells them about her grocery\nstore experience. They share knowing looks when she talks about her and Winnie\ngetting coffee. </p><p>\u201cYour mom has\na crush,\u201d Steve mutters to Tony. </p><p>\u201cNo duh,\u201d\nTony murmurs back, smiling and putting another bite of blueberries into his\nmouth before his mother catches him. </p>",

It would take him forever to be cleaned up\u2014that boy avoided baths like\nit was his personal job. </p><p>After they\nfinish up grocery shopping, Winnie offers to have Maria over for coffee and\nlunch. \u201cI just got this nice arrangement of sandwiches from a coworker and as\ngood as they are, I can\u2019t finish them myself,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cWould\nyou like to have some?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nMaria says. \u201cI\u2019m always ready to eat with you.\u201d Winnie grins, nearly blushing.\n\u201cLet me just put my groceries away, and then I\u2019ll be over to yours, if you\u2019ll\nhave me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nWinnie replies. Maria smiles, ducking into her apartment for a moment. She\u2019s\nquite glad that Winnie can\u2019t see her, because Maria is currently shoving\ngroceries wherever they can fit, and rushing to get the bags back to an orderly\nfashion for her. Tony might text her about the state of the kitchen later, but\nfor now she is going over to Winnie\u2019s house to have coffee and lunch. </p><p>The other\nwoman is currently trying to throw a cheese plate together and failing\u2014she\nforgot to get the damned Colby Jack, best of all\u2014and there\u2019s a polite knock on\nher door. Winnie feels a bit like a mess. \u201cMother of shit,\u201d she curses. \u201cShit,\nshit, shit\u2014\u201d The door opens to Maria looking very much so put together, Winnie\nprobably looks like garbage, and there\u2019s the smell of coffee wafting between\nthe two of them. </p><p>\u201cUh, hello\nMaria. I tried my best to prepare lunch before you came, but there\u2019s only so\nmuch time you have before a lady comes back from putting away her groceries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cVery right,\u201d\nshe says softly with a laugh. \u201cLead the way, Winnie.\u201d </p><p>Winnie\u2019s\nhouse is decorated very nicely. Portraits of the family, those dorky old\noutfits on full display. Maria remembers the shirts that were popular at the\ntime, remembered that she owned a fair amount of them when it was around that time.\nWinnie smiles as she looks at them. </p><p>\u201cJames\u2019\nfather hates these,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I keep them around whenever he visits with\nhis wife.\u201d Maria nods. They head to the kitchen, some sunlight streaming in.\nShe has coordinating cloths, sponges, and the whole scene is perfectly\ndomestic. The black coffeemaker in the back completes it. Maria offers to help\nset the table, and Winnie lets her. They move comfortably in the kitchen as\nMaria navigates it, slowly moving around Winnie. She gets the plates and glasses,\nsetting the latter down on the counter to get water. They bump into each other,\nand Maria tries not to let Winnie see her cheeks heat up, but that\u2019s probably\nimpossible at this point. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Maria\nsays. \u201cWhat kind of coffee do we have, Win?\u201d The casual nickname shouldn\u2019t make\nWinnie smile as much as she\u2019s going to, but she gets out the selection. </p><p>\u201cWe have some\nbreakfast blend, sugar cookie, and\u2026oh god, I don\u2019t even remember getting this\none. Amaretto?\u201d Maria\u2019s eyes brighten at the last one, Winnie laughing. \u201cGuess\nwe\u2019ll go with that one. Get me some coffee cups?\u201d Maria chooses one with\nflowers all over it, the other one an old-fashioned diner cup. Winnie turns\nsuddenly, coming closer into Maria\u2019s space. </p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Maria\nexclaims. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Winnie!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\nthis is a close kitchen,\u201d she says. Also, given that Maria smelled like\nflowers and good things, being in close quarters was literally the best thing\never. </p><p>They get\ntheir coffee, sandwiches, and talk a little bit. Maria is talking about maybe starting\nworking at a bookstore\u2014the owner <i>seriously\n</i>needs some reorganization in the book department as well as some design\nwork. While Maria doesn\u2019t exactly have the best qualifications, she knows that\nshe can prove herself. Winnie encourages it. </p><p>\u201cYou always\nlook so cute, I wouldn\u2019t even question it,\u201d Winnie comments. Maria\u2019s cheeks\nturn pink as she looks down at her coffee. </p><p>\u201cAw, thanks\nWin. You look beautiful too.\u201d Winnie grins, taking another sip of her coffee.\nIt was a good idea to be friends with Maria. She just hoped she didn\u2019t muck it\nup by having actual feelings for her. </p><hr><p>Tony wasn\u2019t\nexactly the best morning person. Sure, he took coffee in the morning and\npractically gulped the whole thing down in five minutes, but that didn\u2019t mean\nmuch. He still looked like he was a walking dead man.<br></p><p>Steve knew\nthis, and still thought that Tony was one of the cutest guys he\u2019d ever met.\nSteve would grin as Tony swayed out the door, smiling dopily at Steve. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he\u2019d\nmutter, readjusting his backpack. \u201cReady to go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d Steve\nwould reply. \u201cDid you do the English assignment?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout the\u2026was\nit the Middle English?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMiddle\nAges,\u201d Steve corrected. \u201cWe were supposed to be reading more lines from <i>Beowulf.</i>\u201d Tony curses. </p><p>\u201cNo, I\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d Then Steve gives him a basic summary, Tony commits to memory, probably\ngets a better test score than he should\u2014damn that eidetic memory\u2014and all is\nwell. Their lockers are a couple away from each other, so Tony leaves Steve to\ngo put his things away. </p><p>Tony really\nthinks that having a cute neighbor that goes to the same school is just unfair.\nEspecially since Steve is a morning person, goes on a two-mile run every single\nday of his life, and is very, <i>very </i>attractive.\nTony looks roughly like a mess in the morning, which is only worsened by the\ndeath sentence that is school. Just because he can do it doesn\u2019t always mean he\nwants to. Especially this early in the morning, because who the <i>hell </i>even wants to get up early, save\nfor Steve, Bucky, and probably all of Steve\u2019s stupidly-attractive friends. Ugh,\nTony needed more people who couldn\u2019t deal with the morning. </p><p>The day goes\non, Tony making faces at Steve in the hallway, asking him how his day was\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cGoing good.\nHey, you eating with us in the cafeteria?\u201d Steve asks, shoving his math book\ninto his locker. \u201cNatasha wants to verify that you\u2019re a criminal when it comes\nto hydration.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll she has\nto do is wait a week, then see me fall in the middle of AP Chem,\u201d Tony says. </p><p>Steve rolls\nhis eyes and shoves a water bottle at Tony. \u201cDrink, because I have a bet going\nthat you\u2019ll pass out next week and I <i>really\n</i>don\u2019t want to lose five bucks to Nat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Tony\nsays, chugging the water bottle and handing it back. \u201cThanks, Stevie.\u201d </p><p>Natasha\nscowls at Tony as he sits down at the table. \u201cYou\u2019re soft, Carbonell.\u201d </p><p>\u201cComes with\ndrinking water and all that fun jazz,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWhich, by the way, I believe\nyou owe Steve five bucks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSchemer,\u201d\nNatasha mutters, sliding crumpled ones over the table. Steve takes out his\nwallet, putting them in. Tony snickers as he sees the picture of young Steve\nand his mom in a photo booth. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a\ngoofball,\u201d Tony says. \u00a0\u201cLook at that\nstupid shirt you have on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, saying\nyou haven\u2019t done a photo booth thing before, Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Tony\nsays. \u201cI was busy doing other, cooler things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, like\nsinging along to Rosemary Clooney records with your mom?\u201d Steve teases. \u201cWe can\nhear the music, and a screeching voice\u2026\u201d Tony lightly pushes Steve on the arm,\nmaking a noise of protest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nthat you don\u2019t know how amazing Rosemary is, but we have a lot of fun. Maybe\nthis means you won\u2019t be getting any orange chicken tonight.\u201d </p><p>Natasha looks\nbetween the two of them; Steve liked to say that he didn\u2019t fall easily, but\nhere he was. Staring at Tony like he hung up the stars just-so, and Tony was\nsmiling softly as he stole some of Steve\u2019s blueberries when he wasn\u2019t looking. They\nwere in love. Steve was a liar. She\u2019d have to collect on his statement of not\nfalling easily. Maybe after they got together. </p><p>The rest of\nthe day passes without incident for Tony and Steve. Natasha has a class with\nBruce, and they have a substitute teacher, which basically means they\u2019re doing\nnothing. She turns to Bruce, who sits to the right. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nnoticed Steve and Tony too, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRepeat\nthat?\u201d Bruce asks, taking an earbud out. \u201cListening to loud music.\u201d She repeats\nher statement, and he nods as soon as she finishes the sentence. \u201cOh yeah,\ndefinitely. Tony\u2019s head over heels, and always talks about what Steve is going\nto do at home with him. I think this Friday he doesn\u2019t have a football game, so\nmaybe going to the roller rink. I know Steve\u2019s skipping the party. And I think\nTony mentioned having a puzzle night on Saturday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d skip the\nparty to do a puzzle if I knew it was hosted at Rumlow\u2019s house,\u201d Natasha\nmutters. \u201cGod knows how crazy people get over there.\u201d Bruce nods. </p><p>\u201cYeah, real\nasshole guy. Tried to copy my physics work, and got caught because in Mr.\nRainey\u2019s words, \u2018you haven\u2019t been paying enough attention to do this much\ncomplex work.\u2019\u201d Natasha snorts, eyeing the clock. They got out of class in ten\nminutes. Enough time to get started on the actual bookwork, but not enough time\nto actually put any real work into it. Besides, she wants to tell Bruce about\nsome gossip she heard from the cheer squad involving one of the teachers\u2019 past.\n</p><p>Tony waits\nfor Steve to finish football practice, and walks up to him after all the guys\nexit the locker room. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your\nlover boy,\u201d Sam teases Steve. \u201cWaiting for his sweetheart to get out of\npractice, and all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw shut up,\u201d\nSteve says, shoving Sam a little bit. \u201cMakes sense to walk home together. We\nlive in the apartment complex. I think you\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t\nhave actual friends. Me and Bucky don\u2019t count, you\u2019re our charity case.\u201d Sam\nflips Steve off as he pulls out his car keys. </p><p>\u201cThat was\ncold man, straight-up cold. Think I might actually report you to Coach\nPhillips, see what he does.\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably\ncongratulate me,\u201d Steve says. \u201cFinally affected you, dumbass.\u201d Sam grins, bids\nhim goodbye, and Steve looks over to Tony with a soft smile. </p><p>\u201cHey Stevie,\u201d\nTony says. \u201cHow was practice?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSame as\nalways. We went over some plays, yelled at some of the second-strings, and\nlistened to Phillips tell us that just because Ridgemont has a shit team\ndoesn\u2019t mean we can jack around next Friday. You and your mom are still coming,\nright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSitting with\nSarah and everything,\u201d Tony says with a grin. \u201cYou still on for a puzzle\nnight?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nSteve says. \u201cI haven\u2019t done a puzzle in ages.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d\nTony says. \u201cMama picked up a new one, it looks fun. Shows a picture of vintage\ncandy tins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Steve\nresponds, adjusting his backpack. \u201cYou excited for the roller rink?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve\nnever gone to one before,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI don\u2019t even really know if I can skate.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cIf you\ncan\u2019t, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t fall,\u201d Steve teases. \u201cAfter all, you can\u2019t\ncling to the wall the whole time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy knight in\nshining armor,\u201d Tony declares, hand over his heart. \u201cWhatever do I owe you?\u201d Steve\npretends to think for a moment. </p><p>\u201cA skate\ndance when we go, I think.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was going\nto do that anyway,\u201d Tony says, rolling his eyes. \u201cCome on, I bet that Winnie or\nmom is cooking food.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngonna bet, I got a text from your mom that said she\u2019s making garlic bread.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d </p><p>The boys\narrive at Maria\u2019s apartment in a heap of backpacks and jackets and laughs.\nMaria smiles, greeting Steve with a hug and Tony with a kiss on the cheek and a\nreminder to get his laundry folded and put away. </p><p>\u201cYes, Mama!\u201d\nTony calls, slumping to the family room. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m so tired. I had to listen to\nProfessor Reed drone on and on about physics and practicality. Worst class\never.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why do\nyou take it?\u201d Steve asks, slipping in the Mario Kart disc. \u201cI say ditch it and\nfind a more interesting class.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah, I like\nhis reaction when I write my papers dissing his personal theories, it\u2019s\ntherapeutic.\u201d Steve laughs, tossing him a controller. \u201cYou prepared to have\nyour ass kicked in Mushroom Gorge?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly when\nyou admit defeat when I get first place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a\nchallenge.\u201d </p><p>They continue\nplaying, occasionally trash-talking each other. In between, Sarah comes in,\nbearing the ground beef for the spaghetti and some more dishware that she doesn\u2019t\nuse anymore that Maria likes. </p><p>\u201cReady to get\nthat waffle-maker dream out of your head?\u201d Sarah asks. </p><p>\u201cNo,\ndefinitely not,\u201d Maria replies, winking. \u201cPass me the oregano, will you? This needs\na little bit more for the meatballs.\u201d Sarah tosses her the bottle, and they work\nwith relative ease, Sarah humming along to Bob Seger on the radio. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re\nhere, our last neighbor was boring,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cReal old lady who borrowed my\ngood cheese grater and never gave it back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m\nhere, then,\u201d Maria says. \u201cCan you get the boys, it\u2019s nearly dinner time. They\nneed to wash up.\u201d </p><p>Sarah enters\nthe room to hear Steve and Tony arguing about whether or not Mario is actually\ngood. </p><p>\u201cAs\neducational as this is, I\u2019m going to have to have you guys save it for later,\u201d\nSarah says, smiling. \u201cSteve, Tony, wash up. We\u2019re having spaghetti. Tony, could\nyou cut up some fruit for us?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nTony says, giving Sarah a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYour day go okay, Ms. Rogers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nSarah answers. \u201cJust a couple of medical hiccups on paperwork at the hospital.\nI\u2019m just glad I have tomorrow off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBreak time,\u201d\nSteve comments, making his way to the bathroom. </p><p>They\u2019re all\nseated at the table, laughing together as Maria tells them about her grocery\nstore experience. They share knowing looks when she talks about her and Winnie\ngetting coffee. </p><p>\u201cYour mom has\na crush,\u201d Steve mutters to Tony. </p><p>\u201cNo duh,\u201d\nTony murmurs back, smiling and putting another bite of blueberries into his\nmouth before his mother catches him. </p>",

Why that boy can\nwake up for a shift at work but not for anything else is beyond her. Today is\nher day off, which means a lot has to happen. </p><p>Bucky\nstumbles into the kitchen, grabbing a bagel and stuffing it in the toaster.\n\u201cHey honey,\u201d Winnie says with a smile, coffee cup in one hand and the other\nwrapping around her son. \u201cHave a good night\u2019s sleep?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nBucky mutters. He shuffles over to the coffeemaker, pouring himself a cup and\nadding some creamer in. \u201cNo weird dreams last night, except that Steve was\nsecretly Leonardo da Vinci.\u201d Winnie laughs, taking a bite of her toast. </p><p>\u201cYou\nhave crazy dreams, sweetheart. What\u2019s on the agenda for today?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo\nto work, try not to die. Take Steve home from his art club so he doesn\u2019t walk\nin rainy weather.\u201d She nods, making a mental note to remind Sarah so she\ndoesn\u2019t stress out. Steve used to have a medley of maladies, yet still thought\nhe could kick God\u2019s own ass. It was a problem. Now his immune system is kicking\ninto high gear, but he still does a lot of stupid things. (Not that Winnie will\nmention it, he\u2019s like a better-behaved son, but she Knows.) </p><p>\u201cWhat about\nyou, Ma? What\u2019s your plan for today?\u201d </p><p>\u201cEh, not\nmuch,\u201d Winnie responds. \u201cGet some work emails out of the way, go grocery\nshopping with Maria. I\u2019m letting her use some of my bags.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d </p><p>That\u2019s the\nend of conversation for a bit, until Bucky glances at the clock, grabs his\nkeys, and drops a kiss on his mom\u2019s cheek. \u201cLove you, Ma. I\u2019ll see you later\ntoday, okay?\u201d Winnie waves goodbye, cleans up a bit of breakfast, and shoots\noff a text to Maria. <b>When do you want to\ngo grocery shopping? </b></p><p><i>How about 11? </i></p><p><b>Sounds great! Meet you outside your\ndoor. </b></p><p>Admittedly,\nMaria can\u2019t wait until eleven rolls around. No matter what she does, time seems\nto tick slowly on by. She cleans the kitchen floor, tidies up Tony\u2019s desk (it\u2019s\na nightmare), and also reorganizes her closet for the upcoming fall. </p>[[MORE]]<p>When it is 10:55,\nMaria gets out of the door, double-checks to make sure she has everything in\nher wallet and purse, and sees Winnie. She smiles brightly. \u201cHello Win!\u201d She\nsays. \u201cReady to go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d </p><p>As they walk,\nthey talk about everything in between. Weather, their sons, flowers, and\ngroceries. Winnie says that general brand is as good as name brand, don\u2019t let\nanything about it fool you. \u201cSome people can taste the difference, but I doubt\nTony will care,\u201d she says. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna get a cart and go.\u201d </p><p>Maria picks\nup a lot of things. She picks up a jar of blackberry preserves for breakfast,\nsome sauces, spices, fruits, and vegetables. Other basics, but that\u2019s about it.\nShe and Winnie at some products, Winnie reminisces over packing Bucky\u2019s lunch\nfor him every day with a little bag of chips, sandwich, and pudding. Maria\npicks up a box of goldfish, smiling as she remembers when Tony was young. He\nloved the fruit that Jarvis would cut up, the sticky juice running down his\nfingers. It would take him forever to be cleaned up\u2014that boy avoided baths like\nit was his personal job. </p><p>After they\nfinish up grocery shopping, Winnie offers to have Maria over for coffee and\nlunch. \u201cI just got this nice arrangement of sandwiches from a coworker and as\ngood as they are, I can\u2019t finish them myself,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cWould\nyou like to have some?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nMaria says. \u201cI\u2019m always ready to eat with you.\u201d Winnie grins, nearly blushing.\n\u201cLet me just put my groceries away, and then I\u2019ll be over to yours, if you\u2019ll\nhave me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nWinnie replies. Maria smiles, ducking into her apartment for a moment. She\u2019s\nquite glad that Winnie can\u2019t see her, because Maria is currently shoving\ngroceries wherever they can fit, and rushing to get the bags back to an orderly\nfashion for her. Tony might text her about the state of the kitchen later, but\nfor now she is going over to Winnie\u2019s house to have coffee and lunch. </p><p>The other\nwoman is currently trying to throw a cheese plate together and failing\u2014she\nforgot to get the damned Colby Jack, best of all\u2014and there\u2019s a polite knock on\nher door. Winnie feels a bit like a mess. \u201cMother of shit,\u201d she curses. \u201cShit,\nshit, shit\u2014\u201d The door opens to Maria looking very much so put together, Winnie\nprobably looks like garbage, and there\u2019s the smell of coffee wafting between\nthe two of them. </p><p>\u201cUh, hello\nMaria. I tried my best to prepare lunch before you came, but there\u2019s only so\nmuch time you have before a lady comes back from putting away her groceries.\u201d </p><p>\u201cVery right,\u201d\nshe says softly with a laugh. \u201cLead the way, Winnie.\u201d </p><p>Winnie\u2019s\nhouse is decorated very nicely. Portraits of the family, those dorky old\noutfits on full display. Maria remembers the shirts that were popular at the\ntime, remembered that she owned a fair amount of them when it was around that time.\nWinnie smiles as she looks at them. </p><p>\u201cJames\u2019\nfather hates these,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I keep them around whenever he visits with\nhis wife.\u201d Maria nods. They head to the kitchen, some sunlight streaming in.\nShe has coordinating cloths, sponges, and the whole scene is perfectly\ndomestic. The black coffeemaker in the back completes it. Maria offers to help\nset the table, and Winnie lets her. They move comfortably in the kitchen as\nMaria navigates it, slowly moving around Winnie. She gets the plates and glasses,\nsetting the latter down on the counter to get water. They bump into each other,\nand Maria tries not to let Winnie see her cheeks heat up, but that\u2019s probably\nimpossible at this point. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Maria\nsays. \u201cWhat kind of coffee do we have, Win?\u201d The casual nickname shouldn\u2019t make\nWinnie smile as much as she\u2019s going to, but she gets out the selection. </p><p>\u201cWe have some\nbreakfast blend, sugar cookie, and\u2026oh god, I don\u2019t even remember getting this\none. Amaretto?\u201d Maria\u2019s eyes brighten at the last one, Winnie laughing. \u201cGuess\nwe\u2019ll go with that one. Get me some coffee cups?\u201d Maria chooses one with\nflowers all over it, the other one an old-fashioned diner cup. Winnie turns\nsuddenly, coming closer into Maria\u2019s space. </p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Maria\nexclaims. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Winnie!\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\nthis is a close kitchen,\u201d she says. Also, given that Maria smelled like\nflowers and good things, being in close quarters was literally the best thing\never. </p><p>They get\ntheir coffee, sandwiches, and talk a little bit. Maria is talking about maybe starting\nworking at a bookstore\u2014the owner <i>seriously\n</i>needs some reorganization in the book department as well as some design\nwork. While Maria doesn\u2019t exactly have the best qualifications, she knows that\nshe can prove herself. Winnie encourages it. </p><p>\u201cYou always\nlook so cute, I wouldn\u2019t even question it,\u201d Winnie comments. Maria\u2019s cheeks\nturn pink as she looks down at her coffee. </p><p>\u201cAw, thanks\nWin. You look beautiful too.\u201d Winnie grins, taking another sip of her coffee.\nIt was a good idea to be friends with Maria. She just hoped she didn\u2019t muck it\nup by having actual feelings for her. </p><hr><p>Tony wasn\u2019t\nexactly the best morning person. Sure, he took coffee in the morning and\npractically gulped the whole thing down in five minutes, but that didn\u2019t mean\nmuch. He still looked like he was a walking dead man.<br></p><p>Steve knew\nthis, and still thought that Tony was one of the cutest guys he\u2019d ever met.\nSteve would grin as Tony swayed out the door, smiling dopily at Steve. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he\u2019d\nmutter, readjusting his backpack. \u201cReady to go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYup!\u201d Steve\nwould reply. \u201cDid you do the English assignment?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout the\u2026was\nit the Middle English?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMiddle\nAges,\u201d Steve corrected. \u201cWe were supposed to be reading more lines from <i>Beowulf.</i>\u201d Tony curses. </p><p>\u201cNo, I\ndidn\u2019t.\u201d Then Steve gives him a basic summary, Tony commits to memory, probably\ngets a better test score than he should\u2014damn that eidetic memory\u2014and all is\nwell. Their lockers are a couple away from each other, so Tony leaves Steve to\ngo put his things away. </p><p>Tony really\nthinks that having a cute neighbor that goes to the same school is just unfair.\nEspecially since Steve is a morning person, goes on a two-mile run every single\nday of his life, and is very, <i>very </i>attractive.\nTony looks roughly like a mess in the morning, which is only worsened by the\ndeath sentence that is school. Just because he can do it doesn\u2019t always mean he\nwants to. Especially this early in the morning, because who the <i>hell </i>even wants to get up early, save\nfor Steve, Bucky, and probably all of Steve\u2019s stupidly-attractive friends. Ugh,\nTony needed more people who couldn\u2019t deal with the morning. </p><p>The day goes\non, Tony making faces at Steve in the hallway, asking him how his day was\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cGoing good.\nHey, you eating with us in the cafeteria?\u201d Steve asks, shoving his math book\ninto his locker. \u201cNatasha wants to verify that you\u2019re a criminal when it comes\nto hydration.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll she has\nto do is wait a week, then see me fall in the middle of AP Chem,\u201d Tony says. </p><p>Steve rolls\nhis eyes and shoves a water bottle at Tony. \u201cDrink, because I have a bet going\nthat you\u2019ll pass out next week and I <i>really\n</i>don\u2019t want to lose five bucks to Nat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Tony\nsays, chugging the water bottle and handing it back. \u201cThanks, Stevie.\u201d </p><p>Natasha\nscowls at Tony as he sits down at the table. \u201cYou\u2019re soft, Carbonell.\u201d </p><p>\u201cComes with\ndrinking water and all that fun jazz,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWhich, by the way, I believe\nyou owe Steve five bucks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSchemer,\u201d\nNatasha mutters, sliding crumpled ones over the table. Steve takes out his\nwallet, putting them in. Tony snickers as he sees the picture of young Steve\nand his mom in a photo booth. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a\ngoofball,\u201d Tony says. \u00a0\u201cLook at that\nstupid shirt you have on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, saying\nyou haven\u2019t done a photo booth thing before, Tony?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Tony\nsays. \u201cI was busy doing other, cooler things.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat, like\nsinging along to Rosemary Clooney records with your mom?\u201d Steve teases. \u201cWe can\nhear the music, and a screeching voice\u2026\u201d Tony lightly pushes Steve on the arm,\nmaking a noise of protest. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\nthat you don\u2019t know how amazing Rosemary is, but we have a lot of fun. Maybe\nthis means you won\u2019t be getting any orange chicken tonight.\u201d </p><p>Natasha looks\nbetween the two of them; Steve liked to say that he didn\u2019t fall easily, but\nhere he was. Staring at Tony like he hung up the stars just-so, and Tony was\nsmiling softly as he stole some of Steve\u2019s blueberries when he wasn\u2019t looking. They\nwere in love. Steve was a liar. She\u2019d have to collect on his statement of not\nfalling easily. Maybe after they got together. </p><p>The rest of\nthe day passes without incident for Tony and Steve. Natasha has a class with\nBruce, and they have a substitute teacher, which basically means they\u2019re doing\nnothing. She turns to Bruce, who sits to the right. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\nnoticed Steve and Tony too, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRepeat\nthat?\u201d Bruce asks, taking an earbud out. \u201cListening to loud music.\u201d She repeats\nher statement, and he nods as soon as she finishes the sentence. \u201cOh yeah,\ndefinitely. Tony\u2019s head over heels, and always talks about what Steve is going\nto do at home with him. I think this Friday he doesn\u2019t have a football game, so\nmaybe going to the roller rink. I know Steve\u2019s skipping the party. And I think\nTony mentioned having a puzzle night on Saturday.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d skip the\nparty to do a puzzle if I knew it was hosted at Rumlow\u2019s house,\u201d Natasha\nmutters. \u201cGod knows how crazy people get over there.\u201d Bruce nods. </p><p>\u201cYeah, real\nasshole guy. Tried to copy my physics work, and got caught because in Mr.\nRainey\u2019s words, \u2018you haven\u2019t been paying enough attention to do this much\ncomplex work.\u2019\u201d Natasha snorts, eyeing the clock. They got out of class in ten\nminutes. Enough time to get started on the actual bookwork, but not enough time\nto actually put any real work into it. Besides, she wants to tell Bruce about\nsome gossip she heard from the cheer squad involving one of the teachers\u2019 past.\n</p><p>Tony waits\nfor Steve to finish football practice, and walks up to him after all the guys\nexit the locker room. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your\nlover boy,\u201d Sam teases Steve. \u201cWaiting for his sweetheart to get out of\npractice, and all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAw shut up,\u201d\nSteve says, shoving Sam a little bit. \u201cMakes sense to walk home together. We\nlive in the apartment complex. I think you\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t\nhave actual friends. Me and Bucky don\u2019t count, you\u2019re our charity case.\u201d Sam\nflips Steve off as he pulls out his car keys. </p><p>\u201cThat was\ncold man, straight-up cold. Think I might actually report you to Coach\nPhillips, see what he does.\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably\ncongratulate me,\u201d Steve says. \u201cFinally affected you, dumbass.\u201d Sam grins, bids\nhim goodbye, and Steve looks over to Tony with a soft smile. </p><p>\u201cHey Stevie,\u201d\nTony says. \u201cHow was practice?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSame as\nalways. We went over some plays, yelled at some of the second-strings, and\nlistened to Phillips tell us that just because Ridgemont has a shit team\ndoesn\u2019t mean we can jack around next Friday. You and your mom are still coming,\nright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSitting with\nSarah and everything,\u201d Tony says with a grin. \u201cYou still on for a puzzle\nnight?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nSteve says. \u201cI haven\u2019t done a puzzle in ages.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d\nTony says. \u201cMama picked up a new one, it looks fun. Shows a picture of vintage\ncandy tins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Steve\nresponds, adjusting his backpack. \u201cYou excited for the roller rink?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve\nnever gone to one before,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI don\u2019t even really know if I can skate.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cIf you\ncan\u2019t, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t fall,\u201d Steve teases. \u201cAfter all, you can\u2019t\ncling to the wall the whole time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy knight in\nshining armor,\u201d Tony declares, hand over his heart. \u201cWhatever do I owe you?\u201d Steve\npretends to think for a moment. </p><p>\u201cA skate\ndance when we go, I think.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was going\nto do that anyway,\u201d Tony says, rolling his eyes. \u201cCome on, I bet that Winnie or\nmom is cooking food.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\ngonna bet, I got a text from your mom that said she\u2019s making garlic bread.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d </p><p>The boys\narrive at Maria\u2019s apartment in a heap of backpacks and jackets and laughs.\nMaria smiles, greeting Steve with a hug and Tony with a kiss on the cheek and a\nreminder to get his laundry folded and put away. </p><p>\u201cYes, Mama!\u201d\nTony calls, slumping to the family room. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m so tired. I had to listen to\nProfessor Reed drone on and on about physics and practicality. Worst class\never.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen why do\nyou take it?\u201d Steve asks, slipping in the Mario Kart disc. \u201cI say ditch it and\nfind a more interesting class.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah, I like\nhis reaction when I write my papers dissing his personal theories, it\u2019s\ntherapeutic.\u201d Steve laughs, tossing him a controller. \u201cYou prepared to have\nyour ass kicked in Mushroom Gorge?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly when\nyou admit defeat when I get first place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a\nchallenge.\u201d </p><p>They continue\nplaying, occasionally trash-talking each other. In between, Sarah comes in,\nbearing the ground beef for the spaghetti and some more dishware that she doesn\u2019t\nuse anymore that Maria likes. </p><p>\u201cReady to get\nthat waffle-maker dream out of your head?\u201d Sarah asks. </p><p>\u201cNo,\ndefinitely not,\u201d Maria replies, winking. \u201cPass me the oregano, will you? This needs\na little bit more for the meatballs.\u201d Sarah tosses her the bottle, and they work\nwith relative ease, Sarah humming along to Bob Seger on the radio. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re\nhere, our last neighbor was boring,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cReal old lady who borrowed my\ngood cheese grater and never gave it back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m\nhere, then,\u201d Maria says. \u201cCan you get the boys, it\u2019s nearly dinner time. They\nneed to wash up.\u201d </p><p>Sarah enters\nthe room to hear Steve and Tony arguing about whether or not Mario is actually\ngood. </p><p>\u201cAs\neducational as this is, I\u2019m going to have to have you guys save it for later,\u201d\nSarah says, smiling. \u201cSteve, Tony, wash up. We\u2019re having spaghetti. Tony, could\nyou cut up some fruit for us?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d\nTony says, giving Sarah a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYour day go okay, Ms. Rogers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d\nSarah answers. \u201cJust a couple of medical hiccups on paperwork at the hospital.\nI\u2019m just glad I have tomorrow off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBreak time,\u201d\nSteve comments, making his way to the bathroom. </p><p>They\u2019re all\nseated at the table, laughing together as Maria tells them about her grocery\nstore experience. They share knowing looks when she talks about her and Winnie\ngetting coffee. </p><p>\u201cYour mom has\na crush,\u201d Steve mutters to Tony. </p><p>\u201cNo duh,\u201d\nTony murmurs back, smiling and putting another bite of blueberries into his\nmouth before his mother catches him. </p>",
                "content": "<p>y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t think i would did you&nbsp;</p><p>Winnie\nwakes up around seven, groaning as Bucky&rsquo;s alarm goes off. Why that boy can\nwake up for a shift at work but not for anything else is beyond her. Today is\nher day off, which means a lot has to happen. </p><p>Bucky\nstumbles into the kitchen, grabbing a bagel and stuffing it in the toaster.\n&ldquo;Hey honey,&rdquo; Winnie says with a smile, coffee cup in one hand and the other\nwrapping around her son. &ldquo;Have a good night&rsquo;s sleep?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nBucky mutters. He shuffles over to the coffeemaker, pouring himself a cup and\nadding some creamer in. &ldquo;No weird dreams last night, except that Steve was\nsecretly Leonardo da Vinci.&rdquo; Winnie laughs, taking a bite of her toast. </p><p>&ldquo;You\nhave crazy dreams, sweetheart. What&rsquo;s on the agenda for today?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go\nto work, try not to die. Take Steve home from his art club so he doesn&rsquo;t walk\nin rainy weather.&rdquo; She nods, making a mental note to remind Sarah so she\ndoesn&rsquo;t stress out. Steve used to have a medley of maladies, yet still thought\nhe could kick God&rsquo;s own ass. It was a problem. Now his immune system is kicking\ninto high gear, but he still does a lot of stupid things. (Not that Winnie will\nmention it, he&rsquo;s like a better-behaved son, but she Knows.) </p><p>&ldquo;What about\nyou, Ma? What&rsquo;s your plan for today?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Eh, not\nmuch,&rdquo; Winnie responds. &ldquo;Get some work emails out of the way, go grocery\nshopping with Maria. I&rsquo;m letting her use some of my bags.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; </p><p>That&rsquo;s the\nend of conversation for a bit, until Bucky glances at the clock, grabs his\nkeys, and drops a kiss on his mom&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Love you, Ma. I&rsquo;ll see you later\ntoday, okay?&rdquo; Winnie waves goodbye, cleans up a bit of breakfast, and shoots\noff a text to Maria. <b>When do you want to\ngo grocery shopping? </b></p><p><i>How about 11? </i></p><p><b>Sounds great! Meet you outside your\ndoor. </b></p><p>Admittedly,\nMaria can&rsquo;t wait until eleven rolls around. No matter what she does, time seems\nto tick slowly on by. She cleans the kitchen floor, tidies up Tony&rsquo;s desk (it&rsquo;s\na nightmare), and also reorganizes her closet for the upcoming fall. </p><p>When it is 10:55,\nMaria gets out of the door, double-checks to make sure she has everything in\nher wallet and purse, and sees Winnie. She smiles brightly. &ldquo;Hello Win!&rdquo; She\nsays. &ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; </p><p>As they walk,\nthey talk about everything in between. Weather, their sons, flowers, and\ngroceries. Winnie says that general brand is as good as name brand, don&rsquo;t let\nanything about it fool you. &ldquo;Some people can taste the difference, but I doubt\nTony will care,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna get a cart and go.&rdquo; </p><p>Maria picks\nup a lot of things. She picks up a jar of blackberry preserves for breakfast,\nsome sauces, spices, fruits, and vegetables. Other basics, but that&rsquo;s about it.\nShe and Winnie at some products, Winnie reminisces over packing Bucky&rsquo;s lunch\nfor him every day with a little bag of chips, sandwich, and pudding.

He still looked like he was a walking dead man.<br /></p><p>Steve knew\nthis, and still thought that Tony was one of the cutest guys he&rsquo;d ever met.\nSteve would grin as Tony swayed out the door, smiling dopily at Steve. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d\nmutter, readjusting his backpack. &ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yup!&rdquo; Steve\nwould reply. &ldquo;Did you do the English assignment?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;About the&hellip;was\nit the Middle English?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Middle\nAges,&rdquo; Steve corrected. &ldquo;We were supposed to be reading more lines from <i>Beowulf.</i>&rdquo; Tony curses. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I\ndidn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then Steve gives him a basic summary, Tony commits to memory, probably\ngets a better test score than he should&mdash;damn that eidetic memory&mdash;and all is\nwell. Their lockers are a couple away from each other, so Tony leaves Steve to\ngo put his things away. </p><p>Tony really\nthinks that having a cute neighbor that goes to the same school is just unfair.\nEspecially since Steve is a morning person, goes on a two-mile run every single\nday of his life, and is very, <i>very </i>attractive.\nTony looks roughly like a mess in the morning, which is only worsened by the\ndeath sentence that is school. Just because he can do it doesn&rsquo;t always mean he\nwants to. Especially this early in the morning, because who the <i>hell </i>even wants to get up early, save\nfor Steve, Bucky, and probably all of Steve&rsquo;s stupidly-attractive friends. Ugh,\nTony needed more people who couldn&rsquo;t deal with the morning. </p><p>The day goes\non, Tony making faces at Steve in the hallway, asking him how his day was\ngoing. </p><p>&ldquo;Going good.\nHey, you eating with us in the cafeteria?&rdquo; Steve asks, shoving his math book\ninto his locker. &ldquo;Natasha wants to verify that you&rsquo;re a criminal when it comes\nto hydration.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;All she has\nto do is wait a week, then see me fall in the middle of AP Chem,&rdquo; Tony says. </p><p>Steve rolls\nhis eyes and shoves a water bottle at Tony. &ldquo;Drink, because I have a bet going\nthat you&rsquo;ll pass out next week and I <i>really\n</i>don&rsquo;t want to lose five bucks to Nat.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; Tony\nsays, chugging the water bottle and handing it back. &ldquo;Thanks, Stevie.&rdquo; </p><p>Natasha\nscowls at Tony as he sits down at the table. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re soft, Carbonell.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Comes with\ndrinking water and all that fun jazz,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;Which, by the way, I believe\nyou owe Steve five bucks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Schemer,&rdquo;\nNatasha mutters, sliding crumpled ones over the table. Steve takes out his\nwallet, putting them in. Tony snickers as he sees the picture of young Steve\nand his mom in a photo booth. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a\ngoofball,&rdquo; Tony says. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look at that\nstupid shirt you have on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What, saying\nyou haven&rsquo;t done a photo booth thing before, Tony?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Tony\nsays. &ldquo;I was busy doing other, cooler things.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What, like\nsinging along to Rosemary Clooney records with your mom?&rdquo; Steve teases. &ldquo;We can\nhear the music, and a screeching voice&hellip;&rdquo; Tony lightly pushes Steve on the arm,\nmaking a noise of protest. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry\nthat you don&rsquo;t know how amazing Rosemary is, but we have a lot of fun. Maybe\nthis means you won&rsquo;t be getting any orange chicken tonight.&rdquo; </p><p>Natasha looks\nbetween the two of them; Steve liked to say that he didn&rsquo;t fall easily, but\nhere he was. Staring at Tony like he hung up the stars just-so, and Tony was\nsmiling softly as he stole some of Steve&rsquo;s blueberries when he wasn&rsquo;t looking. They\nwere in love. Steve was a liar. She&rsquo;d have to collect on his statement of not\nfalling easily. Maybe after they got together. </p><p>The rest of\nthe day passes without incident for Tony and Steve. Natasha has a class with\nBruce, and they have a substitute teacher, which basically means they&rsquo;re doing\nnothing. She turns to Bruce, who sits to the right. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\nnoticed Steve and Tony too, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Repeat\nthat?&rdquo; Bruce asks, taking an earbud out. &ldquo;Listening to loud music.&rdquo; She repeats\nher statement, and he nods as soon as she finishes the sentence. &ldquo;Oh yeah,\ndefinitely. Tony&rsquo;s head over heels, and always talks about what Steve is going\nto do at home with him. I think this Friday he doesn&rsquo;t have a football game, so\nmaybe going to the roller rink. I know Steve&rsquo;s skipping the party. And I think\nTony mentioned having a puzzle night on Saturday.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d skip the\nparty to do a puzzle if I knew it was hosted at Rumlow&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Natasha\nmutters. &ldquo;God knows how crazy people get over there.&rdquo; Bruce nods. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, real\nasshole guy. Tried to copy my physics work, and got caught because in Mr.\nRainey&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;you haven&rsquo;t been paying enough attention to do this much\ncomplex work.&rsquo;&rdquo; Natasha snorts, eyeing the clock. They got out of class in ten\nminutes. Enough time to get started on the actual bookwork, but not enough time\nto actually put any real work into it. Besides, she wants to tell Bruce about\nsome gossip she heard from the cheer squad involving one of the teachers&rsquo; past.\n</p><p>Tony waits\nfor Steve to finish football practice, and walks up to him after all the guys\nexit the locker room. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your\nlover boy,&rdquo; Sam teases Steve. &ldquo;Waiting for his sweetheart to get out of\npractice, and all.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aw shut up,&rdquo;\nSteve says, shoving Sam a little bit. &ldquo;Makes sense to walk home together. We\nlive in the apartment complex. I think you&rsquo;re just jealous because you don&rsquo;t\nhave actual friends. Me and Bucky don&rsquo;t count, you&rsquo;re our charity case.&rdquo; Sam\nflips Steve off as he pulls out his car keys. </p><p>&ldquo;That was\ncold man, straight-up cold. Think I might actually report you to Coach\nPhillips, see what he does.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Probably\ncongratulate me,&rdquo; Steve says. &ldquo;Finally affected you, dumbass.&rdquo; Sam grins, bids\nhim goodbye, and Steve looks over to Tony with a soft smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Stevie,&rdquo;\nTony says. &ldquo;How was practice?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Same as\nalways. We went over some plays, yelled at some of the second-strings, and\nlistened to Phillips tell us that just because Ridgemont has a shit team\ndoesn&rsquo;t mean we can jack around next Friday. You and your mom are still coming,\nright?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sitting with\nSarah and everything,&rdquo; Tony says with a grin. &ldquo;You still on for a puzzle\nnight?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;\nSteve says. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done a puzzle in ages.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo;\nTony says. &ldquo;Mama picked up a new one, it looks fun. Shows a picture of vintage\ncandy tins.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nice,&rdquo; Steve\nresponds, adjusting his backpack. &ldquo;You excited for the roller rink?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve\nnever gone to one before,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even really know if I can skate.&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;If you\ncan&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll make sure you don&rsquo;t fall,&rdquo; Steve teases. &ldquo;After all, you can&rsquo;t\ncling to the wall the whole time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My knight in\nshining armor,&rdquo; Tony declares, hand over his heart. &ldquo;Whatever do I owe you?&rdquo; Steve\npretends to think for a moment. </p><p>&ldquo;A skate\ndance when we go, I think.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was going\nto do that anyway,&rdquo; Tony says, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Come on, I bet that Winnie or\nmom is cooking food.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not\ngonna bet, I got a text from your mom that said she&rsquo;s making garlic bread.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; </p><p>The boys\narrive at Maria&rsquo;s apartment in a heap of backpacks and jackets and laughs.\nMaria smiles, greeting Steve with a hug and Tony with a kiss on the cheek and a\nreminder to get his laundry folded and put away. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mama!&rdquo;\nTony calls, slumping to the family room. &ldquo;Ugh, I&rsquo;m so tired. I had to listen to\nProfessor Reed drone on and on about physics and practicality. Worst class\never.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then why do\nyou take it?&rdquo; Steve asks, slipping in the Mario Kart disc. &ldquo;I say ditch it and\nfind a more interesting class.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nah, I like\nhis reaction when I write my papers dissing his personal theories, it&rsquo;s\ntherapeutic.&rdquo; Steve laughs, tossing him a controller. &ldquo;You prepared to have\nyour ass kicked in Mushroom Gorge?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Only when\nyou admit defeat when I get first place.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a\nchallenge.&rdquo; </p><p>They continue\nplaying, occasionally trash-talking each other. In between, Sarah comes in,\nbearing the ground beef for the spaghetti and some more dishware that she doesn&rsquo;t\nuse anymore that Maria likes. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready to get\nthat waffle-maker dream out of your head?&rdquo; Sarah asks. </p><p>&ldquo;No,\ndefinitely not,&rdquo; Maria replies, winking. &ldquo;Pass me the oregano, will you? This needs\na little bit more for the meatballs.&rdquo; Sarah tosses her the bottle, and they work\nwith relative ease, Sarah humming along to Bob Seger on the radio. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re\nhere, our last neighbor was boring,&rdquo; Sarah says. &ldquo;Real old lady who borrowed my\ngood cheese grater and never gave it back.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m\nhere, then,&rdquo; Maria says. &ldquo;Can you get the boys, it&rsquo;s nearly dinner time. They\nneed to wash up.&rdquo; </p><p>Sarah enters\nthe room to hear Steve and Tony arguing about whether or not Mario is actually\ngood. </p><p>&ldquo;As\neducational as this is, I&rsquo;m going to have to have you guys save it for later,&rdquo;\nSarah says, smiling. &ldquo;Steve, Tony, wash up. We&rsquo;re having spaghetti. Tony, could\nyou cut up some fruit for us?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo;\nTony says, giving Sarah a kiss on the cheek. &ldquo;Your day go okay, Ms. Rogers?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;\nSarah answers. &ldquo;Just a couple of medical hiccups on paperwork at the hospital.\nI&rsquo;m just glad I have tomorrow off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Break time,&rdquo;\nSteve comments, making his way to the bathroom. </p><p>They&rsquo;re all\nseated at the table, laughing together as Maria tells them about her grocery\nstore experience. They share knowing looks when she talks about her and Winnie\ngetting coffee. </p><p>&ldquo;Your mom has\na crush,&rdquo; Steve mutters to Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;No duh,&rdquo;\nTony murmurs back, smiling and putting another bite of blueberries into his\nmouth before his mother catches him. </p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>y&rsquo;all didn&rsquo;t think i would did you&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Winnie\nwakes up around seven, groaning as Bucky&rsquo;s alarm goes off. Why that boy can\nwake up for a shift at work but not for anything else is beyond her. Today is\nher day off, which means a lot has to happen. </p>\n<p>Bucky\nstumbles into the kitchen, grabbing a bagel and stuffing it in the toaster.\n&ldquo;Hey honey,&rdquo; Winnie says with a smile, coffee cup in one hand and the other\nwrapping around her son. &ldquo;Have a good night&rsquo;s sleep?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;\nBucky mutters. He shuffles over to the coffeemaker, pouring himself a cup and\nadding some creamer in. &ldquo;No weird dreams last night, except that Steve was\nsecretly Leonardo da Vinci.&rdquo; Winnie laughs, taking a bite of her toast. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You\nhave crazy dreams, sweetheart. What&rsquo;s on the agenda for today?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Go\nto work, try not to die. Take Steve home from his art club so he doesn&rsquo;t walk\nin rainy weather.&rdquo; She nods, making a mental note to remind Sarah so she\ndoesn&rsquo;t stress out. Steve used to have a medley of maladies, yet still thought\nhe could kick God&rsquo;s own ass. It was a problem. Now his immune system is kicking\ninto high gear, but he still does a lot of stupid things. (Not that Winnie will\nmention it, he&rsquo;s like a better-behaved son, but she Knows.) </p>\n<p>&ldquo;What about\nyou, Ma? What&rsquo;s your plan for today?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Eh, not\nmuch,&rdquo; Winnie responds. &ldquo;Get some work emails out of the way, go grocery\nshopping with Maria. I&rsquo;m letting her use some of my bags.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the\nend of conversation for a bit, until Bucky glances at the clock, grabs his\nkeys, and drops a kiss on his mom&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;Love you, Ma. I&rsquo;ll see you later\ntoday, okay?&rdquo; Winnie waves goodbye, cleans up a bit of breakfast, and shoots\noff a text to Maria. <b>When do you want to\ngo grocery shopping? </b></p>\n<p><i>How about 11? </i></p>\n<p><b>Sounds great! Meet you outside your\ndoor. </b></p>\n<p>Admittedly,\nMaria can&rsquo;t wait until eleven rolls around. No matter what she does, time seems\nto tick slowly on by. She cleans the kitchen floor, tidies up Tony&rsquo;s desk (it&rsquo;s\na nightmare), and also reorganizes her closet for the upcoming fall. </p>\n</p>",

Where was he? He was&hellip; in a bed? In someone\u2019s house? Where was he last? Someone was tapping his back real gently. It tickled enough to wake him up. He giggled lightly. \u201cNoho more!\u201d He pleaded sleepily. The poking stopped but then he heard a voice. </p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d It was a man. Peter day up and turned his head to look at this mystery person. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d He asked in a panic. He tried to get out of the bed but the person pushed his shoulders back down and straddled him, keeping him in place. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask again. Who are you?\u201d The man demanded. Peter struggled in the guys hold but then he answered. \u201cPeter. Peter Parker. Who are you? How did I get here?\u201d He asked frantically. </p><p>\u201cMy name is Bucky Barnes. I don\u2019t know how you got here. What\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d He asked calmly. </p><p>\u201cI was&hellip; that\u2019s none of your business.\u201d He said. \u201cWell it kind of is because you\u2019re in Stark headquarters and I have absolutely no idea who the fuck you are!\u201d </p><p>Peter huffed. \u201cI said my name was Peter.\u201d Bucky rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat were you doing before you got here?\u201d He asked. Peter kept his lips sealed. \u201cI can make you talk. Don\u2019t test me.\u201d Bucky warned. Peter stayed silent and glared at the man above him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I ignored that giggle you let out when I woke you up.\u201d He said as he poked the kids side. Peter jumped but made no noise. \u201cI do the same thing to wake Steve up. I poke at this one spot on his back because it tickled him awake.\u201d He explained as he lazily traced his fingers along Peter\u2019s waist. </p><p>Which is also when Peter noticed that he was still wearing his suit but his mask was no where to be seen. Add that to the list of people who knew his identity. </p><p>But that\u2019s not the focus right now. In fact, Peter couldn\u2019t even think about that for long before his thoughts were filled with \u2018someone is ticking you.\u2019 He tried to squirm but Bucky was straddling his hips and he had one hand pushing down at his shoulder. Peter started to grab at the hand that was holding him down but it wouldn\u2019t budge. It was made of&hellip; metal? </p><p>Bucky took this opportunity to sneak his hand up into Peters underarm. Peter squealed and pressed his arm into his side. Bucky slipped his fingers out and started to claw at Peter\u2019s belly. </p><p>Peter let out an embarrassing yelp and covered his mouth with one hand while the other remained at his side. </p><p>Bucky chuckled and circled his fingers around Peter\u2019s bellybutton. Peter was laughing loudly and his head was thrown back. Bucky poked a finger into his belly button for a second and then squeezed his sides. Peter practically screamed and he squeezed his eyes shut. The quick changes of tickling were too much for his small body to handle. He was twitching and jumping with every new touch the solider did on his torso. </p><p>\u201cReady to talk? I just want to know what you were doing before you were here.\u201d Bucky said. He noticed that Peter was laughing so hard that he was struggling to talk. He decided to take a lighter approach. He let go of Peter\u2019s shoulder and brought both of his hands up to Peter\u2019s neck. Peter tried to scrunch his shoulders up but to no avail. He wasn\u2019t blocking this. </p><p>\u201cNow answer me.\u201d Bucky demanded. Peter squealed and scrunched his nose up. \u201cI wahas fihihighting!\u201d He giggled out. His face turned even more pink than it had been before. Bucky scratched behind his ear with one hand and the back of his neck with the other. \u201cTohohony Stark!\u201d He said. This confused Bucky. He fought Tony and Tony let him sleep in the headquarters? Unbelievable. </p><p>\u201cDid you hurt him?\u201d Bucky asked as he used both hands to tickle the top of his spine. Peter giggled but didn\u2019t answer. Damn. There was one place left. Bucky climbed off of the kid and flipped him over. Peter was too busy trying to rid of the ghost giggles to try and escape. Bucky sat on his ankles, facing his feet. He wanted to be rough enough to threaten the boy but also not over so it so that he can\u2019t talk. </p><p>Bucky lightly scratched at the center of his soles. \u201cDid you hurt Tony?\u201d He asked again. If the answer was no, he\u2019d let him go. If it was yes, he might have to tickle him till he cries. </p><p>Peter yelped and buried his face into the pillow below him. He laughed into it. Bucky realized that he wasn\u2019t going to get it out of him that easily so he decided to be a bit meaner. He quickly spidered his fingers up and down the lengths of his feet. Alternating directions. Peter screamed into the pillow. Bucky laughed to himself before he started to apply more pressure to his touch. Keeping the same rhythm. Peter\u2019s whole body shook and shuddered as he cackled into the sqishy pillow. Bucky gave some well deserved attention to his toes. He pinched and teased the skin under them. He switched between slow, torturous strokes and fast, unbearable scribbles. </p><p>Peter finally had enough. </p><p>\u201cIHIHIL TAHAHALK!\u201d He said and shortly after, he snorted. Bucky slowed his attack and kept a light scratch on his heels. \u201cThen talk.\u201d Bucky said. </p><p>Peter panted for a few seconds before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t know! All I know is that Tony tickled me half to death and I woke up here.\u201d </p><p>Bucky thought for a second but the stopped his attack. He climbed up to where the kid was laying. \u201cSorry about that. Heh, tickling is a common thing here. It\u2019s like our own little way of bonding and showing each other that we feel like a family.\u201d Bucky said as he rubbed Peter\u2019s back. Peter flipped over so that he was facing up. </p><p>\u201cDoes that mean Tony thinks of me as&hellip; a son?\u201d He asked. Bucky laughed and then nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s talked about you. He sees some really great potential in you.\u201d </p><p>This made Peter smile. But his smile soon faded as he drifted off into sleep. Bucky tucked him into the covers and crawled in with him. He held the boy close and fell asleep. </p><p>\u201cHey, Buck. Can I talk-\u201c Tony walked into the room but cut himself off. Bucky\u2019s arm was wrapped around Peter and Peter had a ghost of a smile on his face. </p><p>He could tell that Peter was one of them. </p>",

If the answer was no, he\u2019d let him go. If it was yes, he might have to tickle him till he cries. </p><p>Peter yelped and buried his face into the pillow below him. He laughed into it. Bucky realized that he wasn\u2019t going to get it out of him that easily so he decided to be a bit meaner. He quickly spidered his fingers up and down the lengths of his feet. Alternating directions. Peter screamed into the pillow. Bucky laughed to himself before he started to apply more pressure to his touch. Keeping the same rhythm. Peter\u2019s whole body shook and shuddered as he cackled into the sqishy pillow. Bucky gave some well deserved attention to his toes. He pinched and teased the skin under them. He switched between slow, torturous strokes and fast, unbearable scribbles. </p><p>Peter finally had enough. </p><p>\u201cIHIHIL TAHAHALK!\u201d He said and shortly after, he snorted. Bucky slowed his attack and kept a light scratch on his heels. \u201cThen talk.\u201d Bucky said. </p><p>Peter panted for a few seconds before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t know! All I know is that Tony tickled me half to death and I woke up here.\u201d </p><p>Bucky thought for a second but the stopped his attack. He climbed up to where the kid was laying. \u201cSorry about that. Heh, tickling is a common thing here. It\u2019s like our own little way of bonding and showing each other that we feel like a family.\u201d Bucky said as he rubbed Peter\u2019s back. Peter flipped over so that he was facing up. </p><p>\u201cDoes that mean Tony thinks of me as\u2026 a son?\u201d He asked. Bucky laughed and then nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s talked about you. He sees some really great potential in you.\u201d </p><p>This made Peter smile. But his smile soon faded as he drifted off into sleep. Bucky tucked him into the covers and crawled in with him. He held the boy close and fell asleep. </p><p>\u201cHey, Buck. Can I talk-\u201c Tony walked into the room but cut himself off. Bucky\u2019s arm was wrapped around Peter and Peter had a ghost of a smile on his face. </p><p>He could tell that Peter was one of them. </p>",

Where was he? He was\u2026 in a bed? In someone\u2019s house? Where was he last? Someone was tapping his back real gently. It tickled enough to wake him up. He giggled lightly. \u201cNoho more!\u201d He pleaded sleepily. The poking stopped but then he heard a voice. </p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d It was a man. Peter day up and turned his head to look at this mystery person. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d He asked in a panic. He tried to get out of the bed but the person pushed his shoulders back down and straddled him, keeping him in place. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask again. Who are you?\u201d The man demanded. Peter struggled in the guys hold but then he answered. \u201cPeter. Peter Parker. Who are you? How did I get here?\u201d He asked frantically. </p><p>\u201cMy name is Bucky Barnes. I don\u2019t know how you got here. What\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d He asked calmly. </p><p>\u201cI was\u2026 that\u2019s none of your business.\u201d He said. \u201cWell it kind of is because you\u2019re in Stark headquarters and I have absolutely no idea who the fuck you are!\u201d </p><p>Peter huffed. \u201cI said my name was Peter.\u201d Bucky rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat were you doing before you got here?\u201d He asked. Peter kept his lips sealed. \u201cI can make you talk. Don\u2019t test me.\u201d Bucky warned. Peter stayed silent and glared at the man above him. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I ignored that giggle you let out when I woke you up.\u201d He said as he poked the kids side. Peter jumped but made no noise. \u201cI do the same thing to wake Steve up. I poke at this one spot on his back because it tickled him awake.\u201d He explained as he lazily traced his fingers along Peter\u2019s waist. </p><p>Which is also when Peter noticed that he was still wearing his suit but his mask was no where to be seen. Add that to the list of people who knew his identity. </p><p>But that\u2019s not the focus right now. In fact, Peter couldn\u2019t even think about that for long before his thoughts were filled with \u2018someone is ticking you.\u2019 He tried to squirm but Bucky was straddling his hips and he had one hand pushing down at his shoulder. Peter started to grab at the hand that was holding him down but it wouldn\u2019t budge. It was made of\u2026 metal? </p><p>Bucky took this opportunity to sneak his hand up into Peters underarm. Peter squealed and pressed his arm into his side. Bucky slipped his fingers out and started to claw at Peter\u2019s belly. </p><p>Peter let out an embarrassing yelp and covered his mouth with one hand while the other remained at his side. </p><p>Bucky chuckled and circled his fingers around Peter\u2019s bellybutton. Peter was laughing loudly and his head was thrown back. Bucky poked a finger into his belly button for a second and then squeezed his sides. Peter practically screamed and he squeezed his eyes shut. The quick changes of tickling were too much for his small body to handle. He was twitching and jumping with every new touch the solider did on his torso. </p><p>\u201cReady to talk? I just want to know what you were doing before you were here.\u201d Bucky said. He noticed that Peter was laughing so hard that he was struggling to talk. He decided to take a lighter approach. He let go of Peter\u2019s shoulder and brought both of his hands up to Peter\u2019s neck. Peter tried to scrunch his shoulders up but to no avail. He wasn\u2019t blocking this. </p><p>\u201cNow answer me.\u201d Bucky demanded. Peter squealed and scrunched his nose up. \u201cI wahas fihihighting!\u201d He giggled out. His face turned even more pink than it had been before. Bucky scratched behind his ear with one hand and the back of his neck with the other. \u201cTohohony Stark!\u201d He said. This confused Bucky. He fought Tony and Tony let him sleep in the headquarters? Unbelievable. </p><p>\u201cDid you hurt him?\u201d Bucky asked as he used both hands to tickle the top of his spine. Peter giggled but didn\u2019t answer. Damn. There was one place left. Bucky climbed off of the kid and flipped him over. Peter was too busy trying to rid of the ghost giggles to try and escape. Bucky sat on his ankles, facing his feet. He wanted to be rough enough to threaten the boy but also not over so it so that he can\u2019t talk. </p><p>Bucky lightly scratched at the center of his soles. \u201cDid you hurt Tony?\u201d He asked again.
