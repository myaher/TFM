Secrecy! And a whole lot of internal screaming. Starring Daniel\nHowell. One of the greatest mysteries of our generation. What is Dan\u2019s\nsexuality?\u00bb</p><p>Spoiler alert. I\u2019m not straight. Sex, the foundation of life and the\nonly thing we\u2019re really supposed to do. Everyone\u2019s obsessed with it. You bunch\nof degenerates. In the list of things that identify a person, one of the most\nimportant for other people to know is their sexuality. For, if sex is the\nprimal force propelling all of these humans forward by their hips, they have to\nknow. Are we gonna fuck? Or like could we? Or are you, \u2018cause I\u2019m just\nwondering. Now, we live in a heteronormative world, which is a long scary word\nthat makes people feel attacked for some reason. Shh it\u2019s okay.\n<!-- more -->\n</p><p>What it means is people are presumed to be straight. If you\u2019re not, then\nat some point, you have to \u201ccome out\u201d, which is a whole thing. Or people might\njust try and guess based on something you do or the way you act, because yay\nstereotypes. So this is something you have to be clear on, because if you\u2019re\nnot, how are all these other people that aren\u2019t you going to cope? But I\u2019m\npretty sure no one that knows me thinks I\u2019m straight. So I don\u2019t really need to\ncome out as much as just clarify what the hell is going on. As here I am at age\n27 and my sexual preference is seemingly still a vague, debatable, confusing,\nimpenetrable mystery. But why? And what is it? Well, those are some big\nquestions. Are you sure you wanna know my answers?</p><p>[YES]</p><p>Okay, well, if you say so &lsquo;cause this is a complicated and sensitive\nissue and when it comes to me, boy, there is a lot to unpack here and it is a\ntotal clusterfuck. So strap yourselves in and let me tell you a queer little\nstory about a boy named Dan.</p><p>Chapter 1 \u2013 The Word</p><p>\u266a When I was a young boy \u266a</p><p>\u266a My father \u266a</p><p>Didn\u2019t have much time for me because my conception was clearly an\naccident and he was a narcissistic proud man suddenly inconvenienced in the\nprime of his life and this emotional neglect gave me lasting problems. </p><p>Sorry that\u2019s not all relevant right now.</p><p>I was an only child for seven years and with working parents. This meant\nI had to make my own fun so I was imaginative \u00a0and loud which is something that my teachers used\nto say quite a lot followed by, \u201cHowever.\u201d Here I am age five. Look\nat me. Cute, poised, sassy, turning out this photo shoot like sorry, Grandma, I\nstunted on this set. Are you seeing this? In almost every way, I literally\npeaked age five. I loved being the center of attention. People said I had an\ninfectious happiness, that my beaming smile brought them hope and joy. People\nthat know me are laughing right now. But a boy, in the '90s being happy and\ngenerally polite acting? Sounds kinda GAY if you ask me. Literally, masculinity\nwas so fragile, people were so proud and scared and society so aggressive that\na boy smiling!?.. appearing to be empathetic or in any way emoting was seen as\na threat. How dare they laugh and feel comfortable? They must be soft and weak\nand girly and GAY. So basically thanks, Grandma, for raising me to be a nice\nchild, you dick. Just kidding. That\u2019s a joke and I told you not to watch this\nvideo because it would be rude so if you send me a disappointed text telling me\nyou\u2019re offended, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Although, now I think about it,\nyou did make me go to church for 10 years, which in hindsight probably also\ndidn\u2019t help \u266a Hallelujah \u266a the issue here so. But then it was time for little\nDan to go to school and this is when it \u00a0</p><p> \u266a All went wrong \u266a</p><p>'Cause it turns out most children, evil pieces of shit. Doesn\u2019t matter\nif you try to raise a happy innocent child, throw that kid into school, aka, a\nliteral Mad Max Battle Royale with the feral offspring of your local community.\nYeah, that crap\u2019ll be undone in about two weeks. I was six years old running\naround the playground pretending to be Sonic the Hedgehog or something when two\nbrothers come up to me aged seven and eight with an unexplained aggressive look\nin their eye. And the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach,\nand just says, \u201cGAY.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time I ever heard that word. Well, I don\u2019t know what\nthe heck gay means but apparently it means people kick you on the floor so that\nain\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t know this child or give them any cause to have an opinion\non me. And, actually, I never directly interacted with them again. What epic clustershit\nof failed parenting and general culture brought this tiny child to get angry and\nattack someone, then call them gay for looking like they were having fun\noutside. Are you okay, 1990s? And so my relationship with sexuality began. </p><p>I wasn\u2019t looking to define myself as a child indiscriminately playing\ndoctors and nurses with various friends until once somebody\u2019s mum walked into a\nroom to find three fully naked children sat on a bed sticking sellotape to each\nother\u2019s butts. Yep, which I don\u2019t recommend. Also, Jesus Christ, the poor woman\nthat saw that. Then you get to the magic age around 10 or 11 where everybody\nsuddenly wants to pretend they\u2019re totally a \u201ccool teenager\u201d who\u2019s doing all the\ndrugs and the sex and the fights, totally. Boy, gay was a really popular word\nback then. </p><p> [[Boy] Uh, homework is gay. [Girl]\nUh, my mum\u2019s so gay. [Boy] Uh, you touched a girl, gay.]</p><p>This one little shit who I won\u2019t name was one of the school bullies and\nhe loved the word gay. He had it in for me and I have no idea why. You know me,\nMr. Winnie the Pooh Meets Slender Man. Well, when I was 10 just Winnie the\nPooh. I didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 to no one ever and yet this guy used my pacifism as a\npunching bag where any group situation was an excuse to single me out call me\ngay for some reason and then make everyone else exclude me because they were\nscared of him. I had a girlfriend. We dated for six whole weeks. We kissed in a\ngame of spin the bottle once by literally sucking on each other\u2019s faces. Then\nshe ended dumping me over speakerphone at a birthday party that everyone in my\nclass but me was invited to but, hey. I don\u2019t know what I was doing wrong, but\nat this age, I understood one thing. Being gay, whatever that meant, was clearly\nthe worst thing you could be. On a Darwinian level, I was being told, okay\nbitch, \u201cSurvival Code\u201d. Don\u2019t be this apparently. Evolution. Plot\ntwist, this bully I think he was a bit gay because once he asked me to have a\nsleepover at his house and I thought was me finally getting socially accepted only\nfor him in the middle of the night to come up and ask me, \u201cSo who\u2019s going\nto be the boy and the girl?\u201d I was an innocent smol bean who didn\u2019t really\nunderstand what he meant because, to be honest, I didn\u2019t actually understand\nget how babies were made yet. But needless to say I think he was disappointed.\nWow, closeted child turns into homophobic bully. Thanks again society. But this\nwhole primary school journey was really just an amuse-bouche for the full\nsix-course tasting menu of suffering that would be secondary school.</p><p>I went to an all-boys school. It was a literal hellscape. \u00a0I thought it was hard making it through a\nschool of 200 kids with two or three bullies. Try over a thousand where a clean\n800 are fully psychopathic gorillas fueled by testosterone, Red Bull, and\nEminem albums. Making sure that the word f- no longer means an innocent bundle\nof sticks or a cigarette anymore in the British lexicon. Nope, now it was a\ncool homophobic slur along with gay, gaylord, gayboy, puff, pufter, ponce, batty,\nbatty boy, bum-boy, bender. Shit, this is so long. People have a lot of words\nfor something they don\u2019t wanna think about. Look at me in this stupid blazer. Oh,\n\u201cyou\u2019ll grow into it at some point in the next four years\u201d. Thanks,\nMum. Day one, kid in form class, some stupid hedgehog-looking motherfucker side\neyes me and says, \u201cWhat you lookin at, puff?\u201d First interaction at a new\nschool. Great! My entire existence on a daily basis then becomes navigating\nthis school like I\u2019m in the bloody \u201cMaze Runner\u201d trying to avoid\naggressive pricks with chode ties. And you know being verbally abused for being\na nerd or a Greebo at least felt relevant to me at the time. Greebo, definitely\none of my faves there and I\u2019m sure that Korn and Slipknot would have been proud\nto have 12-year-old me as a fan. I kinda knew who I was in the hierarchy at\nthat point. I was essentially a theater kid who spent all of his free time\nplaying Runescape on the AOL browser on his mum\u2019s PC instead of football. I\naccepted it. But at least I wasn\u2019t actually this \u201cgay thing\u201d people kept\nthrowing around because by now I understood a gay is a boy who fancies other\nboys. And to be honest I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019ve ever fancied anyone\nbefore.</p><p>Then puberty happened.</p><p>Oh yeah, this is fun, tingly feelings, I smell bad. It was quite fun\ndribbling on this girl\u2019s face playing Truth or Dare, maybe later we\u2019ll go behind\nthat bike sheds and, there I was sat in English class, my friend next to me. I\nwatched as he delicately removes a pencil from its case. We briefly make eye\ncontact as he flutters his long black eyelashes with a blink before staring\nforward. His eyes are so bright and beautiful yet they seem so sad and deep\nwith emotion. I wish I could just understand. Oh fuck, I think I\u2019m a bit gay. You\u2019re\ntelling me this whole time I actually have been the bad thing that people keep\ncalling me? Shit!</p><p>Chapter 2 \u2013 Feelings</p><p>Oh do you hear it that faint hum, something coming from a deep, dark\nplace too powerful to control? It\u2019s the self-hatred. She is here and she\u2019s only\ngetting started. Short version, I fall hopelessly in love with a friend of mine\nwho doesn\u2019t feel the same way which crushes me into a million tiny pieces and\nyears later actually it turns out he was gay the whole time. He just really\nspecifically didn\u2019t like <i>me</i>. [Double\nkill.] Here I am, 13, crying to evanescence alone in my bedroom feeling like\nthere\u2019s no point in really being alive as I\u2019m clearly a faulty outcast person that\nhas no place in the world. I stopped going to church with my grandma because I\nfelt like I wasn\u2019t really supposed to be there. Also, by this age, the whole\nChristianity thing didn\u2019t really make much sense to me. And the adult services\nwere dry AF compared to coloring in a picture of Jesus\u2019s face at Sunday school.\nSo other than the free tea and biscuits they gave away after the sermon, religion\ndidn\u2019t really have much to offer me. Damn, there was some good biscuits though.\nI miss that. But wait! All is not lost yet. Do you see that? A triumphant,\nrallying cry of guitars, stripey hoodies, and black hair dye. Emo had arrived! I\nswear to God, emo is one of the best things that happened to pop culture in the\nlast 20 years. As well as inventing eyeliner and skinny jeans, a new word hit the\ntheater, nerd, goth, band, kid corner that would change my world forever.</p><p>Bisexual. You can be normal and gay at the same time and some people\nthink it\u2019s cool? Well, slap a long fingerless glove on my arm and sign me up to\nMyspace 'cause Mum, I\u2019m bi. It was a good term 'cause it was a catchall for\nanyone who felt sexually confused or curious that didn\u2019t want to commit to\nsomething stronger which is very me. Big commitment issues. Thanks, fam. To be\nclear, regardless of whatever the 2006 teenagers thoughts and feelings were, being\nbi is valid and should not be excused away or erased by anyone. Thank you.</p><p>From this moment, I was a loud and proud raving bi to my close friends\nand the strangers on the internet who saw my clearly-labeled sexual preference on\nmy Myspace page. And the emo friends I made at this time were awesome. We just\nused to hang and make out with each other and listen to music and drink bottles\nof Smirnoff Ice until we were sick on each other with no judgment. The judgment\ncame several years later looking back at the photos that you can\u2019t delete. So I\ndidn\u2019t need to tell my family or people at school anything. But the thing is\nwith a Myspace page, anyone with an internet connection can read it. And so the\nrumors started spreading through my neighborhood that Dan Howell was in fact a\nbisexual. I had a friend in French class who one day, totally unprompted, just turned\nto me and said, \u201cHmm, yeah, I thought so. You give off a bi-vibe.\u201d A\nbi-vi-, what the fuck is a bi-vibe? Great, yeah, nothing to make a 15-year-old feel\nself-conscious about his behavior like being told he emanates a bisexual aura. What\nam I supposed to do with that? Sorry that I give off mixed signals. I\u2019m\nversatile. Turns out it was actually a social upgrade from being called gay all\nthe time 'cause bisexual was a new word that only referred to sexuality so\npeople actually had to decide how they felt about the fact I was attracted to\nboys. As opposed to gay which as we all understood is synonymous with bad and\nalso implies a general threat, plague, curse/evil force that simply must be\ndestroyed. People at school were actually almost nice to me with curiosity\nabout it and a few of the boys that previously loved to just generically call\nme gay while throwing a compasses at me or something, now started to low key\nflirt with me and some stuff happened. Go figure.</p><p>But then I entered the dark ages and no I\u2019m not talking about my hair because\nI was never actually cool enough to commit to dying it black. As quickly as\nthey arrived into my life, my emo friend group vanished into the night. Like\nthe tip of an eyeliner pencil snapping or the HTML on your intricately-crafted\nMySpace page falling apart when the host websites of your embedded gifs die, so,\ntoo, did my social life. One had to suddenly focus on school, another moved\ntown, two of them just fell out with each other and started hanging out with\ntheir old friends again. Well, we don\u2019t all have back up friend groups, Lindsey!\nI went all in on the emos! You\u2019re telling me I have to go back to sitting in my\nkitchen playing Runescape now! Thanks a lot. So for a year I literally had no\nfriends. And this is when the bullying at school really stepped its pussy up. The\nthings people used to say offhand to me in a corridor were now said loudly in\nclassrooms where everybody would laugh. People used to sing songs about me\nbeing gay on the bus while my fellow nerds sat around me just stared awkwardly\nout of the window not wanting to get involved. They shouted things out during\nGCSE exams in front of the whole school and the low key pushing became punches.\nPeople used to wait for me after school just to throw things at me. Once a guy\nput his hand around my throat and pushed my head against a coat peg in the\nlocker room while everyone was watching and just slapped me for five minutes. But\nI never reacted. I never cried or got angry or fought back 'cause then I\u2019d be\ngiving them what they wanted and I refused to play along. But this way of\ndealing with things definitely had an impact on my relationship with emotion\ngoing into life. I became a total outcast. No one wanted to come near me out of\nfear that they\u2019d get targeted, too. So no one ever stood up for me. And, you\nknow, I don\u2019t blame them. I just resent them even to this day. No, I\u2019m kidding,\nI don\u2019t really. I do. No, I don\u2019t. I, hmm. Teachers at the time obviously did\nnothing. In fact, one of them saw this\nhappening to me and laughed 'cause you know, boys will be boys especially\nthe gay ones that get killed by the other ones, am I right? Ah, classic lad\nbanter. And home. See, keeping this on the topic of sexuality and not economic\nclass, violence, addiction, and health issues, let\u2019s just say some shit was\ngoin\u2019 down. I didn\u2019t think I could ask my family for help or share my feelings\nabout this, mainly due to my dad. Funny guy, kind of a woke hippie who did and\nsaid a lot of things I did respect but at the same time used to walk around the\nhouse saying how he hoped someone he had a problem with at work would *clears\nthroat* \u201cdie of bum cancer.\u201d Yep, so picked the one area to be a\nbigot that would further traumatize your child. Nice! This experience coming\nfrom a childhood hearing the word gay meaninglessly thrown around as an insult\nat home and school, in music, on TV, to then realizing I am actually kinda gay,\nto then very specifically being attacked for it was traumatic. The world was\nclearly telling me if I ever wanted to be accepted by anyone or, in my\nparticular environment, survive, I couldn\u2019t be gay. I was afraid of it, literally\nhomophobic of myself. I am talking Pavlov, sunken place, North Korea-level mind\nalteration that made me terrified of and repulsed by this part of me. This is called\ninternalized oppression. It\u2019s a real thing and it\u2019s some real shit. </p><p>Chapter 3 \u2013 Internalized Oppression</p><p>From this moment I was no longer advertising myself as bi. No, BRB deleting\nthat Myspace real quick, xD lemme get on that Bebo. \u201cMy Chemical\nRomance\u201d? No, I\u2019m listen to what\u2019s this, N-Dubz? Jesus Christ. I go away\nfor the summer break and come back to school quiet and serious and fully\nstraight. *coughs* I needed me some new friends that were a bit higher up the\nsocial ladder, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019 for security so I go ahead and join\n\u201cThe Inbetweeners\u201d. Literally this group of friends, the exact middle\nground between nerds and desperately wanting to be cool. And oh how desperate\nwe were. The great thing about these friends was they knew loads of girls. So\nfirstly, instant cool points. Secondly, if I date a girl *scoffs* super not\ngay. The problem with that was it\u2019s not like everyone just forgot everything\nthat\u2019s been said about me and this group of friends, causally homophobic pretty\nmuch all the time and also they hung out in places near some even more\naggressive and super homophobic peeps. Just full-time Runescape would have been\na better in hindsight. I find myself going through the same shit at school but\nnow voluntarily going through it at the weekends from the people that are\nsupposed to be my friends thinking I\u2019m doing the right thing whilst constantly\ntelling myself I\u2019m now totally heterosexual. So I did what many people choose\nto do at that point and I got a girlfriend. But this is pretty messed up because\nI really liked this girl. In fact, I loved her as a friend and I was genuinely\nattracted to her but I was so afraid of sexuality I didn\u2019t even wanna do\nanything straight in case I had some weird gay panic that I was totally frigid\nand I led her on. And when she got pissed at me, understandably, for being a\nterrible boyfriend, I just felt even worse. This was someone who I liked that I\nwas hurting and lying to but I couldn\u2019t leave as then I\u2019d have no armor.\nBeautiful irony here is having a girlfriend didn\u2019t in any way stop the abuse 'cause\nremember, gay is a great all-purpose general insult. (Call someone gay today\nand we\u2019ll throw in a free set of steak knives.) And when these neighborhood\nteens started heavy drinking and getting into drugs, things suddenly got as\npeople joked about setting fire to a tent as I slept in it at Reading Festival.\nOr saying, \u201cYou know that notoriously unstable guy? Yeah, he said he\u2019s\ngonna kill you next Saturday.\u201d Awkward.</p><p>This was definitely the lowest point in my life. I just felt totally\nalone, confused and I deeply hated myself. I used to ask God, in case he was\nthere, to please, just make me straight and everyone stop. But I saw no end, no\nescape, no way to change the world or who I was. So one evening I thought fuck\nit and I attempted suicide.</p><p>I say attempted, because just before it was too late I thought</p><p>\u201coh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit what have i done what have i done\nfuck fuck fuck fuck fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat will your grandma think don\u2019t do this to her she tried her\nbest and she loves you\u201d</p><p>\u201cyour family aren\u2019t total dicks and this will fuck them up can\u2019t\nyou just get over it surely\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re gonna get to the last year of school and give up now really\nwhat was the point\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard this is one of the most painful ways to die so not a great\nchoice if I\u2019m being blunt\u201d</p><p>Felt kinda bad for a few days otherwise I pretended it never happened\nand I didn\u2019t tell anyone, until now, literally. Hmm, I know pretty dark right,\nbut hey spoiler things kinda worked out. I mean still gotta lot of issues but\nhere I am. I\u2019m so glad I failed for so many reasons, for the people in my life,\nfor the future I would\u2019ve wasted. The most important being that I thought I was\ntrapped in a situation forever when in reality, the entire world I lived in and\nmy life changed completely. I thought it was hopeless when in reality there was\nso much to hope for and that\u2019s it. Time\nchanges everything. With the lives that we have, we can try anything we\u2019ve\ndreamed of. I want anyone that\u2019s ever felt like this to realize you are never\ntrapped. There is always hope. You\njust need to believe in yourself and get to the other side. So yeah school age\n6 to 18, I\u2019m gonna give that a bad Google review. The thing is I did stand out.\nI\u2019ve always been a loudmouth, class clown, annoying shit. Since graduating, it\nturns out half the people I knew were fuckin\u2019 gay. That group of friends I had,\nall lovely people now. Five of them were gay, five gays! That is statistically\nirregular. Oh but they flew under the radar. All I\u2019m saying is I wish people\njust hated me for being annoying and immature. Leave the gays alone!</p><p>My light at the end of the tunnel was university. I was gonna get my A\nlevels move to a new town and ghost these bitches. But I took a gap year first\nto earn some money which was very boring sitting at home and working at ASDA\nwhere I was not happy to help. My shift started at 5 a.m. on a Saturday. Signed\nup for a Twitter account to run my mouth off and then bam. \u201cSo my name is [Dan].\u201d\nMy YouTube story begins, a new chapter of my life to redefine. So you know what\nI do? Get a Formspring because nothing gives you that attention feeling like\none of those anonymous question and answer websites that are inherently toxic\nand no one should use. And straight out of the bat bisexual Dan returns. 'Cause\nhey, just like Myspace, I\u2019m only telling a few people on the internet right\nnow. It\u2019s not like one day I\u2019m gonna get so many followers that random\nstrangers and my family might see it. Wow, I had a lot fun with many different\nkinds of people in 2009. Let\u2019s just say I got a lot out of my system. Got a\ncouple of things in my system, too. Sorry.</p><p>And this is when, through the magic of the internet, I met Phil. And\nobviously we were more than friends but it was more than just romantic. This is\nsomeone that genuinely liked me. I trusted them. And for the first time since I\nwas a tiny child, I actually felt safe. And the relationship we formed at that\npoint was something that I needed in my life. We are real best friends,\ncompanions through life, like actual soulmates, not that souls are a real thing\nthat exist. It\u2019s so lucky to just find someone you can be that compatible with and\nespecially to anyone that has experienced the kind of self-hatred that I have\ndealt with, one person accepting you can make all the difference. And I bet so\nmany people wanna know so much more about that which, honestly, I take as a\ncompliment. But here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m somebody that wants to keep the details\nof my personal life private. So is Phil. I know lots of people these days,\nthanks to social media, want to share and monetize every aspect of their life\nand then as soon as something changes suddenly it\u2019s this huge drama because\neverybody got invested in the story of your life like it\u2019s a soap opera. I\ndon\u2019t want that. I wanna do certain things without an audience. I wanna be\nspontaneous. I don\u2019t wanna feel afraid to take risks. I want to enjoy totally\nfucking something up and not have to post a statement about it. And if anyone\nthinks people really have to share these things about their life, you need to\nrethink your position. And look, I understand that sex is a fun and interesting\nthing to talk about. I get it. I am also a disgusting pervert. But the specific\nminutiae of who I be fuckin\u2019, when, why, where, how long, how, uhh, I mean? Sexuality is a general\nfact that it can be very useful to know about a person for several reasons, but\nwe can\u2019t force people to disclose that either. We don\u2019t know this person\u2019s life\nstory, what they\u2019ve been through, if they haven\u2019t told people, if they\u2019ll lose\ntheir job, if they\u2019re in danger. There are so many reasons someone might not be\nopen about it. We can preach the message that being out is good, but\naggressively speculating or trying to out someone is really bad. They might not\nbe gay, in which case we\u2019re just harassing someone and probably stereotyping. And\nif they are there\u2019s gonna be a reason why they haven\u2019t talked about it. So I don\u2019t\nwanna see any responses to me finally talking about this like no one is\nsurprised. \u201cDan we been knew.\u201d Wow, you huge galaxy brain genius. What\u2019s it\nlike walking around with all those brain cells in there working overtime? What,\nyou got like three in there? Don\u2019t lose your balance, mastermind. I haven\u2019t\nexactly been subtle have I? I\u2019m an awkward, sexually ambiguous nerd. \u201cWhat the\nfuck even is your sexuality?\u201d That\u2019s not the point. I\u2019m already dead inside so\nit doesn\u2019t matter here, but to me if someone\u2019s reaction to a person coming out is\njust, \u201cyeah, I knew\u201d, they\u2019re showing no empathy towards the issue or\nthat person. They\u2019re just making it about themselves like it was a fun piece of\ngossip they already knew. All we have to\ndo is listen and be accepting.</p><p>So anyway back to the tale. Whilst things were looking up for Dan aged\n18, things quickly got messy again. Wow, that beats the emo streak of temporary\nself-acceptance by like six months, nice. There was a point around 2011 where the\nrelationship with my audience shifted from what felt like direct communication\nbetween me and individuals that just saw me as a comedy creator to communities\nof people that formed to talk about me when I wasn\u2019t there. Which is fine, but\nfor some people it was about getting generally invested in me and my real life\nwhich I thought was a bit strange 'cause inevitably like anyone who puts\nthemself out there, some people started to really dig into my private life to\nfind out information about me that I wasn\u2019t ready to share. And this was around\nthe same time that YouTubers finally started to get mainstream recognition in\nthe British press. We had the BBC knocking at our door trying to offer Dan and\nPhil a radio show. From that, Dan and Phil became this entertainment duo that\nwe could have a creative career with. And we love working together, so when all\nthese opportunities came for Dan and Phil, we were really excited but I was\nalso scared as people clearly knew I wasn\u2019t straight and I hadn\u2019t told my\nfamily that. None of my old friends knew about this, and what me and Phil had\nwas ours and personal and yet some people were trying to get access to it for\ntheir own satisfaction. It was no longer a few people on the internet, no big\ndeal. So I just shut down. It felt like I was back at school again, surrounded\nby threatening people trying to expose me for their entertainment. Most I\u2019m\nsure just wanted what was best for me and I feel such genuine sadness and am\nsorry that I couldn\u2019t be closer to and more truthful with the people in my life\nthat were just trying to be nice but I wasn\u2019t ready to deal with it at this\ntime so I had to do something to contain it. I definitely sent some mixed\nmessages. Some were just joking around, others were super defensive that in my\npanic came across like \u201cI\u2019m now telling everyone I\u2019m totally straight\u201d when all\nI really meant was \u201cplease fuck off and don\u2019t invade my privacy, you creepy\nstalkers, thank you\u201d. But this experience seriously triggered some PTSD in me and\nI was back in the dark place. I didn\u2019t want to just disappear from the internet\nto escape it and throw away this creative hobby that actually started paying\nrent. Thanks. So I just decided to put anything to do with my sexuality in a\nbox to come back to later as I was still processing my past and I wanted to\nunderstand my identity on my own terms and timeline and not just have it\nhijacked as fuel for people\u2019s sexual fantasies or some headline in an article. And\nwhilst we\u2019re not exactly living in a utopia yet here on YouTube, the general\ninternet culture only five or six years ago was a much less wholesome,\nprogressive place as this little bubble is now. Sure, a lot of people probably\nwould have been supportive, but there was just as much open bigotry and general\ntoxicity 'cause people felt less accountable and it was okay to say certain\nthings 'cause it\u2019s just on the internet and I couldn\u2019t handle that at the time.\nAnd, generally, I can handle a\nlot. I have big hands with a very wide reach for playing piano, you fucking..\nget your mind out of the gutter. We can\u2019t ask people to just put their lives on\nhold to address their sexuality first. If a kid dreams of being a footballer\nand age 18 gets signed to a club and all their dreams come true but they\u2019re\nscared to come out because of the insane homophobia in that community, they\nshouldn\u2019t turn it down. Yes, it\u2019s so important to be truthful about who you are\nand open and proud in front of the world but it\u2019s our society\u2019s fault that\nthese people are scared to say who they are. So let\u2019s all focus on making it a\nwelcoming place and people will come out when they are ready. So when was I\nready? Well, it\u2019s always been on my mind that I need to talk about this at some\npoint. I couldn\u2019t just keep going forward in my life ignoring it, not only just\nso I can be authentic, which is very important for general existing, but also\njust letting people know what kind of sexual attention I want from the world. All\nof it from everyone. God I\u2019m so thirsty. And if anything motivated me, it\u2019s the\nidea that I can help someone else 'cause that\u2019s basically my whole career,\nisn\u2019t it, admitting to shit that I\u2019ve been through so you will feel better\nabout yourselves. There we go, you\u2019re welcome. I have a platform and a following\nof millions of people, many of whom I know have been through exactly what I\nhave. And if I tell my story as painful and flip floppy and flawed as it is, I\nknow it mean something to someone as every time someone speaks openly about\nsexuality, it saves lives. I\u2019d never met a single out gay person until I was\n18. And if I had, or even just seen better representation in the media, I\nwouldn\u2019t have felt so totally alone. I wouldn\u2019t even be saying this to you now\nif it wasn\u2019t for TV shows, musicians, and public figures in the last couple\nyears reinforcing this to me. It doesn\u2019t matter if I was living the life\nprivately as there was still so much confusion about my feelings and fear. But\nthings are better now, on the internet, on TV, in my real life. It\u2019s not\nperfect but it feels safe enough in this space right now for me to feel\nconfident. So thank you, sincerely, to all the brave people that came before me\nand to any of you that made this world seem welcoming for me. And instead of\nprocrastinating from this by focusing on work, which was a way for me to insure\nmy own independence and survival in case I was rejected, or just doing things for\nother people to take my mind off it instead of asserting my own needs, which my\ntherapist keeps telling me is one of my biggest problems. Here I am with a\nfresh void of time in front of me to fuck up however I want. Now look, we all\nhave different experiences in life. Some of us are lucky, some of us not. It\njust so happened that the first 18 years of my life were horrendously shit. It\nfailed me. But we get dealt cards from the start, too. If you look at my life,\nI was born into this world as an able-bodied, white, cis-man in Britain which\nimmediately gives me so much privilege in this current world and I am fully\naware of how much harder making it to today could have been for me, which is\nwhy we all need to stand up for equality and social justice even if it doesn\u2019t\napply to us. No one stood up for me when it mattered the most and that almost\ncost me everything. So if you see a woman being harassed, a gay being\nthreatened, someone muttering something racist, say something, do something because\nif you\u2019re still or silent, the victim will just think that you are against\nthem, too. We all have a responsibility.</p><p>This tale was just some of the stuff relating to sexuality. We all have\na whole sob story if we wanna tell it but I just wanted to explain the journey of\nhow I got to this point and overcame the obstacles that tried to block this\npath. And now I\u2019ve arrived.</p><p>Chapter 4 \u2013 Labels</p><p>Okay cool story, bro, it\u2019s answer time. What\u2019s your answer. Whaddayalikedafuk?\nHere\u2019s the thing, you want me to talk candidly about sexuality as if it\u2019s something\nthat I understand? I don\u2019t know what it is, why it is. Turns out no one knows. I\u2019ve\nbeen sitting here for years waiting for scientists to just work it out like\nbleep bloop. [Oh this is why and exactly how it\u2019s different for people. There\nwe go.] Thinking I shouldn\u2019t run off my mouth on the internet in case my\ntheories and opinions on varying gayness get debunked next week. Well, I waited\nlong enough and it didn\u2019t happen. Science, ya fucked up, you let me down. And I\nfully expect to have to delete this video in two weeks when you find out all\nthe answers suddenly. Thanks a bunch. What makes someone gay or straight or all\nthe things in between? What the ever loving fuck is gender about? This is a\nmess. Yet people want you to give them a word because that\u2019s how humans\ncommunicate with words that have meanings. Which is why our disgusting species\nis impatient, stupid, and obsessed with labels. And this applies to everything,\nsexuality, gender, political identity, what obscure genre of synthwave you\nlisten to. People just want a label that represents something they understand\nso they already know how to feel about you and don\u2019t have to bother thinking. [Oh\nyou\u2019re a feminist well I don\u2019t need to know anything more. Oh you\u2019re a leftist.\nOh you\u2019re a K-pop fan but but but but.] If people just want to find a way to\ndisagree with you or dislike you, they can refer to the label and turn off\ntheir brains. Hey, what does my label say? Huh. The issue is, especially when\nwe start talking about the writhing mass of confusion and suffering that is\nsexual and gender identity, the limits of language and specific terminology\nbecome a big problem. What does being gay mean? You never thought about a boob\nonce? What does being a man mean? You wanna be an emotionless rock rubbing raw\nsteaks against your biceps? It\u2019s not like humanity is all in agreement right\nnow. I don\u2019t like the stereotypes and drama that come with all this terminology\nso I\u2019m just not gonna use it. Thing is gender identity isn\u2019t my issue. I feel\ncomfortable with the identity that I\u2019ve had my whole life. Dan, a tol boy from\nEngland. But being a man means nothing to me. I wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable\nwearing makeup or a sickening pair of heels, though I can\u2019t even draw in a\nstraight line so that would be a disaster. Also is anyone really comfortable\nwearing heels? Hmm. Icons of masculinity aren\u2019t really a big part of my life.\nMight as well call me a fucking formless blob that sounds more relatable. Shout\nout to all my formless blobs out there, rise up. I don\u2019t have to do anything or\nbe anything and I personally wouldn\u2019t feel offended if I wasn\u2019t referred to as\na he. Well, she\u2019s feeling hungry today. Stop fucking judging me, Susan. I\u2019m sad\nand I\u2019m gonna eat this whole damn cake whether you like it or not. But anyone\nthat has this don\u2019t really care attitude about their gender identity is in a\nway privileged 'cause some people, especially trans, care a lot about their\ngender identity and using the correct pronouns which other people should\nrespect. Likewise with sexuality, whilst to me the endlessly increasing list of\ntribes and flags being flown is a bit daunting and confusing and personally stresses\nme out 'cause I almost find it constrictive, some people like it. Because if\nyou\u2019re feelings are confusing and then you look at a word that represents\nsomething and go, \u201cwow, that me\u201d, it can help you realize you\u2019re valid and find\na community and that\u2019s great. There is so much controversy around this issue\nand others but if we all just calm down, respect each other\u2019s experiences and\ntry to just be nice, reasonable people, which is a lot to ask, let\u2019s be real,\nit\u2019s quite simple. If you wanna use language to express your honest feelings\nand identity, that\u2019s great and other people should respect what you say.\nLikewise, if you hate labels and you just wanna be a formless blob, that\u2019s\nfine, too. No one should force you. The only thing that isn\u2019t cool is telling\nother people what they should or should not identify as 'cause that ain\u2019t your problem\nor your business, bye. This was one of the things that held me back from\ntalking about this for years. Shit\u2019s confusing, man. Let\u2019s just go back to\ncellular reproduction by mytosis so I don\u2019t really have to be specific. Two\npeople that I really look up to and respect, Harry Styles and Janelle Monae, both\nfamously say that they don\u2019t feel the need to label it which, to be honest, is\nhow I feel and is perfectly okay. But I get it, for me, you want a word. Oh,\nthat\u2019s hard, though. I\u2019m an annoying guy. I feel uncertain specifying my\nsexuality in the same way I wouldn\u2019t say I am an atheist. Who the fuck am I to\nsay whether God does or doesn\u2019t exist? I don\u2019t know shit 'bout shit and neither\ndoes anyone else. I mean I think it\u2019s unlikely in the same way I know I like DICK.\nBut I\u2019m not gonna pretend to have a definite answer here. Looking at my public\nstatements is inconsistent and confusing. Looking at my personal track record\nthrough life is super confusing. And looking at the void inside my soul\nthreatening to crush the entire universe with the force of its event horizon of\nmisery and melodrama, well, fuck let\u2019s close that shit up. One thing\u2019s for sure\nwhatever heterosexual is, I ain\u2019t it. Really if you ask me, I don\u2019t think\nanyone\u2019s totally straight. I think there\u2019s a lot of social and emotional issues\ngetting in the way of yet to be understood feelings of attraction that can be\nvery flexible. And trust me, I\u2019ve known a lot of straight guys until a couple\nof drinks, some deep conversation, and lingering eye contact, and suddenly they\njust start leaning in. What does that make them? And am I totally gay? No. Am I\nslightly more gay or is it just easier for gays to hook up with each other\nbecause of societal norms. It\u2019s not like the signs for male and female\nbathrooms are what I\u2019m attracted to. I don\u2019t care what flesh organ you have\nbetween your legs, what your hair\u2019s like, if you\u2019re covered in it or a fuckin\u2019\nbeluga whale. I\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019m not picky. I\u2019m easy. So am I bi or pan\nor poly? Well, now we\u2019re just in a clusterfuck of defining language and I\u2019m\nconfused and sad and horny. This is why I personally love the word queer. I\nunderstand that some people don\u2019t as it is a slur but as someone that\u2019s been\nthe target of it several times throughout my life I\u2019m up for some reclamation.\nIt\u2019s like recycling. The definition makes sense because until society is equal\nwith all sexual and gender identifies, it is literally strange from a\nconventional viewpoint plus it\u2019s better than a super long acronym, it\u2019s\ninclusive of everyone and therefore great for formless blobs. There we go, an\nidentity I feel comfortable with. A highly-strung, depressed queer praying for\na giant meteor to hurry up and finally eradicate humanity. LMAO, yeet!</p><p>But to come full circle, I know that even today, deep in my heart the\nword gay scares me because that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been conditioned my whole life. So,\nyou know what? Fuck the literal definition and the scientific definition and\nwhat everyone thinks. I finally have to just confront and accept this.</p><p>I\u2019m gay.</p><p>Oh look, didn\u2019t spontaneously fucking combust. Well, there we go, that\nwas a lot of stress about nothing, wasn\u2019t it? Bloody hell. So yup, I\u2019m here,\nI\u2019m queer, and don\u2019t worry I\u2019m still filled with existential fear.</p><p>WE\u2019RE HERE, WE\u2019RE QUEER WE\u2019RE FILLED WITH EXISTENTIAL FEAR. </p><p>Chapter 5 \u2013 Fear</p><p>Even though I\u2019m at this current place, there is still so much I\u2019m afraid\nof and this has taken months to make because of that. Telling my family was a\nbig fear. I have problems connecting with them emotionally because reasons. So\nI only came out to them this month and if it didn\u2019t go well, as I\u2019m now the\nindependent adult that I fought so hard to be, I was ready to cut them off like\nthe bottom of a sweater turning into a seasonal crop. But I didn\u2019t have to,\nlove you. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d reject me these days but coming out is still a\nsurprise. It changes things. And I\u2019m a pretty awkward person generally but the\nidea of just dropping this in conversation in front of them all terrified me. And\nI tried several times this year to do it but I just couldn\u2019t. So you know how I\nfinally came out to my family? E-mail. Yep, I literally just sent them an e-mail\nsaying and I quote, </p><p>\u201cHello gang. I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you all for a while,\nsomething quite important that should be disclosed at some point. I thought I\nwould around Christmas, then Mum\u2019s birthday, then last Easter Sunday, etc., but\nevery time I meant to, I either felt like I would ruin the mood of the day or I\njust felt awkward and didn\u2019t want to. So I decided just to email you all\ninstead which is really inappropriate and just weird but that somehow seems\nappropriate for me and at least I\u2019ll just finally say it. </p><p>Basically I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><p>Yup. It was just getting ridiculous so I thought screw it and hey, it\nworked. Turns out my remaining family, pretty chill bunch of people. Even my\nChristian grandma said this,</p><p>\u201cWe love you for being you. It must be a great relief to finally acknowledge\nwho you are. Popsie and I just want you to be happy. People are born as they\nare and have no say in it. I hope that now you will feel free to live your life\nas you want with no pretense.\u201d</p><p>Aw.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the iPad.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I said I\u2019d give her my old iPad. She mainly cares about that I\nthing. Wasn\u2019t so sure when I was 17 but it went well now and I know that makes\nme lucky but, hey, it shows that times change. As for the other people in my\nlife, obviously all the friends I have now are cool. If anyone in my life I\u2019ve\never known isn\u2019t cool with it then I don\u2019t care. And sure here online there\nmight be a few incredibly lost bigots following me or just some classic trolls\nwho I think should get fucked. No, like literally, I think you should try it.\nYou\u2019ll probably enjoy it and you might learn something about yourself. Inevitably\nsome of you watching this might have a weird reaction if you just feel like it\nwas a shock or you feel hurt that I kept it from you. But I feel like I\nexplained myself reasonably here and going forward I can\u2019t have any space for\nthat, sorry. I\u2019ve come to terms with who I am and now you have to, too, ha. Funnily\nenough straight up homophobia is probably the one thing I\u2019m not that afraid of,\nbecause I just don\u2019t agree so it doesn\u2019t hold much emotional power over me but\nyou bet I\u2019m opening myself up to all new kinds of in real life and international\ndiscrimination now which is fun. But one of the other big fears holding me back\nwas, honestly, that I wouldn\u2019t be accepted by the community. I know that it\u2019s a\nbig pride flag covering a lot of ground and even the idea of it and certainly\nmost of it is amazing. But there is a lot of drama within it right now\nespecially on the internet. You\u2019ve got Grindr gays arguing about how manly gays\nshould be, bi\u2019s getting ignored, trans people, especially of color, not being\nhistorically appreciated, acephobia, fucking SWERFs and TERFs. No thank you. So\neven though they my people, I know some of them will have problems with\nsomething. And even then, just seeing such a loud and proud, strong and\nopinionated group of people celebrating something just intimidates a smol\nintrovert such as myself. And in my mind if these people don\u2019t accept me because\nI\u2019m not being definitive enough or I took too long then I almost feel like I\u2019ll\nbe alone all over again, and this is a fear that a lot of people have honestly.\nBut I\u2019m a nice guy and I\u2019m trying my best so you better be welcoming, you bunch\nof fuckin\u2019 queers. And obviously with the topic of sexuality, it doesn\u2019t matter\nwhere we are or how far you think we\u2019ve come, by merely mentioning it, I will\nbe opening up a primordial box of bullshit which will include every single\nstupid argument and question since the dawn of time. [It\u2019s not natural.]\nThere\u2019s gay animals. [Adam and Steve.] That\u2019s based on a story and the\nprotagonist that arrives later probably doesn\u2019t agree with you. [Why can\u2019t we\nhave straight pride?] I could spend 10 hours on all the classic crap and people\nwould still be asking the same things. This being posted on the internet, my\nhopes are so incredibly low, lower than my self-esteem. \u00a0Wow, that is unhealthy. I need to stop doing\nthat. This video is about internalized oppression and the problems of language.\nI\u2019m not here to pontificate on every topic tangentially related to the entire\nconcept of gayness. *ASMR voice*: Pontificate on every topic tangentially\nrelated to the concept of gayness. \u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s other humans and all the time in the world left for that. The\ntime in the world coincidentally being not much longer. Climate change LMAO.\nBut I had to tell my story so people would understand me and these things. Why\ncoming out is still a big deal because queer people are often invisible and\nsuffering until they have to do it. Some people grow up in supportive\nenvironments and it\u2019s a positive experience. But more likely, especially around\nthe world outside of the big cities, it isn\u2019t. This is not a fight that is\nanywhere near over. Even in Britain today people are debating whether children\nshould be taught to be accepting of sexual and gender identity in school. </p><p>Queer people exist. Choosing not to accept them is not an option. </p><p>To anyone watching this that isn\u2019t out, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay. You were\nborn this way, it\u2019s right, and anyone that has a problem with it is wrong.\nBased on your circumstance, you might not feel ready to tell people yet or that\nit\u2019s safe and that\u2019s fine, too. Just know that living your truth, with pride,\nis the way to be happy. You are valid. It gets so much better. And the future\nis clear. It\u2019s pretty\nqueer. </p><p>So there we go. Now I can proceed authentically in my life with full\ndisclosure. Cute mutuals know to slide into the DMs. And you can all fuck off\nand leave me alone.</p><p>Bye.</p>",

Shh it\u2019s okay.\n[[MORE]]\n</p><p>What it means is people are presumed to be straight. If you\u2019re not, then\nat some point, you have to \u201ccome out\u201d, which is a whole thing. Or people might\njust try and guess based on something you do or the way you act, because yay\nstereotypes. So this is something you have to be clear on, because if you\u2019re\nnot, how are all these other people that aren\u2019t you going to cope? But I\u2019m\npretty sure no one that knows me thinks I\u2019m straight. So I don\u2019t really need to\ncome out as much as just clarify what the hell is going on. As here I am at age\n27 and my sexual preference is seemingly still a vague, debatable, confusing,\nimpenetrable mystery. But why? And what is it? Well, those are some big\nquestions. Are you sure you wanna know my answers?</p><p>[YES]</p><p>Okay, well, if you say so \u2018cause this is a complicated and sensitive\nissue and when it comes to me, boy, there is a lot to unpack here and it is a\ntotal clusterfuck. So strap yourselves in and let me tell you a queer little\nstory about a boy named Dan.</p><p>Chapter 1 \u2013 The Word</p><p>\u266a When I was a young boy \u266a</p><p>\u266a My father \u266a</p><p>Didn\u2019t have much time for me because my conception was clearly an\naccident and he was a narcissistic proud man suddenly inconvenienced in the\nprime of his life and this emotional neglect gave me lasting problems. </p><p>Sorry that\u2019s not all relevant right now.</p><p>I was an only child for seven years and with working parents. This meant\nI had to make my own fun so I was imaginative \u00a0and loud which is something that my teachers used\nto say quite a lot followed by, \u201cHowever.\u201d Here I am age five. Look\nat me. Cute, poised, sassy, turning out this photo shoot like sorry, Grandma, I\nstunted on this set. Are you seeing this? In almost every way, I literally\npeaked age five. I loved being the center of attention. People said I had an\ninfectious happiness, that my beaming smile brought them hope and joy. People\nthat know me are laughing right now. But a boy, in the '90s being happy and\ngenerally polite acting? Sounds kinda GAY if you ask me. Literally, masculinity\nwas so fragile, people were so proud and scared and society so aggressive that\na boy smiling!?.. appearing to be empathetic or in any way emoting was seen as\na threat. How dare they laugh and feel comfortable? They must be soft and weak\nand girly and GAY. So basically thanks, Grandma, for raising me to be a nice\nchild, you dick. Just kidding. That\u2019s a joke and I told you not to watch this\nvideo because it would be rude so if you send me a disappointed text telling me\nyou\u2019re offended, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Although, now I think about it,\nyou did make me go to church for 10 years, which in hindsight probably also\ndidn\u2019t help \u266a Hallelujah \u266a the issue here so. But then it was time for little\nDan to go to school and this is when it \u00a0</p><p> \u266a All went wrong \u266a</p><p>'Cause it turns out most children, evil pieces of shit. Doesn\u2019t matter\nif you try to raise a happy innocent child, throw that kid into school, aka, a\nliteral Mad Max Battle Royale with the feral offspring of your local community.\nYeah, that crap\u2019ll be undone in about two weeks. I was six years old running\naround the playground pretending to be Sonic the Hedgehog or something when two\nbrothers come up to me aged seven and eight with an unexplained aggressive look\nin their eye. And the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach,\nand just says, \u201cGAY.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time I ever heard that word. Well, I don\u2019t know what\nthe heck gay means but apparently it means people kick you on the floor so that\nain\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t know this child or give them any cause to have an opinion\non me. And, actually, I never directly interacted with them again. What epic clustershit\nof failed parenting and general culture brought this tiny child to get angry and\nattack someone, then call them gay for looking like they were having fun\noutside. Are you okay, 1990s? And so my relationship with sexuality began. </p><p>I wasn\u2019t looking to define myself as a child indiscriminately playing\ndoctors and nurses with various friends until once somebody\u2019s mum walked into a\nroom to find three fully naked children sat on a bed sticking sellotape to each\nother\u2019s butts. Yep, which I don\u2019t recommend. Also, Jesus Christ, the poor woman\nthat saw that. Then you get to the magic age around 10 or 11 where everybody\nsuddenly wants to pretend they\u2019re totally a \u201ccool teenager\u201d who\u2019s doing all the\ndrugs and the sex and the fights, totally. Boy, gay was a really popular word\nback then. </p><p> [[Boy] Uh, homework is gay. [Girl]\nUh, my mum\u2019s so gay. [Boy] Uh, you touched a girl, gay.]</p><p>This one little shit who I won\u2019t name was one of the school bullies and\nhe loved the word gay. He had it in for me and I have no idea why. You know me,\nMr. Winnie the Pooh Meets Slender Man. Well, when I was 10 just Winnie the\nPooh. I didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 to no one ever and yet this guy used my pacifism as a\npunching bag where any group situation was an excuse to single me out call me\ngay for some reason and then make everyone else exclude me because they were\nscared of him. I had a girlfriend. We dated for six whole weeks. We kissed in a\ngame of spin the bottle once by literally sucking on each other\u2019s faces. Then\nshe ended dumping me over speakerphone at a birthday party that everyone in my\nclass but me was invited to but, hey. I don\u2019t know what I was doing wrong, but\nat this age, I understood one thing. Being gay, whatever that meant, was clearly\nthe worst thing you could be. On a Darwinian level, I was being told, okay\nbitch, \u201cSurvival Code\u201d. Don\u2019t be this apparently. Evolution. Plot\ntwist, this bully I think he was a bit gay because once he asked me to have a\nsleepover at his house and I thought was me finally getting socially accepted only\nfor him in the middle of the night to come up and ask me, \u201cSo who\u2019s going\nto be the boy and the girl?\u201d I was an innocent smol bean who didn\u2019t really\nunderstand what he meant because, to be honest, I didn\u2019t actually understand\nget how babies were made yet. But needless to say I think he was disappointed.\nWow, closeted child turns into homophobic bully. Thanks again society. But this\nwhole primary school journey was really just an amuse-bouche for the full\nsix-course tasting menu of suffering that would be secondary school.</p><p>I went to an all-boys school. It was a literal hellscape. \u00a0I thought it was hard making it through a\nschool of 200 kids with two or three bullies. Try over a thousand where a clean\n800 are fully psychopathic gorillas fueled by testosterone, Red Bull, and\nEminem albums. Making sure that the word f- no longer means an innocent bundle\nof sticks or a cigarette anymore in the British lexicon. Nope, now it was a\ncool homophobic slur along with gay, gaylord, gayboy, puff, pufter, ponce, batty,\nbatty boy, bum-boy, bender. Shit, this is so long. People have a lot of words\nfor something they don\u2019t wanna think about. Look at me in this stupid blazer. Oh,\n\u201cyou\u2019ll grow into it at some point in the next four years\u201d. Thanks,\nMum. Day one, kid in form class, some stupid hedgehog-looking motherfucker side\neyes me and says, \u201cWhat you lookin at, puff?\u201d First interaction at a new\nschool. Great! My entire existence on a daily basis then becomes navigating\nthis school like I\u2019m in the bloody \u201cMaze Runner\u201d trying to avoid\naggressive pricks with chode ties. And you know being verbally abused for being\na nerd or a Greebo at least felt relevant to me at the time. Greebo, definitely\none of my faves there and I\u2019m sure that Korn and Slipknot would have been proud\nto have 12-year-old me as a fan. I kinda knew who I was in the hierarchy at\nthat point. I was essentially a theater kid who spent all of his free time\nplaying Runescape on the AOL browser on his mum\u2019s PC instead of football. I\naccepted it. But at least I wasn\u2019t actually this \u201cgay thing\u201d people kept\nthrowing around because by now I understood a gay is a boy who fancies other\nboys. And to be honest I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019ve ever fancied anyone\nbefore.</p><p>Then puberty happened.</p><p>Oh yeah, this is fun, tingly feelings, I smell bad. It was quite fun\ndribbling on this girl\u2019s face playing Truth or Dare, maybe later we\u2019ll go behind\nthat bike sheds and, there I was sat in English class, my friend next to me. I\nwatched as he delicately removes a pencil from its case. We briefly make eye\ncontact as he flutters his long black eyelashes with a blink before staring\nforward. His eyes are so bright and beautiful yet they seem so sad and deep\nwith emotion. I wish I could just understand. Oh fuck, I think I\u2019m a bit gay. You\u2019re\ntelling me this whole time I actually have been the bad thing that people keep\ncalling me? Shit!</p><p>Chapter 2 \u2013 Feelings</p><p>Oh do you hear it that faint hum, something coming from a deep, dark\nplace too powerful to control? It\u2019s the self-hatred. She is here and she\u2019s only\ngetting started. Short version, I fall hopelessly in love with a friend of mine\nwho doesn\u2019t feel the same way which crushes me into a million tiny pieces and\nyears later actually it turns out he was gay the whole time. He just really\nspecifically didn\u2019t like <i>me</i>. [Double\nkill.] Here I am, 13, crying to evanescence alone in my bedroom feeling like\nthere\u2019s no point in really being alive as I\u2019m clearly a faulty outcast person that\nhas no place in the world. I stopped going to church with my grandma because I\nfelt like I wasn\u2019t really supposed to be there. Also, by this age, the whole\nChristianity thing didn\u2019t really make much sense to me. And the adult services\nwere dry AF compared to coloring in a picture of Jesus\u2019s face at Sunday school.\nSo other than the free tea and biscuits they gave away after the sermon, religion\ndidn\u2019t really have much to offer me. Damn, there was some good biscuits though.\nI miss that. But wait! All is not lost yet. Do you see that? A triumphant,\nrallying cry of guitars, stripey hoodies, and black hair dye. Emo had arrived! I\nswear to God, emo is one of the best things that happened to pop culture in the\nlast 20 years. As well as inventing eyeliner and skinny jeans, a new word hit the\ntheater, nerd, goth, band, kid corner that would change my world forever.</p><p>Bisexual. You can be normal and gay at the same time and some people\nthink it\u2019s cool? Well, slap a long fingerless glove on my arm and sign me up to\nMyspace 'cause Mum, I\u2019m bi. It was a good term 'cause it was a catchall for\nanyone who felt sexually confused or curious that didn\u2019t want to commit to\nsomething stronger which is very me. Big commitment issues. Thanks, fam. To be\nclear, regardless of whatever the 2006 teenagers thoughts and feelings were, being\nbi is valid and should not be excused away or erased by anyone. Thank you.</p><p>From this moment, I was a loud and proud raving bi to my close friends\nand the strangers on the internet who saw my clearly-labeled sexual preference on\nmy Myspace page. And the emo friends I made at this time were awesome. We just\nused to hang and make out with each other and listen to music and drink bottles\nof Smirnoff Ice until we were sick on each other with no judgment. The judgment\ncame several years later looking back at the photos that you can\u2019t delete. So I\ndidn\u2019t need to tell my family or people at school anything. But the thing is\nwith a Myspace page, anyone with an internet connection can read it. And so the\nrumors started spreading through my neighborhood that Dan Howell was in fact a\nbisexual. I had a friend in French class who one day, totally unprompted, just turned\nto me and said, \u201cHmm, yeah, I thought so. You give off a bi-vibe.\u201d A\nbi-vi-, what the fuck is a bi-vibe? Great, yeah, nothing to make a 15-year-old feel\nself-conscious about his behavior like being told he emanates a bisexual aura. What\nam I supposed to do with that? Sorry that I give off mixed signals. I\u2019m\nversatile. Turns out it was actually a social upgrade from being called gay all\nthe time 'cause bisexual was a new word that only referred to sexuality so\npeople actually had to decide how they felt about the fact I was attracted to\nboys. As opposed to gay which as we all understood is synonymous with bad and\nalso implies a general threat, plague, curse/evil force that simply must be\ndestroyed. People at school were actually almost nice to me with curiosity\nabout it and a few of the boys that previously loved to just generically call\nme gay while throwing a compasses at me or something, now started to low key\nflirt with me and some stuff happened. Go figure.</p><p>But then I entered the dark ages and no I\u2019m not talking about my hair because\nI was never actually cool enough to commit to dying it black. As quickly as\nthey arrived into my life, my emo friend group vanished into the night. Like\nthe tip of an eyeliner pencil snapping or the HTML on your intricately-crafted\nMySpace page falling apart when the host websites of your embedded gifs die, so,\ntoo, did my social life. One had to suddenly focus on school, another moved\ntown, two of them just fell out with each other and started hanging out with\ntheir old friends again. Well, we don\u2019t all have back up friend groups, Lindsey!\nI went all in on the emos! You\u2019re telling me I have to go back to sitting in my\nkitchen playing Runescape now! Thanks a lot. So for a year I literally had no\nfriends. And this is when the bullying at school really stepped its pussy up. The\nthings people used to say offhand to me in a corridor were now said loudly in\nclassrooms where everybody would laugh. People used to sing songs about me\nbeing gay on the bus while my fellow nerds sat around me just stared awkwardly\nout of the window not wanting to get involved. They shouted things out during\nGCSE exams in front of the whole school and the low key pushing became punches.\nPeople used to wait for me after school just to throw things at me. Once a guy\nput his hand around my throat and pushed my head against a coat peg in the\nlocker room while everyone was watching and just slapped me for five minutes. But\nI never reacted. I never cried or got angry or fought back 'cause then I\u2019d be\ngiving them what they wanted and I refused to play along. But this way of\ndealing with things definitely had an impact on my relationship with emotion\ngoing into life. I became a total outcast. No one wanted to come near me out of\nfear that they\u2019d get targeted, too. So no one ever stood up for me. And, you\nknow, I don\u2019t blame them. I just resent them even to this day. No, I\u2019m kidding,\nI don\u2019t really. I do. No, I don\u2019t. I, hmm. Teachers at the time obviously did\nnothing. In fact, one of them saw this\nhappening to me and laughed 'cause you know, boys will be boys especially\nthe gay ones that get killed by the other ones, am I right? Ah, classic lad\nbanter. And home. See, keeping this on the topic of sexuality and not economic\nclass, violence, addiction, and health issues, let\u2019s just say some shit was\ngoin\u2019 down. I didn\u2019t think I could ask my family for help or share my feelings\nabout this, mainly due to my dad. Funny guy, kind of a woke hippie who did and\nsaid a lot of things I did respect but at the same time used to walk around the\nhouse saying how he hoped someone he had a problem with at work would *clears\nthroat* \u201cdie of bum cancer.\u201d Yep, so picked the one area to be a\nbigot that would further traumatize your child. Nice! This experience coming\nfrom a childhood hearing the word gay meaninglessly thrown around as an insult\nat home and school, in music, on TV, to then realizing I am actually kinda gay,\nto then very specifically being attacked for it was traumatic. The world was\nclearly telling me if I ever wanted to be accepted by anyone or, in my\nparticular environment, survive, I couldn\u2019t be gay. I was afraid of it, literally\nhomophobic of myself. I am talking Pavlov, sunken place, North Korea-level mind\nalteration that made me terrified of and repulsed by this part of me. This is called\ninternalized oppression. It\u2019s a real thing and it\u2019s some real shit. </p><p>Chapter 3 \u2013 Internalized Oppression</p><p>From this moment I was no longer advertising myself as bi. No, BRB deleting\nthat Myspace real quick, xD lemme get on that Bebo. \u201cMy Chemical\nRomance\u201d? No, I\u2019m listen to what\u2019s this, N-Dubz? Jesus Christ. I go away\nfor the summer break and come back to school quiet and serious and fully\nstraight. *coughs* I needed me some new friends that were a bit higher up the\nsocial ladder, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019 for security so I go ahead and join\n\u201cThe Inbetweeners\u201d. Literally this group of friends, the exact middle\nground between nerds and desperately wanting to be cool. And oh how desperate\nwe were. The great thing about these friends was they knew loads of girls. So\nfirstly, instant cool points. Secondly, if I date a girl *scoffs* super not\ngay. The problem with that was it\u2019s not like everyone just forgot everything\nthat\u2019s been said about me and this group of friends, causally homophobic pretty\nmuch all the time and also they hung out in places near some even more\naggressive and super homophobic peeps. Just full-time Runescape would have been\na better in hindsight. I find myself going through the same shit at school but\nnow voluntarily going through it at the weekends from the people that are\nsupposed to be my friends thinking I\u2019m doing the right thing whilst constantly\ntelling myself I\u2019m now totally heterosexual. So I did what many people choose\nto do at that point and I got a girlfriend. But this is pretty messed up because\nI really liked this girl. In fact, I loved her as a friend and I was genuinely\nattracted to her but I was so afraid of sexuality I didn\u2019t even wanna do\nanything straight in case I had some weird gay panic that I was totally frigid\nand I led her on. And when she got pissed at me, understandably, for being a\nterrible boyfriend, I just felt even worse. This was someone who I liked that I\nwas hurting and lying to but I couldn\u2019t leave as then I\u2019d have no armor.\nBeautiful irony here is having a girlfriend didn\u2019t in any way stop the abuse 'cause\nremember, gay is a great all-purpose general insult. (Call someone gay today\nand we\u2019ll throw in a free set of steak knives.) And when these neighborhood\nteens started heavy drinking and getting into drugs, things suddenly got as\npeople joked about setting fire to a tent as I slept in it at Reading Festival.\nOr saying, \u201cYou know that notoriously unstable guy? Yeah, he said he\u2019s\ngonna kill you next Saturday.\u201d Awkward.</p><p>This was definitely the lowest point in my life. I just felt totally\nalone, confused and I deeply hated myself. I used to ask God, in case he was\nthere, to please, just make me straight and everyone stop. But I saw no end, no\nescape, no way to change the world or who I was. So one evening I thought fuck\nit and I attempted suicide.</p><p>I say attempted, because just before it was too late I thought</p><p>\u201coh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit what have i done what have i done\nfuck fuck fuck fuck fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat will your grandma think don\u2019t do this to her she tried her\nbest and she loves you\u201d</p><p>\u201cyour family aren\u2019t total dicks and this will fuck them up can\u2019t\nyou just get over it surely\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re gonna get to the last year of school and give up now really\nwhat was the point\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard this is one of the most painful ways to die so not a great\nchoice if I\u2019m being blunt\u201d</p><p>Felt kinda bad for a few days otherwise I pretended it never happened\nand I didn\u2019t tell anyone, until now, literally. Hmm, I know pretty dark right,\nbut hey spoiler things kinda worked out. I mean still gotta lot of issues but\nhere I am. I\u2019m so glad I failed for so many reasons, for the people in my life,\nfor the future I would\u2019ve wasted. The most important being that I thought I was\ntrapped in a situation forever when in reality, the entire world I lived in and\nmy life changed completely. I thought it was hopeless when in reality there was\nso much to hope for and that\u2019s it. Time\nchanges everything. With the lives that we have, we can try anything we\u2019ve\ndreamed of. I want anyone that\u2019s ever felt like this to realize you are never\ntrapped. There is always hope. You\njust need to believe in yourself and get to the other side. So yeah school age\n6 to 18, I\u2019m gonna give that a bad Google review. The thing is I did stand out.\nI\u2019ve always been a loudmouth, class clown, annoying shit. Since graduating, it\nturns out half the people I knew were fuckin\u2019 gay. That group of friends I had,\nall lovely people now. Five of them were gay, five gays! That is statistically\nirregular. Oh but they flew under the radar. All I\u2019m saying is I wish people\njust hated me for being annoying and immature. Leave the gays alone!</p><p>My light at the end of the tunnel was university. I was gonna get my A\nlevels move to a new town and ghost these bitches. But I took a gap year first\nto earn some money which was very boring sitting at home and working at ASDA\nwhere I was not happy to help. My shift started at 5 a.m. on a Saturday. Signed\nup for a Twitter account to run my mouth off and then bam. \u201cSo my name is [Dan].\u201d\nMy YouTube story begins, a new chapter of my life to redefine. So you know what\nI do? Get a Formspring because nothing gives you that attention feeling like\none of those anonymous question and answer websites that are inherently toxic\nand no one should use. And straight out of the bat bisexual Dan returns. 'Cause\nhey, just like Myspace, I\u2019m only telling a few people on the internet right\nnow. It\u2019s not like one day I\u2019m gonna get so many followers that random\nstrangers and my family might see it. Wow, I had a lot fun with many different\nkinds of people in 2009. Let\u2019s just say I got a lot out of my system. Got a\ncouple of things in my system, too. Sorry.</p><p>And this is when, through the magic of the internet, I met Phil. And\nobviously we were more than friends but it was more than just romantic. This is\nsomeone that genuinely liked me. I trusted them. And for the first time since I\nwas a tiny child, I actually felt safe. And the relationship we formed at that\npoint was something that I needed in my life. We are real best friends,\ncompanions through life, like actual soulmates, not that souls are a real thing\nthat exist. It\u2019s so lucky to just find someone you can be that compatible with and\nespecially to anyone that has experienced the kind of self-hatred that I have\ndealt with, one person accepting you can make all the difference. And I bet so\nmany people wanna know so much more about that which, honestly, I take as a\ncompliment. But here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m somebody that wants to keep the details\nof my personal life private. So is Phil. I know lots of people these days,\nthanks to social media, want to share and monetize every aspect of their life\nand then as soon as something changes suddenly it\u2019s this huge drama because\neverybody got invested in the story of your life like it\u2019s a soap opera. I\ndon\u2019t want that. I wanna do certain things without an audience. I wanna be\nspontaneous. I don\u2019t wanna feel afraid to take risks. I want to enjoy totally\nfucking something up and not have to post a statement about it. And if anyone\nthinks people really have to share these things about their life, you need to\nrethink your position. And look, I understand that sex is a fun and interesting\nthing to talk about. I get it. I am also a disgusting pervert. But the specific\nminutiae of who I be fuckin\u2019, when, why, where, how long, how, uhh, I mean? Sexuality is a general\nfact that it can be very useful to know about a person for several reasons, but\nwe can\u2019t force people to disclose that either. We don\u2019t know this person\u2019s life\nstory, what they\u2019ve been through, if they haven\u2019t told people, if they\u2019ll lose\ntheir job, if they\u2019re in danger. There are so many reasons someone might not be\nopen about it. We can preach the message that being out is good, but\naggressively speculating or trying to out someone is really bad. They might not\nbe gay, in which case we\u2019re just harassing someone and probably stereotyping. And\nif they are there\u2019s gonna be a reason why they haven\u2019t talked about it. So I don\u2019t\nwanna see any responses to me finally talking about this like no one is\nsurprised. \u201cDan we been knew.\u201d Wow, you huge galaxy brain genius. What\u2019s it\nlike walking around with all those brain cells in there working overtime? What,\nyou got like three in there? Don\u2019t lose your balance, mastermind. I haven\u2019t\nexactly been subtle have I? I\u2019m an awkward, sexually ambiguous nerd. \u201cWhat the\nfuck even is your sexuality?\u201d That\u2019s not the point. I\u2019m already dead inside so\nit doesn\u2019t matter here, but to me if someone\u2019s reaction to a person coming out is\njust, \u201cyeah, I knew\u201d, they\u2019re showing no empathy towards the issue or\nthat person. They\u2019re just making it about themselves like it was a fun piece of\ngossip they already knew. All we have to\ndo is listen and be accepting.</p><p>So anyway back to the tale. Whilst things were looking up for Dan aged\n18, things quickly got messy again. Wow, that beats the emo streak of temporary\nself-acceptance by like six months, nice. There was a point around 2011 where the\nrelationship with my audience shifted from what felt like direct communication\nbetween me and individuals that just saw me as a comedy creator to communities\nof people that formed to talk about me when I wasn\u2019t there. Which is fine, but\nfor some people it was about getting generally invested in me and my real life\nwhich I thought was a bit strange 'cause inevitably like anyone who puts\nthemself out there, some people started to really dig into my private life to\nfind out information about me that I wasn\u2019t ready to share. And this was around\nthe same time that YouTubers finally started to get mainstream recognition in\nthe British press. We had the BBC knocking at our door trying to offer Dan and\nPhil a radio show. From that, Dan and Phil became this entertainment duo that\nwe could have a creative career with. And we love working together, so when all\nthese opportunities came for Dan and Phil, we were really excited but I was\nalso scared as people clearly knew I wasn\u2019t straight and I hadn\u2019t told my\nfamily that. None of my old friends knew about this, and what me and Phil had\nwas ours and personal and yet some people were trying to get access to it for\ntheir own satisfaction. It was no longer a few people on the internet, no big\ndeal. So I just shut down. It felt like I was back at school again, surrounded\nby threatening people trying to expose me for their entertainment. Most I\u2019m\nsure just wanted what was best for me and I feel such genuine sadness and am\nsorry that I couldn\u2019t be closer to and more truthful with the people in my life\nthat were just trying to be nice but I wasn\u2019t ready to deal with it at this\ntime so I had to do something to contain it. I definitely sent some mixed\nmessages. Some were just joking around, others were super defensive that in my\npanic came across like \u201cI\u2019m now telling everyone I\u2019m totally straight\u201d when all\nI really meant was \u201cplease fuck off and don\u2019t invade my privacy, you creepy\nstalkers, thank you\u201d. But this experience seriously triggered some PTSD in me and\nI was back in the dark place. I didn\u2019t want to just disappear from the internet\nto escape it and throw away this creative hobby that actually started paying\nrent. Thanks. So I just decided to put anything to do with my sexuality in a\nbox to come back to later as I was still processing my past and I wanted to\nunderstand my identity on my own terms and timeline and not just have it\nhijacked as fuel for people\u2019s sexual fantasies or some headline in an article. And\nwhilst we\u2019re not exactly living in a utopia yet here on YouTube, the general\ninternet culture only five or six years ago was a much less wholesome,\nprogressive place as this little bubble is now. Sure, a lot of people probably\nwould have been supportive, but there was just as much open bigotry and general\ntoxicity 'cause people felt less accountable and it was okay to say certain\nthings 'cause it\u2019s just on the internet and I couldn\u2019t handle that at the time.\nAnd, generally, I can handle a\nlot. I have big hands with a very wide reach for playing piano, you fucking..\nget your mind out of the gutter. We can\u2019t ask people to just put their lives on\nhold to address their sexuality first. If a kid dreams of being a footballer\nand age 18 gets signed to a club and all their dreams come true but they\u2019re\nscared to come out because of the insane homophobia in that community, they\nshouldn\u2019t turn it down. Yes, it\u2019s so important to be truthful about who you are\nand open and proud in front of the world but it\u2019s our society\u2019s fault that\nthese people are scared to say who they are. So let\u2019s all focus on making it a\nwelcoming place and people will come out when they are ready. So when was I\nready? Well, it\u2019s always been on my mind that I need to talk about this at some\npoint. I couldn\u2019t just keep going forward in my life ignoring it, not only just\nso I can be authentic, which is very important for general existing, but also\njust letting people know what kind of sexual attention I want from the world. All\nof it from everyone. God I\u2019m so thirsty. And if anything motivated me, it\u2019s the\nidea that I can help someone else 'cause that\u2019s basically my whole career,\nisn\u2019t it, admitting to shit that I\u2019ve been through so you will feel better\nabout yourselves. There we go, you\u2019re welcome. I have a platform and a following\nof millions of people, many of whom I know have been through exactly what I\nhave. And if I tell my story as painful and flip floppy and flawed as it is, I\nknow it mean something to someone as every time someone speaks openly about\nsexuality, it saves lives. I\u2019d never met a single out gay person until I was\n18. And if I had, or even just seen better representation in the media, I\nwouldn\u2019t have felt so totally alone. I wouldn\u2019t even be saying this to you now\nif it wasn\u2019t for TV shows, musicians, and public figures in the last couple\nyears reinforcing this to me. It doesn\u2019t matter if I was living the life\nprivately as there was still so much confusion about my feelings and fear. But\nthings are better now, on the internet, on TV, in my real life. It\u2019s not\nperfect but it feels safe enough in this space right now for me to feel\nconfident. So thank you, sincerely, to all the brave people that came before me\nand to any of you that made this world seem welcoming for me. And instead of\nprocrastinating from this by focusing on work, which was a way for me to insure\nmy own independence and survival in case I was rejected, or just doing things for\nother people to take my mind off it instead of asserting my own needs, which my\ntherapist keeps telling me is one of my biggest problems. Here I am with a\nfresh void of time in front of me to fuck up however I want. Now look, we all\nhave different experiences in life. Some of us are lucky, some of us not. It\njust so happened that the first 18 years of my life were horrendously shit. It\nfailed me. But we get dealt cards from the start, too. If you look at my life,\nI was born into this world as an able-bodied, white, cis-man in Britain which\nimmediately gives me so much privilege in this current world and I am fully\naware of how much harder making it to today could have been for me, which is\nwhy we all need to stand up for equality and social justice even if it doesn\u2019t\napply to us. No one stood up for me when it mattered the most and that almost\ncost me everything. So if you see a woman being harassed, a gay being\nthreatened, someone muttering something racist, say something, do something because\nif you\u2019re still or silent, the victim will just think that you are against\nthem, too. We all have a responsibility.</p><p>This tale was just some of the stuff relating to sexuality. We all have\na whole sob story if we wanna tell it but I just wanted to explain the journey of\nhow I got to this point and overcame the obstacles that tried to block this\npath. And now I\u2019ve arrived.</p><p>Chapter 4 \u2013 Labels</p><p>Okay cool story, bro, it\u2019s answer time. What\u2019s your answer. Whaddayalikedafuk?\nHere\u2019s the thing, you want me to talk candidly about sexuality as if it\u2019s something\nthat I understand? I don\u2019t know what it is, why it is. Turns out no one knows. I\u2019ve\nbeen sitting here for years waiting for scientists to just work it out like\nbleep bloop. [Oh this is why and exactly how it\u2019s different for people. There\nwe go.] Thinking I shouldn\u2019t run off my mouth on the internet in case my\ntheories and opinions on varying gayness get debunked next week. Well, I waited\nlong enough and it didn\u2019t happen. Science, ya fucked up, you let me down. And I\nfully expect to have to delete this video in two weeks when you find out all\nthe answers suddenly. Thanks a bunch. What makes someone gay or straight or all\nthe things in between? What the ever loving fuck is gender about? This is a\nmess. Yet people want you to give them a word because that\u2019s how humans\ncommunicate with words that have meanings. Which is why our disgusting species\nis impatient, stupid, and obsessed with labels. And this applies to everything,\nsexuality, gender, political identity, what obscure genre of synthwave you\nlisten to. People just want a label that represents something they understand\nso they already know how to feel about you and don\u2019t have to bother thinking. [Oh\nyou\u2019re a feminist well I don\u2019t need to know anything more. Oh you\u2019re a leftist.\nOh you\u2019re a K-pop fan but but but but.] If people just want to find a way to\ndisagree with you or dislike you, they can refer to the label and turn off\ntheir brains. Hey, what does my label say? Huh. The issue is, especially when\nwe start talking about the writhing mass of confusion and suffering that is\nsexual and gender identity, the limits of language and specific terminology\nbecome a big problem. What does being gay mean? You never thought about a boob\nonce? What does being a man mean? You wanna be an emotionless rock rubbing raw\nsteaks against your biceps? It\u2019s not like humanity is all in agreement right\nnow. I don\u2019t like the stereotypes and drama that come with all this terminology\nso I\u2019m just not gonna use it. Thing is gender identity isn\u2019t my issue. I feel\ncomfortable with the identity that I\u2019ve had my whole life. Dan, a tol boy from\nEngland. But being a man means nothing to me. I wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable\nwearing makeup or a sickening pair of heels, though I can\u2019t even draw in a\nstraight line so that would be a disaster. Also is anyone really comfortable\nwearing heels? Hmm. Icons of masculinity aren\u2019t really a big part of my life.\nMight as well call me a fucking formless blob that sounds more relatable. Shout\nout to all my formless blobs out there, rise up. I don\u2019t have to do anything or\nbe anything and I personally wouldn\u2019t feel offended if I wasn\u2019t referred to as\na he. Well, she\u2019s feeling hungry today. Stop fucking judging me, Susan. I\u2019m sad\nand I\u2019m gonna eat this whole damn cake whether you like it or not. But anyone\nthat has this don\u2019t really care attitude about their gender identity is in a\nway privileged 'cause some people, especially trans, care a lot about their\ngender identity and using the correct pronouns which other people should\nrespect. Likewise with sexuality, whilst to me the endlessly increasing list of\ntribes and flags being flown is a bit daunting and confusing and personally stresses\nme out 'cause I almost find it constrictive, some people like it. Because if\nyou\u2019re feelings are confusing and then you look at a word that represents\nsomething and go, \u201cwow, that me\u201d, it can help you realize you\u2019re valid and find\na community and that\u2019s great. There is so much controversy around this issue\nand others but if we all just calm down, respect each other\u2019s experiences and\ntry to just be nice, reasonable people, which is a lot to ask, let\u2019s be real,\nit\u2019s quite simple. If you wanna use language to express your honest feelings\nand identity, that\u2019s great and other people should respect what you say.\nLikewise, if you hate labels and you just wanna be a formless blob, that\u2019s\nfine, too. No one should force you. The only thing that isn\u2019t cool is telling\nother people what they should or should not identify as 'cause that ain\u2019t your problem\nor your business, bye. This was one of the things that held me back from\ntalking about this for years. Shit\u2019s confusing, man. Let\u2019s just go back to\ncellular reproduction by mytosis so I don\u2019t really have to be specific. Two\npeople that I really look up to and respect, Harry Styles and Janelle Monae, both\nfamously say that they don\u2019t feel the need to label it which, to be honest, is\nhow I feel and is perfectly okay. But I get it, for me, you want a word. Oh,\nthat\u2019s hard, though. I\u2019m an annoying guy. I feel uncertain specifying my\nsexuality in the same way I wouldn\u2019t say I am an atheist. Who the fuck am I to\nsay whether God does or doesn\u2019t exist? I don\u2019t know shit 'bout shit and neither\ndoes anyone else. I mean I think it\u2019s unlikely in the same way I know I like DICK.\nBut I\u2019m not gonna pretend to have a definite answer here. Looking at my public\nstatements is inconsistent and confusing. Looking at my personal track record\nthrough life is super confusing. And looking at the void inside my soul\nthreatening to crush the entire universe with the force of its event horizon of\nmisery and melodrama, well, fuck let\u2019s close that shit up. One thing\u2019s for sure\nwhatever heterosexual is, I ain\u2019t it. Really if you ask me, I don\u2019t think\nanyone\u2019s totally straight. I think there\u2019s a lot of social and emotional issues\ngetting in the way of yet to be understood feelings of attraction that can be\nvery flexible. And trust me, I\u2019ve known a lot of straight guys until a couple\nof drinks, some deep conversation, and lingering eye contact, and suddenly they\njust start leaning in. What does that make them? And am I totally gay? No. Am I\nslightly more gay or is it just easier for gays to hook up with each other\nbecause of societal norms. It\u2019s not like the signs for male and female\nbathrooms are what I\u2019m attracted to. I don\u2019t care what flesh organ you have\nbetween your legs, what your hair\u2019s like, if you\u2019re covered in it or a fuckin\u2019\nbeluga whale. I\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019m not picky. I\u2019m easy. So am I bi or pan\nor poly? Well, now we\u2019re just in a clusterfuck of defining language and I\u2019m\nconfused and sad and horny. This is why I personally love the word queer. I\nunderstand that some people don\u2019t as it is a slur but as someone that\u2019s been\nthe target of it several times throughout my life I\u2019m up for some reclamation.\nIt\u2019s like recycling. The definition makes sense because until society is equal\nwith all sexual and gender identifies, it is literally strange from a\nconventional viewpoint plus it\u2019s better than a super long acronym, it\u2019s\ninclusive of everyone and therefore great for formless blobs. There we go, an\nidentity I feel comfortable with. A highly-strung, depressed queer praying for\na giant meteor to hurry up and finally eradicate humanity. LMAO, yeet!</p><p>But to come full circle, I know that even today, deep in my heart the\nword gay scares me because that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been conditioned my whole life. So,\nyou know what? Fuck the literal definition and the scientific definition and\nwhat everyone thinks. I finally have to just confront and accept this.</p><p>I\u2019m gay.</p><p>Oh look, didn\u2019t spontaneously fucking combust. Well, there we go, that\nwas a lot of stress about nothing, wasn\u2019t it? Bloody hell. So yup, I\u2019m here,\nI\u2019m queer, and don\u2019t worry I\u2019m still filled with existential fear.</p><p>WE\u2019RE HERE, WE\u2019RE QUEER WE\u2019RE FILLED WITH EXISTENTIAL FEAR. </p><p>Chapter 5 \u2013 Fear</p><p>Even though I\u2019m at this current place, there is still so much I\u2019m afraid\nof and this has taken months to make because of that. Telling my family was a\nbig fear. I have problems connecting with them emotionally because reasons. So\nI only came out to them this month and if it didn\u2019t go well, as I\u2019m now the\nindependent adult that I fought so hard to be, I was ready to cut them off like\nthe bottom of a sweater turning into a seasonal crop. But I didn\u2019t have to,\nlove you. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d reject me these days but coming out is still a\nsurprise. It changes things. And I\u2019m a pretty awkward person generally but the\nidea of just dropping this in conversation in front of them all terrified me. And\nI tried several times this year to do it but I just couldn\u2019t. So you know how I\nfinally came out to my family? E-mail. Yep, I literally just sent them an e-mail\nsaying and I quote, </p><p>\u201cHello gang. I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you all for a while,\nsomething quite important that should be disclosed at some point. I thought I\nwould around Christmas, then Mum\u2019s birthday, then last Easter Sunday, etc., but\nevery time I meant to, I either felt like I would ruin the mood of the day or I\njust felt awkward and didn\u2019t want to. So I decided just to email you all\ninstead which is really inappropriate and just weird but that somehow seems\nappropriate for me and at least I\u2019ll just finally say it. </p><p>Basically I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><p>Yup. It was just getting ridiculous so I thought screw it and hey, it\nworked. Turns out my remaining family, pretty chill bunch of people. Even my\nChristian grandma said this,</p><p>\u201cWe love you for being you. It must be a great relief to finally acknowledge\nwho you are. Popsie and I just want you to be happy. People are born as they\nare and have no say in it. I hope that now you will feel free to live your life\nas you want with no pretense.\u201d</p><p>Aw.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the iPad.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I said I\u2019d give her my old iPad. She mainly cares about that I\nthing. Wasn\u2019t so sure when I was 17 but it went well now and I know that makes\nme lucky but, hey, it shows that times change. As for the other people in my\nlife, obviously all the friends I have now are cool. If anyone in my life I\u2019ve\never known isn\u2019t cool with it then I don\u2019t care. And sure here online there\nmight be a few incredibly lost bigots following me or just some classic trolls\nwho I think should get fucked. No, like literally, I think you should try it.\nYou\u2019ll probably enjoy it and you might learn something about yourself. Inevitably\nsome of you watching this might have a weird reaction if you just feel like it\nwas a shock or you feel hurt that I kept it from you. But I feel like I\nexplained myself reasonably here and going forward I can\u2019t have any space for\nthat, sorry. I\u2019ve come to terms with who I am and now you have to, too, ha. Funnily\nenough straight up homophobia is probably the one thing I\u2019m not that afraid of,\nbecause I just don\u2019t agree so it doesn\u2019t hold much emotional power over me but\nyou bet I\u2019m opening myself up to all new kinds of in real life and international\ndiscrimination now which is fun. But one of the other big fears holding me back\nwas, honestly, that I wouldn\u2019t be accepted by the community. I know that it\u2019s a\nbig pride flag covering a lot of ground and even the idea of it and certainly\nmost of it is amazing. But there is a lot of drama within it right now\nespecially on the internet. You\u2019ve got Grindr gays arguing about how manly gays\nshould be, bi\u2019s getting ignored, trans people, especially of color, not being\nhistorically appreciated, acephobia, fucking SWERFs and TERFs. No thank you. So\neven though they my people, I know some of them will have problems with\nsomething. And even then, just seeing such a loud and proud, strong and\nopinionated group of people celebrating something just intimidates a smol\nintrovert such as myself. And in my mind if these people don\u2019t accept me because\nI\u2019m not being definitive enough or I took too long then I almost feel like I\u2019ll\nbe alone all over again, and this is a fear that a lot of people have honestly.\nBut I\u2019m a nice guy and I\u2019m trying my best so you better be welcoming, you bunch\nof fuckin\u2019 queers. And obviously with the topic of sexuality, it doesn\u2019t matter\nwhere we are or how far you think we\u2019ve come, by merely mentioning it, I will\nbe opening up a primordial box of bullshit which will include every single\nstupid argument and question since the dawn of time. [It\u2019s not natural.]\nThere\u2019s gay animals. [Adam and Steve.] That\u2019s based on a story and the\nprotagonist that arrives later probably doesn\u2019t agree with you. [Why can\u2019t we\nhave straight pride?] I could spend 10 hours on all the classic crap and people\nwould still be asking the same things. This being posted on the internet, my\nhopes are so incredibly low, lower than my self-esteem. \u00a0Wow, that is unhealthy. I need to stop doing\nthat. This video is about internalized oppression and the problems of language.\nI\u2019m not here to pontificate on every topic tangentially related to the entire\nconcept of gayness. *ASMR voice*: Pontificate on every topic tangentially\nrelated to the concept of gayness. \u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s other humans and all the time in the world left for that. The\ntime in the world coincidentally being not much longer. Climate change LMAO.\nBut I had to tell my story so people would understand me and these things. Why\ncoming out is still a big deal because queer people are often invisible and\nsuffering until they have to do it. Some people grow up in supportive\nenvironments and it\u2019s a positive experience. But more likely, especially around\nthe world outside of the big cities, it isn\u2019t. This is not a fight that is\nanywhere near over. Even in Britain today people are debating whether children\nshould be taught to be accepting of sexual and gender identity in school. </p><p>Queer people exist. Choosing not to accept them is not an option. </p><p>To anyone watching this that isn\u2019t out, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay. You were\nborn this way, it\u2019s right, and anyone that has a problem with it is wrong.\nBased on your circumstance, you might not feel ready to tell people yet or that\nit\u2019s safe and that\u2019s fine, too. Just know that living your truth, with pride,\nis the way to be happy. You are valid. It gets so much better. And the future\nis clear. It\u2019s pretty\nqueer. </p><p>So there we go. Now I can proceed authentically in my life with full\ndisclosure. Cute mutuals know to slide into the DMs. And you can all fuck off\nand leave me alone.</p><p>Bye.</p>",

Secrecy! And a whole lot of internal screaming. Starring Daniel\nHowell. One of the greatest mysteries of our generation. What is Dan\u2019s\nsexuality?\u00bb</p><p>Spoiler alert. I\u2019m not straight. Sex, the foundation of life and the\nonly thing we\u2019re really supposed to do. Everyone\u2019s obsessed with it. You bunch\nof degenerates. In the list of things that identify a person, one of the most\nimportant for other people to know is their sexuality. For, if sex is the\nprimal force propelling all of these humans forward by their hips, they have to\nknow. Are we gonna fuck? Or like could we? Or are you, \u2018cause I\u2019m just\nwondering. Now, we live in a heteronormative world, which is a long scary word\nthat makes people feel attacked for some reason. Shh it\u2019s okay.\n[[MORE]]\n</p><p>What it means is people are presumed to be straight. If you\u2019re not, then\nat some point, you have to \u201ccome out\u201d, which is a whole thing. Or people might\njust try and guess based on something you do or the way you act, because yay\nstereotypes. So this is something you have to be clear on, because if you\u2019re\nnot, how are all these other people that aren\u2019t you going to cope? But I\u2019m\npretty sure no one that knows me thinks I\u2019m straight. So I don\u2019t really need to\ncome out as much as just clarify what the hell is going on. As here I am at age\n27 and my sexual preference is seemingly still a vague, debatable, confusing,\nimpenetrable mystery. But why? And what is it? Well, those are some big\nquestions. Are you sure you wanna know my answers?</p><p>[YES]</p><p>Okay, well, if you say so \u2018cause this is a complicated and sensitive\nissue and when it comes to me, boy, there is a lot to unpack here and it is a\ntotal clusterfuck. So strap yourselves in and let me tell you a queer little\nstory about a boy named Dan.</p><p>Chapter 1 \u2013 The Word</p><p>\u266a When I was a young boy \u266a</p><p>\u266a My father \u266a</p><p>Didn\u2019t have much time for me because my conception was clearly an\naccident and he was a narcissistic proud man suddenly inconvenienced in the\nprime of his life and this emotional neglect gave me lasting problems. </p><p>Sorry that\u2019s not all relevant right now.</p><p>I was an only child for seven years and with working parents. This meant\nI had to make my own fun so I was imaginative \u00a0and loud which is something that my teachers used\nto say quite a lot followed by, \u201cHowever.\u201d Here I am age five. Look\nat me. Cute, poised, sassy, turning out this photo shoot like sorry, Grandma, I\nstunted on this set. Are you seeing this? In almost every way, I literally\npeaked age five. I loved being the center of attention. People said I had an\ninfectious happiness, that my beaming smile brought them hope and joy. People\nthat know me are laughing right now. But a boy, in the '90s being happy and\ngenerally polite acting? Sounds kinda GAY if you ask me. Literally, masculinity\nwas so fragile, people were so proud and scared and society so aggressive that\na boy smiling!?.. appearing to be empathetic or in any way emoting was seen as\na threat. How dare they laugh and feel comfortable? They must be soft and weak\nand girly and GAY. So basically thanks, Grandma, for raising me to be a nice\nchild, you dick. Just kidding. That\u2019s a joke and I told you not to watch this\nvideo because it would be rude so if you send me a disappointed text telling me\nyou\u2019re offended, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Although, now I think about it,\nyou did make me go to church for 10 years, which in hindsight probably also\ndidn\u2019t help \u266a Hallelujah \u266a the issue here so. But then it was time for little\nDan to go to school and this is when it \u00a0</p><p> \u266a All went wrong \u266a</p><p>'Cause it turns out most children, evil pieces of shit. Doesn\u2019t matter\nif you try to raise a happy innocent child, throw that kid into school, aka, a\nliteral Mad Max Battle Royale with the feral offspring of your local community.\nYeah, that crap\u2019ll be undone in about two weeks. I was six years old running\naround the playground pretending to be Sonic the Hedgehog or something when two\nbrothers come up to me aged seven and eight with an unexplained aggressive look\nin their eye. And the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach,\nand just says, \u201cGAY.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time I ever heard that word. Well, I don\u2019t know what\nthe heck gay means but apparently it means people kick you on the floor so that\nain\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t know this child or give them any cause to have an opinion\non me. And, actually, I never directly interacted with them again. What epic clustershit\nof failed parenting and general culture brought this tiny child to get angry and\nattack someone, then call them gay for looking like they were having fun\noutside. Are you okay, 1990s? And so my relationship with sexuality began. </p><p>I wasn\u2019t looking to define myself as a child indiscriminately playing\ndoctors and nurses with various friends until once somebody\u2019s mum walked into a\nroom to find three fully naked children sat on a bed sticking sellotape to each\nother\u2019s butts. Yep, which I don\u2019t recommend. Also, Jesus Christ, the poor woman\nthat saw that. Then you get to the magic age around 10 or 11 where everybody\nsuddenly wants to pretend they\u2019re totally a \u201ccool teenager\u201d who\u2019s doing all the\ndrugs and the sex and the fights, totally. Boy, gay was a really popular word\nback then. </p><p> [[Boy] Uh, homework is gay. [Girl]\nUh, my mum\u2019s so gay. [Boy] Uh, you touched a girl, gay.]</p><p>This one little shit who I won\u2019t name was one of the school bullies and\nhe loved the word gay. He had it in for me and I have no idea why. You know me,\nMr. Winnie the Pooh Meets Slender Man. Well, when I was 10 just Winnie the\nPooh. I didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 to no one ever and yet this guy used my pacifism as a\npunching bag where any group situation was an excuse to single me out call me\ngay for some reason and then make everyone else exclude me because they were\nscared of him. I had a girlfriend. We dated for six whole weeks. We kissed in a\ngame of spin the bottle once by literally sucking on each other\u2019s faces. Then\nshe ended dumping me over speakerphone at a birthday party that everyone in my\nclass but me was invited to but, hey. I don\u2019t know what I was doing wrong, but\nat this age, I understood one thing. Being gay, whatever that meant, was clearly\nthe worst thing you could be. On a Darwinian level, I was being told, okay\nbitch, \u201cSurvival Code\u201d. Don\u2019t be this apparently. Evolution. Plot\ntwist, this bully I think he was a bit gay because once he asked me to have a\nsleepover at his house and I thought was me finally getting socially accepted only\nfor him in the middle of the night to come up and ask me, \u201cSo who\u2019s going\nto be the boy and the girl?\u201d I was an innocent smol bean who didn\u2019t really\nunderstand what he meant because, to be honest, I didn\u2019t actually understand\nget how babies were made yet. But needless to say I think he was disappointed.\nWow, closeted child turns into homophobic bully. Thanks again society. But this\nwhole primary school journey was really just an amuse-bouche for the full\nsix-course tasting menu of suffering that would be secondary school.</p><p>I went to an all-boys school. It was a literal hellscape. \u00a0I thought it was hard making it through a\nschool of 200 kids with two or three bullies. Try over a thousand where a clean\n800 are fully psychopathic gorillas fueled by testosterone, Red Bull, and\nEminem albums. Making sure that the word f- no longer means an innocent bundle\nof sticks or a cigarette anymore in the British lexicon. Nope, now it was a\ncool homophobic slur along with gay, gaylord, gayboy, puff, pufter, ponce, batty,\nbatty boy, bum-boy, bender. Shit, this is so long. People have a lot of words\nfor something they don\u2019t wanna think about. Look at me in this stupid blazer. Oh,\n\u201cyou\u2019ll grow into it at some point in the next four years\u201d. Thanks,\nMum. Day one, kid in form class, some stupid hedgehog-looking motherfucker side\neyes me and says, \u201cWhat you lookin at, puff?\u201d First interaction at a new\nschool. Great! My entire existence on a daily basis then becomes navigating\nthis school like I\u2019m in the bloody \u201cMaze Runner\u201d trying to avoid\naggressive pricks with chode ties. And you know being verbally abused for being\na nerd or a Greebo at least felt relevant to me at the time. Greebo, definitely\none of my faves there and I\u2019m sure that Korn and Slipknot would have been proud\nto have 12-year-old me as a fan. I kinda knew who I was in the hierarchy at\nthat point. I was essentially a theater kid who spent all of his free time\nplaying Runescape on the AOL browser on his mum\u2019s PC instead of football. I\naccepted it. But at least I wasn\u2019t actually this \u201cgay thing\u201d people kept\nthrowing around because by now I understood a gay is a boy who fancies other\nboys. And to be honest I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019ve ever fancied anyone\nbefore.</p><p>Then puberty happened.</p><p>Oh yeah, this is fun, tingly feelings, I smell bad. It was quite fun\ndribbling on this girl\u2019s face playing Truth or Dare, maybe later we\u2019ll go behind\nthat bike sheds and, there I was sat in English class, my friend next to me. I\nwatched as he delicately removes a pencil from its case. We briefly make eye\ncontact as he flutters his long black eyelashes with a blink before staring\nforward. His eyes are so bright and beautiful yet they seem so sad and deep\nwith emotion. I wish I could just understand. Oh fuck, I think I\u2019m a bit gay. You\u2019re\ntelling me this whole time I actually have been the bad thing that people keep\ncalling me? Shit!</p><p>Chapter 2 \u2013 Feelings</p><p>Oh do you hear it that faint hum, something coming from a deep, dark\nplace too powerful to control? It\u2019s the self-hatred. She is here and she\u2019s only\ngetting started. Short version, I fall hopelessly in love with a friend of mine\nwho doesn\u2019t feel the same way which crushes me into a million tiny pieces and\nyears later actually it turns out he was gay the whole time. He just really\nspecifically didn\u2019t like <i>me</i>. [Double\nkill.] Here I am, 13, crying to evanescence alone in my bedroom feeling like\nthere\u2019s no point in really being alive as I\u2019m clearly a faulty outcast person that\nhas no place in the world. I stopped going to church with my grandma because I\nfelt like I wasn\u2019t really supposed to be there. Also, by this age, the whole\nChristianity thing didn\u2019t really make much sense to me. And the adult services\nwere dry AF compared to coloring in a picture of Jesus\u2019s face at Sunday school.\nSo other than the free tea and biscuits they gave away after the sermon, religion\ndidn\u2019t really have much to offer me. Damn, there was some good biscuits though.\nI miss that. But wait! All is not lost yet. Do you see that? A triumphant,\nrallying cry of guitars, stripey hoodies, and black hair dye. Emo had arrived! I\nswear to God, emo is one of the best things that happened to pop culture in the\nlast 20 years. As well as inventing eyeliner and skinny jeans, a new word hit the\ntheater, nerd, goth, band, kid corner that would change my world forever.</p><p>Bisexual. You can be normal and gay at the same time and some people\nthink it\u2019s cool? Well, slap a long fingerless glove on my arm and sign me up to\nMyspace 'cause Mum, I\u2019m bi. It was a good term 'cause it was a catchall for\nanyone who felt sexually confused or curious that didn\u2019t want to commit to\nsomething stronger which is very me. Big commitment issues. Thanks, fam. To be\nclear, regardless of whatever the 2006 teenagers thoughts and feelings were, being\nbi is valid and should not be excused away or erased by anyone. Thank you.</p><p>From this moment, I was a loud and proud raving bi to my close friends\nand the strangers on the internet who saw my clearly-labeled sexual preference on\nmy Myspace page. And the emo friends I made at this time were awesome. We just\nused to hang and make out with each other and listen to music and drink bottles\nof Smirnoff Ice until we were sick on each other with no judgment. The judgment\ncame several years later looking back at the photos that you can\u2019t delete. So I\ndidn\u2019t need to tell my family or people at school anything. But the thing is\nwith a Myspace page, anyone with an internet connection can read it. And so the\nrumors started spreading through my neighborhood that Dan Howell was in fact a\nbisexual. I had a friend in French class who one day, totally unprompted, just turned\nto me and said, \u201cHmm, yeah, I thought so. You give off a bi-vibe.\u201d A\nbi-vi-, what the fuck is a bi-vibe? Great, yeah, nothing to make a 15-year-old feel\nself-conscious about his behavior like being told he emanates a bisexual aura. What\nam I supposed to do with that? Sorry that I give off mixed signals. I\u2019m\nversatile. Turns out it was actually a social upgrade from being called gay all\nthe time 'cause bisexual was a new word that only referred to sexuality so\npeople actually had to decide how they felt about the fact I was attracted to\nboys. As opposed to gay which as we all understood is synonymous with bad and\nalso implies a general threat, plague, curse/evil force that simply must be\ndestroyed. People at school were actually almost nice to me with curiosity\nabout it and a few of the boys that previously loved to just generically call\nme gay while throwing a compasses at me or something, now started to low key\nflirt with me and some stuff happened. Go figure.</p><p>But then I entered the dark ages and no I\u2019m not talking about my hair because\nI was never actually cool enough to commit to dying it black. As quickly as\nthey arrived into my life, my emo friend group vanished into the night. Like\nthe tip of an eyeliner pencil snapping or the HTML on your intricately-crafted\nMySpace page falling apart when the host websites of your embedded gifs die, so,\ntoo, did my social life. One had to suddenly focus on school, another moved\ntown, two of them just fell out with each other and started hanging out with\ntheir old friends again. Well, we don\u2019t all have back up friend groups, Lindsey!\nI went all in on the emos! You\u2019re telling me I have to go back to sitting in my\nkitchen playing Runescape now! Thanks a lot. So for a year I literally had no\nfriends. And this is when the bullying at school really stepped its pussy up. The\nthings people used to say offhand to me in a corridor were now said loudly in\nclassrooms where everybody would laugh. People used to sing songs about me\nbeing gay on the bus while my fellow nerds sat around me just stared awkwardly\nout of the window not wanting to get involved. They shouted things out during\nGCSE exams in front of the whole school and the low key pushing became punches.\nPeople used to wait for me after school just to throw things at me. Once a guy\nput his hand around my throat and pushed my head against a coat peg in the\nlocker room while everyone was watching and just slapped me for five minutes. But\nI never reacted. I never cried or got angry or fought back 'cause then I\u2019d be\ngiving them what they wanted and I refused to play along. But this way of\ndealing with things definitely had an impact on my relationship with emotion\ngoing into life. I became a total outcast. No one wanted to come near me out of\nfear that they\u2019d get targeted, too. So no one ever stood up for me. And, you\nknow, I don\u2019t blame them. I just resent them even to this day. No, I\u2019m kidding,\nI don\u2019t really. I do. No, I don\u2019t. I, hmm. Teachers at the time obviously did\nnothing. In fact, one of them saw this\nhappening to me and laughed 'cause you know, boys will be boys especially\nthe gay ones that get killed by the other ones, am I right? Ah, classic lad\nbanter. And home. See, keeping this on the topic of sexuality and not economic\nclass, violence, addiction, and health issues, let\u2019s just say some shit was\ngoin\u2019 down. I didn\u2019t think I could ask my family for help or share my feelings\nabout this, mainly due to my dad. Funny guy, kind of a woke hippie who did and\nsaid a lot of things I did respect but at the same time used to walk around the\nhouse saying how he hoped someone he had a problem with at work would *clears\nthroat* \u201cdie of bum cancer.\u201d Yep, so picked the one area to be a\nbigot that would further traumatize your child. Nice! This experience coming\nfrom a childhood hearing the word gay meaninglessly thrown around as an insult\nat home and school, in music, on TV, to then realizing I am actually kinda gay,\nto then very specifically being attacked for it was traumatic. The world was\nclearly telling me if I ever wanted to be accepted by anyone or, in my\nparticular environment, survive, I couldn\u2019t be gay. I was afraid of it, literally\nhomophobic of myself. I am talking Pavlov, sunken place, North Korea-level mind\nalteration that made me terrified of and repulsed by this part of me. This is called\ninternalized oppression. It\u2019s a real thing and it\u2019s some real shit. </p><p>Chapter 3 \u2013 Internalized Oppression</p><p>From this moment I was no longer advertising myself as bi. No, BRB deleting\nthat Myspace real quick, xD lemme get on that Bebo. \u201cMy Chemical\nRomance\u201d? No, I\u2019m listen to what\u2019s this, N-Dubz? Jesus Christ. I go away\nfor the summer break and come back to school quiet and serious and fully\nstraight. *coughs* I needed me some new friends that were a bit higher up the\nsocial ladder, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019 for security so I go ahead and join\n\u201cThe Inbetweeners\u201d. Literally this group of friends, the exact middle\nground between nerds and desperately wanting to be cool. And oh how desperate\nwe were. The great thing about these friends was they knew loads of girls. So\nfirstly, instant cool points. Secondly, if I date a girl *scoffs* super not\ngay. The problem with that was it\u2019s not like everyone just forgot everything\nthat\u2019s been said about me and this group of friends, causally homophobic pretty\nmuch all the time and also they hung out in places near some even more\naggressive and super homophobic peeps. Just full-time Runescape would have been\na better in hindsight. I find myself going through the same shit at school but\nnow voluntarily going through it at the weekends from the people that are\nsupposed to be my friends thinking I\u2019m doing the right thing whilst constantly\ntelling myself I\u2019m now totally heterosexual. So I did what many people choose\nto do at that point and I got a girlfriend. But this is pretty messed up because\nI really liked this girl. In fact, I loved her as a friend and I was genuinely\nattracted to her but I was so afraid of sexuality I didn\u2019t even wanna do\nanything straight in case I had some weird gay panic that I was totally frigid\nand I led her on. And when she got pissed at me, understandably, for being a\nterrible boyfriend, I just felt even worse. This was someone who I liked that I\nwas hurting and lying to but I couldn\u2019t leave as then I\u2019d have no armor.\nBeautiful irony here is having a girlfriend didn\u2019t in any way stop the abuse 'cause\nremember, gay is a great all-purpose general insult. (Call someone gay today\nand we\u2019ll throw in a free set of steak knives.) And when these neighborhood\nteens started heavy drinking and getting into drugs, things suddenly got as\npeople joked about setting fire to a tent as I slept in it at Reading Festival.\nOr saying, \u201cYou know that notoriously unstable guy? Yeah, he said he\u2019s\ngonna kill you next Saturday.\u201d Awkward.</p><p>This was definitely the lowest point in my life. I just felt totally\nalone, confused and I deeply hated myself. I used to ask God, in case he was\nthere, to please, just make me straight and everyone stop. But I saw no end, no\nescape, no way to change the world or who I was. So one evening I thought fuck\nit and I attempted suicide.</p><p>I say attempted, because just before it was too late I thought</p><p>\u201coh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit what have i done what have i done\nfuck fuck fuck fuck fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhat will your grandma think don\u2019t do this to her she tried her\nbest and she loves you\u201d</p><p>\u201cyour family aren\u2019t total dicks and this will fuck them up can\u2019t\nyou just get over it surely\u201d</p><p>\u201cyou\u2019re gonna get to the last year of school and give up now really\nwhat was the point\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard this is one of the most painful ways to die so not a great\nchoice if I\u2019m being blunt\u201d</p><p>Felt kinda bad for a few days otherwise I pretended it never happened\nand I didn\u2019t tell anyone, until now, literally. Hmm, I know pretty dark right,\nbut hey spoiler things kinda worked out. I mean still gotta lot of issues but\nhere I am. I\u2019m so glad I failed for so many reasons, for the people in my life,\nfor the future I would\u2019ve wasted. The most important being that I thought I was\ntrapped in a situation forever when in reality, the entire world I lived in and\nmy life changed completely. I thought it was hopeless when in reality there was\nso much to hope for and that\u2019s it. Time\nchanges everything. With the lives that we have, we can try anything we\u2019ve\ndreamed of. I want anyone that\u2019s ever felt like this to realize you are never\ntrapped. There is always hope. You\njust need to believe in yourself and get to the other side. So yeah school age\n6 to 18, I\u2019m gonna give that a bad Google review. The thing is I did stand out.\nI\u2019ve always been a loudmouth, class clown, annoying shit. Since graduating, it\nturns out half the people I knew were fuckin\u2019 gay. That group of friends I had,\nall lovely people now. Five of them were gay, five gays! That is statistically\nirregular. Oh but they flew under the radar. All I\u2019m saying is I wish people\njust hated me for being annoying and immature. Leave the gays alone!</p><p>My light at the end of the tunnel was university. I was gonna get my A\nlevels move to a new town and ghost these bitches. But I took a gap year first\nto earn some money which was very boring sitting at home and working at ASDA\nwhere I was not happy to help. My shift started at 5 a.m. on a Saturday. Signed\nup for a Twitter account to run my mouth off and then bam. \u201cSo my name is [Dan].\u201d\nMy YouTube story begins, a new chapter of my life to redefine. So you know what\nI do? Get a Formspring because nothing gives you that attention feeling like\none of those anonymous question and answer websites that are inherently toxic\nand no one should use. And straight out of the bat bisexual Dan returns. 'Cause\nhey, just like Myspace, I\u2019m only telling a few people on the internet right\nnow. It\u2019s not like one day I\u2019m gonna get so many followers that random\nstrangers and my family might see it. Wow, I had a lot fun with many different\nkinds of people in 2009. Let\u2019s just say I got a lot out of my system. Got a\ncouple of things in my system, too. Sorry.</p><p>And this is when, through the magic of the internet, I met Phil. And\nobviously we were more than friends but it was more than just romantic. This is\nsomeone that genuinely liked me. I trusted them. And for the first time since I\nwas a tiny child, I actually felt safe. And the relationship we formed at that\npoint was something that I needed in my life. We are real best friends,\ncompanions through life, like actual soulmates, not that souls are a real thing\nthat exist. It\u2019s so lucky to just find someone you can be that compatible with and\nespecially to anyone that has experienced the kind of self-hatred that I have\ndealt with, one person accepting you can make all the difference. And I bet so\nmany people wanna know so much more about that which, honestly, I take as a\ncompliment. But here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m somebody that wants to keep the details\nof my personal life private. So is Phil. I know lots of people these days,\nthanks to social media, want to share and monetize every aspect of their life\nand then as soon as something changes suddenly it\u2019s this huge drama because\neverybody got invested in the story of your life like it\u2019s a soap opera. I\ndon\u2019t want that. I wanna do certain things without an audience. I wanna be\nspontaneous. I don\u2019t wanna feel afraid to take risks. I want to enjoy totally\nfucking something up and not have to post a statement about it. And if anyone\nthinks people really have to share these things about their life, you need to\nrethink your position. And look, I understand that sex is a fun and interesting\nthing to talk about. I get it. I am also a disgusting pervert. But the specific\nminutiae of who I be fuckin\u2019, when, why, where, how long, how, uhh, I mean? Sexuality is a general\nfact that it can be very useful to know about a person for several reasons, but\nwe can\u2019t force people to disclose that either. We don\u2019t know this person\u2019s life\nstory, what they\u2019ve been through, if they haven\u2019t told people, if they\u2019ll lose\ntheir job, if they\u2019re in danger. There are so many reasons someone might not be\nopen about it. We can preach the message that being out is good, but\naggressively speculating or trying to out someone is really bad. They might not\nbe gay, in which case we\u2019re just harassing someone and probably stereotyping. And\nif they are there\u2019s gonna be a reason why they haven\u2019t talked about it. So I don\u2019t\nwanna see any responses to me finally talking about this like no one is\nsurprised. \u201cDan we been knew.\u201d Wow, you huge galaxy brain genius. What\u2019s it\nlike walking around with all those brain cells in there working overtime? What,\nyou got like three in there? Don\u2019t lose your balance, mastermind. I haven\u2019t\nexactly been subtle have I? I\u2019m an awkward, sexually ambiguous nerd. \u201cWhat the\nfuck even is your sexuality?\u201d That\u2019s not the point. I\u2019m already dead inside so\nit doesn\u2019t matter here, but to me if someone\u2019s reaction to a person coming out is\njust, \u201cyeah, I knew\u201d, they\u2019re showing no empathy towards the issue or\nthat person. They\u2019re just making it about themselves like it was a fun piece of\ngossip they already knew. All we have to\ndo is listen and be accepting.</p><p>So anyway back to the tale. Whilst things were looking up for Dan aged\n18, things quickly got messy again. Wow, that beats the emo streak of temporary\nself-acceptance by like six months, nice. There was a point around 2011 where the\nrelationship with my audience shifted from what felt like direct communication\nbetween me and individuals that just saw me as a comedy creator to communities\nof people that formed to talk about me when I wasn\u2019t there. Which is fine, but\nfor some people it was about getting generally invested in me and my real life\nwhich I thought was a bit strange 'cause inevitably like anyone who puts\nthemself out there, some people started to really dig into my private life to\nfind out information about me that I wasn\u2019t ready to share. And this was around\nthe same time that YouTubers finally started to get mainstream recognition in\nthe British press. We had the BBC knocking at our door trying to offer Dan and\nPhil a radio show. From that, Dan and Phil became this entertainment duo that\nwe could have a creative career with. And we love working together, so when all\nthese opportunities came for Dan and Phil, we were really excited but I was\nalso scared as people clearly knew I wasn\u2019t straight and I hadn\u2019t told my\nfamily that. None of my old friends knew about this, and what me and Phil had\nwas ours and personal and yet some people were trying to get access to it for\ntheir own satisfaction. It was no longer a few people on the internet, no big\ndeal. So I just shut down. It felt like I was back at school again, surrounded\nby threatening people trying to expose me for their entertainment. Most I\u2019m\nsure just wanted what was best for me and I feel such genuine sadness and am\nsorry that I couldn\u2019t be closer to and more truthful with the people in my life\nthat were just trying to be nice but I wasn\u2019t ready to deal with it at this\ntime so I had to do something to contain it. I definitely sent some mixed\nmessages. Some were just joking around, others were super defensive that in my\npanic came across like \u201cI\u2019m now telling everyone I\u2019m totally straight\u201d when all\nI really meant was \u201cplease fuck off and don\u2019t invade my privacy, you creepy\nstalkers, thank you\u201d. But this experience seriously triggered some PTSD in me and\nI was back in the dark place. I didn\u2019t want to just disappear from the internet\nto escape it and throw away this creative hobby that actually started paying\nrent. Thanks. So I just decided to put anything to do with my sexuality in a\nbox to come back to later as I was still processing my past and I wanted to\nunderstand my identity on my own terms and timeline and not just have it\nhijacked as fuel for people\u2019s sexual fantasies or some headline in an article. And\nwhilst we\u2019re not exactly living in a utopia yet here on YouTube, the general\ninternet culture only five or six years ago was a much less wholesome,\nprogressive place as this little bubble is now. Sure, a lot of people probably\nwould have been supportive, but there was just as much open bigotry and general\ntoxicity 'cause people felt less accountable and it was okay to say certain\nthings 'cause it\u2019s just on the internet and I couldn\u2019t handle that at the time.\nAnd, generally, I can handle a\nlot. I have big hands with a very wide reach for playing piano, you fucking..\nget your mind out of the gutter. We can\u2019t ask people to just put their lives on\nhold to address their sexuality first. If a kid dreams of being a footballer\nand age 18 gets signed to a club and all their dreams come true but they\u2019re\nscared to come out because of the insane homophobia in that community, they\nshouldn\u2019t turn it down. Yes, it\u2019s so important to be truthful about who you are\nand open and proud in front of the world but it\u2019s our society\u2019s fault that\nthese people are scared to say who they are. So let\u2019s all focus on making it a\nwelcoming place and people will come out when they are ready. So when was I\nready? Well, it\u2019s always been on my mind that I need to talk about this at some\npoint. I couldn\u2019t just keep going forward in my life ignoring it, not only just\nso I can be authentic, which is very important for general existing, but also\njust letting people know what kind of sexual attention I want from the world. All\nof it from everyone. God I\u2019m so thirsty. And if anything motivated me, it\u2019s the\nidea that I can help someone else 'cause that\u2019s basically my whole career,\nisn\u2019t it, admitting to shit that I\u2019ve been through so you will feel better\nabout yourselves. There we go, you\u2019re welcome. I have a platform and a following\nof millions of people, many of whom I know have been through exactly what I\nhave. And if I tell my story as painful and flip floppy and flawed as it is, I\nknow it mean something to someone as every time someone speaks openly about\nsexuality, it saves lives. I\u2019d never met a single out gay person until I was\n18. And if I had, or even just seen better representation in the media, I\nwouldn\u2019t have felt so totally alone. I wouldn\u2019t even be saying this to you now\nif it wasn\u2019t for TV shows, musicians, and public figures in the last couple\nyears reinforcing this to me. It doesn\u2019t matter if I was living the life\nprivately as there was still so much confusion about my feelings and fear. But\nthings are better now, on the internet, on TV, in my real life. It\u2019s not\nperfect but it feels safe enough in this space right now for me to feel\nconfident. So thank you, sincerely, to all the brave people that came before me\nand to any of you that made this world seem welcoming for me. And instead of\nprocrastinating from this by focusing on work, which was a way for me to insure\nmy own independence and survival in case I was rejected, or just doing things for\nother people to take my mind off it instead of asserting my own needs, which my\ntherapist keeps telling me is one of my biggest problems. Here I am with a\nfresh void of time in front of me to fuck up however I want. Now look, we all\nhave different experiences in life. Some of us are lucky, some of us not. It\njust so happened that the first 18 years of my life were horrendously shit. It\nfailed me. But we get dealt cards from the start, too. If you look at my life,\nI was born into this world as an able-bodied, white, cis-man in Britain which\nimmediately gives me so much privilege in this current world and I am fully\naware of how much harder making it to today could have been for me, which is\nwhy we all need to stand up for equality and social justice even if it doesn\u2019t\napply to us. No one stood up for me when it mattered the most and that almost\ncost me everything. So if you see a woman being harassed, a gay being\nthreatened, someone muttering something racist, say something, do something because\nif you\u2019re still or silent, the victim will just think that you are against\nthem, too. We all have a responsibility.</p><p>This tale was just some of the stuff relating to sexuality. We all have\na whole sob story if we wanna tell it but I just wanted to explain the journey of\nhow I got to this point and overcame the obstacles that tried to block this\npath. And now I\u2019ve arrived.</p><p>Chapter 4 \u2013 Labels</p><p>Okay cool story, bro, it\u2019s answer time. What\u2019s your answer. Whaddayalikedafuk?\nHere\u2019s the thing, you want me to talk candidly about sexuality as if it\u2019s something\nthat I understand? I don\u2019t know what it is, why it is. Turns out no one knows. I\u2019ve\nbeen sitting here for years waiting for scientists to just work it out like\nbleep bloop. [Oh this is why and exactly how it\u2019s different for people. There\nwe go.] Thinking I shouldn\u2019t run off my mouth on the internet in case my\ntheories and opinions on varying gayness get debunked next week. Well, I waited\nlong enough and it didn\u2019t happen. Science, ya fucked up, you let me down. And I\nfully expect to have to delete this video in two weeks when you find out all\nthe answers suddenly. Thanks a bunch. What makes someone gay or straight or all\nthe things in between? What the ever loving fuck is gender about? This is a\nmess. Yet people want you to give them a word because that\u2019s how humans\ncommunicate with words that have meanings. Which is why our disgusting species\nis impatient, stupid, and obsessed with labels. And this applies to everything,\nsexuality, gender, political identity, what obscure genre of synthwave you\nlisten to. People just want a label that represents something they understand\nso they already know how to feel about you and don\u2019t have to bother thinking. [Oh\nyou\u2019re a feminist well I don\u2019t need to know anything more. Oh you\u2019re a leftist.\nOh you\u2019re a K-pop fan but but but but.] If people just want to find a way to\ndisagree with you or dislike you, they can refer to the label and turn off\ntheir brains. Hey, what does my label say? Huh. The issue is, especially when\nwe start talking about the writhing mass of confusion and suffering that is\nsexual and gender identity, the limits of language and specific terminology\nbecome a big problem. What does being gay mean? You never thought about a boob\nonce? What does being a man mean? You wanna be an emotionless rock rubbing raw\nsteaks against your biceps? It\u2019s not like humanity is all in agreement right\nnow. I don\u2019t like the stereotypes and drama that come with all this terminology\nso I\u2019m just not gonna use it. Thing is gender identity isn\u2019t my issue. I feel\ncomfortable with the identity that I\u2019ve had my whole life. Dan, a tol boy from\nEngland. But being a man means nothing to me. I wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable\nwearing makeup or a sickening pair of heels, though I can\u2019t even draw in a\nstraight line so that would be a disaster. Also is anyone really comfortable\nwearing heels? Hmm. Icons of masculinity aren\u2019t really a big part of my life.\nMight as well call me a fucking formless blob that sounds more relatable. Shout\nout to all my formless blobs out there, rise up. I don\u2019t have to do anything or\nbe anything and I personally wouldn\u2019t feel offended if I wasn\u2019t referred to as\na he. Well, she\u2019s feeling hungry today. Stop fucking judging me, Susan. I\u2019m sad\nand I\u2019m gonna eat this whole damn cake whether you like it or not. But anyone\nthat has this don\u2019t really care attitude about their gender identity is in a\nway privileged 'cause some people, especially trans, care a lot about their\ngender identity and using the correct pronouns which other people should\nrespect. Likewise with sexuality, whilst to me the endlessly increasing list of\ntribes and flags being flown is a bit daunting and confusing and personally stresses\nme out 'cause I almost find it constrictive, some people like it. Because if\nyou\u2019re feelings are confusing and then you look at a word that represents\nsomething and go, \u201cwow, that me\u201d, it can help you realize you\u2019re valid and find\na community and that\u2019s great. There is so much controversy around this issue\nand others but if we all just calm down, respect each other\u2019s experiences and\ntry to just be nice, reasonable people, which is a lot to ask, let\u2019s be real,\nit\u2019s quite simple. If you wanna use language to express your honest feelings\nand identity, that\u2019s great and other people should respect what you say.\nLikewise, if you hate labels and you just wanna be a formless blob, that\u2019s\nfine, too. No one should force you. The only thing that isn\u2019t cool is telling\nother people what they should or should not identify as 'cause that ain\u2019t your problem\nor your business, bye. This was one of the things that held me back from\ntalking about this for years. Shit\u2019s confusing, man. Let\u2019s just go back to\ncellular reproduction by mytosis so I don\u2019t really have to be specific. Two\npeople that I really look up to and respect, Harry Styles and Janelle Monae, both\nfamously say that they don\u2019t feel the need to label it which, to be honest, is\nhow I feel and is perfectly okay. But I get it, for me, you want a word. Oh,\nthat\u2019s hard, though. I\u2019m an annoying guy. I feel uncertain specifying my\nsexuality in the same way I wouldn\u2019t say I am an atheist. Who the fuck am I to\nsay whether God does or doesn\u2019t exist? I don\u2019t know shit 'bout shit and neither\ndoes anyone else. I mean I think it\u2019s unlikely in the same way I know I like DICK.\nBut I\u2019m not gonna pretend to have a definite answer here. Looking at my public\nstatements is inconsistent and confusing. Looking at my personal track record\nthrough life is super confusing. And looking at the void inside my soul\nthreatening to crush the entire universe with the force of its event horizon of\nmisery and melodrama, well, fuck let\u2019s close that shit up. One thing\u2019s for sure\nwhatever heterosexual is, I ain\u2019t it. Really if you ask me, I don\u2019t think\nanyone\u2019s totally straight. I think there\u2019s a lot of social and emotional issues\ngetting in the way of yet to be understood feelings of attraction that can be\nvery flexible. And trust me, I\u2019ve known a lot of straight guys until a couple\nof drinks, some deep conversation, and lingering eye contact, and suddenly they\njust start leaning in. What does that make them? And am I totally gay? No. Am I\nslightly more gay or is it just easier for gays to hook up with each other\nbecause of societal norms. It\u2019s not like the signs for male and female\nbathrooms are what I\u2019m attracted to. I don\u2019t care what flesh organ you have\nbetween your legs, what your hair\u2019s like, if you\u2019re covered in it or a fuckin\u2019\nbeluga whale. I\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019m not picky. I\u2019m easy. So am I bi or pan\nor poly? Well, now we\u2019re just in a clusterfuck of defining language and I\u2019m\nconfused and sad and horny. This is why I personally love the word queer. I\nunderstand that some people don\u2019t as it is a slur but as someone that\u2019s been\nthe target of it several times throughout my life I\u2019m up for some reclamation.\nIt\u2019s like recycling. The definition makes sense because until society is equal\nwith all sexual and gender identifies, it is literally strange from a\nconventional viewpoint plus it\u2019s better than a super long acronym, it\u2019s\ninclusive of everyone and therefore great for formless blobs. There we go, an\nidentity I feel comfortable with. A highly-strung, depressed queer praying for\na giant meteor to hurry up and finally eradicate humanity. LMAO, yeet!</p><p>But to come full circle, I know that even today, deep in my heart the\nword gay scares me because that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been conditioned my whole life. So,\nyou know what? Fuck the literal definition and the scientific definition and\nwhat everyone thinks. I finally have to just confront and accept this.</p><p>I\u2019m gay.</p><p>Oh look, didn\u2019t spontaneously fucking combust. Well, there we go, that\nwas a lot of stress about nothing, wasn\u2019t it? Bloody hell. So yup, I\u2019m here,\nI\u2019m queer, and don\u2019t worry I\u2019m still filled with existential fear.</p><p>WE\u2019RE HERE, WE\u2019RE QUEER WE\u2019RE FILLED WITH EXISTENTIAL FEAR. </p><p>Chapter 5 \u2013 Fear</p><p>Even though I\u2019m at this current place, there is still so much I\u2019m afraid\nof and this has taken months to make because of that. Telling my family was a\nbig fear. I have problems connecting with them emotionally because reasons. So\nI only came out to them this month and if it didn\u2019t go well, as I\u2019m now the\nindependent adult that I fought so hard to be, I was ready to cut them off like\nthe bottom of a sweater turning into a seasonal crop. But I didn\u2019t have to,\nlove you. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d reject me these days but coming out is still a\nsurprise. It changes things. And I\u2019m a pretty awkward person generally but the\nidea of just dropping this in conversation in front of them all terrified me. And\nI tried several times this year to do it but I just couldn\u2019t. So you know how I\nfinally came out to my family? E-mail. Yep, I literally just sent them an e-mail\nsaying and I quote, </p><p>\u201cHello gang. I\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you all for a while,\nsomething quite important that should be disclosed at some point. I thought I\nwould around Christmas, then Mum\u2019s birthday, then last Easter Sunday, etc., but\nevery time I meant to, I either felt like I would ruin the mood of the day or I\njust felt awkward and didn\u2019t want to. So I decided just to email you all\ninstead which is really inappropriate and just weird but that somehow seems\nappropriate for me and at least I\u2019ll just finally say it. </p><p>Basically I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><p>Yup. It was just getting ridiculous so I thought screw it and hey, it\nworked. Turns out my remaining family, pretty chill bunch of people. Even my\nChristian grandma said this,</p><p>\u201cWe love you for being you. It must be a great relief to finally acknowledge\nwho you are. Popsie and I just want you to be happy. People are born as they\nare and have no say in it. I hope that now you will feel free to live your life\nas you want with no pretense.\u201d</p><p>Aw.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the iPad.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I said I\u2019d give her my old iPad. She mainly cares about that I\nthing. Wasn\u2019t so sure when I was 17 but it went well now and I know that makes\nme lucky but, hey, it shows that times change. As for the other people in my\nlife, obviously all the friends I have now are cool. If anyone in my life I\u2019ve\never known isn\u2019t cool with it then I don\u2019t care. And sure here online there\nmight be a few incredibly lost bigots following me or just some classic trolls\nwho I think should get fucked. No, like literally, I think you should try it.\nYou\u2019ll probably enjoy it and you might learn something about yourself. Inevitably\nsome of you watching this might have a weird reaction if you just feel like it\nwas a shock or you feel hurt that I kept it from you. But I feel like I\nexplained myself reasonably here and going forward I can\u2019t have any space for\nthat, sorry. I\u2019ve come to terms with who I am and now you have to, too, ha. Funnily\nenough straight up homophobia is probably the one thing I\u2019m not that afraid of,\nbecause I just don\u2019t agree so it doesn\u2019t hold much emotional power over me but\nyou bet I\u2019m opening myself up to all new kinds of in real life and international\ndiscrimination now which is fun. But one of the other big fears holding me back\nwas, honestly, that I wouldn\u2019t be accepted by the community. I know that it\u2019s a\nbig pride flag covering a lot of ground and even the idea of it and certainly\nmost of it is amazing. But there is a lot of drama within it right now\nespecially on the internet. You\u2019ve got Grindr gays arguing about how manly gays\nshould be, bi\u2019s getting ignored, trans people, especially of color, not being\nhistorically appreciated, acephobia, fucking SWERFs and TERFs. No thank you. So\neven though they my people, I know some of them will have problems with\nsomething. And even then, just seeing such a loud and proud, strong and\nopinionated group of people celebrating something just intimidates a smol\nintrovert such as myself. And in my mind if these people don\u2019t accept me because\nI\u2019m not being definitive enough or I took too long then I almost feel like I\u2019ll\nbe alone all over again, and this is a fear that a lot of people have honestly.\nBut I\u2019m a nice guy and I\u2019m trying my best so you better be welcoming, you bunch\nof fuckin\u2019 queers. And obviously with the topic of sexuality, it doesn\u2019t matter\nwhere we are or how far you think we\u2019ve come, by merely mentioning it, I will\nbe opening up a primordial box of bullshit which will include every single\nstupid argument and question since the dawn of time. [It\u2019s not natural.]\nThere\u2019s gay animals. [Adam and Steve.] That\u2019s based on a story and the\nprotagonist that arrives later probably doesn\u2019t agree with you. [Why can\u2019t we\nhave straight pride?] I could spend 10 hours on all the classic crap and people\nwould still be asking the same things. This being posted on the internet, my\nhopes are so incredibly low, lower than my self-esteem. \u00a0Wow, that is unhealthy. I need to stop doing\nthat. This video is about internalized oppression and the problems of language.\nI\u2019m not here to pontificate on every topic tangentially related to the entire\nconcept of gayness. *ASMR voice*: Pontificate on every topic tangentially\nrelated to the concept of gayness. \u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s other humans and all the time in the world left for that. The\ntime in the world coincidentally being not much longer. Climate change LMAO.\nBut I had to tell my story so people would understand me and these things. Why\ncoming out is still a big deal because queer people are often invisible and\nsuffering until they have to do it. Some people grow up in supportive\nenvironments and it\u2019s a positive experience. But more likely, especially around\nthe world outside of the big cities, it isn\u2019t. This is not a fight that is\nanywhere near over. Even in Britain today people are debating whether children\nshould be taught to be accepting of sexual and gender identity in school. </p><p>Queer people exist. Choosing not to accept them is not an option. </p><p>To anyone watching this that isn\u2019t out, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay. You were\nborn this way, it\u2019s right, and anyone that has a problem with it is wrong.\nBased on your circumstance, you might not feel ready to tell people yet or that\nit\u2019s safe and that\u2019s fine, too. Just know that living your truth, with pride,\nis the way to be happy. You are valid. It gets so much better. And the future\nis clear. It\u2019s pretty\nqueer. </p><p>So there we go. Now I can proceed authentically in my life with full\ndisclosure. Cute mutuals know to slide into the DMs. And you can all fuck off\nand leave me alone.</p><p>Bye.</p>",

Secrecy! And a whole lot of internal screaming. Starring Daniel\nHowell. One of the greatest mysteries of our generation. What is Dan&rsquo;s\nsexuality?&raquo;</p><p>Spoiler alert. I&rsquo;m not straight. Sex, the foundation of life and the\nonly thing we&rsquo;re really supposed to do. Everyone&rsquo;s obsessed with it. You bunch\nof degenerates. In the list of things that identify a person, one of the most\nimportant for other people to know is their sexuality. For, if sex is the\nprimal force propelling all of these humans forward by their hips, they have to\nknow. Are we gonna fuck? Or like could we? Or are you, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m just\nwondering. Now, we live in a heteronormative world, which is a long scary word\nthat makes people feel attacked for some reason. Shh it&rsquo;s okay.\n\n</p><p>What it means is people are presumed to be straight. If you&rsquo;re not, then\nat some point, you have to &ldquo;come out&rdquo;, which is a whole thing. Or people might\njust try and guess based on something you do or the way you act, because yay\nstereotypes. So this is something you have to be clear on, because if you&rsquo;re\nnot, how are all these other people that aren&rsquo;t you going to cope? But I&rsquo;m\npretty sure no one that knows me thinks I&rsquo;m straight. So I don&rsquo;t really need to\ncome out as much as just clarify what the hell is going on. As here I am at age\n27 and my sexual preference is seemingly still a vague, debatable, confusing,\nimpenetrable mystery. But why? And what is it? Well, those are some big\nquestions. Are you sure you wanna know my answers?</p><p>[YES]</p><p>Okay, well, if you say so &lsquo;cause this is a complicated and sensitive\nissue and when it comes to me, boy, there is a lot to unpack here and it is a\ntotal clusterfuck. So strap yourselves in and let me tell you a queer little\nstory about a boy named Dan.</p><p>Chapter 1 &ndash; The Word</p><p>&#9834; When I was a young boy &#9834;</p><p>&#9834; My father &#9834;</p><p>Didn&rsquo;t have much time for me because my conception was clearly an\naccident and he was a narcissistic proud man suddenly inconvenienced in the\nprime of his life and this emotional neglect gave me lasting problems. </p><p>Sorry that&rsquo;s not all relevant right now.</p><p>I was an only child for seven years and with working parents. This meant\nI had to make my own fun so I was imaginative &nbsp;and loud which is something that my teachers used\nto say quite a lot followed by, &ldquo;However.&rdquo; Here I am age five. Look\nat me. Cute, poised, sassy, turning out this photo shoot like sorry, Grandma, I\nstunted on this set. Are you seeing this? In almost every way, I literally\npeaked age five. I loved being the center of attention. People said I had an\ninfectious happiness, that my beaming smile brought them hope and joy. People\nthat know me are laughing right now. But a boy, in the '90s being happy and\ngenerally polite acting? Sounds kinda GAY if you ask me. Literally, masculinity\nwas so fragile, people were so proud and scared and society so aggressive that\na boy smiling!?.. appearing to be empathetic or in any way emoting was seen as\na threat. How dare they laugh and feel comfortable? They must be soft and weak\nand girly and GAY. So basically thanks, Grandma, for raising me to be a nice\nchild, you dick. Just kidding. That&rsquo;s a joke and I told you not to watch this\nvideo because it would be rude so if you send me a disappointed text telling me\nyou&rsquo;re offended, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you. Although, now I think about it,\nyou did make me go to church for 10 years, which in hindsight probably also\ndidn&rsquo;t help &#9834; Hallelujah &#9834; the issue here so. But then it was time for little\nDan to go to school and this is when it &nbsp;</p><p> &#9834; All went wrong &#9834;</p><p>'Cause it turns out most children, evil pieces of shit. Doesn&rsquo;t matter\nif you try to raise a happy innocent child, throw that kid into school, aka, a\nliteral Mad Max Battle Royale with the feral offspring of your local community.\nYeah, that crap&rsquo;ll be undone in about two weeks. I was six years old running\naround the playground pretending to be Sonic the Hedgehog or something when two\nbrothers come up to me aged seven and eight with an unexplained aggressive look\nin their eye. And the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach,\nand just says, &ldquo;GAY.&rdquo;</p><p>This was the first time I ever heard that word. Well, I don&rsquo;t know what\nthe heck gay means but apparently it means people kick you on the floor so that\nain&rsquo;t good. I didn&rsquo;t know this child or give them any cause to have an opinion\non me. And, actually, I never directly interacted with them again. What epic clustershit\nof failed parenting and general culture brought this tiny child to get angry and\nattack someone, then call them gay for looking like they were having fun\noutside. Are you okay, 1990s? And so my relationship with sexuality began. </p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t looking to define myself as a child indiscriminately playing\ndoctors and nurses with various friends until once somebody&rsquo;s mum walked into a\nroom to find three fully naked children sat on a bed sticking sellotape to each\nother&rsquo;s butts. Yep, which I don&rsquo;t recommend. Also, Jesus Christ, the poor woman\nthat saw that. Then you get to the magic age around 10 or 11 where everybody\nsuddenly wants to pretend they&rsquo;re totally a &ldquo;cool teenager&rdquo; who&rsquo;s doing all the\ndrugs and the sex and the fights, totally. Boy, gay was a really popular word\nback then. </p><p> [[Boy] Uh, homework is gay. [Girl]\nUh, my mum&rsquo;s so gay. [Boy] Uh, you touched a girl, gay.]</p><p>This one little shit who I won&rsquo;t name was one of the school bullies and\nhe loved the word gay. He had it in for me and I have no idea why. You know me,\nMr. Winnie the Pooh Meets Slender Man. Well, when I was 10 just Winnie the\nPooh. I didn&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; to no one ever and yet this guy used my pacifism as a\npunching bag where any group situation was an excuse to single me out call me\ngay for some reason and then make everyone else exclude me because they were\nscared of him. I had a girlfriend. We dated for six whole weeks. We kissed in a\ngame of spin the bottle once by literally sucking on each other&rsquo;s faces. Then\nshe ended dumping me over speakerphone at a birthday party that everyone in my\nclass but me was invited to but, hey. I don&rsquo;t know what I was doing wrong, but\nat this age, I understood one thing. Being gay, whatever that meant, was clearly\nthe worst thing you could be. On a Darwinian level, I was being told, okay\nbitch, &ldquo;Survival Code&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t be this apparently. Evolution. Plot\ntwist, this bully I think he was a bit gay because once he asked me to have a\nsleepover at his house and I thought was me finally getting socially accepted only\nfor him in the middle of the night to come up and ask me, &ldquo;So who&rsquo;s going\nto be the boy and the girl?&rdquo; I was an innocent smol bean who didn&rsquo;t really\nunderstand what he meant because, to be honest, I didn&rsquo;t actually understand\nget how babies were made yet. But needless to say I think he was disappointed.\nWow, closeted child turns into homophobic bully. Thanks again society. But this\nwhole primary school journey was really just an amuse-bouche for the full\nsix-course tasting menu of suffering that would be secondary school.</p><p>I went to an all-boys school. It was a literal hellscape. &nbsp;I thought it was hard making it through a\nschool of 200 kids with two or three bullies. Try over a thousand where a clean\n800 are fully psychopathic gorillas fueled by testosterone, Red Bull, and\nEminem albums. Making sure that the word f- no longer means an innocent bundle\nof sticks or a cigarette anymore in the British lexicon. Nope, now it was a\ncool homophobic slur along with gay, gaylord, gayboy, puff, pufter, ponce, batty,\nbatty boy, bum-boy, bender. Shit, this is so long. People have a lot of words\nfor something they don&rsquo;t wanna think about. Look at me in this stupid blazer. Oh,\n&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll grow into it at some point in the next four years&rdquo;. Thanks,\nMum. Day one, kid in form class, some stupid hedgehog-looking motherfucker side\neyes me and says, &ldquo;What you lookin at, puff?&rdquo; First interaction at a new\nschool. Great! My entire existence on a daily basis then becomes navigating\nthis school like I&rsquo;m in the bloody &ldquo;Maze Runner&rdquo; trying to avoid\naggressive pricks with chode ties. And you know being verbally abused for being\na nerd or a Greebo at least felt relevant to me at the time. Greebo, definitely\none of my faves there and I&rsquo;m sure that Korn and Slipknot would have been proud\nto have 12-year-old me as a fan. I kinda knew who I was in the hierarchy at\nthat point. I was essentially a theater kid who spent all of his free time\nplaying Runescape on the AOL browser on his mum&rsquo;s PC instead of football. I\naccepted it. But at least I wasn&rsquo;t actually this &ldquo;gay thing&rdquo; people kept\nthrowing around because by now I understood a gay is a boy who fancies other\nboys. And to be honest I don&rsquo;t really feel like I&rsquo;ve ever fancied anyone\nbefore.</p><p>Then puberty happened.</p><p>Oh yeah, this is fun, tingly feelings, I smell bad. It was quite fun\ndribbling on this girl&rsquo;s face playing Truth or Dare, maybe later we&rsquo;ll go behind\nthat bike sheds and, there I was sat in English class, my friend next to me. I\nwatched as he delicately removes a pencil from its case. We briefly make eye\ncontact as he flutters his long black eyelashes with a blink before staring\nforward. His eyes are so bright and beautiful yet they seem so sad and deep\nwith emotion. I wish I could just understand. Oh fuck, I think I&rsquo;m a bit gay. You&rsquo;re\ntelling me this whole time I actually have been the bad thing that people keep\ncalling me? Shit!</p><p>Chapter 2 &ndash; Feelings</p><p>Oh do you hear it that faint hum, something coming from a deep, dark\nplace too powerful to control? It&rsquo;s the self-hatred. She is here and she&rsquo;s only\ngetting started. Short version, I fall hopelessly in love with a friend of mine\nwho doesn&rsquo;t feel the same way which crushes me into a million tiny pieces and\nyears later actually it turns out he was gay the whole time. He just really\nspecifically didn&rsquo;t like <i>me</i>. [Double\nkill.] Here I am, 13, crying to evanescence alone in my bedroom feeling like\nthere&rsquo;s no point in really being alive as I&rsquo;m clearly a faulty outcast person that\nhas no place in the world. I stopped going to church with my grandma because I\nfelt like I wasn&rsquo;t really supposed to be there. Also, by this age, the whole\nChristianity thing didn&rsquo;t really make much sense to me. And the adult services\nwere dry AF compared to coloring in a picture of Jesus&rsquo;s face at Sunday school.\nSo other than the free tea and biscuits they gave away after the sermon, religion\ndidn&rsquo;t really have much to offer me. Damn, there was some good biscuits though.\nI miss that. But wait! All is not lost yet. Do you see that? A triumphant,\nrallying cry of guitars, stripey hoodies, and black hair dye. Emo had arrived! I\nswear to God, emo is one of the best things that happened to pop culture in the\nlast 20 years. As well as inventing eyeliner and skinny jeans, a new word hit the\ntheater, nerd, goth, band, kid corner that would change my world forever.</p><p>Bisexual. You can be normal and gay at the same time and some people\nthink it&rsquo;s cool? Well, slap a long fingerless glove on my arm and sign me up to\nMyspace 'cause Mum, I&rsquo;m bi. It was a good term 'cause it was a catchall for\nanyone who felt sexually confused or curious that didn&rsquo;t want to commit to\nsomething stronger which is very me. Big commitment issues. Thanks, fam. To be\nclear, regardless of whatever the 2006 teenagers thoughts and feelings were, being\nbi is valid and should not be excused away or erased by anyone. Thank you.</p><p>From this moment, I was a loud and proud raving bi to my close friends\nand the strangers on the internet who saw my clearly-labeled sexual preference on\nmy Myspace page. And the emo friends I made at this time were awesome. We just\nused to hang and make out with each other and listen to music and drink bottles\nof Smirnoff Ice until we were sick on each other with no judgment. The judgment\ncame several years later looking back at the photos that you can&rsquo;t delete. So I\ndidn&rsquo;t need to tell my family or people at school anything. But the thing is\nwith a Myspace page, anyone with an internet connection can read it. And so the\nrumors started spreading through my neighborhood that Dan Howell was in fact a\nbisexual. I had a friend in French class who one day, totally unprompted, just turned\nto me and said, &ldquo;Hmm, yeah, I thought so. You give off a bi-vibe.&rdquo; A\nbi-vi-, what the fuck is a bi-vibe? Great, yeah, nothing to make a 15-year-old feel\nself-conscious about his behavior like being told he emanates a bisexual aura. What\nam I supposed to do with that? Sorry that I give off mixed signals. I&rsquo;m\nversatile. Turns out it was actually a social upgrade from being called gay all\nthe time 'cause bisexual was a new word that only referred to sexuality so\npeople actually had to decide how they felt about the fact I was attracted to\nboys. As opposed to gay which as we all understood is synonymous with bad and\nalso implies a general threat, plague, curse/evil force that simply must be\ndestroyed. People at school were actually almost nice to me with curiosity\nabout it and a few of the boys that previously loved to just generically call\nme gay while throwing a compasses at me or something, now started to low key\nflirt with me and some stuff happened. Go figure.</p><p>But then I entered the dark ages and no I&rsquo;m not talking about my hair because\nI was never actually cool enough to commit to dying it black. As quickly as\nthey arrived into my life, my emo friend group vanished into the night. Like\nthe tip of an eyeliner pencil snapping or the HTML on your intricately-crafted\nMySpace page falling apart when the host websites of your embedded gifs die, so,\ntoo, did my social life. One had to suddenly focus on school, another moved\ntown, two of them just fell out with each other and started hanging out with\ntheir old friends again. Well, we don&rsquo;t all have back up friend groups, Lindsey!\nI went all in on the emos! You&rsquo;re telling me I have to go back to sitting in my\nkitchen playing Runescape now! Thanks a lot. So for a year I literally had no\nfriends. And this is when the bullying at school really stepped its pussy up. The\nthings people used to say offhand to me in a corridor were now said loudly in\nclassrooms where everybody would laugh. People used to sing songs about me\nbeing gay on the bus while my fellow nerds sat around me just stared awkwardly\nout of the window not wanting to get involved. They shouted things out during\nGCSE exams in front of the whole school and the low key pushing became punches.\nPeople used to wait for me after school just to throw things at me. Once a guy\nput his hand around my throat and pushed my head against a coat peg in the\nlocker room while everyone was watching and just slapped me for five minutes. But\nI never reacted. I never cried or got angry or fought back 'cause then I&rsquo;d be\ngiving them what they wanted and I refused to play along. But this way of\ndealing with things definitely had an impact on my relationship with emotion\ngoing into life. I became a total outcast. No one wanted to come near me out of\nfear that they&rsquo;d get targeted, too. So no one ever stood up for me. And, you\nknow, I don&rsquo;t blame them. I just resent them even to this day. No, I&rsquo;m kidding,\nI don&rsquo;t really. I do. No, I don&rsquo;t. I, hmm. Teachers at the time obviously did\nnothing. In fact, one of them saw this\nhappening to me and laughed 'cause you know, boys will be boys especially\nthe gay ones that get killed by the other ones, am I right? Ah, classic lad\nbanter. And home. See, keeping this on the topic of sexuality and not economic\nclass, violence, addiction, and health issues, let&rsquo;s just say some shit was\ngoin&rsquo; down. I didn&rsquo;t think I could ask my family for help or share my feelings\nabout this, mainly due to my dad. Funny guy, kind of a woke hippie who did and\nsaid a lot of things I did respect but at the same time used to walk around the\nhouse saying how he hoped someone he had a problem with at work would *clears\nthroat* &ldquo;die of bum cancer.&rdquo; Yep, so picked the one area to be a\nbigot that would further traumatize your child. Nice! This experience coming\nfrom a childhood hearing the word gay meaninglessly thrown around as an insult\nat home and school, in music, on TV, to then realizing I am actually kinda gay,\nto then very specifically being attacked for it was traumatic. The world was\nclearly telling me if I ever wanted to be accepted by anyone or, in my\nparticular environment, survive, I couldn&rsquo;t be gay. I was afraid of it, literally\nhomophobic of myself. I am talking Pavlov, sunken place, North Korea-level mind\nalteration that made me terrified of and repulsed by this part of me. This is called\ninternalized oppression. It&rsquo;s a real thing and it&rsquo;s some real shit. </p><p>Chapter 3 &ndash; Internalized Oppression</p><p>From this moment I was no longer advertising myself as bi. No, BRB deleting\nthat Myspace real quick, xD lemme get on that Bebo. &ldquo;My Chemical\nRomance&rdquo;? No, I&rsquo;m listen to what&rsquo;s this, N-Dubz? Jesus Christ. I go away\nfor the summer break and come back to school quiet and serious and fully\nstraight. *coughs* I needed me some new friends that were a bit higher up the\nsocial ladder, you know what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo; for security so I go ahead and join\n&ldquo;The Inbetweeners&rdquo;. Literally this group of friends, the exact middle\nground between nerds and desperately wanting to be cool. And oh how desperate\nwe were. The great thing about these friends was they knew loads of girls. So\nfirstly, instant cool points. Secondly, if I date a girl *scoffs* super not\ngay. The problem with that was it&rsquo;s not like everyone just forgot everything\nthat&rsquo;s been said about me and this group of friends, causally homophobic pretty\nmuch all the time and also they hung out in places near some even more\naggressive and super homophobic peeps. Just full-time Runescape would have been\na better in hindsight. I find myself going through the same shit at school but\nnow voluntarily going through it at the weekends from the people that are\nsupposed to be my friends thinking I&rsquo;m doing the right thing whilst constantly\ntelling myself I&rsquo;m now totally heterosexual. So I did what many people choose\nto do at that point and I got a girlfriend. But this is pretty messed up because\nI really liked this girl. In fact, I loved her as a friend and I was genuinely\nattracted to her but I was so afraid of sexuality I didn&rsquo;t even wanna do\nanything straight in case I had some weird gay panic that I was totally frigid\nand I led her on. And when she got pissed at me, understandably, for being a\nterrible boyfriend, I just felt even worse. This was someone who I liked that I\nwas hurting and lying to but I couldn&rsquo;t leave as then I&rsquo;d have no armor.\nBeautiful irony here is having a girlfriend didn&rsquo;t in any way stop the abuse 'cause\nremember, gay is a great all-purpose general insult. (Call someone gay today\nand we&rsquo;ll throw in a free set of steak knives.) And when these neighborhood\nteens started heavy drinking and getting into drugs, things suddenly got as\npeople joked about setting fire to a tent as I slept in it at Reading Festival.\nOr saying, &ldquo;You know that notoriously unstable guy? Yeah, he said he&rsquo;s\ngonna kill you next Saturday.&rdquo; Awkward.</p><p>This was definitely the lowest point in my life. I just felt totally\nalone, confused and I deeply hated myself. I used to ask God, in case he was\nthere, to please, just make me straight and everyone stop. But I saw no end, no\nescape, no way to change the world or who I was. So one evening I thought fuck\nit and I attempted suicide.</p><p>I say attempted, because just before it was too late I thought</p><p>&ldquo;oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit what have i done what have i done\nfuck fuck fuck fuck fuck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;what will your grandma think don&rsquo;t do this to her she tried her\nbest and she loves you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;your family aren&rsquo;t total dicks and this will fuck them up can&rsquo;t\nyou just get over it surely&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re gonna get to the last year of school and give up now really\nwhat was the point&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard this is one of the most painful ways to die so not a great\nchoice if I&rsquo;m being blunt&rdquo;</p><p>Felt kinda bad for a few days otherwise I pretended it never happened\nand I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone, until now, literally. Hmm, I know pretty dark right,\nbut hey spoiler things kinda worked out. I mean still gotta lot of issues but\nhere I am. I&rsquo;m so glad I failed for so many reasons, for the people in my life,\nfor the future I would&rsquo;ve wasted. The most important being that I thought I was\ntrapped in a situation forever when in reality, the entire world I lived in and\nmy life changed completely. I thought it was hopeless when in reality there was\nso much to hope for and that&rsquo;s it. Time\nchanges everything. With the lives that we have, we can try anything we&rsquo;ve\ndreamed of. I want anyone that&rsquo;s ever felt like this to realize you are never\ntrapped. There is always hope. You\njust need to believe in yourself and get to the other side. So yeah school age\n6 to 18, I&rsquo;m gonna give that a bad Google review. The thing is I did stand out.\nI&rsquo;ve always been a loudmouth, class clown, annoying shit. Since graduating, it\nturns out half the people I knew were fuckin&rsquo; gay. That group of friends I had,\nall lovely people now. Five of them were gay, five gays! That is statistically\nirregular. Oh but they flew under the radar. All I&rsquo;m saying is I wish people\njust hated me for being annoying and immature. Leave the gays alone!</p><p>My light at the end of the tunnel was university. I was gonna get my A\nlevels move to a new town and ghost these bitches. But I took a gap year first\nto earn some money which was very boring sitting at home and working at ASDA\nwhere I was not happy to help. My shift started at 5 a.m. on a Saturday. Signed\nup for a Twitter account to run my mouth off and then bam. &ldquo;So my name is [Dan].&rdquo;\nMy YouTube story begins, a new chapter of my life to redefine. So you know what\nI do? Get a Formspring because nothing gives you that attention feeling like\none of those anonymous question and answer websites that are inherently toxic\nand no one should use. And straight out of the bat bisexual Dan returns. 'Cause\nhey, just like Myspace, I&rsquo;m only telling a few people on the internet right\nnow. It&rsquo;s not like one day I&rsquo;m gonna get so many followers that random\nstrangers and my family might see it. Wow, I had a lot fun with many different\nkinds of people in 2009. Let&rsquo;s just say I got a lot out of my system. Got a\ncouple of things in my system, too. Sorry.</p><p>And this is when, through the magic of the internet, I met Phil. And\nobviously we were more than friends but it was more than just romantic. This is\nsomeone that genuinely liked me. I trusted them. And for the first time since I\nwas a tiny child, I actually felt safe. And the relationship we formed at that\npoint was something that I needed in my life. We are real best friends,\ncompanions through life, like actual soulmates, not that souls are a real thing\nthat exist. It&rsquo;s so lucky to just find someone you can be that compatible with and\nespecially to anyone that has experienced the kind of self-hatred that I have\ndealt with, one person accepting you can make all the difference. And I bet so\nmany people wanna know so much more about that which, honestly, I take as a\ncompliment. But here&rsquo;s the thing. I&rsquo;m somebody that wants to keep the details\nof my personal life private. So is Phil. I know lots of people these days,\nthanks to social media, want to share and monetize every aspect of their life\nand then as soon as something changes suddenly it&rsquo;s this huge drama because\neverybody got invested in the story of your life like it&rsquo;s a soap opera. I\ndon&rsquo;t want that. I wanna do certain things without an audience. I wanna be\nspontaneous. I don&rsquo;t wanna feel afraid to take risks. I want to enjoy totally\nfucking something up and not have to post a statement about it. And if anyone\nthinks people really have to share these things about their life, you need to\nrethink your position. And look, I understand that sex is a fun and interesting\nthing to talk about. I get it. I am also a disgusting pervert. But the specific\nminutiae of who I be fuckin&rsquo;, when, why, where, how long, how, uhh, I mean? Sexuality is a general\nfact that it can be very useful to know about a person for several reasons, but\nwe can&rsquo;t force people to disclose that either. We don&rsquo;t know this person&rsquo;s life\nstory, what they&rsquo;ve been through, if they haven&rsquo;t told people, if they&rsquo;ll lose\ntheir job, if they&rsquo;re in danger. There are so many reasons someone might not be\nopen about it. We can preach the message that being out is good, but\naggressively speculating or trying to out someone is really bad. They might not\nbe gay, in which case we&rsquo;re just harassing someone and probably stereotyping. And\nif they are there&rsquo;s gonna be a reason why they haven&rsquo;t talked about it. So I don&rsquo;t\nwanna see any responses to me finally talking about this like no one is\nsurprised. &ldquo;Dan we been knew.&rdquo; Wow, you huge galaxy brain genius. What&rsquo;s it\nlike walking around with all those brain cells in there working overtime? What,\nyou got like three in there? Don&rsquo;t lose your balance, mastermind. I haven&rsquo;t\nexactly been subtle have I? I&rsquo;m an awkward, sexually ambiguous nerd. &ldquo;What the\nfuck even is your sexuality?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not the point. I&rsquo;m already dead inside so\nit doesn&rsquo;t matter here, but to me if someone&rsquo;s reaction to a person coming out is\njust, &ldquo;yeah, I knew&rdquo;, they&rsquo;re showing no empathy towards the issue or\nthat person. They&rsquo;re just making it about themselves like it was a fun piece of\ngossip they already knew. All we have to\ndo is listen and be accepting.</p><p>So anyway back to the tale. Whilst things were looking up for Dan aged\n18, things quickly got messy again. Wow, that beats the emo streak of temporary\nself-acceptance by like six months, nice. There was a point around 2011 where the\nrelationship with my audience shifted from what felt like direct communication\nbetween me and individuals that just saw me as a comedy creator to communities\nof people that formed to talk about me when I wasn&rsquo;t there. Which is fine, but\nfor some people it was about getting generally invested in me and my real life\nwhich I thought was a bit strange 'cause inevitably like anyone who puts\nthemself out there, some people started to really dig into my private life to\nfind out information about me that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to share. And this was around\nthe same time that YouTubers finally started to get mainstream recognition in\nthe British press. We had the BBC knocking at our door trying to offer Dan and\nPhil a radio show. From that, Dan and Phil became this entertainment duo that\nwe could have a creative career with. And we love working together, so when all\nthese opportunities came for Dan and Phil, we were really excited but I was\nalso scared as people clearly knew I wasn&rsquo;t straight and I hadn&rsquo;t told my\nfamily that. None of my old friends knew about this, and what me and Phil had\nwas ours and personal and yet some people were trying to get access to it for\ntheir own satisfaction. It was no longer a few people on the internet, no big\ndeal. So I just shut down. It felt like I was back at school again, surrounded\nby threatening people trying to expose me for their entertainment. Most I&rsquo;m\nsure just wanted what was best for me and I feel such genuine sadness and am\nsorry that I couldn&rsquo;t be closer to and more truthful with the people in my life\nthat were just trying to be nice but I wasn&rsquo;t ready to deal with it at this\ntime so I had to do something to contain it. I definitely sent some mixed\nmessages. Some were just joking around, others were super defensive that in my\npanic came across like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m now telling everyone I&rsquo;m totally straight&rdquo; when all\nI really meant was &ldquo;please fuck off and don&rsquo;t invade my privacy, you creepy\nstalkers, thank you&rdquo;. But this experience seriously triggered some PTSD in me and\nI was back in the dark place. I didn&rsquo;t want to just disappear from the internet\nto escape it and throw away this creative hobby that actually started paying\nrent. Thanks. So I just decided to put anything to do with my sexuality in a\nbox to come back to later as I was still processing my past and I wanted to\nunderstand my identity on my own terms and timeline and not just have it\nhijacked as fuel for people&rsquo;s sexual fantasies or some headline in an article. And\nwhilst we&rsquo;re not exactly living in a utopia yet here on YouTube, the general\ninternet culture only five or six years ago was a much less wholesome,\nprogressive place as this little bubble is now. Sure, a lot of people probably\nwould have been supportive, but there was just as much open bigotry and general\ntoxicity 'cause people felt less accountable and it was okay to say certain\nthings 'cause it&rsquo;s just on the internet and I couldn&rsquo;t handle that at the time.\nAnd, generally, I can handle a\nlot. I have big hands with a very wide reach for playing piano, you fucking..\nget your mind out of the gutter. We can&rsquo;t ask people to just put their lives on\nhold to address their sexuality first. If a kid dreams of being a footballer\nand age 18 gets signed to a club and all their dreams come true but they&rsquo;re\nscared to come out because of the insane homophobia in that community, they\nshouldn&rsquo;t turn it down. Yes, it&rsquo;s so important to be truthful about who you are\nand open and proud in front of the world but it&rsquo;s our society&rsquo;s fault that\nthese people are scared to say who they are. So let&rsquo;s all focus on making it a\nwelcoming place and people will come out when they are ready. So when was I\nready? Well, it&rsquo;s always been on my mind that I need to talk about this at some\npoint. I couldn&rsquo;t just keep going forward in my life ignoring it, not only just\nso I can be authentic, which is very important for general existing, but also\njust letting people know what kind of sexual attention I want from the world. All\nof it from everyone. God I&rsquo;m so thirsty. And if anything motivated me, it&rsquo;s the\nidea that I can help someone else 'cause that&rsquo;s basically my whole career,\nisn&rsquo;t it, admitting to shit that I&rsquo;ve been through so you will feel better\nabout yourselves. There we go, you&rsquo;re welcome. I have a platform and a following\nof millions of people, many of whom I know have been through exactly what I\nhave. And if I tell my story as painful and flip floppy and flawed as it is, I\nknow it mean something to someone as every time someone speaks openly about\nsexuality, it saves lives. I&rsquo;d never met a single out gay person until I was\n18. And if I had, or even just seen better representation in the media, I\nwouldn&rsquo;t have felt so totally alone. I wouldn&rsquo;t even be saying this to you now\nif it wasn&rsquo;t for TV shows, musicians, and public figures in the last couple\nyears reinforcing this to me. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I was living the life\nprivately as there was still so much confusion about my feelings and fear. But\nthings are better now, on the internet, on TV, in my real life. It&rsquo;s not\nperfect but it feels safe enough in this space right now for me to feel\nconfident. So thank you, sincerely, to all the brave people that came before me\nand to any of you that made this world seem welcoming for me. And instead of\nprocrastinating from this by focusing on work, which was a way for me to insure\nmy own independence and survival in case I was rejected, or just doing things for\nother people to take my mind off it instead of asserting my own needs, which my\ntherapist keeps telling me is one of my biggest problems. Here I am with a\nfresh void of time in front of me to fuck up however I want. Now look, we all\nhave different experiences in life. Some of us are lucky, some of us not. It\njust so happened that the first 18 years of my life were horrendously shit. It\nfailed me. But we get dealt cards from the start, too. If you look at my life,\nI was born into this world as an able-bodied, white, cis-man in Britain which\nimmediately gives me so much privilege in this current world and I am fully\naware of how much harder making it to today could have been for me, which is\nwhy we all need to stand up for equality and social justice even if it doesn&rsquo;t\napply to us. No one stood up for me when it mattered the most and that almost\ncost me everything. So if you see a woman being harassed, a gay being\nthreatened, someone muttering something racist, say something, do something because\nif you&rsquo;re still or silent, the victim will just think that you are against\nthem, too. We all have a responsibility.</p><p>This tale was just some of the stuff relating to sexuality. We all have\na whole sob story if we wanna tell it but I just wanted to explain the journey of\nhow I got to this point and overcame the obstacles that tried to block this\npath. And now I&rsquo;ve arrived.</p><p>Chapter 4 &ndash; Labels</p><p>Okay cool story, bro, it&rsquo;s answer time. What&rsquo;s your answer. Whaddayalikedafuk?\nHere&rsquo;s the thing, you want me to talk candidly about sexuality as if it&rsquo;s something\nthat I understand? I don&rsquo;t know what it is, why it is. Turns out no one knows. I&rsquo;ve\nbeen sitting here for years waiting for scientists to just work it out like\nbleep bloop. [Oh this is why and exactly how it&rsquo;s different for people. There\nwe go.] Thinking I shouldn&rsquo;t run off my mouth on the internet in case my\ntheories and opinions on varying gayness get debunked next week. Well, I waited\nlong enough and it didn&rsquo;t happen. Science, ya fucked up, you let me down. And I\nfully expect to have to delete this video in two weeks when you find out all\nthe answers suddenly. Thanks a bunch. What makes someone gay or straight or all\nthe things in between? What the ever loving fuck is gender about? This is a\nmess. Yet people want you to give them a word because that&rsquo;s how humans\ncommunicate with words that have meanings. Which is why our disgusting species\nis impatient, stupid, and obsessed with labels. And this applies to everything,\nsexuality, gender, political identity, what obscure genre of synthwave you\nlisten to. People just want a label that represents something they understand\nso they already know how to feel about you and don&rsquo;t have to bother thinking. [Oh\nyou&rsquo;re a feminist well I don&rsquo;t need to know anything more. Oh you&rsquo;re a leftist.\nOh you&rsquo;re a K-pop fan but but but but.] If people just want to find a way to\ndisagree with you or dislike you, they can refer to the label and turn off\ntheir brains. Hey, what does my label say? Huh. The issue is, especially when\nwe start talking about the writhing mass of confusion and suffering that is\nsexual and gender identity, the limits of language and specific terminology\nbecome a big problem. What does being gay mean? You never thought about a boob\nonce? What does being a man mean? You wanna be an emotionless rock rubbing raw\nsteaks against your biceps? It&rsquo;s not like humanity is all in agreement right\nnow. I don&rsquo;t like the stereotypes and drama that come with all this terminology\nso I&rsquo;m just not gonna use it. Thing is gender identity isn&rsquo;t my issue. I feel\ncomfortable with the identity that I&rsquo;ve had my whole life. Dan, a tol boy from\nEngland. But being a man means nothing to me. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable\nwearing makeup or a sickening pair of heels, though I can&rsquo;t even draw in a\nstraight line so that would be a disaster. Also is anyone really comfortable\nwearing heels? Hmm. Icons of masculinity aren&rsquo;t really a big part of my life.\nMight as well call me a fucking formless blob that sounds more relatable. Shout\nout to all my formless blobs out there, rise up. I don&rsquo;t have to do anything or\nbe anything and I personally wouldn&rsquo;t feel offended if I wasn&rsquo;t referred to as\na he. Well, she&rsquo;s feeling hungry today. Stop fucking judging me, Susan. I&rsquo;m sad\nand I&rsquo;m gonna eat this whole damn cake whether you like it or not. But anyone\nthat has this don&rsquo;t really care attitude about their gender identity is in a\nway privileged 'cause some people, especially trans, care a lot about their\ngender identity and using the correct pronouns which other people should\nrespect. Likewise with sexuality, whilst to me the endlessly increasing list of\ntribes and flags being flown is a bit daunting and confusing and personally stresses\nme out 'cause I almost find it constrictive, some people like it. Because if\nyou&rsquo;re feelings are confusing and then you look at a word that represents\nsomething and go, &ldquo;wow, that me&rdquo;, it can help you realize you&rsquo;re valid and find\na community and that&rsquo;s great. There is so much controversy around this issue\nand others but if we all just calm down, respect each other&rsquo;s experiences and\ntry to just be nice, reasonable people, which is a lot to ask, let&rsquo;s be real,\nit&rsquo;s quite simple. If you wanna use language to express your honest feelings\nand identity, that&rsquo;s great and other people should respect what you say.\nLikewise, if you hate labels and you just wanna be a formless blob, that&rsquo;s\nfine, too. No one should force you. The only thing that isn&rsquo;t cool is telling\nother people what they should or should not identify as 'cause that ain&rsquo;t your problem\nor your business, bye. This was one of the things that held me back from\ntalking about this for years. Shit&rsquo;s confusing, man. Let&rsquo;s just go back to\ncellular reproduction by mytosis so I don&rsquo;t really have to be specific. Two\npeople that I really look up to and respect, Harry Styles and Janelle Monae, both\nfamously say that they don&rsquo;t feel the need to label it which, to be honest, is\nhow I feel and is perfectly okay. But I get it, for me, you want a word. Oh,\nthat&rsquo;s hard, though. I&rsquo;m an annoying guy. I feel uncertain specifying my\nsexuality in the same way I wouldn&rsquo;t say I am an atheist. Who the fuck am I to\nsay whether God does or doesn&rsquo;t exist? I don&rsquo;t know shit 'bout shit and neither\ndoes anyone else. I mean I think it&rsquo;s unlikely in the same way I know I like DICK.\nBut I&rsquo;m not gonna pretend to have a definite answer here. Looking at my public\nstatements is inconsistent and confusing. Looking at my personal track record\nthrough life is super confusing. And looking at the void inside my soul\nthreatening to crush the entire universe with the force of its event horizon of\nmisery and melodrama, well, fuck let&rsquo;s close that shit up. One thing&rsquo;s for sure\nwhatever heterosexual is, I ain&rsquo;t it. Really if you ask me, I don&rsquo;t think\nanyone&rsquo;s totally straight. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of social and emotional issues\ngetting in the way of yet to be understood feelings of attraction that can be\nvery flexible. And trust me, I&rsquo;ve known a lot of straight guys until a couple\nof drinks, some deep conversation, and lingering eye contact, and suddenly they\njust start leaning in. What does that make them? And am I totally gay? No. Am I\nslightly more gay or is it just easier for gays to hook up with each other\nbecause of societal norms. It&rsquo;s not like the signs for male and female\nbathrooms are what I&rsquo;m attracted to. I don&rsquo;t care what flesh organ you have\nbetween your legs, what your hair&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re covered in it or a fuckin&rsquo;\nbeluga whale. I&rsquo;m gonna be honest, I&rsquo;m not picky. I&rsquo;m easy. So am I bi or pan\nor poly? Well, now we&rsquo;re just in a clusterfuck of defining language and I&rsquo;m\nconfused and sad and horny. This is why I personally love the word queer. I\nunderstand that some people don&rsquo;t as it is a slur but as someone that&rsquo;s been\nthe target of it several times throughout my life I&rsquo;m up for some reclamation.\nIt&rsquo;s like recycling. The definition makes sense because until society is equal\nwith all sexual and gender identifies, it is literally strange from a\nconventional viewpoint plus it&rsquo;s better than a super long acronym, it&rsquo;s\ninclusive of everyone and therefore great for formless blobs. There we go, an\nidentity I feel comfortable with. A highly-strung, depressed queer praying for\na giant meteor to hurry up and finally eradicate humanity. LMAO, yeet!</p><p>But to come full circle, I know that even today, deep in my heart the\nword gay scares me because that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve been conditioned my whole life. So,\nyou know what? Fuck the literal definition and the scientific definition and\nwhat everyone thinks. I finally have to just confront and accept this.</p><p>I&rsquo;m gay.</p><p>Oh look, didn&rsquo;t spontaneously fucking combust. Well, there we go, that\nwas a lot of stress about nothing, wasn&rsquo;t it? Bloody hell. So yup, I&rsquo;m here,\nI&rsquo;m queer, and don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m still filled with existential fear.</p><p>WE&rsquo;RE HERE, WE&rsquo;RE QUEER WE&rsquo;RE FILLED WITH EXISTENTIAL FEAR. </p><p>Chapter 5 &ndash; Fear</p><p>Even though I&rsquo;m at this current place, there is still so much I&rsquo;m afraid\nof and this has taken months to make because of that. Telling my family was a\nbig fear. I have problems connecting with them emotionally because reasons. So\nI only came out to them this month and if it didn&rsquo;t go well, as I&rsquo;m now the\nindependent adult that I fought so hard to be, I was ready to cut them off like\nthe bottom of a sweater turning into a seasonal crop. But I didn&rsquo;t have to,\nlove you. I didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d reject me these days but coming out is still a\nsurprise. It changes things. And I&rsquo;m a pretty awkward person generally but the\nidea of just dropping this in conversation in front of them all terrified me. And\nI tried several times this year to do it but I just couldn&rsquo;t. So you know how I\nfinally came out to my family? E-mail. Yep, I literally just sent them an e-mail\nsaying and I quote, </p><p>&ldquo;Hello gang. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to talk to you all for a while,\nsomething quite important that should be disclosed at some point. I thought I\nwould around Christmas, then Mum&rsquo;s birthday, then last Easter Sunday, etc., but\nevery time I meant to, I either felt like I would ruin the mood of the day or I\njust felt awkward and didn&rsquo;t want to. So I decided just to email you all\ninstead which is really inappropriate and just weird but that somehow seems\nappropriate for me and at least I&rsquo;ll just finally say it. </p><p>Basically I&rsquo;m gay.&rdquo;</p><p>Yup. It was just getting ridiculous so I thought screw it and hey, it\nworked. Turns out my remaining family, pretty chill bunch of people. Even my\nChristian grandma said this,</p><p>&ldquo;We love you for being you. It must be a great relief to finally acknowledge\nwho you are. Popsie and I just want you to be happy. People are born as they\nare and have no say in it. I hope that now you will feel free to live your life\nas you want with no pretense.&rdquo;</p><p>Aw.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the iPad.&rdquo;</p><p>Yes, I said I&rsquo;d give her my old iPad. She mainly cares about that I\nthing. Wasn&rsquo;t so sure when I was 17 but it went well now and I know that makes\nme lucky but, hey, it shows that times change. As for the other people in my\nlife, obviously all the friends I have now are cool. If anyone in my life I&rsquo;ve\never known isn&rsquo;t cool with it then I don&rsquo;t care. And sure here online there\nmight be a few incredibly lost bigots following me or just some classic trolls\nwho I think should get fucked. No, like literally, I think you should try it.\nYou&rsquo;ll probably enjoy it and you might learn something about yourself. Inevitably\nsome of you watching this might have a weird reaction if you just feel like it\nwas a shock or you feel hurt that I kept it from you. But I feel like I\nexplained myself reasonably here and going forward I can&rsquo;t have any space for\nthat, sorry. I&rsquo;ve come to terms with who I am and now you have to, too, ha. Funnily\nenough straight up homophobia is probably the one thing I&rsquo;m not that afraid of,\nbecause I just don&rsquo;t agree so it doesn&rsquo;t hold much emotional power over me but\nyou bet I&rsquo;m opening myself up to all new kinds of in real life and international\ndiscrimination now which is fun. But one of the other big fears holding me back\nwas, honestly, that I wouldn&rsquo;t be accepted by the community. I know that it&rsquo;s a\nbig pride flag covering a lot of ground and even the idea of it and certainly\nmost of it is amazing. But there is a lot of drama within it right now\nespecially on the internet. You&rsquo;ve got Grindr gays arguing about how manly gays\nshould be, bi&rsquo;s getting ignored, trans people, especially of color, not being\nhistorically appreciated, acephobia, fucking SWERFs and TERFs. No thank you. So\neven though they my people, I know some of them will have problems with\nsomething. And even then, just seeing such a loud and proud, strong and\nopinionated group of people celebrating something just intimidates a smol\nintrovert such as myself. And in my mind if these people don&rsquo;t accept me because\nI&rsquo;m not being definitive enough or I took too long then I almost feel like I&rsquo;ll\nbe alone all over again, and this is a fear that a lot of people have honestly.\nBut I&rsquo;m a nice guy and I&rsquo;m trying my best so you better be welcoming, you bunch\nof fuckin&rsquo; queers. And obviously with the topic of sexuality, it doesn&rsquo;t matter\nwhere we are or how far you think we&rsquo;ve come, by merely mentioning it, I will\nbe opening up a primordial box of bullshit which will include every single\nstupid argument and question since the dawn of time. [It&rsquo;s not natural.]\nThere&rsquo;s gay animals. [Adam and Steve.] That&rsquo;s based on a story and the\nprotagonist that arrives later probably doesn&rsquo;t agree with you. [Why can&rsquo;t we\nhave straight pride?] I could spend 10 hours on all the classic crap and people\nwould still be asking the same things. This being posted on the internet, my\nhopes are so incredibly low, lower than my self-esteem. &nbsp;Wow, that is unhealthy. I need to stop doing\nthat. This video is about internalized oppression and the problems of language.\nI&rsquo;m not here to pontificate on every topic tangentially related to the entire\nconcept of gayness. *ASMR voice*: Pontificate on every topic tangentially\nrelated to the concept of gayness. &nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s other humans and all the time in the world left for that. The\ntime in the world coincidentally being not much longer. Climate change LMAO.\nBut I had to tell my story so people would understand me and these things. Why\ncoming out is still a big deal because queer people are often invisible and\nsuffering until they have to do it. Some people grow up in supportive\nenvironments and it&rsquo;s a positive experience. But more likely, especially around\nthe world outside of the big cities, it isn&rsquo;t. This is not a fight that is\nanywhere near over. Even in Britain today people are debating whether children\nshould be taught to be accepting of sexual and gender identity in school. </p><p>Queer people exist. Choosing not to accept them is not an option. </p><p>To anyone watching this that isn&rsquo;t out, it&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re okay. You were\nborn this way, it&rsquo;s right, and anyone that has a problem with it is wrong.\nBased on your circumstance, you might not feel ready to tell people yet or that\nit&rsquo;s safe and that&rsquo;s fine, too. Just know that living your truth, with pride,\nis the way to be happy. You are valid. It gets so much better. And the future\nis clear. It&rsquo;s pretty\nqueer. </p><p>So there we go. Now I can proceed authentically in my life with full\ndisclosure. Cute mutuals know to slide into the DMs. And you can all fuck off\nand leave me alone.</p><p>Bye.</p>",

In the list of things that identify a person, one of the most\nimportant for other people to know is their sexuality. For, if sex is the\nprimal force propelling all of these humans forward by their hips, they have to\nknow. Are we gonna fuck? Or like could we? Or are you, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m just\nwondering.
