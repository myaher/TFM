Where the protagonist speaks to the audience as they explain how a lead up of events brought them to where they are now.</p><p>Well\u2026that\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what is happening. However my lead up of events didn\u2019t involve me losing my dashingly good looks or even my sanity. No I never had those in the first place.</p><p>So this is the tale of how I ended up in a place I knew I would end up one day. In the prison cell of the avengers compound with nick fury winking at me every few seconds</p><p>So lets begin.</p><p>In west London born and raised there was a little girl who spent most of her days with her parents, loving every second. Until one day a bad man came along and said \u201cyour parents are up to no good, they\u2019re causing trouble in my organisation\u201d And with one little shot my parents weren\u2019t there. That\u2019s how I ended up in a hydra layer.</p><p>Sorry I had to do that to the tune of the fresh prince of bell air or else I get way too emotional. Anyway; yeah it was my birthday when the hydra agents came and shot my parents right in front of me. I was only 3 years old and I did not truly understand what was happening, but I did know that I no longer had a family and I was in for a bumpy ride.</p><p>I spent 10 years with hydra. 10 fucking gruelling years. Each day was unlike the rest but always the same; I was give the bare minimum of food, tortured, trained until I was either on the brink of death or brought other agents to the brink of theirs, tortured once again and then tested on like a stupid cage rat.</p><p>From day one hydra treated me like dirt, from day one I was thrusted into a training room with the misunderstood winter solider and from day one thousand eight hundred and twenty five I was hatching a plan to escape.</p><p>You see hydra thought that from kidnapping me at a young age I would never disobey there orders but they forgot one thing. At three years old I had already finished secondary school, in short I was a mother fucking genius and, like tony stark but better, I knew how to play the game.</p><p>My escape plan was meticulous and with my newfound powers, it was flawless. Oh yeah, I should probably mention that when hydra tortured me something awoke in my body. Yeah it turned out that I was a mutant and I had the ability to manipulate and control cells and particles, in short it means I can shape shift, have any powers I want and basically makes me a lot cooler than most avengers.</p><p>On the tenth anniversary of me being brought into this hellhole, I put my plan into action. Every morning at exactly five o\u2019clock Steve, the dumbest hydra agent alive, would come into my cell and give me a slither of bread, then leave. However that morning he wouldn\u2019t be leaving\u2026 flash back time</p><p><i>The low buzz echoed through out the cell, informing me that the doors were about to open.

Instead the noise gave me motivation; my plan was already in action.</i></p><p><i>As quick as humanly possible my body leapt from the \u2018bed\u2019 I had been lying on and in mere seconds I had camouflaged myself to blend in to the dreary walls.</i></p><p><i>Steve entered the room and placed the tray onto the ground, not yet realising I was not in my usual place. (</i>I told y\u2019all he was a dumbass) <i>this stupidity allowed me the opportunity to attack a bitch. He stood no chance against me, I did train (and defeat I may add) with the winter soldier, so with out breaking a sweat, the poor boy was left unconscious on the floor and I had manipulated the cells so that I looked like him and he looked like me.</i></p><p><i>Just like that I left the cell and Within thirty minutes there was nothing left but the ashes of hell. </i></p><p>To be honest I don\u2019t understand how the avengers take so long to take down a hydra attack, they are idiots. For one year I had been on the run and adapting to American life. Yeah, I had no idea that hydra had taken me to m\u2019erica and I didn\u2019t have any money to go back to England. I was stuck but adapting.</p><p>Within that year I had a lot of fun. I: stole wallets, learnt how to read and manipulate people so that I would benefit, learnt the whole range of my powers and survived on the streets. However that wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>I was bored. Like jury duty bored. I needed more excitement than stealing; at this point I had already developed a fake name and got a scholar ship into college, completed a degree. Each day seemed to suck the joy out of life into an endless black hole. So I went out looking for adventure and it was just my luck that I ran into the tony stark.</p><p>Tony stark was not looking where he was going; he thought that the world would just walk around him, as he was tony stark. Luckily for me I don\u2019t care for the world or for arrogance. I disguised myself as a ten-year-old girl and set myself into the way of his blind walking and waited for the impact of his body to hit mine.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably look where you are going\u201d starks snarky voice spoke to me as I crashed to the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s unsafe othwi\u2026\u201d his voice trailed off as his eyes reached mine and his face contorted into one of shock and shame.</p><p>You see tony stark had come to the realisation that he had accidently pushed down a young girl, who had just started crying.</p><p>My eyes filled with fake tears as I took one last look at starks panicked expression. I let my eyes fall to the disgusting street as I awaited his new response.</p><p>\u201cKid, Are you okay?\u201d Starks voice was surprisingly full of care as he allowed himself to sink to my level.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry sir. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d \u00a0I made my voice seemed chocked up, like I was holding back tears. This way I could get a hold onto Starks heart.</p><p>\u201cKid that doesn\u2019t answer my question. I asked if you were okay, not why this happened.\u201d I held back a sigh of exasperation. Even when a child is crying in front of him, he is still a snarky hoe.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think I\u2019m fine. Just a bit dizzy that\u2019s all.\u201d My voice was small, weak and, it was something that was sure to pull of Starks generated heartstrings.</p><p>\u201cHere let me help you stand up.\u201d Oh he was playing right into my plan. I used to think stark was a genius but he can\u2019t even notice a set up when its right under his nose.</p><p>Starks placed his hand in front of mine and I happily went to hold it. However I wasn\u2019t going to let him help me up, no where is the fun in that. I was going to deflate his ego by having a small, frail ten year old take his ass down.</p><p>Luckily for me the street we were in was secluded and unluckily for him I had still been training. His guard was down and mine was up, so that meant that in mere seconds Starks ass was unconscious and thrown into a dumpster, disguised as the trash. And I had transformed myself into him.</p><p>Now this was going to be fun.</p><p>tag list (hit me up if you want to be added)</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4cSrKkCaMJkxmNQOUg9VyA\">@fmb158581</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/me-1c-LLUt_iwwRSJD7yoGg\">@musicfreak180</a></p>",
