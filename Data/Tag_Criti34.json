Obviously with the campaign developing things have changed for both of them now that we know the full extent of their damage and backstories, and I don&rsquo;t know if EITHER can be in a healthy relationship, especially Caleb. However, literally every time they interact in one on one dialogue, they have this intense energy of understanding and connection, and when it&rsquo;s just small interactions it always kinda feels like cute flirts or just adorable moments whether it was shippy or not. I really love their comradery and their similarities, and the day that Fjord finally finds the words to explain who he was, and Caleb finds the courage to explain who HE was to each other, I cannot wait to see that unfold (especially the angst, Fjord will NOT take Caleb killing his parents well)</p><p>So like, let&rsquo;s throw shipping aside for a second, I feel like these 2 characters bounce off of each other and compliment each other to create intense and meaningful RP, and since they are probably never gonna be canon, even seeing them become the closest of friends, best friends even, would be amazing and I think would really help them heal mentally and emotionally.</p><p>Yeah so that&rsquo;s my say on shipping. Also BeauJester is really cute I like that as well but I don&rsquo;t feel so strongly about it that I&rsquo;d be sad if it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>",
