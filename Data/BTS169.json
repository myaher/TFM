Cheers erupt around you in response to whatever is happening down on the field but you don\u2019t know what happened. SOMEBODY or rather SOMEBODIES are making it very difficult for you to be enjoying this game. And two of those SOMEBODIES have decided that since they\u2019re wearing jerseys, it\u2019s necessary to high-five every other person that is also wearing a jersey\u2014which is literally ninety-nine percent of the people here.</p><p>\u201cKim Taehyung and Jung Hoseok! Get your butts back here before I drag you to our seats by your nose hairs!\u201d you yell.</p><!-- more --><p>The two boys are halfway down the row, slapping hands and exchanging bro-hugs with the crazed strangers, fists pumping in the air even though they have absolutely no clue what\u2019s going on. They either didn\u2019t hear you or are completely ignoring you. Either way, they aren\u2019t looking in your direction.</p><p>With a sigh, you look around in hopes that any of the other members are within shouting distance and willing to help you. No such luck.</p><p>An idea comes to you and you squeeze your eyes shut. There\u2019s always one way to get Hobi\u2019s attention but in front of all these strangers does not seem like the best place to do it. Ugh, this is gonna suck. You take in a deep breath and cup your hands on either side of your mouth.</p><p>\u201cJHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE!!!!\u201d Your voice rises above the cheers and by the time you\u2019re done and have opened your eyes, the two members have turned to gape at you.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Hoseok yells back, waving wildly.</p><p>You can feel your face burning bright red and you lower your head as you motion for the boys to come to you. Once they\u2019re both within reach, you grab the collars of each of their jerseys in your fists and drag them back down the steps toward your row.</p><p>\u201cWould you two stop trying to make friends with everyone here?\u201d you ask them after they\u2019ve plopped down into their seats.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought we\u2019re supposed to high five everyone that\u2019s wearing our team\u2019s jersey,\u201d Taehyung says looking up at you, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI sort of just meant the people within our vicinity. Not the whole freaking stadium. And I meant it as like a suggestion, not a written rule. Do I need Jin-oppa to babysit you? Oppa, could you\u2014\u201d when you turn to the oldest, you\u2019re surprised to find him hunched over a plate of nachos. He looks up at the mention of his name, mid-bite, \u00a0\u201cDidn\u2019t you have three hotdogs when I left you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says with his mouth full of chips and cheese.</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cWell, could you watch these two knuckleheads for a minute while I try to go find Yoongi and Jimin?\u201d</p><p>Jin nods before shoving another loaded chip in his mouth and then you\u2019re off again on another manhunt. At least Jungkook isn\u2019t giving you any trouble. He\u2019s been enthralled with the game the whole time, his eyes following the players back and forth across the field, brows knitted together as he tries to understand the rules of American football. Namjoon is beside him, also looking just as intently, though he\u2019s more focused on the people sitting in the stands below you. Who knows what\u2019s going on in that boy\u2019s head? He\u2019s probably trying to figure each person out. Trying to imagine what that person\u2019s life and their troubles must be like.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Either way, Jimin and Yoongi are missing and now you have to find them.</p><p>You sidestep back out of your row, this time cutting down the stairs to the lower exit and head for the first place on the list of places they could be. Bathrooms. Other than freaking out a few unsuspecting men when you peek your head in and call for the two, that first place is a bust. Okay, next? Maybe they were hungry and are standing in line at one of the concession stands. By the time you\u2019ve walked almost the whole expanse of your side of the stadium, you\u2019re winded and beginning to panic. What if something happened to them? What if someone recognized them and took them? Their managers would kill you. </p><p>Even as you feel your heart ready to burst out of your chest, you break into a jog, eyes roving over every cart and searching every corner for the maknae and rapper. When you finally do find them, sitting at a cafe table in a low lit bar, you feel your whole body relax with relief. The relief is short lived, though, when you see that they both are nursing a glass of beer and a cluster of empty ones sit beside them.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d you growl as you stomp toward them. \u201cWhat do you two think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Jimin looks up first, holding out his glass as if cheering to you. \u201cNoona!\u201d he sings, his eyes bright and glassy, a dopy grin spread across his face so his crooked front tooth is on full display.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just run off from the group like that,\u201d you say making your way around their table. You freeze when you see just how many empty glasses there are. \u201cHow much have you guys had to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit,\u201d Yoongi utters, his voice low and syrupy. Yeah, \u201ca bit\u201d is an understatement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be watching the game. Not getting wasted,\u201d you say and take Jimin\u2019s glass out of his hand. He slumps against you, nuzzling his head into your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, noona,\u201d he purrs. \u201cJoin us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave the others to their own devices for very long,\u201d you say and try to get him to sit back up. It\u2019s no use. The boy turns into a koala when he\u2019s drunk.</p><p>He throws his arms around your waist, this time burying his nose in your neck. \u201cThe others can take care of themselves,\u201d he says, his stale breath hot against your skin.</p><p>You try not to cringe as you shrink away. \u201cCome on, guys,\u201d you say. \u201cYoongi, grab Jimin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too touchy when he drinks,\u201d Yoongi pouts but gets up anyway and pulls Jimin to him.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d you utter as you turn away and start leading the two back toward the entrance to the stands.</p><p>Luckily, Taehyung and Hoseok haven\u2019t wandered too far from your row this time and you\u2019re able to grab them again on the way back. The others are still in their seats behaving, though now Jin is lapping at an ice cream cone while a plate of chili cheese fries occupies his lap, the nachos have completely disappeared. You\u2019re not even going to ask.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you say as you guide Jimin down into his seat. \u201cI think I\u2019ve finally got\u2014crap. Where\u2019d Jungkook go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got picked for some halftime contest,\u201d Namjoon says and leans over to grab a few fries from Jin\u2019s lap, snatching them just in time to retract his hand before the older can slap it away.</p><p>You can physically feel the color draining from your face.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, noona,\u201d Taehyung says standing up beside you. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure the guy was stadium staff?\u201d you ask quietly.</p><p>The other members exchange nervous glances. \u201cI mean, he was wearing a staff shirt,\u201d Jin says.</p><p>\u201cWhich way did they go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoooooood evening, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d the announcer\u2019s voice booms over the speakers causing you all to jump in surprise. \u201cPleeeeease turn your attention to center field where one lucky fan will attempt to kick a field goal.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes shoot down to the field where you see Jungkook standing behind a ball resting on a tee on the thirty yard line. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d you utter as you watch a man approach him with a microphone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, son?\u201d the man asks, his voice echoing through the arena.</p><p>\u201cJungkook.\u201d</p><p>At that, the other six members burst into a fit of screaming and clapping and you see him turn to wave in your direction. The people around you turn to glance at your section and you feel heat creep up your face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an odd name,\u201d the announcer continues. \u201cWhere are you from, Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKorea.\u201d</p><p>The boys scream again.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, Jungkook from Korea, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d Jungkook says in broken English. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the announcer says and backs up. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>A hush falls over the crowd and you find yourself reaching out to either side to grip onto the closest thing to you. This just so happens to be Taehyung\u2019s and Jimin\u2019s fingers as they were both reaching out as well. You watch with bated breath as the maknae down on the field\u2014he looks so small. Why does he look so small?\u2014backs up a bit so he can get a running start. Then, he surges forward, swinging his foot to connect with the ball. It sails through the air and a wave of turning heads fans across the arena as everyone\u2019s eyes follow the ball. It flies between the goal posts and sinks into the net.</p><p>Suddenly the stands burst into applause, the excitement eliciting a scream from within you before you can even fully comprehend what has happened. You turn to your right and throw your arms around Taehyung, at the same time feeling Jimin hug you from behind and the three of you jump in tandem in a celebratory sandwich. Then you feel swayed forward and back as the other members grab on and before long, you\u2019re all hugging and jumping in a screaming heap. With euphoria rushing through your veins you turn your head and look at the field again to find Jungkook running at you. He jumps, scrambling up over the guardrail and racing up the steps to your seats where you all wait with open arms. With another roar of excitement, he barrels into you and crushes you to him, the rest closing around you so the two of you are at the center.</p><p>\u201cI did it, noona!\u201d he screams in your ear.</p><p>\u201cI saw!\u201d you scream back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what I won!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! You did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d</p><p>The rest of the crowd has calmed down by now and as the eight of you untangle yourselves from each other, the fans above and below reach out to congratulate Jungkook for his incredible kick. It was pretty amazing. But nothing you thought he couldn\u2019t do. The boy isn\u2019t called the golden maknae for nothing.</p><p>\u201cOh, halftime!\u201d Hoseok exclaims suddenly jumping back to his feet after you all have taken your seats. \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say. \u201cAnother twenty minutes, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok turns to Taehyung. \u201cI bet I can get more high-fives than you!\u201d</p><p>Yoongi gets up too, pulling Jimin to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s totally enough time to make it down the rest of the beer tasting menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessssuh, Sugaaaaa!\u201d Jimin yells pumping his fists in the air and following after his hyung.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you call after them.</p><p>\u201cJungkookie, come with us\u201d Jimin says and pulls the maknae after him.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you say a little quieter.</p><p>Jin stands up next, shuffling past you. \u201cI saw a churro cart earlier I wanted to stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Namjoon chimes in trailing after him.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you utter as you helplessly watch the others fan out in all directions. Then you look around at the empty row to your left and right. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait here, then,\u201d you say then slump down in your chair in defeat.</p>",

Either way, they aren\u2019t looking in your direction.</p><p>With a sigh, you look around in hopes that any of the other members are within shouting distance and willing to help you. No such luck.</p><p>An idea comes to you and you squeeze your eyes shut. There\u2019s always one way to get Hobi\u2019s attention but in front of all these strangers does not seem like the best place to do it. Ugh, this is gonna suck. You take in a deep breath and cup your hands on either side of your mouth.</p><p>\u201cJHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE!!!!\u201d Your voice rises above the cheers and by the time you\u2019re done and have opened your eyes, the two members have turned to gape at you.</p><p>\u201cY/N!\u201d Hoseok yells back, waving wildly.</p><p>You can feel your face burning bright red and you lower your head as you motion for the boys to come to you. Once they\u2019re both within reach, you grab the collars of each of their jerseys in your fists and drag them back down the steps toward your row.</p><p>\u201cWould you two stop trying to make friends with everyone here?\u201d you ask them after they\u2019ve plopped down into their seats.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought we\u2019re supposed to high five everyone that\u2019s wearing our team\u2019s jersey,\u201d Taehyung says looking up at you, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI sort of just meant the people within our vicinity. Not the whole freaking stadium. And I meant it as like a suggestion, not a written rule. Do I need Jin-oppa to babysit you? Oppa, could you\u2014\u201d when you turn to the oldest, you\u2019re surprised to find him hunched over a plate of nachos. He looks up at the mention of his name, mid-bite, \u00a0\u201cDidn\u2019t you have three hotdogs when I left you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says with his mouth full of chips and cheese.</p><p>You shake your head. \u201cWell, could you watch these two knuckleheads for a minute while I try to go find Yoongi and Jimin?\u201d</p><p>Jin nods before shoving another loaded chip in his mouth and then you\u2019re off again on another manhunt. At least Jungkook isn\u2019t giving you any trouble. He\u2019s been enthralled with the game the whole time, his eyes following the players back and forth across the field, brows knitted together as he tries to understand the rules of American football. Namjoon is beside him, also looking just as intently, though he\u2019s more focused on the people sitting in the stands below you. Who knows what\u2019s going on in that boy\u2019s head? He\u2019s probably trying to figure each person out. Trying to imagine what that person\u2019s life and their troubles must be like.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Either way, Jimin and Yoongi are missing and now you have to find them.</p><p>You sidestep back out of your row, this time cutting down the stairs to the lower exit and head for the first place on the list of places they could be. Bathrooms. Other than freaking out a few unsuspecting men when you peek your head in and call for the two, that first place is a bust. Okay, next? Maybe they were hungry and are standing in line at one of the concession stands. By the time you\u2019ve walked almost the whole expanse of your side of the stadium, you\u2019re winded and beginning to panic. What if something happened to them? What if someone recognized them and took them? Their managers would kill you. </p><p>Even as you feel your heart ready to burst out of your chest, you break into a jog, eyes roving over every cart and searching every corner for the maknae and rapper. When you finally do find them, sitting at a cafe table in a low lit bar, you feel your whole body relax with relief. The relief is short lived, though, when you see that they both are nursing a glass of beer and a cluster of empty ones sit beside them.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d you growl as you stomp toward them. \u201cWhat do you two think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Jimin looks up first, holding out his glass as if cheering to you. \u201cNoona!\u201d he sings, his eyes bright and glassy, a dopy grin spread across his face so his crooked front tooth is on full display.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just run off from the group like that,\u201d you say making your way around their table. You freeze when you see just how many empty glasses there are. \u201cHow much have you guys had to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit,\u201d Yoongi utters, his voice low and syrupy. Yeah, \u201ca bit\u201d is an understatement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be watching the game. Not getting wasted,\u201d you say and take Jimin\u2019s glass out of his hand. He slumps against you, nuzzling his head into your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, noona,\u201d he purrs. \u201cJoin us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave the others to their own devices for very long,\u201d you say and try to get him to sit back up. It\u2019s no use. The boy turns into a koala when he\u2019s drunk.</p><p>He throws his arms around your waist, this time burying his nose in your neck. \u201cThe others can take care of themselves,\u201d he says, his stale breath hot against your skin.</p><p>You try not to cringe as you shrink away. \u201cCome on, guys,\u201d you say. \u201cYoongi, grab Jimin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too touchy when he drinks,\u201d Yoongi pouts but gets up anyway and pulls Jimin to him.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d you utter as you turn away and start leading the two back toward the entrance to the stands.</p><p>Luckily, Taehyung and Hoseok haven\u2019t wandered too far from your row this time and you\u2019re able to grab them again on the way back. The others are still in their seats behaving, though now Jin is lapping at an ice cream cone while a plate of chili cheese fries occupies his lap, the nachos have completely disappeared. You\u2019re not even going to ask.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you say as you guide Jimin down into his seat. \u201cI think I\u2019ve finally got\u2014crap. Where\u2019d Jungkook go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got picked for some halftime contest,\u201d Namjoon says and leans over to grab a few fries from Jin\u2019s lap, snatching them just in time to retract his hand before the older can slap it away.</p><p>You can physically feel the color draining from your face.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, noona,\u201d Taehyung says standing up beside you. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure the guy was stadium staff?\u201d you ask quietly.</p><p>The other members exchange nervous glances. \u201cI mean, he was wearing a staff shirt,\u201d Jin says.</p><p>\u201cWhich way did they go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoooooood evening, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d the announcer\u2019s voice booms over the speakers causing you all to jump in surprise. \u201cPleeeeease turn your attention to center field where one lucky fan will attempt to kick a field goal.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes shoot down to the field where you see Jungkook standing behind a ball resting on a tee on the thirty yard line. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d you utter as you watch a man approach him with a microphone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, son?\u201d the man asks, his voice echoing through the arena.</p><p>\u201cJungkook.\u201d</p><p>At that, the other six members burst into a fit of screaming and clapping and you see him turn to wave in your direction. The people around you turn to glance at your section and you feel heat creep up your face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an odd name,\u201d the announcer continues. \u201cWhere are you from, Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKorea.\u201d</p><p>The boys scream again.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, Jungkook from Korea, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d Jungkook says in broken English. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the announcer says and backs up. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>A hush falls over the crowd and you find yourself reaching out to either side to grip onto the closest thing to you. This just so happens to be Taehyung\u2019s and Jimin\u2019s fingers as they were both reaching out as well. You watch with bated breath as the maknae down on the field\u2014he looks so small. Why does he look so small?\u2014backs up a bit so he can get a running start. Then, he surges forward, swinging his foot to connect with the ball. It sails through the air and a wave of turning heads fans across the arena as everyone\u2019s eyes follow the ball. It flies between the goal posts and sinks into the net.</p><p>Suddenly the stands burst into applause, the excitement eliciting a scream from within you before you can even fully comprehend what has happened. You turn to your right and throw your arms around Taehyung, at the same time feeling Jimin hug you from behind and the three of you jump in tandem in a celebratory sandwich. Then you feel swayed forward and back as the other members grab on and before long, you\u2019re all hugging and jumping in a screaming heap. With euphoria rushing through your veins you turn your head and look at the field again to find Jungkook running at you. He jumps, scrambling up over the guardrail and racing up the steps to your seats where you all wait with open arms. With another roar of excitement, he barrels into you and crushes you to him, the rest closing around you so the two of you are at the center.</p><p>\u201cI did it, noona!\u201d he screams in your ear.</p><p>\u201cI saw!\u201d you scream back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what I won!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! You did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d</p><p>The rest of the crowd has calmed down by now and as the eight of you untangle yourselves from each other, the fans above and below reach out to congratulate Jungkook for his incredible kick. It was pretty amazing. But nothing you thought he couldn\u2019t do. The boy isn\u2019t called the golden maknae for nothing.</p><p>\u201cOh, halftime!\u201d Hoseok exclaims suddenly jumping back to his feet after you all have taken your seats. \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say. \u201cAnother twenty minutes, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok turns to Taehyung. \u201cI bet I can get more high-fives than you!\u201d</p><p>Yoongi gets up too, pulling Jimin to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s totally enough time to make it down the rest of the beer tasting menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessssuh, Sugaaaaa!\u201d Jimin yells pumping his fists in the air and following after his hyung.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you call after them.</p><p>\u201cJungkookie, come with us\u201d Jimin says and pulls the maknae after him.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you say a little quieter.</p><p>Jin stands up next, shuffling past you. \u201cI saw a churro cart earlier I wanted to stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Namjoon chimes in trailing after him.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you utter as you helplessly watch the others fan out in all directions. Then you look around at the empty row to your left and right. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait here, then,\u201d you say then slump down in your chair in defeat.</p>",

The people around you turn to glance at your section and you feel heat creep up your face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an odd name,\u201d the announcer continues. \u201cWhere are you from, Jungkook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKorea.\u201d</p><p>The boys scream again.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, Jungkook from Korea, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d Jungkook says in broken English. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the announcer says and backs up. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, Jungkook.\u201d</p><p>A hush falls over the crowd and you find yourself reaching out to either side to grip onto the closest thing to you. This just so happens to be Taehyung\u2019s and Jimin\u2019s fingers as they were both reaching out as well. You watch with bated breath as the maknae down on the field\u2014he looks so small. Why does he look so small?\u2014backs up a bit so he can get a running start. Then, he surges forward, swinging his foot to connect with the ball. It sails through the air and a wave of turning heads fans across the arena as everyone\u2019s eyes follow the ball. It flies between the goal posts and sinks into the net.</p><p>Suddenly the stands burst into applause, the excitement eliciting a scream from within you before you can even fully comprehend what has happened. You turn to your right and throw your arms around Taehyung, at the same time feeling Jimin hug you from behind and the three of you jump in tandem in a celebratory sandwich. Then you feel swayed forward and back as the other members grab on and before long, you\u2019re all hugging and jumping in a screaming heap. With euphoria rushing through your veins you turn your head and look at the field again to find Jungkook running at you. He jumps, scrambling up over the guardrail and racing up the steps to your seats where you all wait with open arms. With another roar of excitement, he barrels into you and crushes you to him, the rest closing around you so the two of you are at the center.</p><p>\u201cI did it, noona!\u201d he screams in your ear.</p><p>\u201cI saw!\u201d you scream back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what I won!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! You did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d</p><p>The rest of the crowd has calmed down by now and as the eight of you untangle yourselves from each other, the fans above and below reach out to congratulate Jungkook for his incredible kick. It was pretty amazing. But nothing you thought he couldn\u2019t do. The boy isn\u2019t called the golden maknae for nothing.</p><p>\u201cOh, halftime!\u201d Hoseok exclaims suddenly jumping back to his feet after you all have taken your seats. \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say. \u201cAnother twenty minutes, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok turns to Taehyung. \u201cI bet I can get more high-fives than you!\u201d</p><p>Yoongi gets up too, pulling Jimin to his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s totally enough time to make it down the rest of the beer tasting menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessssuh, Sugaaaaa!\u201d Jimin yells pumping his fists in the air and following after his hyung.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you call after them.</p><p>\u201cJungkookie, come with us\u201d Jimin says and pulls the maknae after him.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you say a little quieter.</p><p>Jin stands up next, shuffling past you. \u201cI saw a churro cart earlier I wanted to stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Namjoon chimes in trailing after him.</p><p>\u201cGuys,\u201d you utter as you helplessly watch the others fan out in all directions. Then you look around at the empty row to your left and right. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait here, then,\u201d you say then slump down in your chair in defeat.</p>",

She&rsquo;s a bottomless well of ideas.</p><p>This ends my&nbsp;&ldquo;30 fics in 30 days&rdquo; challenge even though I sort of failed by taking a few days off BUT 30 fics in a little over 30 days is still an accomplishment, right? As long as Tumblr doesn&rsquo;t crumble, I plan to keep posting my work hopefully twice a week. I&rsquo;m also working on a new series and will hopefully actually start writing it soon. Thank you everyone for liking and reblogging and commenting on my fics. You&rsquo;re the gasoline that fuels my passion for writing &#128156;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;Why did I think this was a good idea?&rdquo; you utter to yourself as you stamp up the stairs of the stadium. Cheers erupt around you in response to whatever is happening down on the field but you don&rsquo;t know what happened. SOMEBODY or rather SOMEBODIES are making it very difficult for you to be enjoying this game. And two of those SOMEBODIES have decided that since they&rsquo;re wearing jerseys, it&rsquo;s necessary to high-five every other person that is also wearing a jersey&mdash;which is literally ninety-nine percent of the people here.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Taehyung and Jung Hoseok! Get your butts back here before I drag you to our seats by your nose hairs!&rdquo; you yell.</p><p>The two boys are halfway down the row, slapping hands and exchanging bro-hugs with the crazed strangers, fists pumping in the air even though they have absolutely no clue what&rsquo;s going on. They either didn&rsquo;t hear you or are completely ignoring you. Either way, they aren&rsquo;t looking in your direction.</p><p>With a sigh, you look around in hopes that any of the other members are within shouting distance and willing to help you. No such luck.</p><p>An idea comes to you and you squeeze your eyes shut. There&rsquo;s always one way to get Hobi&rsquo;s attention but in front of all these strangers does not seem like the best place to do it. Ugh, this is gonna suck. You take in a deep breath and cup your hands on either side of your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;JHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE!!!!&rdquo; Your voice rises above the cheers and by the time you&rsquo;re done and have opened your eyes, the two members have turned to gape at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; Hoseok yells back, waving wildly.</p><p>You can feel your face burning bright red and you lower your head as you motion for the boys to come to you. Once they&rsquo;re both within reach, you grab the collars of each of their jerseys in your fists and drag them back down the steps toward your row.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you two stop trying to make friends with everyone here?&rdquo; you ask them after they&rsquo;ve plopped down into their seats.</p><p>&ldquo;But I thought we&rsquo;re supposed to high five everyone that&rsquo;s wearing our team&rsquo;s jersey,&rdquo; Taehyung says looking up at you, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;I sort of just meant the people within our vicinity. Not the whole freaking stadium. And I meant it as like a suggestion, not a written rule. Do I need Jin-oppa to babysit you? Oppa, could you&mdash;&rdquo; when you turn to the oldest, you&rsquo;re surprised to find him hunched over a plate of nachos. He looks up at the mention of his name, mid-bite, &nbsp;&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you have three hotdogs when I left you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says with his mouth full of chips and cheese.</p><p>You shake your head. &ldquo;Well, could you watch these two knuckleheads for a minute while I try to go find Yoongi and Jimin?&rdquo;</p><p>Jin nods before shoving another loaded chip in his mouth and then you&rsquo;re off again on another manhunt. At least Jungkook isn&rsquo;t giving you any trouble. He&rsquo;s been enthralled with the game the whole time, his eyes following the players back and forth across the field, brows knitted together as he tries to understand the rules of American football. Namjoon is beside him, also looking just as intently, though he&rsquo;s more focused on the people sitting in the stands below you. Who knows what&rsquo;s going on in that boy&rsquo;s head? He&rsquo;s probably trying to figure each person out. Trying to imagine what that person&rsquo;s life and their troubles must be like.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Either way, Jimin and Yoongi are missing and now you have to find them.</p><p>You sidestep back out of your row, this time cutting down the stairs to the lower exit and head for the first place on the list of places they could be. Bathrooms. Other than freaking out a few unsuspecting men when you peek your head in and call for the two, that first place is a bust. Okay, next? Maybe they were hungry and are standing in line at one of the concession stands. By the time you&rsquo;ve walked almost the whole expanse of your side of the stadium, you&rsquo;re winded and beginning to panic. What if something happened to them? What if someone recognized them and took them? Their managers would kill you. </p><p>Even as you feel your heart ready to burst out of your chest, you break into a jog, eyes roving over every cart and searching every corner for the maknae and rapper. When you finally do find them, sitting at a cafe table in a low lit bar, you feel your whole body relax with relief. The relief is short lived, though, when you see that they both are nursing a glass of beer and a cluster of empty ones sit beside them.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; you growl as you stomp toward them. &ldquo;What do you two think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin looks up first, holding out his glass as if cheering to you. &ldquo;Noona!&rdquo; he sings, his eyes bright and glassy, a dopy grin spread across his face so his crooked front tooth is on full display.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just run off from the group like that,&rdquo; you say making your way around their table. You freeze when you see just how many empty glasses there are. &ldquo;How much have you guys had to drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; Yoongi utters, his voice low and syrupy. Yeah, &ldquo;a bit&rdquo; is an understatement.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be watching the game. Not getting wasted,&rdquo; you say and take Jimin&rsquo;s glass out of his hand. He slumps against you, nuzzling his head into your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad, noona,&rdquo; he purrs. &ldquo;Join us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave the others to their own devices for very long,&rdquo; you say and try to get him to sit back up. It&rsquo;s no use. The boy turns into a koala when he&rsquo;s drunk.</p><p>He throws his arms around your waist, this time burying his nose in your neck. &ldquo;The others can take care of themselves,&rdquo; he says, his stale breath hot against your skin.</p><p>You try not to cringe as you shrink away. &ldquo;Come on, guys,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;Yoongi, grab Jimin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too touchy when he drinks,&rdquo; Yoongi pouts but gets up anyway and pulls Jimin to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo; you utter as you turn away and start leading the two back toward the entrance to the stands.</p><p>Luckily, Taehyung and Hoseok haven&rsquo;t wandered too far from your row this time and you&rsquo;re able to grab them again on the way back. The others are still in their seats behaving, though now Jin is lapping at an ice cream cone while a plate of chili cheese fries occupies his lap, the nachos have completely disappeared. You&rsquo;re not even going to ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you say as you guide Jimin down into his seat. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve finally got&mdash;crap. Where&rsquo;d Jungkook go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He got picked for some halftime contest,&rdquo; Namjoon says and leans over to grab a few fries from Jin&rsquo;s lap, snatching them just in time to retract his hand before the older can slap it away.</p><p>You can physically feel the color draining from your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, noona,&rdquo; Taehyung says standing up beside you. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look so good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you absolutely sure the guy was stadium staff?&rdquo; you ask quietly.</p><p>The other members exchange nervous glances. &ldquo;I mean, he was wearing a staff shirt,&rdquo; Jin says.</p><p>&ldquo;Which way did they go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Goooooood evening, ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo; the announcer&rsquo;s voice booms over the speakers causing you all to jump in surprise. &ldquo;Pleeeeease turn your attention to center field where one lucky fan will attempt to kick a field goal.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes shoot down to the field where you see Jungkook standing behind a ball resting on a tee on the thirty yard line. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me,&rdquo; you utter as you watch a man approach him with a microphone.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, son?&rdquo; the man asks, his voice echoing through the arena.</p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook.&rdquo;</p><p>At that, the other six members burst into a fit of screaming and clapping and you see him turn to wave in your direction.

Your post partum depression had been showing up more often than not lately and it caused you to develop the habit of not eating much, which worried Jin immensely.\u00a0</p><p>He walked over to the counter, where you were sat in a chair. He set the plate in front of you and then sat down in the chair next to yours.\u00a0\u201cThink you might be hungry jagi?\u201d He wondered, hoping you\u2019d finally say yes. However, those hopes were dashed as you shook your head slightly.</p><p>\u201cNot hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on jagiya,\u201d Jin whispered.\u00a0\u201cYou must be hungry by now. I don\u2019t want you getting sick.\u201d You turned your head towards him and you sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cToo tired to,\u201d you admitted. Jin nodded and thought for a moment, when an idea suddenly popped into his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about if I feed you? Would that be ok?\u201d He wondered and after a few seconds, you hesitantly nodded in agreement. Jin picked up the fork he\u2019d brought over with the plate and used it to stab a piece of bulgogi. Holding his hand underneath the fork, he brought it up to your lips and you slowly opened your mouth. You chewed thoroughly on the meat while Jin </p><p>watched you with a small grin on his face, happy that he\u2019d gotten you to eat something.</p><p>\u201cGood job jagi,\u201d he praised.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Min Yoongi</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"1lsans:aabwMixSNDlUqh1wQwAtqA:ZNaSxu2e94HlV\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e43d796f0a39c2acbd64974d3b5433d/tumblr_pisb5vqftJ1rzcklqo1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\"/></figure><p>Yoongi searched for your waist to pull you closer to him but when he realized that you weren\u2019t in bed, his eyes instantly popped open. He looked at the clock, seeing that it was 3:36 am. Figuring that you were probably just in Kinsley\u2019s room, he removed the covers from his body before sitting up and getting out of bed.\u00a0</p><p>He paced out of your shared bedroom down the hall to where Kinsley\u2019s room was. However, when he peaked inside, Kinsley was inside of her crib sleeping peacefully and you were nowhere to be found. He then descended the stairs, walking into the living room. There you were, sat in your easy chair next to the window. He walked over to you, setting his hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up Y/N?\u201d He muttered, his hand moving soothingly on your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d you replied meekly, taking a second to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night,\u201d you admitted, making Yoongi sigh in disappointment. He moved so that he was in front of you and then knelt down so that he was looking up at you. He took your hands in his, squeezing them lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe thoughts, right?\u201d He asked and you nodded. Your post partum depression had manifested itself in anxiety and you had found yourself constantly worrying over things you would\u2019ve never given any thought to otherwise. Yoongi brought your hands up to his lips and kissed them softly.</p><p>\u201cYou know that everything\u2019s ok, yeah? I love you and Kinsley loves you and we\u2019re safe,\u201d he reassured you. You closed your eyes and took a deep breath in and out, trying to get your brain to release all of the negative thoughts that you were having. You then replayed Yoongi\u2019s words in your mind a few times, before opening your eyes and looking down at Yoongi. You smiled softly, which let him know that you were trying.</p><p>\u201cHere, let\u2019s go to bed baby,\u201d he cooed, helping you stand up from the chair before leading you upstairs.</p><h2><b>Kim Namjoon</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"samwol:sF1DRZeLSkKoetMiEvabuw:ZgDC0e2WXNVRj\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/850cd9fb0337cd5d680c78559298936a/tumblr_p6bq8cB9Gw1wofqfvo1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\"/></figure><p>When you woke up this morning, you automatically knew that today was another one of those days. It had actually been a while since the last time you had felt this horrible so it definitely caught you off guard.\u00a0</p><p>You were still in bed when Namjoon walked upstairs to wake you up for breakfast. When he saw you laying motionless, he instantly knew what was going on.</p><p>\u201cJagi?\u201d He called as he walked over to the bed. He kneeled down so that his face was level with yours as you looked at his wordlessly.\u00a0\u201cAre you hungry? I made us some breakfast downstairs,\u201d he told you. You shook your head and he titled his head at you.</p><p>\u201cI can bring it to you, if you want. You don\u2019t have to get up if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he offered. You nodded slightly and he got up and walked out of the room. A few minutes later, he came back with a tray in his hands. He walked over to the bed and set the tray in the bed next to you.</p><p>\u201cI want you to try and eat as much as you possibly can, alright?\u201d He asked and you nodded again. He turned to walk out of the room but you reached out and grabbed his wrist, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you mumbled and he smiled at you.\u00a0\u201cGive Mason a kiss for me too, please?\u201d He nodded and bent down, pressing a kiss to your forehead.</p><p>\u201cI will. Eat and get some rest, yeah?\u201d He instructed before walking out of the room.</p><h2><b>Jung Hoseok</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"j-hope:KRXjFnStcL_9-7b0CFh3aQ:Zrehdd2YbZ1ph\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d475867ce2a62d920bd18f6ec8633e6/tumblr_p9thu6fq7H1wsz39wo1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\"/></figure><p>Hobi quietly shut the door to the twins\u2019 room, not wanting to wake them up after managing to finally get them down for their nap. He walked across the hall to your share bedroom and he paused when he heard light sniffling. Peaking his head into the room, he saw you laying in bed and your shoulders were heaving which let him know that you were crying.</p><p>\u201cY/N-ah,\u201d Hobi gasped as he quickly walked into the room. He climbed into bed, snuggling up to you so that his chest was pressed against your back.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry Hobi,\u201d you apologized but Hobi gently shushed you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me Y/N. What\u2019s wrong baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, I just feel so overwhelmed. I\u2019m tired but they always need something and I don\u2019t have the time to take care of myself,\u201d you ranted and Hobi knew that by\u00a0\u2018they\u2019, you meant the twins. He sighed heavily and pressed a kiss to the back of your head.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018I know Y/N, and I hate that I can\u2019t be here more often to help you with them. You have been doing amazing, though. Berkeley and Lennox couldn\u2019t have a better mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d You asked meekly. Hobi tightened his arms around you as a response and you relaxed into him. A few seconds of silence passed before you spoke up again.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing great too Hobi.\u201d He smiled at your words and gave you another kiss on your head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love Y/N, so much.\u201d</p><h2><b>Park Jimin</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"mimibtsghost:YELJPMnDgSoVTcHVUZFKrw:ZYRG4f2bFKkZq\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e918c38654ee56a4ab86022d224b8dc1/tumblr_pe38raZhEX1w15kmho1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"540\"/></figure><p>\u201cAlright Y/N, I\u2019m about to leave,\u201d Jimin yelled out as he slipped on his jacket.

You automatically shook your head which made Jimin raise his eyebrows in confusion.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me alone with Noah,\u201d you stated, which confused Jimin even more.</p><p>\u201cWhy jagiya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d you started but your voice cracked and tears began to run down your face.

However, when he peaked inside, Kinsley was inside of her crib sleeping peacefully and you were nowhere to be found. He then descended the stairs, walking into the living room. There you were, sat in your easy chair next to the window. He walked over to you, setting his hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up Y/N?\u201d He muttered, his hand moving soothingly on your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d you replied meekly, taking a second to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night,\u201d you admitted, making Yoongi sigh in disappointment.

He took your hands in his, squeezing them lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe thoughts, right?\u201d He asked and you nodded. Your post partum depression had manifested itself in anxiety and you had found yourself constantly worrying over things you would\u2019ve never given any thought to otherwise.

You closed your eyes and took a deep breath in and out, trying to get your brain to release all of the negative thoughts that you were having. You then replayed Yoongi\u2019s words in your mind a few times, before opening your eyes and looking down at Yoongi.

Your post partum depression had manifested itself in anxiety and you had found yourself constantly worrying over things you would\u2019ve never given any thought to otherwise.

You have been doing amazing, though. Berkeley and Lennox couldn&rsquo;t have a better mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; You asked meekly. Hobi tightened his arms around you as a response and you relaxed into him. A few seconds of silence passed before you spoke up again.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been doing great too Hobi.&rdquo; He smiled at your words and gave you another kiss on your head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love Y/N, so much.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>Park Jimin</b></h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;Alright Y/N, I&rsquo;m about to leave,&rdquo; Jimin yelled out as he slipped on his jacket. You quickly jogged downstairs and paced over to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said you were off work today,&rdquo; you said with a raised brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Supposed to be but Yoongi hyung asked me to come record a guide for him,&rdquo; Jimin shrugged. You automatically shook your head which made Jimin raise his eyebrows in confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave me alone with Noah,&rdquo; you stated, which confused Jimin even more.</p><p>&ldquo;Why jagiya?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; you started but your voice cracked and tears began to run down your face. Your breathing became ragged and Jimin rushed over to you, gathering you in his arms.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, deep breaths,&rdquo; he guided you, breathing deeply as an example. Jimin wasn&rsquo;t sure what you were talking about but it must&rsquo;ve been pretty bad for you to damn near have a panic attack about it. Once you had managed to become somewhat more calm, he tried again.&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deal with the crying anymore,&rdquo; you admitted.&nbsp;&ldquo;It feels like I&rsquo;m losing my mind.&rdquo; You started to cry again and Jimin hugged you tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me that you were feeling like this baby?&rdquo; Jimin wondered.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to think that I don&rsquo;t love Noah and I also didn&rsquo;t want to make you feel bad for not being able to be home more,&rdquo; you confessed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just, I figured that since you had today off, you&rsquo;d take over the reigns for a while and I could rest.&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s eyes widened in realization and he pulled back from the hug to look at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying home then,&rdquo; Jimin declared and you were about to try and stop him but he shook his head, which silenced you.&nbsp;&ldquo;You need me to help you, so I&rsquo;m going to help you. We&rsquo;re in this together, right?&rdquo; He asked and you nodded. He placed a quick peck on your lips before gathering you into a hug again.</p><h2><b>Kim Taehyung</b></h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Tae gently shut the front door as he came home from work. Rehearsals and recording have been running later than Tae would like lately, since they had a comeback approaching soon. He tiptoed up the stairs, pausing to peak into Spencer&rsquo;s room. He saw that she was sleeping peacefully in her crib which made him smile.&nbsp;</p><p>After shutting her door again, he walked to your bedroom door and slowly opened it so that he wouldn&rsquo;t wake you up. However, he was surprised to see you sitting up in bed, scrolling on your phone.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Tae,&rdquo; you smiled as you looked up from your phone. After he shut the bedroom door, he set down his bag and worked on taking off his clothes from the day.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what are you still doing up?&rdquo; He wondered as he climbed into bed with you. You set your phone on the night stand and opened your arms to him. He laid his head on your chest and you began to card your fingers through his slightly damp hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanted to wait for you,&rdquo; you muttered.&nbsp;&ldquo;Feels like we haven&rsquo;t seen each other much lately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know and I&rsquo;m sorry for that,&rdquo; he apologized.&nbsp;&ldquo;How was your day? How was Munchkin today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was good. My day was typical, taking care of her and doing chores,&rdquo; you shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she do anything new today?&rdquo; He wondered and you shook your head. You were about to say something else but he cut you off.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is she doing that ear pulling thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tae,&rdquo; you whined.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know you miss Spence but can you spend some time and talk about adult things with me?&rdquo; You ranted, which surprised Tae. He sat up on his knees and looked down at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted to know what I&rsquo;ve been missing, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a baby!&rdquo; You exclaimed.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing much has changed in a week. Do you even care about me anymore?&rdquo; Tae scoffed and grabbed your face in his hands, forcing you to look him in the eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I do. How could you even think that I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; He questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;All you want to talk about lately is the baby. What about me?&rdquo; You wondered lamely. Tae suddenly pressed a firm kiss to your lips, making you gasp in surprise. Once he pulled away, he looked at you again while caressing the side of your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Kim Y/N, I love with my whole heart. You&rsquo;re my best friend and the love of my life. Nothing will ever change that, alright?&rdquo; You nodded and he smiled at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now, what do you want to talk about? Your choice jagi.&rdquo;</p><h2><b>Jeon Jungkook</b></h2><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N, I have to head to the studio baby,&rdquo; Jungkook sighed, hoping that you wouldn&rsquo;t react the way that you had been doing the past few days.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You shrieked, rushing over to him and hugging him tightly, so tight that it almost hurt him. One of the major symptoms of your post partum depression had been extreme anxiety and you didn&rsquo;t want to be left alone with Ava as a result.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I have to,&rdquo; Jungkook said gently as he rubbed your back.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, but what if something happens? What if something happens to me, or to Ava?&rdquo; You exclaimed as you breathed heavily. Jungkook pulled back from you slightly and gave you a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you&rsquo;ve always done a great job looking after Ava. Nothing is going happen.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How do you know though?!&rdquo; You shot back, making Jungkook sigh heavily. He knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to calm you down or reassure you enough for him to be able to leave you alone.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright baby, calm down,&rdquo; he whispered, wiping away the tears that had started to fall from your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here with you, ok?&rdquo; He said and you nodded happily.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just let me call Namjoon hyung and let him know.&rdquo; You nodded once again and turned to walk out out of the room.&nbsp;<br /></p>",
