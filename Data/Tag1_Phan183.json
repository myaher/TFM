Held the day before they fly up north, it&rsquo;s an entire day just for them with little to no distractions&ndash;which is exactly what Dan needs after such an intense year.</small></p><p><small>Nothing could possibly top it.</small></p><p><small>Well. Maybe not <i>exactly </i>nothing&hellip;.</small></p><p><small><b>word count:\u00a0</b>2849</small></p><p><small>written for the lovely <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/animad\">animad</a> on ao3 as part of the christmas exchange fic fest&ndash;thank you so much for providing such lovely prompts, i had such a fun time with this! and huge thanks to <a href=\"http://lilacskylester.tumblr.com\">alexis</a> for her awesome support and for cleaning this up for me!</small></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123894\">Read on ao3</a></p><!-- more --><hr><p>If there\u2019s something Dan loves more than anything, it\u2019s traditions. Especially the ones he and Phil have built together.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, amidst the hecticness that is their lives and the holiday season, they always find time for each other. And when everything is&hellip;as <i>much </i>as it is in December, those little pockets of togetherness make all the difference.</p><p>Celebrating never has come easy to Dan. After all, when life is constantly zooming past you with no way of stopping and you\u2019re always tangled up in the <i>whys </i>of everything, it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much cause for celebration&ndash;even when the world is putting on its biggest thousand-watt smile and everyone seems to be joining in. But with a little help, these days he\u2019s finally beginning to understand that even the smallest things are worth celebrating.</p><p>Of course, it helps that Phil\u2019s always had enough festive spirit for ten people.</p><p>After nine years, Dan\u2019s just come to expect that whenever Mariah Carey comes on, Phil\u2019s gonna be pulling him up to dance with the goofiest smile and more recently, a pair of matching Auntie Roz hats. It\u2019s impossible for Dan not to grin at that, corny as it may be.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible for him not to feel a tiny stab of pride whenever he glances over at their tree, too.</p><p>Sure, maybe it\u2019s not the one that\u2019s followed them through two massive cities and varying states of happiness, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. It\u2019s every little bauble hanging off the branches, the ones they so carefully arrange every year (some of which still make Dan tear up even now) that matter the most.</p><p>It\u2019s the decorating process, long though it may be, that\u2019s burrowed its way into Dan\u2019s heart and made it that much harder to allow a camera into the equation. It\u2019s the familiarity of Phil\u2019s favourite Christmas playlist and the sharp scent of Starbucks that\u2019s accompanied the process these last few years.</p><p>It\u2019s knowing that he always has someone to share all this with, regardless of where their lives have led them that year.</p><p>What can Dan say? He\u2019s a sucker for the familiar and the comforting, he supposes.</p><p>(Or maybe he\u2019s just a sucker for Phil. It\u2019s hard to tell.)</p><p>Truthfully, though, his favorite tradition isn\u2019t any of that. As much as he loves the tree decorating, their mince pie and festive drink codexes, even Christmas shopping and their dinners with Martyn and Cornelia and Bryony and their management team, none of them hold a candle to his and Phil\u2019s private Christmas celebration.</p><p>Dan will swear he\u2019s <i>not </i>materialistic&ndash;well, he appreciates nice things but doesn\u2019t everyone?&ndash;and that it\u2019s not about the presents. And truthfully, it isn\u2019t.</p><p>Well, not entirely, anyway.</p><p>It\u2019s more about the thought that goes into those gifts and the little sparks of joy he gets from picking out Phil\u2019s presents. Giving themselves an entire day just for them before jetting (or chugging) off to their separate families sure doesn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>Even if it does make those days apart that much harder.</p><p>But it\u2019ll be different next year.</p><p>Just the thrill of that promise is enough to settle a bit of the longing that pulls at Dan\u2019s heart whenever he\u2019s forcibly reminded of that sad brown bedroom once again. Things have been getting better every year, though, however slightly&ndash;so maybe this year won\u2019t be so bad?</p><p>It\u2019s just past 3am when Dan finally slips from beneath the sheets and pads over to his wardrobe, where Phil\u2019s gifts are hidden behind some of Dan\u2019s heaviest jumpers. Like a mouse, he snatches them up, wincing at the slight crinkling of their far too colourful wrapping paper.</p><p>Inches away, Phil lets out a tiny exhale.</p><p>Dan freezes for a second, his heart banging against his chest until he remembers that it really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not like he and Phil can keep secrets from each other anyway.</p><p>But maybe it\u2019s the magic of the season bubbling up in him anyway. Sappy as it may be, Dan can\u2019t help the extra rush of love that comes with each reminder of his favourite day of the year.</p><p>Sneaking down the hallway and into the lounge, a slew of memories play before Dan\u2019s eyes. How many times has he done this very walk to nestle his carefully chosen gifts for this very person beneath their tree? In the little homes that they built together, and one that maybe wasn\u2019t theirs but sure was home to Dan when he needed one?</p><p>And&ndash;hold on a second. Is that <i>sugar </i>Dan\u2019s smelling? And chocolate?</p><p>Screw his annual custom of scouring under the tree to find his own presents. Phil\u2019s set out <i>cookies </i>for them, on a tiny round table that Dan almost tripped over! Just behind them is Dan\u2019s light box, displaying \u201cMerry Christmas Dan &lt;3\u201d in it.</p><p>Dan just stands there, clutching his chest for a few moments as he blinks back the tears that have suddenly sprouted.</p><p>This is new.</p><p>But it\u2019s the best kind of new.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dan\u2019s sliding into bed with a chocolate and cinnamon-coated tongue and a lightness in his heart. Phil sighs a little and pulls Dan close, Dan swiping the pillow Phil was previously holding and nestling it behind his head in one smooth motion.</p><p>He\u2019s unsure if Phil\u2019s actually awake or not but regardless, he whispers a \u201cThank you\u201d anyway. Phil\u2019s lips curl up in the softest of smiles and with that, Dan snuggles even closer, closing his eyes as memories of their Christmases together dance in his head.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>For a little while after he wakes up, Dan completely forgets what day it is. That\u2019s easy to do when last night\u2019s sweetness has completely washed off his tongue.</p><p>But a few minutes into his morning Twitter scroll, Phil grabs his arm with wide eyes and the absolute cutest grin and just like that, a bit of the magic flows back into Dan.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil says, his voice just above a whisper. \u201cDandandan, don\u2019t tell me you forgot what today is!\u201d</p><p>Dan just answers with a kiss to Phil\u2019s cheek and an extra soft squeeze. \u201c\u2018Course not. Merry almost Christmas, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Dan.\u201d</p><p>They stay there for a few moments, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, drinking in the brilliant white sky streaming through the crack in the shades. Dan allows his lips to trace over some of his favourite parts of Phil, soft and lingering, until Phil starts squirming just a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for present time, babe?\u201d Dan giggles.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm, I was <i>born </i>ready,\u201d Phil counters. \u201cJust wait till you see what I got you. You\u2019re gonna die, sir Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a threat now, is it?\u201d Dan says, running his eyes all over Phil, a smirk dancing at the edges of his lips. \u201cWell. We\u2019ll see about that, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>And he slinks out of the room, heading down to the kitchen&ndash;but not before giving Phil\u2019s ass a deft pinch, of course.</p><p>It is their Christmas, after all.</p><p>Their coffee routine becomes a languid affair that morning. Despite this, there\u2019s still an inexplicable unease fluttering in the dark recesses of Dan\u2019s mind.</p><p>So he takes some slightly deeper breaths, forces himself to focus on things he can see and hear, like the soft hum of the microwave as it heats up the water for Phil\u2019s instant coffee and the way the sun makes little diamonds on the shelves when Dan opens the cupboards.</p><p>Then there\u2019s a pair of arms wrapping around his bare chest and hair tickling at his neck and <i>ohhhh </i>is that nice.</p><p>Dan instantly melts into the touch. He twists around slowly, his face a giant question mark. But Phil just smiles and presses a kiss beneath Dan\u2019s ear before detaching and settling himself at the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Phil says, once they\u2019re both seated with steaming festive mugs and identical bowls of cereal. \u201cI\u2019m quite glad we\u2019re doing this today, instead of at my mum and dad\u2019s like last year. I kinda missed having our own gift exchange.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes his time chewing his next spoonful, really allowing the Crunchy Nut and almond milk to wash over his tongue before finally swallowing. \u201cYeah. I mean, as amazing as that was, I\u2019m still not used to people giving a fuss over what we got each other. Well, besides\u2026. you know. But I really like it being our thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Phil mumbles around his next mouthful.</p><p>Dan just smiles down into his bowl.</p><p>It really is nice having some things just for them.</p><p>A few minutes of companionable silence pass, then Phil\u2019s cold toes are suddenly tapping against Dan\u2019s leg. \u201cHey. Hey. Hey. You saw the tree last night, right? Or, well, you saw what was by it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god </i>Phil, put some slippers on or something. Your toes are like giant ice cubes!\u201d Dan protests.</p><p>Phil just makes a face. Of course it\u2019s nothing but soft. \u201cFiiiiiine. But did you see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I saw it, you spoon,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me say thank you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Phil shakes his head a little. \u201cI may remember something about that. Hard to say, though.\u201d</p><p>Dan has half a mind to lean over and kiss the gleeful smirk off Phil\u2019s lips. He very nearly leans in too, but chooses to grab his mug and roll his eyes instead. \u201cWell, in any case. Thank you again. It really was a lovely 3am surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not even gonna bother commenting on that bedtime. Merry Christmas,\u201d Phil giggles.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dan says, suddenly noticing the now-empty bowls and mugs before them. \u201cOh hey,\u201d he adds. \u201cI believe I was promised death by presents today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Don\u2019t sound so excited there, mate.\u201d But Phil\u2019s smiling as he pushes himself out of his seat anyway.</p><p>Five minutes later, they\u2019re both wearing their comfiest pajamas and sitting on the hardwood floor in front of the tree. Up in the lounge, it may not appear quite as magical as it did last night, but Dan doesn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s any less special, not with Phil here.</p><p>\u201cYou left some of the cookies? Awww, Dan. Thank you!\u201d</p><p>Of course the minute Dan turns to face him, Phil\u2019s already stuffing a chocolate chip cookie in his mouth with a massive grin, a deformed gingerbread man dangling from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI figured they were for today anyway,\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut can I <i>pleaseeee </i>give you your gifts first? I got some really good ones this year. Please, Phil?\u201d He pulls out his best doe eyes, doing everything in his power to fight the smile that\u2019s just dying to take over his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>fine</i>. But you better not be sneking me. I know your sneking face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sneks here, I promise.\u201d Dan bats his eyes while pulling his smallest box from under the tree. \u201cThis one first!\u201d</p><p>Phil just shoots him the fondest of side eyes while Dan folds his hands in his lap to hopefully keep his fingers from tapping excessively.</p><p>Within seconds, Phil\u2019s already ripped into the parcel to find\u2026.</p><p>\u201cDan!!! You said you weren\u2019t gonna snek me!!\u201d</p><p>He leans over to smack Dan in the arm with the small white box of hair regrowth treatment, his teasing smirk only growing bigger as they both dissolve in laughter loud enough to fill the entire building. (Alright, maybe that\u2019s just Dan. But judging by the deep crinkles near Phil\u2019s eyes, he loves it anyway.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a snek! It\u2019s an <i>investment</i>,\u201d Dan protests, snatching the wrapping paper off the ground in a futile attempt to defend himself.</p><p>Phil just stares at it in amusement for a few seconds before shaking his head and dropping the box to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Phil sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is our tenth Christmas together.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, those words are enough to melt some of Dan\u2019s playfulness into pure fondness. \u201cGod. It is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a few seconds of comfortable silence as they each gaze down at the floor, then back at each other with softened eyes and deep smiles. Something sharp tugs at Dan\u2019s heart but he lets it be.</p><p>They\u2019ve both come a long way from their terrified 18 and 22 year old selves. Yet Dan wouldn\u2019t trade that first Christmas together for the world.</p><p>He can\u2019t let himself get too soft, though, so he pulls a long rectangular parcel from the stash. \u201cOkay, I <i>promise </i>this one isn\u2019t a snek. It actually may be my favourite of the three.\u201d</p><p>It really is. This is the one he spent the most time on, the one he spent so many hours tweaking until it perfectly captured their last year together. It has the most <i>Dan </i>in it than either of the others.</p><p>Phil just side eyes him again, then snatches up the gift and rips it open anyway.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan</i>. Oh my god, you didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s voice is a near whisper, soft as candlelight and just as sweet. His eyes are positively reverential as he runs a finger over the raised letters on the cover of the photo album.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. You know I can\u2019t allow our tour memories to only live inside our phones. Just, uhhhh\u2026.\u201d Dan pauses as Phil slowly opens the front cover, \u201cignore that smudge right there, I kinda forgot I was cursed for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Phil\u2019s eyes go straight to the barely legible message but he just giggles sweetly. \u201cI love it anyway. This is getting a special place of honour in the forever home. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dan beams.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Phil says after a few moments, \u201cyou got any more or can I give you yours now? Pleaaaseeee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, not so fast there, Lester,\u201d Dan says, pulling out a tall, brightly wrapped box. \u201cAs a matter of fact, there is one more. It\u2019s kinda our new tradition, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Phil\u2019s face lights up, his smile growing even deeper when he finally rips apart the paper and opens the smooth white box.</p><p>Inside is a candle, but it\u2019s not just any candle. Much like the deer Dan got him a couple years ago, this one is green and shaped like a dragon&ndash;well, if dragons could sit on their butts like dogs anyway. Phil runs his fingers over and over the scales, his lips slightly parted. The adorableness is enough to make Dan\u2019s heart burst.</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2026. how do you always find the <i>coolest </i>things? I almost don\u2019t wanna burn this now, it\u2019s too pretty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it, though? I thought it would look amazing in the lounge of the new place, maybe even next to the tour album,\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut hey, more importantly, are you gonna name it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmmmm, I think I\u2019ll wait for a name to come to me,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m way way way too excited to see you open yours. You\u2019re gonna love it, I know it!!\u201d And he shoves a messily wrapped square box into Dan\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never gonna learn to wrap, are you?\u201d Dan teases. Unlike Phil, he takes his time carefully peeling at each piece of tape and reveling in Phil\u2019s squirming.</p><p>\u201cHey, I did an amazing job wrapping that! But come <i>onnnnnn</i>, I\u2019m gonna go old and grey just watching you open it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you the hair regrowing stuff was a good investment!\u201d Dan laughs. \u201cNow, for your information&ndash;\u201d His next words are cut off as he finally pulls the short black box out of the paper and lifts up the top.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, <i>Phil</i>. This\u2026. I\u2026. fuck.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, time stops as Dan rolls the gorgeous candle between his hands (it\u2019s <i>heavy </i>too, much heavier than it looks) and gazes down at all the little black squares so perfectly placed on the snowy white surface. He tilts it toward the tree, where a burst of colour suddenly dances over the pot. So not only is it the most gorgeous thing he\u2019s ever seen&ndash;well, second most gorgeous&ndash;but the black specks are <i>reflective </i>too?</p><p>It\u2019s too much. Dan may actually explode.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I\u2026.\u201d he stutters, voice breaking as he regains the power of speech. \u201cThis is the most beautiful thing anyone has ever given me. Thank you. I love it so so so much. I love <i>you </i>so damn much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Dan,\u201d Phil answers simply.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Dan whispers back before leaning in to press the softest of kisses to Phil\u2019s lips. He\u2019s shocked to find his eyes are wet when he pulls away.</p><p>It hits him all at once. In that moment, <i>finally</i>, Dan has all he\u2019ll ever need.</p><p>It\u2019s a beautiful feeling. Intoxicating, even. Maybe not as beautiful as the candle (which smells incredible too of course&ndash; <i>how </i>Phil found something this perfect is a mystery to Dan yet maybe that\u2019s just part of the magic), but it\u2019s so much more than Dan could ever ask for.</p><p>And isn\u2019t that what Christmas is all about?</p>",

Especially the ones he and Phil have built together.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, amidst the hecticness that is their lives and the holiday season, they always find time for each other. And when everything is\u2026as <i>much </i>as it is in December, those little pockets of togetherness make all the difference.</p><p>Celebrating never has come easy to Dan. After all, when life is constantly zooming past you with no way of stopping and you\u2019re always tangled up in the <i>whys </i>of everything, it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much cause for celebration\u2013even when the world is putting on its biggest thousand-watt smile and everyone seems to be joining in. But with a little help, these days he\u2019s finally beginning to understand that even the smallest things are worth celebrating.</p><p>Of course, it helps that Phil\u2019s always had enough festive spirit for ten people.</p><p>After nine years, Dan\u2019s just come to expect that whenever Mariah Carey comes on, Phil\u2019s gonna be pulling him up to dance with the goofiest smile and more recently, a pair of matching Auntie Roz hats. It\u2019s impossible for Dan not to grin at that, corny as it may be.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible for him not to feel a tiny stab of pride whenever he glances over at their tree, too.</p><p>Sure, maybe it\u2019s not the one that\u2019s followed them through two massive cities and varying states of happiness, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. It\u2019s every little bauble hanging off the branches, the ones they so carefully arrange every year (some of which still make Dan tear up even now) that matter the most.</p><p>It\u2019s the decorating process, long though it may be, that\u2019s burrowed its way into Dan\u2019s heart and made it that much harder to allow a camera into the equation. It\u2019s the familiarity of Phil\u2019s favourite Christmas playlist and the sharp scent of Starbucks that\u2019s accompanied the process these last few years.</p><p>It\u2019s knowing that he always has someone to share all this with, regardless of where their lives have led them that year.</p><p>What can Dan say? He\u2019s a sucker for the familiar and the comforting, he supposes.</p><p>(Or maybe he\u2019s just a sucker for Phil. It\u2019s hard to tell.)</p><p>Truthfully, though, his favorite tradition isn\u2019t any of that. As much as he loves the tree decorating, their mince pie and festive drink codexes, even Christmas shopping and their dinners with Martyn and Cornelia and Bryony and their management team, none of them hold a candle to his and Phil\u2019s private Christmas celebration.</p><p>Dan will swear he\u2019s <i>not </i>materialistic\u2013well, he appreciates nice things but doesn\u2019t everyone?\u2013and that it\u2019s not about the presents. And truthfully, it isn\u2019t.</p><p>Well, not entirely, anyway.</p><p>It\u2019s more about the thought that goes into those gifts and the little sparks of joy he gets from picking out Phil\u2019s presents. Giving themselves an entire day just for them before jetting (or chugging) off to their separate families sure doesn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>Even if it does make those days apart that much harder.</p><p>But it\u2019ll be different next year.</p><p>Just the thrill of that promise is enough to settle a bit of the longing that pulls at Dan\u2019s heart whenever he\u2019s forcibly reminded of that sad brown bedroom once again. Things have been getting better every year, though, however slightly\u2013so maybe this year won\u2019t be so bad?</p><p>It\u2019s just past 3am when Dan finally slips from beneath the sheets and pads over to his wardrobe, where Phil\u2019s gifts are hidden behind some of Dan\u2019s heaviest jumpers. Like a mouse, he snatches them up, wincing at the slight crinkling of their far too colourful wrapping paper.</p><p>Inches away, Phil lets out a tiny exhale.</p><p>Dan freezes for a second, his heart banging against his chest until he remembers that it really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not like he and Phil can keep secrets from each other anyway.</p><p>But maybe it\u2019s the magic of the season bubbling up in him anyway. Sappy as it may be, Dan can\u2019t help the extra rush of love that comes with each reminder of his favourite day of the year.</p><p>Sneaking down the hallway and into the lounge, a slew of memories play before Dan\u2019s eyes. How many times has he done this very walk to nestle his carefully chosen gifts for this very person beneath their tree? In the little homes that they built together, and one that maybe wasn\u2019t theirs but sure was home to Dan when he needed one?</p><p>And\u2013hold on a second. Is that <i>sugar </i>Dan\u2019s smelling? And chocolate?</p><p>Screw his annual custom of scouring under the tree to find his own presents. Phil\u2019s set out <i>cookies </i>for them, on a tiny round table that Dan almost tripped over! Just behind them is Dan\u2019s light box, displaying \u201cMerry Christmas Dan &lt;3\u201d in it.</p><p>Dan just stands there, clutching his chest for a few moments as he blinks back the tears that have suddenly sprouted.</p><p>This is new.</p><p>But it\u2019s the best kind of new.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dan\u2019s sliding into bed with a chocolate and cinnamon-coated tongue and a lightness in his heart. Phil sighs a little and pulls Dan close, Dan swiping the pillow Phil was previously holding and nestling it behind his head in one smooth motion.</p><p>He\u2019s unsure if Phil\u2019s actually awake or not but regardless, he whispers a \u201cThank you\u201d anyway. Phil\u2019s lips curl up in the softest of smiles and with that, Dan snuggles even closer, closing his eyes as memories of their Christmases together dance in his head.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>For a little while after he wakes up, Dan completely forgets what day it is. That\u2019s easy to do when last night\u2019s sweetness has completely washed off his tongue.</p><p>But a few minutes into his morning Twitter scroll, Phil grabs his arm with wide eyes and the absolute cutest grin and just like that, a bit of the magic flows back into Dan.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil says, his voice just above a whisper. \u201cDandandan, don\u2019t tell me you forgot what today is!\u201d</p><p>Dan just answers with a kiss to Phil\u2019s cheek and an extra soft squeeze. \u201c\u2018Course not. Merry almost Christmas, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Dan.\u201d</p><p>They stay there for a few moments, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, drinking in the brilliant white sky streaming through the crack in the shades. Dan allows his lips to trace over some of his favourite parts of Phil, soft and lingering, until Phil starts squirming just a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for present time, babe?\u201d Dan giggles.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm, I was <i>born </i>ready,\u201d Phil counters. \u201cJust wait till you see what I got you. You\u2019re gonna die, sir Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a threat now, is it?\u201d Dan says, running his eyes all over Phil, a smirk dancing at the edges of his lips. \u201cWell. We\u2019ll see about that, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>And he slinks out of the room, heading down to the kitchen\u2013but not before giving Phil\u2019s ass a deft pinch, of course.</p><p>It is their Christmas, after all.</p><p>Their coffee routine becomes a languid affair that morning. Despite this, there\u2019s still an inexplicable unease fluttering in the dark recesses of Dan\u2019s mind.</p><p>So he takes some slightly deeper breaths, forces himself to focus on things he can see and hear, like the soft hum of the microwave as it heats up the water for Phil\u2019s instant coffee and the way the sun makes little diamonds on the shelves when Dan opens the cupboards.</p><p>Then there\u2019s a pair of arms wrapping around his bare chest and hair tickling at his neck and <i>ohhhh </i>is that nice.</p><p>Dan instantly melts into the touch. He twists around slowly, his face a giant question mark. But Phil just smiles and presses a kiss beneath Dan\u2019s ear before detaching and settling himself at the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Phil says, once they\u2019re both seated with steaming festive mugs and identical bowls of cereal. \u201cI\u2019m quite glad we\u2019re doing this today, instead of at my mum and dad\u2019s like last year. I kinda missed having our own gift exchange.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes his time chewing his next spoonful, really allowing the Crunchy Nut and almond milk to wash over his tongue before finally swallowing. \u201cYeah. I mean, as amazing as that was, I\u2019m still not used to people giving a fuss over what we got each other. Well, besides\u2026. you know. But I really like it being our thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Phil mumbles around his next mouthful.</p><p>Dan just smiles down into his bowl.</p><p>It really is nice having some things just for them.</p><p>A few minutes of companionable silence pass, then Phil\u2019s cold toes are suddenly tapping against Dan\u2019s leg. \u201cHey. Hey. Hey. You saw the tree last night, right? Or, well, you saw what was by it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god </i>Phil, put some slippers on or something. Your toes are like giant ice cubes!\u201d Dan protests.</p><p>Phil just makes a face. Of course it\u2019s nothing but soft. \u201cFiiiiiine. But did you see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I saw it, you spoon,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me say thank you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Phil shakes his head a little. \u201cI may remember something about that. Hard to say, though.\u201d</p><p>Dan has half a mind to lean over and kiss the gleeful smirk off Phil\u2019s lips. He very nearly leans in too, but chooses to grab his mug and roll his eyes instead. \u201cWell, in any case. Thank you again. It really was a lovely 3am surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not even gonna bother commenting on that bedtime. Merry Christmas,\u201d Phil giggles.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dan says, suddenly noticing the now-empty bowls and mugs before them. \u201cOh hey,\u201d he adds. \u201cI believe I was promised death by presents today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Don\u2019t sound so excited there, mate.\u201d But Phil\u2019s smiling as he pushes himself out of his seat anyway.</p><p>Five minutes later, they\u2019re both wearing their comfiest pajamas and sitting on the hardwood floor in front of the tree.

(Alright, maybe that\u2019s just Dan. But judging by the deep crinkles near Phil\u2019s eyes, he loves it anyway.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a snek! It\u2019s an <i>investment</i>,\u201d Dan protests, snatching the wrapping paper off the ground in a futile attempt to defend himself.</p><p>Phil just stares at it in amusement for a few seconds before shaking his head and dropping the box to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Phil sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is our tenth Christmas together.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, those words are enough to melt some of Dan\u2019s playfulness into pure fondness. \u201cGod. It is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a few seconds of comfortable silence as they each gaze down at the floor, then back at each other with softened eyes and deep smiles.

This is the one he spent the most time on, the one he spent so many hours tweaking until it perfectly captured their last year together. It has the most <i>Dan </i>in it than either of the others.</p><p>Phil just side eyes him again, then snatches up the gift and rips it open anyway.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan</i>. Oh my god, you didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s voice is a near whisper, soft as candlelight and just as sweet. His eyes are positively reverential as he runs a finger over the raised letters on the cover of the photo album.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. You know I can\u2019t allow our tour memories to only live inside our phones. Just, uhhhh\u2026.\u201d Dan pauses as Phil slowly opens the front cover, \u201cignore that smudge right there, I kinda forgot I was cursed for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Phil\u2019s eyes go straight to the barely legible message but he just giggles sweetly. \u201cI love it anyway. This is getting a special place of honour in the forever home. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dan beams.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Phil says after a few moments, \u201cyou got any more or can I give you yours now? Pleaaaseeee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, not so fast there, Lester,\u201d Dan says, pulling out a tall, brightly wrapped box. \u201cAs a matter of fact, there is one more. It\u2019s kinda our new tradition, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Phil\u2019s face lights up, his smile growing even deeper when he finally rips apart the paper and opens the smooth white box.</p><p>Inside is a candle, but it\u2019s not just any candle. Much like the deer Dan got him a couple years ago, this one is green and shaped like a dragon\u2013well, if dragons could sit on their butts like dogs anyway. Phil runs his fingers over and over the scales, his lips slightly parted. The adorableness is enough to make Dan\u2019s heart burst.</p><p>\u201cDan, I\u2026. how do you always find the <i>coolest </i>things? I almost don\u2019t wanna burn this now, it\u2019s too pretty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it, though? I thought it would look amazing in the lounge of the new place, maybe even next to the tour album,\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut hey, more importantly, are you gonna name it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmmmm, I think I\u2019ll wait for a name to come to me,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019m way way way too excited to see you open yours. You\u2019re gonna love it, I know it!!\u201d And he shoves a messily wrapped square box into Dan\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never gonna learn to wrap, are you?\u201d Dan teases. Unlike Phil, he takes his time carefully peeling at each piece of tape and reveling in Phil\u2019s squirming.</p><p>\u201cHey, I did an amazing job wrapping that! But come <i>onnnnnn</i>, I\u2019m gonna go old and grey just watching you open it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you the hair regrowing stuff was a good investment!\u201d Dan laughs. \u201cNow, for your information\u2013\u201d His next words are cut off as he finally pulls the short black box out of the paper and lifts up the top.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, <i>Phil</i>. This\u2026. I\u2026. fuck.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, time stops as Dan rolls the gorgeous candle between his hands (it\u2019s <i>heavy </i>too, much heavier than it looks) and gazes down at all the little black squares so perfectly placed on the snowy white surface. He tilts it toward the tree, where a burst of colour suddenly dances over the pot. So not only is it the most gorgeous thing he\u2019s ever seen\u2013well, second most gorgeous\u2013but the black specks are <i>reflective </i>too?</p><p>It\u2019s too much. Dan may actually explode.</p><p>\u201cPhil, I\u2026.\u201d he stutters, voice breaking as he regains the power of speech. \u201cThis is the most beautiful thing anyone has ever given me. Thank you. I love it so so so much. I love <i>you </i>so damn much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Dan,\u201d Phil answers simply.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Dan whispers back before leaning in to press the softest of kisses to Phil\u2019s lips. He\u2019s shocked to find his eyes are wet when he pulls away.</p><p>It hits him all at once. In that moment, <i>finally</i>, Dan has all he\u2019ll ever need.</p><p>It\u2019s a beautiful feeling. Intoxicating, even. Maybe not as beautiful as the candle (which smells incredible too of course\u2013 <i>how </i>Phil found something this perfect is a mystery to Dan yet maybe that\u2019s just part of the magic), but it\u2019s so much more than Dan could ever ask for.</p><p>And isn\u2019t that what Christmas is all about?</p>",

Held the day before they fly up north, it\u2019s an entire day just for them with little to no distractions\u2013which is exactly what Dan needs after such an intense year.</small></p><p><small>Nothing could possibly top it.</small></p><p><small>Well. Maybe not <i>exactly </i>nothing\u2026.</small></p><p><small><b>word count:\u00a0</b>2849</small></p><p><small>written for the lovely <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/animad\">animad</a> on ao3 as part of the christmas exchange fic fest\u2013thank you so much for providing such lovely prompts, i had such a fun time with this! and huge thanks to <a href=\"http://lilacskylester.tumblr.com\">alexis</a> for her awesome support and for cleaning this up for me!</small></p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17123894\">Read on ao3</a></p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>If there\u2019s something Dan loves more than anything, it\u2019s traditions. Especially the ones he and Phil have built together.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, amidst the hecticness that is their lives and the holiday season, they always find time for each other. And when everything is\u2026as <i>much </i>as it is in December, those little pockets of togetherness make all the difference.</p><p>Celebrating never has come easy to Dan. After all, when life is constantly zooming past you with no way of stopping and you\u2019re always tangled up in the <i>whys </i>of everything, it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much cause for celebration\u2013even when the world is putting on its biggest thousand-watt smile and everyone seems to be joining in. But with a little help, these days he\u2019s finally beginning to understand that even the smallest things are worth celebrating.</p><p>Of course, it helps that Phil\u2019s always had enough festive spirit for ten people.</p><p>After nine years, Dan\u2019s just come to expect that whenever Mariah Carey comes on, Phil\u2019s gonna be pulling him up to dance with the goofiest smile and more recently, a pair of matching Auntie Roz hats. It\u2019s impossible for Dan not to grin at that, corny as it may be.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible for him not to feel a tiny stab of pride whenever he glances over at their tree, too.</p><p>Sure, maybe it\u2019s not the one that\u2019s followed them through two massive cities and varying states of happiness, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. It\u2019s every little bauble hanging off the branches, the ones they so carefully arrange every year (some of which still make Dan tear up even now) that matter the most.</p><p>It\u2019s the decorating process, long though it may be, that\u2019s burrowed its way into Dan\u2019s heart and made it that much harder to allow a camera into the equation. It\u2019s the familiarity of Phil\u2019s favourite Christmas playlist and the sharp scent of Starbucks that\u2019s accompanied the process these last few years.</p><p>It\u2019s knowing that he always has someone to share all this with, regardless of where their lives have led them that year.</p><p>What can Dan say? He\u2019s a sucker for the familiar and the comforting, he supposes.</p><p>(Or maybe he\u2019s just a sucker for Phil. It\u2019s hard to tell.)</p><p>Truthfully, though, his favorite tradition isn\u2019t any of that. As much as he loves the tree decorating, their mince pie and festive drink codexes, even Christmas shopping and their dinners with Martyn and Cornelia and Bryony and their management team, none of them hold a candle to his and Phil\u2019s private Christmas celebration.</p><p>Dan will swear he\u2019s <i>not </i>materialistic\u2013well, he appreciates nice things but doesn\u2019t everyone?\u2013and that it\u2019s not about the presents. And truthfully, it isn\u2019t.</p><p>Well, not entirely, anyway.</p><p>It\u2019s more about the thought that goes into those gifts and the little sparks of joy he gets from picking out Phil\u2019s presents. Giving themselves an entire day just for them before jetting (or chugging) off to their separate families sure doesn\u2019t hurt either.</p><p>Even if it does make those days apart that much harder.</p><p>But it\u2019ll be different next year.</p><p>Just the thrill of that promise is enough to settle a bit of the longing that pulls at Dan\u2019s heart whenever he\u2019s forcibly reminded of that sad brown bedroom once again. Things have been getting better every year, though, however slightly\u2013so maybe this year won\u2019t be so bad?</p><p>It\u2019s just past 3am when Dan finally slips from beneath the sheets and pads over to his wardrobe, where Phil\u2019s gifts are hidden behind some of Dan\u2019s heaviest jumpers. Like a mouse, he snatches them up, wincing at the slight crinkling of their far too colourful wrapping paper.</p><p>Inches away, Phil lets out a tiny exhale.</p><p>Dan freezes for a second, his heart banging against his chest until he remembers that it really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not like he and Phil can keep secrets from each other anyway.</p><p>But maybe it\u2019s the magic of the season bubbling up in him anyway. Sappy as it may be, Dan can\u2019t help the extra rush of love that comes with each reminder of his favourite day of the year.</p><p>Sneaking down the hallway and into the lounge, a slew of memories play before Dan\u2019s eyes. How many times has he done this very walk to nestle his carefully chosen gifts for this very person beneath their tree? In the little homes that they built together, and one that maybe wasn\u2019t theirs but sure was home to Dan when he needed one?</p><p>And\u2013hold on a second. Is that <i>sugar </i>Dan\u2019s smelling? And chocolate?</p><p>Screw his annual custom of scouring under the tree to find his own presents. Phil\u2019s set out <i>cookies </i>for them, on a tiny round table that Dan almost tripped over! Just behind them is Dan\u2019s light box, displaying \u201cMerry Christmas Dan &lt;3\u201d in it.</p><p>Dan just stands there, clutching his chest for a few moments as he blinks back the tears that have suddenly sprouted.</p><p>This is new.</p><p>But it\u2019s the best kind of new.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dan\u2019s sliding into bed with a chocolate and cinnamon-coated tongue and a lightness in his heart. Phil sighs a little and pulls Dan close, Dan swiping the pillow Phil was previously holding and nestling it behind his head in one smooth motion.</p><p>He\u2019s unsure if Phil\u2019s actually awake or not but regardless, he whispers a \u201cThank you\u201d anyway. Phil\u2019s lips curl up in the softest of smiles and with that, Dan snuggles even closer, closing his eyes as memories of their Christmases together dance in his head.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>For a little while after he wakes up, Dan completely forgets what day it is. That\u2019s easy to do when last night\u2019s sweetness has completely washed off his tongue.</p><p>But a few minutes into his morning Twitter scroll, Phil grabs his arm with wide eyes and the absolute cutest grin and just like that, a bit of the magic flows back into Dan.</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil says, his voice just above a whisper. \u201cDandandan, don\u2019t tell me you forgot what today is!\u201d</p><p>Dan just answers with a kiss to Phil\u2019s cheek and an extra soft squeeze. \u201c\u2018Course not. Merry almost Christmas, Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Dan.\u201d</p><p>They stay there for a few moments, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, drinking in the brilliant white sky streaming through the crack in the shades. Dan allows his lips to trace over some of his favourite parts of Phil, soft and lingering, until Phil starts squirming just a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for present time, babe?\u201d Dan giggles.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm, I was <i>born </i>ready,\u201d Phil counters. \u201cJust wait till you see what I got you. You\u2019re gonna die, sir Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a threat now, is it?\u201d Dan says, running his eyes all over Phil, a smirk dancing at the edges of his lips. \u201cWell. We\u2019ll see about that, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>And he slinks out of the room, heading down to the kitchen\u2013but not before giving Phil\u2019s ass a deft pinch, of course.</p><p>It is their Christmas, after all.</p><p>Their coffee routine becomes a languid affair that morning. Despite this, there\u2019s still an inexplicable unease fluttering in the dark recesses of Dan\u2019s mind.</p><p>So he takes some slightly deeper breaths, forces himself to focus on things he can see and hear, like the soft hum of the microwave as it heats up the water for Phil\u2019s instant coffee and the way the sun makes little diamonds on the shelves when Dan opens the cupboards.</p><p>Then there\u2019s a pair of arms wrapping around his bare chest and hair tickling at his neck and <i>ohhhh </i>is that nice.</p><p>Dan instantly melts into the touch. He twists around slowly, his face a giant question mark. But Phil just smiles and presses a kiss beneath Dan\u2019s ear before detaching and settling himself at the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Phil says, once they\u2019re both seated with steaming festive mugs and identical bowls of cereal. \u201cI\u2019m quite glad we\u2019re doing this today, instead of at my mum and dad\u2019s like last year. I kinda missed having our own gift exchange.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes his time chewing his next spoonful, really allowing the Crunchy Nut and almond milk to wash over his tongue before finally swallowing. \u201cYeah. I mean, as amazing as that was, I\u2019m still not used to people giving a fuss over what we got each other. Well, besides\u2026. you know. But I really like it being our thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Phil mumbles around his next mouthful.</p><p>Dan just smiles down into his bowl.</p><p>It really is nice having some things just for them.</p><p>A few minutes of companionable silence pass, then Phil\u2019s cold toes are suddenly tapping against Dan\u2019s leg. \u201cHey. Hey. Hey. You saw the tree last night, right? Or, well, you saw what was by it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god </i>Phil, put some slippers on or something. Your toes are like giant ice cubes!\u201d Dan protests.</p><p>Phil just makes a face. Of course it\u2019s nothing but soft. \u201cFiiiiiine. But did you see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I saw it, you spoon,\u201d Dan says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me say thank you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Phil shakes his head a little. \u201cI may remember something about that. Hard to say, though.\u201d</p><p>Dan has half a mind to lean over and kiss the gleeful smirk off Phil\u2019s lips. He very nearly leans in too, but chooses to grab his mug and roll his eyes instead. \u201cWell, in any case. Thank you again. It really was a lovely 3am surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not even gonna bother commenting on that bedtime. Merry Christmas,\u201d Phil giggles.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dan says, suddenly noticing the now-empty bowls and mugs before them. \u201cOh hey,\u201d he adds. \u201cI believe I was promised death by presents today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Don\u2019t sound so excited there, mate.\u201d But Phil\u2019s smiling as he pushes himself out of his seat anyway.</p><p>Five minutes later, they\u2019re both wearing their comfiest pajamas and sitting on the hardwood floor in front of the tree. Up in the lounge, it may not appear quite as magical as it did last night, but Dan doesn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s any less special, not with Phil here.</p><p>\u201cYou left some of the cookies? Awww, Dan. Thank you!\u201d</p><p>Of course the minute Dan turns to face him, Phil\u2019s already stuffing a chocolate chip cookie in his mouth with a massive grin, a deformed gingerbread man dangling from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI figured they were for today anyway,\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut can I <i>pleaseeee </i>give you your gifts first? I got some really good ones this year. Please, Phil?\u201d He pulls out his best doe eyes, doing everything in his power to fight the smile that\u2019s just dying to take over his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, <i>fine</i>. But you better not be sneking me. I know your sneking face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sneks here, I promise.\u201d Dan bats his eyes while pulling his smallest box from under the tree. \u201cThis one first!\u201d</p><p>Phil just shoots him the fondest of side eyes while Dan folds his hands in his lap to hopefully keep his fingers from tapping excessively.</p><p>Within seconds, Phil\u2019s already ripped into the parcel to find\u2026.</p><p>\u201cDan!!! You said you weren\u2019t gonna snek me!!\u201d</p><p>He leans over to smack Dan in the arm with the small white box of hair regrowth treatment, his teasing smirk only growing bigger as they both dissolve in laughter loud enough to fill the entire building. (Alright, maybe that\u2019s just Dan. But judging by the deep crinkles near Phil\u2019s eyes, he loves it anyway.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a snek! It\u2019s an <i>investment</i>,\u201d Dan protests, snatching the wrapping paper off the ground in a futile attempt to defend himself.</p><p>Phil just stares at it in amusement for a few seconds before shaking his head and dropping the box to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Phil sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is our tenth Christmas together.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, those words are enough to melt some of Dan\u2019s playfulness into pure fondness. \u201cGod. It is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a few seconds of comfortable silence as they each gaze down at the floor, then back at each other with softened eyes and deep smiles. Something sharp tugs at Dan\u2019s heart but he lets it be.</p><p>They\u2019ve both come a long way from their terrified 18 and 22 year old selves. Yet Dan wouldn\u2019t trade that first Christmas together for the world.</p><p>He can\u2019t let himself get too soft, though, so he pulls a long rectangular parcel from the stash. \u201cOkay, I <i>promise </i>this one isn\u2019t a snek. It actually may be my favourite of the three.\u201d</p><p>It really is. This is the one he spent the most time on, the one he spent so many hours tweaking until it perfectly captured their last year together. It has the most <i>Dan </i>in it than either of the others.</p><p>Phil just side eyes him again, then snatches up the gift and rips it open anyway.</p><p>\u201c<i>Dan</i>. Oh my god, you didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s voice is a near whisper, soft as candlelight and just as sweet. His eyes are positively reverential as he runs a finger over the raised letters on the cover of the photo album.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. You know I can\u2019t allow our tour memories to only live inside our phones. Just, uhhhh\u2026.\u201d Dan pauses as Phil slowly opens the front cover, \u201cignore that smudge right there, I kinda forgot I was cursed for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>Of course, Phil\u2019s eyes go straight to the barely legible message but he just giggles sweetly. \u201cI love it anyway. This is getting a special place of honour in the forever home. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dan beams.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Phil says after a few moments, \u201cyou got any more or can I give you yours now? Pleaaaseeee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, not so fast there, Lester,\u201d Dan says, pulling out a tall, brightly wrapped box. \u201cAs a matter of fact, there is one more. It\u2019s kinda our new tradition, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Phil\u2019s face lights up, his smile growing even deeper when he finally rips apart the paper and opens the smooth white box.</p><p>Inside is a candle, but it\u2019s not just any candle. Much like the deer Dan got him a couple years ago, this one is green and shaped like a dragon\u2013well, if dragons could sit on their butts like dogs anyway. Phil runs his fingers over and over the scales, his lips slightly parted.

Especially the ones he and Phil have built together.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, amidst the hecticness that is their lives and the holiday season, they always find time for each other. And when everything is&hellip;as <i>much </i>as it is in December, those little pockets of togetherness make all the difference.</p><p>Celebrating never has come easy to Dan. After all, when life is constantly zooming past you with no way of stopping and you&rsquo;re always tangled up in the <i>whys </i>of everything, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s much cause for celebration&ndash;even when the world is putting on its biggest thousand-watt smile and everyone seems to be joining in. But with a little help, these days he&rsquo;s finally beginning to understand that even the smallest things are worth celebrating.</p><p>Of course, it helps that Phil&rsquo;s always had enough festive spirit for ten people.</p><p>After nine years, Dan&rsquo;s just come to expect that whenever Mariah Carey comes on, Phil&rsquo;s gonna be pulling him up to dance with the goofiest smile and more recently, a pair of matching Auntie Roz hats. It&rsquo;s impossible for Dan not to grin at that, corny as it may be.</p><p>It&rsquo;s impossible for him not to feel a tiny stab of pride whenever he glances over at their tree, too.</p><p>Sure, maybe it&rsquo;s not the one that&rsquo;s followed them through two massive cities and varying states of happiness, but that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s important. It&rsquo;s every little bauble hanging off the branches, the ones they so carefully arrange every year (some of which still make Dan tear up even now) that matter the most.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the decorating process, long though it may be, that&rsquo;s burrowed its way into Dan&rsquo;s heart and made it that much harder to allow a camera into the equation. It&rsquo;s the familiarity of Phil&rsquo;s favourite Christmas playlist and the sharp scent of Starbucks that&rsquo;s accompanied the process these last few years.</p><p>It&rsquo;s knowing that he always has someone to share all this with, regardless of where their lives have led them that year.</p><p>What can Dan say? He&rsquo;s a sucker for the familiar and the comforting, he supposes.</p><p>(Or maybe he&rsquo;s just a sucker for Phil. It&rsquo;s hard to tell.)</p><p>Truthfully, though, his favorite tradition isn&rsquo;t any of that. As much as he loves the tree decorating, their mince pie and festive drink codexes, even Christmas shopping and their dinners with Martyn and Cornelia and Bryony and their management team, none of them hold a candle to his and Phil&rsquo;s private Christmas celebration.</p><p>Dan will swear he&rsquo;s <i>not </i>materialistic&ndash;well, he appreciates nice things but doesn&rsquo;t everyone?&ndash;and that it&rsquo;s not about the presents. And truthfully, it isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Well, not entirely, anyway.</p><p>It&rsquo;s more about the thought that goes into those gifts and the little sparks of joy he gets from picking out Phil&rsquo;s presents. Giving themselves an entire day just for them before jetting (or chugging) off to their separate families sure doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p><p>Even if it does make those days apart that much harder.</p><p>But it&rsquo;ll be different next year.</p><p>Just the thrill of that promise is enough to settle a bit of the longing that pulls at Dan&rsquo;s heart whenever he&rsquo;s forcibly reminded of that sad brown bedroom once again. Things have been getting better every year, though, however slightly&ndash;so maybe this year won&rsquo;t be so bad?</p><p>It&rsquo;s just past 3am when Dan finally slips from beneath the sheets and pads over to his wardrobe, where Phil&rsquo;s gifts are hidden behind some of Dan&rsquo;s heaviest jumpers. Like a mouse, he snatches them up, wincing at the slight crinkling of their far too colourful wrapping paper.</p><p>Inches away, Phil lets out a tiny exhale.</p><p>Dan freezes for a second, his heart banging against his chest until he remembers that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s not like he and Phil can keep secrets from each other anyway.</p><p>But maybe it&rsquo;s the magic of the season bubbling up in him anyway. Sappy as it may be, Dan can&rsquo;t help the extra rush of love that comes with each reminder of his favourite day of the year.</p><p>Sneaking down the hallway and into the lounge, a slew of memories play before Dan&rsquo;s eyes. How many times has he done this very walk to nestle his carefully chosen gifts for this very person beneath their tree? In the little homes that they built together, and one that maybe wasn&rsquo;t theirs but sure was home to Dan when he needed one?</p><p>And&ndash;hold on a second. Is that <i>sugar </i>Dan&rsquo;s smelling? And chocolate?</p><p>Screw his annual custom of scouring under the tree to find his own presents. Phil&rsquo;s set out <i>cookies </i>for them, on a tiny round table that Dan almost tripped over! Just behind them is Dan&rsquo;s light box, displaying &ldquo;Merry Christmas Dan &lt;3&rdquo; in it.</p><p>Dan just stands there, clutching his chest for a few moments as he blinks back the tears that have suddenly sprouted.</p><p>This is new.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s the best kind of new.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dan&rsquo;s sliding into bed with a chocolate and cinnamon-coated tongue and a lightness in his heart. Phil sighs a little and pulls Dan close, Dan swiping the pillow Phil was previously holding and nestling it behind his head in one smooth motion.</p><p>He&rsquo;s unsure if Phil&rsquo;s actually awake or not but regardless, he whispers a &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; anyway. Phil&rsquo;s lips curl up in the softest of smiles and with that, Dan snuggles even closer, closing his eyes as memories of their Christmases together dance in his head.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>For a little while after he wakes up, Dan completely forgets what day it is. That&rsquo;s easy to do when last night&rsquo;s sweetness has completely washed off his tongue.</p><p>But a few minutes into his morning Twitter scroll, Phil grabs his arm with wide eyes and the absolute cutest grin and just like that, a bit of the magic flows back into Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; Phil says, his voice just above a whisper. &ldquo;Dandandan, don&rsquo;t tell me you forgot what today is!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan just answers with a kiss to Phil&rsquo;s cheek and an extra soft squeeze. &ldquo;&lsquo;Course not. Merry almost Christmas, Phil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Dan.&rdquo;</p><p>They stay there for a few moments, wrapped in each other&rsquo;s arms, drinking in the brilliant white sky streaming through the crack in the shades. Dan allows his lips to trace over some of his favourite parts of Phil, soft and lingering, until Phil starts squirming just a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;You ready for present time, babe?&rdquo; Dan giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmm, I was <i>born </i>ready,&rdquo; Phil counters. &ldquo;Just wait till you see what I got you. You&rsquo;re gonna die, sir Daniel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a threat now, is it?&rdquo; Dan says, running his eyes all over Phil, a smirk dancing at the edges of his lips. &ldquo;Well. We&rsquo;ll see about that, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>And he slinks out of the room, heading down to the kitchen&ndash;but not before giving Phil&rsquo;s ass a deft pinch, of course.</p><p>It is their Christmas, after all.</p><p>Their coffee routine becomes a languid affair that morning. Despite this, there&rsquo;s still an inexplicable unease fluttering in the dark recesses of Dan&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>So he takes some slightly deeper breaths, forces himself to focus on things he can see and hear, like the soft hum of the microwave as it heats up the water for Phil&rsquo;s instant coffee and the way the sun makes little diamonds on the shelves when Dan opens the cupboards.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s a pair of arms wrapping around his bare chest and hair tickling at his neck and <i>ohhhh </i>is that nice.</p><p>Dan instantly melts into the touch. He twists around slowly, his face a giant question mark. But Phil just smiles and presses a kiss beneath Dan&rsquo;s ear before detaching and settling himself at the table.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; Phil says, once they&rsquo;re both seated with steaming festive mugs and identical bowls of cereal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite glad we&rsquo;re doing this today, instead of at my mum and dad&rsquo;s like last year. I kinda missed having our own gift exchange.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan takes his time chewing his next spoonful, really allowing the Crunchy Nut and almond milk to wash over his tongue before finally swallowing. &ldquo;Yeah. I mean, as amazing as that was, I&rsquo;m still not used to people giving a fuss over what we got each other. Well, besides&hellip;. you know. But I really like it being our thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Phil mumbles around his next mouthful.</p><p>Dan just smiles down into his bowl.</p><p>It really is nice having some things just for them.</p><p>A few minutes of companionable silence pass, then Phil&rsquo;s cold toes are suddenly tapping against Dan&rsquo;s leg. &ldquo;Hey. Hey. Hey. You saw the tree last night, right? Or, well, you saw what was by it anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my <i>god </i>Phil, put some slippers on or something. Your toes are like giant ice cubes!&rdquo; Dan protests.</p><p>Phil just makes a face. Of course it&rsquo;s nothing but soft. &ldquo;Fiiiiiine. But did you see it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I saw it, you spoon,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear me say thank you last night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Phil shakes his head a little. &ldquo;I may remember something about that. Hard to say, though.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan has half a mind to lean over and kiss the gleeful smirk off Phil&rsquo;s lips. He very nearly leans in too, but chooses to grab his mug and roll his eyes instead. &ldquo;Well, in any case. Thank you again. It really was a lovely 3am surprise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what, I&rsquo;m not even gonna bother commenting on that bedtime. Merry Christmas,&rdquo; Phil giggles.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dan says, suddenly noticing the now-empty bowls and mugs before them. &ldquo;Oh hey,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;I believe I was promised death by presents today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well. Don&rsquo;t sound so excited there, mate.&rdquo; But Phil&rsquo;s smiling as he pushes himself out of his seat anyway.</p><p>Five minutes later, they&rsquo;re both wearing their comfiest pajamas and sitting on the hardwood floor in front of the tree. Up in the lounge, it may not appear quite as magical as it did last night, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t mind. It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s any less special, not with Phil here.</p><p>&ldquo;You left some of the cookies? Awww, Dan. Thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course the minute Dan turns to face him, Phil&rsquo;s already stuffing a chocolate chip cookie in his mouth with a massive grin, a deformed gingerbread man dangling from his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;I figured they were for today anyway,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;But can I <i>pleaseeee </i>give you your gifts first? I got some really good ones this year. Please, Phil?&rdquo; He pulls out his best doe eyes, doing everything in his power to fight the smile that&rsquo;s just dying to take over his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>fine</i>. But you better not be sneking me. I know your sneking face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No sneks here, I promise.&rdquo; Dan bats his eyes while pulling his smallest box from under the tree. &ldquo;This one first!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil just shoots him the fondest of side eyes while Dan folds his hands in his lap to hopefully keep his fingers from tapping excessively.</p><p>Within seconds, Phil&rsquo;s already ripped into the parcel to find&hellip;.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan!!! You said you weren&rsquo;t gonna snek me!!&rdquo;</p><p>He leans over to smack Dan in the arm with the small white box of hair regrowth treatment, his teasing smirk only growing bigger as they both dissolve in laughter loud enough to fill the entire building. (Alright, maybe that&rsquo;s just Dan. But judging by the deep crinkles near Phil&rsquo;s eyes, he loves it anyway.)</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a snek! It&rsquo;s an <i>investment</i>,&rdquo; Dan protests, snatching the wrapping paper off the ground in a futile attempt to defend himself.</p><p>Phil just stares at it in amusement for a few seconds before shaking his head and dropping the box to the side.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a dork,&rdquo; Phil sighs. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this is our tenth Christmas together.&rdquo;</p><p>And just like that, those words are enough to melt some of Dan&rsquo;s playfulness into pure fondness. &ldquo;God. It is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a few seconds of comfortable silence as they each gaze down at the floor, then back at each other with softened eyes and deep smiles. Something sharp tugs at Dan&rsquo;s heart but he lets it be.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve both come a long way from their terrified 18 and 22 year old selves. Yet Dan wouldn&rsquo;t trade that first Christmas together for the world.</p><p>He can&rsquo;t let himself get too soft, though, so he pulls a long rectangular parcel from the stash. &ldquo;Okay, I <i>promise </i>this one isn&rsquo;t a snek. It actually may be my favourite of the three.&rdquo;</p><p>It really is. This is the one he spent the most time on, the one he spent so many hours tweaking until it perfectly captured their last year together. It has the most <i>Dan </i>in it than either of the others.</p><p>Phil just side eyes him again, then snatches up the gift and rips it open anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Dan</i>. Oh my god, you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s voice is a near whisper, soft as candlelight and just as sweet. His eyes are positively reverential as he runs a finger over the raised letters on the cover of the photo album.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I did. You know I can&rsquo;t allow our tour memories to only live inside our phones. Just, uhhhh&hellip;.&rdquo; Dan pauses as Phil slowly opens the front cover, &ldquo;ignore that smudge right there, I kinda forgot I was cursed for all eternity.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, Phil&rsquo;s eyes go straight to the barely legible message but he just giggles sweetly. &ldquo;I love it anyway. This is getting a special place of honour in the forever home. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan beams.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Phil says after a few moments, &ldquo;you got any more or can I give you yours now? Pleaaaseeee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm, not so fast there, Lester,&rdquo; Dan says, pulling out a tall, brightly wrapped box. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, there is one more. It&rsquo;s kinda our new tradition, if you get my drift.&rdquo;</p><p>Instantly, Phil&rsquo;s face lights up, his smile growing even deeper when he finally rips apart the paper and opens the smooth white box.</p><p>Inside is a candle, but it&rsquo;s not just any candle. Much like the deer Dan got him a couple years ago, this one is green and shaped like a dragon&ndash;well, if dragons could sit on their butts like dogs anyway. Phil runs his fingers over and over the scales, his lips slightly parted. The adorableness is enough to make Dan&rsquo;s heart burst.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I&hellip;. how do you always find the <i>coolest </i>things? I almost don&rsquo;t wanna burn this now, it&rsquo;s too pretty!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, though? I thought it would look amazing in the lounge of the new place, maybe even next to the tour album,&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;But hey, more importantly, are you gonna name it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmmm, I think I&rsquo;ll wait for a name to come to me,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m way way way too excited to see you open yours.

Unlike Phil, he takes his time carefully peeling at each piece of tape and reveling in Phil&rsquo;s squirming.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I did an amazing job wrapping that! But come <i>onnnnnn</i>, I&rsquo;m gonna go old and grey just watching you open it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you the hair regrowing stuff was a good investment!&rdquo; Dan laughs. &ldquo;Now, for your information&ndash;&rdquo; His next words are cut off as he finally pulls the short black box out of the paper and lifts up the top.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, <i>Phil</i>.
