Amber gave them a small smile and a shy wave, which caused TJ to turn around to see who the hell rose that reaction out of the blonde.</p><p>He turned to see a pixie haired girl sporting a pink headband along with a few pins on the mandatory uniform making her way to the textbook section. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d TJ asked, turning back to face Amber.</p><p>Amber coughed. \u201cThat\u2019s Andi, from my biology class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi, huh?\u201d TJ smirked.</p><p>Amber crossed her arms, now on the defensive. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m not the one in denial,\u201d TJ teased.</p><p>Amber just swatted his shoulder.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>The fated day had finally arrived.</p><p>TJ was actually close enough to read whatever Cyrus was scribbling in the latest book he\u2019d picked up.</p><p>TJ leaned forward just a bit in order to catch the name of the book, and immediately grew ecstatic when he saw the familiar cover of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, his personal favorite play. He had to see what was being written in those margins.</p><p>So, instead of being a normal person and try to forget about it because it\u2019s totally not his place, he did the most TJ thing possible and started formulating his plan.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>TJ knocked on Cyrus\u2019 door, knowing this definitely wasn\u2019t his brightest idea, but he was going through with it anyway because, well, maybe he actually didn\u2019t know yet. Whatever.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t even finish opening the door when TJ held up his own copy of the play and said, \u201cI can\u2019t stand a naked lightbulb, any more than I can a rude remark or vulgar action.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cWhat? I mean, I know that\u2019s a quote, but\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite plays,\u201d TJ explains, \u201cand I bet it\u2019s one of yours too.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in true Cyrus fashion. \u201cWhy are you so insistent on talking to me about literature?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, a small smile having not left his face throughout the entire conversation. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sure you like it, whether you want to admit it or not.\u201d He leaned in, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell your chess buddies.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus simply squinted and opened his door a bit more. \u201cAre you gonna come in or not?\u201d</p><p>TJ walked into the dorm room, marveling at all of the various literature themed posters adorning the walls. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you called me a nerd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a nerd!\u201d Cyrus retorted. \u201cI just&hellip; have passions.\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m just teasing. It\u2019s nice to finally meet someone who likes literature as much as me.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked over at Cyrus then with a soft gaze, and he couldn\u2019t help but think that for a split second, Cyrus did the same.</p><p>They stood there for a moment, until Cyrus turned away to grab his copy of <i>Streetcar</i>, handing it to the taller boy. \u201cSince you\u2019re so interested in what I\u2019ve been thinking about these books, you can read it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d TJ asked, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be invading anything.\u201d He thought back to the week and a half of him trying to peer over to look at Cyrus\u2019 desk. Yeah, that line was crossed a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Just as long as you tell me what you think too,\u201d Cyrus said, the smallest ghost of a teasing smile on his face.</p><p>TJ scratched the back of his neck. \u201cMaybe we could, like, discuss it or something?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus took a glance at his desk and winced. \u201cI&hellip; can\u2019t right now, my physics teacher is a bitch and he assigned us 30 pages of textbook notes for tomorrow. Maybe another time?\u201d</p><p>TJ, the ever hopeful, replied, \u201cI get it. What about Saturday?\u201d</p><p>It was apparent Cyrus hadn\u2019t expected TJ to come up with an actual day, considering the confused face he made, but still he softened and replied, \u201cYeah. Saturday.\u201d</p>",

Hell, he thinks about the instances every other day, but it\u2019s not like he tells him that. Jonah would think he was ridiculous, just like he would think Jonah\u2019s ridiculous for feeling this crazy about him. </p><p>Okay, neither would think the other were crazy. They\u2019d be pretty stoked. </p><p>Again, though, no way in hell would they admit that.</p><p>When Jonah takes Cyrus up to his room, it\u2019s nice to know that Pedro won\u2019t be back from tutoring for at least a few hours, which Cyrus currently doesn\u2019t know about.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Pedro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Study group.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you know when he\u2019ll be back?\u201d Cyrus asks.</p><p>\u201cNot till late. He\u2019s annoying, I know.\u201d Jonah briskly laughs.</p><p>\u201cNah, he\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Cyrus smiles, making Jonah turn bright red and fear that Cyrus thinks that because he might see what Pedro says about the two of them to be far from true. </p><p>\u201cYeah, you think?\u201d Jonah scoffs, grinning at the sound of Cyrus\u2019 giggle. </p><p>What he\u2019s not laughing at, though, is the sound of Pedro\u2019s obnoxious footsteps sprinting up the staircase, and running over to Jonah\u2019s door which he flings open.</p><p>\u201cGet out!!\u201d Jonah screams instantaneously.</p><p>\u201cWOW JONAH, YOU\u2019RE RIGHT, HE IS CUTE.\u201d Pedro screams loudly. </p><p>\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Jonah shouts over Pedro\u2019s cackling, stomping over and shoving him back into the hall, slamming the door in his face and making sure to lock it. </p><p>The fact that Cyrus is practically snickering isn\u2019t making Jonah\u2019s turmoil any easier. </p><p>Once he can tell that Pedro is gone, he feels it\u2019s safe to speak. \u201cUm&hellip;He doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re cute.\u201d That, he can be honest about.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Cyrus laughs, smiling at the redness shining on Jonah\u2019s cheeks. \u201cDo you, though&hellip;?\u201d </p><p>He has a feeling that Jonah thinks he\u2019s more than \u2018cute\u2019 if Pedro was so reliant on teasing him about their friendship. </p><p>\u201cSo what if I did?\u201d Jonah defends. \u201cAm I not allowed to acknowledge the attractiveness of other guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think I\u2019m attractive.\u201d Cyrus states.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you are&hellip;\u201d Jonah tries to carelessly play it off with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWell, so are you.\u201d </p><p>Jonah can\u2019t stop himself from blushing harder, or tightening up. \u201cThanks.\u201d He flashes a smile, wiping away the sweat from his face, only growing more embarrassed when Cyrus chuckles. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all you are, though.\u201d Cyrus continues.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jonah\u2019s heart stutters at the thought of him elaborating. </p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, c\u2019mon, you\u2019re funny, and clever, and, maybe a little oblivious-\u201c</p><p>They both laugh. </p><p>\u201cBut, yeah.\u201d Cyrus beams. \u201cI like you&hellip;\u201d He sees no shame in admitting it, considering he\u2019s pretty sure that Jonah likes him too. Pedro couldn\u2019t have made all those comments for no absolute reason. Plus, with how intrigued and blissful Jonah acts around him, it all adds up. </p><p>Instead of words, Jonah responds with a kiss to his lips, one that goes on for as long as they can manage, repeating the process several more times and getting more lost in the moment the longer it lasts. </p><p>In the middle of grinning and pecking each other repeatedly, just as Jonah wraps his arms around him, Cyrus\u2019 phone rings, causing them to break apart and look to each other in despair, before Cyrus answers his mother, who requests he come home. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Cyrus is apologizing to Jonah after he\u2019s hung up. \u201cI totally forgot that she needs me to join her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how I forgot Pedro would be coming home sooner than expected?\u201d Jonah smiles, making Cyrus scoff.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like that. Maybe it\u2019s best that he did.\u201d He gets Jonah to think about it, and come to conclusion that Cyrus is absolutely right.</p><p>\u201cI walk you out?\u201d He offers. </p><p>Cyrus proudly takes his hand. </p><p>Down in the kitchen, Pedro can\u2019t help but notice that not only are Jonah and Cyrus\u2019 shoulders touching, but they\u2019re walking hand in hand and beaming at each other on the way to the front door. </p><p>Saying their final goodbyes, they share a gratifying hug, Cyrus and Pedro exchanging smile smiles while temporarily facing each other\u2019s directions. </p><p>After Jonah watches Cyrus walk out the door, he shuts it closed, instantly sprinting over to Pedro and giving him the biggest squeeze of all.</p><p>\u201c<i>Thank you.\u201d </i></p><p>Behind his teasing, was always the best of intentions. </p>",
