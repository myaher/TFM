Wakanda had lost\nits king, he\u2019s just lost his best friend all over again, as well as more\nfriends, and he had just found out who else had died who weren\u2019t in Wakanda. </p><!-- more --><p>When he saw Tony for the first time, he knew immediately who\nwas missing, and it made his heart stop. \u201cIs Peter\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah he\u2019s gone. He went in my arms.\u201d Tony said\nquickly, not wanting to talk too slowly in case he let his emotions spill out\nagain. \u201cWhat about Y/N\u2026?\u201d Tony asked in response. Steve gulped, feeling almost\nguilty. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay&hellip;\u201d He responded. Tony nodded, walking past his\nold friend, putting a hand on his shoulder, patting it before continuing on his\nway. While Steve was happy that his son was okay, he was worried about how he\nwas going to tell you. How he was going to tell you that not only had your\nuncle that you\u2019d started to grow close to, had died, countless friends but also\nyour best friend, Peter. </p><p>He had flown to you. He kept his distance from you for your\nown safety when he became a fugitive and Tony had promised to help keep your\nnew identity a secret. You had understood, and didn\u2019t complain much since May\nhad offered the spare room in the apartment to you, knowing that you were\nPeter\u2019s best friend and Steve\u2019s son. For the past few years you\u2019d been under\nthe fake identity of Peter\u2019s cousin from another of May\u2019s siblings that in\nreality, didn\u2019t exist. This also meant you were especially close with Peter.\nThis made it even harder. </p><p>Steve showed up at the door of May\u2019s apartment, and as soon\nas she opened the door, the despair in her eyes was already there. He knew that\nshe knew. But that now raised the question- did you know already? </p><p>\u201cT-The news found out that Spiderman had died\u2026 overheard or\nsomething\u2026 Y/N ran out as soon as it was announced.\u201d She explained. Steve\nfrowned, looking down silently. May sniffed, but held her head high. \u201cI just\ntried to call him, and he isn\u2019t picking up his phone, I think you should go\nlooking for him. Don\u2019t worry about me\u2026 I\u2019m tough, and I\u2019ll know this\u2019ll work\nout\u2026 somehow. Just go find your son.\u201d She ordered at the captain. Steve nodded,\ngiving a quick hug, before turning and leaving to find you. </p><p>He walked the streets of New York. No one stopped for\nautographs, or to take pictures, and no one turned to yell abuse or to call the\ncops since he was still technically a fugitive. They could see the injuries on\nhis face and battered, altered uniform, and they all knew he\u2019d done his best.\nThey could also see in his eyes he wasn\u2019t finished, and he was looking for\nsomething. Someone. So they weren\u2019t going to slow the search. He walked block\nafter block, not finding you, and part of him started to panic. </p><p>What if you were a late reaction? </p><p>Soon police stopped him, not arresting him, but telling him\nto go home. He responded by saying he\u2019d be patrolling tomorrow, looking for his\nnow missing son. They didn\u2019t stop him. </p><p>The sight of Captain America walking around New York,\npatrolling was becoming a normal sight. It had been two weeks since Thanos\nsnapped his fingers, and people were trying to pick up the pieces. Not to move\non, but to get things up and running before things got even worse. It did make\ncommunities and families closer. Big, usually selfish companies were giving out\nlarge amounts purely to help people who had lost a lot- especially kids and\nparents who had lost each other. People had set up groups to look for people\nwho were missing, due to people not know if they were a victim or not. Despite\nthe close community, Steve still couldn\u2019t find his son. By this point, your\nidentity had been released, and Steve no longer walked alone. People walked\nwith him, working as second eyes to look for you, but also others. </p><p>Steve was losing hope, and it was destroying him. He had\nlost everything, and the thought of losing his own son as well felt like too\nmuch. At least with Bucky, Wanda and Sam, he knew what happened. He saw what\nhappened. He knows where they are. But he wasn\u2019t there for you, and now he had\nno idea. </p><p>\u201cMr Rogers?\u201d An officer interrupted the cycle this day.\nSteve turned to her, coming to a halt, but stepping closer to her, allowing the\ncrowd of people also searching to continue walking. </p><p>\u201cNew files? Any found?\u201d He asked, expecting to be handed new\npictures of new faces hoping to be found. He was handed a picture, but the\npicture was familiar. It was your picture. \u201cOfficer, this is my son.\u201d Steve\ntold the officer, his voice shaking. </p><p>\u201cI know. I found him.\u201d The officer answered. Steve\u2019s head\nshot up, seeing the hopeful smile on the officer\u2019s face. Some of the crowd had\nheard, and had turn to see. She didn\u2019t have to tell him to follow, both of them\nrunning through the streets of abandoned cars. People didn\u2019t drive around New York.\nCars were forced to the side and only buses and military trucks were used due\nto the amount of cars not being needed. </p><p>They came to one of the shelters set up in a bar to help the\nhomeless and lost, and you stood out. You were sat at the bar, fiddling with\nyour hands, wearing what Steve knew to be Peter\u2019s jacket. \u201cY/N!\u201d Steve called\nimmediately, making you look up. Seeing your dad, you jumped from your seat,\nrunning and just hugging him tightly. \u201cThank god\u2026 I thought you were dead.\u201d\nSteve sobbed. How could he not? He didn\u2019t care that people saw the Captain cry,\nbecause right now he wasn\u2019t the Captain. He was your father. </p><p>\u201cI-is it true dad? Is Peter dead?\u201d You asked, lifting your\nhead at him. He frowned, kneeling down and nodding. He hated seeing his son\ncry. Seeing his child cry always broke his heart. </p><p>\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd Bucky\u2026 and Wanda, Sam\u2026\nbut listen to me, okay?\u201d Steve demanded. You looked back at him, continuing to\ncry, but listening. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end. Even if we can\u2019t bring them back, we\ncan make sure that bastard pays for what he\u2019s done. We will find Thanos, and\nmake him pay for what he\u2019s done. I promise. We\u2019ll get revenge for Peter, and\neveryone else Thanos killed.\u201d He promised. When he first told his team this, he\nwas far from convincing in his promise. But this time was different. Thanos\nhadn\u2019t just hurt him. He\u2019d hurt his son, and while the world can drag him\nthrough the mud all it wants, he sure as hell isn\u2019t gonna let that happen to\nyou. He felt the determination in his veins as he told you this, and even more\nwhen he hugged you. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

Wakanda had lost\nits king, he\u2019s just lost his best friend all over again, as well as more\nfriends, and he had just found out who else had died who weren\u2019t in Wakanda. </p>[[MORE]]<p>When he saw Tony for the first time, he knew immediately who\nwas missing, and it made his heart stop. \u201cIs Peter\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah he\u2019s gone. He went in my arms.\u201d Tony said\nquickly, not wanting to talk too slowly in case he let his emotions spill out\nagain. \u201cWhat about Y/N\u2026?\u201d Tony asked in response. Steve gulped, feeling almost\nguilty. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d He responded. Tony nodded, walking past his\nold friend, putting a hand on his shoulder, patting it before continuing on his\nway. While Steve was happy that his son was okay, he was worried about how he\nwas going to tell you. How he was going to tell you that not only had your\nuncle that you\u2019d started to grow close to, had died, countless friends but also\nyour best friend, Peter. </p><p>He had flown to you. He kept his distance from you for your\nown safety when he became a fugitive and Tony had promised to help keep your\nnew identity a secret. You had understood, and didn\u2019t complain much since May\nhad offered the spare room in the apartment to you, knowing that you were\nPeter\u2019s best friend and Steve\u2019s son. For the past few years you\u2019d been under\nthe fake identity of Peter\u2019s cousin from another of May\u2019s siblings that in\nreality, didn\u2019t exist. This also meant you were especially close with Peter.\nThis made it even harder. </p><p>Steve showed up at the door of May\u2019s apartment, and as soon\nas she opened the door, the despair in her eyes was already there. He knew that\nshe knew. But that now raised the question- did you know already? </p><p>\u201cT-The news found out that Spiderman had died\u2026 overheard or\nsomething\u2026 Y/N ran out as soon as it was announced.\u201d She explained. Steve\nfrowned, looking down silently. May sniffed, but held her head high. \u201cI just\ntried to call him, and he isn\u2019t picking up his phone, I think you should go\nlooking for him. Don\u2019t worry about me\u2026 I\u2019m tough, and I\u2019ll know this\u2019ll work\nout\u2026 somehow. Just go find your son.\u201d She ordered at the captain. Steve nodded,\ngiving a quick hug, before turning and leaving to find you. </p><p>He walked the streets of New York. No one stopped for\nautographs, or to take pictures, and no one turned to yell abuse or to call the\ncops since he was still technically a fugitive. They could see the injuries on\nhis face and battered, altered uniform, and they all knew he\u2019d done his best.\nThey could also see in his eyes he wasn\u2019t finished, and he was looking for\nsomething. Someone. So they weren\u2019t going to slow the search. He walked block\nafter block, not finding you, and part of him started to panic. </p><p>What if you were a late reaction? </p><p>Soon police stopped him, not arresting him, but telling him\nto go home. He responded by saying he\u2019d be patrolling tomorrow, looking for his\nnow missing son. They didn\u2019t stop him. </p><p>The sight of Captain America walking around New York,\npatrolling was becoming a normal sight. It had been two weeks since Thanos\nsnapped his fingers, and people were trying to pick up the pieces. Not to move\non, but to get things up and running before things got even worse. It did make\ncommunities and families closer. Big, usually selfish companies were giving out\nlarge amounts purely to help people who had lost a lot- especially kids and\nparents who had lost each other. People had set up groups to look for people\nwho were missing, due to people not know if they were a victim or not. Despite\nthe close community, Steve still couldn\u2019t find his son. By this point, your\nidentity had been released, and Steve no longer walked alone. People walked\nwith him, working as second eyes to look for you, but also others. </p><p>Steve was losing hope, and it was destroying him. He had\nlost everything, and the thought of losing his own son as well felt like too\nmuch. At least with Bucky, Wanda and Sam, he knew what happened. He saw what\nhappened. He knows where they are. But he wasn\u2019t there for you, and now he had\nno idea. </p><p>\u201cMr Rogers?\u201d An officer interrupted the cycle this day.\nSteve turned to her, coming to a halt, but stepping closer to her, allowing the\ncrowd of people also searching to continue walking. </p><p>\u201cNew files? Any found?\u201d He asked, expecting to be handed new\npictures of new faces hoping to be found. He was handed a picture, but the\npicture was familiar. It was your picture. \u201cOfficer, this is my son.\u201d Steve\ntold the officer, his voice shaking. </p><p>\u201cI know. I found him.\u201d The officer answered. Steve\u2019s head\nshot up, seeing the hopeful smile on the officer\u2019s face. Some of the crowd had\nheard, and had turn to see. She didn\u2019t have to tell him to follow, both of them\nrunning through the streets of abandoned cars. People didn\u2019t drive around New York.\nCars were forced to the side and only buses and military trucks were used due\nto the amount of cars not being needed. </p><p>They came to one of the shelters set up in a bar to help the\nhomeless and lost, and you stood out. You were sat at the bar, fiddling with\nyour hands, wearing what Steve knew to be Peter\u2019s jacket. \u201cY/N!\u201d Steve called\nimmediately, making you look up. Seeing your dad, you jumped from your seat,\nrunning and just hugging him tightly. \u201cThank god\u2026 I thought you were dead.\u201d\nSteve sobbed. How could he not? He didn\u2019t care that people saw the Captain cry,\nbecause right now he wasn\u2019t the Captain. He was your father. </p><p>\u201cI-is it true dad? Is Peter dead?\u201d You asked, lifting your\nhead at him. He frowned, kneeling down and nodding. He hated seeing his son\ncry. Seeing his child cry always broke his heart. </p><p>\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd Bucky\u2026 and Wanda, Sam\u2026\nbut listen to me, okay?\u201d Steve demanded. You looked back at him, continuing to\ncry, but listening. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end. Even if we can\u2019t bring them back, we\ncan make sure that bastard pays for what he\u2019s done. We will find Thanos, and\nmake him pay for what he\u2019s done. I promise. We\u2019ll get revenge for Peter, and\neveryone else Thanos killed.\u201d He promised. When he first told his team this, he\nwas far from convincing in his promise. But this time was different. Thanos\nhadn\u2019t just hurt him. He\u2019d hurt his son, and while the world can drag him\nthrough the mud all it wants, he sure as hell isn\u2019t gonna let that happen to\nyou. He felt the determination in his veins as he told you this, and even more\nwhen he hugged you. \n\n\n\n</p><hr><p>Hope you like it!

An angst/fluff hybrid I guess\nlmao</b></p><hr /><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Steve had a lot of things to think about. Wakanda had lost\nits king, he&rsquo;s just lost his best friend all over again, as well as more\nfriends, and he had just found out who else had died who weren&rsquo;t in Wakanda. </p><p>When he saw Tony for the first time, he knew immediately who\nwas missing, and it made his heart stop. &ldquo;Is Peter&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah he&rsquo;s gone. He went in my arms.&rdquo; Tony said\nquickly, not wanting to talk too slowly in case he let his emotions spill out\nagain. &ldquo;What about Y/N&hellip;?&rdquo; Tony asked in response. Steve gulped, feeling almost\nguilty. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s okay&hellip;&rdquo; He responded. Tony nodded, walking past his\nold friend, putting a hand on his shoulder, patting it before continuing on his\nway. While Steve was happy that his son was okay, he was worried about how he\nwas going to tell you. How he was going to tell you that not only had your\nuncle that you&rsquo;d started to grow close to, had died, countless friends but also\nyour best friend, Peter. </p><p>He had flown to you. He kept his distance from you for your\nown safety when he became a fugitive and Tony had promised to help keep your\nnew identity a secret. You had understood, and didn&rsquo;t complain much since May\nhad offered the spare room in the apartment to you, knowing that you were\nPeter&rsquo;s best friend and Steve&rsquo;s son. For the past few years you&rsquo;d been under\nthe fake identity of Peter&rsquo;s cousin from another of May&rsquo;s siblings that in\nreality, didn&rsquo;t exist. This also meant you were especially close with Peter.\nThis made it even harder. </p><p>Steve showed up at the door of May&rsquo;s apartment, and as soon\nas she opened the door, the despair in her eyes was already there. He knew that\nshe knew. But that now raised the question- did you know already? </p><p>&ldquo;T-The news found out that Spiderman had died&hellip; overheard or\nsomething&hellip; Y/N ran out as soon as it was announced.&rdquo; She explained. Steve\nfrowned, looking down silently. May sniffed, but held her head high. &ldquo;I just\ntried to call him, and he isn&rsquo;t picking up his phone, I think you should go\nlooking for him. Don&rsquo;t worry about me&hellip; I&rsquo;m tough, and I&rsquo;ll know this&rsquo;ll work\nout&hellip; somehow. Just go find your son.&rdquo; She ordered at the captain. Steve nodded,\ngiving a quick hug, before turning and leaving to find you. </p><p>He walked the streets of New York. No one stopped for\nautographs, or to take pictures, and no one turned to yell abuse or to call the\ncops since he was still technically a fugitive. They could see the injuries on\nhis face and battered, altered uniform, and they all knew he&rsquo;d done his best.\nThey could also see in his eyes he wasn&rsquo;t finished, and he was looking for\nsomething. Someone. So they weren&rsquo;t going to slow the search. He walked block\nafter block, not finding you, and part of him started to panic. </p><p>What if you were a late reaction? </p><p>Soon police stopped him, not arresting him, but telling him\nto go home. He responded by saying he&rsquo;d be patrolling tomorrow, looking for his\nnow missing son. They didn&rsquo;t stop him. </p><p>The sight of Captain America walking around New York,\npatrolling was becoming a normal sight. It had been two weeks since Thanos\nsnapped his fingers, and people were trying to pick up the pieces. Not to move\non, but to get things up and running before things got even worse. It did make\ncommunities and families closer. Big, usually selfish companies were giving out\nlarge amounts purely to help people who had lost a lot- especially kids and\nparents who had lost each other. People had set up groups to look for people\nwho were missing, due to people not know if they were a victim or not. Despite\nthe close community, Steve still couldn&rsquo;t find his son. By this point, your\nidentity had been released, and Steve no longer walked alone. People walked\nwith him, working as second eyes to look for you, but also others. </p><p>Steve was losing hope, and it was destroying him. He had\nlost everything, and the thought of losing his own son as well felt like too\nmuch. At least with Bucky, Wanda and Sam, he knew what happened. He saw what\nhappened. He knows where they are. But he wasn&rsquo;t there for you, and now he had\nno idea. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr Rogers?&rdquo; An officer interrupted the cycle this day.\nSteve turned to her, coming to a halt, but stepping closer to her, allowing the\ncrowd of people also searching to continue walking. </p><p>&ldquo;New files? Any found?&rdquo; He asked, expecting to be handed new\npictures of new faces hoping to be found. He was handed a picture, but the\npicture was familiar. It was your picture. &ldquo;Officer, this is my son.&rdquo; Steve\ntold the officer, his voice shaking. </p><p>&ldquo;I know. I found him.&rdquo; The officer answered. Steve&rsquo;s head\nshot up, seeing the hopeful smile on the officer&rsquo;s face. Some of the crowd had\nheard, and had turn to see. She didn&rsquo;t have to tell him to follow, both of them\nrunning through the streets of abandoned cars. People didn&rsquo;t drive around New York.\nCars were forced to the side and only buses and military trucks were used due\nto the amount of cars not being needed. </p><p>They came to one of the shelters set up in a bar to help the\nhomeless and lost, and you stood out. You were sat at the bar, fiddling with\nyour hands, wearing what Steve knew to be Peter&rsquo;s jacket. &ldquo;Y/N!&rdquo; Steve called\nimmediately, making you look up. Seeing your dad, you jumped from your seat,\nrunning and just hugging him tightly. &ldquo;Thank god&hellip; I thought you were dead.&rdquo;\nSteve sobbed. How could he not? He didn&rsquo;t care that people saw the Captain cry,\nbecause right now he wasn&rsquo;t the Captain. He was your father. </p><p>&ldquo;I-is it true dad? Is Peter dead?&rdquo; You asked, lifting your\nhead at him. He frowned, kneeling down and nodding. He hated seeing his son\ncry. Seeing his child cry always broke his heart. </p><p>\n\n\n\n&ldquo;And Bucky&hellip; and Wanda, Sam&hellip;\nbut listen to me, okay?&rdquo; Steve demanded. You looked back at him, continuing to\ncry, but listening. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the end. Even if we can&rsquo;t bring them back, we\ncan make sure that bastard pays for what he&rsquo;s done. We will find Thanos, and\nmake him pay for what he&rsquo;s done. I promise. We&rsquo;ll get revenge for Peter, and\neveryone else Thanos killed.&rdquo; He promised. When he first told his team this, he\nwas far from convincing in his promise. But this time was different. Thanos\nhadn&rsquo;t just hurt him. He&rsquo;d hurt his son, and while the world can drag him\nthrough the mud all it wants, he sure as hell isn&rsquo;t gonna let that happen to\nyou. He felt the determination in his veins as he told you this, and even more\nwhen he hugged you. \n\n\n\n</p><hr /><p>Hope you like it!
