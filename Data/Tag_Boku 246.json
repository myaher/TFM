He will not naturally open up to you and will dismiss at the thought of having anyone getting to know geniunely. He will be on his guard in case you had ulterior motives. The first few weeks of getting to know him consist of little to no small talk and long periods of silence. <br/></li><li>The only times you really get to know is just the walks after school or before school. Maybe it was the fatigue from the school day, but he\u2019s more open to teasing remarks and dry humor.<br/></li><li>The more time you get to know him, despite his noncompliance, his small mannerisms become noticeable. How his fingers picked at the dry skin of his lips, how his voice laughed with an adorably awkward lilt, how his eyebrows crease when you act like an oddball. When you voice these things to him, he blinks in wonder.<br/></li><li>Nobody has ever took notice to him before, excluding Aizawa. How was it possible you didn\u2019t see him outside his quirk? It was weirdly uplifting.<br/></li><li>He wants to learn more on what you notice about him.<br/></li><li>This starts the shared extensive training sessions and long library hours to better each other\u2019s quirk. He begins to gradually acknowledge your determination and hard working ethic. Shinsou also begins to notice how you bit your lip in deep thought, tap your foot anxiously, and other small touches that no one else would notice.<br/></li><li>That\u2019s how you become friends or \u201cfriendly acquaintances\u201d, as he puts it.<br/></li><li>You don\u2019t change him but support him to the best of his abilities.<br/></li><li>Over time, you kinda view him as a tall pillar. He\u2019s not fazed by others\u2019 remarks about him and is so driven to get to the hero course. It gives you a reason to do better and you\u2019re glad to him around.<br/></li><li>You cry tears of pure joy and relief at the end of the Sports Festival. Everyone begins to regains his worth that you\u2019ve noticed a long time ago. It fills you up with elation and when express it to him, Shinsou can\u2019t help but give a warm smile.<br/></li><li>You\u2019re the first one he tells when he\u2019s being taken under Aizawa\u2019s wing. You\u2019re practically over the moon and just hug him in the moment, telling him how proud you are on how far he\u2019s come.<br/></li><li>You pull away once you realize what you did, blushing like a mad men.<br/></li><li>He pulls you back and returns the hug.<br/></li><li>\u201cThank you&hellip;\u201d His voice soft and raw.<br/></li><li>From that day on, he dedicates himself to working hard for you too. <br/></li><li>Everyone in U.A. already knew you guys were a thing. It was so obvious that you blushed when your classmate finally told you. And you didn\u2019t deny it.<br/></li><li>Shinsou took a while to acknowledge your feelings for you. It was a weird feeling for him and it got annoying how you easily invaded his mind. He\u2019s never knew someone that could become so important to him in a matter of months.<br/></li><li>Your first kiss came unexpectantly. You can imagine that on your own time.<br/></li><li>Constant support and validation everyday. Shinsou doesn\u2019t show it, but he appreciates it deeply.<br/></li><li>He likes to kiss on the temple or the cheek.<br/></li><li>He likes to be kissed on the forehead or his eyebrows.<br/></li><li>Not a fan of PDA, but will lean on your shoulder or rest his head on your lap any day .<br/></li><li>Just likes to rest his forehead against yours and close his eyes for reassurance.<br/></li><li>You guys have a long list of inside jokes.<br/></li><li>Late night calls where you guys lay on your bed and talk about nonsense. One of you falls always falls asleep and complains about your phone being dead the next day.<br/></li><li>I feel like he would be the most experienced with dealing with anxiety and stress than anybody. He\u2019s definitely dealt with it before with his quirk and how strangers react to it. Seeing you in such a panicked state indistinctly makes him grab your hand and intently listen to you. He prioritizes your safety and just make you feel emotionally secure, day in and out.<br/></li><li>Being honest and open and weird is a must.<br/></li><li>If you don\u2019t cackle like a witch or quote horribly funny memes, then how will he know that you\u2019re being real with him?<br/></li><li>He\u2019ll indulge in your meme-ry by sending a funny cat photo he found.<br/></li><li>If you don\u2019t like cats get out<br/></li><li>Nah just kidding.<br/></li><li>But seriously beware of him building a bond with every one he sees.<br/></li><li>Fck if Aizawa loves you, then he\u2019s fcking done<br/></li><li>When you two fight, the silent treatment lasts for days. It\u2019s agonizing and probably worse than death itself.<br/></li><li>You two love each other so much it hurts.<br/></li><li>Like literally your relationship is so strong that it could break stone, diamond, platinum-<br/></li><li>Everything that\u2019s needed in a relationship (honesty, trust, endless devotion) just comes naturally with you two.<br/></li><li>He sees as his literal ray of sunshine bc wow your brighten his mood in like an instant, not that he would tell you. Everyone else sucks but you suck less lol<br/></li><li>There\u2019s no judgement bc you two aren\u2019t about that life.<br/></li><li>If you revealed you had six fingers, he would be like \u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d but in a less rude way.<br/></li><li>You have to have alligator skin to his blunt and frigid comments. He doesn\u2019t sugar coat things.<br/></li><li>He doesn\u2019t think of love often but does not to take it lightly.<br/></li><li>If you are the one, he will be willing to run mountains, cross raging streams, sweat buckets, to be with you. He will be in so deep.<br/></li><li>You tell him his \u201ccreepy\u201d smiles are endearing and he rolls his eyes (and dies a little on the inside).<br/></li><li>Little competitions between you two are fairly common. Tests, staring contests, who can make which person laugh first-you name it. Food is always the prize. So practically an ensured date<br/></li><li>He tends to get possessive when he sees you interact with a \u2018rival\u2019 or someone that makes you laugh uncontrollably. But the most he\u2019ll do is just sit beside you or hold your hand, staring coldly directly in the person\u2019s eyes, while you continue to chatter on. You notice it and pull him aside afterwards, reassuring how you adore him like no one else in pure tenderness.<br/></li><li>Adding on to that, his commitment to you is not to be joked about. If anyone tells him that you\u2019re cheating on him, he tells them that they\u2019re full of shit and just walks away.<br/></li><li>Not a fan of pet names. It leaves a gross taste in his mouth and your name is pretty enough to him.<br/></li><li>Okay maybe \u201cbabe\u201d or \u201clove\u201d but in private.<br/></li><li>A man to show his feelings through action than words. Shinsou believes it way more powerful that way. He\u2019ll pack you that lunch you forgot, saying it was my big deal. He\u2019ll take you on simple dates to the store or mall. If he\u2019s gonna say \u201cI love you\u201d, it\u2019s either saying it straightforward (which is reserved for special occasions) or thoughtful deeds.</li><li>Shinsou\u2019s only used his quirk on you once. It was when you kept insistently asking him what his quirk was and wanted you to shut up. The guy looks back on it now and promises to never use it against your will again.<br/></li><li>He doesn\u2019t believe in awkward silence. Talking is fine with him, but seems to relax when you are just in each other\u2019s prescence, no words spoken at all.<br/></li><li>Run your damn hands through this lavender bed hair, I swear to FCKING GOd<br/></li><li>Shinsou likes to curl around your body and just listen to your heartbeat. It\u2019s one of the only things that can fully put him in a deep sleep.<br/></li><li>In conclusion he\u2019s a keeper. thank you for coming to my ted talk.</li></ul>",
