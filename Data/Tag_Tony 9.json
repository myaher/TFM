        "body": "<p><i>(Fluff, established relationship)</i></p><p>Before Rhodey enlists, he makes a journal named <b>To the person who has Tony Stark\u2019s heart: The Ins and Outs.</b></p><p>Steve finds the journal when going through some old boxes when he comes across the old book with a cape made of leather. Unsure of what to do, he opened the first page, finding a list of too many things writing down.</p><p>He closed the journal fast, willing himself to not open again. There were clear signs of aging through the pages, they were dusty and yellow, some were dented and clearly falling apart. </p><p><b>More under the cut</b></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Steve asked Tony, who was right behind unpacking another box. </p><p>Tony smiled as he looks at the journal, something wistful in his eyes as he took the book from Steve\u2019s hand and caressed it.</p><p>\u201cRhodey wrote for me before enlisting to the Army\u201d he answers, smiling gently. \u201cGo ahead, read it\u201d.</p><p>Steve looked at him, understanding the implications of what he just said. It was dumb, really, because they\u2019ve been together for two years now, but that clear sign of utmost trust made him choke up. </p><p>1. His mother used to makes him cookies whenever he came back from college She kept the recipe in page forty-seven of her old cooking book. He loves it til this day.</p><p>2. He can be Einstein levels of smart, but can also be dumb as a brick. He won\u2019t tell you so, but you should always make sure he isn\u2019t overthinking stupid things</p><p>3. He blows things up. Constantly. He\u2019s the fire department worst nightmare. Long story short, don\u2019t leave him alone with the bots. </p><p>4. He watched a Walk to Remember and cried throughout the entire movie. He was inconsolable when Jamie died. You\u2019re allowed to use this information for bribing.</p><p>5. After watching Titanic for the first time, he created a PowerPoint presentation to prove that Jack and Rose could\u2019ve fit on that door together and ranted for hours about how his death was a money grabbing scheme.</p><p>6. He loves Fini candies. You give him Fini Kisses and he\u2019ll swoon for one whole day.</p><p>7. When we were at MIT, Tony met a boy that sold candies on the side to help his mom with the bills. As soon as he heard about it, Tony bought every single candy the boy brought to college.</p><p>8. He thins The Beatles are overrated. I take no responsibility for this travesty.</p><p>9. He once stole a baby dear while drunk and name it Bambi. Let\u2019s just say that the mother was less than pleased with us.</p><p>10. Tony loves weddings. He truly, truly does. I\u2019m pretty sure he was a wedding planner in another life.</p><p>11. He giggled the first time he tried champagne. It was the most adorable sound I\u2019ve ever heard.\u00a0</p><p>Steve stopped as he turned another page, looking at Tony expectantly. He was more than pleased to see that he knew most of this stuff. Those little quirks that made Tony well\u2026 Tony.</p><p>He knew about all these tiny little details that made Tony the person he was. From the way, he\u2019d drink his coffee to the way he\u2019d snore while asleep. </p><p>Steve skips over a few pages and continues to read through all the things Rhodey wrote.\u00a0</p><p>23. He got addicted to Guaran\u00e1 when he traveled to Brazil and tried to buy the company. Don\u2019t ever take give him that again, trust me.</p><p>24. Tony had a Captain America memorabilia as a child, there are pictures in this old box in his office. Don\u2019t tell him I told you! P.S: He was the cutest little toddler in the whole world.</p><p>25. He procrastinates sometimes, I guess is one of the side effects of being smart as hell.\u00a0</p><p>26. Tony has this persona, I\u2019m sure you know this by now\u2026 He puts up a front, smiles when he has to, but don\u2019t let it fool you, underneath all that act there is a heart of gold.</p><p>And really, Rhodey knew Tony so damn well! He knew him inside out, just like Steve. In moments like these, he could understand how they became friends and how they are still going strong after so many years.</p><p>He goes back to the book, roaming through the pages of everything that defined the man he loved.\u00a0</p><p>39. He is loyal. Seriously, he is incredibly loyal to those around him, and he gives everything he has to his friends and to those he loves. Don\u2019t take advantage of that, or I will hunt you down. That\u2019s a promise.</p><p>40. He carries the weight of the world around his shoulders, and sometimes he needs someone to ease off that weight. I hope you are that person, I truly do.</p><p>41. Loving is like muscle memory for him, it\u2019s ingrained in his DNA. He is Tony Stark, he is Iron Man, and he loves with every fiber of his being.</p><p>42. He donates money for a different institution every year around Christmas. He goes to orphanages and reads to children whenever he can, and it\u2019s a sight to behold.</p><p>43.

Tony can only watch helplessly as the man steals his face and tries to take down the rest of the Avengers in Iron Man&rsquo;s name. To Tony&rsquo;s surprise the team subdues the fake Iron Man in a matter of minutes, referring to a protocol Tony didn&rsquo;t even know existed.\nIt really hurts when he realizes that the team was always prepared to take him down if necessary. Tony knows that they didn&rsquo;t get off to the best start but he never would have expected anything like this.\nDon&rsquo;t the Avengers trust him at all?</p><p>Words: 8502, Chapters: 1/1, Language:

Tony can only watch helplessly as the man steals his face and tries to take down the rest of the Avengers in Iron Man\u2019s name. To Tony\u2019s surprise the team subdues the fake Iron Man in a matter of minutes, referring to a protocol Tony didn\u2019t even know existed.\nIt really hurts when he realizes that the team was always prepared to take him down if necessary. Tony knows that they didn\u2019t get off to the best start but he never would have expected anything like this.\nDon\u2019t the Avengers trust him at all?</p><p>Words: 8502, Chapters: 1/1, Language:

This is such a cool idea.</p>\n\n<p>Trope: \u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d<br/>\n***<br/>\nOn Wednesday afternoons, Peter works in the lab with Mr. Stark.<br/>\nHe doesn\u2019t get much work done this afternoon though. He mostly spends his time dodging the hand that will occasionally dart out to tug on his curls.<br/>\nMr. Stark claims that it\u2019s an experiment to test his spidey sense, but Peter knows that it\u2019s really because he\u2019s overdue for a haircut and the humidity outside has kinked it up into a curly fizzy mess, and Mr. Stark apparently has nothing better else to do then tease him.<br/>\nWithin the past two years of knowing each other, Peter\u2019s spidey sense has long realized that Mr. Stark is no threat, so it says nothing when he\u2019s districted, too busy concentrating on the busted web shooter in front of him, to notice the man walking past. He gets no warning until Mr. Stark yanks on a curl and then gets snagged on it.<br/>\n\u201cOw, Mr. Stark!\u201d Peter complains while Mr. Stark untangles his finger with a guilty smile. Peter shakes his head and runs his own fingers through the overgrown mop, checking for anymore knots. Judging by the look on Mr. Stark\u2019s face, he does nothing but make it more poofy. He sticks his tongue out at the older man.<br/>\n\u201cSorry kid.\u201d Mr. Stark chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone and let you work.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave me alone.\u201d Peter tells him. \u201cJust my hair. Let it live in peace.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Mr. Stark says like it\u2019s the worst request in the world and he\u2019s put out by it. The smirk on his face though, while he sits by Peter and gets to work on his own project, betrays him.<br/>\n***<br/>\nOn a Thursday morning, Peter follows a wizard into space.<br/>\nMr. Stark is in his ear telling him to let go. That he\u2019ll catch him. Peter believes him but he can\u2019t let go. His fingers aren\u2019t working like they should.<br/>\nHe\u2019s a little scared. (He\u2019d rather not go to space today, thank you. He has a chem test in the morning.)<br/>\nHe\u2019s a little ashamed. (He can\u2019t stop thinking about how he failed the one job Mr. Stark gave him.)<br/>\nHe\u2019s a lot lightheaded. (He can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t breathe.)<br/>\nMr. Stark is still in his ear. He sounds calm but Peter knows he\u2019s scared. Sometimes, when Mr. Stark\u2019s scared enough his voice goes all calm like that. Like he\u2019s trying to convince him that everything is under control.<br/>\nPeter eventually let\u2019s go of the spaceship but it\u2019s only when his vision goes black. Mr. Stark catches him though, just like he promised, and Peter wakes up in a brand-new suit.<br/>\nMr. Stark tries to send him home, but the thought of his mentor going alone to the one place he fears the most, makes Peter stick again to the side of the ship.<br/>\nHe\u2019ll be in huge trouble. Mr. Stark may even hate him for purposely putting himself in danger like this, but at least he isn\u2019t heading towards his worst nightmare alone.<br/>\n***<br/>\nOn a Thursday afternoon, Peter dies in Mr. Stark\u2019s arms.<br/>\nPeter\u2019s thought about his own death before. It might be morbid, but death has been following him around since he was six and his parents got a plane and never came back home. And then when Uncle Ben never came home from that 7-11. It leans over his shoulder every time he flings himself off a skyscraper and faces criminals every night.<br/>\nHe always imagined that he\u2019d be brave when it happened. He thought that\u2019d it be peaceful, a little like falling asleep.<br/>\nThat\u2019s not what happens on Titan.<br/>\nHe doesn\u2019t go quietly. He cries and sobs like a little kid. He doesn\u2019t mean to; he wants to be brave, but it\u2019s all happening so fast that he isn\u2019t even sure what\u2019s happening.<br/>\nHe\u2019s hot all over and achy. Is he sick? Or is he turning to dust like the others?<br/>\nPeter stumbles forward towards the only source of comfort he has on this stupid planet and Mr. Stark catches him. He holds him and buries his hand in the matted curls that he was teasing Peter about the other day. He doesn\u2019t let go even when they fall to the ground.<br/>\nThis isn\u2019t how this was supposed to go.<br/>\nPeter looks up at Mr. Stark and apologizes. He\u2019s not entirely sure what he\u2019s sorry for. For not listening and coming to space? For not getting the gauntlet off in time? For dying?<br/>\nApologizing feels right though, like it\u2019s something he needs to say.<br/>\nPeter just barely can say it before he drifts away.<br/>\n***<br/>\nOn a Friday morning, Peter blinks awake.<br/>\nHe thinks it\u2019s Friday, anyway. Or maybe it\u2019s still Thursday? He\u2019s not sure. All he knows is that his head is pounding, and he feels awful.<br/>\nHe\u2019s still on Titan, but he can\u2019t find Mr. Stark. Dr. Strange is there though. He rushes Peter to his unsteady feet and is saying something about how it\u2019s been five years and they\u2019ve got to go help them now, right now.<br/>\nPeter barely gets the chance to catch his breath, let alone process that info bomb, but apparently the fight isn\u2019t over so he tries to get his head on straight.<br/>\nDr. Strange does his yellow sparkly magic and opens a portal to a battlefield. Peter spies a smoking \u2018A\u2019 and his heart sinks with the realization of where they are. It\u2019s the Avengers compound, but it looks like it\u2019s been bombed There\u2019s nothing let but scorched earth and twisted metal.<br/>\nThere\u2019s an army waiting. But they have an army too and Peter doesn\u2019t hesitate to leap into action when Captain America orders them to assemble.<br/>\nHe saves Mr. Stark from the huge alien\u2019s hammer for the second time in just as many days.<br/>\nPeter\u2019s so happy to see him he can\u2019t help but ramble. Mostly because if anyone can explain what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s Mr. Stark. So, Peter rushes to tell him everything because he knows that Mr. Stark likes to have all the facts on these kinds of things. And, in the past, his little tirades were always broken up by the odd quip, teasing, or stray observation from Mr. Stark. But now the man stays quiet. Peter\u2019s honestly not even sure if he\u2019s listening. Mr. Stark is just staring at him really weirdly.<br/>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that gray stuff in your hair?\u201d Peter asks suddenly, surprising himself. He hadn\u2019t meant to say that; he\u2019d just noticed it but now it\u2019s all he can see. He\u2019s pretty sure Mr. Stark\u2019s hair didn\u2019t look like that yesterday.<br/>\nIt\u2019s been five years.<br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gray hair.\u201d Mr. Stark says, and he sounds weird too, like he\u2019s a little out of breath.<br/>\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Peter says, feeling a little stupid, and a lot confused.<br/>\nHe goes to finish his story but Mr. Stark tugs him into a hug before he can. It takes Peter by surprise. Mr. Stark isn\u2019t much of a hugger but you wouldn\u2019t know it based on how tightly he\u2019s holding Peter right now. Peter hugs back just as tightly.<br/>\n\u201cThis is nice.\u201d He whispers. It\u2019s really the only nice thing that\u2019s happened to him since he jumped out of that bus.<br/>\nMr. Stark breathes out a laugh. Then, to Peter\u2019s shock and delight, he presses a kiss to his cheek, firm and gentle. He squeezes Peter one last time before letting go.<br/>\nPeter misses the contact as soon as he steps back but he understands. They have a fight to finish. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for that after they win.<br/>\nHe catches Mr. Stark looking at him weird again, like Peter\u2019s done something amazing by just existing. He shakes his head a little when he realizes that he\u2019s been caught and sniffs.<br/>\n\u201cAlright, Spider-Man.\u201d He says. \u201cLet\u2019s go save the universe.\u201d<br/>\n***<br/>\nPeter doesn\u2019t know what day it really is. He doesn\u2019t even know what year it is anymore.<br/>\nNone of that matters now.<br/>\n\u201cWe did it, Mr. Stark. We won.\u201d Mr. Stark just sits there, eyes empty and staring at nothing. \u201cYou did it, sir. You did it.\u201d<br/>\nHe doesn\u2019t move, doesn\u2019t even twitch when Peter reaches out to him and that\u2019s how Peter knows it\u2019s bad. Mr. Stark is a lot of things but he\u2019s never still. He\u2019s always in motion, body and mind. This isn\u2019t the Tony Stark Peter knows, and it guts him.<br/>\n\u201cPlease, Tony. No.\u201d Peter begs, the first sob escaping him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br/>\nHe doesn\u2019t even try to hold back his tears when Pepper gently pulls him away and hands him over to Rhodey.<br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tony.\u201d He hears Pepper say, and he wants to scream. This isn\u2019t okay. None of this is okay. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can-\u201d<br/>\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence.\u201d Dr. Strange interrupts unexpectedly, stepping out of portal, Captain America right behind him.<br/>\n\u201cWe have to hurry.\u201d He says as Captain America lifts Mr. Starks limp burnt body into his arms. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d<br/>\n***<br/>\nPeter still doesn\u2019t know what day or year it is.<br/>\nAll he knows is that he\u2019s Wakanda. They could have a different calendar year for all he knows.<br/>\nWhat he knows is that he\u2019s never traveling by portals again.<br/>\nHe\u2019s only done it a couple times but so far, they\u2019ve only taken him to only bad things. Like getting beaten up by Thanos. Or the smoking husk of the compound. And now a Wakandan waiting room.<br/>\nIn reality, the waiting room is the best place he could be because it means that Mr. Stark has a fighting chance. And he and everyone else in this room is beyond grateful for that chance because without it Mr. Stark would be dead.<br/>\nThe bad part is the waiting. It\u2019s been three hours since they rushed Mr. Stark into surgery. Peter hit his adrenaline crash an hour ago. He feels like he\u2019s going out of his mind.<br/>\nHis hands shake and he feels sick as he listens to Dr. Strange talk to the room, filling everyone in. He tells them how that everyone Thanos had dusted has been dead for five years. Captain America solemnly confirms it.<br/>\nPeter wonders if Aunt May was one of them. He doesn\u2019t have his phone to even call and check on her.<br/>\nHis nausea ramps up. He was dead for five years. Five years of his life, gone, just like that. With a snap of a finger. He can\u2019t wrap his mind around it. His head swims and he can\u2019t stop seeing Mr. Stark\u2019s empty eyes.<br/>\nThe sound of chair legs screeching across the floor echoes loudly around the room and it takes Peter a moment to realize that he the cause of it. All eyes are on him. He stands, chest heaving but not taking in any air. Dr. Strange and Captain America turn to him like they\u2019re expecting him to say something.<br/>\n\u201cI-\u201d Peter swallows thickly. His stomach churns and he feels like he\u2019s going to puke. \u201cI-I can\u2019t-I gotta-\u201d<br/>\nHe runs from the room and stumbles out into the hallway. He makes it only a few feet before his knees give out. He throws a hand up onto the wall and his powers making his hand stick are the only thing that keeps him somewhat upright. His legs crumple underneath him but the hand that wraps around his elbow saves him from hitting the floor.<br/>\nCaptain America eases him to the floor. He settles Peter against the wall and pushes a small trash can in between his legs. Peter wastes no time heaving into it.<br/>\nNothing comes up though. There\u2019s nothing in his stomach, because until four hours ago, he was dead. His body doesn\u2019t seem to understand that because his stomach still cramps and twists and turns, trying to bring something up.<br/>\n\u201cEasy, Queens.\u201d Cap soothes between gags and once again when Peter finally stops long enough to breathe again. He\u2019s afraid if he opens his mouth, he\u2019ll start up again so he just nods instead and leans his head back against the wall. He closes his eyes. The world spins around him and he floats away in the darkness.<br/>\nHe\u2019s not sure how long he drifts for before a cold, dry hand presses up against his forehead. He flinches away, and the hand settles onto his shoulder instead.<br/>\n\u201cIs he alright?\u201d A voice that\u2019s not Captain America asks above him and Peter cracks open an eye to see the Winter Soldier staring down at him.<br/>\nHe\u2019s in sweatpants and a tee shirt. His long hair is pulled back into a wet bun. It\u2019s one of the most surreal things Peter has ever seen, and that\u2019s saying something. He decides that he\u2019s not in the right frame of mind to handle this and shuts his eyes again.<br/>\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look too good.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s delayed shock, I think.\u201d Cap answers. He pats Peter\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cWould you go ask T\u2019Challa if we can borrow a suite? He needs to lie down.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYou can use mine.\u201d The Winter Soldier offers and Cap breathes a little sigh of relief.<br/>\n\u201cThanks, Buck.\u201d Peter feels Cap shift and when he opens his eyes, he\u2019s kneeling in front of Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, Queens?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cPeter.\u201d He mumbles, still feeling sick.<br/>\n\u201cHi, Peter.\u201d Cap smiles at him. \u201cCan I help you up?\u201d<br/>\nHe nods and then is quickly lifted onto his feet. The hallway spins dangerously around him and he tilts with it. Cap\u2019s grip on him tightens, and he shifts again, taking on most of Peter\u2019s weight.<br/>\nCap leads him to what looks like an apartment. He settles Peter on the couch with strict instructions to get some rest while he gets him something to eat. He uses his PSA voice and everything.<br/>\nJoke\u2019s on him, Peter thinks dizzily as he tips his head back onto the cushions. He\u2019s been immune to the \u201cCaptain America\u201d voice since fifth grade. He stays put but only because he seriously doubts that he could get up under his own power.<br/>\nThe Winter Soldier walks is just as Cap is pressing a grilled cheese and apple juice into Peter\u2019s still shaking hands. Hawkeye, Thor, and weird looking Hulk invite themselves in not too long after. Soon tons of heroes, some Peter knows and some he\u2019s doesn\u2019t, filter in and out asking for updates on Mr. Stark.<br/>\nA few people come up and speak to him but Peter doesn\u2019t reply with much over one- or two-word answers. He really doesn\u2019t feel like talking. He doesn\u2019t mean to be rude. He\u2019s just so tired.<br/>\nCap comes over after a while and drapes a blanket over him as a pointed hint, but Peter doesn\u2019t sleep. He wants- no needs- to be awake and alert. He doesn\u2019t want to miss any updates on Mr. Stark.<br/>\nHe thinks they\u2019ll never hear anything when Happy bursts into the room, like it\u2019s a drug bust or something. All eyes are on him now but Happy ignores them. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d He demands as if Peter\u2019s a hostage or something.<br/>\nPeter goes to answer, but it suddenly stopped short of the sight of the little girl who\u2019s perched on Happy\u2019s hip.<br/>\nPeter hasn\u2019t officially been told about Morgan Stark\u2019s existence. He doesn\u2019t think they kept it from him on purpose or that she\u2019s some kind of big red secret. He truly thinks it hadn\u2019t been a priority, considering the current circumstances and he thinks that everyone just kind of forgot to tell him.<br/>\nHe only found out because he overheard the hushed conversations around him. Overheard the quiet concerned voices asking if she was all right, how she was coping. He saw the photo of a smiling, dark-haired little girl sandwiched between her mom and dad on Pepper\u2019s phone when she pulled him into a hug earlier right after they took Mr. Stark into surgery.<br/>\nMorgan Stark is the ultimate proof that it really has been five years. Because Peter\u2019s pretty sure that he would have noticed if Mr. Stark had a daughter before. And there\u2019s no doubt that that little girl is Tony Stark and Pepper Potts\u2019s daughter. She looks just like Mr. Stark, down the same dark hair and sharp intelligent eyes.<br/>\nThose eyes narrow in on Peter now and he has to suppress a shiver because he\u2019s seen that same intense CEO from Pepper before.<br/>\nShe spots him before Happy does and wiggles out from his hold, running over to Peter. She launches herself up onto the couch beside him and looks him up and down, examining him. Peter tries hard not to squirm underneath her gaze. He must pass some kind of test though because suddenly smiles up at him.<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite superhero!\u201d She exclaims, folding her tiny fingers into her equally tiny palm on hands pointing them at him. It takes her making tiny \u2018 thwip thwip \u2019 sounds for Peter to clue in that she\u2019s talking about him. She pokes at the spider emblem in the middle of his chest. \u201cSecond to Iron Man, of course.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d Peter agrees weakly. He\u2019s honestly not sure of what else to say. His brain is beyond fired at this point. The whole thing is overwhelming.<br/>\nWhen Peter started the day: it was 2018. He was a junior and Mr. Stark didn\u2019t have kids, that he knew of. Now, somehow: It\u2019s 2023. Peter\u2019s been dead and Mr. Stark has a wife, kid, and a whole life that doesn\u2019t include Peter.<br/>\nIt\u2019s all too much. His head hurts. His whole body aches. It feels like someone is squeezing his heart too tight.<br/>\nHe feels like he\u2019s on the verge of a complete, utter breakdown.<br/>\nMorgan doesn\u2019t notice, she\u2019s too busy babbling away to notice that he\u2019s having a crisis, but the adults don\u2019t miss it. Happy and Cap walk over and Cap hovers like a mother hen while Happy scoops Morgan back into his arms.<br/>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just bombard people like that, little miss.\u201d Happy lightly chastises. \u201cGive him some space.\u201d<br/>\nMorgan pouts and it\u2019s easily the cutest thing Peter\u2019s ever seen.\u201cBut daddy said that he\u2019s my big brother. That means it\u2019s his job to listen to my stories.\u201d<br/>\nSomething deep inside Peter snaps. But not in a breaking sort of way. No, it\u2019s more like something snaps into place. Like something clicks in Peter\u2019s scrambled brain.<br/>\nThat\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s daughter.<br/>\nAnd, yeah, okay, he already knew that, but in that moment it really hits home.<br/>\nThat\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s daughter. His baby. And she knows Peter. She called him her big brother. Peter has been dead for five years, her entire life, but Mr. Stark told her about him. He included him.<br/>\nThe wave of emotion that crashes over him steals his breath. It\u2019s love, but fierce and more protective that anything he\u2019s ever felt before. Peter knows, right then and there, that he\u2019d do anything for Morgan Stark.<br/>\nPeter reaches back for her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d He tells Happy. He sounds horrible, like his vocal cords have been through a wood chipper. Even Happy and Cap wince at it. He briefly remembers getting choked out by Thanos but quickly shakes the memory away.<br/>\nHappy doesn\u2019t so much as hand Morgan over as she throws herself at Peter when she decides that Happy isn\u2019t moving quick enough. She wraps around Peter and buries her little face into his neck.<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back to meet me.\u201d She whispers and Peter loses it.<br/>\nTears fill up his eyes, hot and fast, and he doesn\u2019t even attempt to stop them. Wiping them away would mean letting go of Morgan and he refuses to do that. So, he just stares up at the ceiling and lets them silently fall. They steadily drip down his face and into Morgan\u2019s hair, until a calloused hand swipes some away. Peter blinks up at Happy as he steps into his line of vision.<br/>\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s how I acted the first time I held her too.\u201d He says gruffly, like he\u2019s holding back tears of his own. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cHey, Happy.\u201d Peter sniffles.<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some good news.\u201d Happy says, ruffling Peter\u2019s matted hair before just resting his hand on top of it. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to May. She\u2019s on her way right now. She sends her love.\u201d<br/>\nPeter nods, still sniffling. Just knowing that May is all right and that he\u2019ll see her soon takes a huge weight off of him.<br/>\n\u201cAnd Boss is out of surgery. The doctors say that he\u2019s doing great. He\u2019s down an arm but other than that, he\u2019ll be back home in no time.\u201d<br/>\nWith no warning, Peter busts into full-blown, relieved sobs. He guessed he didn\u2019t realize how worried he\u2019d been that Mr. Stark wouldn\u2019t pull through. His sobs are too loud in the now quiet room but Peter can\u2019t stop.<br/>\nGod, he really is a mess.<br/>\n\u201cDo you want to go see him?\u201d Happy asks over the sounds of Peter\u2019s meltdown and Peter nods so quickly that he almost gives himself whiplash. Happy goes to take Morgan but the little girl holds onto Peter tighter, so he just heaves the both of them up off the couch and follows Happy out.<br/>\nShe doesn\u2019t let go until they get outside of Mr. Stark\u2019s room. Then she abandons him as soon as she sees Pepper, who\u2019s waiting for them along with Rhodey. Pepper holds her close for a moment then pulls Peter into their embrace. She kisses Morgan\u2019s forehead then presses one against Peter\u2019s temple.<br/>\n\u201cDad will be fine.\u201d Pepper says, her eyes shining. The wording makes it seems like the message is for Morgan but Pepper makes eye contact with Peter too. \u201cHe\u2019s just really tired right now, so we have to be gentle and quiet. Ok?\u201d<br/>\nMorgan nods solemnly then elbows Peter to do the same. He does and doesn\u2019t miss the smile that all three adults share. Rhodey opens the door and they all step in together, but Peter stops at the doorway, frozen.<br/>\nHis breath catches in happiness? Relief? Peter\u2019s not sure. All he knows is this is a vast improvement over the last time he saw Mr. Stark. So much so that Peter wonders if that was even Mr. Stark out on that battlefield.<br/>\nLife sparks in his eyes as he reaches out for his daughter. He looks so much better, it\u2019s amazing. The left side of his face is still eaten up with burns but they look several days old now instead of just hours. His left arm has been replaced with a sleek looking red and gold prosthetic.<br/>\nPeter watches as Morgan crawls up the bed towards her dada until they\u2019re nose to nose. She smacks both her palms against his cheeks, as gently as a four-year-old can manage, Peter guesses, and frames his face. Mr. Stark beams at her.<br/>\n\u201cHey, Morgana.\u201d He greets her causally, like he\u2019s just come back from buying groceries and not death\u2019s door. He uses his flesh hand to brush away some stray baby hair from her face. \u201cMiss me?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cThree thousand.\u201d She answers and, Peter doesn\u2019t get it, but the adults absolute melt around him. They all give watery laughs. It must be an inside joke he\u2019s missed out on.<br/>\nThe bitterness that come with the thought, is unexpected and chokes him. This is a happy moment, one he\u2019s been praying for since he got to Wakanda, and he doesn\u2019t want to ruin it with his bad attitude. He blinks back the tears that have cropped up again and tries to discreetly back out of the open door. But just as he thinks he\u2019s home free, Mr. Stark calls out to him.<br/>\n\u201cPete?\u201d Even his voice sounds so much better. It\u2019s still weak, but it\u2019s no longer the dying rasp that had gasped out his wife\u2019s name.<br/>\nSobs rip through Peter before he can stop them. He tries to smother them, covering his face with his hands, but he can\u2019t stop. His whole-body shakes with the effort. He\u2019s still self-aware enough to be embarrassed though. This is his second breakdown of the day. The literal child in the room is handing the situation better than he is.<br/>\nHe just stands there crying like a baby until hands land on his shoulders and gently lead him away. He assumes that he\u2019s being taken out of the room until his knees knock against the metal frame of Mr. Stark\u2019s hospital bed. The hands that brought he here, give him an encouraging pat on the head and<br/>\nPeter hears everyone file out of the room, leaving him and Mr. Stark alone.<br/>\n\u201cPeter?\u201d He hears Mr. Stark say over his blubbering. \u201cThink you could move your hands for me, bud? I really want to see those big ole Bambi eyes of yours. Especially considering I figured out time travel to see them again.\u201d<br/>\nHe knows that Mr. Stark is trying to lighten the mood, trying to get Peter to laugh instead of having continuous meltdowns, but Peter\u2019s brain gets tripped up on the fact that Mr. Stark just said that he figured out time travel for him and he keeps wailing instead.<br/>\n\u201cOh, Pete.\u201d Mr. Stark blows out a breath. \u201cOk, alright. You\u2019re okay, bud. Come here.\u201d<br/>\nHe tugs at Peter\u2019s shoulders until he gets the hint and climbs up onto the bed. Once he\u2019s up there, Peter wastes no time curling around his mentor. He clings to Mr. Stark just as tightly as Morgan had to him. Mr. Stark\u2019s arms circle around him, his flesh one curling in his hair and the metal one cold against the back of his neck.<br/>\n\u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d Peter hiccups and Mr. Stark\u2019s chest hitches underneath him. He rocks them back and forth.<br/>\n\u201cI know, bud. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mr. Stark soothes. \u201cI\u2019m here now though. We\u2019re okay. Everything is okay.\u201d<br/>\nThey sit huddled together, swaying in silence for a while. Peter breaks the silence a few minutes later when he whispers the one thing that\u2019s been eating at him since he woke on Titan to Mr. Stark missing and Dr. Strange yelling instructions.<br/>\n\u201cI was dead.\u201d<br/>\nSaying it out loud doesn\u2019t make Peter feel any better like he thought it would. There\u2019s no rushing epiphany that comes to him or even the denial from Mr. Stark that he\u2019d been secretly wishing for.<br/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Is the only thing that Mr. Stark says after a long moment. He sounds confident though. Confident and sure in a way that Peter doesn\u2019t think he could ever be. He sounds every bit the hero that Peter\u2019s looked up almost his whole life. \u201cWe\u2019re both here now and that\u2019s all that matters. We\u2019ll figure out the semantics later.\u201d<br/>\nPeter isn\u2019t sure, but he decides to trusts Mr. Stark anyway.<br/>\n***<br/>\nOn a Saturday morning, Peter attends the Black Widow\u2019s funeral.<br/>\nHe watches as Cap lowers down a decorated wreath into the lake. It\u2019s full of photos, parting gifts from her fans and her found family, her widow bites, and a bundle of fan mail from the countless of people she\u2019d saved throughout the years.<br/>\nPeter never met her properly, Mr. Stark said that Germany didn\u2019t count, but he stands out on the dock of the lake house with the other Avengers and pays his respects. She made the ultimate sacrifice to give him the chance to be here, and he thanks her for it.<br/>\n(Peter\u2019s spider drone sits by her widow bites. Mr. Stark had insisted.<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good kid, Pete.\u201d Mr. Stark had sniffed when Peter had asked if they could include it. \u201cShe would have loved you.\u201d)<br/>\nThe water accepts their tribute and the mourners slowly drift away.<br/>\nA little while later, Mr. Stark finds him sitting alone at a picnic table picking at the wood.<br/>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Pete?\u201d<br/>\nPeter\u2019s stomach twists with guilt. It should be the other way around; him checking on Mr. Stark. They\u2019re at his friend\u2019s funeral. It\u2019s Mr. Stark, not Peter, who grimaces as he gently lowers himself onto the seat beside Peter because his burns still bother him some days.<br/>\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Peter finally says after a moment. A piece of table gives underneath his finger nail. \u201cJust tired.\u201d<br/>\nIt\u2019s not a complete lie. He is tired. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s had a full night\u2019s rest since he\u2019s been back. Mr. Stark invited him and May to stay with them during the summer and he\u2019s hoping it\u2019ll help.<br/>\nThe thing is, adjusting to everything has been harder than what he thought it\u2019d be. It seems like the universe is still reeling. It\u2019s struggling to find a place for half the population that it\u2019d mourned and moved on from.<br/>\nHalf of his classmates are in college. He\u2019s lucky that he still has Ned and MJ to navigate what\u2019s sure to be the weirdest senior year ever, but he can\u2019t help the twinge of bitterness that jumps in his throat when he scrolls through Instagram and sees the life he could have been living.<br/>\nPeter knows that he should just be grateful that he\u2019s alive. He\u2019s owns everything to Mr. Stark and to the Avengers. He should be happy.<br/>\nSo why does he feel so lost? Why can\u2019t he sleep? Why does he get so angry sometimes for no reason?<br/>\nMr. Stark just narrows his eyes at him, no doubt easily seeing right through him, but thankfully says nothing. Instead, he wraps his good arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders and pulls him close. He presses their heads together and they just breath for a moment.<br/>\n\u201cI love you, Pete.\u201d<br/>\nSomehow, Peter\u2019s able push past the lump that\u2019s lodged itself in his throat to say:<br/>\n\u201cI love you too, Mr. Stark.<br/>\n***<br/>\nOn a Saturday afternoon, after Peter dies and then comes back to life, Mr. Stark tells Peter that he loves him for the first time and Peter lets himself believe that thing may turn out all right.</p>",

            "comment": "<p>Thanks to @irondadbingo for all their hard work! This is such a cool idea.</p>\n\n<p>Trope: \u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d<br>\n***<br>\nOn Wednesday afternoons, Peter works in the lab with Mr. Stark.<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t get much work done this afternoon though. He mostly spends his time dodging the hand that will occasionally dart out to tug on his curls.<br>\nMr. Stark claims that it\u2019s an experiment to test his spidey sense, but Peter knows that it\u2019s really because he\u2019s overdue for a haircut and the humidity outside has kinked it up into a curly fizzy mess, and Mr. Stark apparently has nothing better else to do then tease him.<br>\nWithin the past two years of knowing each other, Peter\u2019s spidey sense has long realized that Mr. Stark is no threat, so it says nothing when he\u2019s districted, too busy concentrating on the busted web shooter in front of him, to notice the man walking past. He gets no warning until Mr. Stark yanks on a curl and then gets snagged on it.<br>\n\u201cOw, Mr. Stark!\u201d Peter complains while Mr. Stark untangles his finger with a guilty smile. Peter shakes his head and runs his own fingers through the overgrown mop, checking for anymore knots. Judging by the look on Mr. Stark\u2019s face, he does nothing but make it more poofy. He sticks his tongue out at the older man.<br>\n\u201cSorry kid.\u201d Mr. Stark chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone and let you work.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave me alone.\u201d Peter tells him. \u201cJust my hair. Let it live in peace.\u201d<br>\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Mr. Stark says like it\u2019s the worst request in the world and he\u2019s put out by it. The smirk on his face though, while he sits by Peter and gets to work on his own project, betrays him.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Thursday morning, Peter follows a wizard into space.<br>\nMr. Stark is in his ear telling him to let go. That he\u2019ll catch him. Peter believes him but he can\u2019t let go. His fingers aren\u2019t working like they should.<br>\nHe\u2019s a little scared. (He\u2019d rather not go to space today, thank you. He has a chem test in the morning.)<br>\nHe\u2019s a little ashamed. (He can\u2019t stop thinking about how he failed the one job Mr. Stark gave him.)<br>\nHe\u2019s a lot lightheaded. (He can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t breathe.)<br>\nMr. Stark is still in his ear. He sounds calm but Peter knows he\u2019s scared. Sometimes, when Mr. Stark\u2019s scared enough his voice goes all calm like that. Like he\u2019s trying to convince him that everything is under control.<br>\nPeter eventually let\u2019s go of the spaceship but it\u2019s only when his vision goes black. Mr. Stark catches him though, just like he promised, and Peter wakes up in a brand-new suit.<br>\nMr. Stark tries to send him home, but the thought of his mentor going alone to the one place he fears the most, makes Peter stick again to the side of the ship.<br>\nHe\u2019ll be in huge trouble. Mr. Stark may even hate him for purposely putting himself in danger like this, but at least he isn\u2019t heading towards his worst nightmare alone.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Thursday afternoon, Peter dies in Mr. Stark\u2019s arms.<br>\nPeter\u2019s thought about his own death before. It might be morbid, but death has been following him around since he was six and his parents got a plane and never came back home. And then when Uncle Ben never came home from that 7-11. It leans over his shoulder every time he flings himself off a skyscraper and faces criminals every night.<br>\nHe always imagined that he\u2019d be brave when it happened. He thought that\u2019d it be peaceful, a little like falling asleep.<br>\nThat\u2019s not what happens on Titan.<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t go quietly. He cries and sobs like a little kid. He doesn\u2019t mean to; he wants to be brave, but it\u2019s all happening so fast that he isn\u2019t even sure what\u2019s happening.<br>\nHe\u2019s hot all over and achy. Is he sick? Or is he turning to dust like the others?<br>\nPeter stumbles forward towards the only source of comfort he has on this stupid planet and Mr. Stark catches him. He holds him and buries his hand in the matted curls that he was teasing Peter about the other day. He doesn\u2019t let go even when they fall to the ground.<br>\nThis isn\u2019t how this was supposed to go.<br>\nPeter looks up at Mr. Stark and apologizes. He\u2019s not entirely sure what he\u2019s sorry for. For not listening and coming to space? For not getting the gauntlet off in time? For dying?<br>\nApologizing feels right though, like it\u2019s something he needs to say.<br>\nPeter just barely can say it before he drifts away.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Friday morning, Peter blinks awake.<br>\nHe thinks it\u2019s Friday, anyway. Or maybe it\u2019s still Thursday? He\u2019s not sure. All he knows is that his head is pounding, and he feels awful.<br>\nHe\u2019s still on Titan, but he can\u2019t find Mr. Stark. Dr. Strange is there though. He rushes Peter to his unsteady feet and is saying something about how it\u2019s been five years and they\u2019ve got to go help them now, right now.<br>\nPeter barely gets the chance to catch his breath, let alone process that info bomb, but apparently the fight isn\u2019t over so he tries to get his head on straight.<br>\nDr. Strange does his yellow sparkly magic and opens a portal to a battlefield. Peter spies a smoking \u2018A\u2019 and his heart sinks with the realization of where they are. It\u2019s the Avengers compound, but it looks like it\u2019s been bombed There\u2019s nothing let but scorched earth and twisted metal.<br>\nThere\u2019s an army waiting. But they have an army too and Peter doesn\u2019t hesitate to leap into action when Captain America orders them to assemble.<br>\nHe saves Mr. Stark from the huge alien\u2019s hammer for the second time in just as many days.<br>\nPeter\u2019s so happy to see him he can\u2019t help but ramble. Mostly because if anyone can explain what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s Mr. Stark. So, Peter rushes to tell him everything because he knows that Mr. Stark likes to have all the facts on these kinds of things. And, in the past, his little tirades were always broken up by the odd quip, teasing, or stray observation from Mr. Stark. But now the man stays quiet. Peter\u2019s honestly not even sure if he\u2019s listening. Mr. Stark is just staring at him really weirdly.<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that gray stuff in your hair?\u201d Peter asks suddenly, surprising himself. He hadn\u2019t meant to say that; he\u2019d just noticed it but now it\u2019s all he can see. He\u2019s pretty sure Mr. Stark\u2019s hair didn\u2019t look like that yesterday.<br>\nIt\u2019s been five years.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gray hair.\u201d Mr. Stark says, and he sounds weird too, like he\u2019s a little out of breath.<br>\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Peter says, feeling a little stupid, and a lot confused.<br>\nHe goes to finish his story but Mr. Stark tugs him into a hug before he can. It takes Peter by surprise. Mr. Stark isn\u2019t much of a hugger but you wouldn\u2019t know it based on how tightly he\u2019s holding Peter right now. Peter hugs back just as tightly.<br>\n\u201cThis is nice.\u201d He whispers. It\u2019s really the only nice thing that\u2019s happened to him since he jumped out of that bus.<br>\nMr. Stark breathes out a laugh. Then, to Peter\u2019s shock and delight, he presses a kiss to his cheek, firm and gentle. He squeezes Peter one last time before letting go.<br>\nPeter misses the contact as soon as he steps back but he understands. They have a fight to finish. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for that after they win.<br>\nHe catches Mr. Stark looking at him weird again, like Peter\u2019s done something amazing by just existing. He shakes his head a little when he realizes that he\u2019s been caught and sniffs.<br>\n\u201cAlright, Spider-Man.\u201d He says. \u201cLet\u2019s go save the universe.\u201d<br>\n***<br>\nPeter doesn\u2019t know what day it really is. He doesn\u2019t even know what year it is anymore.<br>\nNone of that matters now.<br>\n\u201cWe did it, Mr. Stark. We won.\u201d Mr. Stark just sits there, eyes empty and staring at nothing. \u201cYou did it, sir. You did it.\u201d<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t move, doesn\u2019t even twitch when Peter reaches out to him and that\u2019s how Peter knows it\u2019s bad. Mr. Stark is a lot of things but he\u2019s never still. He\u2019s always in motion, body and mind. This isn\u2019t the Tony Stark Peter knows, and it guts him.<br>\n\u201cPlease, Tony. No.\u201d Peter begs, the first sob escaping him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t even try to hold back his tears when Pepper gently pulls him away and hands him over to Rhodey.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tony.\u201d He hears Pepper say, and he wants to scream. This isn\u2019t okay. None of this is okay. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can-\u201d<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence.\u201d Dr. Strange interrupts unexpectedly, stepping out of portal, Captain America right behind him.<br>\n\u201cWe have to hurry.\u201d He says as Captain America lifts Mr. Starks limp burnt body into his arms. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d<br>\n***<br>\nPeter still doesn\u2019t know what day or year it is.<br>\nAll he knows is that he\u2019s Wakanda. They could have a different calendar year for all he knows.<br>\nWhat he knows is that he\u2019s never traveling by portals again.<br>\nHe\u2019s only done it a couple times but so far, they\u2019ve only taken him to only bad things. Like getting beaten up by Thanos. Or the smoking husk of the compound. And now a Wakandan waiting room.<br>\nIn reality, the waiting room is the best place he could be because it means that Mr. Stark has a fighting chance. And he and everyone else in this room is beyond grateful for that chance because without it Mr. Stark would be dead.<br>\nThe bad part is the waiting. It\u2019s been three hours since they rushed Mr. Stark into surgery. Peter hit his adrenaline crash an hour ago. He feels like he\u2019s going out of his mind.<br>\nHis hands shake and he feels sick as he listens to Dr. Strange talk to the room, filling everyone in. He tells them how that everyone Thanos had dusted has been dead for five years. Captain America solemnly confirms it.<br>\nPeter wonders if Aunt May was one of them. He doesn\u2019t have his phone to even call and check on her.<br>\nHis nausea ramps up. He was dead for five years. Five years of his life, gone, just like that. With a snap of a finger. He can\u2019t wrap his mind around it. His head swims and he can\u2019t stop seeing Mr. Stark\u2019s empty eyes.<br>\nThe sound of chair legs screeching across the floor echoes loudly around the room and it takes Peter a moment to realize that he the cause of it. All eyes are on him. He stands, chest heaving but not taking in any air. Dr. Strange and Captain America turn to him like they\u2019re expecting him to say something.<br>\n\u201cI-\u201d Peter swallows thickly. His stomach churns and he feels like he\u2019s going to puke. \u201cI-I can\u2019t-I gotta-\u201d<br>\nHe runs from the room and stumbles out into the hallway. He makes it only a few feet before his knees give out. He throws a hand up onto the wall and his powers making his hand stick are the only thing that keeps him somewhat upright. His legs crumple underneath him but the hand that wraps around his elbow saves him from hitting the floor.<br>\nCaptain America eases him to the floor. He settles Peter against the wall and pushes a small trash can in between his legs. Peter wastes no time heaving into it.<br>\nNothing comes up though. There\u2019s nothing in his stomach, because until four hours ago, he was dead. His body doesn\u2019t seem to understand that because his stomach still cramps and twists and turns, trying to bring something up.<br>\n\u201cEasy, Queens.\u201d Cap soothes between gags and once again when Peter finally stops long enough to breathe again. He\u2019s afraid if he opens his mouth, he\u2019ll start up again so he just nods instead and leans his head back against the wall. He closes his eyes. The world spins around him and he floats away in the darkness.<br>\nHe\u2019s not sure how long he drifts for before a cold, dry hand presses up against his forehead. He flinches away, and the hand settles onto his shoulder instead.<br>\n\u201cIs he alright?\u201d A voice that\u2019s not Captain America asks above him and Peter cracks open an eye to see the Winter Soldier staring down at him.<br>\nHe\u2019s in sweatpants and a tee shirt. His long hair is pulled back into a wet bun. It\u2019s one of the most surreal things Peter has ever seen, and that\u2019s saying something. He decides that he\u2019s not in the right frame of mind to handle this and shuts his eyes again.<br>\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look too good.\u201d<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s delayed shock, I think.\u201d Cap answers. He pats Peter\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cWould you go ask T\u2019Challa if we can borrow a suite? He needs to lie down.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou can use mine.\u201d The Winter Soldier offers and Cap breathes a little sigh of relief.<br>\n\u201cThanks, Buck.\u201d Peter feels Cap shift and when he opens his eyes, he\u2019s kneeling in front of Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, Queens?\u201d<br>\n\u201cPeter.\u201d He mumbles, still feeling sick.<br>\n\u201cHi, Peter.\u201d Cap smiles at him. \u201cCan I help you up?\u201d<br>\nHe nods and then is quickly lifted onto his feet. The hallway spins dangerously around him and he tilts with it. Cap\u2019s grip on him tightens, and he shifts again, taking on most of Peter\u2019s weight.<br>\nCap leads him to what looks like an apartment. He settles Peter on the couch with strict instructions to get some rest while he gets him something to eat. He uses his PSA voice and everything.<br>\nJoke\u2019s on him, Peter thinks dizzily as he tips his head back onto the cushions. He\u2019s been immune to the \u201cCaptain America\u201d voice since fifth grade. He stays put but only because he seriously doubts that he could get up under his own power.<br>\nThe Winter Soldier walks is just as Cap is pressing a grilled cheese and apple juice into Peter\u2019s still shaking hands. Hawkeye, Thor, and weird looking Hulk invite themselves in not too long after. Soon tons of heroes, some Peter knows and some he\u2019s doesn\u2019t, filter in and out asking for updates on Mr. Stark.<br>\nA few people come up and speak to him but Peter doesn\u2019t reply with much over one- or two-word answers. He really doesn\u2019t feel like talking. He doesn\u2019t mean to be rude. He\u2019s just so tired.<br>\nCap comes over after a while and drapes a blanket over him as a pointed hint, but Peter doesn\u2019t sleep. He wants- no needs- to be awake and alert. He doesn\u2019t want to miss any updates on Mr. Stark.<br>\nHe thinks they\u2019ll never hear anything when Happy bursts into the room, like it\u2019s a drug bust or something. All eyes are on him now but Happy ignores them. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d He demands as if Peter\u2019s a hostage or something.<br>\nPeter goes to answer, but it suddenly stopped short of the sight of the little girl who\u2019s perched on Happy\u2019s hip.<br>\nPeter hasn\u2019t officially been told about Morgan Stark\u2019s existence. He doesn\u2019t think they kept it from him on purpose or that she\u2019s some kind of big red secret. He truly thinks it hadn\u2019t been a priority, considering the current circumstances and he thinks that everyone just kind of forgot to tell him.<br>\nHe only found out because he overheard the hushed conversations around him. Overheard the quiet concerned voices asking if she was all right, how she was coping. He saw the photo of a smiling, dark-haired little girl sandwiched between her mom and dad on Pepper\u2019s phone when she pulled him into a hug earlier right after they took Mr. Stark into surgery.<br>\nMorgan Stark is the ultimate proof that it really has been five years. Because Peter\u2019s pretty sure that he would have noticed if Mr. Stark had a daughter before. And there\u2019s no doubt that that little girl is Tony Stark and Pepper Potts\u2019s daughter. She looks just like Mr. Stark, down the same dark hair and sharp intelligent eyes.<br>\nThose eyes narrow in on Peter now and he has to suppress a shiver because he\u2019s seen that same intense CEO from Pepper before.<br>\nShe spots him before Happy does and wiggles out from his hold, running over to Peter. She launches herself up onto the couch beside him and looks him up and down, examining him. Peter tries hard not to squirm underneath her gaze. He must pass some kind of test though because suddenly smiles up at him.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite superhero!\u201d She exclaims, folding her tiny fingers into her equally tiny palm on hands pointing them at him. It takes her making tiny \u2018 thwip thwip \u2019 sounds for Peter to clue in that she\u2019s talking about him. She pokes at the spider emblem in the middle of his chest. \u201cSecond to Iron Man, of course.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d Peter agrees weakly. He\u2019s honestly not sure of what else to say. His brain is beyond fired at this point. The whole thing is overwhelming.<br>\nWhen Peter started the day: it was 2018. He was a junior and Mr. Stark didn\u2019t have kids, that he knew of. Now, somehow: It\u2019s 2023. Peter\u2019s been dead and Mr. Stark has a wife, kid, and a whole life that doesn\u2019t include Peter.<br>\nIt\u2019s all too much. His head hurts. His whole body aches. It feels like someone is squeezing his heart too tight.<br>\nHe feels like he\u2019s on the verge of a complete, utter breakdown.<br>\nMorgan doesn\u2019t notice, she\u2019s too busy babbling away to notice that he\u2019s having a crisis, but the adults don\u2019t miss it. Happy and Cap walk over and Cap hovers like a mother hen while Happy scoops Morgan back into his arms.<br>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just bombard people like that, little miss.\u201d Happy lightly chastises. \u201cGive him some space.\u201d<br>\nMorgan pouts and it\u2019s easily the cutest thing Peter\u2019s ever seen.\u201cBut daddy said that he\u2019s my big brother. That means it\u2019s his job to listen to my stories.\u201d<br>\nSomething deep inside Peter snaps. But not in a breaking sort of way. No, it\u2019s more like something snaps into place. Like something clicks in Peter\u2019s scrambled brain.<br>\nThat\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s daughter.<br>\nAnd, yeah, okay, he already knew that, but in that moment it really hits home.<br>\nThat\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s daughter. His baby. And she knows Peter. She called him her big brother. Peter has been dead for five years, her entire life, but Mr. Stark told her about him. He included him.<br>\nThe wave of emotion that crashes over him steals his breath. It\u2019s love, but fierce and more protective that anything he\u2019s ever felt before. Peter knows, right then and there, that he\u2019d do anything for Morgan Stark.<br>\nPeter reaches back for her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d He tells Happy. He sounds horrible, like his vocal cords have been through a wood chipper. Even Happy and Cap wince at it. He briefly remembers getting choked out by Thanos but quickly shakes the memory away.<br>\nHappy doesn\u2019t so much as hand Morgan over as she throws herself at Peter when she decides that Happy isn\u2019t moving quick enough. She wraps around Peter and buries her little face into his neck.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back to meet me.\u201d She whispers and Peter loses it.<br>\nTears fill up his eyes, hot and fast, and he doesn\u2019t even attempt to stop them. Wiping them away would mean letting go of Morgan and he refuses to do that. So, he just stares up at the ceiling and lets them silently fall. They steadily drip down his face and into Morgan\u2019s hair, until a calloused hand swipes some away. Peter blinks up at Happy as he steps into his line of vision.<br>\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s how I acted the first time I held her too.\u201d He says gruffly, like he\u2019s holding back tears of his own. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d<br>\n\u201cHey, Happy.\u201d Peter sniffles.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some good news.\u201d Happy says, ruffling Peter\u2019s matted hair before just resting his hand on top of it. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to May. She\u2019s on her way right now. She sends her love.\u201d<br>\nPeter nods, still sniffling. Just knowing that May is all right and that he\u2019ll see her soon takes a huge weight off of him.<br>\n\u201cAnd Boss is out of surgery. The doctors say that he\u2019s doing great. He\u2019s down an arm but other than that, he\u2019ll be back home in no time.\u201d<br>\nWith no warning, Peter busts into full-blown, relieved sobs. He guessed he didn\u2019t realize how worried he\u2019d been that Mr. Stark wouldn\u2019t pull through. His sobs are too loud in the now quiet room but Peter can\u2019t stop.<br>\nGod, he really is a mess.<br>\n\u201cDo you want to go see him?\u201d Happy asks over the sounds of Peter\u2019s meltdown and Peter nods so quickly that he almost gives himself whiplash. Happy goes to take Morgan but the little girl holds onto Peter tighter, so he just heaves the both of them up off the couch and follows Happy out.<br>\nShe doesn\u2019t let go until they get outside of Mr. Stark\u2019s room. Then she abandons him as soon as she sees Pepper, who\u2019s waiting for them along with Rhodey. Pepper holds her close for a moment then pulls Peter into their embrace. She kisses Morgan\u2019s forehead then presses one against Peter\u2019s temple.<br>\n\u201cDad will be fine.\u201d Pepper says, her eyes shining. The wording makes it seems like the message is for Morgan but Pepper makes eye contact with Peter too. \u201cHe\u2019s just really tired right now, so we have to be gentle and quiet. Ok?\u201d<br>\nMorgan nods solemnly then elbows Peter to do the same. He does and doesn\u2019t miss the smile that all three adults share. Rhodey opens the door and they all step in together, but Peter stops at the doorway, frozen.<br>\nHis breath catches in happiness? Relief? Peter\u2019s not sure. All he knows is this is a vast improvement over the last time he saw Mr. Stark. So much so that Peter wonders if that was even Mr. Stark out on that battlefield.<br>\nLife sparks in his eyes as he reaches out for his daughter. He looks so much better, it\u2019s amazing. The left side of his face is still eaten up with burns but they look several days old now instead of just hours. His left arm has been replaced with a sleek looking red and gold prosthetic.<br>\nPeter watches as Morgan crawls up the bed towards her dada until they\u2019re nose to nose. She smacks both her palms against his cheeks, as gently as a four-year-old can manage, Peter guesses, and frames his face. Mr. Stark beams at her.<br>\n\u201cHey, Morgana.\u201d He greets her causally, like he\u2019s just come back from buying groceries and not death\u2019s door. He uses his flesh hand to brush away some stray baby hair from her face. \u201cMiss me?\u201d<br>\n\u201cThree thousand.\u201d She answers and, Peter doesn\u2019t get it, but the adults absolute melt around him. They all give watery laughs. It must be an inside joke he\u2019s missed out on.<br>\nThe bitterness that come with the thought, is unexpected and chokes him. This is a happy moment, one he\u2019s been praying for since he got to Wakanda, and he doesn\u2019t want to ruin it with his bad attitude. He blinks back the tears that have cropped up again and tries to discreetly back out of the open door. But just as he thinks he\u2019s home free, Mr. Stark calls out to him.<br>\n\u201cPete?\u201d Even his voice sounds so much better. It\u2019s still weak, but it\u2019s no longer the dying rasp that had gasped out his wife\u2019s name.<br>\nSobs rip through Peter before he can stop them. He tries to smother them, covering his face with his hands, but he can\u2019t stop. His whole-body shakes with the effort. He\u2019s still self-aware enough to be embarrassed though. This is his second breakdown of the day. The literal child in the room is handing the situation better than he is.<br>\nHe just stands there crying like a baby until hands land on his shoulders and gently lead him away. He assumes that he\u2019s being taken out of the room until his knees knock against the metal frame of Mr. Stark\u2019s hospital bed. The hands that brought he here, give him an encouraging pat on the head and<br>\nPeter hears everyone file out of the room, leaving him and Mr. Stark alone.<br>\n\u201cPeter?\u201d He hears Mr. Stark say over his blubbering. \u201cThink you could move your hands for me, bud? I really want to see those big ole Bambi eyes of yours. Especially considering I figured out time travel to see them again.\u201d<br>\nHe knows that Mr. Stark is trying to lighten the mood, trying to get Peter to laugh instead of having continuous meltdowns, but Peter\u2019s brain gets tripped up on the fact that Mr. Stark just said that he figured out time travel for him and he keeps wailing instead.<br>\n\u201cOh, Pete.\u201d Mr. Stark blows out a breath. \u201cOk, alright. You\u2019re okay, bud. Come here.\u201d<br>\nHe tugs at Peter\u2019s shoulders until he gets the hint and climbs up onto the bed. Once he\u2019s up there, Peter wastes no time curling around his mentor. He clings to Mr. Stark just as tightly as Morgan had to him. Mr. Stark\u2019s arms circle around him, his flesh one curling in his hair and the metal one cold against the back of his neck.<br>\n\u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d Peter hiccups and Mr. Stark\u2019s chest hitches underneath him. He rocks them back and forth.<br>\n\u201cI know, bud. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mr. Stark soothes. \u201cI\u2019m here now though. We\u2019re okay. Everything is okay.\u201d<br>\nThey sit huddled together, swaying in silence for a while. Peter breaks the silence a few minutes later when he whispers the one thing that\u2019s been eating at him since he woke on Titan to Mr. Stark missing and Dr. Strange yelling instructions.<br>\n\u201cI was dead.\u201d<br>\nSaying it out loud doesn\u2019t make Peter feel any better like he thought it would. There\u2019s no rushing epiphany that comes to him or even the denial from Mr. Stark that he\u2019d been secretly wishing for.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Is the only thing that Mr. Stark says after a long moment. He sounds confident though. Confident and sure in a way that Peter doesn\u2019t think he could ever be. He sounds every bit the hero that Peter\u2019s looked up almost his whole life. \u201cWe\u2019re both here now and that\u2019s all that matters. We\u2019ll figure out the semantics later.\u201d<br>\nPeter isn\u2019t sure, but he decides to trusts Mr. Stark anyway.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Saturday morning, Peter attends the Black Widow\u2019s funeral.<br>\nHe watches as Cap lowers down a decorated wreath into the lake. It\u2019s full of photos, parting gifts from her fans and her found family, her widow bites, and a bundle of fan mail from the countless of people she\u2019d saved throughout the years.<br>\nPeter never met her properly, Mr. Stark said that Germany didn\u2019t count, but he stands out on the dock of the lake house with the other Avengers and pays his respects. She made the ultimate sacrifice to give him the chance to be here, and he thanks her for it.<br>\n(Peter\u2019s spider drone sits by her widow bites. Mr. Stark had insisted.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good kid, Pete.\u201d Mr. Stark had sniffed when Peter had asked if they could include it. \u201cShe would have loved you.\u201d)<br>\nThe water accepts their tribute and the mourners slowly drift away.<br>\nA little while later, Mr. Stark finds him sitting alone at a picnic table picking at the wood.<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Pete?\u201d<br>\nPeter\u2019s stomach twists with guilt. It should be the other way around; him checking on Mr. Stark. They\u2019re at his friend\u2019s funeral. It\u2019s Mr. Stark, not Peter, who grimaces as he gently lowers himself onto the seat beside Peter because his burns still bother him some days.<br>\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Peter finally says after a moment. A piece of table gives underneath his finger nail. \u201cJust tired.\u201d<br>\nIt\u2019s not a complete lie. He is tired. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s had a full night\u2019s rest since he\u2019s been back. Mr. Stark invited him and May to stay with them during the summer and he\u2019s hoping it\u2019ll help.<br>\nThe thing is, adjusting to everything has been harder than what he thought it\u2019d be. It seems like the universe is still reeling. It\u2019s struggling to find a place for half the population that it\u2019d mourned and moved on from.<br>\nHalf of his classmates are in college. He\u2019s lucky that he still has Ned and MJ to navigate what\u2019s sure to be the weirdest senior year ever, but he can\u2019t help the twinge of bitterness that jumps in his throat when he scrolls through Instagram and sees the life he could have been living.<br>\nPeter knows that he should just be grateful that he\u2019s alive. He\u2019s owns everything to Mr. Stark and to the Avengers. He should be happy.<br>\nSo why does he feel so lost? Why can\u2019t he sleep? Why does he get so angry sometimes for no reason?<br>\nMr. Stark just narrows his eyes at him, no doubt easily seeing right through him, but thankfully says nothing. Instead, he wraps his good arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders and pulls him close. He presses their heads together and they just breath for a moment.<br>\n\u201cI love you, Pete.\u201d<br>\nSomehow, Peter\u2019s able push past the lump that\u2019s lodged itself in his throat to say:<br>\n\u201cI love you too, Mr. Stark.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Saturday afternoon, after Peter dies and then comes back to life, Mr. Stark tells Peter that he loves him for the first time and Peter lets himself believe that thing may turn out all right.</p>",

This is such a cool idea.</p>\n\n<p>Trope: \u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d<br>\n***<br>\nOn Wednesday afternoons, Peter works in the lab with Mr. Stark.<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t get much work done this afternoon though. He mostly spends his time dodging the hand that will occasionally dart out to tug on his curls.<br>\nMr. Stark claims that it\u2019s an experiment to test his spidey sense, but Peter knows that it\u2019s really because he\u2019s overdue for a haircut and the humidity outside has kinked it up into a curly fizzy mess, and Mr. Stark apparently has nothing better else to do then tease him.<br>\nWithin the past two years of knowing each other, Peter\u2019s spidey sense has long realized that Mr. Stark is no threat, so it says nothing when he\u2019s districted, too busy concentrating on the busted web shooter in front of him, to notice the man walking past. He gets no warning until Mr. Stark yanks on a curl and then gets snagged on it.<br>\n\u201cOw, Mr. Stark!\u201d Peter complains while Mr. Stark untangles his finger with a guilty smile. Peter shakes his head and runs his own fingers through the overgrown mop, checking for anymore knots. Judging by the look on Mr. Stark\u2019s face, he does nothing but make it more poofy. He sticks his tongue out at the older man.<br>\n\u201cSorry kid.\u201d Mr. Stark chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone and let you work.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave me alone.\u201d Peter tells him. \u201cJust my hair. Let it live in peace.\u201d<br>\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Mr. Stark says like it\u2019s the worst request in the world and he\u2019s put out by it. The smirk on his face though, while he sits by Peter and gets to work on his own project, betrays him.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Thursday morning, Peter follows a wizard into space.<br>\nMr. Stark is in his ear telling him to let go. That he\u2019ll catch him. Peter believes him but he can\u2019t let go. His fingers aren\u2019t working like they should.<br>\nHe\u2019s a little scared. (He\u2019d rather not go to space today, thank you. He has a chem test in the morning.)<br>\nHe\u2019s a little ashamed. (He can\u2019t stop thinking about how he failed the one job Mr. Stark gave him.)<br>\nHe\u2019s a lot lightheaded. (He can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t breathe. He can\u2019t breathe.)<br>\nMr. Stark is still in his ear. He sounds calm but Peter knows he\u2019s scared. Sometimes, when Mr. Stark\u2019s scared enough his voice goes all calm like that. Like he\u2019s trying to convince him that everything is under control.<br>\nPeter eventually let\u2019s go of the spaceship but it\u2019s only when his vision goes black. Mr. Stark catches him though, just like he promised, and Peter wakes up in a brand-new suit.<br>\nMr. Stark tries to send him home, but the thought of his mentor going alone to the one place he fears the most, makes Peter stick again to the side of the ship.<br>\nHe\u2019ll be in huge trouble. Mr. Stark may even hate him for purposely putting himself in danger like this, but at least he isn\u2019t heading towards his worst nightmare alone.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Thursday afternoon, Peter dies in Mr. Stark\u2019s arms.<br>\nPeter\u2019s thought about his own death before. It might be morbid, but death has been following him around since he was six and his parents got a plane and never came back home. And then when Uncle Ben never came home from that 7-11. It leans over his shoulder every time he flings himself off a skyscraper and faces criminals every night.<br>\nHe always imagined that he\u2019d be brave when it happened. He thought that\u2019d it be peaceful, a little like falling asleep.<br>\nThat\u2019s not what happens on Titan.<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t go quietly. He cries and sobs like a little kid. He doesn\u2019t mean to; he wants to be brave, but it\u2019s all happening so fast that he isn\u2019t even sure what\u2019s happening.<br>\nHe\u2019s hot all over and achy. Is he sick? Or is he turning to dust like the others?<br>\nPeter stumbles forward towards the only source of comfort he has on this stupid planet and Mr. Stark catches him. He holds him and buries his hand in the matted curls that he was teasing Peter about the other day. He doesn\u2019t let go even when they fall to the ground.<br>\nThis isn\u2019t how this was supposed to go.<br>\nPeter looks up at Mr. Stark and apologizes. He\u2019s not entirely sure what he\u2019s sorry for. For not listening and coming to space? For not getting the gauntlet off in time? For dying?<br>\nApologizing feels right though, like it\u2019s something he needs to say.<br>\nPeter just barely can say it before he drifts away.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Friday morning, Peter blinks awake.<br>\nHe thinks it\u2019s Friday, anyway. Or maybe it\u2019s still Thursday? He\u2019s not sure. All he knows is that his head is pounding, and he feels awful.<br>\nHe\u2019s still on Titan, but he can\u2019t find Mr. Stark. Dr. Strange is there though. He rushes Peter to his unsteady feet and is saying something about how it\u2019s been five years and they\u2019ve got to go help them now, right now.<br>\nPeter barely gets the chance to catch his breath, let alone process that info bomb, but apparently the fight isn\u2019t over so he tries to get his head on straight.<br>\nDr. Strange does his yellow sparkly magic and opens a portal to a battlefield. Peter spies a smoking \u2018A\u2019 and his heart sinks with the realization of where they are. It\u2019s the Avengers compound, but it looks like it\u2019s been bombed There\u2019s nothing let but scorched earth and twisted metal.<br>\nThere\u2019s an army waiting. But they have an army too and Peter doesn\u2019t hesitate to leap into action when Captain America orders them to assemble.<br>\nHe saves Mr. Stark from the huge alien\u2019s hammer for the second time in just as many days.<br>\nPeter\u2019s so happy to see him he can\u2019t help but ramble. Mostly because if anyone can explain what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s Mr. Stark. So, Peter rushes to tell him everything because he knows that Mr. Stark likes to have all the facts on these kinds of things. And, in the past, his little tirades were always broken up by the odd quip, teasing, or stray observation from Mr. Stark. But now the man stays quiet. Peter\u2019s honestly not even sure if he\u2019s listening. Mr. Stark is just staring at him really weirdly.<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that gray stuff in your hair?\u201d Peter asks suddenly, surprising himself. He hadn\u2019t meant to say that; he\u2019d just noticed it but now it\u2019s all he can see. He\u2019s pretty sure Mr. Stark\u2019s hair didn\u2019t look like that yesterday.<br>\nIt\u2019s been five years.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s just gray hair.\u201d Mr. Stark says, and he sounds weird too, like he\u2019s a little out of breath.<br>\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Peter says, feeling a little stupid, and a lot confused.<br>\nHe goes to finish his story but Mr. Stark tugs him into a hug before he can. It takes Peter by surprise. Mr. Stark isn\u2019t much of a hugger but you wouldn\u2019t know it based on how tightly he\u2019s holding Peter right now. Peter hugs back just as tightly.<br>\n\u201cThis is nice.\u201d He whispers. It\u2019s really the only nice thing that\u2019s happened to him since he jumped out of that bus.<br>\nMr. Stark breathes out a laugh. Then, to Peter\u2019s shock and delight, he presses a kiss to his cheek, firm and gentle. He squeezes Peter one last time before letting go.<br>\nPeter misses the contact as soon as he steps back but he understands. They have a fight to finish. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for that after they win.<br>\nHe catches Mr. Stark looking at him weird again, like Peter\u2019s done something amazing by just existing. He shakes his head a little when he realizes that he\u2019s been caught and sniffs.<br>\n\u201cAlright, Spider-Man.\u201d He says. \u201cLet\u2019s go save the universe.\u201d<br>\n***<br>\nPeter doesn\u2019t know what day it really is. He doesn\u2019t even know what year it is anymore.<br>\nNone of that matters now.<br>\n\u201cWe did it, Mr. Stark. We won.\u201d Mr. Stark just sits there, eyes empty and staring at nothing. \u201cYou did it, sir. You did it.\u201d<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t move, doesn\u2019t even twitch when Peter reaches out to him and that\u2019s how Peter knows it\u2019s bad. Mr. Stark is a lot of things but he\u2019s never still. He\u2019s always in motion, body and mind. This isn\u2019t the Tony Stark Peter knows, and it guts him.<br>\n\u201cPlease, Tony. No.\u201d Peter begs, the first sob escaping him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\nHe doesn\u2019t even try to hold back his tears when Pepper gently pulls him away and hands him over to Rhodey.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tony.\u201d He hears Pepper say, and he wants to scream. This isn\u2019t okay. None of this is okay. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can-\u201d<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence.\u201d Dr. Strange interrupts unexpectedly, stepping out of portal, Captain America right behind him.<br>\n\u201cWe have to hurry.\u201d He says as Captain America lifts Mr. Starks limp burnt body into his arms. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d<br>\n***<br>\nPeter still doesn\u2019t know what day or year it is.<br>\nAll he knows is that he\u2019s Wakanda. They could have a different calendar year for all he knows.<br>\nWhat he knows is that he\u2019s never traveling by portals again.<br>\nHe\u2019s only done it a couple times but so far, they\u2019ve only taken him to only bad things. Like getting beaten up by Thanos. Or the smoking husk of the compound. And now a Wakandan waiting room.<br>\nIn reality, the waiting room is the best place he could be because it means that Mr. Stark has a fighting chance. And he and everyone else in this room is beyond grateful for that chance because without it Mr. Stark would be dead.<br>\nThe bad part is the waiting. It\u2019s been three hours since they rushed Mr. Stark into surgery. Peter hit his adrenaline crash an hour ago. He feels like he\u2019s going out of his mind.<br>\nHis hands shake and he feels sick as he listens to Dr. Strange talk to the room, filling everyone in. He tells them how that everyone Thanos had dusted has been dead for five years. Captain America solemnly confirms it.<br>\nPeter wonders if Aunt May was one of them. He doesn\u2019t have his phone to even call and check on her.<br>\nHis nausea ramps up. He was dead for five years. Five years of his life, gone, just like that. With a snap of a finger. He can\u2019t wrap his mind around it. His head swims and he can\u2019t stop seeing Mr. Stark\u2019s empty eyes.<br>\nThe sound of chair legs screeching across the floor echoes loudly around the room and it takes Peter a moment to realize that he the cause of it. All eyes are on him. He stands, chest heaving but not taking in any air. Dr. Strange and Captain America turn to him like they\u2019re expecting him to say something.<br>\n\u201cI-\u201d Peter swallows thickly. His stomach churns and he feels like he\u2019s going to puke. \u201cI-I can\u2019t-I gotta-\u201d<br>\nHe runs from the room and stumbles out into the hallway. He makes it only a few feet before his knees give out. He throws a hand up onto the wall and his powers making his hand stick are the only thing that keeps him somewhat upright. His legs crumple underneath him but the hand that wraps around his elbow saves him from hitting the floor.<br>\nCaptain America eases him to the floor. He settles Peter against the wall and pushes a small trash can in between his legs. Peter wastes no time heaving into it.<br>\nNothing comes up though. There\u2019s nothing in his stomach, because until four hours ago, he was dead. His body doesn\u2019t seem to understand that because his stomach still cramps and twists and turns, trying to bring something up.<br>\n\u201cEasy, Queens.\u201d Cap soothes between gags and once again when Peter finally stops long enough to breathe again. He\u2019s afraid if he opens his mouth, he\u2019ll start up again so he just nods instead and leans his head back against the wall. He closes his eyes. The world spins around him and he floats away in the darkness.<br>\nHe\u2019s not sure how long he drifts for before a cold, dry hand presses up against his forehead. He flinches away, and the hand settles onto his shoulder instead.<br>\n\u201cIs he alright?\u201d A voice that\u2019s not Captain America asks above him and Peter cracks open an eye to see the Winter Soldier staring down at him.<br>\nHe\u2019s in sweatpants and a tee shirt. His long hair is pulled back into a wet bun. It\u2019s one of the most surreal things Peter has ever seen, and that\u2019s saying something. He decides that he\u2019s not in the right frame of mind to handle this and shuts his eyes again.<br>\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look too good.\u201d<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s delayed shock, I think.\u201d Cap answers. He pats Peter\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cWould you go ask T\u2019Challa if we can borrow a suite? He needs to lie down.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou can use mine.\u201d The Winter Soldier offers and Cap breathes a little sigh of relief.<br>\n\u201cThanks, Buck.\u201d Peter feels Cap shift and when he opens his eyes, he\u2019s kneeling in front of Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, Queens?\u201d<br>\n\u201cPeter.\u201d He mumbles, still feeling sick.<br>\n\u201cHi, Peter.\u201d Cap smiles at him. \u201cCan I help you up?\u201d<br>\nHe nods and then is quickly lifted onto his feet. The hallway spins dangerously around him and he tilts with it. Cap\u2019s grip on him tightens, and he shifts again, taking on most of Peter\u2019s weight.<br>\nCap leads him to what looks like an apartment. He settles Peter on the couch with strict instructions to get some rest while he gets him something to eat. He uses his PSA voice and everything.<br>\nJoke\u2019s on him, Peter thinks dizzily as he tips his head back onto the cushions. He\u2019s been immune to the \u201cCaptain America\u201d voice since fifth grade. He stays put but only because he seriously doubts that he could get up under his own power.<br>\nThe Winter Soldier walks is just as Cap is pressing a grilled cheese and apple juice into Peter\u2019s still shaking hands. Hawkeye, Thor, and weird looking Hulk invite themselves in not too long after. Soon tons of heroes, some Peter knows and some he\u2019s doesn\u2019t, filter in and out asking for updates on Mr. Stark.<br>\nA few people come up and speak to him but Peter doesn\u2019t reply with much over one- or two-word answers. He really doesn\u2019t feel like talking. He doesn\u2019t mean to be rude. He\u2019s just so tired.<br>\nCap comes over after a while and drapes a blanket over him as a pointed hint, but Peter doesn\u2019t sleep. He wants- no needs- to be awake and alert. He doesn\u2019t want to miss any updates on Mr. Stark.<br>\nHe thinks they\u2019ll never hear anything when Happy bursts into the room, like it\u2019s a drug bust or something. All eyes are on him now but Happy ignores them. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d He demands as if Peter\u2019s a hostage or something.<br>\nPeter goes to answer, but it suddenly stopped short of the sight of the little girl who\u2019s perched on Happy\u2019s hip.<br>\nPeter hasn\u2019t officially been told about Morgan Stark\u2019s existence. He doesn\u2019t think they kept it from him on purpose or that she\u2019s some kind of big red secret. He truly thinks it hadn\u2019t been a priority, considering the current circumstances and he thinks that everyone just kind of forgot to tell him.<br>\nHe only found out because he overheard the hushed conversations around him. Overheard the quiet concerned voices asking if she was all right, how she was coping. He saw the photo of a smiling, dark-haired little girl sandwiched between her mom and dad on Pepper\u2019s phone when she pulled him into a hug earlier right after they took Mr. Stark into surgery.<br>\nMorgan Stark is the ultimate proof that it really has been five years. Because Peter\u2019s pretty sure that he would have noticed if Mr. Stark had a daughter before. And there\u2019s no doubt that that little girl is Tony Stark and Pepper Potts\u2019s daughter. She looks just like Mr. Stark, down the same dark hair and sharp intelligent eyes.<br>\nThose eyes narrow in on Peter now and he has to suppress a shiver because he\u2019s seen that same intense CEO from Pepper before.<br>\nShe spots him before Happy does and wiggles out from his hold, running over to Peter. She launches herself up onto the couch beside him and looks him up and down, examining him. Peter tries hard not to squirm underneath her gaze. He must pass some kind of test though because suddenly smiles up at him.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite superhero!\u201d She exclaims, folding her tiny fingers into her equally tiny palm on hands pointing them at him. It takes her making tiny \u2018 thwip thwip \u2019 sounds for Peter to clue in that she\u2019s talking about him. She pokes at the spider emblem in the middle of his chest. \u201cSecond to Iron Man, of course.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d Peter agrees weakly. He\u2019s honestly not sure of what else to say. His brain is beyond fired at this point. The whole thing is overwhelming.<br>\nWhen Peter started the day: it was 2018. He was a junior and Mr. Stark didn\u2019t have kids, that he knew of. Now, somehow: It\u2019s 2023. Peter\u2019s been dead and Mr. Stark has a wife, kid, and a whole life that doesn\u2019t include Peter.<br>\nIt\u2019s all too much. His head hurts. His whole body aches. It feels like someone is squeezing his heart too tight.<br>\nHe feels like he\u2019s on the verge of a complete, utter breakdown.<br>\nMorgan doesn\u2019t notice, she\u2019s too busy babbling away to notice that he\u2019s having a crisis, but the adults don\u2019t miss it. Happy and Cap walk over and Cap hovers like a mother hen while Happy scoops Morgan back into his arms.<br>\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just bombard people like that, little miss.\u201d Happy lightly chastises. \u201cGive him some space.\u201d<br>\nMorgan pouts and it\u2019s easily the cutest thing Peter\u2019s ever seen.\u201cBut daddy said that he\u2019s my big brother. That means it\u2019s his job to listen to my stories.\u201d<br>\nSomething deep inside Peter snaps. But not in a breaking sort of way. No, it\u2019s more like something snaps into place. Like something clicks in Peter\u2019s scrambled brain.<br>\nThat\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s daughter.<br>\nAnd, yeah, okay, he already knew that, but in that moment it really hits home.<br>\nThat\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s daughter. His baby. And she knows Peter. She called him her big brother. Peter has been dead for five years, her entire life, but Mr. Stark told her about him. He included him.<br>\nThe wave of emotion that crashes over him steals his breath. It\u2019s love, but fierce and more protective that anything he\u2019s ever felt before. Peter knows, right then and there, that he\u2019d do anything for Morgan Stark.<br>\nPeter reaches back for her. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d He tells Happy. He sounds horrible, like his vocal cords have been through a wood chipper. Even Happy and Cap wince at it. He briefly remembers getting choked out by Thanos but quickly shakes the memory away.<br>\nHappy doesn\u2019t so much as hand Morgan over as she throws herself at Peter when she decides that Happy isn\u2019t moving quick enough. She wraps around Peter and buries her little face into his neck.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back to meet me.\u201d She whispers and Peter loses it.<br>\nTears fill up his eyes, hot and fast, and he doesn\u2019t even attempt to stop them. Wiping them away would mean letting go of Morgan and he refuses to do that. So, he just stares up at the ceiling and lets them silently fall. They steadily drip down his face and into Morgan\u2019s hair, until a calloused hand swipes some away. Peter blinks up at Happy as he steps into his line of vision.<br>\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s how I acted the first time I held her too.\u201d He says gruffly, like he\u2019s holding back tears of his own. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d<br>\n\u201cHey, Happy.\u201d Peter sniffles.<br>\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some good news.\u201d Happy says, ruffling Peter\u2019s matted hair before just resting his hand on top of it. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to May. She\u2019s on her way right now. She sends her love.\u201d<br>\nPeter nods, still sniffling. Just knowing that May is all right and that he\u2019ll see her soon takes a huge weight off of him.<br>\n\u201cAnd Boss is out of surgery. The doctors say that he\u2019s doing great. He\u2019s down an arm but other than that, he\u2019ll be back home in no time.\u201d<br>\nWith no warning, Peter busts into full-blown, relieved sobs. He guessed he didn\u2019t realize how worried he\u2019d been that Mr. Stark wouldn\u2019t pull through. His sobs are too loud in the now quiet room but Peter can\u2019t stop.<br>\nGod, he really is a mess.<br>\n\u201cDo you want to go see him?\u201d Happy asks over the sounds of Peter\u2019s meltdown and Peter nods so quickly that he almost gives himself whiplash. Happy goes to take Morgan but the little girl holds onto Peter tighter, so he just heaves the both of them up off the couch and follows Happy out.<br>\nShe doesn\u2019t let go until they get outside of Mr. Stark\u2019s room. Then she abandons him as soon as she sees Pepper, who\u2019s waiting for them along with Rhodey. Pepper holds her close for a moment then pulls Peter into their embrace. She kisses Morgan\u2019s forehead then presses one against Peter\u2019s temple.<br>\n\u201cDad will be fine.\u201d Pepper says, her eyes shining. The wording makes it seems like the message is for Morgan but Pepper makes eye contact with Peter too. \u201cHe\u2019s just really tired right now, so we have to be gentle and quiet. Ok?\u201d<br>\nMorgan nods solemnly then elbows Peter to do the same. He does and doesn\u2019t miss the smile that all three adults share. Rhodey opens the door and they all step in together, but Peter stops at the doorway, frozen.<br>\nHis breath catches in happiness? Relief? Peter\u2019s not sure. All he knows is this is a vast improvement over the last time he saw Mr. Stark. So much so that Peter wonders if that was even Mr. Stark out on that battlefield.<br>\nLife sparks in his eyes as he reaches out for his daughter. He looks so much better, it\u2019s amazing. The left side of his face is still eaten up with burns but they look several days old now instead of just hours. His left arm has been replaced with a sleek looking red and gold prosthetic.<br>\nPeter watches as Morgan crawls up the bed towards her dada until they\u2019re nose to nose. She smacks both her palms against his cheeks, as gently as a four-year-old can manage, Peter guesses, and frames his face. Mr. Stark beams at her.<br>\n\u201cHey, Morgana.\u201d He greets her causally, like he\u2019s just come back from buying groceries and not death\u2019s door. He uses his flesh hand to brush away some stray baby hair from her face. \u201cMiss me?\u201d<br>\n\u201cThree thousand.\u201d She answers and, Peter doesn\u2019t get it, but the adults absolute melt around him. They all give watery laughs. It must be an inside joke he\u2019s missed out on.<br>\nThe bitterness that come with the thought, is unexpected and chokes him. This is a happy moment, one he\u2019s been praying for since he got to Wakanda, and he doesn\u2019t want to ruin it with his bad attitude. He blinks back the tears that have cropped up again and tries to discreetly back out of the open door. But just as he thinks he\u2019s home free, Mr. Stark calls out to him.<br>\n\u201cPete?\u201d Even his voice sounds so much better. It\u2019s still weak, but it\u2019s no longer the dying rasp that had gasped out his wife\u2019s name.<br>\nSobs rip through Peter before he can stop them. He tries to smother them, covering his face with his hands, but he can\u2019t stop. His whole-body shakes with the effort. He\u2019s still self-aware enough to be embarrassed though. This is his second breakdown of the day. The literal child in the room is handing the situation better than he is.<br>\nHe just stands there crying like a baby until hands land on his shoulders and gently lead him away. He assumes that he\u2019s being taken out of the room until his knees knock against the metal frame of Mr. Stark\u2019s hospital bed. The hands that brought he here, give him an encouraging pat on the head and<br>\nPeter hears everyone file out of the room, leaving him and Mr. Stark alone.<br>\n\u201cPeter?\u201d He hears Mr. Stark say over his blubbering. \u201cThink you could move your hands for me, bud? I really want to see those big ole Bambi eyes of yours. Especially considering I figured out time travel to see them again.\u201d<br>\nHe knows that Mr. Stark is trying to lighten the mood, trying to get Peter to laugh instead of having continuous meltdowns, but Peter\u2019s brain gets tripped up on the fact that Mr. Stark just said that he figured out time travel for him and he keeps wailing instead.<br>\n\u201cOh, Pete.\u201d Mr. Stark blows out a breath. \u201cOk, alright. You\u2019re okay, bud. Come here.\u201d<br>\nHe tugs at Peter\u2019s shoulders until he gets the hint and climbs up onto the bed. Once he\u2019s up there, Peter wastes no time curling around his mentor. He clings to Mr. Stark just as tightly as Morgan had to him. Mr. Stark\u2019s arms circle around him, his flesh one curling in his hair and the metal one cold against the back of his neck.<br>\n\u201cI thought I lost you.\u201d Peter hiccups and Mr. Stark\u2019s chest hitches underneath him. He rocks them back and forth.<br>\n\u201cI know, bud. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Mr. Stark soothes. \u201cI\u2019m here now though. We\u2019re okay. Everything is okay.\u201d<br>\nThey sit huddled together, swaying in silence for a while. Peter breaks the silence a few minutes later when he whispers the one thing that\u2019s been eating at him since he woke on Titan to Mr. Stark missing and Dr. Strange yelling instructions.<br>\n\u201cI was dead.\u201d<br>\nSaying it out loud doesn\u2019t make Peter feel any better like he thought it would. There\u2019s no rushing epiphany that comes to him or even the denial from Mr. Stark that he\u2019d been secretly wishing for.<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Is the only thing that Mr. Stark says after a long moment. He sounds confident though. Confident and sure in a way that Peter doesn\u2019t think he could ever be. He sounds every bit the hero that Peter\u2019s looked up almost his whole life. \u201cWe\u2019re both here now and that\u2019s all that matters. We\u2019ll figure out the semantics later.\u201d<br>\nPeter isn\u2019t sure, but he decides to trusts Mr. Stark anyway.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Saturday morning, Peter attends the Black Widow\u2019s funeral.<br>\nHe watches as Cap lowers down a decorated wreath into the lake. It\u2019s full of photos, parting gifts from her fans and her found family, her widow bites, and a bundle of fan mail from the countless of people she\u2019d saved throughout the years.<br>\nPeter never met her properly, Mr. Stark said that Germany didn\u2019t count, but he stands out on the dock of the lake house with the other Avengers and pays his respects. She made the ultimate sacrifice to give him the chance to be here, and he thanks her for it.<br>\n(Peter\u2019s spider drone sits by her widow bites. Mr. Stark had insisted.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good kid, Pete.\u201d Mr. Stark had sniffed when Peter had asked if they could include it. \u201cShe would have loved you.\u201d)<br>\nThe water accepts their tribute and the mourners slowly drift away.<br>\nA little while later, Mr. Stark finds him sitting alone at a picnic table picking at the wood.<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Pete?\u201d<br>\nPeter\u2019s stomach twists with guilt. It should be the other way around; him checking on Mr. Stark. They\u2019re at his friend\u2019s funeral. It\u2019s Mr. Stark, not Peter, who grimaces as he gently lowers himself onto the seat beside Peter because his burns still bother him some days.<br>\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Peter finally says after a moment. A piece of table gives underneath his finger nail. \u201cJust tired.\u201d<br>\nIt\u2019s not a complete lie. He is tired. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s had a full night\u2019s rest since he\u2019s been back. Mr. Stark invited him and May to stay with them during the summer and he\u2019s hoping it\u2019ll help.<br>\nThe thing is, adjusting to everything has been harder than what he thought it\u2019d be. It seems like the universe is still reeling. It\u2019s struggling to find a place for half the population that it\u2019d mourned and moved on from.<br>\nHalf of his classmates are in college. He\u2019s lucky that he still has Ned and MJ to navigate what\u2019s sure to be the weirdest senior year ever, but he can\u2019t help the twinge of bitterness that jumps in his throat when he scrolls through Instagram and sees the life he could have been living.<br>\nPeter knows that he should just be grateful that he\u2019s alive. He\u2019s owns everything to Mr. Stark and to the Avengers. He should be happy.<br>\nSo why does he feel so lost? Why can\u2019t he sleep? Why does he get so angry sometimes for no reason?<br>\nMr. Stark just narrows his eyes at him, no doubt easily seeing right through him, but thankfully says nothing. Instead, he wraps his good arm around Peter\u2019s shoulders and pulls him close. He presses their heads together and they just breath for a moment.<br>\n\u201cI love you, Pete.\u201d<br>\nSomehow, Peter\u2019s able push past the lump that\u2019s lodged itself in his throat to say:<br>\n\u201cI love you too, Mr. Stark.<br>\n***<br>\nOn a Saturday afternoon, after Peter dies and then comes back to life, Mr. Stark tells Peter that he loves him for the first time and Peter lets himself believe that thing may turn out all right.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Thanks to @irondadbingo for all their hard work! This is such a cool idea.</p>\n\n<p>Trope: &ldquo;I thought I lost you.&rdquo;<br />\n***<br />\nOn Wednesday afternoons, Peter works in the lab with Mr. Stark.<br />\nHe doesn&rsquo;t get much work done this afternoon though. He mostly spends his time dodging the hand that will occasionally dart out to tug on his curls.<br />\nMr. Stark claims that it&rsquo;s an experiment to test his spidey sense, but Peter knows that it&rsquo;s really because he&rsquo;s overdue for a haircut and the humidity outside has kinked it up into a curly fizzy mess, and Mr. Stark apparently has nothing better else to do then tease him.<br />\nWithin the past two years of knowing each other, Peter&rsquo;s spidey sense has long realized that Mr. Stark is no threat, so it says nothing when he&rsquo;s districted, too busy concentrating on the busted web shooter in front of him, to notice the man walking past. He gets no warning until Mr. Stark yanks on a curl and then gets snagged on it.<br />\n&ldquo;Ow, Mr. Stark!&rdquo; Peter complains while Mr. Stark untangles his finger with a guilty smile. Peter shakes his head and runs his own fingers through the overgrown mop, checking for anymore knots. Judging by the look on Mr. Stark&rsquo;s face, he does nothing but make it more poofy. He sticks his tongue out at the older man.<br />\n&ldquo;Sorry kid.&rdquo; Mr. Stark chuckles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you alone and let you work.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to leave me alone.&rdquo; Peter tells him. &ldquo;Just my hair. Let it live in peace.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Fine, fine.&rdquo; Mr. Stark says like it&rsquo;s the worst request in the world and he&rsquo;s put out by it. The smirk on his face though, while he sits by Peter and gets to work on his own project, betrays him.<br />\n***<br />\nOn a Thursday morning, Peter follows a wizard into space.<br />\nMr. Stark is in his ear telling him to let go. That he&rsquo;ll catch him. Peter believes him but he can&rsquo;t let go. His fingers aren&rsquo;t working like they should.<br />\nHe&rsquo;s a little scared. (He&rsquo;d rather not go to space today, thank you. He has a chem test in the morning.)<br />\nHe&rsquo;s a little ashamed. (He can&rsquo;t stop thinking about how he failed the one job Mr. Stark gave him.)<br />\nHe&rsquo;s a lot lightheaded. (He can&rsquo;t breathe. He can&rsquo;t breathe. He can&rsquo;t breathe.)<br />\nMr. Stark is still in his ear. He sounds calm but Peter knows he&rsquo;s scared. Sometimes, when Mr. Stark&rsquo;s scared enough his voice goes all calm like that. Like he&rsquo;s trying to convince him that everything is under control.<br />\nPeter eventually let&rsquo;s go of the spaceship but it&rsquo;s only when his vision goes black. Mr. Stark catches him though, just like he promised, and Peter wakes up in a brand-new suit.<br />\nMr. Stark tries to send him home, but the thought of his mentor going alone to the one place he fears the most, makes Peter stick again to the side of the ship.<br />\nHe&rsquo;ll be in huge trouble. Mr. Stark may even hate him for purposely putting himself in danger like this, but at least he isn&rsquo;t heading towards his worst nightmare alone.<br />\n***<br />\nOn a Thursday afternoon, Peter dies in Mr. Stark&rsquo;s arms.<br />\nPeter&rsquo;s thought about his own death before. It might be morbid, but death has been following him around since he was six and his parents got a plane and never came back home. And then when Uncle Ben never came home from that 7-11. It leans over his shoulder every time he flings himself off a skyscraper and faces criminals every night.<br />\nHe always imagined that he&rsquo;d be brave when it happened. He thought that&rsquo;d it be peaceful, a little like falling asleep.<br />\nThat&rsquo;s not what happens on Titan.<br />\nHe doesn&rsquo;t go quietly. He cries and sobs like a little kid. He doesn&rsquo;t mean to; he wants to be brave, but it&rsquo;s all happening so fast that he isn&rsquo;t even sure what&rsquo;s happening.<br />\nHe&rsquo;s hot all over and achy. Is he sick? Or is he turning to dust like the others?<br />\nPeter stumbles forward towards the only source of comfort he has on this stupid planet and Mr. Stark catches him. He holds him and buries his hand in the matted curls that he was teasing Peter about the other day. He doesn&rsquo;t let go even when they fall to the ground.<br />\nThis isn&rsquo;t how this was supposed to go.<br />\nPeter looks up at Mr. Stark and apologizes. He&rsquo;s not entirely sure what he&rsquo;s sorry for. For not listening and coming to space? For not getting the gauntlet off in time? For dying?<br />\nApologizing feels right though, like it&rsquo;s something he needs to say.<br />\nPeter just barely can say it before he drifts away.<br />\n***<br />\nOn a Friday morning, Peter blinks awake.<br />\nHe thinks it&rsquo;s Friday, anyway. Or maybe it&rsquo;s still Thursday? He&rsquo;s not sure. All he knows is that his head is pounding, and he feels awful.<br />\nHe&rsquo;s still on Titan, but he can&rsquo;t find Mr. Stark. Dr. Strange is there though. He rushes Peter to his unsteady feet and is saying something about how it&rsquo;s been five years and they&rsquo;ve got to go help them now, right now.<br />\nPeter barely gets the chance to catch his breath, let alone process that info bomb, but apparently the fight isn&rsquo;t over so he tries to get his head on straight.<br />\nDr. Strange does his yellow sparkly magic and opens a portal to a battlefield. Peter spies a smoking &lsquo;A&rsquo; and his heart sinks with the realization of where they are. It&rsquo;s the Avengers compound, but it looks like it&rsquo;s been bombed There&rsquo;s nothing let but scorched earth and twisted metal.<br />\nThere&rsquo;s an army waiting. But they have an army too and Peter doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to leap into action when Captain America orders them to assemble.<br />\nHe saves Mr. Stark from the huge alien&rsquo;s hammer for the second time in just as many days.<br />\nPeter&rsquo;s so happy to see him he can&rsquo;t help but ramble. Mostly because if anyone can explain what&rsquo;s going on, it&rsquo;s Mr. Stark. So, Peter rushes to tell him everything because he knows that Mr. Stark likes to have all the facts on these kinds of things. And, in the past, his little tirades were always broken up by the odd quip, teasing, or stray observation from Mr. Stark. But now the man stays quiet. Peter&rsquo;s honestly not even sure if he&rsquo;s listening. Mr. Stark is just staring at him really weirdly.<br />\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that gray stuff in your hair?&rdquo; Peter asks suddenly, surprising himself. He hadn&rsquo;t meant to say that; he&rsquo;d just noticed it but now it&rsquo;s all he can see. He&rsquo;s pretty sure Mr. Stark&rsquo;s hair didn&rsquo;t look like that yesterday.<br />\nIt&rsquo;s been five years.<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just gray hair.&rdquo; Mr. Stark says, and he sounds weird too, like he&rsquo;s a little out of breath.<br />\n&ldquo;Oh, sorry.&rdquo; Peter says, feeling a little stupid, and a lot confused.<br />\nHe goes to finish his story but Mr. Stark tugs him into a hug before he can. It takes Peter by surprise. Mr. Stark isn&rsquo;t much of a hugger but you wouldn&rsquo;t know it based on how tightly he&rsquo;s holding Peter right now. Peter hugs back just as tightly.<br />\n&ldquo;This is nice.&rdquo; He whispers. It&rsquo;s really the only nice thing that&rsquo;s happened to him since he jumped out of that bus.<br />\nMr. Stark breathes out a laugh. Then, to Peter&rsquo;s shock and delight, he presses a kiss to his cheek, firm and gentle. He squeezes Peter one last time before letting go.<br />\nPeter misses the contact as soon as he steps back but he understands. They have a fight to finish. There&rsquo;ll be plenty of time for that after they win.<br />\nHe catches Mr. Stark looking at him weird again, like Peter&rsquo;s done something amazing by just existing. He shakes his head a little when he realizes that he&rsquo;s been caught and sniffs.<br />\n&ldquo;Alright, Spider-Man.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go save the universe.&rdquo;<br />\n***<br />\nPeter doesn&rsquo;t know what day it really is. He doesn&rsquo;t even know what year it is anymore.<br />\nNone of that matters now.<br />\n&ldquo;We did it, Mr. Stark. We won.&rdquo; Mr. Stark just sits there, eyes empty and staring at nothing. &ldquo;You did it, sir. You did it.&rdquo;<br />\nHe doesn&rsquo;t move, doesn&rsquo;t even twitch when Peter reaches out to him and that&rsquo;s how Peter knows it&rsquo;s bad. Mr. Stark is a lot of things but he&rsquo;s never still. He&rsquo;s always in motion, body and mind. This isn&rsquo;t the Tony Stark Peter knows, and it guts him.<br />\n&ldquo;Please, Tony. No.&rdquo; Peter begs, the first sob escaping him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;<br />\nHe doesn&rsquo;t even try to hold back his tears when Pepper gently pulls him away and hands him over to Rhodey.<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Tony.&rdquo; He hears Pepper say, and he wants to scream. This isn&rsquo;t okay. None of this is okay. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, you can-&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t finish that sentence.&rdquo; Dr. Strange interrupts unexpectedly, stepping out of portal, Captain America right behind him.<br />\n&ldquo;We have to hurry.&rdquo; He says as Captain America lifts Mr. Starks limp burnt body into his arms. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much time.&rdquo;<br />\n***<br />\nPeter still doesn&rsquo;t know what day or year it is.<br />\nAll he knows is that he&rsquo;s Wakanda. They could have a different calendar year for all he knows.<br />\nWhat he knows is that he&rsquo;s never traveling by portals again.<br />\nHe&rsquo;s only done it a couple times but so far, they&rsquo;ve only taken him to only bad things. Like getting beaten up by Thanos. Or the smoking husk of the compound. And now a Wakandan waiting room.<br />\nIn reality, the waiting room is the best place he could be because it means that Mr. Stark has a fighting chance. And he and everyone else in this room is beyond grateful for that chance because without it Mr. Stark would be dead.<br />\nThe bad part is the waiting. It&rsquo;s been three hours since they rushed Mr. Stark into surgery. Peter hit his adrenaline crash an hour ago. He feels like he&rsquo;s going out of his mind.<br />\nHis hands shake and he feels sick as he listens to Dr. Strange talk to the room, filling everyone in. He tells them how that everyone Thanos had dusted has been dead for five years. Captain America solemnly confirms it.<br />\nPeter wonders if Aunt May was one of them. He doesn&rsquo;t have his phone to even call and check on her.<br />\nHis nausea ramps up. He was dead for five years. Five years of his life, gone, just like that. With a snap of a finger. He can&rsquo;t wrap his mind around it. His head swims and he can&rsquo;t stop seeing Mr. Stark&rsquo;s empty eyes.<br />\nThe sound of chair legs screeching across the floor echoes loudly around the room and it takes Peter a moment to realize that he the cause of it. All eyes are on him. He stands, chest heaving but not taking in any air. Dr. Strange and Captain America turn to him like they&rsquo;re expecting him to say something.<br />\n&ldquo;I-&rdquo; Peter swallows thickly. His stomach churns and he feels like he&rsquo;s going to puke. &ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t-I gotta-&rdquo;<br />\nHe runs from the room and stumbles out into the hallway. He makes it only a few feet before his knees give out. He throws a hand up onto the wall and his powers making his hand stick are the only thing that keeps him somewhat upright. His legs crumple underneath him but the hand that wraps around his elbow saves him from hitting the floor.<br />\nCaptain America eases him to the floor. He settles Peter against the wall and pushes a small trash can in between his legs. Peter wastes no time heaving into it.<br />\nNothing comes up though. There&rsquo;s nothing in his stomach, because until four hours ago, he was dead. His body doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that because his stomach still cramps and twists and turns, trying to bring something up.<br />\n&ldquo;Easy, Queens.&rdquo; Cap soothes between gags and once again when Peter finally stops long enough to breathe again. He&rsquo;s afraid if he opens his mouth, he&rsquo;ll start up again so he just nods instead and leans his head back against the wall. He closes his eyes. The world spins around him and he floats away in the darkness.<br />\nHe&rsquo;s not sure how long he drifts for before a cold, dry hand presses up against his forehead. He flinches away, and the hand settles onto his shoulder instead.<br />\n&ldquo;Is he alright?&rdquo; A voice that&rsquo;s not Captain America asks above him and Peter cracks open an eye to see the Winter Soldier staring down at him.<br />\nHe&rsquo;s in sweatpants and a tee shirt. His long hair is pulled back into a wet bun. It&rsquo;s one of the most surreal things Peter has ever seen, and that&rsquo;s saying something. He decides that he&rsquo;s not in the right frame of mind to handle this and shuts his eyes again.<br />\n&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look too good.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delayed shock, I think.&rdquo; Cap answers. He pats Peter&rsquo;s shoulder again. &ldquo;Would you go ask T&rsquo;Challa if we can borrow a suite? He needs to lie down.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;You can use mine.&rdquo; The Winter Soldier offers and Cap breathes a little sigh of relief.<br />\n&ldquo;Thanks, Buck.&rdquo; Peter feels Cap shift and when he opens his eyes, he&rsquo;s kneeling in front of Peter. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, Queens?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; He mumbles, still feeling sick.<br />\n&ldquo;Hi, Peter.&rdquo; Cap smiles at him. &ldquo;Can I help you up?&rdquo;<br />\nHe nods and then is quickly lifted onto his feet. The hallway spins dangerously around him and he tilts with it. Cap&rsquo;s grip on him tightens, and he shifts again, taking on most of Peter&rsquo;s weight.<br />\nCap leads him to what looks like an apartment. He settles Peter on the couch with strict instructions to get some rest while he gets him something to eat. He uses his PSA voice and everything.<br />\nJoke&rsquo;s on him, Peter thinks dizzily as he tips his head back onto the cushions. He&rsquo;s been immune to the &ldquo;Captain America&rdquo; voice since fifth grade. He stays put but only because he seriously doubts that he could get up under his own power.<br />\nThe Winter Soldier walks is just as Cap is pressing a grilled cheese and apple juice into Peter&rsquo;s still shaking hands. Hawkeye, Thor, and weird looking Hulk invite themselves in not too long after. Soon tons of heroes, some Peter knows and some he&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t, filter in and out asking for updates on Mr. Stark.<br />\nA few people come up and speak to him but Peter doesn&rsquo;t reply with much over one- or two-word answers. He really doesn&rsquo;t feel like talking. He doesn&rsquo;t mean to be rude. He&rsquo;s just so tired.<br />\nCap comes over after a while and drapes a blanket over him as a pointed hint, but Peter doesn&rsquo;t sleep. He wants- no needs- to be awake and alert. He doesn&rsquo;t want to miss any updates on Mr. Stark.<br />\nHe thinks they&rsquo;ll never hear anything when Happy bursts into the room, like it&rsquo;s a drug bust or something. All eyes are on him now but Happy ignores them. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the kid?&rdquo; He demands as if Peter&rsquo;s a hostage or something.<br />\nPeter goes to answer, but it suddenly stopped short of the sight of the little girl who&rsquo;s perched on Happy&rsquo;s hip.<br />\nPeter hasn&rsquo;t officially been told about Morgan Stark&rsquo;s existence. He doesn&rsquo;t think they kept it from him on purpose or that she&rsquo;s some kind of big red secret. He truly thinks it hadn&rsquo;t been a priority, considering the current circumstances and he thinks that everyone just kind of forgot to tell him.<br />\nHe only found out because he overheard the hushed conversations around him. Overheard the quiet concerned voices asking if she was all right, how she was coping. He saw the photo of a smiling, dark-haired little girl sandwiched between her mom and dad on Pepper&rsquo;s phone when she pulled him into a hug earlier right after they took Mr. Stark into surgery.<br />\nMorgan Stark is the ultimate proof that it really has been five years. Because Peter&rsquo;s pretty sure that he would have noticed if Mr. Stark had a daughter before. And there&rsquo;s no doubt that that little girl is Tony Stark and Pepper Potts&rsquo;s daughter. She looks just like Mr. Stark, down the same dark hair and sharp intelligent eyes.<br />\nThose eyes narrow in on Peter now and he has to suppress a shiver because he&rsquo;s seen that same intense CEO from Pepper before.<br />\nShe spots him before Happy does and wiggles out from his hold, running over to Peter. She launches herself up onto the couch beside him and looks him up and down, examining him. Peter tries hard not to squirm underneath her gaze. He must pass some kind of test though because suddenly smiles up at him.<br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my favorite superhero!&rdquo; She exclaims, folding her tiny fingers into her equally tiny palm on hands pointing them at him. It takes her making tiny &lsquo; thwip thwip &rsquo; sounds for Peter to clue in that she&rsquo;s talking about him. She pokes at the spider emblem in the middle of his chest. &ldquo;Second to Iron Man, of course.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Yeah, of course.&rdquo; Peter agrees weakly. He&rsquo;s honestly not sure of what else to say. His brain is beyond fired at this point. The whole thing is overwhelming.<br />\nWhen Peter started the day: it was 2018. He was a junior and Mr. Stark didn&rsquo;t have kids, that he knew of. Now, somehow: It&rsquo;s 2023. Peter&rsquo;s been dead and Mr. Stark has a wife, kid, and a whole life that doesn&rsquo;t include Peter.<br />\nIt&rsquo;s all too much. His head hurts. His whole body aches. It feels like someone is squeezing his heart too tight.<br />\nHe feels like he&rsquo;s on the verge of a complete, utter breakdown.<br />\nMorgan doesn&rsquo;t notice, she&rsquo;s too busy babbling away to notice that he&rsquo;s having a crisis, but the adults don&rsquo;t miss it. Happy and Cap walk over and Cap hovers like a mother hen while Happy scoops Morgan back into his arms.<br />\n&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just bombard people like that, little miss.&rdquo; Happy lightly chastises. &ldquo;Give him some space.&rdquo;<br />\nMorgan pouts and it&rsquo;s easily the cutest thing Peter&rsquo;s ever seen.&ldquo;But daddy said that he&rsquo;s my big brother. That means it&rsquo;s his job to listen to my stories.&rdquo;<br />\nSomething deep inside Peter snaps. But not in a breaking sort of way. No, it&rsquo;s more like something snaps into place. Like something clicks in Peter&rsquo;s scrambled brain.<br />\nThat&rsquo;s Mr. Stark&rsquo;s daughter.<br />\nAnd, yeah, okay, he already knew that, but in that moment it really hits home.<br />\nThat&rsquo;s Mr. Stark&rsquo;s daughter. His baby. And she knows Peter. She called him her big brother. Peter has been dead for five years, her entire life, but Mr. Stark told her about him. He included him.<br />\nThe wave of emotion that crashes over him steals his breath. It&rsquo;s love, but fierce and more protective that anything he&rsquo;s ever felt before. Peter knows, right then and there, that he&rsquo;d do anything for Morgan Stark.<br />\nPeter reaches back for her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; He tells Happy. He sounds horrible, like his vocal cords have been through a wood chipper. Even Happy and Cap wince at it. He briefly remembers getting choked out by Thanos but quickly shakes the memory away.<br />\nHappy doesn&rsquo;t so much as hand Morgan over as she throws herself at Peter when she decides that Happy isn&rsquo;t moving quick enough. She wraps around Peter and buries her little face into his neck.<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came back to meet me.&rdquo; She whispers and Peter loses it.<br />\nTears fill up his eyes, hot and fast, and he doesn&rsquo;t even attempt to stop them. Wiping them away would mean letting go of Morgan and he refuses to do that. So, he just stares up at the ceiling and lets them silently fall. They steadily drip down his face and into Morgan&rsquo;s hair, until a calloused hand swipes some away. Peter blinks up at Happy as he steps into his line of vision.<br />\n&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s how I acted the first time I held her too.&rdquo; He says gruffly, like he&rsquo;s holding back tears of his own. &ldquo;Hey, kid.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Hey, Happy.&rdquo; Peter sniffles.<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some good news.&rdquo; Happy says, ruffling Peter&rsquo;s matted hair before just resting his hand on top of it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to May. She&rsquo;s on her way right now. She sends her love.&rdquo;<br />\nPeter nods, still sniffling. Just knowing that May is all right and that he&rsquo;ll see her soon takes a huge weight off of him.<br />\n&ldquo;And Boss is out of surgery. The doctors say that he&rsquo;s doing great. He&rsquo;s down an arm but other than that, he&rsquo;ll be back home in no time.&rdquo;<br />\nWith no warning, Peter busts into full-blown, relieved sobs. He guessed he didn&rsquo;t realize how worried he&rsquo;d been that Mr. Stark wouldn&rsquo;t pull through. His sobs are too loud in the now quiet room but Peter can&rsquo;t stop.<br />\nGod, he really is a mess.<br />\n&ldquo;Do you want to go see him?&rdquo; Happy asks over the sounds of Peter&rsquo;s meltdown and Peter nods so quickly that he almost gives himself whiplash. Happy goes to take Morgan but the little girl holds onto Peter tighter, so he just heaves the both of them up off the couch and follows Happy out.<br />\nShe doesn&rsquo;t let go until they get outside of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s room. Then she abandons him as soon as she sees Pepper, who&rsquo;s waiting for them along with Rhodey. Pepper holds her close for a moment then pulls Peter into their embrace. She kisses Morgan&rsquo;s forehead then presses one against Peter&rsquo;s temple.<br />\n&ldquo;Dad will be fine.&rdquo; Pepper says, her eyes shining. The wording makes it seems like the message is for Morgan but Pepper makes eye contact with Peter too. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just really tired right now, so we have to be gentle and quiet. Ok?&rdquo;<br />\nMorgan nods solemnly then elbows Peter to do the same. He does and doesn&rsquo;t miss the smile that all three adults share. Rhodey opens the door and they all step in together, but Peter stops at the doorway, frozen.<br />\nHis breath catches in happiness? Relief? Peter&rsquo;s not sure. All he knows is this is a vast improvement over the last time he saw Mr. Stark. So much so that Peter wonders if that was even Mr. Stark out on that battlefield.<br />\nLife sparks in his eyes as he reaches out for his daughter. He looks so much better, it&rsquo;s amazing. The left side of his face is still eaten up with burns but they look several days old now instead of just hours. His left arm has been replaced with a sleek looking red and gold prosthetic.<br />\nPeter watches as Morgan crawls up the bed towards her dada until they&rsquo;re nose to nose. She smacks both her palms against his cheeks, as gently as a four-year-old can manage, Peter guesses, and frames his face. Mr. Stark beams at her.<br />\n&ldquo;Hey, Morgana.&rdquo; He greets her causally, like he&rsquo;s just come back from buying groceries and not death&rsquo;s door. He uses his flesh hand to brush away some stray baby hair from her face. &ldquo;Miss me?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Three thousand.&rdquo; She answers and, Peter doesn&rsquo;t get it, but the adults absolute melt around him. They all give watery laughs. It must be an inside joke he&rsquo;s missed out on.<br />\nThe bitterness that come with the thought, is unexpected and chokes him. This is a happy moment, one he&rsquo;s been praying for since he got to Wakanda, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to ruin it with his bad attitude. He blinks back the tears that have cropped up again and tries to discreetly back out of the open door. But just as he thinks he&rsquo;s home free, Mr. Stark calls out to him.<br />\n&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; Even his voice sounds so much better. It&rsquo;s still weak, but it&rsquo;s no longer the dying rasp that had gasped out his wife&rsquo;s name.<br />\nSobs rip through Peter before he can stop them. He tries to smother them, covering his face with his hands, but he can&rsquo;t stop. His whole-body shakes with the effort. He&rsquo;s still self-aware enough to be embarrassed though. This is his second breakdown of the day. The literal child in the room is handing the situation better than he is.<br />\nHe just stands there crying like a baby until hands land on his shoulders and gently lead him away. He assumes that he&rsquo;s being taken out of the room until his knees knock against the metal frame of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s hospital bed. The hands that brought he here, give him an encouraging pat on the head and<br />\nPeter hears everyone file out of the room, leaving him and Mr. Stark alone.<br />\n&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; He hears Mr. Stark say over his blubbering. &ldquo;Think you could move your hands for me, bud? I really want to see those big ole Bambi eyes of yours. Especially considering I figured out time travel to see them again.&rdquo;<br />\nHe knows that Mr. Stark is trying to lighten the mood, trying to get Peter to laugh instead of having continuous meltdowns, but Peter&rsquo;s brain gets tripped up on the fact that Mr. Stark just said that he figured out time travel for him and he keeps wailing instead.<br />\n&ldquo;Oh, Pete.&rdquo; Mr. Stark blows out a breath. &ldquo;Ok, alright. You&rsquo;re okay, bud. Come here.&rdquo;<br />\nHe tugs at Peter&rsquo;s shoulders until he gets the hint and climbs up onto the bed. Once he&rsquo;s up there, Peter wastes no time curling around his mentor. He clings to Mr. Stark just as tightly as Morgan had to him. Mr. Stark&rsquo;s arms circle around him, his flesh one curling in his hair and the metal one cold against the back of his neck.<br />\n&ldquo;I thought I lost you.&rdquo; Peter hiccups and Mr. Stark&rsquo;s chest hitches underneath him. He rocks them back and forth.<br />\n&ldquo;I know, bud. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Mr. Stark soothes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now though. We&rsquo;re okay. Everything is okay.&rdquo;<br />\nThey sit huddled together, swaying in silence for a while. Peter breaks the silence a few minutes later when he whispers the one thing that&rsquo;s been eating at him since he woke on Titan to Mr. Stark missing and Dr. Strange yelling instructions.<br />\n&ldquo;I was dead.&rdquo;<br />\nSaying it out loud doesn&rsquo;t make Peter feel any better like he thought it would. There&rsquo;s no rushing epiphany that comes to him or even the denial from Mr. Stark that he&rsquo;d been secretly wishing for.<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; Is the only thing that Mr. Stark says after a long moment. He sounds confident though. Confident and sure in a way that Peter doesn&rsquo;t think he could ever be. He sounds every bit the hero that Peter&rsquo;s looked up almost his whole life. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both here now and that&rsquo;s all that matters. We&rsquo;ll figure out the semantics later.&rdquo;<br />\nPeter isn&rsquo;t sure, but he decides to trusts Mr. Stark anyway.<br />\n***<br />\nOn a Saturday morning, Peter attends the Black Widow&rsquo;s funeral.<br />\nHe watches as Cap lowers down a decorated wreath into the lake. It&rsquo;s full of photos, parting gifts from her fans and her found family, her widow bites, and a bundle of fan mail from the countless of people she&rsquo;d saved throughout the years.<br />\nPeter never met her properly, Mr. Stark said that Germany didn&rsquo;t count, but he stands out on the dock of the lake house with the other Avengers and pays his respects. She made the ultimate sacrifice to give him the chance to be here, and he thanks her for it.<br />\n(Peter&rsquo;s spider drone sits by her widow bites. Mr. Stark had insisted.<br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good kid, Pete.&rdquo; Mr. Stark had sniffed when Peter had asked if they could include it. &ldquo;She would have loved you.&rdquo;)<br />\nThe water accepts their tribute and the mourners slowly drift away.<br />\nA little while later, Mr. Stark finds him sitting alone at a picnic table picking at the wood.<br />\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Pete?&rdquo;<br />\nPeter&rsquo;s stomach twists with guilt. It should be the other way around; him checking on Mr. Stark. They&rsquo;re at his friend&rsquo;s funeral. It&rsquo;s Mr. Stark, not Peter, who grimaces as he gently lowers himself onto the seat beside Peter because his burns still bother him some days.<br />\n&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Peter finally says after a moment. A piece of table gives underneath his finger nail. &ldquo;Just tired.&rdquo;<br />\nIt&rsquo;s not a complete lie. He is tired. He doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s had a full night&rsquo;s rest since he&rsquo;s been back. Mr. Stark invited him and May to stay with them during the summer and he&rsquo;s hoping it&rsquo;ll help.<br />\nThe thing is, adjusting to everything has been harder than what he thought it&rsquo;d be. It seems like the universe is still reeling. It&rsquo;s struggling to find a place for half the population that it&rsquo;d mourned and moved on from.<br />\nHalf of his classmates are in college. He&rsquo;s lucky that he still has Ned and MJ to navigate what&rsquo;s sure to be the weirdest senior year ever, but he can&rsquo;t help the twinge of bitterness that jumps in his throat when he scrolls through Instagram and sees the life he could have been living.<br />\nPeter knows that he should just be grateful that he&rsquo;s alive. He&rsquo;s owns everything to Mr. Stark and to the Avengers. He should be happy.<br />\nSo why does he feel so lost? Why can&rsquo;t he sleep? Why does he get so angry sometimes for no reason?<br />\nMr. Stark just narrows his eyes at him, no doubt easily seeing right through him, but thankfully says nothing. Instead, he wraps his good arm around Peter&rsquo;s shoulders and pulls him close. He presses their heads together and they just breath for a moment.<br />\n&ldquo;I love you, Pete.&rdquo;<br />\nSomehow, Peter&rsquo;s able push past the lump that&rsquo;s lodged itself in his throat to say:<br />\n&ldquo;I love you too, Mr. Stark.<br />\n***<br />\nOn a Saturday afternoon, after Peter dies and then comes back to life, Mr. Stark tells Peter that he loves him for the first time and Peter lets himself believe that thing may turn out all right.</p>",
