Not too much and not often, but he gets jealous. Sero is not clingy like Bakugo is, so if you talk to someone normally he won&rsquo;t mind, but if they start to openly flirt and/or touch you be sure that it will take him literally 3 seconds to be right by your side and to end the conversation by dragging you away. </p><p>\u2022 Support by both sides.

Sero is the only one of the Bakusquad that actually knows how to be romantic, and he&rsquo;s pretty good at it. Also, probably lots of flowers.</p><p>&bull; Jealousy. Not too much and not often, but he gets jealous. Sero is not clingy like Bakugo is, so if you talk to someone normally he won&rsquo;t mind, but if they start to openly flirt and/or touch you be sure that it will take him literally 3 seconds to be right by your side and to end the conversation by dragging you away. </p><p>&bull; Support by both sides. Sero lacks of self confidence because of his quirk, so you&rsquo;ll have to remind him how amazing he is. Of course, he will do the same for you</p><p>&bull; Good morning textes, and he gets offended if you don&rsquo;t respond</p><p>&bull; Him usually calling you &ldquo;Babe&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hun&rdquo;</p><p>&bull; Cuddles on the couch for at least two hours</p><p>&bull; Having him resting on your shoulder because you&rsquo;re so soft and he loves that.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><h2>&#128125;M<b><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">ina</span></b></h2><p>&bull; Your dates mostly consist into going to the cinema and watch alien movies</p><p>&bull; Her trying to make you laugh because she just adores your smile. Also a lot of praise from her because <i>&ldquo;look at you you&rsquo;re just so amazing!!&rdquo;</i></p><p>&bull; Kisses with pink lipstick on the neck </p><p>&bull; Hugs from behind EVERYWHERE. Mina does not care if you&rsquo;re in public or not, she loves you and she is not scared to show it.</p><p>&bull; Her trying to spend all of her time with you. She&rsquo;s always enthusiastic and she would do almost everything as long as you&rsquo;re doing it together.</p><p>&bull; <i><b>SLUMBER PARTIES </b></i><strike>and sometimes the rest of the Bakuquad joins</strike></p><p>&bull; She&rsquo;ll always sing you songs that make her think of you with a sweet voice, while trying to slow dance with you.</p><p>&bull; She&rsquo;ll buy you alien-themed gifts, because if you are her s/o you probably like aliens as well</p><p>&bull; Mina will get you a pair of horns (if you already don&rsquo;t have horns on your own) to match hers. Wear them everyday and you&rsquo;ll make her the happiest pink gf in the entire Solar System</p></p>",
