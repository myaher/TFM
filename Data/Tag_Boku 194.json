Wrapping your hands around it, you proceeded to blow into the hot chocolate, making the steam curl over the borders of the cup. The warmth from both porcelain in your hand and the close-by fireplace lulled you into a pleasant state, though only when he carefully slipped onto the couch behind you, placing one arm around your waist, you felt at peace.</p><p>Sighing, you leaned back against his shoulders, while he took a sip from his own cup. From the corner of your eyes, you could watch him lick off some excess chocolate from his mouth, looking back at you with a surprised expression. \u201cDid you just see that?\u201d he asked and you nodded, giggling softly as you could see his cheeks flush.</p><p>When your laughter stopped, you leaned further back, stretching your neck to kiss the underside of his chin.

Ever since the Christmas party, the two of you have been going out, spending a lot of time by each other\u2019s side, when you have the time for it.</p><p>Taking a sip of your own drink, you hummed as the sweetness spread inside of your mouth, captivating your mind and feelings quickly. Looking to your right you had a nice view of Shouta\u2019s cup, noticing that, not like yours, it was missing. Interest spiking, you peeked a little closer, his eyes watching you as you leaned forward to inspect his cup. \u201cThere\u2019s no whipped cream if you are searching for that,\u201d he answered your question ahead of time, gaining a shocked gasp from your side.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s none? Do you not want whipped cream on your hot chocolate?\u201d He only shook his head in reply as he lifted the cup to his lips again, sipping it. \u201cNo, that\u2019s too sweet for my taste.\u201d Another gasp escaped your mouth while he gave you a roll of his eyes. \u201cTaste it, it\u2019s perfectly fine without.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping you into a full embrace, he placed the cup into your lap, waiting for you to take it from him. Skeptical, you brought it to your lips, making small sips, afraid to be shocked by the missing condiment. However, much to your own surprise, it was still good. Not exactly the best, but you couldn\u2019t hold it against him for preferring his drink like this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you judged, setting a heavy emphasis on it only being \u2018okay\u2019. \u201cWell then,\u201d he accepted your decision, taking the cup away from you again. For a while, the two of you remained in silent. Sometimes broken by the crackling of the fire and the rustling of the couch whenever either of you took a sip of your drink. After having had some of your own hot chocolate, the difference really stood out to his.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was right, the sweetness of your own being quite overwhelming. However, after drinking your hot chocolate this way for all these years, you felt quite complicated about changing it now. \u201cDon\u2019t you miss the sweetness?\u201d you asked, staring into the brown liquid as it crafted little waves inside the cup.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he returned your question, though you could hear a smile behind his voice without looking up. \u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s a little bland, isn\u2019t it. Completely without-\u201d your babbling was interrupted by a shift in his posture before he sharply spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t need more sweetness in my life. After all\u2026\u201d he paused, his hand coming to rest under your chin and he urged it up, so you\u2019d look at him too.</p><p>Easily accessible now, he united his lips with yours, sending a shiver through your body as the rustic flavor spread through your mouth, paired with the intimate affection. He only paused shortly, moving inches away from you to finish his sentence.</p><p>\u201cI have you now.\u201d</p>",

Lol, anyway, hope you guys enjoy!</p><hr><p>\u201cWho\u2019d have thought, huh\u2026\u201d you mumbled, taking the cup from Shouta as he reached it down towards you. Wrapping your hands around it, you proceeded to blow into the hot chocolate, making the steam curl over the borders of the cup. The warmth from both porcelain in your hand and the close-by fireplace lulled you into a pleasant state, though only when he carefully slipped onto the couch behind you, placing one arm around your waist, you felt at peace.</p><p>Sighing, you leaned back against his shoulders, while he took a sip from his own cup. From the corner of your eyes, you could watch him lick off some excess chocolate from his mouth, looking back at you with a surprised expression. \u201cDid you just see that?\u201d he asked and you nodded, giggling softly as you could see his cheeks flush.</p><p>When your laughter stopped, you leaned further back, stretching your neck to kiss the underside of his chin. Being so close to him was still very new, but you enjoyed every second of it. Ever since the Christmas party, the two of you have been going out, spending a lot of time by each other\u2019s side, when you have the time for it.</p><p>Taking a sip of your own drink, you hummed as the sweetness spread inside of your mouth, captivating your mind and feelings quickly. Looking to your right you had a nice view of Shouta\u2019s cup, noticing that, not like yours, it was missing. Interest spiking, you peeked a little closer, his eyes watching you as you leaned forward to inspect his cup. \u201cThere\u2019s no whipped cream if you are searching for that,\u201d he answered your question ahead of time, gaining a shocked gasp from your side.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s none? Do you not want whipped cream on your hot chocolate?\u201d He only shook his head in reply as he lifted the cup to his lips again, sipping it. \u201cNo, that\u2019s too sweet for my taste.\u201d Another gasp escaped your mouth while he gave you a roll of his eyes. \u201cTaste it, it\u2019s perfectly fine without.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping you into a full embrace, he placed the cup into your lap, waiting for you to take it from him. Skeptical, you brought it to your lips, making small sips, afraid to be shocked by the missing condiment. However, much to your own surprise, it was still good. Not exactly the best, but you couldn\u2019t hold it against him for preferring his drink like this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d you judged, setting a heavy emphasis on it only being \u2018okay\u2019. \u201cWell then,\u201d he accepted your decision, taking the cup away from you again. For a while, the two of you remained in silent. Sometimes broken by the crackling of the fire and the rustling of the couch whenever either of you took a sip of your drink. After having had some of your own hot chocolate, the difference really stood out to his.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was right, the sweetness of your own being quite overwhelming. However, after drinking your hot chocolate this way for all these years, you felt quite complicated about changing it now. \u201cDon\u2019t you miss the sweetness?\u201d you asked, staring into the brown liquid as it crafted little waves inside the cup.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he returned your question, though you could hear a smile behind his voice without looking up. \u201cWell, I mean, it\u2019s a little bland, isn\u2019t it. Completely without-\u201d your babbling was interrupted by a shift in his posture before he sharply spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t need more sweetness in my life. After all\u2026\u201d he paused, his hand coming to rest under your chin and he urged it up, so you\u2019d look at him too.</p><p>Easily accessible now, he united his lips with yours, sending a shiver through your body as the rustic flavor spread through your mouth, paired with the intimate affection. He only paused shortly, moving inches away from you to finish his sentence.</p><p>\u201cI have you now.\u201d</p>",
