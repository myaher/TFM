I wasn&rsquo;t used to it, not to the rushing heart that was thumping in my chest, or to the hollow pit in my stomach that made it difficult to breathe. I wasn&rsquo;t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.\u00a0</i></p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, am I boring you?&rdquo;</p><p>Funny enough, that&rsquo;s never a concerned question. It&rsquo;s always asked with certain annoyance and in a stern tone that commands attention, almost as if the person asking didn&rsquo;t really care about the status of your entertainment.</p><p>I looked up at her, her piercing and steely blue eyes staring at me while her red nails drummed on the table impatiently. She was wearing a black dress, without a jacket, as the sunny day in L.A. was hot enough to make you feel like going to the beach and having a couple of beers. Could you even swim in L.A.? Maybe in Corona del Mar, certainly not in Santa Monica. Never by the pier. Jesus, I was bored.\u00a0</p><p>But even then, the thought of answering sincerely didn&rsquo;t really cross my mind.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I smiled meekly at Midge, hoping the gesture would calm her down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night. What were you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>And oh, she didn&rsquo;t buy my excuse, never really did. Her eyes rolled back, just a little bit, enough to let me know she thought I was a fucking pest, but that still, she was a professional. Without saying a word, she went back to look through the magazine on her Ipad, flipping the page to stare carefully at the page-wide photo. I looked at it and felt that familiar pang of anxiety, the certainty that I was way in over my head. That someday, somehow, this dream or nightmare was going to end, and I was going to wake up back home, clad in sweat, to go back to wait tables at the dinner. Go back to fighting for a way out.\u00a0</p><p>Midge kept staring at the photo, with a clinical eye that only years and years of experience could grant. I wondered if she thought the same as I did; if the person staring back from the glossy page of the Vogue magazine was as much of a stranger to her as she was to me. Sure, she had my lips, red and pillowy from the makeup, and her hair looked as disheveled in the long braid as mine usually did, but still, she wasn&rsquo;t me. She couldn&rsquo;t be. She looked powerful and peaceful, two feelings I wasn&rsquo;t too familiar with, as she sat on a huge red velvet throne with her feet hanging in the air. Her hand was resting awkwardly above her head, and the dress, beautiful as it was, with its gauze and its pearls and its flowers, wasn&rsquo;t the most striking part of the picture, but her eyes. They were fierce and piercing and demanded to be looked at.\u00a0<br/></p><p>She wanted to be seen. She demanded it. She was in Vogue and wanted everyone to know there was a new star in town.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;This is a nice picture.&rdquo; Midge pointed at it. &ldquo;Nice work.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I replied, scrambling to look away from her as soon as she went back to inspect the rest of the magazine.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Midge&rsquo;s office was almost as impressive as she was. Her main wall was covered with photos of her clients, with people wearing their finest clothes and posing as if it was nothing; like their lives were normal and the rest of us just needed to catch up. There was Sandra Bullock in InStyle Magazine, Jennifer Lawrence on Time, and Taylor Swift on Elle. A picture of Midge and Elle and Dakota Fanning in some party was right in the middle of the mix, and I gulped, wondering when would she finally tell me to fuck off. She didn&rsquo;t need me. She would do just fine after I disappeared into thin air.\u00a0<br/></p><p>And I needed her so badly.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>I looked back at her to inspect her further, even when I had done that thousands of times before. She was wearing a simple black drape tunic that fell a little above her knees, and a pair of Alexander Mcqueen&rsquo;s sandals, with a leather bow around her ankle.\u00a0 Everything about her screamed boss, and I was adequately scared of her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&ldquo;We need more photos,&rdquo; She said, without raising her voice, which made me think she wasn&rsquo;t even talking to me. &ldquo;We want you everywhere during award season.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I will make sure I am seen everywhere,&rdquo; I offered, but I was received with a dismissing wave of her hand, right before she got up to serve herself some water, or at least what I hoped was water.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll take care of it. I have&hellip;something in the works already.&rdquo; She turned, offering me an odd smile that made me shift on my chair. I picked up an ambiguity in her tone, like even that tiny bit of information was already saying too much, and I gulped nervously, looking at her as she walked calmly back to her chair. I debated whether I should ask her about it, or just nod, to put myself on her bad side or just let her do her job. On one side, she was fucking good at it and I thanked all of my stars to have her. On the other side, &ldquo;something in the works&rdquo; is never enough information, much less when you&rsquo;re the one on the receiving end.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Midge, can I ask&hellip;&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, honey.&rdquo; She smiled condescendingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when it&rsquo;s all ready. Until then, let&rsquo;s focus on getting you as many nominations as we can. We&rsquo;re going after an Oscar, let&rsquo;s not forget that.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>The Oscar, the only thing being talked about around me even before the movie came out. If anything, I was incredibly happy I had the chance to play make-believe, dress fancy and run around talking with a British accent. To work along well-established actors, and to have their grace and support, it was more than I ever expected. Much more than I could ever dream of.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Also, my performance had been buzzed about before, raved between critics and peers, and not even that had gotten me a nomination.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Even a sliver of hope seemed too risky at this point. And I knew it, knew the heartache that was coming my way if I wasn&rsquo;t on the list of nominees. But even then, I couldn&rsquo;t help it, couldn&rsquo;t help but wish for it, imagine myself crying as I hugged my mother when they called for my name, and the words I would say as I held the golden bald man in my trembling hand: &ldquo;Thank you, God. Thanks, mom&hellip;&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I can get it? That I can get an award?&rdquo; I asked her, holding my breath as I waited for her answer. Maybe she had picked up the doubt in my voice, or the fact that it quivered a little at the end. I felt small, almost expecting a laugh and a resounding no, but Midge smiled instead, turning to look at me with a soft expression I didn&rsquo;t know she was capable of.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re incredibly talented, honey. I wouldn&rsquo;t be representing you if you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;I think you can get it, and that you deserve it, and I&rsquo;m just gonna push you in the right direction, so I need you to trust me, yes?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Anything she wanted, everything she needed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&quot;\u00a0<br/></p><p>Well, not everything.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Or maybe yes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I still hadn&rsquo;t decided.\u00a0<br/></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>The meeting went on for about 15 more minutes, during which, Midge seemed to grow more distracted until she finally dismissed me. I tried not to jump up from the chair and run out of that office but left pretty quickly anyway, rushing through the corridors jammed with cubicles, and trying to ignore the head peeking out of the white cardboard separators.<br/></p><p>The rush of a dream, a grand one, was making my heart beat faster, and my smile grow bigger as I head to the lobby. I tried to calm myself down, to not give in to the fantasy, but my mind kept rushing with the images of the balls, and the dresses, and how beautiful the statuettes would look in my living room.<br/></p><p>&quot;Hey!&rdquo;<br/></p><p>My heart came to a sudden stop, as I turned around to see him. He was sitting on the black couch in front of the receptionist counter, and was looking at me with a mix of bewilderment and amusement. Sam was wearing all black, and his curly hair was starting to get too long to behave, so it just flopped on his forehead. I smiled at him as he started to get up and let him take my bag out of my hands for him to carry.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to wait for me, y'know?<br/></p><p>&quot;Well, you promised sushi.&rdquo; He shrugged off, smiling widely as I bumped my shoulder against his in protest.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;So, let&rsquo;s get sushi,&rdquo; I agreed, following behind him as he started to make his way out of the building. The day was incredibly shiny, and the air was crispy and I felt giddy, walking to his car as if I was on a cloud.<br/></p><p>Sam had this thing about him, something that made everything easier when he was next to me. His smile could light up a room, like a burden had lifted off my shoulders, and his company made me feel safe, maybe from how many times he had saved me before.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&ldquo;So, how did it go with Midge?&rdquo; He asked while he got ready to turn on the engine to leave. He pronounced her name with an edge, just like he did since she had asked us to keep our friendship from the public eye. We appreciate your privacy, Sam. Hanging out so much will only get you trouble.<br/></p><p>But Sam only saw me as his friend. I should know, I wish he didn&rsquo;t.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;It went well, she said she has something in the works for me.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Like what?<br/></p><p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;I&rsquo;m a bit scared if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you should be,\u201d He said. Sam was considering his next words, I could see by the way his eyebrows scrunched up right in the middle, and by the chewing of his bottom lip. He looked at me, with his big hazel eyes, and his mouth twitched a little. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to be a teacher? It seems easier\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAn actress, Sam,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll make enough money, so we\u2019ll never have to go back.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t ever have to go back. I\u2019ll never let you.\u201d<br/></p><p>I believed him. I could still remember the smell of his drenched jacket when he started his car before we drove away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&quot;I know,&rdquo; I replied simply. &ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s also fun, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;If you say so.&quot;\u00a0<br/></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><h2><b>- Info you need to know -</b></h2><p><b>Name of the show</b>: The Late Late Show with James Corden.</p><p><b>Host</b>: James Kimberley Corden (Do not call him Kimberley).\u00a0</p><p><b>Time slot</b>: 12:37am/11:37pm c</p><p><b>Banned subjects</b>: Kardashians/Kanye; Trump; how much you hated &lsquo;Love Actually&rsquo;; how Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy needs to end.\u00a0</p><p><b>Encouraged conversations</b>: Your movie (the Oscar one, not The Kissing List), your love life (we&rsquo;ll feed you cues), how hot you think Rihanna is.

I didn&rsquo;t know what it was about, or why it had to be so early in the morning, all I knew was that I was late and that she was probably going to chew my head off.\u00a0</p><p>By the time I got to her office, it was already 8:35, and I was sweaty and panting, breathless from running the flights of stairs to the 8th floor, as it was almost impossible to get into an elevator at that hour. A light layer of sweat was forming over my forehead, and the fishtail braid I had begged my little sister to do was falling apart. It wasn&rsquo;t my best look, but there was nothing I could do about it.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hi, Diana, I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;m late. Cat missed the school bus and I had to take her. Yes, I know, you don&rsquo;t care&hellip;</i></p><p>I expected to find Diana fuming, with her arms crossed on her chest and a carefully threaded eyebrow raised almost to her scalp. I expected her to be so angry at my tardiness, that she refused to see me for an hour or two, even if there was nothing else on her calendar, just to teach me a lesson. I was ready for it, actually.\u00a0</p><p>So, when I pushed the door open, and I found her laughing, it was almost disappointing.</p><p>The chirpy blonde (Midge&rsquo;s second best agent!!!) did not notice my arrival, nor did the two guys that were chatting with her. It wasn&rsquo;t until I closed the door behind me that they turned to look at me. The conversation died down, and an awkward silence took over the room while everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on me.\u00a0</p><p>The guy to the right was about D&rsquo;s age, 34 or 35 years old, tall and handsome. He was wearing a simple gray peacoat and a pair of black jeans and was holding a bunch of papers in his hands. He nodded, almost in recognition, and I offered him a small smile in return.</p><p>The guy to the left, well, I recognized him. It would be almost impossible not to.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Hi,&rdquo; I heard myself mumble, looking at him as he stared back at me.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Harry,&rdquo; He said as his lips twitched into half a smile. I noticed that he was wearing a black knit sweater, and was trying to jam his fingers into the pocket of his black jeans, however, the heavy looking rings on his fingers didn&rsquo;t allow him to do so.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I, I know,&rdquo; I replied.</p><p>Whatever was happening, I could only describe it as an out-of-body experience, almost as if I were looking at myself from the other side of the room, mocking me for my own awkwardness.\u00a0</p><p>Or maybe I was just starstruck.\u00a0</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t look away from him. His lopsided smile grew bigger,\u00a0 and he cocked his head slightly to the side, staring at me as if there was nothing else that could possibly interest him in that room. A new feeling, the small, warm flutter that started at the pit of my stomach, maybe it was just my heart that was starting to race in my chest.\u00a0</p><p>Time had stopped, it had to, as there was no way I had spent so much time looking at him, and standing awkwardly in the middle of a room, while other two people witnessed my stupidity. I wasn&rsquo;t used to it, not to the rushing heart that was thumping in my chest, or to the hollow pit in my stomach that made it difficult to breathe. I wasn&rsquo;t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Diana was looking at us, her green eyes dancing from one to the other while a coy smile started to form on her lips. &ldquo;Can we continue?&rdquo;</p><p>She was mocking me, of that I was certain. Her eyes followed me until I took a seat next to the other guy, whose name I had totally missed, and smirked when I finally looked at her. My cheeks felt hot, and my heart seemed to barely be recovering from a marathon.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; She continued, recovering her serious face as she turned to face us all. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing: We have an offer to make, which we think might benefit all of us. Our client is an up-and-coming Hollywood star, and as you may, or may not, know, we&rsquo;re pushing for her to be an Oscar nominee this award season. We almost have the Golden Globes nomination in the bag, and we&rsquo;re being as careful as possible with her overall image and fame.&rdquo;</p><p>I almost felt like I wasn&rsquo;t in the room, as if Diana wasn&rsquo;t talking about me. It was all too clinical, too impersonal, and I felt far away from it. I peered to my side and saw the guy next to me shifting awkwardly in his seat, just like if he knew what was coming, and regretted it deeply. As if he was waiting for a train to crash, and all he could do was stand there and let it happen.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;The movie she was in was very particular.&rdquo; Diana smiled, looking at me for the first time since she started. &ldquo;And she was wonderful in it. We&rsquo;re certain she&rsquo;ll have no problem creating buzz for herself, but&hellip;we&rsquo;d like to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Help how?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Ben, would you like to continue?&rdquo;</p><p>The guy next to me, whose name was Ben, didn&rsquo;t seem like he wanted to continue. He didn&rsquo;t seem like he wanted to be there actually, but he stood up and leaned against Diana&rsquo;s desk to look at us.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; He started. &ldquo;I owe Midge a favor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s reassuring.&rdquo; I heard Harry mock under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;We want to spread a rumor, and not deny it, about you two.&rdquo; He ignored Harry, and looked at me, as if I was an easier audience that would understand what was wanted of me. &ldquo;We want you to hang out, and act like a couple, a romantic one.&rdquo; But the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t protesting, or even talking, was not because I agreed with whatever he was saying, but rather, because I had no fucking idea of what was happening. Instead, I just stared at him dumbfounded. &ldquo;We think it might give you an edge. Your movie is about to hit theaters, and it might push people to go and check it out, just to see who&rsquo;s that girl Harry&rsquo;s dating. That and the buzz you already got during the festivals&rsquo; screenings, you might have a great chance next year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; Diana interjected. &ldquo;It might tip the balance in your favor in the Josh and Hazel&rsquo;s Guide to not Dating&rsquo;s casting. People don&rsquo;t really see you as a romantic lead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And, for you, Harry.&rdquo; Ben was rather cautious as he continued. &ldquo;We think it might give you exposure to a broader audience, and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need exposure,&rdquo; Harry shook his head.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;You do. You&rsquo;re nothing without it, and that&rsquo;s exactly what you don&rsquo;t want to be,&rdquo; Diana explained in a rather cold tone. More like the Diana I knew and feared. &ldquo;We also think you&rsquo;ll be a really good Josh. If this all works out, who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll even lead the movie. That&rsquo;s something people would love to see.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled at him, despite the fact that there was a deep set frown in his forehead, and that his face was not very friendly at that very moment. I still couldn&rsquo;t quite shake the feeling that this was happening to someone else, not to me. It couldn&rsquo;t be happening to me.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you two talk, I&rsquo;m gonna get the papers ready,&rdquo; she said, taking Ben&rsquo;s hand to pull him out of the room to leave us alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I can act romantic,&rdquo; I mumbled as soon as she closed the door.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; I let my hand ran through my hair before looking at him. He was already staring at me, with that same intensity as when I first entered the room. He looked tired, and his eyes were puffy like he had barely gotten any sleep the night before. He switched on his seat until he was fully facing me, with his feet dangling from the arm-chair while he leaned back to the wall to make himself comfortable. The colorful planets on his black sweater made me smile, and before I could blush under his gaze, I looked down to my lap, not uttering a word as I felt his eyes on me.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I like your movies.&rdquo; I heard him say.\u00a0</p><p>My eyes rose to his, which was definitely a mistake. It was easier not to look at him, not to see the way his pink mouth twitched when he was deep in thought and the anchor tattoo that was peeking under his black sweater. He was prettier by the minute, and I could feel a strange pull in my tummy, one I had never felt before, and I still couldn&rsquo;t decide if it was a good or a bad feeling.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. My little sister really likes your music.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; He asked in amusement.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I, I like Fireproof.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;That&rsquo;s a 1D song.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I still like it.&rdquo; I shrugged off, feeling elated as his sweet smile spread on his lips, showing off his bunny teeth and the dimples on his cheek. &ldquo;And Woman, I like Woman.&rdquo;</p><p>The fluttering in my stomach seemed to be growing, and I had to wonder if I was going to explode at any second now. He leaned forward, as if he was ready to tell me some big secret, and bit the corner of his lip as he got ready to say his next words.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to do this?&rdquo; He finally said.\u00a0</p><p>I did. I didn&rsquo;t. I had no idea.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;ll work?&rdquo; My voice didn&rsquo;t sound like my own. It was laced with doubt and something else that I couldn&rsquo;t quite describe yet.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;People will believe whatever they want.&rdquo; He shrugged, returning my gesture in an effortless way.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&hellip;I just, I never seem to know how far I want this to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As far as you can go without losing yourself.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;How do you know you&rsquo;re not losing yourself?&rdquo; I asked in response, looking at him as his expression turned just a little bit darker. For a person so private, his face said too much.</p><p>&ldquo;You never really do,&rdquo; Harry whispered. &ldquo;I guess, you have to go with your gut.&rdquo;</p><p>My gut. My gut was untrusting and anxious, ready to flee at any second. It had done it before, now it was just waiting for a new opportunity to do it again, really.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; The words came out of my words even before I had processed. So easy, it almost hid the fact that I was an anxious-ridden mess on the inside. &ldquo;If&hellip;If you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell if he actually liked my answer. All of the sudden he got serious as if he had just realized what he was getting himself into, and he sighed, standing up from his chair to perch himself on Diana&rsquo;s desk in front of me. He was towering over me, which made me shift uncomfortably in my seat. When he noticed, he sat up straight, giving me some space to breathe better.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it then,&rdquo; He whispered. There was a tiny hint of disappointment, that grew from my chest and spread to my stomach at the tone of his voice as if this was an irritating chore.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do it. You don&rsquo;t know me after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have time to do that.&rdquo; He softened a little, looking at me with a small smile as I leaned back on my chair and crossed my arms around my chest in a protective way. &ldquo;Do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Sam.</i>\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A boyfriend, no,&rdquo; He mocked, smirking as my eyes blew wide in embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;uh, I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t mean a boyfriend. I was, I was asking for a girlfriend, but if you do have a boyfriend, I mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend either.&rdquo; He finally put an end to my misery. &ldquo;It makes things easier.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know what he meant and I decided against asking him about it. Instead, I chose to focus on the fact that he was single, which definitely gave me something to dream about. Even if I knew nothing was going to happen. Even if I knew this whole thing was nothing but an inconvenience for him.\u00a0</p><p>That didn&rsquo;t stop the fluttering in my stomach. Probably nothing would.</p><p>I was about to say something when the door opened, and Diana entered the room with Ben. They were holding a bunch of papers each, which she set over her desk before throwing a triumphant smile at us.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I think this is all we need.&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go through them before you take them to your team. Oh, and there&rsquo;s a party tonight, I want you both there. We need to set things in motion.&rdquo;</p><p>After that, there was nothing much to say, or do. Ben and Diana took over the conversation, arranging little details that I couldn&rsquo;t even begin to imagine. It was all a blur, of contracts and NDAs and rules that I was supposed to follow, but couldn&rsquo;t even remember. By the time they left, my head was spinning and I had to close my eyes tightly to stop myself from getting dizzy.\u00a0</p><p>Diana had about a billion things more to discuss with me, ranging from the interview with James Corden, to new scripts, to the outfits I should wear to drop Cat at school, AKA something that didn&rsquo;t make me look like a crazy person walking through the streets of L.A. But there was too much in my head already, excitement, fear, numbling anxiety, and I could barely keep up with her, as she continued to check things from her to-do list. It was already 19:30 when was finally done, and I had about 1 hour to get ready for the party Diana wanted me to go.\u00a0</p><p>I was so tired. I just wanted to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, you can go now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. Di, can I just&hellip;take a raincheck on that party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t. Harry&rsquo;s coming to get you at 9:15.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, D&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have fun, sweets.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t let me finish. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sooooo hot, try and behave.&rdquo;</p><p>He was, that was exactly the problem.\u00a0</p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>What Diana had forgotten to tell me was that Harry was not going to pick me up himself. Rather, his driver showed up to my front door, waiting patiently for me for about 20 more minutes until I was ready.</p><p>I was surprised when we got to the venue, as there were not as many paparazzi as I had thought there would be. Actually, there was none. There was only a couple of people by the door, and they all looked at me with surprised expressions as I walked by them, followed by Harry&rsquo;s driver.</p><p>It was never a good idea for me to go out. I got hugged and pulled and stared at. But here, everyone was calm, probably used to hanging out with people a lot more famous than me. I sucked in a deep breath, smiling at the people that waved at me and sometimes stopping to greet the people that I actually knew. As a result, it took me around 15 minutes to get to Harry&rsquo;s group.\u00a0</p><p>He was leaning against the wall, holding a glass in his hand while he listened attentively to the girl that was standing in front of him. She was gorgeous, with her long hair layered in loose curls, and a red tight dress fitted like a glove to her absolutely drool-worthy body. She leaned over as if to tell him a secret, and he cocked his head to the side to allow her to do so. I could hear her flirty giggles, and I stopped where I was, suddenly realizing that I did not belong there.\u00a0</p><p>What was I doing? This wasn&rsquo;t me.\u00a0</p><p>I turned around before anyone could see me, and started my way back to the door. If I called an uber, I would be at home in around 30 minutes, and maybe Sam would go and watch movies with me. He could even bring his girlfriend! I was used to it.\u00a0</p><p>I stood by the bar, leaning on it as I pulled out my phone from my clutch. I was glad I hadn&rsquo;t wasted a whole lot of time in my outfit, and that I had decided to wear a pair of black jeans and a t-shirt tucked in, with red heels and a black blazer, that way I didn&rsquo;t feel so disappointed, or embarrassed for the thousands of situations I had pictured in my head.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like something to drink?&rdquo; I heard someone shout at me, which made me turn around to smile to the bartender.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;N&hellip;A shot of tequila, please.&rdquo; I found myself saying, to the bartender&rsquo;s pleasure. He winked at me and nodded solemnly as if mine was a great choice of alcohol.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Coming right up!&rdquo;</p><p>And he was right, as about a second later there was a short glass in front of me, dripping from tequila. He offered me salt and a wedge of lime, and I gladly took them before gulping down the shot. The dry liquor burned my throat on its way down, and I winced at the taste, slamming the glass on the table for him to refill.\u00a0</p><p>But before I could grab the new shot he was offering me, someone else took it. I whirled around, ready to tell someone off, but instead, saw Harry as he tipped the glass and chugged it down, wincing as soon as he had finished. The salt and the lime the bartender had offered me were left unattended on the bar.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that was mine!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; He said. The bar was a little quieter than the rest of the bar, so I noticed that his voice was a little hoarser than I remembered it from the morning.\u00a0 &ldquo;Saw you drinking one on my way here. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>I could feel we were being watched closely by about a hundred people. I could feel their eyes, burning hole on my back as Harry leaned closer to me. He smelled of alcohol and a little bit of mint, and I struggled to stay still where I was, starting to recognize the signs of the strange feeling that had taken over me in the morning.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I was about to leave,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;But was offered alcohol, so I ummm&hellip;got distracted for a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why were you leaving?&rdquo; Harry was pulling out his wallet, and before I could do anything about it, he handed the barman his credit card, signaling for two more shots to come.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh, I saw you back there, with the cute girl! I don&rsquo;t want to impose, Harry, and you&rsquo;re definitely gonna score with her, so I just&hellip;I can&rsquo;t mess with that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna score?&rdquo; He seemed amused by my affirmation, but I still nodded vigorously, taking the new shot I was being offered and downing it. It burned a little more and made my head a little more fuzzy than it was after the first one.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;You totally are, and she&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; I said, with my tongue feeling a little heavy as I talked.\u00a0</p><p>Harry smirked like he knew I was right, and the girl was probably a goddess put on earth so we could all feel a little ashamed of ourselves. Kind of a reality check in the body of a breathtaking model.\u00a0</p><p>He took his shot and drank it in one gulp, just like I had done seconds before. He winced, scrunching up his nose and smiling like a little kid as he slammed the glass down.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, you couldn&rsquo;t choose another drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like tequila,&rdquo; I shrugged, leaning to him to bump my shoulder against his. I stayed there, close to him as I smelled his faint cologne and the bitter alcohol in his breath. &ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m gonna go. You go get the girl, and we try this another day, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you do! That girl was hot as fuck, and it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m gonna give it to you&hellip;&rdquo; I stopped, growing hotter in embarrassment as I looked at him amused face. &ldquo;I should shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>His hands were warm and soft and they made my skin tingle as one of them slid carefully to the back of my neck. I stopped breathing, only able to look at him as he pulled me closer to his chest until his breath was fanning over my skin and I could almost taste the bittersweetness of his lips. I took a deep breath, noticing the little smile that played on his lips before he pressed our lips together.\u00a0</p><p>The kiss wasn&rsquo;t soft, nor was it rough either. It was uncertain and eager as if we wanted to learn as much about each other as we possibly could. His fingers curled around my neck, as he brought me closer to him, and one of my hands tangled in the soft hairs that rested on the nape of his neck. He tasted like peppermint and tequila, and a sweetness I could not describe. My lips parted slightly, and I sighed into the kiss as he took command of it. Our lips were made for each other, of that I was sure, and I allowed myself to mold to him, while time around us stopped and rushed by at the same time. I leaned to him when he broke the kiss apart, looking for the warmth of his body even though he was right next by my side.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of cameras pointing at us.&rdquo; He whispered while his fingertips brushed down my neck, keeping me still close to him.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, dissipating the heaviness that had set in my tummy at his words. &ldquo;And I really wanted to kiss you since this morning. You should stay.&rdquo;&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;Ask me really nicely, I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; I whispered, almost against his lips, already dreaming about the taste of them.\u00a0</p><p>He was definitely trouble.\u00a0</p>",

I wasn\u2019t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.\u00a0</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, am I boring you?\u201d</p><p>Funny enough, that\u2019s never a concerned question. It\u2019s always asked with certain annoyance and in a stern tone that commands attention, almost as if the person asking didn\u2019t really care about the status of your entertainment.</p><p>I looked up at her, her piercing and steely blue eyes staring at me while her red nails drummed on the table impatiently. She was wearing a black dress, without a jacket, as the sunny day in L.A. was hot enough to make you feel like going to the beach and having a couple of beers. Could you even swim in L.A.? Maybe in Corona del Mar, certainly not in Santa Monica. Never by the pier. Jesus, I was bored.\u00a0</p><p>But even then, the thought of answering sincerely didn\u2019t really cross my mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I smiled meekly at Midge, hoping the gesture would calm her down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get much sleep last night. What were you saying?\u201d</p><p>And oh, she didn\u2019t buy my excuse, never really did. Her eyes rolled back, just a little bit, enough to let me know she thought I was a fucking pest, but that still, she was a professional. Without saying a word, she went back to look through the magazine on her Ipad, flipping the page to stare carefully at the page-wide photo. I looked at it and felt that familiar pang of anxiety, the certainty that I was way in over my head. That someday, somehow, this dream or nightmare was going to end, and I was going to wake up back home, clad in sweat, to go back to wait tables at the dinner. Go back to fighting for a way out.\u00a0</p><p>Midge kept staring at the photo, with a clinical eye that only years and years of experience could grant. I wondered if she thought the same as I did; if the person staring back from the glossy page of the Vogue magazine was as much of a stranger to her as she was to me. Sure, she had my lips, red and pillowy from the makeup, and her hair looked as disheveled in the long braid as mine usually did, but still, she wasn\u2019t me. She couldn\u2019t be. She looked powerful and peaceful, two feelings I wasn\u2019t too familiar with, as she sat on a huge red velvet throne with her feet hanging in the air. Her hand was resting awkwardly above her head, and the dress, beautiful as it was, with its gauze and its pearls and its flowers, wasn\u2019t the most striking part of the picture, but her eyes. They were fierce and piercing and demanded to be looked at.\u00a0<br></p><p>She wanted to be seen. She demanded it. She was in Vogue and wanted everyone to know there was a new star in town.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is a nice picture.\u201d Midge pointed at it. \u201cNice work.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I replied, scrambling to look away from her as soon as she went back to inspect the rest of the magazine.\u00a0<br></p><p>Midge\u2019s office was almost as impressive as she was. Her main wall was covered with photos of her clients, with people wearing their finest clothes and posing as if it was nothing; like their lives were normal and the rest of us just needed to catch up. There was Sandra Bullock in InStyle Magazine, Jennifer Lawrence on Time, and Taylor Swift on Elle. A picture of Midge and Elle and Dakota Fanning in some party was right in the middle of the mix, and I gulped, wondering when would she finally tell me to fuck off. She didn\u2019t need me. She would do just fine after I disappeared into thin air.\u00a0<br></p><p>And I needed her so badly.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>I looked back at her to inspect her further, even when I had done that thousands of times before. She was wearing a simple black drape tunic that fell a little above her knees, and a pair of Alexander Mcqueen\u2019s sandals, with a leather bow around her ankle.\u00a0 Everything about her screamed boss, and I was adequately scared of her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe need more photos,\u201d She said, without raising her voice, which made me think she wasn\u2019t even talking to me. \u201cWe want you everywhere during award season.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI will make sure I am seen everywhere,\u201d I offered, but I was received with a dismissing wave of her hand, right before she got up to serve herself some water, or at least what I hoped was water.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll take care of it. I have\u2026something in the works already.\u201d She turned, offering me an odd smile that made me shift on my chair. I picked up an ambiguity in her tone, like even that tiny bit of information was already saying too much, and I gulped nervously, looking at her as she walked calmly back to her chair. I debated whether I should ask her about it, or just nod, to put myself on her bad side or just let her do her job. On one side, she was fucking good at it and I thanked all of my stars to have her. On the other side, \u201csomething in the works\u201d is never enough information, much less when you\u2019re the one on the receiving end.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMidge, can I ask\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, honey.\u201d She smiled condescendingly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s all ready. Until then, let\u2019s focus on getting you as many nominations as we can. We\u2019re going after an Oscar, let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d<br></p><p>The Oscar, the only thing being talked about around me even before the movie came out. If anything, I was incredibly happy I had the chance to play make-believe, dress fancy and run around talking with a British accent. To work along well-established actors, and to have their grace and support, it was more than I ever expected. Much more than I could ever dream of.\u00a0<br></p><p>Also, my performance had been buzzed about before, raved between critics and peers, and not even that had gotten me a nomination.\u00a0<br></p><p>Even a sliver of hope seemed too risky at this point. And I knew it, knew the heartache that was coming my way if I wasn\u2019t on the list of nominees. But even then, I couldn\u2019t help it, couldn\u2019t help but wish for it, imagine myself crying as I hugged my mother when they called for my name, and the words I would say as I held the golden bald man in my trembling hand: \u201cThank you, God. Thanks, mom\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDo you think I can get it? That I can get an award?\u201d I asked her, holding my breath as I waited for her answer. Maybe she had picked up the doubt in my voice, or the fact that it quivered a little at the end. I felt small, almost expecting a laugh and a resounding no, but Midge smiled instead, turning to look at me with a soft expression I didn\u2019t know she was capable of.<br></p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re incredibly talented, honey. I wouldn\u2019t be representing you if you weren\u2019t.\u201d She said. \u201cI think you can get it, and that you deserve it, and I\u2019m just gonna push you in the right direction, so I need you to trust me, yes?\u201d<br></p><p>Anything she wanted, everything she needed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\"\u00a0<br></p><p>Well, not everything.\u00a0<br></p><p>Or maybe yes.\u00a0<br></p><p>I still hadn\u2019t decided.\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>The meeting went on for about 15 more minutes, during which, Midge seemed to grow more distracted until she finally dismissed me. I tried not to jump up from the chair and run out of that office but left pretty quickly anyway, rushing through the corridors jammed with cubicles, and trying to ignore the head peeking out of the white cardboard separators.<br></p><p>The rush of a dream, a grand one, was making my heart beat faster, and my smile grow bigger as I head to the lobby. I tried to calm myself down, to not give in to the fantasy, but my mind kept rushing with the images of the balls, and the dresses, and how beautiful the statuettes would look in my living room.<br></p><p>\"Hey!\u201d<br></p><p>My heart came to a sudden stop, as I turned around to see him. He was sitting on the black couch in front of the receptionist counter, and was looking at me with a mix of bewilderment and amusement. Sam was wearing all black, and his curly hair was starting to get too long to behave, so it just flopped on his forehead. I smiled at him as he started to get up and let him take my bag out of my hands for him to carry.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait for me, y'know?<br></p><p>\"Well, you promised sushi.\u201d He shrugged off, smiling widely as I bumped my shoulder against his in protest.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s get sushi,\u201d I agreed, following behind him as he started to make his way out of the building. The day was incredibly shiny, and the air was crispy and I felt giddy, walking to his car as if I was on a cloud.<br></p><p>Sam had this thing about him, something that made everything easier when he was next to me. His smile could light up a room, like a burden had lifted off my shoulders, and his company made me feel safe, maybe from how many times he had saved me before.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo, how did it go with Midge?\u201d He asked while he got ready to turn on the engine to leave. He pronounced her name with an edge, just like he did since she had asked us to keep our friendship from the public eye. We appreciate your privacy, Sam. Hanging out so much will only get you trouble.<br></p><p>But Sam only saw me as his friend. I should know, I wish he didn\u2019t.<br></p><p>\u201cIt went well, she said she has something in the works for me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike what?<br></p><p>\"I don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m a bit scared if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you should be,\u201d He said. Sam was considering his next words, I could see by the way his eyebrows scrunched up right in the middle, and by the chewing of his bottom lip. He looked at me, with his big hazel eyes, and his mouth twitched a little. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to be a teacher? It seems easier\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAn actress, Sam,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll make enough money, so we\u2019ll never have to go back.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t ever have to go back. I\u2019ll never let you.\u201d<br></p><p>I believed him. I could still remember the smell of his drenched jacket when he started his car before we drove away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\"I know,\u201d I replied simply. \u201cBut, it\u2019s also fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\"\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><h2><b>- Info you need to know -</b></h2><p><b>Name of the show</b>: The Late Late Show with James Corden.</p><p><b>Host</b>: James Kimberley Corden (Do not call him Kimberley).\u00a0</p><p><b>Time slot</b>: 12:37am/11:37pm c</p><p><b>Banned subjects</b>: Kardashians/Kanye; Trump; how much you hated \u2018Love Actually\u2019; how Grey\u2019s Anatomy needs to end.\u00a0</p><p><b>Encouraged conversations</b>: Your movie (the Oscar one, not The Kissing List), your love life (we\u2019ll feed you cues), how hot you think Rihanna is.

I didn\u2019t know what it was about, or why it had to be so early in the morning, all I knew was that I was late and that she was probably going to chew my head off.\u00a0</p><p>By the time I got to her office, it was already 8:35, and I was sweaty and panting, breathless from running the flights of stairs to the 8th floor, as it was almost impossible to get into an elevator at that hour. A light layer of sweat was forming over my forehead, and the fishtail braid I had begged my little sister to do was falling apart. It wasn\u2019t my best look, but there was nothing I could do about it.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hi, Diana, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m late. Cat missed the school bus and I had to take her. Yes, I know, you don\u2019t care\u2026</i></p><p>I expected to find Diana fuming, with her arms crossed on her chest and a carefully threaded eyebrow raised almost to her scalp. I expected her to be so angry at my tardiness, that she refused to see me for an hour or two, even if there was nothing else on her calendar, just to teach me a lesson. I was ready for it, actually.\u00a0</p><p>So, when I pushed the door open, and I found her laughing, it was almost disappointing.</p><p>The chirpy blonde (Midge\u2019s second best agent!!!) did not notice my arrival, nor did the two guys that were chatting with her. It wasn\u2019t until I closed the door behind me that they turned to look at me. The conversation died down, and an awkward silence took over the room while everyone\u2019s eyes fell on me.\u00a0</p><p>The guy to the right was about D\u2019s age, 34 or 35 years old, tall and handsome. He was wearing a simple gray peacoat and a pair of black jeans and was holding a bunch of papers in his hands. He nodded, almost in recognition, and I offered him a small smile in return.</p><p>The guy to the left, well, I recognized him. It would be almost impossible not to.\u00a0</p><p>\"Hi,\u201d I heard myself mumble, looking at him as he stared back at me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Harry,\u201d He said as his lips twitched into half a smile. I noticed that he was wearing a black knit sweater, and was trying to jam his fingers into the pocket of his black jeans, however, the heavy looking rings on his fingers didn\u2019t allow him to do so.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, I know,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Whatever was happening, I could only describe it as an out-of-body experience, almost as if I were looking at myself from the other side of the room, mocking me for my own awkwardness.\u00a0</p><p>Or maybe I was just starstruck.\u00a0</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look away from him. His lopsided smile grew bigger,\u00a0 and he cocked his head slightly to the side, staring at me as if there was nothing else that could possibly interest him in that room. A new feeling, the small, warm flutter that started at the pit of my stomach, maybe it was just my heart that was starting to race in my chest.\u00a0</p><p>Time had stopped, it had to, as there was no way I had spent so much time looking at him, and standing awkwardly in the middle of a room, while other two people witnessed my stupidity. I wasn\u2019t used to it, not to the rushing heart that was thumping in my chest, or to the hollow pit in my stomach that made it difficult to breathe. I wasn\u2019t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Diana was looking at us, her green eyes dancing from one to the other while a coy smile started to form on her lips. \u201cCan we continue?\u201d</p><p>She was mocking me, of that I was certain. Her eyes followed me until I took a seat next to the other guy, whose name I had totally missed, and smirked when I finally looked at her. My cheeks felt hot, and my heart seemed to barely be recovering from a marathon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d She continued, recovering her serious face as she turned to face us all. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: We have an offer to make, which we think might benefit all of us. Our client is an up-and-coming Hollywood star, and as you may, or may not, know, we\u2019re pushing for her to be an Oscar nominee this award season. We almost have the Golden Globes nomination in the bag, and we\u2019re being as careful as possible with her overall image and fame.\u201d</p><p>I almost felt like I wasn\u2019t in the room, as if Diana wasn\u2019t talking about me. It was all too clinical, too impersonal, and I felt far away from it. I peered to my side and saw the guy next to me shifting awkwardly in his seat, just like if he knew what was coming, and regretted it deeply. As if he was waiting for a train to crash, and all he could do was stand there and let it happen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe movie she was in was very particular.\u201d Diana smiled, looking at me for the first time since she started. \u201cAnd she was wonderful in it. We\u2019re certain she\u2019ll have no problem creating buzz for herself, but\u2026we\u2019d like to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp how?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBen, would you like to continue?\u201d</p><p>The guy next to me, whose name was Ben, didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to continue. He didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to be there actually, but he stood up and leaned against Diana\u2019s desk to look at us.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d He started. \u201cI owe Midge a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring.\u201d I heard Harry mock under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWe want to spread a rumor, and not deny it, about you two.\u201d He ignored Harry, and looked at me, as if I was an easier audience that would understand what was wanted of me. \u201cWe want you to hang out, and act like a couple, a romantic one.\u201d But the fact that I wasn\u2019t protesting, or even talking, was not because I agreed with whatever he was saying, but rather, because I had no fucking idea of what was happening. Instead, I just stared at him dumbfounded. \u201cWe think it might give you an edge. Your movie is about to hit theaters, and it might push people to go and check it out, just to see who\u2019s that girl Harry\u2019s dating. That and the buzz you already got during the festivals\u2019 screenings, you might have a great chance next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso,\u201d Diana interjected. \u201cIt might tip the balance in your favor in the Josh and Hazel\u2019s Guide to not Dating\u2019s casting. People don\u2019t really see you as a romantic lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, for you, Harry.\u201d Ben was rather cautious as he continued. \u201cWe think it might give you exposure to a broader audience, and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need exposure,\u201d Harry shook his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou do. You\u2019re nothing without it, and that\u2019s exactly what you don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Diana explained in a rather cold tone. More like the Diana I knew and feared. \u201cWe also think you\u2019ll be a really good Josh. If this all works out, who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even lead the movie. That\u2019s something people would love to see.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, despite the fact that there was a deep set frown in his forehead, and that his face was not very friendly at that very moment. I still couldn\u2019t quite shake the feeling that this was happening to someone else, not to me. It couldn\u2019t be happening to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you two talk, I\u2019m gonna get the papers ready,\u201d she said, taking Ben\u2019s hand to pull him out of the room to leave us alone.</p><p>\u201cI can act romantic,\u201d I mumbled as soon as she closed the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I let my hand ran through my hair before looking at him. He was already staring at me, with that same intensity as when I first entered the room. He looked tired, and his eyes were puffy like he had barely gotten any sleep the night before. He switched on his seat until he was fully facing me, with his feet dangling from the arm-chair while he leaned back to the wall to make himself comfortable. The colorful planets on his black sweater made me smile, and before I could blush under his gaze, I looked down to my lap, not uttering a word as I felt his eyes on me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like your movies.\u201d I heard him say.\u00a0</p><p>My eyes rose to his, which was definitely a mistake. It was easier not to look at him, not to see the way his pink mouth twitched when he was deep in thought and the anchor tattoo that was peeking under his black sweater. He was prettier by the minute, and I could feel a strange pull in my tummy, one I had never felt before, and I still couldn\u2019t decide if it was a good or a bad feeling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you. My little sister really likes your music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d He asked in amusement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, I like Fireproof.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"That\u2019s a 1D song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still like it.\u201d I shrugged off, feeling elated as his sweet smile spread on his lips, showing off his bunny teeth and the dimples on his cheek. \u201cAnd Woman, I like Woman.\u201d</p><p>The fluttering in my stomach seemed to be growing, and I had to wonder if I was going to explode at any second now. He leaned forward, as if he was ready to tell me some big secret, and bit the corner of his lip as he got ready to say his next words.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do this?\u201d He finally said.\u00a0</p><p>I did. I didn\u2019t. I had no idea.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll work?\u201d My voice didn\u2019t sound like my own. It was laced with doubt and something else that I couldn\u2019t quite describe yet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeople will believe whatever they want.\u201d He shrugged, returning my gesture in an effortless way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026I just, I never seem to know how far I want this to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as you can go without losing yourself.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"How do you know you\u2019re not losing yourself?\u201d I asked in response, looking at him as his expression turned just a little bit darker. For a person so private, his face said too much.</p><p>\u201cYou never really do,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI guess, you have to go with your gut.\u201d</p><p>My gut. My gut was untrusting and anxious, ready to flee at any second. It had done it before, now it was just waiting for a new opportunity to do it again, really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d The words came out of my words even before I had processed. So easy, it almost hid the fact that I was an anxious-ridden mess on the inside. \u201cIf\u2026If you want to.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell if he actually liked my answer. All of the sudden he got serious as if he had just realized what he was getting himself into, and he sighed, standing up from his chair to perch himself on Diana\u2019s desk in front of me. He was towering over me, which made me shift uncomfortably in my seat. When he noticed, he sat up straight, giving me some space to breathe better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it then,\u201d He whispered. There was a tiny hint of disappointment, that grew from my chest and spread to my stomach at the tone of his voice as if this was an irritating chore.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it. You don\u2019t know me after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have time to do that.\u201d He softened a little, looking at me with a small smile as I leaned back on my chair and crossed my arms around my chest in a protective way. \u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p><i>Sam.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boyfriend, no,\u201d He mocked, smirking as my eyes blew wide in embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026uh, I wasn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean a boyfriend. I was, I was asking for a girlfriend, but if you do have a boyfriend, I mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend either.\u201d He finally put an end to my misery. \u201cIt makes things easier.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what he meant and I decided against asking him about it. Instead, I chose to focus on the fact that he was single, which definitely gave me something to dream about. Even if I knew nothing was going to happen. Even if I knew this whole thing was nothing but an inconvenience for him.\u00a0</p><p>That didn\u2019t stop the fluttering in my stomach. Probably nothing would.</p><p>I was about to say something when the door opened, and Diana entered the room with Ben. They were holding a bunch of papers each, which she set over her desk before throwing a triumphant smile at us.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think this is all we need.\u201d She said. \u201cLet\u2019s go through them before you take them to your team. Oh, and there\u2019s a party tonight, I want you both there. We need to set things in motion.\u201d</p><p>After that, there was nothing much to say, or do. Ben and Diana took over the conversation, arranging little details that I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine. It was all a blur, of contracts and NDAs and rules that I was supposed to follow, but couldn\u2019t even remember. By the time they left, my head was spinning and I had to close my eyes tightly to stop myself from getting dizzy.\u00a0</p><p>Diana had about a billion things more to discuss with me, ranging from the interview with James Corden, to new scripts, to the outfits I should wear to drop Cat at school, AKA something that didn\u2019t make me look like a crazy person walking through the streets of L.A. But there was too much in my head already, excitement, fear, numbling anxiety, and I could barely keep up with her, as she continued to check things from her to-do list. It was already 19:30 when was finally done, and I had about 1 hour to get ready for the party Diana wanted me to go.\u00a0</p><p>I was so tired. I just wanted to go home.</p><p>\u201cOk, you can go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Di, can I just\u2026take a raincheck on that party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Harry\u2019s coming to get you at 9:15.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, D\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun, sweets.\u201d She didn\u2019t let me finish. \u201cHe\u2019s sooooo hot, try and behave.\u201d</p><p>He was, that was exactly the problem.\u00a0</p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>What Diana had forgotten to tell me was that Harry was not going to pick me up himself. Rather, his driver showed up to my front door, waiting patiently for me for about 20 more minutes until I was ready.</p><p>I was surprised when we got to the venue, as there were not as many paparazzi as I had thought there would be. Actually, there was none. There was only a couple of people by the door, and they all looked at me with surprised expressions as I walked by them, followed by Harry\u2019s driver.</p><p>It was never a good idea for me to go out. I got hugged and pulled and stared at. But here, everyone was calm, probably used to hanging out with people a lot more famous than me. I sucked in a deep breath, smiling at the people that waved at me and sometimes stopping to greet the people that I actually knew. As a result, it took me around 15 minutes to get to Harry\u2019s group.\u00a0</p><p>He was leaning against the wall, holding a glass in his hand while he listened attentively to the girl that was standing in front of him. She was gorgeous, with her long hair layered in loose curls, and a red tight dress fitted like a glove to her absolutely drool-worthy body. She leaned over as if to tell him a secret, and he cocked his head to the side to allow her to do so. I could hear her flirty giggles, and I stopped where I was, suddenly realizing that I did not belong there.\u00a0</p><p>What was I doing? This wasn\u2019t me.\u00a0</p><p>I turned around before anyone could see me, and started my way back to the door. If I called an uber, I would be at home in around 30 minutes, and maybe Sam would go and watch movies with me. He could even bring his girlfriend! I was used to it.\u00a0</p><p>I stood by the bar, leaning on it as I pulled out my phone from my clutch. I was glad I hadn\u2019t wasted a whole lot of time in my outfit, and that I had decided to wear a pair of black jeans and a t-shirt tucked in, with red heels and a black blazer, that way I didn\u2019t feel so disappointed, or embarrassed for the thousands of situations I had pictured in my head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d I heard someone shout at me, which made me turn around to smile to the bartender.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cN\u2026A shot of tequila, please.\u201d I found myself saying, to the bartender\u2019s pleasure. He winked at me and nodded solemnly as if mine was a great choice of alcohol.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cComing right up!\u201d</p><p>And he was right, as about a second later there was a short glass in front of me, dripping from tequila. He offered me salt and a wedge of lime, and I gladly took them before gulping down the shot. The dry liquor burned my throat on its way down, and I winced at the taste, slamming the glass on the table for him to refill.\u00a0</p><p>But before I could grab the new shot he was offering me, someone else took it. I whirled around, ready to tell someone off, but instead, saw Harry as he tipped the glass and chugged it down, wincing as soon as he had finished. The salt and the lime the bartender had offered me were left unattended on the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, that was mine!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d He said. The bar was a little quieter than the rest of the bar, so I noticed that his voice was a little hoarser than I remembered it from the morning.\u00a0 \u201cSaw you drinking one on my way here. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I could feel we were being watched closely by about a hundred people. I could feel their eyes, burning hole on my back as Harry leaned closer to me. He smelled of alcohol and a little bit of mint, and I struggled to stay still where I was, starting to recognize the signs of the strange feeling that had taken over me in the morning.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was about to leave,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut was offered alcohol, so I ummm\u2026got distracted for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you leaving?\u201d Harry was pulling out his wallet, and before I could do anything about it, he handed the barman his credit card, signaling for two more shots to come.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I saw you back there, with the cute girl! I don\u2019t want to impose, Harry, and you\u2019re definitely gonna score with her, so I just\u2026I can\u2019t mess with that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna score?\u201d He seemed amused by my affirmation, but I still nodded vigorously, taking the new shot I was being offered and downing it. It burned a little more and made my head a little more fuzzy than it was after the first one.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou totally are, and she\u2019s hot,\u201d I said, with my tongue feeling a little heavy as I talked.\u00a0</p><p>Harry smirked like he knew I was right, and the girl was probably a goddess put on earth so we could all feel a little ashamed of ourselves. Kind of a reality check in the body of a breathtaking model.\u00a0</p><p>He took his shot and drank it in one gulp, just like I had done seconds before. He winced, scrunching up his nose and smiling like a little kid as he slammed the glass down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck, you couldn\u2019t choose another drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like tequila,\u201d I shrugged, leaning to him to bump my shoulder against his. I stayed there, close to him as I smelled his faint cologne and the bitter alcohol in his breath. \u201cListen, I\u2019m gonna go. You go get the girl, and we try this another day, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do! That girl was hot as fuck, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna give it to you\u2026\u201d I stopped, growing hotter in embarrassment as I looked at him amused face. \u201cI should shut up.\u201d</p><p>His hands were warm and soft and they made my skin tingle as one of them slid carefully to the back of my neck. I stopped breathing, only able to look at him as he pulled me closer to his chest until his breath was fanning over my skin and I could almost taste the bittersweetness of his lips. I took a deep breath, noticing the little smile that played on his lips before he pressed our lips together.\u00a0</p><p>The kiss wasn\u2019t soft, nor was it rough either. It was uncertain and eager as if we wanted to learn as much about each other as we possibly could. His fingers curled around my neck, as he brought me closer to him, and one of my hands tangled in the soft hairs that rested on the nape of his neck. He tasted like peppermint and tequila, and a sweetness I could not describe. My lips parted slightly, and I sighed into the kiss as he took command of it. Our lips were made for each other, of that I was sure, and I allowed myself to mold to him, while time around us stopped and rushed by at the same time. I leaned to him when he broke the kiss apart, looking for the warmth of his body even though he was right next by my side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cameras pointing at us.\u201d He whispered while his fingertips brushed down my neck, keeping me still close to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, dissipating the heaviness that had set in my tummy at his words. \u201cAnd I really wanted to kiss you since this morning. You should stay.\u201d\u201c</p><p>\"Ask me really nicely, I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I whispered, almost against his lips, already dreaming about the taste of them.\u00a0</p><p>He was definitely trouble.\u00a0</p></p>",

I wasn\u2019t used to it, not to the rushing heart that was thumping in my chest, or to the hollow pit in my stomach that made it difficult to breathe. I wasn\u2019t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.\u00a0</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, am I boring you?\u201d</p><p>Funny enough, that\u2019s never a concerned question. It\u2019s always asked with certain annoyance and in a stern tone that commands attention, almost as if the person asking didn\u2019t really care about the status of your entertainment.</p><p>I looked up at her, her piercing and steely blue eyes staring at me while her red nails drummed on the table impatiently. She was wearing a black dress, without a jacket, as the sunny day in L.A. was hot enough to make you feel like going to the beach and having a couple of beers. Could you even swim in L.A.? Maybe in Corona del Mar, certainly not in Santa Monica. Never by the pier. Jesus, I was bored.\u00a0</p><p>But even then, the thought of answering sincerely didn\u2019t really cross my mind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I smiled meekly at Midge, hoping the gesture would calm her down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get much sleep last night. What were you saying?\u201d</p><p>And oh, she didn\u2019t buy my excuse, never really did. Her eyes rolled back, just a little bit, enough to let me know she thought I was a fucking pest, but that still, she was a professional. Without saying a word, she went back to look through the magazine on her Ipad, flipping the page to stare carefully at the page-wide photo. I looked at it and felt that familiar pang of anxiety, the certainty that I was way in over my head. That someday, somehow, this dream or nightmare was going to end, and I was going to wake up back home, clad in sweat, to go back to wait tables at the dinner. Go back to fighting for a way out.\u00a0</p><p>Midge kept staring at the photo, with a clinical eye that only years and years of experience could grant. I wondered if she thought the same as I did; if the person staring back from the glossy page of the Vogue magazine was as much of a stranger to her as she was to me. Sure, she had my lips, red and pillowy from the makeup, and her hair looked as disheveled in the long braid as mine usually did, but still, she wasn\u2019t me. She couldn\u2019t be. She looked powerful and peaceful, two feelings I wasn\u2019t too familiar with, as she sat on a huge red velvet throne with her feet hanging in the air. Her hand was resting awkwardly above her head, and the dress, beautiful as it was, with its gauze and its pearls and its flowers, wasn\u2019t the most striking part of the picture, but her eyes. They were fierce and piercing and demanded to be looked at.\u00a0<br></p><p>She wanted to be seen. She demanded it. She was in Vogue and wanted everyone to know there was a new star in town.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is a nice picture.\u201d Midge pointed at it. \u201cNice work.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I replied, scrambling to look away from her as soon as she went back to inspect the rest of the magazine.\u00a0<br></p><p>Midge\u2019s office was almost as impressive as she was. Her main wall was covered with photos of her clients, with people wearing their finest clothes and posing as if it was nothing; like their lives were normal and the rest of us just needed to catch up. There was Sandra Bullock in InStyle Magazine, Jennifer Lawrence on Time, and Taylor Swift on Elle. A picture of Midge and Elle and Dakota Fanning in some party was right in the middle of the mix, and I gulped, wondering when would she finally tell me to fuck off. She didn\u2019t need me. She would do just fine after I disappeared into thin air.\u00a0<br></p><p>And I needed her so badly.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>I looked back at her to inspect her further, even when I had done that thousands of times before. She was wearing a simple black drape tunic that fell a little above her knees, and a pair of Alexander Mcqueen\u2019s sandals, with a leather bow around her ankle.\u00a0 Everything about her screamed boss, and I was adequately scared of her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe need more photos,\u201d She said, without raising her voice, which made me think she wasn\u2019t even talking to me. \u201cWe want you everywhere during award season.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI will make sure I am seen everywhere,\u201d I offered, but I was received with a dismissing wave of her hand, right before she got up to serve herself some water, or at least what I hoped was water.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll take care of it. I have\u2026something in the works already.\u201d She turned, offering me an odd smile that made me shift on my chair. I picked up an ambiguity in her tone, like even that tiny bit of information was already saying too much, and I gulped nervously, looking at her as she walked calmly back to her chair. I debated whether I should ask her about it, or just nod, to put myself on her bad side or just let her do her job. On one side, she was fucking good at it and I thanked all of my stars to have her. On the other side, \u201csomething in the works\u201d is never enough information, much less when you\u2019re the one on the receiving end.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMidge, can I ask\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, honey.\u201d She smiled condescendingly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s all ready. Until then, let\u2019s focus on getting you as many nominations as we can. We\u2019re going after an Oscar, let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d<br></p><p>The Oscar, the only thing being talked about around me even before the movie came out. If anything, I was incredibly happy I had the chance to play make-believe, dress fancy and run around talking with a British accent. To work along well-established actors, and to have their grace and support, it was more than I ever expected. Much more than I could ever dream of.\u00a0<br></p><p>Also, my performance had been buzzed about before, raved between critics and peers, and not even that had gotten me a nomination.\u00a0<br></p><p>Even a sliver of hope seemed too risky at this point. And I knew it, knew the heartache that was coming my way if I wasn\u2019t on the list of nominees. But even then, I couldn\u2019t help it, couldn\u2019t help but wish for it, imagine myself crying as I hugged my mother when they called for my name, and the words I would say as I held the golden bald man in my trembling hand: \u201cThank you, God. Thanks, mom\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDo you think I can get it? That I can get an award?\u201d I asked her, holding my breath as I waited for her answer. Maybe she had picked up the doubt in my voice, or the fact that it quivered a little at the end. I felt small, almost expecting a laugh and a resounding no, but Midge smiled instead, turning to look at me with a soft expression I didn\u2019t know she was capable of.<br></p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re incredibly talented, honey. I wouldn\u2019t be representing you if you weren\u2019t.\u201d She said. \u201cI think you can get it, and that you deserve it, and I\u2019m just gonna push you in the right direction, so I need you to trust me, yes?\u201d<br></p><p>Anything she wanted, everything she needed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\"\u00a0<br></p><p>Well, not everything.\u00a0<br></p><p>Or maybe yes.\u00a0<br></p><p>I still hadn\u2019t decided.\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>The meeting went on for about 15 more minutes, during which, Midge seemed to grow more distracted until she finally dismissed me. I tried not to jump up from the chair and run out of that office but left pretty quickly anyway, rushing through the corridors jammed with cubicles, and trying to ignore the head peeking out of the white cardboard separators.<br></p><p>The rush of a dream, a grand one, was making my heart beat faster, and my smile grow bigger as I head to the lobby. I tried to calm myself down, to not give in to the fantasy, but my mind kept rushing with the images of the balls, and the dresses, and how beautiful the statuettes would look in my living room.<br></p><p>\"Hey!\u201d<br></p><p>My heart came to a sudden stop, as I turned around to see him. He was sitting on the black couch in front of the receptionist counter, and was looking at me with a mix of bewilderment and amusement. Sam was wearing all black, and his curly hair was starting to get too long to behave, so it just flopped on his forehead. I smiled at him as he started to get up and let him take my bag out of my hands for him to carry.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait for me, y'know?<br></p><p>\"Well, you promised sushi.\u201d He shrugged off, smiling widely as I bumped my shoulder against his in protest.<br></p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s get sushi,\u201d I agreed, following behind him as he started to make his way out of the building. The day was incredibly shiny, and the air was crispy and I felt giddy, walking to his car as if I was on a cloud.<br></p><p>Sam had this thing about him, something that made everything easier when he was next to me. His smile could light up a room, like a burden had lifted off my shoulders, and his company made me feel safe, maybe from how many times he had saved me before.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo, how did it go with Midge?\u201d He asked while he got ready to turn on the engine to leave. He pronounced her name with an edge, just like he did since she had asked us to keep our friendship from the public eye. We appreciate your privacy, Sam. Hanging out so much will only get you trouble.<br></p><p>But Sam only saw me as his friend. I should know, I wish he didn\u2019t.<br></p><p>\u201cIt went well, she said she has something in the works for me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike what?<br></p><p>\"I don\u2019t know\u2026I\u2019m a bit scared if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you should be,\u201d He said. Sam was considering his next words, I could see by the way his eyebrows scrunched up right in the middle, and by the chewing of his bottom lip. He looked at me, with his big hazel eyes, and his mouth twitched a little. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to be a teacher? It seems easier\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAn actress, Sam,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll make enough money, so we\u2019ll never have to go back.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t ever have to go back. I\u2019ll never let you.\u201d<br></p><p>I believed him. I could still remember the smell of his drenched jacket when he started his car before we drove away.\u00a0<br></p><p>\"I know,\u201d I replied simply. \u201cBut, it\u2019s also fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\"\u00a0<br></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><h2><b>- Info you need to know -</b></h2><p><b>Name of the show</b>: The Late Late Show with James Corden.</p><p><b>Host</b>: James Kimberley Corden (Do not call him Kimberley).\u00a0</p><p><b>Time slot</b>: 12:37am/11:37pm c</p><p><b>Banned subjects</b>: Kardashians/Kanye; Trump; how much you hated \u2018Love Actually\u2019; how Grey\u2019s Anatomy needs to end.\u00a0</p><p><b>Encouraged conversations</b>: Your movie (the Oscar one, not The Kissing List), your love life (we\u2019ll feed you cues), how hot you think Rihanna is.

I didn\u2019t know what it was about, or why it had to be so early in the morning, all I knew was that I was late and that she was probably going to chew my head off.\u00a0</p><p>By the time I got to her office, it was already 8:35, and I was sweaty and panting, breathless from running the flights of stairs to the 8th floor, as it was almost impossible to get into an elevator at that hour. A light layer of sweat was forming over my forehead, and the fishtail braid I had begged my little sister to do was falling apart. It wasn\u2019t my best look, but there was nothing I could do about it.\u00a0</p><p><i>Hi, Diana, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m late. Cat missed the school bus and I had to take her. Yes, I know, you don\u2019t care\u2026</i></p><p>I expected to find Diana fuming, with her arms crossed on her chest and a carefully threaded eyebrow raised almost to her scalp. I expected her to be so angry at my tardiness, that she refused to see me for an hour or two, even if there was nothing else on her calendar, just to teach me a lesson. I was ready for it, actually.\u00a0</p><p>So, when I pushed the door open, and I found her laughing, it was almost disappointing.</p><p>The chirpy blonde (Midge\u2019s second best agent!!!) did not notice my arrival, nor did the two guys that were chatting with her. It wasn\u2019t until I closed the door behind me that they turned to look at me. The conversation died down, and an awkward silence took over the room while everyone\u2019s eyes fell on me.\u00a0</p><p>The guy to the right was about D\u2019s age, 34 or 35 years old, tall and handsome. He was wearing a simple gray peacoat and a pair of black jeans and was holding a bunch of papers in his hands. He nodded, almost in recognition, and I offered him a small smile in return.</p><p>The guy to the left, well, I recognized him. It would be almost impossible not to.\u00a0</p><p>\"Hi,\u201d I heard myself mumble, looking at him as he stared back at me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Harry,\u201d He said as his lips twitched into half a smile. I noticed that he was wearing a black knit sweater, and was trying to jam his fingers into the pocket of his black jeans, however, the heavy looking rings on his fingers didn\u2019t allow him to do so.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, I know,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Whatever was happening, I could only describe it as an out-of-body experience, almost as if I were looking at myself from the other side of the room, mocking me for my own awkwardness.\u00a0</p><p>Or maybe I was just starstruck.\u00a0</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look away from him. His lopsided smile grew bigger,\u00a0 and he cocked his head slightly to the side, staring at me as if there was nothing else that could possibly interest him in that room. A new feeling, the small, warm flutter that started at the pit of my stomach, maybe it was just my heart that was starting to race in my chest.\u00a0</p><p>Time had stopped, it had to, as there was no way I had spent so much time looking at him, and standing awkwardly in the middle of a room, while other two people witnessed my stupidity. I wasn\u2019t used to it, not to the rushing heart that was thumping in my chest, or to the hollow pit in my stomach that made it difficult to breathe. I wasn\u2019t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Diana was looking at us, her green eyes dancing from one to the other while a coy smile started to form on her lips. \u201cCan we continue?\u201d</p><p>She was mocking me, of that I was certain. Her eyes followed me until I took a seat next to the other guy, whose name I had totally missed, and smirked when I finally looked at her. My cheeks felt hot, and my heart seemed to barely be recovering from a marathon.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk,\u201d She continued, recovering her serious face as she turned to face us all. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: We have an offer to make, which we think might benefit all of us. Our client is an up-and-coming Hollywood star, and as you may, or may not, know, we\u2019re pushing for her to be an Oscar nominee this award season. We almost have the Golden Globes nomination in the bag, and we\u2019re being as careful as possible with her overall image and fame.\u201d</p><p>I almost felt like I wasn\u2019t in the room, as if Diana wasn\u2019t talking about me. It was all too clinical, too impersonal, and I felt far away from it. I peered to my side and saw the guy next to me shifting awkwardly in his seat, just like if he knew what was coming, and regretted it deeply. As if he was waiting for a train to crash, and all he could do was stand there and let it happen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe movie she was in was very particular.\u201d Diana smiled, looking at me for the first time since she started. \u201cAnd she was wonderful in it. We\u2019re certain she\u2019ll have no problem creating buzz for herself, but\u2026we\u2019d like to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp how?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBen, would you like to continue?\u201d</p><p>The guy next to me, whose name was Ben, didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to continue. He didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to be there actually, but he stood up and leaned against Diana\u2019s desk to look at us.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d He started. \u201cI owe Midge a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring.\u201d I heard Harry mock under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWe want to spread a rumor, and not deny it, about you two.\u201d He ignored Harry, and looked at me, as if I was an easier audience that would understand what was wanted of me. \u201cWe want you to hang out, and act like a couple, a romantic one.\u201d But the fact that I wasn\u2019t protesting, or even talking, was not because I agreed with whatever he was saying, but rather, because I had no fucking idea of what was happening. Instead, I just stared at him dumbfounded. \u201cWe think it might give you an edge. Your movie is about to hit theaters, and it might push people to go and check it out, just to see who\u2019s that girl Harry\u2019s dating. That and the buzz you already got during the festivals\u2019 screenings, you might have a great chance next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso,\u201d Diana interjected. \u201cIt might tip the balance in your favor in the Josh and Hazel\u2019s Guide to not Dating\u2019s casting. People don\u2019t really see you as a romantic lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, for you, Harry.\u201d Ben was rather cautious as he continued. \u201cWe think it might give you exposure to a broader audience, and\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need exposure,\u201d Harry shook his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou do. You\u2019re nothing without it, and that\u2019s exactly what you don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Diana explained in a rather cold tone. More like the Diana I knew and feared. \u201cWe also think you\u2019ll be a really good Josh. If this all works out, who knows, maybe you\u2019ll even lead the movie. That\u2019s something people would love to see.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, despite the fact that there was a deep set frown in his forehead, and that his face was not very friendly at that very moment. I still couldn\u2019t quite shake the feeling that this was happening to someone else, not to me. It couldn\u2019t be happening to me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you two talk, I\u2019m gonna get the papers ready,\u201d she said, taking Ben\u2019s hand to pull him out of the room to leave us alone.</p><p>\u201cI can act romantic,\u201d I mumbled as soon as she closed the door.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I let my hand ran through my hair before looking at him. He was already staring at me, with that same intensity as when I first entered the room. He looked tired, and his eyes were puffy like he had barely gotten any sleep the night before. He switched on his seat until he was fully facing me, with his feet dangling from the arm-chair while he leaned back to the wall to make himself comfortable. The colorful planets on his black sweater made me smile, and before I could blush under his gaze, I looked down to my lap, not uttering a word as I felt his eyes on me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like your movies.\u201d I heard him say.\u00a0</p><p>My eyes rose to his, which was definitely a mistake. It was easier not to look at him, not to see the way his pink mouth twitched when he was deep in thought and the anchor tattoo that was peeking under his black sweater. He was prettier by the minute, and I could feel a strange pull in my tummy, one I had never felt before, and I still couldn\u2019t decide if it was a good or a bad feeling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you. My little sister really likes your music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d He asked in amusement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, I like Fireproof.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"That\u2019s a 1D song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still like it.\u201d I shrugged off, feeling elated as his sweet smile spread on his lips, showing off his bunny teeth and the dimples on his cheek. \u201cAnd Woman, I like Woman.\u201d</p><p>The fluttering in my stomach seemed to be growing, and I had to wonder if I was going to explode at any second now. He leaned forward, as if he was ready to tell me some big secret, and bit the corner of his lip as he got ready to say his next words.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do this?\u201d He finally said.\u00a0</p><p>I did. I didn\u2019t. I had no idea.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll work?\u201d My voice didn\u2019t sound like my own. It was laced with doubt and something else that I couldn\u2019t quite describe yet.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeople will believe whatever they want.\u201d He shrugged, returning my gesture in an effortless way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026I just, I never seem to know how far I want this to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as you can go without losing yourself.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"How do you know you\u2019re not losing yourself?\u201d I asked in response, looking at him as his expression turned just a little bit darker. For a person so private, his face said too much.</p><p>\u201cYou never really do,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI guess, you have to go with your gut.\u201d</p><p>My gut. My gut was untrusting and anxious, ready to flee at any second. It had done it before, now it was just waiting for a new opportunity to do it again, really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d The words came out of my words even before I had processed. So easy, it almost hid the fact that I was an anxious-ridden mess on the inside. \u201cIf\u2026If you want to.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell if he actually liked my answer. All of the sudden he got serious as if he had just realized what he was getting himself into, and he sighed, standing up from his chair to perch himself on Diana\u2019s desk in front of me. He was towering over me, which made me shift uncomfortably in my seat. When he noticed, he sat up straight, giving me some space to breathe better.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it then,\u201d He whispered. There was a tiny hint of disappointment, that grew from my chest and spread to my stomach at the tone of his voice as if this was an irritating chore.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it. You don\u2019t know me after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have time to do that.\u201d He softened a little, looking at me with a small smile as I leaned back on my chair and crossed my arms around my chest in a protective way. \u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p><i>Sam.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boyfriend, no,\u201d He mocked, smirking as my eyes blew wide in embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026uh, I wasn\u2019t\u2026I didn\u2019t mean a boyfriend. I was, I was asking for a girlfriend, but if you do have a boyfriend, I mean\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend either.\u201d He finally put an end to my misery. \u201cIt makes things easier.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what he meant and I decided against asking him about it. Instead, I chose to focus on the fact that he was single, which definitely gave me something to dream about. Even if I knew nothing was going to happen. Even if I knew this whole thing was nothing but an inconvenience for him.\u00a0</p><p>That didn\u2019t stop the fluttering in my stomach. Probably nothing would.</p><p>I was about to say something when the door opened, and Diana entered the room with Ben. They were holding a bunch of papers each, which she set over her desk before throwing a triumphant smile at us.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think this is all we need.\u201d She said. \u201cLet\u2019s go through them before you take them to your team. Oh, and there\u2019s a party tonight, I want you both there. We need to set things in motion.\u201d</p><p>After that, there was nothing much to say, or do. Ben and Diana took over the conversation, arranging little details that I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine. It was all a blur, of contracts and NDAs and rules that I was supposed to follow, but couldn\u2019t even remember. By the time they left, my head was spinning and I had to close my eyes tightly to stop myself from getting dizzy.\u00a0</p><p>Diana had about a billion things more to discuss with me, ranging from the interview with James Corden, to new scripts, to the outfits I should wear to drop Cat at school, AKA something that didn\u2019t make me look like a crazy person walking through the streets of L.A. But there was too much in my head already, excitement, fear, numbling anxiety, and I could barely keep up with her, as she continued to check things from her to-do list. It was already 19:30 when was finally done, and I had about 1 hour to get ready for the party Diana wanted me to go.\u00a0</p><p>I was so tired. I just wanted to go home.</p><p>\u201cOk, you can go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Di, can I just\u2026take a raincheck on that party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Harry\u2019s coming to get you at 9:15.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, D\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun, sweets.\u201d She didn\u2019t let me finish. \u201cHe\u2019s sooooo hot, try and behave.\u201d</p><p>He was, that was exactly the problem.\u00a0</p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>What Diana had forgotten to tell me was that Harry was not going to pick me up himself. Rather, his driver showed up to my front door, waiting patiently for me for about 20 more minutes until I was ready.</p><p>I was surprised when we got to the venue, as there were not as many paparazzi as I had thought there would be. Actually, there was none. There was only a couple of people by the door, and they all looked at me with surprised expressions as I walked by them, followed by Harry\u2019s driver.</p><p>It was never a good idea for me to go out. I got hugged and pulled and stared at. But here, everyone was calm, probably used to hanging out with people a lot more famous than me. I sucked in a deep breath, smiling at the people that waved at me and sometimes stopping to greet the people that I actually knew. As a result, it took me around 15 minutes to get to Harry\u2019s group.\u00a0</p><p>He was leaning against the wall, holding a glass in his hand while he listened attentively to the girl that was standing in front of him. She was gorgeous, with her long hair layered in loose curls, and a red tight dress fitted like a glove to her absolutely drool-worthy body. She leaned over as if to tell him a secret, and he cocked his head to the side to allow her to do so. I could hear her flirty giggles, and I stopped where I was, suddenly realizing that I did not belong there.\u00a0</p><p>What was I doing? This wasn\u2019t me.\u00a0</p><p>I turned around before anyone could see me, and started my way back to the door. If I called an uber, I would be at home in around 30 minutes, and maybe Sam would go and watch movies with me. He could even bring his girlfriend! I was used to it.\u00a0</p><p>I stood by the bar, leaning on it as I pulled out my phone from my clutch. I was glad I hadn\u2019t wasted a whole lot of time in my outfit, and that I had decided to wear a pair of black jeans and a t-shirt tucked in, with red heels and a black blazer, that way I didn\u2019t feel so disappointed, or embarrassed for the thousands of situations I had pictured in my head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d I heard someone shout at me, which made me turn around to smile to the bartender.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cN\u2026A shot of tequila, please.\u201d I found myself saying, to the bartender\u2019s pleasure. He winked at me and nodded solemnly as if mine was a great choice of alcohol.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cComing right up!\u201d</p><p>And he was right, as about a second later there was a short glass in front of me, dripping from tequila. He offered me salt and a wedge of lime, and I gladly took them before gulping down the shot. The dry liquor burned my throat on its way down, and I winced at the taste, slamming the glass on the table for him to refill.\u00a0</p><p>But before I could grab the new shot he was offering me, someone else took it. I whirled around, ready to tell someone off, but instead, saw Harry as he tipped the glass and chugged it down, wincing as soon as he had finished. The salt and the lime the bartender had offered me were left unattended on the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, that was mine!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d He said. The bar was a little quieter than the rest of the bar, so I noticed that his voice was a little hoarser than I remembered it from the morning.\u00a0 \u201cSaw you drinking one on my way here. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I could feel we were being watched closely by about a hundred people. I could feel their eyes, burning hole on my back as Harry leaned closer to me. He smelled of alcohol and a little bit of mint, and I struggled to stay still where I was, starting to recognize the signs of the strange feeling that had taken over me in the morning.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was about to leave,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut was offered alcohol, so I ummm\u2026got distracted for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you leaving?\u201d Harry was pulling out his wallet, and before I could do anything about it, he handed the barman his credit card, signaling for two more shots to come.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I saw you back there, with the cute girl! I don\u2019t want to impose, Harry, and you\u2019re definitely gonna score with her, so I just\u2026I can\u2019t mess with that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna score?\u201d He seemed amused by my affirmation, but I still nodded vigorously, taking the new shot I was being offered and downing it. It burned a little more and made my head a little more fuzzy than it was after the first one.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou totally are, and she\u2019s hot,\u201d I said, with my tongue feeling a little heavy as I talked.\u00a0</p><p>Harry smirked like he knew I was right, and the girl was probably a goddess put on earth so we could all feel a little ashamed of ourselves. Kind of a reality check in the body of a breathtaking model.\u00a0</p><p>He took his shot and drank it in one gulp, just like I had done seconds before. He winced, scrunching up his nose and smiling like a little kid as he slammed the glass down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck, you couldn\u2019t choose another drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like tequila,\u201d I shrugged, leaning to him to bump my shoulder against his. I stayed there, close to him as I smelled his faint cologne and the bitter alcohol in his breath. \u201cListen, I\u2019m gonna go. You go get the girl, and we try this another day, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do! That girl was hot as fuck, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna give it to you\u2026\u201d I stopped, growing hotter in embarrassment as I looked at him amused face. \u201cI should shut up.\u201d</p><p>His hands were warm and soft and they made my skin tingle as one of them slid carefully to the back of my neck. I stopped breathing, only able to look at him as he pulled me closer to his chest until his breath was fanning over my skin and I could almost taste the bittersweetness of his lips. I took a deep breath, noticing the little smile that played on his lips before he pressed our lips together.\u00a0</p><p>The kiss wasn\u2019t soft, nor was it rough either. It was uncertain and eager as if we wanted to learn as much about each other as we possibly could. His fingers curled around my neck, as he brought me closer to him, and one of my hands tangled in the soft hairs that rested on the nape of his neck. He tasted like peppermint and tequila, and a sweetness I could not describe. My lips parted slightly, and I sighed into the kiss as he took command of it. Our lips were made for each other, of that I was sure, and I allowed myself to mold to him, while time around us stopped and rushed by at the same time. I leaned to him when he broke the kiss apart, looking for the warmth of his body even though he was right next by my side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cameras pointing at us.\u201d He whispered while his fingertips brushed down my neck, keeping me still close to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, dissipating the heaviness that had set in my tummy at his words. \u201cAnd I really wanted to kiss you since this morning. You should stay.\u201d\u201c</p><p>\"Ask me really nicely, I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I whispered, almost against his lips, already dreaming about the taste of them.\u00a0</p><p>He was definitely trouble.\u00a0</p></p>",

His lopsided smile grew bigger, &nbsp;and he cocked his head slightly to the side, staring at me as if there was nothing else that could possibly interest him in that room. A new feeling, the small, warm flutter that started at the pit of my stomach, maybe it was just my heart that was starting to race in my chest.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Time had stopped, it had to, as there was no way I had spent so much time looking at him, and standing awkwardly in the middle of a room, while other two people witnessed my stupidity. I wasn&rsquo;t used to it, not to the rushing heart that was thumping in my chest, or to the hollow pit in my stomach that made it difficult to breathe. I wasn&rsquo;t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, am I boring you?&rdquo;</p><p>Funny enough, that&rsquo;s never a concerned question. It&rsquo;s always asked with certain annoyance and in a stern tone that commands attention, almost as if the person asking didn&rsquo;t really care about the status of your entertainment.</p><p>I looked up at her, her piercing and steely blue eyes staring at me while her red nails drummed on the table impatiently. She was wearing a black dress, without a jacket, as the sunny day in L.A. was hot enough to make you feel like going to the beach and having a couple of beers. Could you even swim in L.A.? Maybe in Corona del Mar, certainly not in Santa Monica. Never by the pier. Jesus, I was bored.&nbsp;</p><p>But even then, the thought of answering sincerely didn&rsquo;t really cross my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I smiled meekly at Midge, hoping the gesture would calm her down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t get much sleep last night. What were you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>And oh, she didn&rsquo;t buy my excuse, never really did. Her eyes rolled back, just a little bit, enough to let me know she thought I was a fucking pest, but that still, she was a professional. Without saying a word, she went back to look through the magazine on her Ipad, flipping the page to stare carefully at the page-wide photo. I looked at it and felt that familiar pang of anxiety, the certainty that I was way in over my head. That someday, somehow, this dream or nightmare was going to end, and I was going to wake up back home, clad in sweat, to go back to wait tables at the dinner. Go back to fighting for a way out.&nbsp;</p><p>Midge kept staring at the photo, with a clinical eye that only years and years of experience could grant. I wondered if she thought the same as I did; if the person staring back from the glossy page of the Vogue magazine was as much of a stranger to her as she was to me. Sure, she had my lips, red and pillowy from the makeup, and her hair looked as disheveled in the long braid as mine usually did, but still, she wasn&rsquo;t me. She couldn&rsquo;t be. She looked powerful and peaceful, two feelings I wasn&rsquo;t too familiar with, as she sat on a huge red velvet throne with her feet hanging in the air. Her hand was resting awkwardly above her head, and the dress, beautiful as it was, with its gauze and its pearls and its flowers, wasn&rsquo;t the most striking part of the picture, but her eyes. They were fierce and piercing and demanded to be looked at.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>She wanted to be seen. She demanded it. She was in Vogue and wanted everyone to know there was a new star in town.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This is a nice picture.&rdquo; Midge pointed at it. &ldquo;Nice work.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I replied, scrambling to look away from her as soon as she went back to inspect the rest of the magazine.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Midge&rsquo;s office was almost as impressive as she was. Her main wall was covered with photos of her clients, with people wearing their finest clothes and posing as if it was nothing; like their lives were normal and the rest of us just needed to catch up. There was Sandra Bullock in InStyle Magazine, Jennifer Lawrence on Time, and Taylor Swift on Elle. A picture of Midge and Elle and Dakota Fanning in some party was right in the middle of the mix, and I gulped, wondering when would she finally tell me to fuck off. She didn&rsquo;t need me. She would do just fine after I disappeared into thin air.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>And I needed her so badly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>I looked back at her to inspect her further, even when I had done that thousands of times before. She was wearing a simple black drape tunic that fell a little above her knees, and a pair of Alexander Mcqueen&rsquo;s sandals, with a leather bow around her ankle.&nbsp; Everything about her screamed boss, and I was adequately scared of her.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We need more photos,&rdquo; She said, without raising her voice, which made me think she wasn&rsquo;t even talking to me. &ldquo;We want you everywhere during award season.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I will make sure I am seen everywhere,&rdquo; I offered, but I was received with a dismissing wave of her hand, right before she got up to serve herself some water, or at least what I hoped was water.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll take care of it. I have&hellip;something in the works already.&rdquo; She turned, offering me an odd smile that made me shift on my chair. I picked up an ambiguity in her tone, like even that tiny bit of information was already saying too much, and I gulped nervously, looking at her as she walked calmly back to her chair. I debated whether I should ask her about it, or just nod, to put myself on her bad side or just let her do her job. On one side, she was fucking good at it and I thanked all of my stars to have her. On the other side, &ldquo;something in the works&rdquo; is never enough information, much less when you&rsquo;re the one on the receiving end.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Midge, can I ask&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, honey.&rdquo; She smiled condescendingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when it&rsquo;s all ready. Until then, let&rsquo;s focus on getting you as many nominations as we can. We&rsquo;re going after an Oscar, let&rsquo;s not forget that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The Oscar, the only thing being talked about around me even before the movie came out. If anything, I was incredibly happy I had the chance to play make-believe, dress fancy and run around talking with a British accent. To work along well-established actors, and to have their grace and support, it was more than I ever expected. Much more than I could ever dream of.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Also, my performance had been buzzed about before, raved between critics and peers, and not even that had gotten me a nomination.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Even a sliver of hope seemed too risky at this point. And I knew it, knew the heartache that was coming my way if I wasn&rsquo;t on the list of nominees. But even then, I couldn&rsquo;t help it, couldn&rsquo;t help but wish for it, imagine myself crying as I hugged my mother when they called for my name, and the words I would say as I held the golden bald man in my trembling hand: &ldquo;Thank you, God. Thanks, mom&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you think I can get it? That I can get an award?&rdquo; I asked her, holding my breath as I waited for her answer. Maybe she had picked up the doubt in my voice, or the fact that it quivered a little at the end. I felt small, almost expecting a laugh and a resounding no, but Midge smiled instead, turning to look at me with a soft expression I didn&rsquo;t know she was capable of.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re incredibly talented, honey. I wouldn&rsquo;t be representing you if you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;I think you can get it, and that you deserve it, and I&rsquo;m just gonna push you in the right direction, so I need you to trust me, yes?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Anything she wanted, everything she needed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.\"&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Well, not everything.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Or maybe yes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>I still hadn&rsquo;t decided.&nbsp;<br /></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>The meeting went on for about 15 more minutes, during which, Midge seemed to grow more distracted until she finally dismissed me. I tried not to jump up from the chair and run out of that office but left pretty quickly anyway, rushing through the corridors jammed with cubicles, and trying to ignore the head peeking out of the white cardboard separators.<br /></p><p>The rush of a dream, a grand one, was making my heart beat faster, and my smile grow bigger as I head to the lobby. I tried to calm myself down, to not give in to the fantasy, but my mind kept rushing with the images of the balls, and the dresses, and how beautiful the statuettes would look in my living room.<br /></p><p>\"Hey!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>My heart came to a sudden stop, as I turned around to see him. He was sitting on the black couch in front of the receptionist counter, and was looking at me with a mix of bewilderment and amusement. Sam was wearing all black, and his curly hair was starting to get too long to behave, so it just flopped on his forehead. I smiled at him as he started to get up and let him take my bag out of my hands for him to carry.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to wait for me, y'know?<br /></p><p>\"Well, you promised sushi.&rdquo; He shrugged off, smiling widely as I bumped my shoulder against his in protest.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, let&rsquo;s get sushi,&rdquo; I agreed, following behind him as he started to make his way out of the building. The day was incredibly shiny, and the air was crispy and I felt giddy, walking to his car as if I was on a cloud.<br /></p><p>Sam had this thing about him, something that made everything easier when he was next to me. His smile could light up a room, like a burden had lifted off my shoulders, and his company made me feel safe, maybe from how many times he had saved me before.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, how did it go with Midge?&rdquo; He asked while he got ready to turn on the engine to leave. He pronounced her name with an edge, just like he did since she had asked us to keep our friendship from the public eye. We appreciate your privacy, Sam. Hanging out so much will only get you trouble.<br /></p><p>But Sam only saw me as his friend. I should know, I wish he didn&rsquo;t.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It went well, she said she has something in the works for me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like what?<br /></p><p>\"I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;I&rsquo;m a bit scared if I&rsquo;m being honest.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, you should be,&rdquo; He said. Sam was considering his next words, I could see by the way his eyebrows scrunched up right in the middle, and by the chewing of his bottom lip. He looked at me, with his big hazel eyes, and his mouth twitched a little. &ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to be a teacher? It seems easier&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;An actress, Sam,&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make enough money, so we&rsquo;ll never have to go back.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t ever have to go back. I&rsquo;ll never let you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>I believed him. I could still remember the smell of his drenched jacket when he started his car before we drove away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>\"I know,&rdquo; I replied simply. &ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s also fun, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you say so.\"&nbsp;<br /></p><h2><b>***</b></h2><h2><b>- Info you need to know -</b></h2><p><b>Name of the show</b>: The Late Late Show with James Corden.</p><p><b>Host</b>: James Kimberley Corden (Do not call him Kimberley).&nbsp;</p><p><b>Time slot</b>: 12:37am/11:37pm c</p><p><b>Banned subjects</b>: Kardashians/Kanye; Trump; how much you hated &lsquo;Love Actually&rsquo;; how Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy needs to end.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Encouraged conversations</b>: Your movie (the Oscar one, not The Kissing List), your love life (we&rsquo;ll feed you cues), how hot you think Rihanna is.

I didn&rsquo;t know what it was about, or why it had to be so early in the morning, all I knew was that I was late and that she was probably going to chew my head off.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time I got to her office, it was already 8:35, and I was sweaty and panting, breathless from running the flights of stairs to the 8th floor, as it was almost impossible to get into an elevator at that hour. A light layer of sweat was forming over my forehead, and the fishtail braid I had begged my little sister to do was falling apart. It wasn&rsquo;t my best look, but there was nothing I could do about it.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Hi, Diana, I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;m late. Cat missed the school bus and I had to take her. Yes, I know, you don&rsquo;t care&hellip;</i></p><p>I expected to find Diana fuming, with her arms crossed on her chest and a carefully threaded eyebrow raised almost to her scalp. I expected her to be so angry at my tardiness, that she refused to see me for an hour or two, even if there was nothing else on her calendar, just to teach me a lesson. I was ready for it, actually.&nbsp;</p><p>So, when I pushed the door open, and I found her laughing, it was almost disappointing.</p><p>The chirpy blonde (Midge&rsquo;s second best agent!!!) did not notice my arrival, nor did the two guys that were chatting with her. It wasn&rsquo;t until I closed the door behind me that they turned to look at me. The conversation died down, and an awkward silence took over the room while everyone&rsquo;s eyes fell on me.&nbsp;</p><p>The guy to the right was about D&rsquo;s age, 34 or 35 years old, tall and handsome. He was wearing a simple gray peacoat and a pair of black jeans and was holding a bunch of papers in his hands. He nodded, almost in recognition, and I offered him a small smile in return.</p><p>The guy to the left, well, I recognized him. It would be almost impossible not to.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Hi,&rdquo; I heard myself mumble, looking at him as he stared back at me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Harry,&rdquo; He said as his lips twitched into half a smile. I noticed that he was wearing a black knit sweater, and was trying to jam his fingers into the pocket of his black jeans, however, the heavy looking rings on his fingers didn&rsquo;t allow him to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I, I know,&rdquo; I replied.</p><p>Whatever was happening, I could only describe it as an out-of-body experience, almost as if I were looking at myself from the other side of the room, mocking me for my own awkwardness.&nbsp;</p><p>Or maybe I was just starstruck.&nbsp;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t look away from him. His lopsided smile grew bigger,&nbsp; and he cocked his head slightly to the side, staring at me as if there was nothing else that could possibly interest him in that room. A new feeling, the small, warm flutter that started at the pit of my stomach, maybe it was just my heart that was starting to race in my chest.&nbsp;</p><p>Time had stopped, it had to, as there was no way I had spent so much time looking at him, and standing awkwardly in the middle of a room, while other two people witnessed my stupidity. I wasn&rsquo;t used to it, not to the rushing heart that was thumping in my chest, or to the hollow pit in my stomach that made it difficult to breathe. I wasn&rsquo;t used to not know what to do with my hands, or how to smile, or how to think.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Diana was looking at us, her green eyes dancing from one to the other while a coy smile started to form on her lips. &ldquo;Can we continue?&rdquo;</p><p>She was mocking me, of that I was certain. Her eyes followed me until I took a seat next to the other guy, whose name I had totally missed, and smirked when I finally looked at her. My cheeks felt hot, and my heart seemed to barely be recovering from a marathon.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; She continued, recovering her serious face as she turned to face us all. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing: We have an offer to make, which we think might benefit all of us. Our client is an up-and-coming Hollywood star, and as you may, or may not, know, we&rsquo;re pushing for her to be an Oscar nominee this award season. We almost have the Golden Globes nomination in the bag, and we&rsquo;re being as careful as possible with her overall image and fame.&rdquo;</p><p>I almost felt like I wasn&rsquo;t in the room, as if Diana wasn&rsquo;t talking about me. It was all too clinical, too impersonal, and I felt far away from it. I peered to my side and saw the guy next to me shifting awkwardly in his seat, just like if he knew what was coming, and regretted it deeply. As if he was waiting for a train to crash, and all he could do was stand there and let it happen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The movie she was in was very particular.&rdquo; Diana smiled, looking at me for the first time since she started. &ldquo;And she was wonderful in it. We&rsquo;re certain she&rsquo;ll have no problem creating buzz for herself, but&hellip;we&rsquo;d like to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Help how?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Ben, would you like to continue?&rdquo;</p><p>The guy next to me, whose name was Ben, didn&rsquo;t seem like he wanted to continue. He didn&rsquo;t seem like he wanted to be there actually, but he stood up and leaned against Diana&rsquo;s desk to look at us.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; He started. &ldquo;I owe Midge a favor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s reassuring.&rdquo; I heard Harry mock under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;We want to spread a rumor, and not deny it, about you two.&rdquo; He ignored Harry, and looked at me, as if I was an easier audience that would understand what was wanted of me. &ldquo;We want you to hang out, and act like a couple, a romantic one.&rdquo; But the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t protesting, or even talking, was not because I agreed with whatever he was saying, but rather, because I had no fucking idea of what was happening. Instead, I just stared at him dumbfounded. &ldquo;We think it might give you an edge. Your movie is about to hit theaters, and it might push people to go and check it out, just to see who&rsquo;s that girl Harry&rsquo;s dating. That and the buzz you already got during the festivals&rsquo; screenings, you might have a great chance next year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; Diana interjected. &ldquo;It might tip the balance in your favor in the Josh and Hazel&rsquo;s Guide to not Dating&rsquo;s casting. People don&rsquo;t really see you as a romantic lead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And, for you, Harry.&rdquo; Ben was rather cautious as he continued. &ldquo;We think it might give you exposure to a broader audience, and&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need exposure,&rdquo; Harry shook his head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You do. You&rsquo;re nothing without it, and that&rsquo;s exactly what you don&rsquo;t want to be,&rdquo; Diana explained in a rather cold tone. More like the Diana I knew and feared. &ldquo;We also think you&rsquo;ll be a really good Josh. If this all works out, who knows, maybe you&rsquo;ll even lead the movie. That&rsquo;s something people would love to see.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled at him, despite the fact that there was a deep set frown in his forehead, and that his face was not very friendly at that very moment. I still couldn&rsquo;t quite shake the feeling that this was happening to someone else, not to me. It couldn&rsquo;t be happening to me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you two talk, I&rsquo;m gonna get the papers ready,&rdquo; she said, taking Ben&rsquo;s hand to pull him out of the room to leave us alone.</p><p>&ldquo;I can act romantic,&rdquo; I mumbled as soon as she closed the door.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; I let my hand ran through my hair before looking at him. He was already staring at me, with that same intensity as when I first entered the room. He looked tired, and his eyes were puffy like he had barely gotten any sleep the night before. He switched on his seat until he was fully facing me, with his feet dangling from the arm-chair while he leaned back to the wall to make himself comfortable. The colorful planets on his black sweater made me smile, and before I could blush under his gaze, I looked down to my lap, not uttering a word as I felt his eyes on me.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I like your movies.&rdquo; I heard him say.&nbsp;</p><p>My eyes rose to his, which was definitely a mistake. It was easier not to look at him, not to see the way his pink mouth twitched when he was deep in thought and the anchor tattoo that was peeking under his black sweater. He was prettier by the minute, and I could feel a strange pull in my tummy, one I had never felt before, and I still couldn&rsquo;t decide if it was a good or a bad feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. My little sister really likes your music.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; He asked in amusement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I, I like Fireproof.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"That&rsquo;s a 1D song.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I still like it.&rdquo; I shrugged off, feeling elated as his sweet smile spread on his lips, showing off his bunny teeth and the dimples on his cheek. &ldquo;And Woman, I like Woman.&rdquo;</p><p>The fluttering in my stomach seemed to be growing, and I had to wonder if I was going to explode at any second now. He leaned forward, as if he was ready to tell me some big secret, and bit the corner of his lip as he got ready to say his next words.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to do this?&rdquo; He finally said.&nbsp;</p><p>I did. I didn&rsquo;t. I had no idea.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;ll work?&rdquo; My voice didn&rsquo;t sound like my own. It was laced with doubt and something else that I couldn&rsquo;t quite describe yet.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;People will believe whatever they want.&rdquo; He shrugged, returning my gesture in an effortless way.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&hellip;I just, I never seem to know how far I want this to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As far as you can go without losing yourself.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"How do you know you&rsquo;re not losing yourself?&rdquo; I asked in response, looking at him as his expression turned just a little bit darker. For a person so private, his face said too much.</p><p>&ldquo;You never really do,&rdquo; Harry whispered. &ldquo;I guess, you have to go with your gut.&rdquo;</p><p>My gut. My gut was untrusting and anxious, ready to flee at any second. It had done it before, now it was just waiting for a new opportunity to do it again, really.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; The words came out of my words even before I had processed. So easy, it almost hid the fact that I was an anxious-ridden mess on the inside. &ldquo;If&hellip;If you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell if he actually liked my answer. All of the sudden he got serious as if he had just realized what he was getting himself into, and he sighed, standing up from his chair to perch himself on Diana&rsquo;s desk in front of me. He was towering over me, which made me shift uncomfortably in my seat. When he noticed, he sat up straight, giving me some space to breathe better.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it then,&rdquo; He whispered. There was a tiny hint of disappointment, that grew from my chest and spread to my stomach at the tone of his voice as if this was an irritating chore.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do it. You don&rsquo;t know me after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have time to do that.&rdquo; He softened a little, looking at me with a small smile as I leaned back on my chair and crossed my arms around my chest in a protective way. &ldquo;Do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Sam.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A boyfriend, no,&rdquo; He mocked, smirking as my eyes blew wide in embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;uh, I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t mean a boyfriend. I was, I was asking for a girlfriend, but if you do have a boyfriend, I mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend either.&rdquo; He finally put an end to my misery. &ldquo;It makes things easier.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know what he meant and I decided against asking him about it. Instead, I chose to focus on the fact that he was single, which definitely gave me something to dream about. Even if I knew nothing was going to happen. Even if I knew this whole thing was nothing but an inconvenience for him.&nbsp;</p><p>That didn&rsquo;t stop the fluttering in my stomach. Probably nothing would.</p><p>I was about to say something when the door opened, and Diana entered the room with Ben. They were holding a bunch of papers each, which she set over her desk before throwing a triumphant smile at us.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think this is all we need.&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go through them before you take them to your team. Oh, and there&rsquo;s a party tonight, I want you both there. We need to set things in motion.&rdquo;</p><p>After that, there was nothing much to say, or do. Ben and Diana took over the conversation, arranging little details that I couldn&rsquo;t even begin to imagine. It was all a blur, of contracts and NDAs and rules that I was supposed to follow, but couldn&rsquo;t even remember. By the time they left, my head was spinning and I had to close my eyes tightly to stop myself from getting dizzy.&nbsp;</p><p>Diana had about a billion things more to discuss with me, ranging from the interview with James Corden, to new scripts, to the outfits I should wear to drop Cat at school, AKA something that didn&rsquo;t make me look like a crazy person walking through the streets of L.A. But there was too much in my head already, excitement, fear, numbling anxiety, and I could barely keep up with her, as she continued to check things from her to-do list. It was already 19:30 when was finally done, and I had about 1 hour to get ready for the party Diana wanted me to go.&nbsp;</p><p>I was so tired. I just wanted to go home.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, you can go now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks. Di, can I just&hellip;take a raincheck on that party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t. Harry&rsquo;s coming to get you at 9:15.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, D&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have fun, sweets.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t let me finish. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sooooo hot, try and behave.&rdquo;</p><p>He was, that was exactly the problem.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>***</b></h2><p>What Diana had forgotten to tell me was that Harry was not going to pick me up himself. Rather, his driver showed up to my front door, waiting patiently for me for about 20 more minutes until I was ready.</p><p>I was surprised when we got to the venue, as there were not as many paparazzi as I had thought there would be. Actually, there was none. There was only a couple of people by the door, and they all looked at me with surprised expressions as I walked by them, followed by Harry&rsquo;s driver.</p><p>It was never a good idea for me to go out. I got hugged and pulled and stared at. But here, everyone was calm, probably used to hanging out with people a lot more famous than me. I sucked in a deep breath, smiling at the people that waved at me and sometimes stopping to greet the people that I actually knew. As a result, it took me around 15 minutes to get to Harry&rsquo;s group.&nbsp;</p><p>He was leaning against the wall, holding a glass in his hand while he listened attentively to the girl that was standing in front of him. She was gorgeous, with her long hair layered in loose curls, and a red tight dress fitted like a glove to her absolutely drool-worthy body. She leaned over as if to tell him a secret, and he cocked his head to the side to allow her to do so. I could hear her flirty giggles, and I stopped where I was, suddenly realizing that I did not belong there.&nbsp;</p><p>What was I doing? This wasn&rsquo;t me.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned around before anyone could see me, and started my way back to the door. If I called an uber, I would be at home in around 30 minutes, and maybe Sam would go and watch movies with me. He could even bring his girlfriend! I was used to it.&nbsp;</p><p>I stood by the bar, leaning on it as I pulled out my phone from my clutch. I was glad I hadn&rsquo;t wasted a whole lot of time in my outfit, and that I had decided to wear a pair of black jeans and a t-shirt tucked in, with red heels and a black blazer, that way I didn&rsquo;t feel so disappointed, or embarrassed for the thousands of situations I had pictured in my head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like something to drink?&rdquo; I heard someone shout at me, which made me turn around to smile to the bartender.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;N&hellip;A shot of tequila, please.&rdquo; I found myself saying, to the bartender&rsquo;s pleasure. He winked at me and nodded solemnly as if mine was a great choice of alcohol.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Coming right up!&rdquo;</p><p>And he was right, as about a second later there was a short glass in front of me, dripping from tequila. He offered me salt and a wedge of lime, and I gladly took them before gulping down the shot. The dry liquor burned my throat on its way down, and I winced at the taste, slamming the glass on the table for him to refill.&nbsp;</p><p>But before I could grab the new shot he was offering me, someone else took it. I whirled around, ready to tell someone off, but instead, saw Harry as he tipped the glass and chugged it down, wincing as soon as he had finished. The salt and the lime the bartender had offered me were left unattended on the bar.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, that was mine!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; He said. The bar was a little quieter than the rest of the bar, so I noticed that his voice was a little hoarser than I remembered it from the morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Saw you drinking one on my way here. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>I could feel we were being watched closely by about a hundred people. I could feel their eyes, burning hole on my back as Harry leaned closer to me. He smelled of alcohol and a little bit of mint, and I struggled to stay still where I was, starting to recognize the signs of the strange feeling that had taken over me in the morning.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was about to leave,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;But was offered alcohol, so I ummm&hellip;got distracted for a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why were you leaving?&rdquo; Harry was pulling out his wallet, and before I could do anything about it, he handed the barman his credit card, signaling for two more shots to come.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh, I saw you back there, with the cute girl! I don&rsquo;t want to impose, Harry, and you&rsquo;re definitely gonna score with her, so I just&hellip;I can&rsquo;t mess with that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna score?&rdquo; He seemed amused by my affirmation, but I still nodded vigorously, taking the new shot I was being offered and downing it. It burned a little more and made my head a little more fuzzy than it was after the first one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You totally are, and she&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; I said, with my tongue feeling a little heavy as I talked.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry smirked like he knew I was right, and the girl was probably a goddess put on earth so we could all feel a little ashamed of ourselves. Kind of a reality check in the body of a breathtaking model.&nbsp;</p><p>He took his shot and drank it in one gulp, just like I had done seconds before. He winced, scrunching up his nose and smiling like a little kid as he slammed the glass down.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, you couldn&rsquo;t choose another drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like tequila,&rdquo; I shrugged, leaning to him to bump my shoulder against his. I stayed there, close to him as I smelled his faint cologne and the bitter alcohol in his breath. &ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m gonna go. You go get the girl, and we try this another day, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you do! That girl was hot as fuck, and it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m gonna give it to you&hellip;&rdquo; I stopped, growing hotter in embarrassment as I looked at him amused face. &ldquo;I should shut up.&rdquo;</p><p>His hands were warm and soft and they made my skin tingle as one of them slid carefully to the back of my neck. I stopped breathing, only able to look at him as he pulled me closer to his chest until his breath was fanning over my skin and I could almost taste the bittersweetness of his lips. I took a deep breath, noticing the little smile that played on his lips before he pressed our lips together.&nbsp;</p><p>The kiss wasn&rsquo;t soft, nor was it rough either. It was uncertain and eager as if we wanted to learn as much about each other as we possibly could. His fingers curled around my neck, as he brought me closer to him, and one of my hands tangled in the soft hairs that rested on the nape of his neck. He tasted like peppermint and tequila, and a sweetness I could not describe. My lips parted slightly, and I sighed into the kiss as he took command of it. Our lips were made for each other, of that I was sure, and I allowed myself to mold to him, while time around us stopped and rushed by at the same time. I leaned to him when he broke the kiss apart, looking for the warmth of his body even though he was right next by my side.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of cameras pointing at us.&rdquo; He whispered while his fingertips brushed down my neck, keeping me still close to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>He smiled, dissipating the heaviness that had set in my tummy at his words. &ldquo;And I really wanted to kiss you since this morning. You should stay.&rdquo;&ldquo;</p><p>\"Ask me really nicely, I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; I whispered, almost against his lips, already dreaming about the taste of them.&nbsp;</p><p>He was definitely trouble.&nbsp;</p></p>",
