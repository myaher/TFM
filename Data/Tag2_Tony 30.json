Lets say this story takes place in the alt 2014 universe, or you just pretend Endgame never happened it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It is just pointless fluff I\u2019ve been messing with for a few weeks.\u00a0 I feel like if I don\u2019t post it now I never will, and it\u2019s fitting that it is Tony\u2019s birthday. This is not a birthday fic, but if I could give Tony Stark anything for his birthday, it would be his happy ending.</p><hr><p>\u201cMagoona!\u201d Tony Stark called across the yard, \u201cchow time!\u201d  </p><p>When there was no reply from his daughter, he slowly made his way down the porch steps to begin the search for her. He knew it wouldn\u2019t take long, she was easy to find these days. His knees would be grateful. They ached a bit with each step; too many rough landings in his lifetime.</p><p>He walked to the side of the house where he noticed the garden hose was stretched to its limit, and disappeared around the back of the house. Grinning, he followed the hose to the garage door that was open a fraction to accommodate it. Tony could hear the sounds of his daughter tinkering away inside, completely oblivious to the outside world. He peeked through the door silently so he could watch her without being noticed.</p><p>The first thing he saw was Dum-E standing ready with the garden hose clamped in his claw. </p><p>\u2018Fire-safety,\u2019 Tony thought. He always told Morgan to have someone ready to put out a fire when she was working in the garage (He learned from experience). It was nice to know she listened, even if Dum-E didn\u2019t have the best track record when it came to being helpful.  </p><p>He looked over to his daughter and he couldn\u2019t stop the swell of pride that filled his chest. She was eleven years old now, and was she\u2026yep, she was soldering all by herself. Her back was to him, but he could imagine the look of concentration on her face as she created something of her own. She was standing at the worktable he made for her. It was low to the ground so she wouldn\u2019t have to sit or stand on a stool while she worked. It wouldn\u2019t be long before she started using his own work area. She was growing up so fast, and all he could do was savor every second of it.  He watched as her hands work confidently with each task. The gloves she wore were still a little too big for her. Her skinny arms were covered up to her elbows in the leather. The goggles she wore were an old pair of his from his college days. Rhodey had gifted them to him on his 15th birthday, and now it was fitting that Morgan would have them. They were really getting a workout lately. She\u2019d been working in the garage every day for over a month, refusing his help every time he offered. It hurt him at first because they always worked together in the garage, but Pepper had convinced him it was important for Morgan to come up with her own ideas and learn to rely on herself. Tony agreed she was plenty smart enough to start working on her own projects. He just missed working with her.</p><p>Tony was so lost in his thoughts that he nearly jumped out of his skin when Pepper tapped him on the shoulder.  </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered quickly, rubbing his shoulders and back as he calmed himself down.\u00a0 \u201cI wanted to find out what the hold up was,\u201d Pepper explained, still apologetic.</p><p>Tony shook his head, letting out a long sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he reassured her, \u201cI was on cloud nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d she said with a smile, looking through the garage door at their daughter. </p><p>\u201cDid you teach her how to use that thing?\u201d she asked, her smile waning as black smoke drifted up around Morgan\u2019s head. </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cLook, she\u2019s got her gloves, her goggles, and Dum-E on fire-safety,\u201d  he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked,\u201d she smirked back at him. </p><p>He felt compelled to defend his first bot. \u201cSay what you want about Dum-E, I can guarantee you he\u2019ll flood the garage before anything in there catches fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell never mind then,\u201d she deadpanned, eyes shining with mirth. </p><p>Suddenly the garage door opened to reveal Morgan stark looking every inch the mechanic. Safety goggles up on her head, gloved hands at her waist, and motor oil staining her clothes and skin. </p><p>\u201cIs dinner ready?\u201d she asked blinking up at her parents. </p><p>\u201cSure is sweety pie,\u201d Tony said while reaching down and scrubbing some oil off of her chin. </p><p>\u201cMake sure you wash up first,\u201d Pepper told Morgan, but looked right at Tony, \u201cyour father already made a big enough mess today trying to use the blender.\u201d</p><p>Morgan giggled as Tony gave a bashful smile.\u00a0</p><p>Pepper looked at her giggling daughter and the resemblance to Tony was striking. She\u2019d never get over it. The unruly hair, the big dark eyes, and a smile that could light up a city.\u00a0 She was reminded of all of the times she would go down to Tony\u2019s workshop and he\u2019d be wearing his grease stained clothes, blasting his obnoxious music, and smile ear to ear at the sight of her. More often than not she had to remind him to eat something or he\u2019d go all day without anything in his stomach but caffeine. It all felt like a lifetime ago\u2026it almost was. They had come such a long way in 30 years. Now here she was calling their daughter to dinner. Tears sprung to her eyes at the thought, but she didn\u2019t let them fall, not wanting to ruin her daughters happiness.</p><p>\u201cGo put your things away before we eat.\u201c\u00a0 Pepper ordered gently before kissing the top of Morgan\u2019s head.\u00a0</p><p>Morgan nodded, spinning around and going back into the barn to put her gloves and goggles in their proper place. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fix that blender so it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Tony promised, taking her hand in his and entwining their fingers.</p><p>Pepper smiled and kissed her husband. He was irresistible, even after painting the kitchen with tomato sauce. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will, just like you fixed the kitchen sink.\u201d </p><p>He smiled back and nodded, \u201cthat\u2019s right. That dishwasher was a life saver.\u201d</p><p>Pepper kissed him again before she pulled away. \u201cI\u2019m going to check on the chicken before you have to upgrade the oven too.\u201d </p><p>She caressed his cheek as she walked away, leaving his skin tingling. He watched her walk back to the house with the same beauty and grace she had on the very first day he saw her.\u00a0</p><p>He was the luckiest man in the world. </p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Morgan asked, getting his attention.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDo you think you can teach me how to use the welder tomorrow?\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony whistled. \u201cThe welder, huh?

Lets say this story takes place in the alt 2014 universe, or you just pretend Endgame never happened it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It is just pointless fluff I&rsquo;ve been messing with for a few weeks.&nbsp; I feel like if I don&rsquo;t post it now I never will, and it&rsquo;s fitting that it is Tony&rsquo;s birthday. This is not a birthday fic, but if I could give Tony Stark anything for his birthday, it would be his happy ending.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Magoona!&rdquo; Tony Stark called across the yard, &ldquo;chow time!&rdquo;  </p><p>When there was no reply from his daughter, he slowly made his way down the porch steps to begin the search for her. He knew it wouldn&rsquo;t take long, she was easy to find these days. His knees would be grateful. They ached a bit with each step; too many rough landings in his lifetime.</p><p>He walked to the side of the house where he noticed the garden hose was stretched to its limit, and disappeared around the back of the house. Grinning, he followed the hose to the garage door that was open a fraction to accommodate it. Tony could hear the sounds of his daughter tinkering away inside, completely oblivious to the outside world. He peeked through the door silently so he could watch her without being noticed.</p><p>The first thing he saw was Dum-E standing ready with the garden hose clamped in his claw. </p><p>&lsquo;Fire-safety,&rsquo; Tony thought. He always told Morgan to have someone ready to put out a fire when she was working in the garage (He learned from experience). It was nice to know she listened, even if Dum-E didn&rsquo;t have the best track record when it came to being helpful.  </p><p>He looked over to his daughter and he couldn&rsquo;t stop the swell of pride that filled his chest. She was eleven years old now, and was she&hellip;yep, she was soldering all by herself. Her back was to him, but he could imagine the look of concentration on her face as she created something of her own. She was standing at the worktable he made for her. It was low to the ground so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to sit or stand on a stool while she worked. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before she started using his own work area. She was growing up so fast, and all he could do was savor every second of it.  He watched as her hands work confidently with each task. The gloves she wore were still a little too big for her. Her skinny arms were covered up to her elbows in the leather. The goggles she wore were an old pair of his from his college days. Rhodey had gifted them to him on his 15th birthday, and now it was fitting that Morgan would have them. They were really getting a workout lately. She&rsquo;d been working in the garage every day for over a month, refusing his help every time he offered. It hurt him at first because they always worked together in the garage, but Pepper had convinced him it was important for Morgan to come up with her own ideas and learn to rely on herself. Tony agreed she was plenty smart enough to start working on her own projects. He just missed working with her.</p><p>Tony was so lost in his thoughts that he nearly jumped out of his skin when Pepper tapped him on the shoulder.  </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she whispered quickly, rubbing his shoulders and back as he calmed himself down.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wanted to find out what the hold up was,&rdquo; Pepper explained, still apologetic.</p><p>Tony shook his head, letting out a long sigh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he reassured her, &ldquo;I was on cloud nine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see that,&rdquo; she said with a smile, looking through the garage door at their daughter. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you teach her how to use that thing?&rdquo; she asked, her smile waning as black smoke drifted up around Morgan&rsquo;s head. </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Safely?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; he said defensively. &ldquo;Look, she&rsquo;s got her gloves, her goggles, and Dum-E on fire-safety,&rdquo;  he pointed out.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I asked,&rdquo; she smirked back at him. </p><p>He felt compelled to defend his first bot. &ldquo;Say what you want about Dum-E, I can guarantee you he&rsquo;ll flood the garage before anything in there catches fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well never mind then,&rdquo; she deadpanned, eyes shining with mirth. </p><p>Suddenly the garage door opened to reveal Morgan stark looking every inch the mechanic. Safety goggles up on her head, gloved hands at her waist, and motor oil staining her clothes and skin. </p><p>&ldquo;Is dinner ready?&rdquo; she asked blinking up at her parents. </p><p>&ldquo;Sure is sweety pie,&rdquo; Tony said while reaching down and scrubbing some oil off of her chin. </p><p>&ldquo;Make sure you wash up first,&rdquo; Pepper told Morgan, but looked right at Tony, &ldquo;your father already made a big enough mess today trying to use the blender.&rdquo;</p><p>Morgan giggled as Tony gave a bashful smile.&nbsp;</p><p>Pepper looked at her giggling daughter and the resemblance to Tony was striking. She&rsquo;d never get over it. The unruly hair, the big dark eyes, and a smile that could light up a city.&nbsp; She was reminded of all of the times she would go down to Tony&rsquo;s workshop and he&rsquo;d be wearing his grease stained clothes, blasting his obnoxious music, and smile ear to ear at the sight of her. More often than not she had to remind him to eat something or he&rsquo;d go all day without anything in his stomach but caffeine. It all felt like a lifetime ago&hellip;it almost was. They had come such a long way in 30 years. Now here she was calling their daughter to dinner. Tears sprung to her eyes at the thought, but she didn&rsquo;t let them fall, not wanting to ruin her daughters happiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Go put your things away before we eat.&ldquo;&nbsp; Pepper ordered gently before kissing the top of Morgan&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;</p><p>Morgan nodded, spinning around and going back into the barn to put her gloves and goggles in their proper place. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fix that blender so it doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; Tony promised, taking her hand in his and entwining their fingers.</p><p>Pepper smiled and kissed her husband.
