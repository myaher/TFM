                "content": "<p>So I was going back and forth with <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZzIsjGdWQHKW_I7XKeQB2g\">@scratchybeardsweetmouth</a> in the comments of <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18884572\">A Bane of the Heart</a>, and realized that basically the Dany/Jorah meta we were discussing was something that I wanted to articulate outside of that setting.</p><p>We started out talking about my choice to have Jorah not question his understanding about where he stands with her, that she&rsquo;s not interested in him romantically, based on the hints to the contrary she&rsquo;s giving off through the fic, and thus be completely taken by surprise when she straight up tells him otherwise.</p><p>My rationale was that Jorah would have a hard time interpreting Dany&rsquo;s change in approach towards him partly because he truly accepted the prior status quo, but honestly more so because it isn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;new&rdquo; the way she is reacting to him in the fic. Like she was in denial about her heart eyes before but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she wasn&rsquo;t making them, so he&rsquo;s been persuaded that isn&rsquo;t evidence or even a hint of her being romantically interested in him&hellip; when really it is just that she wasn&rsquo;t conscious of how that has been there under the surface for her for a long time. So he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Not going to misread this totally platonic gazing Khaleesi is doing. Nope. I will just be grateful that she is seemingly happy to be in my company again. This foolish old bear knows better.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZzIsjGdWQHKW_I7XKeQB2g\">@scratchybeardsweetmouth</a> brought up the books, saying:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I know his book version is not popular and I understand that, but it is in some ways the similar kind of affections she showed him that he thought she reciprocated his feelings and so he took his chance by kissing her. And so when she expressed that she didn&rsquo;t desire him and then was banished later on, there is this realization that just being by her side and serving her was enough for him and so he does not want to destroy his precious bond with her, especially if she gives him a chance to stand by her again. With this fic that eventually plays out she did have feelings for him, it feels so real that denial on his part would be expected.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Which is what triggered the real heart of this meta:&nbsp;</p><p><b>There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons that the show vs book versions of them feel really different to me, and some of them are adaptation choices, but I think part of it is straight up the difference of medium. In the books, we are in Dany&rsquo;s head. We see through her eyes and feel through her emotions. So we know what her actions mean to her, how she sees him, and we anticipate her reactions. In a show, we see both of them from an outside perspective, watching their actions, body language, and expression&hellip; listening to words and tone. And I don&rsquo;t know how intentional exactly the way those come off was, but it&rsquo;s very real and from the perspective of viewing the show and seeing/hearing her interact with him from the outside&hellip; I can understand why he would hold that hope.</b> I suppose that I would probably have read their dynamic very differently than I did originally if you read their interactions from Jorah&rsquo;s POV instead of Dany&rsquo;s for exactly these reasons.</p><p>Also, the fact that he reconciles his feelings and accepts what is instead of what he wanted to see&hellip; is a huge part of what makes them shippable for me. Like that&rsquo;s the moment where his love for her actually deepens into something more substantial really. Because it isn&rsquo;t transactional. It isn&rsquo;t based on expecting or seeking something out of it. He just loves her and wants to be there with/for her in the ways she is available for. Not because he doesn&rsquo;t still want her, but because it doesn&rsquo;t matter if she doesn&rsquo;t (in terms of his feelings, not in terms of not caring about her wants).</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZzIsjGdWQHKW_I7XKeQB2g\">@scratchybeardsweetmouth</a> added:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The difference in mediums allows us to see their interactions in the show without the internal monologue, and so it leaves us to take them for what they are, which already are telling us so much because of their acting. That said, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a Jorah POV just once in future books.</p><p>Everything about the second paragraph makes me nod and smile, especially \"Because it isn&rsquo;t transactional.&rdquo; I think for me it went back to the first funeral pyre scene - where I began to root for them - where he simply wanted her to choose to live, thinking that she&rsquo;ll be sacrificing her life to join her husband. Others might say he needed her to survive for the contract with Varys or that she is his ticket to Westeros. But he never stopped her as she walked into the flames after she promised him self-sacrifice isn&rsquo;t the goal. He trusted her and loved her that he wanted her to live to see that even with painful losses, life is still worth living.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><i>(*heavy breathing* I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT MIND A JORAH POV.)</i></p><p>I can&rsquo;t even pinpoint the moment in the show where I started shipping them (I, like Daenerys was perhaps in denial about my feelings for a long time).</p><p>But that scene is so incredibly powerful. It&rsquo;s so pure. I truly believe that he meant everything he said there, and you know she did too. (The idea that he, at that point, was still there for a &ldquo;deal&rdquo; feels very intentionally and unnecessarily negative and cynical&hellip; he&rsquo;d already had a chance to go home and he chose her over it!) He chooses to believe in her there, to discard his cynicism and stand aside and allow her step into becoming a legend. He could have dragged her away from that pyre, and the truth is that she would have forgiven him. She would never have really known what she lost and she would have known that he was protecting her as best he could. But instead he trusts her and stands by her choice and watches her ascend to the level of myths.</p><p>A lot happens after this point: her discovery that he was initially spying on her for Robert&rsquo;s small council, his banishment, Tyrion&rsquo;s input, everything that happens with Daario and Jon, Jorah&rsquo;s greyscale.&nbsp; All of it important and worthy of discussion, of course, but perhaps not as important as the way her face lights up for Jorah alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",
