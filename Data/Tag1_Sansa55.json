This\u00a0is all her doing, entirely her idea. I only gave context and added some descriptions.)</p><p>There is a shamelessly inspired scene from Edward and Winry in FMA</p><p>*</p><p>(Sansa)</p><p>Goes like this. </p><p>The battle is over and you have won. You survived. You should feel happy, relieved. Every time you close your eyes, though, you think back to the heartrending screams of women, the silent crying of children, the rasping sounds of the wights. The smell of blood and rotting flesh, the sour taste of terror in your mouth. The feeling of being once again that impotent little girl, struck by the swords of knights without honor, kneeling on flagstones. Helpless. Powerless.</p><p>Once before, in the past, you experienced this desolation, this discouragement, this rage. You promised yourself that you would never ever allow it to happen again. You thought to be changed, to be different. You lied to yourself.</p><p>You&rsquo;re stronger, but it&rsquo;s still not enough.</p><p>*</p><p>When you expose your reasons to Arya, you expect a certain kind of expression, certain words, a particular look. What you didn&rsquo;t expect is that she reacts as if your request didn&rsquo;t surprise her at all and on the contrary she considers it completely legitimate.</p><p>Arya urges you to take your dagger and you widen your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; You ask and feel your hands begin to tremble and sweat. You&rsquo;re nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Arya replies, unmoved.</p><p>You obey and when you hold it, you feel stupid just like the first time. You know how you must appear in Arya&rsquo;s eyes. Clumsy and graceless. A part inside you whispers,<i> it serves you right</i>, it's\u00a0as the wind blows. You once laughed with Jeyne at the way Arya seemed to stumble over her feet when she tried to dance. Now it&rsquo;s your turn.</p><p>You prepare yourself to be criticized, derided and instead get suggestions, advice and constructive criticism expressed with a slightly teasing tone, but not enough to hurt your sensitivity. They help you understand your mistakes.</p><p>And you realize that you have nothing to fear. Because Arya is your family and you are both grown up, learning to accept yourself, to appreciate what you have become.</p><p>You bend your legs and arm in the stance that Arya just showed you. You raise your chin. You can do it.</p><p>*</p><p>(Jon)</p><p>This is how it starts for you.</p><p>You noticed that something has changed in the relationship between Sansa and Arya. You knew it from the moment when instead of teasing her, Arya defended her in the godswood.</p><p>During the days after the battle (they already call it the Long Night and you can understand why. In a sense it seemed interminable.) you have the confirmation of it when you see them sneak over and over again together, disappear inside the fortress or head towards the godswood. At first you don&rsquo;t mind, even if you notice it. How could you not? Your attention is divided equally between politics and your family.</p><p>The day arrives when curiosity has the upper hand. Strangely, you are alone. What&rsquo;s the harm in wanting to know? You follow them.</p><p>You hear them before you see them. Arya is giving orders in a severe but calm and encouraging tone. If you didn&rsquo;t find the idea absurd, you&rsquo;d almost think that -</p><p>You accelerate the pace and finally get the full view. They&rsquo;re in front of the heart tree. Both don&rsquo;t wear cloaks and Sansa has her hair braided backwards in the complicated hairstyle she&rsquo;s been using more and more often lately. You thought it was for vanity. It was foolish\u00a0of you. Sansa doesn&rsquo;t care about that kind of thing, not anymore. Now you sense your mistake. It was for practicality. That has always been the reason.</p><p>Unseen, hidden behind the trunk of a tree, you look at them. Sansa is clearly inexperienced. Her movements, however graceful, lack precision, rapidity. They are not incisive enough. Her elbow, for example.</p><p>&ldquo;Your elbow is too high,&rdquo; Arya states and approaches to show her the most appropriate angle.</p><p>You stay and it goes on like this for a while. For everything you want to say, every correction, Arya beats you on time.</p><p>Silent as you arrived, you turn around to go back inside. You can recognize when your presence is not necessary.</p><p>*</p><p>That night, your steps lead you to her solar. You don&rsquo;t knock and don&rsquo;t regret it. Sansa&rsquo;s got her back\u00a0to you. She didn&rsquo;t hear you come in and you enjoy the precious moments before she notices you. She seems so focused. In the privacy of her chambers, her hair is a free and wild waterfall behind her back. The air around her seems to vibrate and crackle with energy, the quiet before the storm.</p><p>She wears that corset that resembles an armor. You regret not be able to see her expression, but you know it must be proud and determined.</p><p>You look at her and you can&rsquo;t help feeling the usual blusterous emotions. For once you don&rsquo;t feel guilty. </p><p>She&rsquo;s so beautiful that it breaks your heart, but Sansa isn&rsquo;t just her pretty face. She is the insight into hard eyes, the sharpness of a piercing mind, the ability to listen and be listened, the value she gives to every word because she believes that they are lethal weapons just like any sword. She is not a warrior, but her fighting spirit rivals that of the best soldiers. You look at her with your arms crossed over your chest.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too stiff,&rdquo; you comments without being able to hold back any further. You immediately regret it. If she was composed first, now her back appears to be carved in stone. You observe the change and when she turns with a lightning movement, red hair like a comet&rsquo;s fiery trail, her face is frowning and irritated. Whether it is with you or with herself, because she didn&rsquo;t hear you, you can&rsquo;t understand.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been there spying on me?&rdquo; She asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I was simply offering some constructive criticism.&rdquo; You used a joking tone, but her reaction is instantaneous and you understand that you said the wrong thing.</p><p>She lowers her eyes, and so the arm holding the dagger against her side. She bites her lip from embarrassment and frustration.</p><p>Before you can say you&rsquo;re sorry and you didn&rsquo;t mean it, not in the way you said it at least, she surprises you. &ldquo;You could show me,&rdquo; she says and crosses your gaze steadily.</p><p>You nod, unable to put into words what you are thinking. She is asking for your help and you would like to be a better man and not feel this mixture of pride and happiness. With Sansa everything seems easy and goddamn complicated, even the smallest and most innocent things. You clear your throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; you murmur and detach yourself from the wall on which you were leaning. You move, carrying yourself behind her and if you are closer than strictly necessary, it is a secret that you will take to your grave. (You don&rsquo;t notice how her pupils are dilated, her flared nostrils. If you notice the redness on her cheeks, you connect it to physical exertion. You know nothing. Even today.)</p><p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; You inquire before touching her.</p><p>Sansa gives you a look that you can&rsquo;t figure out, but nods.</p><p>You place one hand on her hip, with the other you guide the movement of her arm. Meanwhile you bend to inhale the ladylike and rich scent of her skin, something sweet and acrid in the oxymoron that Sansa represents. You feel like a lost man, damned. You don&rsquo;t care. If the price you have to pay for being with her is this torment, you prefer it. You have been away for months and it was an agonizing experience.</p><p>After you&rsquo;ve shown her how to move, you bring yourself in front of her and point out where to hit. Closed in its sheath, the dagger touches you under the jugular, against the chest, in the stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good dagger,&rdquo; you say, observing how the handle seems made for her long,\u00a0tapered\u00a0hand. It fits perfectly.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya gave it to me during the battle.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Did you use it?</i> You would like to ask her. The chance are high.</p><p>&ldquo;Stick them with\u00a0the pointy end.&rdquo; Sansa is looking at you sideways. &ldquo;It was the advice that Arya gave me. Her first lesson.&rdquo;</p><p>You would like to burst out laughing, confide to her that you were the one to say that first. Instead you listen to her labored breathing and the laughter dies in your throat, assuages like steam, like breath in the coldness of the night. &ldquo;It saved me. If I hadn&rsquo;t had this dagger, I&rsquo;d probably be dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Your grip on her becomes ironclad. To imagine her defenseless and alone in the crypts, surrounded by wights. You tried not to think about it. But now you are and your blood is freezing. You have been so close to losing her.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; you admit and you find reflected in her shiny eyes the same liquid turmoil that shakes you to the bone, the courage born out of fear to not surviving, the strength of despair. And now confusion. She doesn&rsquo;t understand and why should she? Sometimes you can&rsquo;t understand yourself. The depth of feelings towards her is beyond all understanding and reason.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; you repeat, surrounding her waist and resting your forehead against hers. You are the same height, nose to nose, eyes to eyes. If you only could (not if you only wanted to. You know you want it. You want it like you wanted a few other things in your life. Knowing the truth about your mother. Being a Stark), you could touch her mouth with yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo;</p><p>You hear the question in her voice. You hate the idea of \u200b\u200bher at the mercy of events, especially because it sounds so wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;Your hands,&rdquo; you begin. You want to explain how it is for you, what it means. To understand her need in learning to defend herself and at the same time to feel like a failure. She shouldn&rsquo;t have to do it. It is the proof that you didn&rsquo;t protect her as you should have. Furthermore you are terrified she&rsquo;s going to end up in\u00a0combat.</p><p>&ldquo;Your hands aren&rsquo;t meant to kill.&rdquo;</p><p>You see her scowl, blinking rapidly. Her eyelashes are dark and long, casting palpitating shadows against her cheekbones.</p><p>&ldquo;Not even to save,&rdquo; she says bitterly, with self-deprecation. &ldquo;I want to be useful.&rdquo; There is something petulant in the way she said it, ardent and hurt in her expression. <i>I am not useless, worthless or weak</i>, it&rsquo;s implied. You want to reassure her that if you react in this way it is precisely for the opposite reason. Suddenly she looks young and vulnerable.</p><p>It is rare to remember how young she is, how young all of you are. (Your father - Ned was younger than you when he lost a father and a brother, he saw his sister die, he fought in the Rebellion.) You tend to forget that you are still young. Sometimes it seems that you are as old as a heart tree, tired as if every battle fought was worth one hundred. And it&rsquo;s not over yet.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how it feels,&rdquo; you hear her murmur, so low you wouldn&rsquo;t have heard it if you weren&rsquo;t so close. &ldquo;Not being able to fight. Being forced to hide and hear around you your people, women and children you promised to protect, dying and screaming in terror, knowing you can&rsquo;t do anything. If only I had been faster, stronger, braver, I could have saved them. Not all of them, but at least a small part. You were right about the battle. I was stupid, but I learn from my mistakes and I don&rsquo;t intend to commit this one a second time.&rdquo;</p><p>You understand how she feels. It&rsquo;s how you feel too thinking of Edd, of Lyanna Mormont. You could have done more. It is the guilt of the survivors. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t save everyone,&rdquo; you tell her. With the thumb you stroke the corner of her mouth. &ldquo;But to know it, don&rsquo;t prevent us from trying.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa sighs and turns her face against your hand, like a flower in search of the warmth of the sun. You open your hand and rest it against her cheek and when she touches the inside of your wrist with her lips, time seems to stop for both of you, freezing. Now you finally notice it. The shortness of her breathing, her pupils dilated, the way her eyes darted towards your mouth. Oh. The temptation is irresistible.</p><p>You know what&rsquo;s going to happen. You should be ashamed, you should think it&rsquo;s wrong. Sansa is your sister. But she isn&rsquo;t. She is your cousin and it is such a convenient solution to know that you could kiss her, that in the eyes of the gods it wouldn&rsquo;t be an abomination. You&rsquo;re about to do it, but then someone knocks at the door.</p><p>*</p><p>Someone knocks at the door. You look at each other, you and Jon, and the tension cracks until it breaks.</p><p>You invite to enter. You already have a vague idea of \u200b\u200bwho it may be so it doesn&rsquo;t surprise you when Brienne&rsquo;s blonde head peeps out. &ldquo;I came to bid you a good night, my lady. If you don&rsquo;t need me anymore-&rdquo;</p><p>You observe the moment when she realizes that you are not alone. Her eyes widen and her eyebrows shoot upward. &ldquo;My apologies,&rdquo; she says in a tone that would make other girls blush. &ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t interrupt you.&rdquo;</p><p>The proximity of your bodies, Jon&rsquo;s hand still lingering on your neck. Or maybe you have become paranoid and the naked astonishment is simply due to the dagger you are still holding.</p><p>&ldquo;We had finished,&rdquo; you hear Jon say.</p><p>You want to protest. There is no polite way to confirm that Brienne has indeed disturbed you and that she interrupted&hellip; whatever she interrupted. He must sense your disappointment because he smiles at you, warm and reassuring, forming crinkles at the edges of his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;We will talk another time,&rdquo; he says with the tone of a promise and for a moment he seems to want to add more, but Brienne&rsquo;s presence holds him back. Your heart makes a flip. You feel the cheeks warm and you have never been so acutely aware of your body, in all its parts. You try to convince yourself that there is nothing inappropriate.</p><p>When he kisses your forehead, just above the eyebrow, you can&rsquo;t help but compare the gesture with the affection of another brother. Robb would never have done it, not with this tenderness, with so much longing.</p><p>Oh. <i>Oh</i>.</p><p>It should feel wrong. You don&rsquo;t care.</p><p>The adoration and desire in Jon&rsquo;s eyes&hellip; Your cousin.</p><p>You see him leave, his absence already in this noticeable\u00a0wave of sudden cold.</p><p>You can imagine what he wants to talk about. You touch your lips with the tip of the fingers, containing little and badly a broad smile.</p><p><i>You can&rsquo;t wait</i>.</p>",

Strangely, you are alone. What\u2019s the harm in wanting to know? You follow them.</p><p>You hear them before you see them. Arya is giving orders in a severe but calm and encouraging tone. If you didn\u2019t find the idea absurd, you\u2019d almost think that -</p><p>You accelerate the pace and finally get the full view. They\u2019re in front of the heart tree. Both don\u2019t wear cloaks and Sansa has her hair braided backwards in the complicated hairstyle she\u2019s been using more and more often lately. You thought it was for vanity. It was foolish\u00a0of you. Sansa doesn\u2019t care about that kind of thing, not anymore. Now you sense your mistake. It was for practicality. That has always been the reason.</p><p>Unseen, hidden behind the trunk of a tree, you look at them. Sansa is clearly inexperienced. Her movements, however graceful, lack precision, rapidity. They are not incisive enough. Her elbow, for example.</p><p>\u201cYour elbow is too high,\u201d Arya states and approaches to show her the most appropriate angle.</p><p>You stay and it goes on like this for a while. For everything you want to say, every correction, Arya beats you on time.</p><p>Silent as you arrived, you turn around to go back inside. You can recognize when your presence is not necessary.</p><p>*</p><p>That night, your steps lead you to her solar. You don\u2019t knock and don\u2019t regret it. Sansa\u2019s got her back\u00a0to you. She didn\u2019t hear you come in and you enjoy the precious moments before she notices you. She seems so focused. In the privacy of her chambers, her hair is a free and wild waterfall behind her back. The air around her seems to vibrate and crackle with energy, the quiet before the storm.</p><p>She wears that corset that resembles an armor. You regret not be able to see her expression, but you know it must be proud and determined.</p><p>You look at her and you can\u2019t help feeling the usual blusterous emotions. For once you don\u2019t feel guilty. </p><p>She\u2019s so beautiful that it breaks your heart, but Sansa isn\u2019t just her pretty face. She is the insight into hard eyes, the sharpness of a piercing mind, the ability to listen and be listened, the value she gives to every word because she believes that they are lethal weapons just like any sword. She is not a warrior, but her fighting spirit rivals that of the best soldiers. You look at her with your arms crossed over your chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too stiff,\u201d you comments without being able to hold back any further. You immediately regret it. If she was composed first, now her back appears to be carved in stone. You observe the change and when she turns with a lightning movement, red hair like a comet\u2019s fiery trail, her face is frowning and irritated. Whether it is with you or with herself, because she didn\u2019t hear you, you can\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been there spying on me?\u201d She asks.</p><p>\u201cI was simply offering some constructive criticism.\u201d You used a joking tone, but her reaction is instantaneous and you understand that you said the wrong thing.</p><p>She lowers her eyes, and so the arm holding the dagger against her side. She bites her lip from embarrassment and frustration.</p><p>Before you can say you\u2019re sorry and you didn\u2019t mean it, not in the way you said it at least, she surprises you. \u201cYou could show me,\u201d she says and crosses your gaze steadily.</p><p>You nod, unable to put into words what you are thinking. She is asking for your help and you would like to be a better man and not feel this mixture of pride and happiness. With Sansa everything seems easy and goddamn complicated, even the smallest and most innocent things. You clear your throat.</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d you murmur and detach yourself from the wall on which you were leaning. You move, carrying yourself behind her and if you are closer than strictly necessary, it is a secret that you will take to your grave. (You don\u2019t notice how her pupils are dilated, her flared nostrils. If you notice the redness on her cheeks, you connect it to physical exertion. You know nothing. Even today.)</p><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d You inquire before touching her.</p><p>Sansa gives you a look that you can\u2019t figure out, but nods.</p><p>You place one hand on her hip, with the other you guide the movement of her arm. Meanwhile you bend to inhale the ladylike and rich scent of her skin, something sweet and acrid in the oxymoron that Sansa represents. You feel like a lost man, damned. You don\u2019t care. If the price you have to pay for being with her is this torment, you prefer it. You have been away for months and it was an agonizing experience.</p><p>After you\u2019ve shown her how to move, you bring yourself in front of her and point out where to hit. Closed in its sheath, the dagger touches you under the jugular, against the chest, in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good dagger,\u201d you say, observing how the handle seems made for her long,\u00a0tapered\u00a0hand. It fits perfectly.</p><p>\u201cArya gave it to me during the battle.\u201d</p><p><i>Did you use it?</i> You would like to ask her. The chance are high.</p><p>\u201cStick them with\u00a0the pointy end.\u201d Sansa is looking at you sideways. \u201cIt was the advice that Arya gave me. Her first lesson.\u201d</p><p>You would like to burst out laughing, confide to her that you were the one to say that first. Instead you listen to her labored breathing and the laughter dies in your throat, assuages like steam, like breath in the coldness of the night. \u201cIt saved me. If I hadn\u2019t had this dagger, I\u2019d probably be dead.\u201d</p><p>Your grip on her becomes ironclad. To imagine her defenseless and alone in the crypts, surrounded by wights. You tried not to think about it. But now you are and your blood is freezing. You have been so close to losing her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d you admit and you find reflected in her shiny eyes the same liquid turmoil that shakes you to the bone, the courage born out of fear to not surviving, the strength of despair. And now confusion. She doesn\u2019t understand and why should she? Sometimes you can\u2019t understand yourself. The depth of feelings towards her is beyond all understanding and reason.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d you repeat, surrounding her waist and resting your forehead against hers. You are the same height, nose to nose, eyes to eyes. If you only could (not if you only wanted to. You know you want it. You want it like you wanted a few other things in your life. Knowing the truth about your mother. Being a Stark), you could touch her mouth with yours.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>You hear the question in her voice. You hate the idea of \u200b\u200bher at the mercy of events, especially because it sounds so wrong.</p><p>\u201cYour hands,\u201d you begin. You want to explain how it is for you, what it means. To understand her need in learning to defend herself and at the same time to feel like a failure. She shouldn\u2019t have to do it. It is the proof that you didn\u2019t protect her as you should have. Furthermore you are terrified she\u2019s going to end up in\u00a0combat.</p><p>\u201cYour hands aren\u2019t meant to kill.\u201d</p><p>You see her scowl, blinking rapidly. Her eyelashes are dark and long, casting palpitating shadows against her cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cNot even to save,\u201d she says bitterly, with self-deprecation. \u201cI want to be useful.\u201d There is something petulant in the way she said it, ardent and hurt in her expression. <i>I am not useless, worthless or weak</i>, it\u2019s implied. You want to reassure her that if you react in this way it is precisely for the opposite reason. Suddenly she looks young and vulnerable.</p><p>It is rare to remember how young she is, how young all of you are. (Your father - Ned was younger than you when he lost a father and a brother, he saw his sister die, he fought in the Rebellion.) You tend to forget that you are still young. Sometimes it seems that you are as old as a heart tree, tired as if every battle fought was worth one hundred. And it\u2019s not over yet.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how it feels,\u201d you hear her murmur, so low you wouldn\u2019t have heard it if you weren\u2019t so close. \u201cNot being able to fight. Being forced to hide and hear around you your people, women and children you promised to protect, dying and screaming in terror, knowing you can\u2019t do anything. If only I had been faster, stronger, braver, I could have saved them. Not all of them, but at least a small part. You were right about the battle. I was stupid, but I learn from my mistakes and I don\u2019t intend to commit this one a second time.\u201d</p><p>You understand how she feels. It\u2019s how you feel too thinking of Edd, of Lyanna Mormont. You could have done more. It is the guilt of the survivors. \u201cWe can\u2019t save everyone,\u201d you tell her. With the thumb you stroke the corner of her mouth. \u201cBut to know it, don\u2019t prevent us from trying.\u201d</p><p>Sansa sighs and turns her face against your hand, like a flower in search of the warmth of the sun. You open your hand and rest it against her cheek and when she touches the inside of your wrist with her lips, time seems to stop for both of you, freezing. Now you finally notice it. The shortness of her breathing, her pupils dilated, the way her eyes darted towards your mouth. Oh. The temptation is irresistible.</p><p>You know what\u2019s going to happen. You should be ashamed, you should think it\u2019s wrong. Sansa is your sister. But she isn\u2019t. She is your cousin and it is such a convenient solution to know that you could kiss her, that in the eyes of the gods it wouldn\u2019t be an abomination. You\u2019re about to do it, but then someone knocks at the door.</p><p>*</p><p>Someone knocks at the door. You look at each other, you and Jon, and the tension cracks until it breaks.</p><p>You invite to enter. You already have a vague idea of \u200b\u200bwho it may be so it doesn\u2019t surprise you when Brienne\u2019s blonde head peeps out. \u201cI came to bid you a good night, my lady. If you don\u2019t need me anymore-\u201d</p><p>You observe the moment when she realizes that you are not alone. Her eyes widen and her eyebrows shoot upward. \u201cMy apologies,\u201d she says in a tone that would make other girls blush. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t interrupt you.\u201d</p><p>The proximity of your bodies, Jon\u2019s hand still lingering on your neck. Or maybe you have become paranoid and the naked astonishment is simply due to the dagger you are still holding.</p><p>\u201cWe had finished,\u201d you hear Jon say.</p><p>You want to protest. There is no polite way to confirm that Brienne has indeed disturbed you and that she interrupted\u2026 whatever she interrupted. He must sense your disappointment because he smiles at you, warm and reassuring, forming crinkles at the edges of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe will talk another time,\u201d he says with the tone of a promise and for a moment he seems to want to add more, but Brienne\u2019s presence holds him back. Your heart makes a flip. You feel the cheeks warm and you have never been so acutely aware of your body, in all its parts. You try to convince yourself that there is nothing inappropriate.</p><p>When he kisses your forehead, just above the eyebrow, you can\u2019t help but compare the gesture with the affection of another brother. Robb would never have done it, not with this tenderness, with so much longing.</p><p>Oh. <i>Oh</i>.</p><p>It should feel wrong. You don\u2019t care.</p><p>The adoration and desire in Jon\u2019s eyes\u2026 Your cousin.</p><p>You see him leave, his absence already in this noticeable\u00a0wave of sudden cold.</p><p>You can imagine what he wants to talk about. You touch your lips with the tip of the fingers, containing little and badly a broad smile.</p><p><i>You can\u2019t wait</i>.</p>",

This\u00a0is all her doing, entirely her idea. I only gave context and added some descriptions.)</p><p>There is a shamelessly inspired scene from Edward and Winry in FMA</p><p>*</p><p>(Sansa)</p><p>Goes like this. </p><p>The battle is over and you have won. You survived. You should feel happy, relieved. Every time you close your eyes, though, you think back to the heartrending screams of women, the silent crying of children, the rasping sounds of the wights. The smell of blood and rotting flesh, the sour taste of terror in your mouth. The feeling of being once again that impotent little girl, struck by the swords of knights without honor, kneeling on flagstones. Helpless. Powerless.</p><p>Once before, in the past, you experienced this desolation, this discouragement, this rage. You promised yourself that you would never ever allow it to happen again. You thought to be changed, to be different. You lied to yourself.</p><p>You\u2019re stronger, but it\u2019s still not enough.</p><p>*</p><p>When you expose your reasons to Arya, you expect a certain kind of expression, certain words, a particular look. What you didn\u2019t expect is that she reacts as if your request didn\u2019t surprise her at all and on the contrary she considers it completely legitimate.</p><p>Arya urges you to take your dagger and you widen your eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d You ask and feel your hands begin to tremble and sweat. You\u2019re nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Arya replies, unmoved.</p><p>You obey and when you hold it, you feel stupid just like the first time. You know how you must appear in Arya\u2019s eyes. Clumsy and graceless. A part inside you whispers,<i> it serves you right</i>, it's\u00a0as the wind blows. You once laughed with Jeyne at the way Arya seemed to stumble over her feet when she tried to dance. Now it\u2019s your turn.</p><p>You prepare yourself to be criticized, derided and instead get suggestions, advice and constructive criticism expressed with a slightly teasing tone, but not enough to hurt your sensitivity. They help you understand your mistakes.</p><p>And you realize that you have nothing to fear. Because Arya is your family and you are both grown up, learning to accept yourself, to appreciate what you have become.</p><p>You bend your legs and arm in the stance that Arya just showed you. You raise your chin. You can do it.</p><p>*</p><p>(Jon)</p><p>This is how it starts for you.</p><p>You noticed that something has changed in the relationship between Sansa and Arya. You knew it from the moment when instead of teasing her, Arya defended her in the godswood.</p><p>During the days after the battle (they already call it the Long Night and you can understand why. In a sense it seemed interminable.) you have the confirmation of it when you see them sneak over and over again together, disappear inside the fortress or head towards the godswood. At first you don\u2019t mind, even if you notice it. How could you not? Your attention is divided equally between politics and your family.</p><p>The day arrives when curiosity has the upper hand.

(Your father - Ned was younger than you when he lost a father and a brother, he saw his sister die, he fought in the Rebellion.) You tend to forget that you are still young. Sometimes it seems that you are as old as a heart tree, tired as if every battle fought was worth one hundred. And it\u2019s not over yet.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how it feels,\u201d you hear her murmur, so low you wouldn\u2019t have heard it if you weren\u2019t so close. \u201cNot being able to fight. Being forced to hide and hear around you your people, women and children you promised to protect, dying and screaming in terror, knowing you can\u2019t do anything. If only I had been faster, stronger, braver, I could have saved them. Not all of them, but at least a small part. You were right about the battle. I was stupid, but I learn from my mistakes and I don\u2019t intend to commit this one a second time.\u201d</p><p>You understand how she feels. It\u2019s how you feel too thinking of Edd, of Lyanna Mormont. You could have done more. It is the guilt of the survivors. \u201cWe can\u2019t save everyone,\u201d you tell her. With the thumb you stroke the corner of her mouth. \u201cBut to know it, don\u2019t prevent us from trying.\u201d</p><p>Sansa sighs and turns her face against your hand, like a flower in search of the warmth of the sun. You open your hand and rest it against her cheek and when she touches the inside of your wrist with her lips, time seems to stop for both of you, freezing. Now you finally notice it. The shortness of her breathing, her pupils dilated, the way her eyes darted towards your mouth. Oh. The temptation is irresistible.</p><p>You know what\u2019s going to happen. You should be ashamed, you should think it\u2019s wrong. Sansa is your sister. But she isn\u2019t. She is your cousin and it is such a convenient solution to know that you could kiss her, that in the eyes of the gods it wouldn\u2019t be an abomination. You\u2019re about to do it, but then someone knocks at the door.</p><p>*</p><p>Someone knocks at the door. You look at each other, you and Jon, and the tension cracks until it breaks.</p><p>You invite to enter. You already have a vague idea of \u200b\u200bwho it may be so it doesn\u2019t surprise you when Brienne\u2019s blonde head peeps out. \u201cI came to bid you a good night, my lady. If you don\u2019t need me anymore-\u201d</p><p>You observe the moment when she realizes that you are not alone. Her eyes widen and her eyebrows shoot upward. \u201cMy apologies,\u201d she says in a tone that would make other girls blush. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t interrupt you.\u201d</p><p>The proximity of your bodies, Jon\u2019s hand still lingering on your neck. Or maybe you have become paranoid and the naked astonishment is simply due to the dagger you are still holding.</p><p>\u201cWe had finished,\u201d you hear Jon say.</p><p>You want to protest. There is no polite way to confirm that Brienne has indeed disturbed you and that she interrupted\u2026 whatever she interrupted. He must sense your disappointment because he smiles at you, warm and reassuring, forming crinkles at the edges of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe will talk another time,\u201d he says with the tone of a promise and for a moment he seems to want to add more, but Brienne\u2019s presence holds him back. Your heart makes a flip. You feel the cheeks warm and you have never been so acutely aware of your body, in all its parts. You try to convince yourself that there is nothing inappropriate.</p><p>When he kisses your forehead, just above the eyebrow, you can\u2019t help but compare the gesture with the affection of another brother.

You don\u2019t care.</p><p>The adoration and desire in Jon\u2019s eyes\u2026 Your cousin.</p><p>You see him leave, his absence already in this noticeable\u00a0wave of sudden cold.</p><p>You can imagine what he wants to talk about.

                "content": "<p><b>Our future is greater than our past</b></p><p>(Based on a request - very descriptive - I see a couple of days ago, written by reign-of-sapphire. This&nbsp;is all her doing, entirely her idea. I only gave context and added some descriptions.)</p><p>There is a shamelessly inspired scene from Edward and Winry in FMA</p><p>*</p><p>(Sansa)</p><p>Goes like this. </p><p>The battle is over and you have won. You survived. You should feel happy, relieved. Every time you close your eyes, though, you think back to the heartrending screams of women, the silent crying of children, the rasping sounds of the wights. The smell of blood and rotting flesh, the sour taste of terror in your mouth. The feeling of being once again that impotent little girl, struck by the swords of knights without honor, kneeling on flagstones. Helpless. Powerless.</p><p>Once before, in the past, you experienced this desolation, this discouragement, this rage. You promised yourself that you would never ever allow it to happen again. You thought to be changed, to be different. You lied to yourself.</p><p>You&rsquo;re stronger, but it&rsquo;s still not enough.</p><p>*</p><p>When you expose your reasons to Arya, you expect a certain kind of expression, certain words, a particular look. What you didn&rsquo;t expect is that she reacts as if your request didn&rsquo;t surprise her at all and on the contrary she considers it completely legitimate.</p><p>Arya urges you to take your dagger and you widen your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; You ask and feel your hands begin to tremble and sweat. You&rsquo;re nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Arya replies, unmoved.</p><p>You obey and when you hold it, you feel stupid just like the first time. You know how you must appear in Arya&rsquo;s eyes. Clumsy and graceless. A part inside you whispers,<i> it serves you right</i>, it's&nbsp;as the wind blows. You once laughed with Jeyne at the way Arya seemed to stumble over her feet when she tried to dance. Now it&rsquo;s your turn.</p><p>You prepare yourself to be criticized, derided and instead get suggestions, advice and constructive criticism expressed with a slightly teasing tone, but not enough to hurt your sensitivity. They help you understand your mistakes.</p><p>And you realize that you have nothing to fear. Because Arya is your family and you are both grown up, learning to accept yourself, to appreciate what you have become.</p><p>You bend your legs and arm in the stance that Arya just showed you. You raise your chin. You can do it.</p><p>*</p><p>(Jon)</p><p>This is how it starts for you.</p><p>You noticed that something has changed in the relationship between Sansa and Arya. You knew it from the moment when instead of teasing her, Arya defended her in the godswood.</p><p>During the days after the battle (they already call it the Long Night and you can understand why. In a sense it seemed interminable.) you have the confirmation of it when you see them sneak over and over again together, disappear inside the fortress or head towards the godswood. At first you don&rsquo;t mind, even if you notice it. How could you not? Your attention is divided equally between politics and your family.</p><p>The day arrives when curiosity has the upper hand. Strangely, you are alone. What&rsquo;s the harm in wanting to know? You follow them.</p><p>You hear them before you see them. Arya is giving orders in a severe but calm and encouraging tone. If you didn&rsquo;t find the idea absurd, you&rsquo;d almost think that -</p><p>You accelerate the pace and finally get the full view. They&rsquo;re in front of the heart tree. Both don&rsquo;t wear cloaks and Sansa has her hair braided backwards in the complicated hairstyle she&rsquo;s been using more and more often lately. You thought it was for vanity. It was foolish&nbsp;of you. Sansa doesn&rsquo;t care about that kind of thing, not anymore. Now you sense your mistake. It was for practicality. That has always been the reason.</p><p>Unseen, hidden behind the trunk of a tree, you look at them. Sansa is clearly inexperienced. Her movements, however graceful, lack precision, rapidity. They are not incisive enough. Her elbow, for example.</p><p>&ldquo;Your elbow is too high,&rdquo; Arya states and approaches to show her the most appropriate angle.</p><p>You stay and it goes on like this for a while. For everything you want to say, every correction, Arya beats you on time.</p><p>Silent as you arrived, you turn around to go back inside. You can recognize when your presence is not necessary.</p><p>*</p><p>That night, your steps lead you to her solar. You don&rsquo;t knock and don&rsquo;t regret it. Sansa&rsquo;s got her back&nbsp;to you. She didn&rsquo;t hear you come in and you enjoy the precious moments before she notices you. She seems so focused. In the privacy of her chambers, her hair is a free and wild waterfall behind her back. The air around her seems to vibrate and crackle with energy, the quiet before the storm.</p><p>She wears that corset that resembles an armor. You regret not be able to see her expression, but you know it must be proud and determined.</p><p>You look at her and you can&rsquo;t help feeling the usual blusterous emotions. For once you don&rsquo;t feel guilty. </p><p>She&rsquo;s so beautiful that it breaks your heart, but Sansa isn&rsquo;t just her pretty face. She is the insight into hard eyes, the sharpness of a piercing mind, the ability to listen and be listened, the value she gives to every word because she believes that they are lethal weapons just like any sword. She is not a warrior, but her fighting spirit rivals that of the best soldiers. You look at her with your arms crossed over your chest.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too stiff,&rdquo; you comments without being able to hold back any further. You immediately regret it. If she was composed first, now her back appears to be carved in stone. You observe the change and when she turns with a lightning movement, red hair like a comet&rsquo;s fiery trail, her face is frowning and irritated. Whether it is with you or with herself, because she didn&rsquo;t hear you, you can&rsquo;t understand.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been there spying on me?&rdquo; She asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I was simply offering some constructive criticism.&rdquo; You used a joking tone, but her reaction is instantaneous and you understand that you said the wrong thing.</p><p>She lowers her eyes, and so the arm holding the dagger against her side. She bites her lip from embarrassment and frustration.</p><p>Before you can say you&rsquo;re sorry and you didn&rsquo;t mean it, not in the way you said it at least, she surprises you. &ldquo;You could show me,&rdquo; she says and crosses your gaze steadily.</p><p>You nod, unable to put into words what you are thinking. She is asking for your help and you would like to be a better man and not feel this mixture of pride and happiness. With Sansa everything seems easy and goddamn complicated, even the smallest and most innocent things. You clear your throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; you murmur and detach yourself from the wall on which you were leaning. You move, carrying yourself behind her and if you are closer than strictly necessary, it is a secret that you will take to your grave. (You don&rsquo;t notice how her pupils are dilated, her flared nostrils. If you notice the redness on her cheeks, you connect it to physical exertion. You know nothing. Even today.)</p><p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; You inquire before touching her.</p><p>Sansa gives you a look that you can&rsquo;t figure out, but nods.</p><p>You place one hand on her hip, with the other you guide the movement of her arm. Meanwhile you bend to inhale the ladylike and rich scent of her skin, something sweet and acrid in the oxymoron that Sansa represents. You feel like a lost man, damned. You don&rsquo;t care. If the price you have to pay for being with her is this torment, you prefer it. You have been away for months and it was an agonizing experience.</p><p>After you&rsquo;ve shown her how to move, you bring yourself in front of her and point out where to hit. Closed in its sheath, the dagger touches you under the jugular, against the chest, in the stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good dagger,&rdquo; you say, observing how the handle seems made for her long,&nbsp;tapered&nbsp;hand. It fits perfectly.</p><p>&ldquo;Arya gave it to me during the battle.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Did you use it?</i> You would like to ask her. The chance are high.</p><p>&ldquo;Stick them with&nbsp;the pointy end.&rdquo; Sansa is looking at you sideways. &ldquo;It was the advice that Arya gave me. Her first lesson.&rdquo;</p><p>You would like to burst out laughing, confide to her that you were the one to say that first. Instead you listen to her labored breathing and the laughter dies in your throat, assuages like steam, like breath in the coldness of the night. &ldquo;It saved me. If I hadn&rsquo;t had this dagger, I&rsquo;d probably be dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Your grip on her becomes ironclad. To imagine her defenseless and alone in the crypts, surrounded by wights. You tried not to think about it. But now you are and your blood is freezing. You have been so close to losing her.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; you admit and you find reflected in her shiny eyes the same liquid turmoil that shakes you to the bone, the courage born out of fear to not surviving, the strength of despair. And now confusion. She doesn&rsquo;t understand and why should she? Sometimes you can&rsquo;t understand yourself. The depth of feelings towards her is beyond all understanding and reason.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; you repeat, surrounding her waist and resting your forehead against hers. You are the same height, nose to nose, eyes to eyes. If you only could (not if you only wanted to. You know you want it. You want it like you wanted a few other things in your life. Knowing the truth about your mother. Being a Stark), you could touch her mouth with yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo;</p><p>You hear the question in her voice. You hate the idea of &#8203;&#8203;her at the mercy of events, especially because it sounds so wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;Your hands,&rdquo; you begin. You want to explain how it is for you, what it means. To understand her need in learning to defend herself and at the same time to feel like a failure. She shouldn&rsquo;t have to do it. It is the proof that you didn&rsquo;t protect her as you should have. Furthermore you are terrified she&rsquo;s going to end up in&nbsp;combat.</p><p>&ldquo;Your hands aren&rsquo;t meant to kill.&rdquo;</p><p>You see her scowl, blinking rapidly. Her eyelashes are dark and long, casting palpitating shadows against her cheekbones.</p><p>&ldquo;Not even to save,&rdquo; she says bitterly, with self-deprecation. &ldquo;I want to be useful.&rdquo; There is something petulant in the way she said it, ardent and hurt in her expression. <i>I am not useless, worthless or weak</i>, it&rsquo;s implied. You want to reassure her that if you react in this way it is precisely for the opposite reason. Suddenly she looks young and vulnerable.</p><p>It is rare to remember how young she is, how young all of you are.

        "answer": "<p>It seems absolutely ridiculous, but her nerves are shot, her ancestors clawed their way out of the tombs they had been placed in, and she is so wired that Sansa Stark doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019ll ever sleep again. But that\u2019s fine, she\u2019s used to sleepless nights. She pulls out a long-forgotten needlepoint, threads her needle by the fire roaring, and begins to spear her fabric without thought.</p><p>She wishes that fighting had come that easily to her. That she could have done more in the crypts, that she could have used Arya\u2019s gift with the same kind of precision as her needles.\u00a0</p><p>She doesn\u2019t bother to look up when Jon finally comes stumbling in, shaking the snow from his hair, absent one queen. Good. There\u2019s no part of Sansa that wishes to play hostess right now. Her brother pulls up a chair beside her, one of the only ones not broken from when the dead got into the manor. He shucks off his gloves and lets them fall to the floor. He smells of blood.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you start that particular piece before I left?\u201d he asks her, voice so quiet, it could get lost in the wind.\u00a0<br/></p><p>She glances at him quickly, hands still moving.\u00a0\u201cThere were other matters to attend to besides foolish girl\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>Half a wolf fills her fabric, and she intends to now add all of them. The dead, the living. It\u2019s the pack, hers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou leaving, Arya and Bran returning, the replacement of Littlefinger,\u201d Sansa continues.\u00a0\u201cFeeding the people, homing them.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI should have been here,\u201d Jon says.<br/></p><p>She isn\u2019t sure for which part he means, but she agrees. Her smile is thin as she turns to him, chin tilted.\u00a0\u201cYou never listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI listen. I\u2019m just as stubborn as you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t need him,\u201d another voice chimes in. Arya moves like a ghost now, but Sansa has learned to stop being startled by it.\u00a0\u201cHe would have been too noble about Littlefinger.\u201d<br/></p><p>She sits next to Sansa on the floor, her head resting against Sansa\u2019s knee. She also smells of blood and dirt and sweat. A million years ago, this never would have happened. Arya wouldn\u2019t have come this close to Sansa, and Sansa would have been too nervous about her clothes being dirtied or if Arya was up to her no good tricks. Now, she takes comfort in having her sister with her again.</p><p>Jon leans forward in his chair to look at her.\u00a0\u201cPageantry isn\u2019t my style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Father\u2019s either, but I\u2019m sure he would have enjoyed it all the same,\u201d Sansa quips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI enjoyed it. Fewer names to repeat at night.\u201d<br/></p><p>Sansa doesn\u2019t say anything about that, and Jon thankfully doesn\u2019t either. He\u2019s leaned back in his chair again, head tilted up to look at the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>The siblings are quiet. She keeps stitching, nice and neat little lines that make sense. A foolish girl\u2019s pride and joy, but there\u2019s still bits and pieces of her inside. Somewhere deep, where the darkness can\u2019t touch her. Needlepoint makes her think of her mother, and the comfort of being in her arms.\u00a0</p><p>She should have never left home.</p><p>Never left her mother or her sister or her brothers.\u00a0</p><p>There are things that can\u2019t ever quite be changed, though.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs Bran alright?\u201d Sansa breaks the silence that settled over them as peacefully as snow.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDefine what you mean by alright,\u201d Arya replies.<br/></p><p>That\u2019s - a fair point.

        "question": "Do you think that the Sansa-Shae relationship was suppose to be a contrast between the Daenerys-Missandei relationship? On the surface, they are both future queen-handmaid friendships, but the dynamics are so different. Sansa treated Shae like an equal and there was a real sisterly bond between them. Shae also had no fear telling Sansa how she truly felt. On the other hand, Daenerys still treats Missandei like her servant, and Missi thinks she has to worship her like a perfect goddess.",
        "answer": "<p>Hello!</p><p>I\u2019m not sure, nonny. But there is definitely room for comparison when looking at the 2 friendships and what sets Daenerys and Missandei\u2019s relationship apart from Sansa\u2019s and Shae\u2019s. </p><p>For starters I think the biggest difference between the two is the power imbalance and the problematic beginning of Daenerys and Missandei\u2019s relationship. She takes Missandei from Kraznys as a \u201cgift\u201d from him to her on their agreed upon deal of 1 dragon. Don\u2019t get me wrong at all, Missandei is 100 times better off with Daenerys than she was with Kraznys but it remains the same that at first her master changes from him to Daenerys. When they are talking privately Daenerys tells her that she may starve and even die because she\u2019s taking her into war. She has no real choice in this situation and only answers in \u201cValar Morghulis\u201d because up until this point she\u2019s only been taught to obey and what can she realistically do here? </p><p>With Sansa and Shae their relationship starts out rocky when she\u2019s assigned a new haindmaiden one night after coming back to a horrible dinner with Cersei and her children where she was emotionally tortured to remain calm and look as happy as she could in that situation. Sansa snaps at her and it doesn\u2019t look to be going well. \n\nBut with both relationships they grow in trust and a bond that cannot be denied. \n\nMissandei obviously trusts Daenerys and does believe in her as a person. She\u2019s starting to see a life outside of her wars and she\u2019s found love in the process. Daenerys considers Missandei a true friend as we see them talk about Grey Worm and going as far of Daenerys asking Missandei for counsel.\n\nSansa and Shae grow a bond that gives off an older sister vibe with Shae willing to kill for Sansa and do everything in her power to protect her. (Like trying to help her hide her period etc) Gives her advise and Sansa trust Shae completely to the point of speaking treason about Joffery knowing that she\u2019s safe in her words around her. \n\nHowever, while watching their scenes together I think there\u2019s something more genuine, more real about Sansa and Shae\u2019s relationship. Missandei and Daenerys have had plenty of scenes together but there\u2019s always a power imbalance that keeps them from truly connecting as equals. We even have a deleted scene of Missandei coming to Daenerys after she sends Jorah away and Daenerys tells Missandei \u201cNever betray me.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to be reminded Daenerys is Missndei\u2019s superior no matter the importance of their friendship. \n\nWith Sansa and Shae their scenes have had moments that go beyond that of service and loyalty. Shae is always trying to protect Sansa and talks to her more plainly. When it comes to Littefinger, after the riot, and Joffery. There\u2019s moments I forget she is Sansa\u2019s handmaiden because she\u2019s not afraid to speak her mind and is blunt when needed. \n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think they are necessarily meant to contrast one another in comparison but what I take from the major differences is Sansa\u2019s relationship with Shae feels more human while with Daenerys she is isolated at the top and alone stands as everyone\u2019s queen at the end of the day. </p>",

        "body": "<p>A couple hours ago I was looking for a quote from season 7, and I came across something interesting that has had me snickering ever since and I thought I ought to share it with y\u2019all.</p><p>Littlefinger\u2019s always been a cautious man, right? He\u2019s always played a very long, very slow game. And yet, he started rushing his manipulation of Sansa in season 7. Why?</p><h2>Because Tyrion is alive and back in Westeros.</h2><p>I\u2019ll backtrack a little first. Skimming through Sansa and Tyrion\u2019s chapters in the first 3 books makes it very apparent that Littlefinger controls Sansa\u2019s life from the moment she steps foot in Kings Landing. He\u2019s the one who caused the entire conflict between the Lannisters and the Starks, because he wanted Cat and couldn\u2019t have her. He could have her daughter, however. So Ned Stark gets killed off, and she\u2019s suddenly a Lannister hostage. Then he convinces the Lannisters to end her engagement with Joffrey, but then the Tyrells try to marry her off to their eldest son, and who\u2019s the one who tells Tywin Lannister? Littlefinger. Then she\u2019s married off to Tyrion Lannister and who\u2019s the one who ensures she runs away from that marriage? Littlefinger.</p><p>Outside Tyrion\u2019s chambers the two people in charge of Sansa\u2019s life are Tywin Lannister and Littlefinger. She has no power and no influence, and every time somebody shows her a kindness or attempts to take her outside Littlefinger\u2019s reach something happens to hinder those plans.</p><p>Because Sansa is Catelyn in Littlefinger\u2019s eyes. She\u2019s just younger, richer, more beautiful and more fertile \u2014and it\u2019s disgusting AF.</p><p>She\u2019s also more easily manipulated.</p><p>Until, of course, he betrays her to Ramsey and she suddenly doesn\u2019t trust her very much.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter, really, because she was raped and she\u2019s unlikely to just take another man again (especially when the last one had his face bitten off by his own dogs on her command) so he\u2019s got time. Lots of time. To slowly get under her skin and to isolate her from the people who love her.</p><!-- more --><p>And then, suddenly, Jon Snow gets a pair of raven scrolls.</p><p>In episode 2 of season 7 Jon reveals that he\u2019s received a scroll from Sam in Oldtown and one from Tyrion Lannister.</p><p>Sam\u2019s letter reveals that Dragonstone (the Targeryen stronghold) sits on a mountain of dragon glass, which the North needs. But Dragonstone is currently occupied by the dragon queen. Which is where Tyrion\u2019s scroll comes in.</p><p>This is a message Jon hadn\u2019t revealed to anybody he\u2019d received, and as soon as he does we get two reactions:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1093\" data-orig-height=\"569\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/46d8d17f2ccba5834bf0ba26a1647647/tumblr_inline_pqy3updpFF1t7n4eg_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1093\" data-orig-height=\"569\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1100\" data-orig-height=\"570\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/90ad468d8815b2395b66af2272ff82db/tumblr_inline_pqy3uthQgB1t7n4eg_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1100\" data-orig-height=\"570\"/></figure><p>Sansa smiles very subtly before she can school her expression. And littlefinger draws physically back.</p><p>This is most likely the first news anybody has had in months (maybe years) of Tyrion being alive. And now he\u2019s back in Westeros. To Sansa this is pleasing news, to Littlefinger this is not.</p><p>If Jon Snow is successful, after all. It means that Tyrion Lannister will follow his queen north and there he and Sansa would be reunited. And even if there is no love between them, that doesn\u2019t change the way they interacted in Kings Landing. Sansa might have been a prisoner, but there are scenes and instances that shows how much she valued his words and trusted him. Even after Littlefinger had managed to separate them, she\u2019d still always defended him and spoken well of him.</p><p>Now he\u2019s slowly coming back into her life and Littlefinger is shitting himself. How do I know?</p><p>Because immediately afterwards he goes to Jon and reveals his intentions towards Sansa. The first words out of his mouth are there to remind Jon of Tyrion\u2019s involvement in Ned Stark\u2019s death, after which he tries to connect with Jon over his parents and praising him. And then reminding Jon that Jon is in his debt, most likely assuming that an honourable man like Jon snow will pay his debts no matter the cost. That cost, of course, being Sansa.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say it outright, but I\u2019m fairly sure he came down into the crypts to ask for Sansa\u2019s hand in marriage. Why else would he begin to confess his love for her if it was not because he wanted something?</p><p>Only, of course, Jon doesn\u2019t play that game, and so Littlefinger gets an enemy instead of a marriage.</p><p>After which he changes tactics: he tries to make Sansa paranoid, to trust nobody, to always expect the worst in people. He tries to get between herself and her family. Only once does he attempt the same strategy, of connecting with a perceived Lord Stark (Bran), only to have Bran refute him.</p><p>For every step he takes, he underestimates the Starks and their mentality. He doesn\u2019t know that female wolves have the same power as the male ones, and he doesn\u2019t take his time to do his research, to know the way Starks think differently that southern lords, how they rally to their leader, the way they protect her. He doesn\u2019t have the time to do that.</p><p>He\u2019s on a deadline.</p><p>And this is what amuses me so much. Because, if romance isn\u2019t in the game (as it rarely is), then I can only think of two reasons why Littlefinger is terrified of Sansa and Tyrion reuniting.</p><p>One is, of course, the Imp\u2019s protectiveness of Sansa. This is a man who\u2019s publicly threatened a king more than once in order to keep his little wife safe, and some of those threats weren\u2019t even uttered while she was officially under his protection.</p><p>(Though my two favorites are definitely the ones that come after their marriage:)</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion: There will be no bedding ceremony</p><p>Joffrey: There will be if I command it.</p><p>Tyrion, slamming a knife into the table: Then you\u2019ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"567\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/899a912a8eec48c4bd4be86edc26156b/tumblr_inline_pqy3wdnNwk1t7n4eg_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"567\"/></figure><p>What I love particularly about this scene the way they portrayed it in the movie, is that the knife cuts cleanly between Sansa and Joffrey, and thus Tyrion in his rage is cutting their connection cleanly in two, separating them forever. Tyrion, after all, knows exactly how cruel Joffrey has been to Sansa, how he\u2019s had her beaten, stripped and humiliated in public, and I highly doubt he didn\u2019t hear Joffrey threatening to rape her, given that they were standing right above him when he said it. Tyrion might not think of himself as kind, but he\u2019s always been outraged by Joffrey\u2019s actions, and at the very first opportunity he makes sure Joffrey knows he can no longer torment her.</p><p>Which is most likely the other reason Joffrey is so gleeful when he finds out Robb is dead:</p><blockquote><p>Joffrey: Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service, and command him to send Robb Stark\u2019s head. I\u2019m going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.</p><p>(\u2026)</p><p>Tyrion: No. She is no longer yours to torment.</p><p>Joffrey: Everyone is mine to torment. You\u2019d do well to remember that, you little monster.</p><p>Tyrion: Oh, I\u2019m a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1096\" data-orig-height=\"570\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c2b13a8d15b8cdab78ba20247686b52/tumblr_inline_pqy3wyy3BN1t7n4eg_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1096\" data-orig-height=\"570\"/></figure><p>Tyrion might not be a great warrior like a lot of the other characters in the show, but he\u2019s felt powerless enough when it comes to Sansa\u2019s circumstances, and furious enough that he\u2019s forced to play a part in her imprisonment, that Littlefinger continuing that imprisonment when she should finally have been free (and selling her to a rapist) is going to earn Lord Baelish a very painful gutting.</p><p>The second, more likely reason that Littlefinger is terrified of Sansa and Tyrion reuniting is, of course, that the moment they are she\u2019s no longer going to listen to his council. Sansa isn\u2019t stupid and Baelish knows this. He sold her to a rapist and she will never forgive him that. And she isn\u2019t going to need his power in the Vale anymore either. He\u2019s expendable. And Tyrion\u2019s presence is only going to make that even more apparent. Tyrion, whom Sansa continues to speak of with high regard, as clever and kind and good.</p><p>Of course, what is Littlefinger\u2019s greatest mistake in his rush to own Sansa, is underestimating Sansa Stark as she is. He assumes that just because Bran has returned she is no longer Queen in the North. He assumes that she needs another man\u2019s presence in her life to realize she doesn\u2019t need Baelish. He assumes she can be turned from her female relations and companions. Littlefinger\u2019s greatest mistake was thinking of Sansa as \u201conly\u201d a woman. And thus he underestimated what she is capable of, all on her own.</p><p>But what strikes me the most about all of this, is that Petyr Baelish, the greatest master of manipulation in Westeros, feared the combined powers that would come from a political alliance between Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark, not because of their land or their titles, but because of their trust in each other and their combined intelligence.</p>",

Sansa might have been a prisoner, but there are scenes and instances that shows how much she valued his words and trusted him.

How do I know?</p><p>Because immediately afterwards he goes to Jon and reveals his intentions towards Sansa. The first words out of his mouth are there to remind Jon of Tyrion\u2019s involvement in Ned Stark\u2019s death, after which he tries to connect with Jon over his parents and praising him. And then reminding Jon that Jon is in his debt, most likely assuming that an honourable man like Jon snow will pay his debts no matter the cost. That cost, of course, being Sansa.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say it outright, but I\u2019m fairly sure he came down into the crypts to ask for Sansa\u2019s hand in marriage. Why else would he begin to confess his love for her if it was not because he wanted something?</p><p>Only, of course, Jon doesn\u2019t play that game, and so Littlefinger gets an enemy instead of a marriage.</p><p>After which he changes tactics: he tries to make Sansa paranoid, to trust nobody, to always expect the worst in people. He tries to get between herself and her family. Only once does he attempt the same strategy, of connecting with a perceived Lord Stark (Bran), only to have Bran refute him.</p><p>For every step he takes, he underestimates the Starks and their mentality. He doesn\u2019t know that female wolves have the same power as the male ones, and he doesn\u2019t take his time to do his research, to know the way Starks think differently that southern lords, how they rally to their leader, the way they protect her.

Because, if romance isn\u2019t in the game (as it rarely is), then I can only think of two reasons why Littlefinger is terrified of Sansa and Tyrion reuniting.</p><p>One is, of course, the Imp\u2019s protectiveness of Sansa. This is a man who\u2019s publicly threatened a king more than once in order to keep his little wife safe, and some of those threats weren\u2019t even uttered while she was officially under his protection.</p><p>(Though my two favorites are definitely the ones that come after their marriage:)</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion: There will be no bedding ceremony</p><p>Joffrey: There will be if I command it.</p><p>Tyrion, slamming a knife into the table: Then you\u2019ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"567\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/899a912a8eec48c4bd4be86edc26156b/tumblr_inline_pqy3wdnNwk1t7n4eg_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1083\" data-orig-height=\"567\"></figure><p>What I love particularly about this scene the way they portrayed it in the movie, is that the knife cuts cleanly between Sansa and Joffrey, and thus Tyrion in his rage is cutting their connection cleanly in two, separating them forever. Tyrion, after all, knows exactly how cruel Joffrey has been to Sansa, how he\u2019s had her beaten, stripped and humiliated in public, and I highly doubt he didn\u2019t hear Joffrey threatening to rape her, given that they were standing right above him when he said it. Tyrion might not think of himself as kind, but he\u2019s always been outraged by Joffrey\u2019s actions, and at the very first opportunity he makes sure Joffrey knows he can no longer torment her.</p><p>Which is most likely the other reason Joffrey is so gleeful when he finds out Robb is dead:</p><blockquote><p>Joffrey: Write back to Lord Frey.

Sansa isn\u2019t stupid and Baelish knows this. He sold her to a rapist and she will never forgive him that. And she isn\u2019t going to need his power in the Vale anymore either. He\u2019s expendable. And Tyrion\u2019s presence is only going to make that even more apparent. Tyrion, whom Sansa continues to speak of with high regard, as clever and kind and good.</p><p>Of course, what is Littlefinger\u2019s greatest mistake in his rush to own Sansa, is underestimating Sansa Stark as she is. He assumes that just because Bran has returned she is no longer Queen in the North. He assumes that she needs another man\u2019s presence in her life to realize she doesn\u2019t need Baelish. He assumes she can be turned from her female relations and companions. Littlefinger\u2019s greatest mistake was thinking of Sansa as \u201conly\u201d a woman. And thus he underestimated what she is capable of, all on her own.</p><p>But what strikes me the most about all of this, is that Petyr Baelish, the greatest master of manipulation in Westeros, feared the combined powers that would come from a political alliance between Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark, not because of their land or their titles, but because of their trust in each other and their combined intelligence.</p>",
