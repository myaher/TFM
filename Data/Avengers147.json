The stories are automatically posted here from the AO3 RSS feed using an IFTTT recipe, but this was made easy thanks to astolat (astolat.tumblr.com). If you would like to set up a similar blog, see the instructions tab :) To check announcements regarding these blogs, go to the tumblr tag #ao3feed announcement. (moderated by enjolbutt.tumblr.com) I hope this blog helps when you are in dire need of feels or a laugh, so enjoy! :)",

When they spotted you, Wanda offered,\u00a0\u201c(Y/n)! Want to try what we made?\u201d You nodded as Vision handed you a sample.</p><p>Before you took a bite, you joked,\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t die from this, right?\u201d As you looked at Vision. The android\u00a0gulped nervously,\u00a0\u201cI certainly hope not.\u201d You laughed,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just joking, Vision.\u201d</p><p>When you tried the food, your taste buds felt blessed.\u00a0\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d You complimented with widened eyes. Wanda and Vision looked at you with grins on their faces, relieved and proud of their work. Vision stated,\u00a0\u201cWanda did do most of the work.\u201d You noticed Wanda\u2019s cheeks started to grow pink and you couldn\u2019t help but smile at the couple.</p><p>-</p><p>Shortly after, you exited the kitchen to see Steve enter the room while carrying a huge Christmas tree over his shoulder. Behind him, Bucky and Sam were carrying boxes of Christmas decorations.</p><p>Steve placed the tree in the corner of the room and you made your way there to see if they needed any help.</p><p>\u201cHey guys, need any help?\u201d You asked cheerfully. Bucky smiled,\u00a0\u201cYou can help us hang the Christmas ornaments on the tree.\u201d You nodded as Sam opened a box that was filled with ornaments.\u00a0</p><p>The four of you started hanging the ornaments on the tree while stories and jokes were being shared. When you wanted to put the star at the top of the tree, you realised that you were way too short. You still couldn\u2019t reach the top when you tip-toed.\u00a0</p><p>Upon noticing this, Steve lifted you up and placed you on his shoulder gently. When he did so, you let out a yelp in surprise. However, this allowed you to place the star on the tip of the tree.\u00a0</p><p>After Steve placed you back on the ground gently, you looked at the tree and you were already starting to get the Christmas vibe of the room as you inhaled the smell of pine from the tree.</p><p>After you were done, Steve said,\u00a0\u201c(Y/n), will you please bring this box to Peter?\u201d As he handed you an unopened box.\u00a0You nodded in agreement as you saw Peter inside the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>You brought the box to Peter and said,\u00a0\u201cHey Peter, Cap told me to pass this box to you.\u201d Peter smiled widely as he took the box from you and opened it, revealing Christmas lights.\u00a0\u201cThank you so much!\u201d Peter grinned but suddenly, he smile faltered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You questioned. Peter pouted,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t hang all of these lights alone.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but laugh slightly at Peter\u2019s adorableness and you offered,\u00a0\u201cDo you want some help?\u201d Peter\u2019s face brightened once more,\u00a0\u201cReally?! You\u2019ll help me?\u201d You nodded at the male and he started cheering.</p><p>Peter skipped out of the kitchen and you followed.

When they spotted you, Wanda offered,&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/n)! Want to try what we made?&rdquo; You nodded as Vision handed you a sample.</p><p>Before you took a bite, you joked,&nbsp;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t die from this, right?&rdquo; As you looked at Vision. The android&nbsp;gulped nervously,&nbsp;&ldquo;I certainly hope not.&rdquo; You laughed,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just joking, Vision.&rdquo;</p><p>When you tried the food, your taste buds felt blessed.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is amazing!&rdquo; You complimented with widened eyes. Wanda and Vision looked at you with grins on their faces, relieved and proud of their work. Vision stated,&nbsp;&ldquo;Wanda did do most of the work.&rdquo; You noticed Wanda&rsquo;s cheeks started to grow pink and you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the couple.</p><p>-</p><p>Shortly after, you exited the kitchen to see Steve enter the room while carrying a huge Christmas tree over his shoulder. Behind him, Bucky and Sam were carrying boxes of Christmas decorations.</p><p>Steve placed the tree in the corner of the room and you made your way there to see if they needed any help.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys, need any help?&rdquo; You asked cheerfully. Bucky smiled,&nbsp;&ldquo;You can help us hang the Christmas ornaments on the tree.&rdquo; You nodded as Sam opened a box that was filled with ornaments.&nbsp;</p><p>The four of you started hanging the ornaments on the tree while stories and jokes were being shared. When you wanted to put the star at the top of the tree, you realised that you were way too short. You still couldn&rsquo;t reach the top when you tip-toed.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon noticing this, Steve lifted you up and placed you on his shoulder gently. When he did so, you let out a yelp in surprise. However, this allowed you to place the star on the tip of the tree.&nbsp;</p><p>After Steve placed you back on the ground gently, you looked at the tree and you were already starting to get the Christmas vibe of the room as you inhaled the smell of pine from the tree.</p><p>After you were done, Steve said,&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/n), will you please bring this box to Peter?&rdquo; As he handed you an unopened box.&nbsp;You nodded in agreement as you saw Peter inside the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>You brought the box to Peter and said,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Peter, Cap told me to pass this box to you.&rdquo; Peter smiled widely as he took the box from you and opened it, revealing Christmas lights.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you so much!&rdquo; Peter grinned but suddenly, he smile faltered.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; You questioned. Peter pouted,&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hang all of these lights alone.&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh slightly at Peter&rsquo;s adorableness and you offered,&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want some help?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s face brightened once more,&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?! You&rsquo;ll help me?&rdquo; You nodded at the male and he started cheering.</p><p>Peter skipped out of the kitchen and you followed. The both of you started hanging the lights all around the room but none of you were sure how it would look. Yours&rsquo; and Peter&rsquo;s laughter filled the entire room as you and Peter took turns to wrap each other with the lights, instead of hanging them.</p><p>When you finished, you and Peter took a step back to admire your work.&nbsp;&ldquo;We did amazing!&rdquo; Peter said in astonishment. You replied,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; You were honestly quite surprised by how well the end product turned out as you and Peter were just playing around.</p><p>-</p><p>Peter thanked you once more and the boh of you turned around to see Bruce, Natasha, and Clint sitting by the Christmas tree, placing the presents under the tree.</p><p>You and Peter made your way to the three of them and Clint immediately noticed the both of you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey guys, come and help us! We have a lot of gifts here.&rdquo; You sat down and Peter followed after,&nbsp;you then noticed the tall and large stack of gifts at the side. You gasped, remembering that you were so busy, you completely forgot about getting presents.</p><p>Natasha heard your gasp and she smiled, &ldquo;There are enough presents from everyone. Don&rsquo;t worry, most of us didn&rsquo;t get the time to buy Christmas presents either.&rdquo; You heaved a sigh of relief at her words and you made a mental note to remind yourself to get gifts next year.</p><p>You spent a few minutes talking to all of them when Bruce pointed out,&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s&nbsp;quite lonely.&rdquo; All of you looked at where Bruce was looking at to see Tony standing by the bar, mixing some drinks.&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>You decided to get up and made your way to accompany Tony. You stood beside the billionaire and asked,&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there any alcohol in there?&rdquo; Tony chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo;Unfortunately no, we have kids here.&rdquo; He looked up to the group by the Christmas tree and you knew that he was talking about Peter since he was still rather childish.</p><p>The both of you started talking about how each of you used the celebrate Christmas, you actually learnt quite a few things about Tony since you had never really gotten a lot of chances to talk to him, much less know more about him.</p><p>Suddenly, you heard a bang from the level above you. Tony sighed,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the library, (Y/n), can you go check what is going?&rdquo;</p><p>Without saying anything, you made your way to the library, curious as to what made that noise.</p><p>-</p><p>You entered the room and saw Loki facepalming and Thor was staring at the pile of books on the floor. Loki sighed,&nbsp;&ldquo;Brother, you can&rsquo;t just do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You took a few steps towards them and asked,&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Thor shot his head up at the sound of your voice and explained,&nbsp;&ldquo;I apologise, (Y/n), we was just trying to read up on Christmas traditions since we don&rsquo;t really know much about them despite being on Midgard for a while now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You smiled at Thor&rsquo;s interest in the holiday and you said,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are any books about Christmas here, but&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t mind sharing more about the holidays.&rdquo; Loki smiled slightly,&nbsp;&ldquo;That would be lovely, thank you, (Y/n).&rdquo;</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, you were in the library telling Thor and Loki stories about Christmas and the traditions.
