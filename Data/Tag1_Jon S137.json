Part of the fandom already saw a little resemblance between young Georgie with Kit's appearence, both Jon and George have a kink for redheads, and on the surface Jon seems like a typical Gary Stue, but I don't know... I kinda see why people might say that, but I'm not entirely sure. What do you think?  It is clear that George self inserts in Jon (at least a little), which I find personally, cute? Not even a great author like GRRM can escape that tendency...",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>definitely not. For once, although the ressemblance of young George with Kit is there, this particular post is a crackpost. I would remind you that BookJon has no ressemblance to George, even to young George. His face is long and stern, and he has no curls. Here is a picture from a calendar of ice and fire (sorry for the bad quality). <br/></p><figure data-orig-height=\"120\" data-orig-width=\"120\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/520ed70dbbf4f3982e1e2009c8f8d857/tumblr_inline_pmrv0sqTbd1uyjf91_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"120\" data-orig-width=\"120\"/></figure><p>and here is a link to the art by amoka (<a href=\"https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/File:Amokajonsnow.jpg\">x</a>), which shows pretty much how Jon looks like in the books. So, sry, not sry, George does not look like Jon, and he himself said that if he is anyone he is Samwell Tarly&hellip; (<a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2017/7/24/16077736/sam-tarly-george-rr-martin-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-game-of-thrones-ac9f3c6721d6\">x</a>), bookloving, fat Samwell Tarly.<br/></p><p>You know, it is funny that young George has a resemblance to Kit, but this does not prove anything, least of all that Jon is a Gary Stue.</p><p>Honestly, - and this is not directed at you, nonny - people should learn to seperate what is an actual argument (for instance quotes and foreshadowing from the books or the show) and what is crack and funny coincidence. I mean GRRM could not possibly know that Kit Harrington would play his Jon Snow when he published his first book in 1993&hellip;. <br/></p><p>You know that is the same kind of argument that is used by Da\u20acnerys stans: GRRM\u2019s family lost their fortune and house and as a child he had the feeling that he was robbed, and therefore he could not write anything else but a Targ restoration. Honestly? This is not how writing and literature works.</p><p>Yes, of course writers let their own experience flow into the writing, but good writers transcend this and I sincerely doubt that GRRM self-inserts very much into any of his characters. I would just alert you to the fact that he has several very different female characters that are all great and believable in their own way - the only part he does not get is female friendship, but so be it, otherwise the range of his women is spectacular. <br/></p><p>So, I wouldn\u2019t say GRRM self-inserts much into Jon apart from maybe channeling some of his experience and feelings into the character, but Jon is not a Gary Stue.</p><p>People say that he has it easy (where, honestly where?) and that he has a plot armour&hellip; But even that is not true. There are several reasons that Jon dies and will be ressurrected and none of them is about plot armour.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to get all riled up about this, in particular because yours was an honest question. So please, bear with me, that I am a bit impatient with Jon ridicule. Jon Snow is my favourite character in the books, and BookJon is smart and clever and a well-fleshed character who has his faults.

While I don't know whether we'll get Jon in Ghost POV, I think we will definitely see a fight between Ghost and Ramsey's dogs.  This is foreshadowed in the first book when Jon gives Ghost half a honeyed chicken, and Ghost fends off a black dog looking to take the chicken.

One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long \nyellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under \nthe bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch \ngrowled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and\n fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry \nchallenge.

GRRM\u2019s question hankers back to the fall-out of war and how rulers choose to handle the different factions that fought in that war. Meaning, how much punishment is to be dealt to the people that fought on the wrong side and how far should a ruler go in order to ensure peace and the healing of a fractured society.

Alys and Ned are very much baby orcs, blameless but the children of people who betrayed House Stark and caused harm.

Execute all of them? Ship them off to Essos? Try to bring them into the fold as well, as he did with the Wildlings? Or will he be plagued by Dothraki blood riders raiding and pillaging Westeros through out his reign?\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s, to my mid, the real essence of GRRM\u2019s question.

                "content": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p>You can call me fortunatelylori or lori or whatever&nbsp; you like. Just make it something nice. :)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve actually been thinking about the&nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What about the orc babies?&rdquo; question a lot. I just don&rsquo;t think b0atie is the answer to that question. Most importantly, this would be Jon&rsquo;s kid so he would have a vested interest in keeping him safe. He wouldn&rsquo;t be one of Aragon&rsquo;s orcs.&nbsp;</p><p>I also think it&rsquo;s a mistake to take everything GRRM says literally. GRRM&rsquo;s question hankers back to the fall-out of war and how rulers choose to handle the different factions that fought in that war. Meaning, how much punishment is to be dealt to the people that fought on the wrong side and how far should a ruler go in order to ensure peace and the healing of a fractured society.
