            "description": "In addition to the pain and the exhaustion, he recalled how waiting on the cross between takes became tedious. To fight the boredom, he listened to music on headphones. One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",

I was thinking about how John Wick and Jason Bourne could be brought together. My thoughts became long, and I started writing it down. This isn\u2019t a story, just a sketch of how I think such a movie could be made. It\u2019s not really edited either, this is all off-the-cuff.</p><p>[I only know what\u2019s in the movies. I don\u2019t know other canon from either \u2018verse.]</p><p>So, if I were making a movie\u2026</p><p>The universes of John Wick and Jason Bourne have very different styles, creating a problem.</p><p>Problem:<br/>- Bourne lives in a Universe where government is large, powerful, knowledgeable and nearly competent.<br/>- Wick lives in a Universe where a vast and elaborate criminal underworld exists, where we\u2019ve never seen those major criminal figures worry about law enforcement or government.</p><p>The discrepancy must be resolved.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>Jason Bourne has never dealt with crime. Everything has been political and confined to the intelligence community.</p><p>Wick has never dealt with politics or the intelligence community.</p><p>So.</p><p>We must assume that the intelligence community is perfectly happy to leave common crime in the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>- Law enforcement has an unwritten and fatalistic attitude that there will always be some level of crime no matter what you do because it\u2019s innate to human nature. And if you\u2019re going to have crime, it might as well be organized. Let the strongest and most dangerous criminals accumulate power and influence, because they will go a long way to controlling the stupid, the excessive and the disruptive crooks. Better to have one major weapons trafficker controlling the traffic than have a thousand slightly smaller and more disruptive dealers completely out of control. (You can strongly hint that there\u2019s an uneasy, unwritten and largely unspoken agreement between crime and law enforcement, and that it\u2019s often a two-way street.) And if the big crime gets too big, it\u2019s easier to knock it back down to \u201cacceptable\u201d levels because you\u2019ve got bigger targets, which are easier to hit and which make a large and impressive splash across the front page when you throw RICO charges at them.</p><p>Plus it would also illustrate that Wickian Law Enforcement at its highest levels is just as dirty, amoral and underhanded as the Bournite Intelligence community.</p><p>- So, with a little work and willing suspension of disbelief (which wouldn\u2019t be hard, because who wouldn\u2019t want to see Wick and Bourne on the same screen provided it\u2019s done with at least half an ass), it\u2019s possible to bring the two Universes together.</p><p>- We start with Bourne. Someone else, like an hard ass, experienced reporter, is snooping into the government\u2019s history of creating conditioned assassins. Maybe because a public face, like a former intelligence director, has left the shade to become a politician. And many strongly suspect that he\u2019s dirty as fuck, but our snoopy reporter is just figuring out how deep the rabbit hole goes. Our politician was, of course, instrumental in developing programs like Treadstone, Blackbriar, et al.</p><p>- The Snoop finds out, one way or another, that one of the earliest failures of these programs was an \u201casset\u201d who experienced a psychological break, went \u201coff the res\u201d, starting killing people and still turns up now and then to kill more people. To our Snoop, it appears that the government has created an uncontrollable monster who is still on the loose and possibly lurking right outside the White House, dear reader, are you scared now?</p><p>- The story, scanty, incorrect and harshly spun, gets printed as above. A few names are named, but mostly dead people (and maybe someone who has already been publicly discredited.) Our politician is not named because our Snoop doesn\u2019t yet have absolute proof linking Mr. Politician to the Treadstone/Blackbriar/etc. machine.</p><p>- The evidence still exists. Witnesses still live, in numbers too great to be cleanly eliminated.</p><p>- Mr. Politician is sweating bullets.</p><p>- The Snoop isn\u2019t done. He wants to find Bourne so he can say, \u201cHere\u2019s your monster, where\u2019s my Pulitzer?\u201d As investigation continues, the story becomes clearer to the Snoop, and the monster starts to look like little less monstrous and little more victimized. Which is an even better story.</p><p>- Now Mr. Politician is not only worried that he will be named, he\u2019s worried that if Snoop makes contact with Bourne, or simply as a consequence of Snoop stirring the shit, Bourne will find out who our Politician is and how complicit he was in the program that destroyed David Webb. Mr. Pol knows this is likely to be a death sentence.</p><p>- It has become obvious to everyone who isn\u2019t deeply deluded that Jason Bourne is practically indestructible and that sending more valuable and increasingly scarce \u2018assets\u2019 against him is just going to result in the loss of those assets. Agents available may be trained and conditioned to within an inch of their lives, but Bourne\u2019s psychological break caused him to exceed his limits, training and conditioning in a way Black Ops programs haven\u2019t been able to replicate. Those with a pragmatic attitude believe that they have no agent who can measure up to Bourne. Politician believes this as well.</p><p>- But Mr. Politician knows some things that the intelligence community has never concerned itself with. In his many years of government service, Mr. Pol was also involved with Law Enforcement at various times. Maybe he did a stint with the effa-bee-eye. Whatever. He knows about the Criminal Underworld, he knows that to maintain the ugly equilibrium, the Underworld may be influenced to comply with certain requests. And he knows a name. John Wick.</p><p>- Mr. Politician is also savvy about recent developments in the Underworld. He\u2019s got a friend who\u2019s still in the business of monitoring organized crime and keeping tabs on what\u2019s going on down there. Mr. Pol has listened to recent stories with fascination because of certain similarities to a well known government failure who has haunted his dreams for decades. It has become a fact in Mr. Pol\u2019s mind that the CIA will never be able to take down Bourne, but maybe there\u2019s another way.</p><p>- Mr. Politician approaches a major Crime Lord and tells him point blank to activate John Wick by any means necessary and set him on the trail of one Jason Bourne. If Wick can\u2019t be activated, Crime Lord will receive his own personal set of extensive criminal and RICO charges, delivered to his doorstep by the entire FBI</p><p>- Crime Lord knows if he gets charged, he probably won\u2019t survive because other crime lords are going to want to make sure he doesn\u2019t talk - about them. Also, his family will be endangered no matter which way the sword swings; either the FBI will be targeting them or his fellow criminals will be.</p><p>- Crime Lord knows John Wick. They\u2019re old friends. Crime Lord feels a bit conflicted about it, but his first loyalties are to his family and his own hide. So he swallows his fondness for John Wick and commits falsehood, deception, a calling in of favors, maybe a little blackmail and the old Rock-And-A-Hard-Fuck-You-Up-Place on Wick. An elaborate, manipulative lie, that sets a misinformed John Wick on the trail of a man potentially as dangerous as himself.</p><p>- Now, we\u2019ve got Jason Bourne being hunted by the Snoop, which has him on alert. We have John Wick hunting Bourne because he believes, once again, that he has no choice.</p><p>- We also have a Jason Bourne who is somewhat confounded. We need the scene where Bourne finds out, before contact ever takes place, that someone has taken out a contract on him with an Underworld assassin. Bourne doesn\u2019t know much more about the Criminal Underworld than Joe Schmoe from Kokomo, just what he\u2019s seen in the news and largely ignored, because it never had anything to do with him. Even in all that training years and years ago, there was this gap, because organized crime wasn\u2019t the CIA\u2019s beat. Maybe at first, Bourne even assumes that this Wick character isn\u2019t a threat because he\u2019s just a murderer, a thug, and not a highly trained government operative like himself.</p><p>- So in a riveting scene where Bourne and Wick first come into contact, we see Bourne - under the influence of his ignorant assumption - nearly getting killed by Wick and making an extremely narrow escape by use of desperate measures. We also have Mr. Wick limping away, suitably impressed with the skills of his opponent.</p><p>- Now we have that stretch of the story where Wick is on the hunt, Bourne is on the run and Bourne is trying to uncover any information he can find about this assassin. Wick doesn\u2019t research much, though, because that\u2019s not how he works. Bourne is a machine; the gears must grind. Wick is a force of nature, like a tornado; most of the info he gets he just picks up along the way, either paying for it or having it given to him by friends.</p><p>- Bourne discovers that Wick had a military past, Special Forces, maybe he was fucked over by the military/government in his own way. Or Bourne sees it that way. Bourne finds out about Helen and her death, and maybe not the whole story, but quite a bit about how John cut through a small army of Russian mob mooks for vengeance. He identifies with Wick\u2019s grief and anger. He sees something of himself in John Wick. He sympathizes with the devil.</p><p>- John hasn\u2019t done the heavy research. He understands that Bourne is dangerous, perhaps more dangerous than anyone he\u2019s ever met. He consolidates his resources and finds someone else to do his research. He is awaiting a report on Jason Bourne when\u2026</p><p>- Bourne stops running, goes to confront Wick and ends up trying to explain, while fighting of course, what he knows about the Dirty Politician and the Crime Lord who has called John out of his troubled retirement yet again, and how Wick has been used and betrayed (this time) until he says something that causes Wick to call truce long enough to hear it all.</p><p>- Bourne can see the beginning of a way to solve the whole mess. After some persuasion, Wick is on board and has some ideas of his own.</p><p>- Now we\u2019ve got our boys on the same side and it\u2019s only left to decide whether the war will be conventional or nuclear.</p><p>- There are two victories we need to see. We must see the destruction of Mr. Politician and Mr. Crime Lord.</p><p>- You might-could send Bourne, who doesn\u2019t really give a shit about the covenants and conventions of the criminal world, to the Continental - probably breaking in, instead of checking in. Luring the Crime Lord out into the open, perhaps on the intimation that Mr. Politician is about to take up backstabbing. Draw the Crime Lord out to confront the Politician. Bourne\u2019s plan, reluctantly agreed to by Wick, is to draw the Politician and the Crime Lord together, get evidence and even a full recording of the meeting and expose them both to the world.</p><p>Or course, this backfires. Bourne finds himself in a position where he has to kill either Crime Lord or Mr. Politician in self-defense. Probably the Crime Lord.</p><p>- It would also be immensely satisfying to see Wick take out the dirty politician with a head shot. Bourne would, of course, be stoically pissed about it all, but it also illustrates the difference. Bourne is willing to let even unrepentant bastards live because he\u2019s tired of having blood on his hands. Wick doesn\u2019t let anybody live who\u2019s fucked him over. Bourne is still conflicted about who and what he is. Wick has come to terms with himself. Bourne believes in atonement. Wick believes in damnation. Bourne still cares. Wick doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Bourne still dreams of inner peace. Wick would settle for a little peace and quiet, would you motherfuckers just leave me the fuck alone already. Get off my lawn. And stop teasing my dog, you bastards.</p><p>(Bourne, of course, is a brutally disillusioned idealist. He had no idea he was signing away his soul. Wick likely sold his soul with his eyes wide open, though he probably only understood the ultimate cost later on - a naive pragmatist.)</p><p>- You must also show Wick taking an active role in planning, because if Bourne does all of it and says here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, then 1) he\u2019s just using Wick as a tool or weapon, instead of treating him like a person and an equal and 2) Wick once again is being controlled by someone else instead of doing what he does best, which is take matters into his own hands (shooting Santino may have looked like a misstep, but who in the audience didn\u2019t love it?)</p><p>- I\u2019ve forgotten our Snoop reporter.</p><p>We could let Bourne track him down, in which case he will almost certainly die, because going by canon everybody who sympathizes with Jason Bourne must die.</p><p>We could let Wick find him, in which case he probably has a much better chance of surviving to publish his Pulitzer Prize winning story provided he\u2019s not armed when he meets Mr. Wick. Hell, Wick could give him a coin, which could buy him entrance and protection at the Continental (even the government doesn\u2019t want to mess with that bunch - like stirring a hornet\u2019s nest with a stick; you might survive, but it will be excruciatingly painful and you\u2019ll look like an idiot the whole time with all the screaming and flailing and jumping around in a panic.)</p><p>John Wick\u2019s name will not appear in the story. Only a vaguely defined \u201cother sources\u201d.</p><p>- And after all is said and done, Bourne and Wick part company, with mutual respect and recognition. Though they really don\u2019t like each other very much.</p><p>So that\u2019s my John Wick/Jason Bourne movie which will never be made. But I had fun.</p><p>P.S.

I was thinking about how John Wick and Jason Bourne could be brought together. My thoughts became long, and I started writing it down. This isn\u2019t a story, just a sketch of how I think such a movie could be made. It\u2019s not really edited either, this is all off-the-cuff.</p><p>[I only know what\u2019s in the movies. I don\u2019t know other canon from either \u2018verse.]</p><p>So, if I were making a movie\u2026</p><p>The universes of John Wick and Jason Bourne have very different styles, creating a problem.</p><p>Problem:<br>- Bourne lives in a Universe where government is large, powerful, knowledgeable and nearly competent.<br>- Wick lives in a Universe where a vast and elaborate criminal underworld exists, where we\u2019ve never seen those major criminal figures worry about law enforcement or government.</p><p>The discrepancy must be resolved.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>Jason Bourne has never dealt with crime. Everything has been political and confined to the intelligence community.</p><p>Wick has never dealt with politics or the intelligence community.</p><p>So.</p><p>We must assume that the intelligence community is perfectly happy to leave common crime in the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>- Law enforcement has an unwritten and fatalistic attitude that there will always be some level of crime no matter what you do because it\u2019s innate to human nature. And if you\u2019re going to have crime, it might as well be organized. Let the strongest and most dangerous criminals accumulate power and influence, because they will go a long way to controlling the stupid, the excessive and the disruptive crooks. Better to have one major weapons trafficker controlling the traffic than have a thousand slightly smaller and more disruptive dealers completely out of control. (You can strongly hint that there\u2019s an uneasy, unwritten and largely unspoken agreement between crime and law enforcement, and that it\u2019s often a two-way street.)

I was thinking about how John Wick and Jason Bourne could be brought together. My thoughts became long, and I started writing it down. This isn\u2019t a story, just a sketch of how I think such a movie could be made. It\u2019s not really edited either, this is all off-the-cuff.</p><p>[I only know what\u2019s in the movies. I don\u2019t know other canon from either \u2018verse.]</p><p>So, if I were making a movie\u2026</p><p>The universes of John Wick and Jason Bourne have very different styles, creating a problem.</p><p>Problem:<br>- Bourne lives in a Universe where government is large, powerful, knowledgeable and nearly competent.<br>- Wick lives in a Universe where a vast and elaborate criminal underworld exists, where we\u2019ve never seen those major criminal figures worry about law enforcement or government.</p><p>The discrepancy must be resolved.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>Jason Bourne has never dealt with crime. Everything has been political and confined to the intelligence community.</p><p>Wick has never dealt with politics or the intelligence community.</p><p>So.</p><p>We must assume that the intelligence community is perfectly happy to leave common crime in the hands of law enforcement.</p><p>- Law enforcement has an unwritten and fatalistic attitude that there will always be some level of crime no matter what you do because it\u2019s innate to human nature. And if you\u2019re going to have crime, it might as well be organized. Let the strongest and most dangerous criminals accumulate power and influence, because they will go a long way to controlling the stupid, the excessive and the disruptive crooks. Better to have one major weapons trafficker controlling the traffic than have a thousand slightly smaller and more disruptive dealers completely out of control. (You can strongly hint that there\u2019s an uneasy, unwritten and largely unspoken agreement between crime and law enforcement, and that it\u2019s often a two-way street.) And if the big crime gets too big, it\u2019s easier to knock it back down to \u201cacceptable\u201d levels because you\u2019ve got bigger targets, which are easier to hit and which make a large and impressive splash across the front page when you throw RICO charges at them.</p><p>Plus it would also illustrate that Wickian Law Enforcement at its highest levels is just as dirty, amoral and underhanded as the Bournite Intelligence community.</p><p>- So, with a little work and willing suspension of disbelief (which wouldn\u2019t be hard, because who wouldn\u2019t want to see Wick and Bourne on the same screen provided it\u2019s done with at least half an ass), it\u2019s possible to bring the two Universes together.</p><p>- We start with Bourne. Someone else, like an hard ass, experienced reporter, is snooping into the government\u2019s history of creating conditioned assassins. Maybe because a public face, like a former intelligence director, has left the shade to become a politician. And many strongly suspect that he\u2019s dirty as fuck, but our snoopy reporter is just figuring out how deep the rabbit hole goes. Our politician was, of course, instrumental in developing programs like Treadstone, Blackbriar, et al.</p><p>- The Snoop finds out, one way or another, that one of the earliest failures of these programs was an \u201casset\u201d who experienced a psychological break, went \u201coff the res\u201d, starting killing people and still turns up now and then to kill more people. To our Snoop, it appears that the government has created an uncontrollable monster who is still on the loose and possibly lurking right outside the White House, dear reader, are you scared now?</p><p>- The story, scanty, incorrect and harshly spun, gets printed as above. A few names are named, but mostly dead people (and maybe someone who has already been publicly discredited.) Our politician is not named because our Snoop doesn\u2019t yet have absolute proof linking Mr. Politician to the Treadstone/Blackbriar/etc. machine.</p><p>- The evidence still exists. Witnesses still live, in numbers too great to be cleanly eliminated.</p><p>- Mr. Politician is sweating bullets.</p><p>- The Snoop isn\u2019t done. He wants to find Bourne so he can say, \u201cHere\u2019s your monster, where\u2019s my Pulitzer?\u201d As investigation continues, the story becomes clearer to the Snoop, and the monster starts to look like little less monstrous and little more victimized. Which is an even better story.</p><p>- Now Mr. Politician is not only worried that he will be named, he\u2019s worried that if Snoop makes contact with Bourne, or simply as a consequence of Snoop stirring the shit, Bourne will find out who our Politician is and how complicit he was in the program that destroyed David Webb. Mr. Pol knows this is likely to be a death sentence.</p><p>- It has become obvious to everyone who isn\u2019t deeply deluded that Jason Bourne is practically indestructible and that sending more valuable and increasingly scarce \u2018assets\u2019 against him is just going to result in the loss of those assets. Agents available may be trained and conditioned to within an inch of their lives, but Bourne\u2019s psychological break caused him to exceed his limits, training and conditioning in a way Black Ops programs haven\u2019t been able to replicate. Those with a pragmatic attitude believe that they have no agent who can measure up to Bourne. Politician believes this as well.</p><p>- But Mr. Politician knows some things that the intelligence community has never concerned itself with. In his many years of government service, Mr. Pol was also involved with Law Enforcement at various times. Maybe he did a stint with the effa-bee-eye. Whatever. He knows about the Criminal Underworld, he knows that to maintain the ugly equilibrium, the Underworld may be influenced to comply with certain requests. And he knows a name. John Wick.</p><p>- Mr. Politician is also savvy about recent developments in the Underworld. He\u2019s got a friend who\u2019s still in the business of monitoring organized crime and keeping tabs on what\u2019s going on down there. Mr. Pol has listened to recent stories with fascination because of certain similarities to a well known government failure who has haunted his dreams for decades. It has become a fact in Mr. Pol\u2019s mind that the CIA will never be able to take down Bourne, but maybe there\u2019s another way.</p><p>- Mr. Politician approaches a major Crime Lord and tells him point blank to activate John Wick by any means necessary and set him on the trail of one Jason Bourne. If Wick can\u2019t be activated, Crime Lord will receive his own personal set of extensive criminal and RICO charges, delivered to his doorstep by the entire FBI</p><p>- Crime Lord knows if he gets charged, he probably won\u2019t survive because other crime lords are going to want to make sure he doesn\u2019t talk - about them. Also, his family will be endangered no matter which way the sword swings; either the FBI will be targeting them or his fellow criminals will be.</p><p>- Crime Lord knows John Wick. They\u2019re old friends. Crime Lord feels a bit conflicted about it, but his first loyalties are to his family and his own hide. So he swallows his fondness for John Wick and commits falsehood, deception, a calling in of favors, maybe a little blackmail and the old Rock-And-A-Hard-Fuck-You-Up-Place on Wick. An elaborate, manipulative lie, that sets a misinformed John Wick on the trail of a man potentially as dangerous as himself.</p><p>- Now, we\u2019ve got Jason Bourne being hunted by the Snoop, which has him on alert. We have John Wick hunting Bourne because he believes, once again, that he has no choice.</p><p>- We also have a Jason Bourne who is somewhat confounded. We need the scene where Bourne finds out, before contact ever takes place, that someone has taken out a contract on him with an Underworld assassin. Bourne doesn\u2019t know much more about the Criminal Underworld than Joe Schmoe from Kokomo, just what he\u2019s seen in the news and largely ignored, because it never had anything to do with him. Even in all that training years and years ago, there was this gap, because organized crime wasn\u2019t the CIA\u2019s beat. Maybe at first, Bourne even assumes that this Wick character isn\u2019t a threat because he\u2019s just a murderer, a thug, and not a highly trained government operative like himself.</p><p>- So in a riveting scene where Bourne and Wick first come into contact, we see Bourne - under the influence of his ignorant assumption - nearly getting killed by Wick and making an extremely narrow escape by use of desperate measures. We also have Mr. Wick limping away, suitably impressed with the skills of his opponent.</p><p>- Now we have that stretch of the story where Wick is on the hunt, Bourne is on the run and Bourne is trying to uncover any information he can find about this assassin. Wick doesn\u2019t research much, though, because that\u2019s not how he works. Bourne is a machine; the gears must grind. Wick is a force of nature, like a tornado; most of the info he gets he just picks up along the way, either paying for it or having it given to him by friends.</p><p>- Bourne discovers that Wick had a military past, Special Forces, maybe he was fucked over by the military/government in his own way. Or Bourne sees it that way. Bourne finds out about Helen and her death, and maybe not the whole story, but quite a bit about how John cut through a small army of Russian mob mooks for vengeance. He identifies with Wick\u2019s grief and anger. He sees something of himself in John Wick. He sympathizes with the devil.</p><p>- John hasn\u2019t done the heavy research. He understands that Bourne is dangerous, perhaps more dangerous than anyone he\u2019s ever met. He consolidates his resources and finds someone else to do his research. He is awaiting a report on Jason Bourne when\u2026</p><p>- Bourne stops running, goes to confront Wick and ends up trying to explain, while fighting of course, what he knows about the Dirty Politician and the Crime Lord who has called John out of his troubled retirement yet again, and how Wick has been used and betrayed (this time) until he says something that causes Wick to call truce long enough to hear it all.</p><p>- Bourne can see the beginning of a way to solve the whole mess. After some persuasion, Wick is on board and has some ideas of his own.</p><p>- Now we\u2019ve got our boys on the same side and it\u2019s only left to decide whether the war will be conventional or nuclear.</p><p>- There are two victories we need to see. We must see the destruction of Mr. Politician and Mr. Crime Lord.</p><p>- You might-could send Bourne, who doesn\u2019t really give a shit about the covenants and conventions of the criminal world, to the Continental - probably breaking in, instead of checking in. Luring the Crime Lord out into the open, perhaps on the intimation that Mr. Politician is about to take up backstabbing. Draw the Crime Lord out to confront the Politician. Bourne\u2019s plan, reluctantly agreed to by Wick, is to draw the Politician and the Crime Lord together, get evidence and even a full recording of the meeting and expose them both to the world.</p><p>Or course, this backfires. Bourne finds himself in a position where he has to kill either Crime Lord or Mr. Politician in self-defense. Probably the Crime Lord.</p><p>- It would also be immensely satisfying to see Wick take out the dirty politician with a head shot. Bourne would, of course, be stoically pissed about it all, but it also illustrates the difference. Bourne is willing to let even unrepentant bastards live because he\u2019s tired of having blood on his hands. Wick doesn\u2019t let anybody live who\u2019s fucked him over. Bourne is still conflicted about who and what he is. Wick has come to terms with himself. Bourne believes in atonement. Wick believes in damnation. Bourne still cares. Wick doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Bourne still dreams of inner peace. Wick would settle for a little peace and quiet, would you motherfuckers just leave me the fuck alone already. Get off my lawn. And stop teasing my dog, you bastards.</p><p>(Bourne, of course, is a brutally disillusioned idealist. He had no idea he was signing away his soul. Wick likely sold his soul with his eyes wide open, though he probably only understood the ultimate cost later on - a naive pragmatist.)</p><p>- You must also show Wick taking an active role in planning, because if Bourne does all of it and says here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, then 1) he\u2019s just using Wick as a tool or weapon, instead of treating him like a person and an equal and 2) Wick once again is being controlled by someone else instead of doing what he does best, which is take matters into his own hands (shooting Santino may have looked like a misstep, but who in the audience didn\u2019t love it?)</p><p>- I\u2019ve forgotten our Snoop reporter.</p><p>We could let Bourne track him down, in which case he will almost certainly die, because going by canon everybody who sympathizes with Jason Bourne must die.</p><p>We could let Wick find him, in which case he probably has a much better chance of surviving to publish his Pulitzer Prize winning story provided he\u2019s not armed when he meets Mr. Wick. Hell, Wick could give him a coin, which could buy him entrance and protection at the Continental (even the government doesn\u2019t want to mess with that bunch - like stirring a hornet\u2019s nest with a stick; you might survive, but it will be excruciatingly painful and you\u2019ll look like an idiot the whole time with all the screaming and flailing and jumping around in a panic.)</p><p>John Wick\u2019s name will not appear in the story. Only a vaguely defined \u201cother sources\u201d.</p><p>- And after all is said and done, Bourne and Wick part company, with mutual respect and recognition. Though they really don\u2019t like each other very much.</p><p>So that\u2019s my John Wick/Jason Bourne movie which will never be made. But I had fun.</p><p>P.S. Please excuse crappy photoshop, I just wanted something there.<br></p>",
