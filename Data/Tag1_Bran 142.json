        "body": "<p>In ASOIAF\nwe have two very obvious sources of magic: The Ice of the WW north of the Wall\nand the fire that is present in the dragons and Rh\u2019llors magic. Both magics\nseem to be very strong \u2013 both the WW and the servants of Rh\u2019llor can resurrect\nthe dead \u2013 producing ice wights or fire wights, respectively.</p><p>It has\npuzzled me for some time, that as regards to the traditional four elements\n\u201cearth, fire, air and water\u201d, the two opposites \u201cice and fire\u201d do not exactly\nmatch. Fire obviously melts ice, but then ice becomes water that will\nextinguish the fire in turn. So, why ice and not water as an opposite to fire?</p><p>I put this under the cut because it became huge&hellip;</p><!-- more --><p>The show\ngave us a big hint as to the origins of the White Walkers. We saw the Children\nof the Forest make the first White Walker aka the Night King, and it seems\npretty clear, that the WW \u2013 at least in the show \u2013 are an experiment of the CotF\nthat has gone awry. The CotF woke ice magic and it developed an agenda of its\nown. It can be argued that the books might go in the same direction. There are\nhints that the Others are a problem the CotF created and that they finally\nallied with the First men to get rid of the threat \u2013 and did not succeed\nentirely. </p><p>So, ice\nmagic might be a variant of earth and water (or nature) magic, that has spiralled\nout of control. This instigated me to look at what we have in regard to earth\nmagic and water magic.</p><p>I do think\nthat from the description of the CotF in AWOIAF it is pretty clear, that the\nCotF do have an element of nature and earth magic.</p><blockquote><p>The gods\nthe children worshipped were the nameless ones that would one day become the\ngods of the First Men\u2014the innumerable gods of <b>the streams and forests and stones</b>. (AWOIAF, The Dawn Age)</p></blockquote><p>And also in\nBran\u2019s PoV we have some hints to earth magic, most blatantly in the oath of\nJojen and Meera Reed, who as \u2018frog-eaters\u2019 from the Neck have very close\nconnection to nature. In addition, their small stature probably makes them\nstand-ins for the CotF if not even descendants. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I swear it by <b>earth</b> and <b>water</b>,&rdquo; said the boy in green.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear it by bronze and iron,&rdquo;\nhis sister said. </p><p>&ldquo;We swear it by <b>ice</b> and <b>fire</b>,&rdquo; they finished together.</p><p> (ACOK, Bran III)</p></blockquote><p>This oath\nis surely a fogged memory about the first oath between CotF and the First men.\nEarth and Water is the magic of the CotF, bronze and iron are weapons (iron in\nlegends being specifically a weapon of men, not to be used by the faerie, elves\nor however you want to call them) and ice and fire is the common enemy. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nsaid Meera, &ldquo;but he could <b>breathe mud</b> and <b>run on leaves</b>, and change <b>earth</b>\nto <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> to <b>earth</b> with no\nmore than a whispered word. He could talk to trees and weave words and make\ncastles appear and disappear.&rdquo; (ASOS, Bran II)</p></blockquote><p>Here Meera\ntalks about her father, or rather about the legendary version of him. I would\nalert you to the fact, that earth and water are interchangeable and that there\nis an obvious stage of transmission as mud. </p><p>Also Bran\u2019s\nexperience while warging summer have a very earthy and magical vibe to them:</p><blockquote><p>The\nevening&rsquo;s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and\nstrong again. Grass and thorns, blackberries broken on the ground, mud, worms, rotting leaves, a rat\ncreeping through the bush. He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother&rsquo;s\ncoat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he&rsquo;d killed. Other\nsquirrels moved through the branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, their\nlittle claws scratching at the bark. The noise had sounded something like that.\n(ACOK, Bran VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is also the very real magical moment Jon experiences north of the\nwall, when he is at a place where the CotF might have influence. <br/></p><blockquote><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every\nblade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond.\nFlowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. <b>Even the mud puddles had\na bright brown sheen</b>. Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of\nhis brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice. </p><p>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all. He found himself thinking of\nhis sisters, perhaps because he&rsquo;d dreamed of them last night. Sansa would call\nthis an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but\nArya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all. (ACOK, Jon\nIII)</p></blockquote><p>Now, this\nmade me wonder again, how earth and water come into play for the arcs of our\ncharacters in ASOIAF and that in turn led me to look at the Tullys and the word\n\u201c<b>mud</b>\u201d \u2013 the connection of earth and\nwater and I think I found some connections that might be worth pondering. </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> told\nme to be cautious about that, because, you know, mud happens if it rains, and\nit is no wonder that we see mud a lot in some of the PoVs, but still there are\nsome interesting observations to be made. So, my following deliberations are\nnot based on every mention of the word \u2018mud\u2019, because I would argue that sometimes\n\u2018mud\u2019 is just \u2018mud\u2019 and not a hint to the earth and water magic.</p><p>\n\n1) Tully mud\n\n</p><p>First of\nall, the observation that stuck out most to me is that mud is connected to the\nTullys and the Riverlands, explicitly and repeatedly. And it is a sort of\nreddish mud: red mud and blue water are the Tully colours.</p><blockquote><p>Catelyn raised her eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a\npath across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god.\n&ldquo;The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a <b>red</b> flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure\nthinks it&rsquo;s an omen of victory for Riverrun\u2014he sees a fish with a long tail, in\nthe Tully colors, red against blue.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;I wish I had their\nfaith. Crimson is a Lannister color.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That thing&rsquo;s not crimson,&rdquo; Ser Brynden said. &ldquo;Nor Tully\nred, the <b>mud</b> <b>red</b> of the\nriver. That&rsquo;s <b>blood</b> up there, child,\nsmeared across the sky.&rdquo;(ACOK, Catelyn I)</p></blockquote><p>Repeatedly the\nTullys enter the stage all muddied: first of all Edmure Tully (ACOK, Catelyn VI,\nASOS, Catelyn I, and AFFC, Jaime VI), but also the Blackfish (ACOK, Catelyn I).\nCatelyn herself seems positively fond of mud. She fondly remembers baking \u2018mud\npies\u2019 with Lysa and Petyr when they were children, and during her travels in\nAGOT she also gets muddy quite often \u2013 and seems to like it: </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is\nonly water, Ser Rodrik,&rdquo; Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a\nloose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild\nshe must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and\nwarm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother&rsquo;s kisses. It\ntook her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered\nthe godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her\nbrother&rsquo;s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She\nremembered making <b>mud</b> <b>pies</b>\nwith Lysa, the weight of them, the <b>mud</b> slick and brown between her\nfingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he&rsquo;d eaten so much\n<b>mud</b> he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. (AGOT, Catelyn\nV)</p></blockquote><p>The mud of\nthe river is also the graveyard of the Tullys, as we learn at the \u2018burial\u2019 of\nHoster Tully. </p><blockquote><p>And then it\nwas gone &hellip; drifting downriver still, perhaps, or broken up and sinking. The\nweight of his armor would carry Lord Hoster down to rest in the soft <b>mud</b>\nof the riverbed, in the watery halls where the Tullys held eternal court, with\nschools of fish their last attendants. (ASOS, Catelyn IV)</p></blockquote><p>Catelyn\nherself is resurrected from the mud as Lady Stoneheart when Nymeria drags her\nout of the river (ASOS, Arya XII).</p><p>There is\neven a connection of mud and the Riverlands in F&amp;B: Harren the Black\ncomplains about\u2026 <br/></p><blockquote><p>\u201cthese traitors of the Trident, these lords of yellow mud.\u201d (F&amp;B,\nAegon\u2019s conquest).</p></blockquote><p>This should\nbe enough to establish that <b>mud</b> has\na strong <b>Tully connection </b>and therefore it is interesting to look at how mud is\ndepicted in the arcs of Catelyn\u2019s children. <br/></p><p>\n2) Sansa and Bran\n\n\n\n<br/></p><p>In Sansa\u2019s PoV mud occurs exactly only\nonce as it touches her, and it is no actual mud but just the feeling of not\nbeing able to walk: </p><blockquote><p>She forced\nherself to take King Joffrey&rsquo;s hand. The climb was something out of a\nnightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of <b>ankle-deep</b> <b>mud</b>, and there were\nmore steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror\nwaiting on the ramparts. (AGOT, Sansa VI)</p></blockquote><p>We have to\ncount out the Mud Gate in King\u2019s Landing. Now, of course Sansa stays mostly\nindoors, and in the Vale she is confronted with snow, not mud, but it is at\nleast worth noting, I think, that mud does not occur often in her POV, not in\nconnection to her anyway.</p><p>Bran\u2019s PoV\ndoesn\u2019t exactly overflow with mud connections either. One very interesting occurrence\nis when he plays with the Frey wards in ACOK. The Freys are the traitors and I would\nalert you to the fact that mud is connected to blood in this case.</p><blockquote><p>&hellip; until\nLittle Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across his belly.\nBefore Bran could blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was <b>blood</b> in the water, the Walders were\nshrieking <b>red</b> murder, Rickon sat in\nthe <b>mud</b> laughing, and Hodor came lumbering in shouting &ldquo;Hodor! Hodor!\nHodor!&rdquo; (ACOK, Bran I)</p></blockquote><p>So, neither Bran nor Sansa have a very strong Tully/water magic connection. That is completely different for<br/></p><p>3) Arya\n\n</p><p>There is no lack of mud, not at all. Interestingly it is in Sansa\u2019s Pov\nthat we see her connection to mud for the first time:</p><blockquote><p>She found\nArya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she\nbrushed dried <b>mud</b> from her fur. (AGOT, Sansa I) </p></blockquote><p>The\ndirewolves give hints about the personas of their owners, and it is extremely\ninteresting that we see Nymeria covered in mud through Sansa\u2019s eyes.</p><p>And I think\nit is interesting that we see her happily playing in the mud, just like Catelyn\ndid:</p><blockquote><p>None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her\nhorsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in <b>mud</b>,\nclutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept\nhoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she\nwas supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for\nthe flowers. That just made her worse. </p><p>Then it turned out the purple\nflowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa would\nhave thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it,\nand the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman\njust because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching. (AGOT, Sansa\nI)</p></blockquote><p>Here we see\nconnection of mud and healing qualities \u2013 which might be a nod to the earth\nmagic.</p><p>I do think that\nArya\u2019s strong connection to mud has multiple purposes: It shows, that Arya, who\nlooks like Ned, also has a very strong connection to her mother, and actually\nis far more similar to her in temper than she is to Ned. Others have made this\nobservation before me: Arya looks like Ned, but is like Catelyn in temper,\nwhile Sansa looks like Catelyn, but has several traits of Ned. I do think that this\nfurther points towards the fact that Arya will meet Lady Stoneheart at one time\nin the book and will be present at the Red Wedding 2.0. (as she was in the\nshow).</p><p>Mud\nrepeatedly occurs to \u2018ground\u2019 Arya when she is on the run. It gives a hint\nabout the people she can trust. When Yoren talks with Ned, and Arya sees him,\nthe man from the Watch who will take her away from King\u2019s Landing he wears <b>mud-cacked\nboots (</b>AGOT, Eddard VII).</p><p>Later when\nArya travels with Yoren, it is Hot Pie, part of her \u2018new\u2019 family who is called\n\u2018mud pie\u2019:</p><blockquote><p>Lommy and\nTarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy <b>mud</b>\nand threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, &ldquo;<b>Mud</b> Pie! <b>Mud</b>\nPie!&rdquo; (ACOK, Arya IV).</p></blockquote><p>This is a\nclear connection to Catelyn baking mud pies with her sister.</p><p>In addition,\nArya feels positively good with water and mud:</p><blockquote><p>Despondent,\nshe climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake. The water lapped softly around\nher legs. A few lantern bugs were coming out, their little lights blinking on\nand off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in it. It\ntasted of summer and <b>mud</b> and growing things. Arya plunged her face down\ninto it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned\nback the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt\ngood. (ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>And later\nin the same chapter, crawling in the mud saves her life:</p><blockquote><p>Arya rolled\nheadfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but\nshe didn&rsquo;t care, the taste was fine, the taste was <b>mud</b> and water and\nworms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing\nbut blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses.\nShe moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to\ncrawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some\nmonstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up\nbehind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the <b>mud</b> on\nthe floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say. \u00a0(ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>Later when\nshe has to walk barefoot she does not mind:</p><blockquote><p>The <b>mud</b>\nwas nice between her toes, and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she\nwalked. (ACOK, Arya V)</p></blockquote><p>Arya is\n- at least it looks like that - directly identified with mud, although the woman might be talking about\nLem here:</p><blockquote><p>The painted\nsign above the door showed a picture of some old king on his knees. Inside was\nthe common room, where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with her\nhands on her hips, glaring. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just stand there, boy,&rdquo; she\nsnapped. &ldquo;Or are you a girl? Either one, you&rsquo;re blocking my door. Get in\nor get out. Lem, what did I tell you about my floor? <b>You&rsquo;re all</b> <b>mud</b>.&rdquo; (ASOS, Arya II) </p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis interesting that Jaqen as one of the men who seemingly helps Arya has no\nconnection to mud. The magic of the faceless men seems to draw Arya away from\nher family. It is no earth/water magic.</p><p>There is only\none time, where Arya has a distinctively bad feeling about mud. It is a very\nominous dream of Arya, which is a foreshadowing of the Red Wedding and her\ninability to help her family. It is also a back reference to Sansa and her\ninability to help her father (who was already beheaded by the time she walked\nthrough \u2018<b>ankle-deep mud\u2019</b>, forced by Joffrey to look at her father\u2019s head).</p><blockquote><p>She dreamt\nof home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. It was not a good dream, though. She was\nalone outside the castle, <b>up to her\nknees in</b> <b>mud</b>. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when\nshe tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and\nthe castle faded before her, until it looked more like smoke than granite. (ASOS,\nArya III)</p></blockquote><p>Just like\nSansa couldn\u2019t help her father, Arya can\u2019t help her mother and Robb.</p><p>This all cumulates\nin the almost reunion at the Red Wedding where mud occurs very\nfrequently in Arya\u2019s PoV. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come\nwith me.&rdquo; Sandor Clegane reached down a hand. &ldquo;We have to get away\nfrom here, and now.&rdquo; Stranger tossed his head impatiently, his nostrils\nflaring at the scent of blood. The song was done. There was only one solitary\ndrum, its slow monotonous beats echoing across the river like the pounding of\nsome monstrous heart. The black sky wept, the river grumbled, men cursed and\ndied. Arya had <b>mud</b> in her teeth and her face was wet. Rain. It&rsquo;s only\nrain. That&rsquo;s all it is. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she shouted. Her voice sounded\nthin and scared, a little girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Robb&rsquo;s just in the castle, and my\nmother. The gate&rsquo;s even open.&rdquo; There were no more Freys riding out. I came\nso far. &ldquo;We have to go get my mother.&rdquo; (ASOS, Arya IX)</p></blockquote><p>The most\nheartbreaking connection of mud to Arya\u2019s family and in particular her mother\nis still to come though: Nymeria drags Catelyn\u2019s corpse from the mud of the\nriver (remember the burial place of the Tullys) but she cannot help Catelyn,\nwho is dead.</p><blockquote><p>&hellip; and\nthen she could smell her. The scent was faint beneath the other smells, beneath\nmoss and <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>, and\nthe stench of rotting reeds and rotting men. She padded slowly through the soft\nground to the river&rsquo;s edge, lapped up a drink, the lifted her head to sniff.\nThe sky was grey and thick with cloud, the river green and full of floating\nthings. Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water pushed\nthem, others washed up on the banks. \u2026.</p><p>She\nsplashed noisily through the shallows and threw herself into the deeper water,\nher legs churning. The current was strong but she was stronger. She swam,\nfollowing her nose. The river smells were rich and wet, but those were not the\nsmells that pulled her. She paddled after the sharp <b>red</b> whisper of cold blood, the sweet cloying stench of death. She\nchased them as she had often chased a <b>red</b>\ndeer through the trees, and in the end she ran them down, and her jaw closed\naround a pale white arm. She shook it to make it move, but there was only death\nand blood in her mouth. By now she was tiring, and it was all she could do to\npull the body back to shore. As she dragged it up the <b>muddy</b> bank, one of her little brothers came prowling, his tongue\nlolling from his mouth. She had to snarl to drive him off, or else he would\nhave fed. Only then did she stop to shake the water from her fur. The white\nthing lay <b>facedown</b> in the <b>mud</b>,\nher dead flesh wrinkled and pale, cold blood trickling from her throat. Rise,\nshe thought. Rise and eat and run with us. (ASOS, Arya XII)</p></blockquote><p>I do think\nthat the colour <b>red </b>probably is put here to make a connection to the <b>red </b>of the\n<b>Tully </b>mud, and of course the blood that was spilt when Catelyn was killed.</p><p>It is\ninteresting, that as soon as Arya is in Braavos, the occurrence of mud decreases,\nbecause she disconnects with her family. It is also a strong hint, that the\nFaceless men will not be Arya\u2019s family, that she\u2019ll ultimately reject being\npart of them (like she did on the show). It is only in Arya\u2019s dreams, that mud\noccurs:</p><blockquote><p>It was the\nother dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four. In that\none she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of <b>mud</b>\nand blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her\nmother screaming, but a monster with a dog&rsquo;s head would not let her go save\nher. In that dream she was always weeping, like a frightened little girl. Cats\nnever weep, she told herself, no more than wolves do. It&rsquo;s just a stupid dream.\n(AFFC, Cat of the Canals)</p></blockquote><p>Clearly,\nthis dream is induced by Arya\u2019s trauma. </p><p>So, mud,\nthe combination of earth and water clearly occurs to \u2018ground\u2019 Arya, to give her\na connection to her mother\u2019s family, which will come into play again, once she\nreturns to Westeros. But the Tully connection, earth/water magic connection is not the only thing that stands out about mud.<br/></p><p>\n\n4) Mud and Blood\n\n</p><p>Another interesting\nfind in connection with mud is that there are multiple times that mud and blood\nare connected. In a way, this occurs naturally, the gritty realism of the\nfighting in GRRM\u2019s world is pictured by \u2018dirty\u2019 fights and therefore mud often\noccurs in fights, e.g at the tourney in King\u2019s Landing (AGOT, Eddard VII), or\nRobert\u2019s death (AGOT, Eddard XIII). Also, this fight of Brienne and Jaime might\nbe put here:</p><blockquote><p>Brienne\nlurched to her feet. She was all <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> below the waist, her clothing askew, her face red. She looks\nas if they caught us fucking instead of fighting. (ASOS, Jaime III)</p></blockquote><p>As well as\nthis fight from Asha\u2019s PoV</p><blockquote><p>When he fell, Hagen&rsquo;s daughter stumbled to her knees, snatched up his sword,\nstabbed the second man, then rose again, smeared with <b>blood</b> and <b>mud</b>, her long red hair unbound, and plunged into\nthe fight. (ADWD, The Wayward bride)</p></blockquote><p>So, these\nare just two examples where the mud adds to the \u2018dirtyness\u2019 of fighting, there\nare many more.</p><p>\n\n5) Mud and slipping/falling\n\n</p><p>A very\nspecial case of mud and fighting is when a fight ends with someone lying in the\nmud. Over the course of ASOIAF several people come to lay in the mud, wounded,\nhurt or near to death, and I think this might be way to alert us to a\nconnection of mud and death.</p><p>The very\nfirst time is in the prologue \u2013 which is also a foreshadowing of Jon\u2019s death as <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a> has shown:</p><blockquote><p>The great sentinel was right\nthere at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest\nbranches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly\nin the snow and the <b>mud</b>, and looked down on the empty clearing below. (AGOT,\nPrologue)</p></blockquote><p>When Ned\nand Jaime fight, Ned falls from his horse and lies in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Ned&rsquo;s horse\nslipped under him and came crashing down in the <b>mud</b>. There was a moment\nof blinding pain and the taste of <b>blood</b>\nin his mouth. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When he\nopened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. His horse\nmoved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to\ndrag himself through the <b>mud</b>, gritting his teeth at the agony in his\nleg. It seemed to take years. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion also\nhas a <b>muddy</b> experience in his first\nbattle:</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion\nlurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse&rsquo;s belly. The animal gave a\nhideous scream and reared. It tried to twist away from the agony, a shower of <b>blood</b> and viscera poured down over\nTyrion&rsquo;s face, and the horse fell like an avalanche. The next he knew, his\nvisor was packed with <b>mud</b> and something was crushing his foot. He\nwriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk. &ldquo;\u2026 yield \u2026&rdquo;\nhe managed to croak faintly. (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)) </p></blockquote><p>Several\npeople land on their arses in the mud, which is not necessarily connected to dying.\nArya does when she travels with the hound (ASOS, Arya XI), Podrick Payne falls\nin the mud, when Brienne catches him spying on her (AFFC, Brienne II) and Jaime\nkisses the muddy ground in his training exercise with Ser Ilyn (AFFC, Jaime V).</p><p>Yet, coming\nto fall in the mud, might be considered a bad omen, or at least a sign of sudden change. I think that <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> connected are not only there to convey a \u2018dirty\u2019 fight, but\nalso to foreshadow bad things to come. It is no happenstance that Ned falls\ninto the mud when he is confronted by Jaime Lannister in the streets of King\u2019s\nLanding.</p><p>It is\ninteresting that we see Ser Criston Cole, the commander of the King\u2019s Guard,\nand in part a Jaime stand-in, actually killing a man in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Cole\u2019s\nfavorite weapon was the Morningstar, and the blows he rained done on Ser\nLaenor\u2019s champion cracked his helm and left him senseless in the mud. Borne\nbloody from the field, Ser Joffrey died without recovering consciousness six\ndays later. (F&amp;B, Heirs of the dragon)</p></blockquote><p>The scene\nwith the most ominous foreshadowing is Jon: He is thrown into the mud, when he\nis attacked by Orell\u2019s eagle. Jon\u2019s fall and death and loss of an eye (on this compare <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHV0A6XAqV1AbH1L0Bo2Bw\">@rose-of-red-lake</a>) are\nforeshadowed several times, and Ned\u2019s fall into the mud might be another hint\nto Jon\u2019s falling, which we see here:<br/></p><p>The next he\nknew, he was <b>on his face</b> with the\ntaste of <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> in his\nmouth and Ygritte kneeling over him protectively, a bone dagger in her hand. He\ncould still hear wings, though the eagle was not in sight. Half his world was\nblack. &ldquo;My eye,&rdquo; he said in sudden panic, raising a hand to his face.\n\u2026. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your hellcrow!&rdquo; Rattleshirt pointed at Jon.\n&ldquo;Bleeding in the <b>mud</b> like a faithless dog!&rdquo; The eagle came\nflapping down to land atop the broken giant&rsquo;s skull that served him for his\nhelm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for him.&rdquo; (ASOS, Jon II)</p><p>I would\nalert you to the fact that Duncan the Tall in the Hedge Knight also has a scene\nwith mud and blood \u2013 and he is temporarily blinded by blood in his eye.</p><blockquote><p>When his\neyes opened he was on the ground again, sprawled on his back. The <b>mud</b>\nhad all been knocked from his helm, but now one eye was closed by <b>blood</b>. Above was nothing but dark grey\nsky. (The Hedge Knight)</p></blockquote><p>A variant\nof this mud and blood connection is, when Khal Drogo is dying. He does not lie\nin the mud, but the mud plasters on his wound get mixed with blood. </p><blockquote><p>When they\nwere alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy surprising in\nsuch a big man, he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried <b>blue</b> <b>mud</b> from Drogo&rsquo;s chest. The\nplaster had caked hard as the <b>mud</b> walls of the Lamb Men, and like those\nwalls it cracked easily. Ser Jorah broke the dry <b>mud</b> with his knife,\npried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul,\nsweet smell rose from the wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were\ncrusted with <b>blood</b> and pus, Drogo&rsquo;s\nbreast black and glistening with corruption. (AGOT, Daenerys VIII)</p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis extremely interesting that the mud, that was used to cover his wounds is of\nblue colour, a Tully colour maybe? </p><p>\n\n5) Mud and death\n\n</p><p>But this is\nnot all there is to \u2018mud\u2019. We have seen sliding in the \u2018mud\u2019 is a real danger\nfor anyone fighting, but mud can be deadly in other ways as well:</p><p>During\ntheir travels Brienne and Podrick chance upon dangerous mud: </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stay off the mud, child,&rdquo; counseled Septon Meribald. &ldquo;The\nmud is not fond of strangers. If you walk in the wrong place, it will open up\nand swallow you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only <b>mud</b>,&rdquo; insisted Podrick. </p><p><b>&ldquo;Until it fills your mouth and starts creeping up your nose. Then it&rsquo;s\ndeath.&rdquo; </b>He smiled to take the chill\noff his words. &ldquo;Wipe off that mud and have a slice of orange, lad.&rdquo;\n(AFFC, Brienne V)</p></blockquote><p>And later:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If\nyou would sleep beneath a roof tonight, you must climb off your horses and\ncross the <b>mud</b> with me. The path of faith, we call it. Only the faithful\nmay cross safely. The wicked are swallowed by the quicksands, or drowned when\nthe tide comes rushing in. None of you are wicked, I hope? Even so, I would be\ncareful where I set my feet. Walk only where I walk, and you shall reach the\nother side.&rdquo; (AFFC, Brienne VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is\neven mud in connection with quicksands in one of Sansa\u2019s chapters, the only\ntime apart from her walking towards the rampart as if through ankle-deep mud,\nwhere mud has an appearance in her chapters and is not connected to Arya:</p><blockquote><p>Huge\nflowers bloomed in the <b>mud</b> and floated on pools of stagnant water, but\nif you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were\nquicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and\nlizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes\nand teeth. (AGOT, Sansa I)</p></blockquote><p>Ser Davos\nhas a near death experience after the Battle of the Blackwater and the mud\nproves dangerous in this case as well.</p><blockquote><p>Panic took\nhold of him. His hands flailed against the bottom of the river and sent up a\ncloud of <b>mud</b> that blinded him. His chest was growing tighter by the\ninstant. He clawed at the water, kicking, pushing himself, turning, his lungs\nscreaming for air, kicking, kicking, lost now in the river murk, kicking,\nkicking, kicking until he could kick no longer. When he opened his mouth to\nscream, the water came rushing in, tasting of salt, and Davos Seaworth knew\nthat he was drowning. (ASOS Davos I)</p></blockquote><p>The\nincident in F&amp;B, where an archmaester dies of slipping in the mud, might be\na hint as well: </p><blockquote><p>He proved\nmore robust than his predecessor, serving the realm until 12 AC, when he\nslipped in the mud, broke his hip, and died soon thereafter\u2026. (F&amp;B, Three\nheads had the dragon) <br/></p></blockquote><p>I mean this might be coincidence, but GRRM could have\nsimply said: He took a fall?</p><p>So, what is\nit with dangerous mud? Is this a hint that Arya will become very deadly indeed? <br/></p><p>There is yet another thing, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what to make of it:<br/></p><p>6) Mud and (horse)shit\n\n</p><p>Another\ninteresting tidbit is this scene with Theon on Pyke</p><blockquote><p>Theon knelt. He had a\npurpose here, and might need Aeron&rsquo;s help to achieve it. A crown was worth a\nlittle <b>mud</b> and horseshit on his breeches, he supposed. (ACOK, Theon I)</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0- a very\nstrange wording and connection of mud and shit, but one that happens again, with\nJon of all people: </p><blockquote><p>Go on, I&rsquo;ll\nsee to your horse. If it&rsquo;s warm and dry inside, don&rsquo;t tell me, I wasn&rsquo;t asked\nin.&ldquo; He flicked a glob of wet <b>mud</b> out from under a horseshoe.\n&quot;Does this <b>mud</b> look like shit to you? Could it be that this whole\nhill is made of Craster&rsquo;s shit?&rdquo; (ACOK, Jon III).</p></blockquote><p>I would\nlike to link this to the following from Catelyn\u2019s chapters:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The distance between a lord and a grace is a small one, my\nlady,&rdquo; Catelyn said. &ldquo;Lord Renly wears a crown, as does my son. If\nyou wish, we may stand here in the <b>mud</b> and debate what honors and titles\nare rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters\nto consider.&rdquo; (ACOK, Catelyn II)</p></blockquote><p>Is this a\nhint to the debate to come when the lords will discuss Jon\u2019s claim to the\ncrown? </p><p>So mud\nmight be even involved with the making of a king? This is admittedly very\ntinfoily\u2026.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud as a part of nature\n\n</p><p>Another\nvery prominent occurrence of mud is the connection of mud with Prince Quentyn,\nthe \u2018wrong suitor\u2019, the frog prince who was not saved by princess Dany but\nfailed in his bride quest. This is what Barristan has to say about Quentyn\nbeing mud :</p><blockquote><p>She wants\nfire, and Dorne sent her <b>mud</b>. </p><p>You could\nmake a poultice out of <b>mud</b> to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in <b>mud</b>\nand grow a crop to feed your children. <b>Mud</b> would nourish you, where fire\nwould only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose\nfire every time. (ADWD, the discarded knight)</p></blockquote><p>Here mud\nhas very positive connotations, something that connects mud to healing and\nfertility.</p><p>So, mud is\nmuch more dangerous than people allow for, but is also good. It\u2019s not just\nwater and earth, there is more to it and maybe even the connection of mud and\ndeath might have a positive aspect:</p><p>Firewights\nof Rh\u2019llor and the icewights of the Others are unnatural, and if it is indeed\nArya\u2019s fate to come to a deeper understanding of mercy, justice and revenge, then\nthe final death of Lady Stoneheart \u2013 which she probably will witness \u2013 brings\nthe natural order back. </p><p>I suggest that mud might point not only to Tullys, to danger and to\ndeath, but that it might also point towards a fall and a sudden change.</p><p>Arya is the\n\u2018wild card\u2019. Where her allegiance lies, will probably be crucial, and the\ndespised mud might become dangerous up to a point where the mud can suffocate and\nkill someone.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud and danger\n\n</p><p>Finally, I\nwould alert you to some ominous foreshadowing of mud and water besides the\nconnection to Khal Drogo\u2019s death I have discussed already.</p><p>Mud\nfeatures heavily in the tragic story of Da\u20acnerys, Drogo and Mirri Maaz Duur.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I\nmeant no wrong, fierce riders.&rdquo; The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes\nshe wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with\nembroidery, but now they were <b>mud</b>-caked and bloody and ripped. She\nclutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. &ldquo;I have some\nsmall skill in the healing arts.&rdquo; (AGOT, Daenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>Mirri is a healer, and it is interesting that her and her magic (we only see her practicing blood magic, but it stands to reason that her normal way of magic would be \u2018earth-bound\u2019).<br/></p><blockquote><p>Khal Drogo\nwaved him away. &ldquo;I need no man&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; he said, in a voice proud and\nhard. He stood, unaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood ran down\nhis breast, from where Ogo&rsquo;s arakh had cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly\nto his side. &ldquo;I am no man,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;so you may lean on\nme.&rdquo; Drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as\nthey walked toward the great <b>mud</b> temple. The three bloodriders followed.\nDany commanded Ser Jorah and the warriors of her khas to guard the entrance and\nmake certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside. (AGOT,\nDaenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>I would\nalert you to the fact, that Khal Drogo burns the <b>mud</b> temple of the Lamb people. So, MMD connected to mud via her\nreligion \u2013 which is a religion that seems to be heavily influenced by earth and\nnature worship\u00a0\n\u2013\n\n is an antagonist of Da\u20acnerys.</p><p>Considering\nthat Da\u20acnerys lives in a hot climate, the rare occurrence of mud may alert us to\nimportant crossroads of her arc.</p><blockquote><p>The\nprocession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled\nclothing fall to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri\nsaid the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft <b>mud</b> <b>squishing between her toes</b> as she pushed through the tall reeds.\nThe moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her\nripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness\ncrept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion&rsquo;s blood had dried\non her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the\nsacred waters over her head, cleansing herself and the child inside her while\nthe khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the dosh khaleen\nmuttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying. (AGOT,\nDa\u20acnerys V)</p></blockquote><p>This\nhappens after Da\u20acnerys ate the horse heart and awaits the dosh khaleen\u2019s\nprophecy on the future of her child, the \u201cstallion who mounts the world\u201d. This\nis when Viserys dies and she sets herself on the path towards winning the Iron\nThrone for herself.</p><p>In her last\nchapter in ADWD (Da\u20acnerys X) there is a recollection of the time she was\npregnant with Rhaego:</p><blockquote><p>It was\nquiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed\nagainst each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now\nand again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. <b>Mud</b>\n<b>squished between her toes</b>. Insects\nbuzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps and stinging\nmidges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they landed\non her arms.</p></blockquote><p>Her last\nchapter in ADWD is also important, because she really embraces her house words\n\u2018fire and blood\u2019, the last step in her transition from a frightened child to a\nruthless conqueror. This is also the chapter, where we see her possibly having\na miscarriage:</p><blockquote><p>Her belly\nwas empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping\nhad grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels.\nShe scooped up a handful of <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>\nin trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid, but in the chill of\ndawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she splashed her\nface, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic was\nstained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it&rsquo;s only\nmy moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. <b>Could it be the water? If it was the water,\nshe was doomed</b>. She had to drink or die of thirst. (ADWD Daenerys X)</p></blockquote><p>Very\ntentatively I would suggest that \u2018mud\u2019 and/ or water does not bode well for\nDa\u20acnerys. <b>If it was the water, she was\ndoomed.</b> Who has the strongest connection to the Riverlands? Who is a\nwaterdancer? Arya, the wild card, will be threat to Da\u20acnerys I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>To sum up:</p><p>Mud as a\ncombination of earth and water has a connection to the CotF and might be usable\nto balance the dangerous opposites of fire and ice.</p><p>Mud is a\ntell-tale Tully word. The red mud of the river is a sign for Tully, and it\nshows clearly that appearances put aside, Arya is the child that is most\nclosely connected to the Tully and the Riverlands and will probably witness the\nRed Wedding 2.0. and the final death of the unnaturally resurrected Lady\nStoneheart. Arya possibly will choose mud over fire.</p><p>Mud and\nblood are used repeatedly \u2013 and many more times when I put down here as\nexamples \u2013 to picture the dirtiness of fighting. Mud also has healing\nqualities, but can be dangerous as well (as every magic). We see this rarely,\nbut nevertheless in every book and in several PoVs.</p><p>There is a\nconnection between mud and death. Slipping in the mud can mean a sudden change\nto a fight and deadly danger. I would alert you to the fact that the healing\nqualities of mud only go awry when the healing women of the Dothraki fail to\nheal Khal Drogo.</p><p>Looking at\nDa\u20acnerys\u2019 arc I would say that mud does not bode well for her. Mud as a\nreminder of a more grounded life occurs at several crossroads in her arc,\nshortly before Viserys\u2019 death, with MMD, with the rejection of Quentyn\u2019s offer\nof marriage and the decision for her house words in her last chapter in ADWD. I\nthink it points towards the fact that the very personification of \u2018mud\u2019, Arya\nStark will cause a turn in Da\u20acnerys\u2019 story. I do think it is a further hint\nthat Arya will be the death of Da\u20acnerys. </p>",

So, why ice and not water as an opposite to fire?</p><p>I put this under the cut because it became huge\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>The show\ngave us a big hint as to the origins of the White Walkers. We saw the Children\nof the Forest make the first White Walker aka the Night King, and it seems\npretty clear, that the WW \u2013 at least in the show \u2013 are an experiment of the CotF\nthat has gone awry. The CotF woke ice magic and it developed an agenda of its\nown. It can be argued that the books might go in the same direction. There are\nhints that the Others are a problem the CotF created and that they finally\nallied with the First men to get rid of the threat \u2013 and did not succeed\nentirely. </p><p>So, ice\nmagic might be a variant of earth and water (or nature) magic, that has spiralled\nout of control. This instigated me to look at what we have in regard to earth\nmagic and water magic.</p><p>I do think\nthat from the description of the CotF in AWOIAF it is pretty clear, that the\nCotF do have an element of nature and earth magic.</p><blockquote><p>The gods\nthe children worshipped were the nameless ones that would one day become the\ngods of the First Men\u2014the innumerable gods of <b>the streams and forests and stones</b>. (AWOIAF, The Dawn Age)</p></blockquote><p>And also in\nBran\u2019s PoV we have some hints to earth magic, most blatantly in the oath of\nJojen and Meera Reed, who as \u2018frog-eaters\u2019 from the Neck have very close\nconnection to nature. In addition, their small stature probably makes them\nstand-ins for the CotF if not even descendants. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI swear it by <b>earth</b> and <b>water</b>,\u201d said the boy in green.</p><p>\u201cI swear it by bronze and iron,\u201d\nhis sister said. </p><p>\u201cWe swear it by <b>ice</b> and <b>fire</b>,\u201d they finished together.</p><p> (ACOK, Bran III)</p></blockquote><p>This oath\nis surely a fogged memory about the first oath between CotF and the First men.\nEarth and Water is the magic of the CotF, bronze and iron are weapons (iron in\nlegends being specifically a weapon of men, not to be used by the faerie, elves\nor however you want to call them) and ice and fire is the common enemy. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nsaid Meera, \u201cbut he could <b>breathe mud</b> and <b>run on leaves</b>, and change <b>earth</b>\nto <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> to <b>earth</b> with no\nmore than a whispered word. He could talk to trees and weave words and make\ncastles appear and disappear.\u201d (ASOS, Bran II)</p></blockquote><p>Here Meera\ntalks about her father, or rather about the legendary version of him. I would\nalert you to the fact, that earth and water are interchangeable and that there\nis an obvious stage of transmission as mud. </p><p>Also Bran\u2019s\nexperience while warging summer have a very earthy and magical vibe to them:</p><blockquote><p>The\nevening\u2019s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and\nstrong again. Grass and thorns, blackberries broken on the ground, mud, worms, rotting leaves, a rat\ncreeping through the bush. He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother\u2019s\ncoat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he\u2019d killed. Other\nsquirrels moved through the branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, their\nlittle claws scratching at the bark. The noise had sounded something like that.\n(ACOK, Bran VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is also the very real magical moment Jon experiences north of the\nwall, when he is at a place where the CotF might have influence. <br></p><blockquote><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every\nblade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond.\nFlowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. <b>Even the mud puddles had\na bright brown sheen</b>. Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of\nhis brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice. </p><p>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all. He found himself thinking of\nhis sisters, perhaps because he\u2019d dreamed of them last night. Sansa would call\nthis an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but\nArya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all. (ACOK, Jon\nIII)</p></blockquote><p>Now, this\nmade me wonder again, how earth and water come into play for the arcs of our\ncharacters in ASOIAF and that in turn led me to look at the Tullys and the word\n\u201c<b>mud</b>\u201d \u2013 the connection of earth and\nwater and I think I found some connections that might be worth pondering. </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> told\nme to be cautious about that, because, you know, mud happens if it rains, and\nit is no wonder that we see mud a lot in some of the PoVs, but still there are\nsome interesting observations to be made. So, my following deliberations are\nnot based on every mention of the word \u2018mud\u2019, because I would argue that sometimes\n\u2018mud\u2019 is just \u2018mud\u2019 and not a hint to the earth and water magic.</p><p>\n\n1) Tully mud\n\n</p><p>First of\nall, the observation that stuck out most to me is that mud is connected to the\nTullys and the Riverlands, explicitly and repeatedly. And it is a sort of\nreddish mud: red mud and blue water are the Tully colours.</p><blockquote><p>Catelyn raised her eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a\npath across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god.\n\u201cThe Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a <b>red</b> flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure\nthinks it\u2019s an omen of victory for Riverrun\u2014he sees a fish with a long tail, in\nthe Tully colors, red against blue.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wish I had their\nfaith. Crimson is a Lannister color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing\u2019s not crimson,\u201d Ser Brynden said. \u201cNor Tully\nred, the <b>mud</b> <b>red</b> of the\nriver. That\u2019s <b>blood</b> up there, child,\nsmeared across the sky.\u201d(ACOK, Catelyn I)</p></blockquote><p>Repeatedly the\nTullys enter the stage all muddied: first of all Edmure Tully (ACOK, Catelyn VI,\nASOS, Catelyn I, and AFFC, Jaime VI), but also the Blackfish (ACOK, Catelyn I).\nCatelyn herself seems positively fond of mud. She fondly remembers baking \u2018mud\npies\u2019 with Lysa and Petyr when they were children, and during her travels in\nAGOT she also gets muddy quite often \u2013 and seems to like it: </p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is\nonly water, Ser Rodrik,\u201d Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a\nloose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild\nshe must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and\nwarm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother\u2019s kisses. It\ntook her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered\nthe godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her\nbrother\u2019s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She\nremembered making <b>mud</b> <b>pies</b>\nwith Lysa, the weight of them, the <b>mud</b> slick and brown between her\nfingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\u2019d eaten so much\n<b>mud</b> he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. (AGOT, Catelyn\nV)</p></blockquote><p>The mud of\nthe river is also the graveyard of the Tullys, as we learn at the \u2018burial\u2019 of\nHoster Tully. </p><blockquote><p>And then it\nwas gone \u2026 drifting downriver still, perhaps, or broken up and sinking. The\nweight of his armor would carry Lord Hoster down to rest in the soft <b>mud</b>\nof the riverbed, in the watery halls where the Tullys held eternal court, with\nschools of fish their last attendants. (ASOS, Catelyn IV)</p></blockquote><p>Catelyn\nherself is resurrected from the mud as Lady Stoneheart when Nymeria drags her\nout of the river (ASOS, Arya XII).</p><p>There is\neven a connection of mud and the Riverlands in F&amp;B: Harren the Black\ncomplains about\u2026 <br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cthese traitors of the Trident, these lords of yellow mud.\u201d (F&amp;B,\nAegon\u2019s conquest).</p></blockquote><p>This should\nbe enough to establish that <b>mud</b> has\na strong <b>Tully connection </b>and therefore it is interesting to look at how mud is\ndepicted in the arcs of Catelyn\u2019s children. <br></p><p>\n2) Sansa and Bran\n\n\n\n<br></p><p>In Sansa\u2019s PoV mud occurs exactly only\nonce as it touches her, and it is no actual mud but just the feeling of not\nbeing able to walk: </p><blockquote><p>She forced\nherself to take King Joffrey\u2019s hand. The climb was something out of a\nnightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of <b>ankle-deep</b> <b>mud</b>, and there were\nmore steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror\nwaiting on the ramparts. (AGOT, Sansa VI)</p></blockquote><p>We have to\ncount out the Mud Gate in King\u2019s Landing. Now, of course Sansa stays mostly\nindoors, and in the Vale she is confronted with snow, not mud, but it is at\nleast worth noting, I think, that mud does not occur often in her POV, not in\nconnection to her anyway.</p><p>Bran\u2019s PoV\ndoesn\u2019t exactly overflow with mud connections either. One very interesting occurrence\nis when he plays with the Frey wards in ACOK. The Freys are the traitors and I would\nalert you to the fact that mud is connected to blood in this case.</p><blockquote><p>\u2026 until\nLittle Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across his belly.\nBefore Bran could blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was <b>blood</b> in the water, the Walders were\nshrieking <b>red</b> murder, Rickon sat in\nthe <b>mud</b> laughing, and Hodor came lumbering in shouting \u201cHodor! Hodor!\nHodor!\u201d (ACOK, Bran I)</p></blockquote><p>So, neither Bran nor Sansa have a very strong Tully/water magic connection. That is completely different for<br></p><p>3) Arya\n\n</p><p>There is no lack of mud, not at all. Interestingly it is in Sansa\u2019s Pov\nthat we see her connection to mud for the first time:</p><blockquote><p>She found\nArya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she\nbrushed dried <b>mud</b> from her fur. (AGOT, Sansa I) </p></blockquote><p>The\ndirewolves give hints about the personas of their owners, and it is extremely\ninteresting that we see Nymeria covered in mud through Sansa\u2019s eyes.</p><p>And I think\nit is interesting that we see her happily playing in the mud, just like Catelyn\ndid:</p><blockquote><p>None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her\nhorsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in <b>mud</b>,\nclutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept\nhoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she\nwas supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for\nthe flowers. That just made her worse. </p><p>Then it turned out the purple\nflowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa would\nhave thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it,\nand the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman\njust because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching. (AGOT, Sansa\nI)</p></blockquote><p>Here we see\nconnection of mud and healing qualities \u2013 which might be a nod to the earth\nmagic.</p><p>I do think that\nArya\u2019s strong connection to mud has multiple purposes: It shows, that Arya, who\nlooks like Ned, also has a very strong connection to her mother, and actually\nis far more similar to her in temper than she is to Ned. Others have made this\nobservation before me: Arya looks like Ned, but is like Catelyn in temper,\nwhile Sansa looks like Catelyn, but has several traits of Ned. I do think that this\nfurther points towards the fact that Arya will meet Lady Stoneheart at one time\nin the book and will be present at the Red Wedding 2.0. (as she was in the\nshow).</p><p>Mud\nrepeatedly occurs to \u2018ground\u2019 Arya when she is on the run. It gives a hint\nabout the people she can trust. When Yoren talks with Ned, and Arya sees him,\nthe man from the Watch who will take her away from King\u2019s Landing he wears <b>mud-cacked\nboots (</b>AGOT, Eddard VII).</p><p>Later when\nArya travels with Yoren, it is Hot Pie, part of her \u2018new\u2019 family who is called\n\u2018mud pie\u2019:</p><blockquote><p>Lommy and\nTarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy <b>mud</b>\nand threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, \u201c<b>Mud</b> Pie! <b>Mud</b>\nPie!\u201d (ACOK, Arya IV).</p></blockquote><p>This is a\nclear connection to Catelyn baking mud pies with her sister.</p><p>In addition,\nArya feels positively good with water and mud:</p><blockquote><p>Despondent,\nshe climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake. The water lapped softly around\nher legs. A few lantern bugs were coming out, their little lights blinking on\nand off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in it. It\ntasted of summer and <b>mud</b> and growing things. Arya plunged her face down\ninto it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned\nback the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt\ngood. (ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>And later\nin the same chapter, crawling in the mud saves her life:</p><blockquote><p>Arya rolled\nheadfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but\nshe didn\u2019t care, the taste was fine, the taste was <b>mud</b> and water and\nworms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing\nbut blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses.\nShe moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to\ncrawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some\nmonstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up\nbehind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the <b>mud</b> on\nthe floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say. \u00a0(ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>Later when\nshe has to walk barefoot she does not mind:</p><blockquote><p>The <b>mud</b>\nwas nice between her toes, and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she\nwalked. (ACOK, Arya V)</p></blockquote><p>Arya is\n- at least it looks like that - directly identified with mud, although the woman might be talking about\nLem here:</p><blockquote><p>The painted\nsign above the door showed a picture of some old king on his knees. Inside was\nthe common room, where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with her\nhands on her hips, glaring. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, boy,\u201d she\nsnapped. \u201cOr are you a girl? Either one, you\u2019re blocking my door. Get in\nor get out. Lem, what did I tell you about my floor? <b>You\u2019re all</b> <b>mud</b>.\u201d (ASOS, Arya II) </p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis interesting that Jaqen as one of the men who seemingly helps Arya has no\nconnection to mud. The magic of the faceless men seems to draw Arya away from\nher family. It is no earth/water magic.</p><p>There is only\none time, where Arya has a distinctively bad feeling about mud. It is a very\nominous dream of Arya, which is a foreshadowing of the Red Wedding and her\ninability to help her family. It is also a back reference to Sansa and her\ninability to help her father (who was already beheaded by the time she walked\nthrough \u2018<b>ankle-deep mud\u2019</b>, forced by Joffrey to look at her father\u2019s head).</p><blockquote><p>She dreamt\nof home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. It was not a good dream, though. She was\nalone outside the castle, <b>up to her\nknees in</b> <b>mud</b>. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when\nshe tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and\nthe castle faded before her, until it looked more like smoke than granite. (ASOS,\nArya III)</p></blockquote><p>Just like\nSansa couldn\u2019t help her father, Arya can\u2019t help her mother and Robb.</p><p>This all cumulates\nin the almost reunion at the Red Wedding where mud occurs very\nfrequently in Arya\u2019s PoV. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cCome\nwith me.\u201d Sandor Clegane reached down a hand. \u201cWe have to get away\nfrom here, and now.\u201d Stranger tossed his head impatiently, his nostrils\nflaring at the scent of blood. The song was done. There was only one solitary\ndrum, its slow monotonous beats echoing across the river like the pounding of\nsome monstrous heart. The black sky wept, the river grumbled, men cursed and\ndied. Arya had <b>mud</b> in her teeth and her face was wet. Rain. It\u2019s only\nrain. That\u2019s all it is. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she shouted. Her voice sounded\nthin and scared, a little girl\u2019s voice. \u201cRobb\u2019s just in the castle, and my\nmother. The gate\u2019s even open.\u201d There were no more Freys riding out. I came\nso far. \u201cWe have to go get my mother.\u201d (ASOS, Arya IX)</p></blockquote><p>The most\nheartbreaking connection of mud to Arya\u2019s family and in particular her mother\nis still to come though: Nymeria drags Catelyn\u2019s corpse from the mud of the\nriver (remember the burial place of the Tullys) but she cannot help Catelyn,\nwho is dead.</p><blockquote><p>\u2026 and\nthen she could smell her. The scent was faint beneath the other smells, beneath\nmoss and <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>, and\nthe stench of rotting reeds and rotting men. She padded slowly through the soft\nground to the river\u2019s edge, lapped up a drink, the lifted her head to sniff.\nThe sky was grey and thick with cloud, the river green and full of floating\nthings. Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water pushed\nthem, others washed up on the banks. \u2026.</p><p>She\nsplashed noisily through the shallows and threw herself into the deeper water,\nher legs churning. The current was strong but she was stronger. She swam,\nfollowing her nose. The river smells were rich and wet, but those were not the\nsmells that pulled her. She paddled after the sharp <b>red</b> whisper of cold blood, the sweet cloying stench of death. She\nchased them as she had often chased a <b>red</b>\ndeer through the trees, and in the end she ran them down, and her jaw closed\naround a pale white arm. She shook it to make it move, but there was only death\nand blood in her mouth. By now she was tiring, and it was all she could do to\npull the body back to shore. As she dragged it up the <b>muddy</b> bank, one of her little brothers came prowling, his tongue\nlolling from his mouth. She had to snarl to drive him off, or else he would\nhave fed. Only then did she stop to shake the water from her fur. The white\nthing lay <b>facedown</b> in the <b>mud</b>,\nher dead flesh wrinkled and pale, cold blood trickling from her throat. Rise,\nshe thought. Rise and eat and run with us. (ASOS, Arya XII)</p></blockquote><p>I do think\nthat the colour <b>red </b>probably is put here to make a connection to the <b>red </b>of the\n<b>Tully </b>mud, and of course the blood that was spilt when Catelyn was killed.</p><p>It is\ninteresting, that as soon as Arya is in Braavos, the occurrence of mud decreases,\nbecause she disconnects with her family. It is also a strong hint, that the\nFaceless men will not be Arya\u2019s family, that she\u2019ll ultimately reject being\npart of them (like she did on the show). It is only in Arya\u2019s dreams, that mud\noccurs:</p><blockquote><p>It was the\nother dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four. In that\none she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of <b>mud</b>\nand blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her\nmother screaming, but a monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save\nher. In that dream she was always weeping, like a frightened little girl. Cats\nnever weep, she told herself, no more than wolves do. It\u2019s just a stupid dream.\n(AFFC, Cat of the Canals)</p></blockquote><p>Clearly,\nthis dream is induced by Arya\u2019s trauma. </p><p>So, mud,\nthe combination of earth and water clearly occurs to \u2018ground\u2019 Arya, to give her\na connection to her mother\u2019s family, which will come into play again, once she\nreturns to Westeros. But the Tully connection, earth/water magic connection is not the only thing that stands out about mud.<br></p><p>\n\n4) Mud and Blood\n\n</p><p>Another interesting\nfind in connection with mud is that there are multiple times that mud and blood\nare connected. In a way, this occurs naturally, the gritty realism of the\nfighting in GRRM\u2019s world is pictured by \u2018dirty\u2019 fights and therefore mud often\noccurs in fights, e.g at the tourney in King\u2019s Landing (AGOT, Eddard VII), or\nRobert\u2019s death (AGOT, Eddard XIII). Also, this fight of Brienne and Jaime might\nbe put here:</p><blockquote><p>Brienne\nlurched to her feet. She was all <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> below the waist, her clothing askew, her face red. She looks\nas if they caught us fucking instead of fighting. (ASOS, Jaime III)</p></blockquote><p>As well as\nthis fight from Asha\u2019s PoV</p><blockquote><p>When he fell, Hagen\u2019s daughter stumbled to her knees, snatched up his sword,\nstabbed the second man, then rose again, smeared with <b>blood</b> and <b>mud</b>, her long red hair unbound, and plunged into\nthe fight. (ADWD, The Wayward bride)</p></blockquote><p>So, these\nare just two examples where the mud adds to the \u2018dirtyness\u2019 of fighting, there\nare many more.</p><p>\n\n5) Mud and slipping/falling\n\n</p><p>A very\nspecial case of mud and fighting is when a fight ends with someone lying in the\nmud. Over the course of ASOIAF several people come to lay in the mud, wounded,\nhurt or near to death, and I think this might be way to alert us to a\nconnection of mud and death.</p><p>The very\nfirst time is in the prologue \u2013 which is also a foreshadowing of Jon\u2019s death as <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a> has shown:</p><blockquote><p>The great sentinel was right\nthere at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest\nbranches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly\nin the snow and the <b>mud</b>, and looked down on the empty clearing below. (AGOT,\nPrologue)</p></blockquote><p>When Ned\nand Jaime fight, Ned falls from his horse and lies in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Ned\u2019s horse\nslipped under him and came crashing down in the <b>mud</b>. There was a moment\nof blinding pain and the taste of <b>blood</b>\nin his mouth. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When he\nopened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. His horse\nmoved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to\ndrag himself through the <b>mud</b>, gritting his teeth at the agony in his\nleg. It seemed to take years. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion also\nhas a <b>muddy</b> experience in his first\nbattle:</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion\nlurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse\u2019s belly. The animal gave a\nhideous scream and reared. It tried to twist away from the agony, a shower of <b>blood</b> and viscera poured down over\nTyrion\u2019s face, and the horse fell like an avalanche. The next he knew, his\nvisor was packed with <b>mud</b> and something was crushing his foot. He\nwriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk. \u201c\u2026 yield \u2026\u201d\nhe managed to croak faintly. (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)) </p></blockquote><p>Several\npeople land on their arses in the mud, which is not necessarily connected to dying.\nArya does when she travels with the hound (ASOS, Arya XI), Podrick Payne falls\nin the mud, when Brienne catches him spying on her (AFFC, Brienne II) and Jaime\nkisses the muddy ground in his training exercise with Ser Ilyn (AFFC, Jaime V).</p><p>Yet, coming\nto fall in the mud, might be considered a bad omen, or at least a sign of sudden change. I think that <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> connected are not only there to convey a \u2018dirty\u2019 fight, but\nalso to foreshadow bad things to come. It is no happenstance that Ned falls\ninto the mud when he is confronted by Jaime Lannister in the streets of King\u2019s\nLanding.</p><p>It is\ninteresting that we see Ser Criston Cole, the commander of the King\u2019s Guard,\nand in part a Jaime stand-in, actually killing a man in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Cole\u2019s\nfavorite weapon was the Morningstar, and the blows he rained done on Ser\nLaenor\u2019s champion cracked his helm and left him senseless in the mud. Borne\nbloody from the field, Ser Joffrey died without recovering consciousness six\ndays later. (F&amp;B, Heirs of the dragon)</p></blockquote><p>The scene\nwith the most ominous foreshadowing is Jon: He is thrown into the mud, when he\nis attacked by Orell\u2019s eagle. Jon\u2019s fall and death and loss of an eye (on this compare <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHV0A6XAqV1AbH1L0Bo2Bw\">@rose-of-red-lake</a>) are\nforeshadowed several times, and Ned\u2019s fall into the mud might be another hint\nto Jon\u2019s falling, which we see here:<br></p><p>The next he\nknew, he was <b>on his face</b> with the\ntaste of <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> in his\nmouth and Ygritte kneeling over him protectively, a bone dagger in her hand. He\ncould still hear wings, though the eagle was not in sight. Half his world was\nblack. \u201cMy eye,\u201d he said in sudden panic, raising a hand to his face.\n\u2026. \u201cThere\u2019s your hellcrow!\u201d Rattleshirt pointed at Jon.\n\u201cBleeding in the <b>mud</b> like a faithless dog!\u201d The eagle came\nflapping down to land atop the broken giant\u2019s skull that served him for his\nhelm. \u201cI\u2019m here for him.\u201d (ASOS, Jon II)</p><p>I would\nalert you to the fact that Duncan the Tall in the Hedge Knight also has a scene\nwith mud and blood \u2013 and he is temporarily blinded by blood in his eye.</p><blockquote><p>When his\neyes opened he was on the ground again, sprawled on his back. The <b>mud</b>\nhad all been knocked from his helm, but now one eye was closed by <b>blood</b>. Above was nothing but dark grey\nsky. (The Hedge Knight)</p></blockquote><p>A variant\nof this mud and blood connection is, when Khal Drogo is dying. He does not lie\nin the mud, but the mud plasters on his wound get mixed with blood. </p><blockquote><p>When they\nwere alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy surprising in\nsuch a big man, he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried <b>blue</b> <b>mud</b> from Drogo\u2019s chest. The\nplaster had caked hard as the <b>mud</b> walls of the Lamb Men, and like those\nwalls it cracked easily. Ser Jorah broke the dry <b>mud</b> with his knife,\npried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul,\nsweet smell rose from the wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were\ncrusted with <b>blood</b> and pus, Drogo\u2019s\nbreast black and glistening with corruption. (AGOT, Daenerys VIII)</p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis extremely interesting that the mud, that was used to cover his wounds is of\nblue colour, a Tully colour maybe? </p><p>\n\n5) Mud and death\n\n</p><p>But this is\nnot all there is to \u2018mud\u2019. We have seen sliding in the \u2018mud\u2019 is a real danger\nfor anyone fighting, but mud can be deadly in other ways as well:</p><p>During\ntheir travels Brienne and Podrick chance upon dangerous mud: </p><blockquote><p>\u201cStay off the mud, child,\u201d counseled Septon Meribald. \u201cThe\nmud is not fond of strangers. If you walk in the wrong place, it will open up\nand swallow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only <b>mud</b>,\u201d insisted Podrick. </p><p><b>\u201cUntil it fills your mouth and starts creeping up your nose. Then it\u2019s\ndeath.\u201d </b>He smiled to take the chill\noff his words. \u201cWipe off that mud and have a slice of orange, lad.\u201d\n(AFFC, Brienne V)</p></blockquote><p>And later:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf\nyou would sleep beneath a roof tonight, you must climb off your horses and\ncross the <b>mud</b> with me. The path of faith, we call it. Only the faithful\nmay cross safely. The wicked are swallowed by the quicksands, or drowned when\nthe tide comes rushing in. None of you are wicked, I hope? Even so, I would be\ncareful where I set my feet. Walk only where I walk, and you shall reach the\nother side.\u201d (AFFC, Brienne VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is\neven mud in connection with quicksands in one of Sansa\u2019s chapters, the only\ntime apart from her walking towards the rampart as if through ankle-deep mud,\nwhere mud has an appearance in her chapters and is not connected to Arya:</p><blockquote><p>Huge\nflowers bloomed in the <b>mud</b> and floated on pools of stagnant water, but\nif you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were\nquicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and\nlizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes\nand teeth. (AGOT, Sansa I)</p></blockquote><p>Ser Davos\nhas a near death experience after the Battle of the Blackwater and the mud\nproves dangerous in this case as well.</p><blockquote><p>Panic took\nhold of him. His hands flailed against the bottom of the river and sent up a\ncloud of <b>mud</b> that blinded him. His chest was growing tighter by the\ninstant. He clawed at the water, kicking, pushing himself, turning, his lungs\nscreaming for air, kicking, kicking, lost now in the river murk, kicking,\nkicking, kicking until he could kick no longer. When he opened his mouth to\nscream, the water came rushing in, tasting of salt, and Davos Seaworth knew\nthat he was drowning. (ASOS Davos I)</p></blockquote><p>The\nincident in F&amp;B, where an archmaester dies of slipping in the mud, might be\na hint as well: </p><blockquote><p>He proved\nmore robust than his predecessor, serving the realm until 12 AC, when he\nslipped in the mud, broke his hip, and died soon thereafter\u2026. (F&amp;B, Three\nheads had the dragon) <br></p></blockquote><p>I mean this might be coincidence, but GRRM could have\nsimply said: He took a fall?</p><p>So, what is\nit with dangerous mud? Is this a hint that Arya will become very deadly indeed? <br></p><p>There is yet another thing, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what to make of it:<br></p><p>6) Mud and (horse)shit\n\n</p><p>Another\ninteresting tidbit is this scene with Theon on Pyke</p><blockquote><p>Theon knelt. He had a\npurpose here, and might need Aeron\u2019s help to achieve it. A crown was worth a\nlittle <b>mud</b> and horseshit on his breeches, he supposed. (ACOK, Theon I)</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0- a very\nstrange wording and connection of mud and shit, but one that happens again, with\nJon of all people: </p><blockquote><p>Go on, I\u2019ll\nsee to your horse. If it\u2019s warm and dry inside, don\u2019t tell me, I wasn\u2019t asked\nin.\u201c He flicked a glob of wet <b>mud</b> out from under a horseshoe.\n\"Does this <b>mud</b> look like shit to you? Could it be that this whole\nhill is made of Craster\u2019s shit?\u201d (ACOK, Jon III).</p></blockquote><p>I would\nlike to link this to the following from Catelyn\u2019s chapters:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe distance between a lord and a grace is a small one, my\nlady,\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cLord Renly wears a crown, as does my son. If\nyou wish, we may stand here in the <b>mud</b> and debate what honors and titles\nare rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters\nto consider.\u201d (ACOK, Catelyn II)</p></blockquote><p>Is this a\nhint to the debate to come when the lords will discuss Jon\u2019s claim to the\ncrown? </p><p>So mud\nmight be even involved with the making of a king? This is admittedly very\ntinfoily\u2026.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud as a part of nature\n\n</p><p>Another\nvery prominent occurrence of mud is the connection of mud with Prince Quentyn,\nthe \u2018wrong suitor\u2019, the frog prince who was not saved by princess Dany but\nfailed in his bride quest. This is what Barristan has to say about Quentyn\nbeing mud :</p><blockquote><p>She wants\nfire, and Dorne sent her <b>mud</b>. </p><p>You could\nmake a poultice out of <b>mud</b> to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in <b>mud</b>\nand grow a crop to feed your children. <b>Mud</b> would nourish you, where fire\nwould only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose\nfire every time. (ADWD, the discarded knight)</p></blockquote><p>Here mud\nhas very positive connotations, something that connects mud to healing and\nfertility.</p><p>So, mud is\nmuch more dangerous than people allow for, but is also good. It\u2019s not just\nwater and earth, there is more to it and maybe even the connection of mud and\ndeath might have a positive aspect:</p><p>Firewights\nof Rh\u2019llor and the icewights of the Others are unnatural, and if it is indeed\nArya\u2019s fate to come to a deeper understanding of mercy, justice and revenge, then\nthe final death of Lady Stoneheart \u2013 which she probably will witness \u2013 brings\nthe natural order back. </p><p>I suggest that mud might point not only to Tullys, to danger and to\ndeath, but that it might also point towards a fall and a sudden change.</p><p>Arya is the\n\u2018wild card\u2019. Where her allegiance lies, will probably be crucial, and the\ndespised mud might become dangerous up to a point where the mud can suffocate and\nkill someone.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud and danger\n\n</p><p>Finally, I\nwould alert you to some ominous foreshadowing of mud and water besides the\nconnection to Khal Drogo\u2019s death I have discussed already.</p><p>Mud\nfeatures heavily in the tragic story of Da\u20acnerys, Drogo and Mirri Maaz Duur.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI\nmeant no wrong, fierce riders.\u201d The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes\nshe wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with\nembroidery, but now they were <b>mud</b>-caked and bloody and ripped. She\nclutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. \u201cI have some\nsmall skill in the healing arts.\u201d (AGOT, Daenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>Mirri is a healer, and it is interesting that her and her magic (we only see her practicing blood magic, but it stands to reason that her normal way of magic would be \u2018earth-bound\u2019).<br></p><blockquote><p>Khal Drogo\nwaved him away. \u201cI need no man\u2019s help,\u201d he said, in a voice proud and\nhard. He stood, unaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood ran down\nhis breast, from where Ogo\u2019s arakh had cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly\nto his side. \u201cI am no man,\u201d she whispered, \u201cso you may lean on\nme.\u201d Drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as\nthey walked toward the great <b>mud</b> temple. The three bloodriders followed.\nDany commanded Ser Jorah and the warriors of her khas to guard the entrance and\nmake certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside. (AGOT,\nDaenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>I would\nalert you to the fact, that Khal Drogo burns the <b>mud</b> temple of the Lamb people. So, MMD connected to mud via her\nreligion \u2013 which is a religion that seems to be heavily influenced by earth and\nnature worship\u00a0\n\u2013\n\n is an antagonist of Da\u20acnerys.</p><p>Considering\nthat Da\u20acnerys lives in a hot climate, the rare occurrence of mud may alert us to\nimportant crossroads of her arc.</p><blockquote><p>The\nprocession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled\nclothing fall to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri\nsaid the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft <b>mud</b> <b>squishing between her toes</b> as she pushed through the tall reeds.\nThe moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her\nripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness\ncrept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion\u2019s blood had dried\non her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the\nsacred waters over her head, cleansing herself and the child inside her while\nthe khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the dosh khaleen\nmuttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying. (AGOT,\nDa\u20acnerys V)</p></blockquote><p>This\nhappens after Da\u20acnerys ate the horse heart and awaits the dosh khaleen\u2019s\nprophecy on the future of her child, the \u201cstallion who mounts the world\u201d. This\nis when Viserys dies and she sets herself on the path towards winning the Iron\nThrone for herself.</p><p>In her last\nchapter in ADWD (Da\u20acnerys X) there is a recollection of the time she was\npregnant with Rhaego:</p><blockquote><p>It was\nquiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed\nagainst each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now\nand again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. <b>Mud</b>\n<b>squished between her toes</b>. Insects\nbuzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps and stinging\nmidges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they landed\non her arms.</p></blockquote><p>Her last\nchapter in ADWD is also important, because she really embraces her house words\n\u2018fire and blood\u2019, the last step in her transition from a frightened child to a\nruthless conqueror. This is also the chapter, where we see her possibly having\na miscarriage:</p><blockquote><p>Her belly\nwas empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping\nhad grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels.\nShe scooped up a handful of <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>\nin trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid, but in the chill of\ndawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she splashed her\nface, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic was\nstained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it\u2019s only\nmy moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. <b>Could it be the water? If it was the water,\nshe was doomed</b>. She had to drink or die of thirst. (ADWD Daenerys X)</p></blockquote><p>Very\ntentatively I would suggest that \u2018mud\u2019 and/ or water does not bode well for\nDa\u20acnerys. <b>If it was the water, she was\ndoomed.</b> Who has the strongest connection to the Riverlands? Who is a\nwaterdancer? Arya, the wild card, will be threat to Da\u20acnerys I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>To sum up:</p><p>Mud as a\ncombination of earth and water has a connection to the CotF and might be usable\nto balance the dangerous opposites of fire and ice.</p><p>Mud is a\ntell-tale Tully word. The red mud of the river is a sign for Tully, and it\nshows clearly that appearances put aside, Arya is the child that is most\nclosely connected to the Tully and the Riverlands and will probably witness the\nRed Wedding 2.0. and the final death of the unnaturally resurrected Lady\nStoneheart. Arya possibly will choose mud over fire.</p><p>Mud and\nblood are used repeatedly \u2013 and many more times when I put down here as\nexamples \u2013 to picture the dirtiness of fighting. Mud also has healing\nqualities, but can be dangerous as well (as every magic). We see this rarely,\nbut nevertheless in every book and in several PoVs.</p><p>There is a\nconnection between mud and death. Slipping in the mud can mean a sudden change\nto a fight and deadly danger. I would alert you to the fact that the healing\nqualities of mud only go awry when the healing women of the Dothraki fail to\nheal Khal Drogo.</p><p>Looking at\nDa\u20acnerys\u2019 arc I would say that mud does not bode well for her. Mud as a\nreminder of a more grounded life occurs at several crossroads in her arc,\nshortly before Viserys\u2019 death, with MMD, with the rejection of Quentyn\u2019s offer\nof marriage and the decision for her house words in her last chapter in ADWD. I\nthink it points towards the fact that the very personification of \u2018mud\u2019, Arya\nStark will cause a turn in Da\u20acnerys\u2019 story. I do think it is a further hint\nthat Arya will be the death of Da\u20acnerys. </p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>In ASOIAF\nwe have two very obvious sources of magic: The Ice of the WW north of the Wall\nand the fire that is present in the dragons and Rh\u2019llors magic. Both magics\nseem to be very strong \u2013 both the WW and the servants of Rh\u2019llor can resurrect\nthe dead \u2013 producing ice wights or fire wights, respectively.</p><p>It has\npuzzled me for some time, that as regards to the traditional four elements\n\u201cearth, fire, air and water\u201d, the two opposites \u201cice and fire\u201d do not exactly\nmatch. Fire obviously melts ice, but then ice becomes water that will\nextinguish the fire in turn. So, why ice and not water as an opposite to fire?</p><p>I put this under the cut because it became huge\u2026</p>[[MORE]]<p>The show\ngave us a big hint as to the origins of the White Walkers. We saw the Children\nof the Forest make the first White Walker aka the Night King, and it seems\npretty clear, that the WW \u2013 at least in the show \u2013 are an experiment of the CotF\nthat has gone awry. The CotF woke ice magic and it developed an agenda of its\nown. It can be argued that the books might go in the same direction. There are\nhints that the Others are a problem the CotF created and that they finally\nallied with the First men to get rid of the threat \u2013 and did not succeed\nentirely. </p><p>So, ice\nmagic might be a variant of earth and water (or nature) magic, that has spiralled\nout of control. This instigated me to look at what we have in regard to earth\nmagic and water magic.</p><p>I do think\nthat from the description of the CotF in AWOIAF it is pretty clear, that the\nCotF do have an element of nature and earth magic.</p><blockquote><p>The gods\nthe children worshipped were the nameless ones that would one day become the\ngods of the First Men\u2014the innumerable gods of <b>the streams and forests and stones</b>. (AWOIAF, The Dawn Age)</p></blockquote><p>And also in\nBran\u2019s PoV we have some hints to earth magic, most blatantly in the oath of\nJojen and Meera Reed, who as \u2018frog-eaters\u2019 from the Neck have very close\nconnection to nature. In addition, their small stature probably makes them\nstand-ins for the CotF if not even descendants. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI swear it by <b>earth</b> and <b>water</b>,\u201d said the boy in green.</p><p>\u201cI swear it by bronze and iron,\u201d\nhis sister said. </p><p>\u201cWe swear it by <b>ice</b> and <b>fire</b>,\u201d they finished together.</p><p> (ACOK, Bran III)</p></blockquote><p>This oath\nis surely a fogged memory about the first oath between CotF and the First men.\nEarth and Water is the magic of the CotF, bronze and iron are weapons (iron in\nlegends being specifically a weapon of men, not to be used by the faerie, elves\nor however you want to call them) and ice and fire is the common enemy. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo,\u201d\nsaid Meera, \u201cbut he could <b>breathe mud</b> and <b>run on leaves</b>, and change <b>earth</b>\nto <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> to <b>earth</b> with no\nmore than a whispered word. He could talk to trees and weave words and make\ncastles appear and disappear.\u201d (ASOS, Bran II)</p></blockquote><p>Here Meera\ntalks about her father, or rather about the legendary version of him. I would\nalert you to the fact, that earth and water are interchangeable and that there\nis an obvious stage of transmission as mud. </p><p>Also Bran\u2019s\nexperience while warging summer have a very earthy and magical vibe to them:</p><blockquote><p>The\nevening\u2019s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and\nstrong again. Grass and thorns, blackberries broken on the ground, mud, worms, rotting leaves, a rat\ncreeping through the bush. He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother\u2019s\ncoat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he\u2019d killed. Other\nsquirrels moved through the branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, their\nlittle claws scratching at the bark. The noise had sounded something like that.\n(ACOK, Bran VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is also the very real magical moment Jon experiences north of the\nwall, when he is at a place where the CotF might have influence. <br></p><blockquote><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every\nblade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond.\nFlowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. <b>Even the mud puddles had\na bright brown sheen</b>. Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of\nhis brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice. </p><p>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all. He found himself thinking of\nhis sisters, perhaps because he\u2019d dreamed of them last night. Sansa would call\nthis an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but\nArya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all. (ACOK, Jon\nIII)</p></blockquote><p>Now, this\nmade me wonder again, how earth and water come into play for the arcs of our\ncharacters in ASOIAF and that in turn led me to look at the Tullys and the word\n\u201c<b>mud</b>\u201d \u2013 the connection of earth and\nwater and I think I found some connections that might be worth pondering. </p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> told\nme to be cautious about that, because, you know, mud happens if it rains, and\nit is no wonder that we see mud a lot in some of the PoVs, but still there are\nsome interesting observations to be made. So, my following deliberations are\nnot based on every mention of the word \u2018mud\u2019, because I would argue that sometimes\n\u2018mud\u2019 is just \u2018mud\u2019 and not a hint to the earth and water magic.</p><p>\n\n1) Tully mud\n\n</p><p>First of\nall, the observation that stuck out most to me is that mud is connected to the\nTullys and the Riverlands, explicitly and repeatedly. And it is a sort of\nreddish mud: red mud and blue water are the Tully colours.</p><blockquote><p>Catelyn raised her eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a\npath across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god.\n\u201cThe Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a <b>red</b> flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure\nthinks it\u2019s an omen of victory for Riverrun\u2014he sees a fish with a long tail, in\nthe Tully colors, red against blue.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI wish I had their\nfaith. Crimson is a Lannister color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing\u2019s not crimson,\u201d Ser Brynden said. \u201cNor Tully\nred, the <b>mud</b> <b>red</b> of the\nriver. That\u2019s <b>blood</b> up there, child,\nsmeared across the sky.\u201d(ACOK, Catelyn I)</p></blockquote><p>Repeatedly the\nTullys enter the stage all muddied: first of all Edmure Tully (ACOK, Catelyn VI,\nASOS, Catelyn I, and AFFC, Jaime VI), but also the Blackfish (ACOK, Catelyn I).\nCatelyn herself seems positively fond of mud. She fondly remembers baking \u2018mud\npies\u2019 with Lysa and Petyr when they were children, and during her travels in\nAGOT she also gets muddy quite often \u2013 and seems to like it: </p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is\nonly water, Ser Rodrik,\u201d Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a\nloose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild\nshe must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and\nwarm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother\u2019s kisses. It\ntook her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered\nthe godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her\nbrother\u2019s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She\nremembered making <b>mud</b> <b>pies</b>\nwith Lysa, the weight of them, the <b>mud</b> slick and brown between her\nfingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\u2019d eaten so much\n<b>mud</b> he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. (AGOT, Catelyn\nV)</p></blockquote><p>The mud of\nthe river is also the graveyard of the Tullys, as we learn at the \u2018burial\u2019 of\nHoster Tully. </p><blockquote><p>And then it\nwas gone \u2026 drifting downriver still, perhaps, or broken up and sinking. The\nweight of his armor would carry Lord Hoster down to rest in the soft <b>mud</b>\nof the riverbed, in the watery halls where the Tullys held eternal court, with\nschools of fish their last attendants. (ASOS, Catelyn IV)</p></blockquote><p>Catelyn\nherself is resurrected from the mud as Lady Stoneheart when Nymeria drags her\nout of the river (ASOS, Arya XII).</p><p>There is\neven a connection of mud and the Riverlands in F&amp;B: Harren the Black\ncomplains about\u2026 <br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cthese traitors of the Trident, these lords of yellow mud.\u201d (F&amp;B,\nAegon\u2019s conquest).</p></blockquote><p>This should\nbe enough to establish that <b>mud</b> has\na strong <b>Tully connection </b>and therefore it is interesting to look at how mud is\ndepicted in the arcs of Catelyn\u2019s children. <br></p><p>\n2) Sansa and Bran\n\n\n\n<br></p><p>In Sansa\u2019s PoV mud occurs exactly only\nonce as it touches her, and it is no actual mud but just the feeling of not\nbeing able to walk: </p><blockquote><p>She forced\nherself to take King Joffrey\u2019s hand. The climb was something out of a\nnightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of <b>ankle-deep</b> <b>mud</b>, and there were\nmore steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror\nwaiting on the ramparts. (AGOT, Sansa VI)</p></blockquote><p>We have to\ncount out the Mud Gate in King\u2019s Landing. Now, of course Sansa stays mostly\nindoors, and in the Vale she is confronted with snow, not mud, but it is at\nleast worth noting, I think, that mud does not occur often in her POV, not in\nconnection to her anyway.</p><p>Bran\u2019s PoV\ndoesn\u2019t exactly overflow with mud connections either. One very interesting occurrence\nis when he plays with the Frey wards in ACOK. The Freys are the traitors and I would\nalert you to the fact that mud is connected to blood in this case.</p><blockquote><p>\u2026 until\nLittle Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across his belly.\nBefore Bran could blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was <b>blood</b> in the water, the Walders were\nshrieking <b>red</b> murder, Rickon sat in\nthe <b>mud</b> laughing, and Hodor came lumbering in shouting \u201cHodor! Hodor!\nHodor!\u201d (ACOK, Bran I)</p></blockquote><p>So, neither Bran nor Sansa have a very strong Tully/water magic connection. That is completely different for<br></p><p>3) Arya\n\n</p><p>There is no lack of mud, not at all. Interestingly it is in Sansa\u2019s Pov\nthat we see her connection to mud for the first time:</p><blockquote><p>She found\nArya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she\nbrushed dried <b>mud</b> from her fur. (AGOT, Sansa I) </p></blockquote><p>The\ndirewolves give hints about the personas of their owners, and it is extremely\ninteresting that we see Nymeria covered in mud through Sansa\u2019s eyes.</p><p>And I think\nit is interesting that we see her happily playing in the mud, just like Catelyn\ndid:</p><blockquote><p>None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her\nhorsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in <b>mud</b>,\nclutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept\nhoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she\nwas supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for\nthe flowers. That just made her worse. </p><p>Then it turned out the purple\nflowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa would\nhave thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it,\nand the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman\njust because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching. (AGOT, Sansa\nI)</p></blockquote><p>Here we see\nconnection of mud and healing qualities \u2013 which might be a nod to the earth\nmagic.</p><p>I do think that\nArya\u2019s strong connection to mud has multiple purposes: It shows, that Arya, who\nlooks like Ned, also has a very strong connection to her mother, and actually\nis far more similar to her in temper than she is to Ned. Others have made this\nobservation before me: Arya looks like Ned, but is like Catelyn in temper,\nwhile Sansa looks like Catelyn, but has several traits of Ned. I do think that this\nfurther points towards the fact that Arya will meet Lady Stoneheart at one time\nin the book and will be present at the Red Wedding 2.0. (as she was in the\nshow).</p><p>Mud\nrepeatedly occurs to \u2018ground\u2019 Arya when she is on the run. It gives a hint\nabout the people she can trust. When Yoren talks with Ned, and Arya sees him,\nthe man from the Watch who will take her away from King\u2019s Landing he wears <b>mud-cacked\nboots (</b>AGOT, Eddard VII).</p><p>Later when\nArya travels with Yoren, it is Hot Pie, part of her \u2018new\u2019 family who is called\n\u2018mud pie\u2019:</p><blockquote><p>Lommy and\nTarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy <b>mud</b>\nand threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, \u201c<b>Mud</b> Pie! <b>Mud</b>\nPie!\u201d (ACOK, Arya IV).</p></blockquote><p>This is a\nclear connection to Catelyn baking mud pies with her sister.</p><p>In addition,\nArya feels positively good with water and mud:</p><blockquote><p>Despondent,\nshe climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake. The water lapped softly around\nher legs. A few lantern bugs were coming out, their little lights blinking on\nand off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in it. It\ntasted of summer and <b>mud</b> and growing things. Arya plunged her face down\ninto it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned\nback the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt\ngood. (ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>And later\nin the same chapter, crawling in the mud saves her life:</p><blockquote><p>Arya rolled\nheadfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but\nshe didn\u2019t care, the taste was fine, the taste was <b>mud</b> and water and\nworms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing\nbut blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses.\nShe moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to\ncrawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some\nmonstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up\nbehind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the <b>mud</b> on\nthe floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say. \u00a0(ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>Later when\nshe has to walk barefoot she does not mind:</p><blockquote><p>The <b>mud</b>\nwas nice between her toes, and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she\nwalked. (ACOK, Arya V)</p></blockquote><p>Arya is\n- at least it looks like that - directly identified with mud, although the woman might be talking about\nLem here:</p><blockquote><p>The painted\nsign above the door showed a picture of some old king on his knees. Inside was\nthe common room, where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with her\nhands on her hips, glaring. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, boy,\u201d she\nsnapped. \u201cOr are you a girl? Either one, you\u2019re blocking my door. Get in\nor get out. Lem, what did I tell you about my floor? <b>You\u2019re all</b> <b>mud</b>.\u201d (ASOS, Arya II) </p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis interesting that Jaqen as one of the men who seemingly helps Arya has no\nconnection to mud. The magic of the faceless men seems to draw Arya away from\nher family. It is no earth/water magic.</p><p>There is only\none time, where Arya has a distinctively bad feeling about mud. It is a very\nominous dream of Arya, which is a foreshadowing of the Red Wedding and her\ninability to help her family. It is also a back reference to Sansa and her\ninability to help her father (who was already beheaded by the time she walked\nthrough \u2018<b>ankle-deep mud\u2019</b>, forced by Joffrey to look at her father\u2019s head).</p><blockquote><p>She dreamt\nof home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. It was not a good dream, though. She was\nalone outside the castle, <b>up to her\nknees in</b> <b>mud</b>. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when\nshe tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and\nthe castle faded before her, until it looked more like smoke than granite. (ASOS,\nArya III)</p></blockquote><p>Just like\nSansa couldn\u2019t help her father, Arya can\u2019t help her mother and Robb.</p><p>This all cumulates\nin the almost reunion at the Red Wedding where mud occurs very\nfrequently in Arya\u2019s PoV. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cCome\nwith me.\u201d Sandor Clegane reached down a hand. \u201cWe have to get away\nfrom here, and now.\u201d Stranger tossed his head impatiently, his nostrils\nflaring at the scent of blood. The song was done. There was only one solitary\ndrum, its slow monotonous beats echoing across the river like the pounding of\nsome monstrous heart. The black sky wept, the river grumbled, men cursed and\ndied. Arya had <b>mud</b> in her teeth and her face was wet. Rain. It\u2019s only\nrain. That\u2019s all it is. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she shouted. Her voice sounded\nthin and scared, a little girl\u2019s voice. \u201cRobb\u2019s just in the castle, and my\nmother. The gate\u2019s even open.\u201d There were no more Freys riding out. I came\nso far. \u201cWe have to go get my mother.\u201d (ASOS, Arya IX)</p></blockquote><p>The most\nheartbreaking connection of mud to Arya\u2019s family and in particular her mother\nis still to come though: Nymeria drags Catelyn\u2019s corpse from the mud of the\nriver (remember the burial place of the Tullys) but she cannot help Catelyn,\nwho is dead.</p><blockquote><p>\u2026 and\nthen she could smell her. The scent was faint beneath the other smells, beneath\nmoss and <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>, and\nthe stench of rotting reeds and rotting men. She padded slowly through the soft\nground to the river\u2019s edge, lapped up a drink, the lifted her head to sniff.\nThe sky was grey and thick with cloud, the river green and full of floating\nthings. Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water pushed\nthem, others washed up on the banks. \u2026.</p><p>She\nsplashed noisily through the shallows and threw herself into the deeper water,\nher legs churning. The current was strong but she was stronger. She swam,\nfollowing her nose. The river smells were rich and wet, but those were not the\nsmells that pulled her. She paddled after the sharp <b>red</b> whisper of cold blood, the sweet cloying stench of death. She\nchased them as she had often chased a <b>red</b>\ndeer through the trees, and in the end she ran them down, and her jaw closed\naround a pale white arm. She shook it to make it move, but there was only death\nand blood in her mouth. By now she was tiring, and it was all she could do to\npull the body back to shore. As she dragged it up the <b>muddy</b> bank, one of her little brothers came prowling, his tongue\nlolling from his mouth. She had to snarl to drive him off, or else he would\nhave fed. Only then did she stop to shake the water from her fur. The white\nthing lay <b>facedown</b> in the <b>mud</b>,\nher dead flesh wrinkled and pale, cold blood trickling from her throat. Rise,\nshe thought. Rise and eat and run with us. (ASOS, Arya XII)</p></blockquote><p>I do think\nthat the colour <b>red </b>probably is put here to make a connection to the <b>red </b>of the\n<b>Tully </b>mud, and of course the blood that was spilt when Catelyn was killed.</p><p>It is\ninteresting, that as soon as Arya is in Braavos, the occurrence of mud decreases,\nbecause she disconnects with her family. It is also a strong hint, that the\nFaceless men will not be Arya\u2019s family, that she\u2019ll ultimately reject being\npart of them (like she did on the show). It is only in Arya\u2019s dreams, that mud\noccurs:</p><blockquote><p>It was the\nother dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four. In that\none she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of <b>mud</b>\nand blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her\nmother screaming, but a monster with a dog\u2019s head would not let her go save\nher. In that dream she was always weeping, like a frightened little girl. Cats\nnever weep, she told herself, no more than wolves do. It\u2019s just a stupid dream.\n(AFFC, Cat of the Canals)</p></blockquote><p>Clearly,\nthis dream is induced by Arya\u2019s trauma. </p><p>So, mud,\nthe combination of earth and water clearly occurs to \u2018ground\u2019 Arya, to give her\na connection to her mother\u2019s family, which will come into play again, once she\nreturns to Westeros. But the Tully connection, earth/water magic connection is not the only thing that stands out about mud.<br></p><p>\n\n4) Mud and Blood\n\n</p><p>Another interesting\nfind in connection with mud is that there are multiple times that mud and blood\nare connected. In a way, this occurs naturally, the gritty realism of the\nfighting in GRRM\u2019s world is pictured by \u2018dirty\u2019 fights and therefore mud often\noccurs in fights, e.g at the tourney in King\u2019s Landing (AGOT, Eddard VII), or\nRobert\u2019s death (AGOT, Eddard XIII). Also, this fight of Brienne and Jaime might\nbe put here:</p><blockquote><p>Brienne\nlurched to her feet. She was all <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> below the waist, her clothing askew, her face red. She looks\nas if they caught us fucking instead of fighting. (ASOS, Jaime III)</p></blockquote><p>As well as\nthis fight from Asha\u2019s PoV</p><blockquote><p>When he fell, Hagen\u2019s daughter stumbled to her knees, snatched up his sword,\nstabbed the second man, then rose again, smeared with <b>blood</b> and <b>mud</b>, her long red hair unbound, and plunged into\nthe fight. (ADWD, The Wayward bride)</p></blockquote><p>So, these\nare just two examples where the mud adds to the \u2018dirtyness\u2019 of fighting, there\nare many more.</p><p>\n\n5) Mud and slipping/falling\n\n</p><p>A very\nspecial case of mud and fighting is when a fight ends with someone lying in the\nmud. Over the course of ASOIAF several people come to lay in the mud, wounded,\nhurt or near to death, and I think this might be way to alert us to a\nconnection of mud and death.</p><p>The very\nfirst time is in the prologue \u2013 which is also a foreshadowing of Jon\u2019s death as <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a> has shown:</p><blockquote><p>The great sentinel was right\nthere at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest\nbranches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly\nin the snow and the <b>mud</b>, and looked down on the empty clearing below. (AGOT,\nPrologue)</p></blockquote><p>When Ned\nand Jaime fight, Ned falls from his horse and lies in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Ned\u2019s horse\nslipped under him and came crashing down in the <b>mud</b>. There was a moment\nof blinding pain and the taste of <b>blood</b>\nin his mouth. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When he\nopened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. His horse\nmoved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to\ndrag himself through the <b>mud</b>, gritting his teeth at the agony in his\nleg. It seemed to take years. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion also\nhas a <b>muddy</b> experience in his first\nbattle:</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion\nlurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse\u2019s belly. The animal gave a\nhideous scream and reared. It tried to twist away from the agony, a shower of <b>blood</b> and viscera poured down over\nTyrion\u2019s face, and the horse fell like an avalanche. The next he knew, his\nvisor was packed with <b>mud</b> and something was crushing his foot. He\nwriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk. \u201c\u2026 yield \u2026\u201d\nhe managed to croak faintly. (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)) </p></blockquote><p>Several\npeople land on their arses in the mud, which is not necessarily connected to dying.\nArya does when she travels with the hound (ASOS, Arya XI), Podrick Payne falls\nin the mud, when Brienne catches him spying on her (AFFC, Brienne II) and Jaime\nkisses the muddy ground in his training exercise with Ser Ilyn (AFFC, Jaime V).</p><p>Yet, coming\nto fall in the mud, might be considered a bad omen, or at least a sign of sudden change. I think that <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> connected are not only there to convey a \u2018dirty\u2019 fight, but\nalso to foreshadow bad things to come. It is no happenstance that Ned falls\ninto the mud when he is confronted by Jaime Lannister in the streets of King\u2019s\nLanding.</p><p>It is\ninteresting that we see Ser Criston Cole, the commander of the King\u2019s Guard,\nand in part a Jaime stand-in, actually killing a man in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Cole\u2019s\nfavorite weapon was the Morningstar, and the blows he rained done on Ser\nLaenor\u2019s champion cracked his helm and left him senseless in the mud. Borne\nbloody from the field, Ser Joffrey died without recovering consciousness six\ndays later. (F&amp;B, Heirs of the dragon)</p></blockquote><p>The scene\nwith the most ominous foreshadowing is Jon: He is thrown into the mud, when he\nis attacked by Orell\u2019s eagle. Jon\u2019s fall and death and loss of an eye (on this compare <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHV0A6XAqV1AbH1L0Bo2Bw\">@rose-of-red-lake</a>) are\nforeshadowed several times, and Ned\u2019s fall into the mud might be another hint\nto Jon\u2019s falling, which we see here:<br></p><p>The next he\nknew, he was <b>on his face</b> with the\ntaste of <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> in his\nmouth and Ygritte kneeling over him protectively, a bone dagger in her hand. He\ncould still hear wings, though the eagle was not in sight. Half his world was\nblack. \u201cMy eye,\u201d he said in sudden panic, raising a hand to his face.\n\u2026. \u201cThere\u2019s your hellcrow!\u201d Rattleshirt pointed at Jon.\n\u201cBleeding in the <b>mud</b> like a faithless dog!\u201d The eagle came\nflapping down to land atop the broken giant\u2019s skull that served him for his\nhelm. \u201cI\u2019m here for him.\u201d (ASOS, Jon II)</p><p>I would\nalert you to the fact that Duncan the Tall in the Hedge Knight also has a scene\nwith mud and blood \u2013 and he is temporarily blinded by blood in his eye.</p><blockquote><p>When his\neyes opened he was on the ground again, sprawled on his back. The <b>mud</b>\nhad all been knocked from his helm, but now one eye was closed by <b>blood</b>. Above was nothing but dark grey\nsky. (The Hedge Knight)</p></blockquote><p>A variant\nof this mud and blood connection is, when Khal Drogo is dying. He does not lie\nin the mud, but the mud plasters on his wound get mixed with blood. </p><blockquote><p>When they\nwere alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy surprising in\nsuch a big man, he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried <b>blue</b> <b>mud</b> from Drogo\u2019s chest. The\nplaster had caked hard as the <b>mud</b> walls of the Lamb Men, and like those\nwalls it cracked easily. Ser Jorah broke the dry <b>mud</b> with his knife,\npried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul,\nsweet smell rose from the wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were\ncrusted with <b>blood</b> and pus, Drogo\u2019s\nbreast black and glistening with corruption. (AGOT, Daenerys VIII)</p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis extremely interesting that the mud, that was used to cover his wounds is of\nblue colour, a Tully colour maybe? </p><p>\n\n5) Mud and death\n\n</p><p>But this is\nnot all there is to \u2018mud\u2019. We have seen sliding in the \u2018mud\u2019 is a real danger\nfor anyone fighting, but mud can be deadly in other ways as well:</p><p>During\ntheir travels Brienne and Podrick chance upon dangerous mud: </p><blockquote><p>\u201cStay off the mud, child,\u201d counseled Septon Meribald. \u201cThe\nmud is not fond of strangers. If you walk in the wrong place, it will open up\nand swallow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only <b>mud</b>,\u201d insisted Podrick. </p><p><b>\u201cUntil it fills your mouth and starts creeping up your nose. Then it\u2019s\ndeath.\u201d </b>He smiled to take the chill\noff his words. \u201cWipe off that mud and have a slice of orange, lad.\u201d\n(AFFC, Brienne V)</p></blockquote><p>And later:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf\nyou would sleep beneath a roof tonight, you must climb off your horses and\ncross the <b>mud</b> with me. The path of faith, we call it. Only the faithful\nmay cross safely. The wicked are swallowed by the quicksands, or drowned when\nthe tide comes rushing in. None of you are wicked, I hope? Even so, I would be\ncareful where I set my feet. Walk only where I walk, and you shall reach the\nother side.\u201d (AFFC, Brienne VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is\neven mud in connection with quicksands in one of Sansa\u2019s chapters, the only\ntime apart from her walking towards the rampart as if through ankle-deep mud,\nwhere mud has an appearance in her chapters and is not connected to Arya:</p><blockquote><p>Huge\nflowers bloomed in the <b>mud</b> and floated on pools of stagnant water, but\nif you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were\nquicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and\nlizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes\nand teeth. (AGOT, Sansa I)</p></blockquote><p>Ser Davos\nhas a near death experience after the Battle of the Blackwater and the mud\nproves dangerous in this case as well.</p><blockquote><p>Panic took\nhold of him. His hands flailed against the bottom of the river and sent up a\ncloud of <b>mud</b> that blinded him. His chest was growing tighter by the\ninstant. He clawed at the water, kicking, pushing himself, turning, his lungs\nscreaming for air, kicking, kicking, lost now in the river murk, kicking,\nkicking, kicking until he could kick no longer. When he opened his mouth to\nscream, the water came rushing in, tasting of salt, and Davos Seaworth knew\nthat he was drowning. (ASOS Davos I)</p></blockquote><p>The\nincident in F&amp;B, where an archmaester dies of slipping in the mud, might be\na hint as well: </p><blockquote><p>He proved\nmore robust than his predecessor, serving the realm until 12 AC, when he\nslipped in the mud, broke his hip, and died soon thereafter\u2026. (F&amp;B, Three\nheads had the dragon) <br></p></blockquote><p>I mean this might be coincidence, but GRRM could have\nsimply said: He took a fall?</p><p>So, what is\nit with dangerous mud? Is this a hint that Arya will become very deadly indeed? <br></p><p>There is yet another thing, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what to make of it:<br></p><p>6) Mud and (horse)shit\n\n</p><p>Another\ninteresting tidbit is this scene with Theon on Pyke</p><blockquote><p>Theon knelt. He had a\npurpose here, and might need Aeron\u2019s help to achieve it. A crown was worth a\nlittle <b>mud</b> and horseshit on his breeches, he supposed. (ACOK, Theon I)</p></blockquote><p>\u00a0- a very\nstrange wording and connection of mud and shit, but one that happens again, with\nJon of all people: </p><blockquote><p>Go on, I\u2019ll\nsee to your horse. If it\u2019s warm and dry inside, don\u2019t tell me, I wasn\u2019t asked\nin.\u201c He flicked a glob of wet <b>mud</b> out from under a horseshoe.\n\"Does this <b>mud</b> look like shit to you? Could it be that this whole\nhill is made of Craster\u2019s shit?\u201d (ACOK, Jon III).</p></blockquote><p>I would\nlike to link this to the following from Catelyn\u2019s chapters:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe distance between a lord and a grace is a small one, my\nlady,\u201d Catelyn said. \u201cLord Renly wears a crown, as does my son. If\nyou wish, we may stand here in the <b>mud</b> and debate what honors and titles\nare rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters\nto consider.\u201d (ACOK, Catelyn II)</p></blockquote><p>Is this a\nhint to the debate to come when the lords will discuss Jon\u2019s claim to the\ncrown? </p><p>So mud\nmight be even involved with the making of a king? This is admittedly very\ntinfoily\u2026.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud as a part of nature\n\n</p><p>Another\nvery prominent occurrence of mud is the connection of mud with Prince Quentyn,\nthe \u2018wrong suitor\u2019, the frog prince who was not saved by princess Dany but\nfailed in his bride quest. This is what Barristan has to say about Quentyn\nbeing mud :</p><blockquote><p>She wants\nfire, and Dorne sent her <b>mud</b>. </p><p>You could\nmake a poultice out of <b>mud</b> to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in <b>mud</b>\nand grow a crop to feed your children. <b>Mud</b> would nourish you, where fire\nwould only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose\nfire every time. (ADWD, the discarded knight)</p></blockquote><p>Here mud\nhas very positive connotations, something that connects mud to healing and\nfertility.</p><p>So, mud is\nmuch more dangerous than people allow for, but is also good. It\u2019s not just\nwater and earth, there is more to it and maybe even the connection of mud and\ndeath might have a positive aspect:</p><p>Firewights\nof Rh\u2019llor and the icewights of the Others are unnatural, and if it is indeed\nArya\u2019s fate to come to a deeper understanding of mercy, justice and revenge, then\nthe final death of Lady Stoneheart \u2013 which she probably will witness \u2013 brings\nthe natural order back. </p><p>I suggest that mud might point not only to Tullys, to danger and to\ndeath, but that it might also point towards a fall and a sudden change.</p><p>Arya is the\n\u2018wild card\u2019. Where her allegiance lies, will probably be crucial, and the\ndespised mud might become dangerous up to a point where the mud can suffocate and\nkill someone.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud and danger\n\n</p><p>Finally, I\nwould alert you to some ominous foreshadowing of mud and water besides the\nconnection to Khal Drogo\u2019s death I have discussed already.</p><p>Mud\nfeatures heavily in the tragic story of Da\u20acnerys, Drogo and Mirri Maaz Duur.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI\nmeant no wrong, fierce riders.\u201d The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes\nshe wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with\nembroidery, but now they were <b>mud</b>-caked and bloody and ripped. She\nclutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. \u201cI have some\nsmall skill in the healing arts.\u201d (AGOT, Daenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>Mirri is a healer, and it is interesting that her and her magic (we only see her practicing blood magic, but it stands to reason that her normal way of magic would be \u2018earth-bound\u2019).<br></p><blockquote><p>Khal Drogo\nwaved him away. \u201cI need no man\u2019s help,\u201d he said, in a voice proud and\nhard. He stood, unaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood ran down\nhis breast, from where Ogo\u2019s arakh had cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly\nto his side. \u201cI am no man,\u201d she whispered, \u201cso you may lean on\nme.\u201d Drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as\nthey walked toward the great <b>mud</b> temple. The three bloodriders followed.\nDany commanded Ser Jorah and the warriors of her khas to guard the entrance and\nmake certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside. (AGOT,\nDaenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>I would\nalert you to the fact, that Khal Drogo burns the <b>mud</b> temple of the Lamb people. So, MMD connected to mud via her\nreligion \u2013 which is a religion that seems to be heavily influenced by earth and\nnature worship\u00a0\n\u2013\n\n is an antagonist of Da\u20acnerys.</p><p>Considering\nthat Da\u20acnerys lives in a hot climate, the rare occurrence of mud may alert us to\nimportant crossroads of her arc.</p><blockquote><p>The\nprocession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled\nclothing fall to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri\nsaid the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft <b>mud</b> <b>squishing between her toes</b> as she pushed through the tall reeds.\nThe moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her\nripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness\ncrept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion\u2019s blood had dried\non her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the\nsacred waters over her head, cleansing herself and the child inside her while\nthe khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the dosh khaleen\nmuttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying. (AGOT,\nDa\u20acnerys V)</p></blockquote><p>This\nhappens after Da\u20acnerys ate the horse heart and awaits the dosh khaleen\u2019s\nprophecy on the future of her child, the \u201cstallion who mounts the world\u201d. This\nis when Viserys dies and she sets herself on the path towards winning the Iron\nThrone for herself.</p><p>In her last\nchapter in ADWD (Da\u20acnerys X) there is a recollection of the time she was\npregnant with Rhaego:</p><blockquote><p>It was\nquiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed\nagainst each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now\nand again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. <b>Mud</b>\n<b>squished between her toes</b>. Insects\nbuzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps and stinging\nmidges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they landed\non her arms.</p></blockquote><p>Her last\nchapter in ADWD is also important, because she really embraces her house words\n\u2018fire and blood\u2019, the last step in her transition from a frightened child to a\nruthless conqueror. This is also the chapter, where we see her possibly having\na miscarriage:</p><blockquote><p>Her belly\nwas empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping\nhad grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels.\nShe scooped up a handful of <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>\nin trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid, but in the chill of\ndawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she splashed her\nface, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic was\nstained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it\u2019s only\nmy moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. <b>Could it be the water? If it was the water,\nshe was doomed</b>. She had to drink or die of thirst. (ADWD Daenerys X)</p></blockquote><p>Very\ntentatively I would suggest that \u2018mud\u2019 and/ or water does not bode well for\nDa\u20acnerys. <b>If it was the water, she was\ndoomed.</b> Who has the strongest connection to the Riverlands? Who is a\nwaterdancer? Arya, the wild card, will be threat to Da\u20acnerys I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>To sum up:</p><p>Mud as a\ncombination of earth and water has a connection to the CotF and might be usable\nto balance the dangerous opposites of fire and ice.</p><p>Mud is a\ntell-tale Tully word. The red mud of the river is a sign for Tully, and it\nshows clearly that appearances put aside, Arya is the child that is most\nclosely connected to the Tully and the Riverlands and will probably witness the\nRed Wedding 2.0. and the final death of the unnaturally resurrected Lady\nStoneheart. Arya possibly will choose mud over fire.</p><p>Mud and\nblood are used repeatedly \u2013 and many more times when I put down here as\nexamples \u2013 to picture the dirtiness of fighting. Mud also has healing\nqualities, but can be dangerous as well (as every magic). We see this rarely,\nbut nevertheless in every book and in several PoVs.</p><p>There is a\nconnection between mud and death. Slipping in the mud can mean a sudden change\nto a fight and deadly danger. I would alert you to the fact that the healing\nqualities of mud only go awry when the healing women of the Dothraki fail to\nheal Khal Drogo.</p><p>Looking at\nDa\u20acnerys\u2019 arc I would say that mud does not bode well for her. Mud as a\nreminder of a more grounded life occurs at several crossroads in her arc,\nshortly before Viserys\u2019 death, with MMD, with the rejection of Quentyn\u2019s offer\nof marriage and the decision for her house words in her last chapter in ADWD. I\nthink it points towards the fact that the very personification of \u2018mud\u2019, Arya\nStark will cause a turn in Da\u20acnerys\u2019 story. I do think it is a further hint\nthat Arya will be the death of Da\u20acnerys. </p>",
                "content": "<p>In ASOIAF\nwe have two very obvious sources of magic: The Ice of the WW north of the Wall\nand the fire that is present in the dragons and Rh&rsquo;llors magic. Both magics\nseem to be very strong &ndash; both the WW and the servants of Rh&rsquo;llor can resurrect\nthe dead &ndash; producing ice wights or fire wights, respectively.</p><p>It has\npuzzled me for some time, that as regards to the traditional four elements\n&ldquo;earth, fire, air and water&rdquo;, the two opposites &ldquo;ice and fire&rdquo; do not exactly\nmatch. Fire obviously melts ice, but then ice becomes water that will\nextinguish the fire in turn. So, why ice and not water as an opposite to fire?</p><p>I put this under the cut because it became huge&hellip;</p><p>The show\ngave us a big hint as to the origins of the White Walkers. We saw the Children\nof the Forest make the first White Walker aka the Night King, and it seems\npretty clear, that the WW &ndash; at least in the show &ndash; are an experiment of the CotF\nthat has gone awry. The CotF woke ice magic and it developed an agenda of its\nown. It can be argued that the books might go in the same direction. There are\nhints that the Others are a problem the CotF created and that they finally\nallied with the First men to get rid of the threat &ndash; and did not succeed\nentirely. </p><p>So, ice\nmagic might be a variant of earth and water (or nature) magic, that has spiralled\nout of control. This instigated me to look at what we have in regard to earth\nmagic and water magic.</p><p>I do think\nthat from the description of the CotF in AWOIAF it is pretty clear, that the\nCotF do have an element of nature and earth magic.</p><blockquote><p>The gods\nthe children worshipped were the nameless ones that would one day become the\ngods of the First Men&mdash;the innumerable gods of <b>the streams and forests and stones</b>. (AWOIAF, The Dawn Age)</p></blockquote><p>And also in\nBran&rsquo;s PoV we have some hints to earth magic, most blatantly in the oath of\nJojen and Meera Reed, who as &lsquo;frog-eaters&rsquo; from the Neck have very close\nconnection to nature. In addition, their small stature probably makes them\nstand-ins for the CotF if not even descendants. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I swear it by <b>earth</b> and <b>water</b>,&rdquo; said the boy in green.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear it by bronze and iron,&rdquo;\nhis sister said. </p><p>&ldquo;We swear it by <b>ice</b> and <b>fire</b>,&rdquo; they finished together.</p><p> (ACOK, Bran III)</p></blockquote><p>This oath\nis surely a fogged memory about the first oath between CotF and the First men.\nEarth and Water is the magic of the CotF, bronze and iron are weapons (iron in\nlegends being specifically a weapon of men, not to be used by the faerie, elves\nor however you want to call them) and ice and fire is the common enemy. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nsaid Meera, &ldquo;but he could <b>breathe mud</b> and <b>run on leaves</b>, and change <b>earth</b>\nto <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> to <b>earth</b> with no\nmore than a whispered word. He could talk to trees and weave words and make\ncastles appear and disappear.&rdquo; (ASOS, Bran II)</p></blockquote><p>Here Meera\ntalks about her father, or rather about the legendary version of him. I would\nalert you to the fact, that earth and water are interchangeable and that there\nis an obvious stage of transmission as mud. </p><p>Also Bran&rsquo;s\nexperience while warging summer have a very earthy and magical vibe to them:</p><blockquote><p>The\nevening&rsquo;s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and\nstrong again. Grass and thorns, blackberries broken on the ground, mud, worms, rotting leaves, a rat\ncreeping through the bush. He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother&rsquo;s\ncoat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he&rsquo;d killed. Other\nsquirrels moved through the branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, their\nlittle claws scratching at the bark. The noise had sounded something like that.\n(ACOK, Bran VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is also the very real magical moment Jon experiences north of the\nwall, when he is at a place where the CotF might have influence. <br /></p><blockquote><p>The pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone. Every\nblade of grass was carved from emerald, every drip of water turned to diamond.\nFlowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass. <b>Even the mud puddles had\na bright brown sheen</b>. Through the shimmering greenery, the black tents of\nhis brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice. </p><p>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all. He found himself thinking of\nhis sisters, perhaps because he&rsquo;d dreamed of them last night. Sansa would call\nthis an enchantment, and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it, but\nArya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all. (ACOK, Jon\nIII)</p></blockquote><p>Now, this\nmade me wonder again, how earth and water come into play for the arcs of our\ncharacters in ASOIAF and that in turn led me to look at the Tullys and the word\n&ldquo;<b>mud</b>&rdquo; &ndash; the connection of earth and\nwater and I think I found some connections that might be worth pondering. </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> told\nme to be cautious about that, because, you know, mud happens if it rains, and\nit is no wonder that we see mud a lot in some of the PoVs, but still there are\nsome interesting observations to be made. So, my following deliberations are\nnot based on every mention of the word &lsquo;mud&rsquo;, because I would argue that sometimes\n&lsquo;mud&rsquo; is just &lsquo;mud&rsquo; and not a hint to the earth and water magic.</p><p>\n\n1) Tully mud\n\n</p><p>First of\nall, the observation that stuck out most to me is that mud is connected to the\nTullys and the Riverlands, explicitly and repeatedly. And it is a sort of\nreddish mud: red mud and blue water are the Tully colours.</p><blockquote><p>Catelyn raised her eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a\npath across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god.\n&ldquo;The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a <b>red</b> flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure\nthinks it&rsquo;s an omen of victory for Riverrun&mdash;he sees a fish with a long tail, in\nthe Tully colors, red against blue.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;I wish I had their\nfaith. Crimson is a Lannister color.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That thing&rsquo;s not crimson,&rdquo; Ser Brynden said. &ldquo;Nor Tully\nred, the <b>mud</b> <b>red</b> of the\nriver. That&rsquo;s <b>blood</b> up there, child,\nsmeared across the sky.&rdquo;(ACOK, Catelyn I)</p></blockquote><p>Repeatedly the\nTullys enter the stage all muddied: first of all Edmure Tully (ACOK, Catelyn VI,\nASOS, Catelyn I, and AFFC, Jaime VI), but also the Blackfish (ACOK, Catelyn I).\nCatelyn herself seems positively fond of mud. She fondly remembers baking &lsquo;mud\npies&rsquo; with Lysa and Petyr when they were children, and during her travels in\nAGOT she also gets muddy quite often &ndash; and seems to like it: </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is\nonly water, Ser Rodrik,&rdquo; Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a\nloose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild\nshe must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and\nwarm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother&rsquo;s kisses. It\ntook her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered\nthe godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her\nbrother&rsquo;s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She\nremembered making <b>mud</b> <b>pies</b>\nwith Lysa, the weight of them, the <b>mud</b> slick and brown between her\nfingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he&rsquo;d eaten so much\n<b>mud</b> he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. (AGOT, Catelyn\nV)</p></blockquote><p>The mud of\nthe river is also the graveyard of the Tullys, as we learn at the &lsquo;burial&rsquo; of\nHoster Tully. </p><blockquote><p>And then it\nwas gone &hellip; drifting downriver still, perhaps, or broken up and sinking. The\nweight of his armor would carry Lord Hoster down to rest in the soft <b>mud</b>\nof the riverbed, in the watery halls where the Tullys held eternal court, with\nschools of fish their last attendants. (ASOS, Catelyn IV)</p></blockquote><p>Catelyn\nherself is resurrected from the mud as Lady Stoneheart when Nymeria drags her\nout of the river (ASOS, Arya XII).</p><p>There is\neven a connection of mud and the Riverlands in F&amp;B: Harren the Black\ncomplains about&hellip; <br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;these traitors of the Trident, these lords of yellow mud.&rdquo; (F&amp;B,\nAegon&rsquo;s conquest).</p></blockquote><p>This should\nbe enough to establish that <b>mud</b> has\na strong <b>Tully connection </b>and therefore it is interesting to look at how mud is\ndepicted in the arcs of Catelyn&rsquo;s children. <br /></p><p>\n2) Sansa and Bran\n\n\n\n<br /></p><p>In Sansa&rsquo;s PoV mud occurs exactly only\nonce as it touches her, and it is no actual mud but just the feeling of not\nbeing able to walk: </p><blockquote><p>She forced\nherself to take King Joffrey&rsquo;s hand. The climb was something out of a\nnightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of <b>ankle-deep</b> <b>mud</b>, and there were\nmore steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror\nwaiting on the ramparts. (AGOT, Sansa VI)</p></blockquote><p>We have to\ncount out the Mud Gate in King&rsquo;s Landing. Now, of course Sansa stays mostly\nindoors, and in the Vale she is confronted with snow, not mud, but it is at\nleast worth noting, I think, that mud does not occur often in her POV, not in\nconnection to her anyway.</p><p>Bran&rsquo;s PoV\ndoesn&rsquo;t exactly overflow with mud connections either. One very interesting occurrence\nis when he plays with the Frey wards in ACOK. The Freys are the traitors and I would\nalert you to the fact that mud is connected to blood in this case.</p><blockquote><p>&hellip; until\nLittle Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across his belly.\nBefore Bran could blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was <b>blood</b> in the water, the Walders were\nshrieking <b>red</b> murder, Rickon sat in\nthe <b>mud</b> laughing, and Hodor came lumbering in shouting &ldquo;Hodor! Hodor!\nHodor!&rdquo; (ACOK, Bran I)</p></blockquote><p>So, neither Bran nor Sansa have a very strong Tully/water magic connection. That is completely different for<br /></p><p>3) Arya\n\n</p><p>There is no lack of mud, not at all. Interestingly it is in Sansa&rsquo;s Pov\nthat we see her connection to mud for the first time:</p><blockquote><p>She found\nArya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she\nbrushed dried <b>mud</b> from her fur. (AGOT, Sansa I) </p></blockquote><p>The\ndirewolves give hints about the personas of their owners, and it is extremely\ninteresting that we see Nymeria covered in mud through Sansa&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>And I think\nit is interesting that we see her happily playing in the mud, just like Catelyn\ndid:</p><blockquote><p>None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her\nhorsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in <b>mud</b>,\nclutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept\nhoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she\nwas supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for\nthe flowers. That just made her worse. </p><p>Then it turned out the purple\nflowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa would\nhave thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it,\nand the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman\njust because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching. (AGOT, Sansa\nI)</p></blockquote><p>Here we see\nconnection of mud and healing qualities &ndash; which might be a nod to the earth\nmagic.</p><p>I do think that\nArya&rsquo;s strong connection to mud has multiple purposes: It shows, that Arya, who\nlooks like Ned, also has a very strong connection to her mother, and actually\nis far more similar to her in temper than she is to Ned. Others have made this\nobservation before me: Arya looks like Ned, but is like Catelyn in temper,\nwhile Sansa looks like Catelyn, but has several traits of Ned. I do think that this\nfurther points towards the fact that Arya will meet Lady Stoneheart at one time\nin the book and will be present at the Red Wedding 2.0. (as she was in the\nshow).</p><p>Mud\nrepeatedly occurs to &lsquo;ground&rsquo; Arya when she is on the run. It gives a hint\nabout the people she can trust. When Yoren talks with Ned, and Arya sees him,\nthe man from the Watch who will take her away from King&rsquo;s Landing he wears <b>mud-cacked\nboots (</b>AGOT, Eddard VII).</p><p>Later when\nArya travels with Yoren, it is Hot Pie, part of her &lsquo;new&rsquo; family who is called\n&lsquo;mud pie&rsquo;:</p><blockquote><p>Lommy and\nTarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy <b>mud</b>\nand threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, &ldquo;<b>Mud</b> Pie! <b>Mud</b>\nPie!&rdquo; (ACOK, Arya IV).</p></blockquote><p>This is a\nclear connection to Catelyn baking mud pies with her sister.</p><p>In addition,\nArya feels positively good with water and mud:</p><blockquote><p>Despondent,\nshe climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake. The water lapped softly around\nher legs. A few lantern bugs were coming out, their little lights blinking on\nand off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in it. It\ntasted of summer and <b>mud</b> and growing things. Arya plunged her face down\ninto it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned\nback the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt\ngood. (ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>And later\nin the same chapter, crawling in the mud saves her life:</p><blockquote><p>Arya rolled\nheadfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but\nshe didn&rsquo;t care, the taste was fine, the taste was <b>mud</b> and water and\nworms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing\nbut blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses.\nShe moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to\ncrawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some\nmonstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up\nbehind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the <b>mud</b> on\nthe floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say. &nbsp;(ACOK, Arya IV)</p></blockquote><p>Later when\nshe has to walk barefoot she does not mind:</p><blockquote><p>The <b>mud</b>\nwas nice between her toes, and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she\nwalked. (ACOK, Arya V)</p></blockquote><p>Arya is\n- at least it looks like that - directly identified with mud, although the woman might be talking about\nLem here:</p><blockquote><p>The painted\nsign above the door showed a picture of some old king on his knees. Inside was\nthe common room, where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with her\nhands on her hips, glaring. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just stand there, boy,&rdquo; she\nsnapped. &ldquo;Or are you a girl? Either one, you&rsquo;re blocking my door. Get in\nor get out. Lem, what did I tell you about my floor? <b>You&rsquo;re all</b> <b>mud</b>.&rdquo; (ASOS, Arya II) </p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis interesting that Jaqen as one of the men who seemingly helps Arya has no\nconnection to mud. The magic of the faceless men seems to draw Arya away from\nher family. It is no earth/water magic.</p><p>There is only\none time, where Arya has a distinctively bad feeling about mud. It is a very\nominous dream of Arya, which is a foreshadowing of the Red Wedding and her\ninability to help her family. It is also a back reference to Sansa and her\ninability to help her father (who was already beheaded by the time she walked\nthrough &lsquo;<b>ankle-deep mud&rsquo;</b>, forced by Joffrey to look at her father&rsquo;s head).</p><blockquote><p>She dreamt\nof home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. It was not a good dream, though. She was\nalone outside the castle, <b>up to her\nknees in</b> <b>mud</b>. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when\nshe tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and\nthe castle faded before her, until it looked more like smoke than granite. (ASOS,\nArya III)</p></blockquote><p>Just like\nSansa couldn&rsquo;t help her father, Arya can&rsquo;t help her mother and Robb.</p><p>This all cumulates\nin the almost reunion at the Red Wedding where mud occurs very\nfrequently in Arya&rsquo;s PoV. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come\nwith me.&rdquo; Sandor Clegane reached down a hand. &ldquo;We have to get away\nfrom here, and now.&rdquo; Stranger tossed his head impatiently, his nostrils\nflaring at the scent of blood. The song was done. There was only one solitary\ndrum, its slow monotonous beats echoing across the river like the pounding of\nsome monstrous heart. The black sky wept, the river grumbled, men cursed and\ndied. Arya had <b>mud</b> in her teeth and her face was wet. Rain. It&rsquo;s only\nrain. That&rsquo;s all it is. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she shouted. Her voice sounded\nthin and scared, a little girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Robb&rsquo;s just in the castle, and my\nmother. The gate&rsquo;s even open.&rdquo; There were no more Freys riding out. I came\nso far. &ldquo;We have to go get my mother.&rdquo; (ASOS, Arya IX)</p></blockquote><p>The most\nheartbreaking connection of mud to Arya&rsquo;s family and in particular her mother\nis still to come though: Nymeria drags Catelyn&rsquo;s corpse from the mud of the\nriver (remember the burial place of the Tullys) but she cannot help Catelyn,\nwho is dead.</p><blockquote><p>&hellip; and\nthen she could smell her. The scent was faint beneath the other smells, beneath\nmoss and <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>, and\nthe stench of rotting reeds and rotting men. She padded slowly through the soft\nground to the river&rsquo;s edge, lapped up a drink, the lifted her head to sniff.\nThe sky was grey and thick with cloud, the river green and full of floating\nthings. Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water pushed\nthem, others washed up on the banks. &hellip;.</p><p>She\nsplashed noisily through the shallows and threw herself into the deeper water,\nher legs churning. The current was strong but she was stronger. She swam,\nfollowing her nose. The river smells were rich and wet, but those were not the\nsmells that pulled her. She paddled after the sharp <b>red</b> whisper of cold blood, the sweet cloying stench of death. She\nchased them as she had often chased a <b>red</b>\ndeer through the trees, and in the end she ran them down, and her jaw closed\naround a pale white arm. She shook it to make it move, but there was only death\nand blood in her mouth. By now she was tiring, and it was all she could do to\npull the body back to shore. As she dragged it up the <b>muddy</b> bank, one of her little brothers came prowling, his tongue\nlolling from his mouth. She had to snarl to drive him off, or else he would\nhave fed. Only then did she stop to shake the water from her fur. The white\nthing lay <b>facedown</b> in the <b>mud</b>,\nher dead flesh wrinkled and pale, cold blood trickling from her throat. Rise,\nshe thought. Rise and eat and run with us. (ASOS, Arya XII)</p></blockquote><p>I do think\nthat the colour <b>red </b>probably is put here to make a connection to the <b>red </b>of the\n<b>Tully </b>mud, and of course the blood that was spilt when Catelyn was killed.</p><p>It is\ninteresting, that as soon as Arya is in Braavos, the occurrence of mud decreases,\nbecause she disconnects with her family. It is also a strong hint, that the\nFaceless men will not be Arya&rsquo;s family, that she&rsquo;ll ultimately reject being\npart of them (like she did on the show). It is only in Arya&rsquo;s dreams, that mud\noccurs:</p><blockquote><p>It was the\nother dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four. In that\none she was always looking for her mother, stumbling through a wasted land of <b>mud</b>\nand blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear her\nmother screaming, but a monster with a dog&rsquo;s head would not let her go save\nher. In that dream she was always weeping, like a frightened little girl. Cats\nnever weep, she told herself, no more than wolves do. It&rsquo;s just a stupid dream.\n(AFFC, Cat of the Canals)</p></blockquote><p>Clearly,\nthis dream is induced by Arya&rsquo;s trauma. </p><p>So, mud,\nthe combination of earth and water clearly occurs to &lsquo;ground&rsquo; Arya, to give her\na connection to her mother&rsquo;s family, which will come into play again, once she\nreturns to Westeros. But the Tully connection, earth/water magic connection is not the only thing that stands out about mud.<br /></p><p>\n\n4) Mud and Blood\n\n</p><p>Another interesting\nfind in connection with mud is that there are multiple times that mud and blood\nare connected. In a way, this occurs naturally, the gritty realism of the\nfighting in GRRM&rsquo;s world is pictured by &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; fights and therefore mud often\noccurs in fights, e.g at the tourney in King&rsquo;s Landing (AGOT, Eddard VII), or\nRobert&rsquo;s death (AGOT, Eddard XIII). Also, this fight of Brienne and Jaime might\nbe put here:</p><blockquote><p>Brienne\nlurched to her feet. She was all <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> below the waist, her clothing askew, her face red. She looks\nas if they caught us fucking instead of fighting. (ASOS, Jaime III)</p></blockquote><p>As well as\nthis fight from Asha&rsquo;s PoV</p><blockquote><p>When he fell, Hagen&rsquo;s daughter stumbled to her knees, snatched up his sword,\nstabbed the second man, then rose again, smeared with <b>blood</b> and <b>mud</b>, her long red hair unbound, and plunged into\nthe fight. (ADWD, The Wayward bride)</p></blockquote><p>So, these\nare just two examples where the mud adds to the &lsquo;dirtyness&rsquo; of fighting, there\nare many more.</p><p>\n\n5) Mud and slipping/falling\n\n</p><p>A very\nspecial case of mud and fighting is when a fight ends with someone lying in the\nmud. Over the course of ASOIAF several people come to lay in the mud, wounded,\nhurt or near to death, and I think this might be way to alert us to a\nconnection of mud and death.</p><p>The very\nfirst time is in the prologue &ndash; which is also a foreshadowing of Jon&rsquo;s death as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a> has shown:</p><blockquote><p>The great sentinel was right\nthere at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest\nbranches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly\nin the snow and the <b>mud</b>, and looked down on the empty clearing below. (AGOT,\nPrologue)</p></blockquote><p>When Ned\nand Jaime fight, Ned falls from his horse and lies in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Ned&rsquo;s horse\nslipped under him and came crashing down in the <b>mud</b>. There was a moment\nof blinding pain and the taste of <b>blood</b>\nin his mouth. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When he\nopened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. His horse\nmoved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to\ndrag himself through the <b>mud</b>, gritting his teeth at the agony in his\nleg. It seemed to take years. (AGOT, Eddard IX)</p></blockquote><p>Tyrion also\nhas a <b>muddy</b> experience in his first\nbattle:</p><blockquote><p>Tyrion\nlurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse&rsquo;s belly. The animal gave a\nhideous scream and reared. It tried to twist away from the agony, a shower of <b>blood</b> and viscera poured down over\nTyrion&rsquo;s face, and the horse fell like an avalanche. The next he knew, his\nvisor was packed with <b>mud</b> and something was crushing his foot. He\nwriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk. &ldquo;&hellip; yield &hellip;&rdquo;\nhe managed to croak faintly. (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)) </p></blockquote><p>Several\npeople land on their arses in the mud, which is not necessarily connected to dying.\nArya does when she travels with the hound (ASOS, Arya XI), Podrick Payne falls\nin the mud, when Brienne catches him spying on her (AFFC, Brienne II) and Jaime\nkisses the muddy ground in his training exercise with Ser Ilyn (AFFC, Jaime V).</p><p>Yet, coming\nto fall in the mud, might be considered a bad omen, or at least a sign of sudden change. I think that <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> connected are not only there to convey a &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; fight, but\nalso to foreshadow bad things to come. It is no happenstance that Ned falls\ninto the mud when he is confronted by Jaime Lannister in the streets of King&rsquo;s\nLanding.</p><p>It is\ninteresting that we see Ser Criston Cole, the commander of the King&rsquo;s Guard,\nand in part a Jaime stand-in, actually killing a man in the mud:</p><blockquote><p>Cole&rsquo;s\nfavorite weapon was the Morningstar, and the blows he rained done on Ser\nLaenor&rsquo;s champion cracked his helm and left him senseless in the mud. Borne\nbloody from the field, Ser Joffrey died without recovering consciousness six\ndays later. (F&amp;B, Heirs of the dragon)</p></blockquote><p>The scene\nwith the most ominous foreshadowing is Jon: He is thrown into the mud, when he\nis attacked by Orell&rsquo;s eagle. Jon&rsquo;s fall and death and loss of an eye (on this compare <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrHV0A6XAqV1AbH1L0Bo2Bw\">@rose-of-red-lake</a>) are\nforeshadowed several times, and Ned&rsquo;s fall into the mud might be another hint\nto Jon&rsquo;s falling, which we see here:<br /></p><p>The next he\nknew, he was <b>on his face</b> with the\ntaste of <b>mud</b> and <b>blood</b> in his\nmouth and Ygritte kneeling over him protectively, a bone dagger in her hand. He\ncould still hear wings, though the eagle was not in sight. Half his world was\nblack. &ldquo;My eye,&rdquo; he said in sudden panic, raising a hand to his face.\n&hellip;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your hellcrow!&rdquo; Rattleshirt pointed at Jon.\n&ldquo;Bleeding in the <b>mud</b> like a faithless dog!&rdquo; The eagle came\nflapping down to land atop the broken giant&rsquo;s skull that served him for his\nhelm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for him.&rdquo; (ASOS, Jon II)</p><p>I would\nalert you to the fact that Duncan the Tall in the Hedge Knight also has a scene\nwith mud and blood &ndash; and he is temporarily blinded by blood in his eye.</p><blockquote><p>When his\neyes opened he was on the ground again, sprawled on his back. The <b>mud</b>\nhad all been knocked from his helm, but now one eye was closed by <b>blood</b>. Above was nothing but dark grey\nsky. (The Hedge Knight)</p></blockquote><p>A variant\nof this mud and blood connection is, when Khal Drogo is dying. He does not lie\nin the mud, but the mud plasters on his wound get mixed with blood. </p><blockquote><p>When they\nwere alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy surprising in\nsuch a big man, he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried <b>blue</b> <b>mud</b> from Drogo&rsquo;s chest. The\nplaster had caked hard as the <b>mud</b> walls of the Lamb Men, and like those\nwalls it cracked easily. Ser Jorah broke the dry <b>mud</b> with his knife,\npried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul,\nsweet smell rose from the wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were\ncrusted with <b>blood</b> and pus, Drogo&rsquo;s\nbreast black and glistening with corruption. (AGOT, Daenerys VIII)</p></blockquote><p>I think it\nis extremely interesting that the mud, that was used to cover his wounds is of\nblue colour, a Tully colour maybe? </p><p>\n\n5) Mud and death\n\n</p><p>But this is\nnot all there is to &lsquo;mud&rsquo;. We have seen sliding in the &lsquo;mud&rsquo; is a real danger\nfor anyone fighting, but mud can be deadly in other ways as well:</p><p>During\ntheir travels Brienne and Podrick chance upon dangerous mud: </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stay off the mud, child,&rdquo; counseled Septon Meribald. &ldquo;The\nmud is not fond of strangers. If you walk in the wrong place, it will open up\nand swallow you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only <b>mud</b>,&rdquo; insisted Podrick. </p><p><b>&ldquo;Until it fills your mouth and starts creeping up your nose. Then it&rsquo;s\ndeath.&rdquo; </b>He smiled to take the chill\noff his words. &ldquo;Wipe off that mud and have a slice of orange, lad.&rdquo;\n(AFFC, Brienne V)</p></blockquote><p>And later:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If\nyou would sleep beneath a roof tonight, you must climb off your horses and\ncross the <b>mud</b> with me. The path of faith, we call it. Only the faithful\nmay cross safely. The wicked are swallowed by the quicksands, or drowned when\nthe tide comes rushing in. None of you are wicked, I hope? Even so, I would be\ncareful where I set my feet. Walk only where I walk, and you shall reach the\nother side.&rdquo; (AFFC, Brienne VI)</p></blockquote><p>There is\neven mud in connection with quicksands in one of Sansa&rsquo;s chapters, the only\ntime apart from her walking towards the rampart as if through ankle-deep mud,\nwhere mud has an appearance in her chapters and is not connected to Arya:</p><blockquote><p>Huge\nflowers bloomed in the <b>mud</b> and floated on pools of stagnant water, but\nif you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were\nquicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and\nlizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes\nand teeth. (AGOT, Sansa I)</p></blockquote><p>Ser Davos\nhas a near death experience after the Battle of the Blackwater and the mud\nproves dangerous in this case as well.</p><blockquote><p>Panic took\nhold of him. His hands flailed against the bottom of the river and sent up a\ncloud of <b>mud</b> that blinded him. His chest was growing tighter by the\ninstant. He clawed at the water, kicking, pushing himself, turning, his lungs\nscreaming for air, kicking, kicking, lost now in the river murk, kicking,\nkicking, kicking until he could kick no longer. When he opened his mouth to\nscream, the water came rushing in, tasting of salt, and Davos Seaworth knew\nthat he was drowning. (ASOS Davos I)</p></blockquote><p>The\nincident in F&amp;B, where an archmaester dies of slipping in the mud, might be\na hint as well: </p><blockquote><p>He proved\nmore robust than his predecessor, serving the realm until 12 AC, when he\nslipped in the mud, broke his hip, and died soon thereafter&hellip;. (F&amp;B, Three\nheads had the dragon) <br /></p></blockquote><p>I mean this might be coincidence, but GRRM could have\nsimply said: He took a fall?</p><p>So, what is\nit with dangerous mud? Is this a hint that Arya will become very deadly indeed? <br /></p><p>There is yet another thing, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what to make of it:<br /></p><p>6) Mud and (horse)shit\n\n</p><p>Another\ninteresting tidbit is this scene with Theon on Pyke</p><blockquote><p>Theon knelt. He had a\npurpose here, and might need Aeron&rsquo;s help to achieve it. A crown was worth a\nlittle <b>mud</b> and horseshit on his breeches, he supposed. (ACOK, Theon I)</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;- a very\nstrange wording and connection of mud and shit, but one that happens again, with\nJon of all people: </p><blockquote><p>Go on, I&rsquo;ll\nsee to your horse. If it&rsquo;s warm and dry inside, don&rsquo;t tell me, I wasn&rsquo;t asked\nin.&ldquo; He flicked a glob of wet <b>mud</b> out from under a horseshoe.\n\"Does this <b>mud</b> look like shit to you? Could it be that this whole\nhill is made of Craster&rsquo;s shit?&rdquo; (ACOK, Jon III).</p></blockquote><p>I would\nlike to link this to the following from Catelyn&rsquo;s chapters:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The distance between a lord and a grace is a small one, my\nlady,&rdquo; Catelyn said. &ldquo;Lord Renly wears a crown, as does my son. If\nyou wish, we may stand here in the <b>mud</b> and debate what honors and titles\nare rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters\nto consider.&rdquo; (ACOK, Catelyn II)</p></blockquote><p>Is this a\nhint to the debate to come when the lords will discuss Jon&rsquo;s claim to the\ncrown? </p><p>So mud\nmight be even involved with the making of a king? This is admittedly very\ntinfoily&hellip;.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud as a part of nature\n\n</p><p>Another\nvery prominent occurrence of mud is the connection of mud with Prince Quentyn,\nthe &lsquo;wrong suitor&rsquo;, the frog prince who was not saved by princess Dany but\nfailed in his bride quest. This is what Barristan has to say about Quentyn\nbeing mud :</p><blockquote><p>She wants\nfire, and Dorne sent her <b>mud</b>. </p><p>You could\nmake a poultice out of <b>mud</b> to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in <b>mud</b>\nand grow a crop to feed your children. <b>Mud</b> would nourish you, where fire\nwould only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose\nfire every time. (ADWD, the discarded knight)</p></blockquote><p>Here mud\nhas very positive connotations, something that connects mud to healing and\nfertility.</p><p>So, mud is\nmuch more dangerous than people allow for, but is also good. It&rsquo;s not just\nwater and earth, there is more to it and maybe even the connection of mud and\ndeath might have a positive aspect:</p><p>Firewights\nof Rh&rsquo;llor and the icewights of the Others are unnatural, and if it is indeed\nArya&rsquo;s fate to come to a deeper understanding of mercy, justice and revenge, then\nthe final death of Lady Stoneheart &ndash; which she probably will witness &ndash; brings\nthe natural order back. </p><p>I suggest that mud might point not only to Tullys, to danger and to\ndeath, but that it might also point towards a fall and a sudden change.</p><p>Arya is the\n&lsquo;wild card&rsquo;. Where her allegiance lies, will probably be crucial, and the\ndespised mud might become dangerous up to a point where the mud can suffocate and\nkill someone.</p><p>\n\n7) Mud and danger\n\n</p><p>Finally, I\nwould alert you to some ominous foreshadowing of mud and water besides the\nconnection to Khal Drogo&rsquo;s death I have discussed already.</p><p>Mud\nfeatures heavily in the tragic story of Da&euro;nerys, Drogo and Mirri Maaz Duur.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I\nmeant no wrong, fierce riders.&rdquo; The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes\nshe wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with\nembroidery, but now they were <b>mud</b>-caked and bloody and ripped. She\nclutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. &ldquo;I have some\nsmall skill in the healing arts.&rdquo; (AGOT, Daenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>Mirri is a healer, and it is interesting that her and her magic (we only see her practicing blood magic, but it stands to reason that her normal way of magic would be &lsquo;earth-bound&rsquo;).<br /></p><blockquote><p>Khal Drogo\nwaved him away. &ldquo;I need no man&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; he said, in a voice proud and\nhard. He stood, unaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood ran down\nhis breast, from where Ogo&rsquo;s arakh had cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly\nto his side. &ldquo;I am no man,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;so you may lean on\nme.&rdquo; Drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as\nthey walked toward the great <b>mud</b> temple. The three bloodriders followed.\nDany commanded Ser Jorah and the warriors of her khas to guard the entrance and\nmake certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside. (AGOT,\nDaenerys VII)</p></blockquote><p>I would\nalert you to the fact, that Khal Drogo burns the <b>mud</b> temple of the Lamb people. So, MMD connected to mud via her\nreligion &ndash; which is a religion that seems to be heavily influenced by earth and\nnature worship&nbsp;\n&ndash;\n\n is an antagonist of Da&euro;nerys.</p><p>Considering\nthat Da&euro;nerys lives in a hot climate, the rare occurrence of mud may alert us to\nimportant crossroads of her arc.</p><blockquote><p>The\nprocession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled\nclothing fall to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri\nsaid the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft <b>mud</b> <b>squishing between her toes</b> as she pushed through the tall reeds.\nThe moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her\nripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness\ncrept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion&rsquo;s blood had dried\non her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the\nsacred waters over her head, cleansing herself and the child inside her while\nthe khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the dosh khaleen\nmuttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying. (AGOT,\nDa&euro;nerys V)</p></blockquote><p>This\nhappens after Da&euro;nerys ate the horse heart and awaits the dosh khaleen&rsquo;s\nprophecy on the future of her child, the &ldquo;stallion who mounts the world&rdquo;. This\nis when Viserys dies and she sets herself on the path towards winning the Iron\nThrone for herself.</p><p>In her last\nchapter in ADWD (Da&euro;nerys X) there is a recollection of the time she was\npregnant with Rhaego:</p><blockquote><p>It was\nquiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed\nagainst each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now\nand again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. <b>Mud</b>\n<b>squished between her toes</b>. Insects\nbuzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps and stinging\nmidges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they landed\non her arms.</p></blockquote><p>Her last\nchapter in ADWD is also important, because she really embraces her house words\n&lsquo;fire and blood&rsquo;, the last step in her transition from a frightened child to a\nruthless conqueror. This is also the chapter, where we see her possibly having\na miscarriage:</p><blockquote><p>Her belly\nwas empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping\nhad grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels.\nShe scooped up a handful of <b>mud</b> and <b>water</b>\nin trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid, but in the chill of\ndawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she splashed her\nface, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic was\nstained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it&rsquo;s only\nmy moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. <b>Could it be the water? If it was the water,\nshe was doomed</b>. She had to drink or die of thirst. (ADWD Daenerys X)</p></blockquote><p>Very\ntentatively I would suggest that &lsquo;mud&rsquo; and/ or water does not bode well for\nDa&euro;nerys. <b>If it was the water, she was\ndoomed.</b> Who has the strongest connection to the Riverlands? Who is a\nwaterdancer? Arya, the wild card, will be threat to Da&euro;nerys I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p><p>To sum up:</p><p>Mud as a\ncombination of earth and water has a connection to the CotF and might be usable\nto balance the dangerous opposites of fire and ice.</p><p>Mud is a\ntell-tale Tully word. The red mud of the river is a sign for Tully, and it\nshows clearly that appearances put aside, Arya is the child that is most\nclosely connected to the Tully and the Riverlands and will probably witness the\nRed Wedding 2.0. and the final death of the unnaturally resurrected Lady\nStoneheart. Arya possibly will choose mud over fire.</p><p>Mud and\nblood are used repeatedly &ndash; and many more times when I put down here as\nexamples &ndash; to picture the dirtiness of fighting. Mud also has healing\nqualities, but can be dangerous as well (as every magic). We see this rarely,\nbut nevertheless in every book and in several PoVs.</p><p>There is a\nconnection between mud and death. Slipping in the mud can mean a sudden change\nto a fight and deadly danger. I would alert you to the fact that the healing\nqualities of mud only go awry when the healing women of the Dothraki fail to\nheal Khal Drogo.</p><p>Looking at\nDa&euro;nerys&rsquo; arc I would say that mud does not bode well for her. Mud as a\nreminder of a more grounded life occurs at several crossroads in her arc,\nshortly before Viserys&rsquo; death, with MMD, with the rejection of Quentyn&rsquo;s offer\nof marriage and the decision for her house words in her last chapter in ADWD. I\nthink it points towards the fact that the very personification of &lsquo;mud&rsquo;, Arya\nStark will cause a turn in Da&euro;nerys&rsquo; story. I do think it is a further hint\nthat Arya will be the death of Da&euro;nerys. </p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>In ASOIAF\nwe have two very obvious sources of magic: The Ice of the WW north of the Wall\nand the fire that is present in the dragons and Rh&rsquo;llors magic.

It reminded me of the wolves invading the lands\nnorth of King\u2019s Landing at the start of ACOK. It reminded me of Ghost, and how\nhe was the only beast unafraid of the still moving, undead hand. It was in this\nchapter that Leaf told Bran of the death of unicorns, giants, and other magical\nforces who once lived North of the Wall. I thought of the giants who supposedly\nhelped build the Wall. </p><p>And it just hit me: that the Others probably rose\nagain because Nature\u2019s natural \u201cweapons\u201d against them \u2013 giants and direwolves\nand children of the forest \u2013 were dying out. That the War against the Others\nwas never a war meant for men to fight. Bran, Jojen and Meera did nothing while\nSummer led his pack in a wights hunt. We learned that there was another way,\napart from fire and dragonglass, to kill wights: you could eat them. </p><p>Maybe there\u2019s a reason, apart from the war of the five\nkings, why wolves are invading the lands. Maybe it\u2019s nature, preparing itself\nfor the oncoming of the dead. </p><p>(Maybe Jon will slip into Ghost\u2019s skin to kill the\nNight King?

The moon \u201cfat and full\u201d\nis a clear reference to pregnancy and life, whereas the \u201ccrescent, thin and\nsharp as the blade of a knife\u201d means death. The chapter concludes with a set of\nthree visions, the first of a pregnant woman emerging from a \u201cblack pool\u201d, the\nlast of a woman with white hairs (old, I presume) slicing a boy\u2019s throat as an\noffering to the weirwood:</p><p><i>Then, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees\nbefore the heart tree.

And through the mist of centuries the broken boy could\nonly watch as the man&rsquo;s feet drummed against the earth \u2026 but as his life flowed\nout of him in a red tide, Brandon Stark could taste the blood.</i> \u2013 Bran, ADWD</p><p>I searched \u201csickle\u201d on Google image and this is what I\ngot:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"195\" data-orig-height=\"157\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/330beea89b6a20b66f2887836b689e13/tumblr_inline_pmgstpdgKJ1vdv8tx_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"195\" data-orig-height=\"157\"/></figure><p>Basically, it\u2019s a crescent moon shaped knife. In\nfarming, it is (or was) used to harvest wheat and corn stalks. It\u2019s both a\nreference to death (as it\u2019s used to kill) and life (as it\u2019s used to collect\nfood). \u00a0The sickle is actually very similar\nto the <i>arakh</i>, a signature dothraki weapon:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"387\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3839df81580ef2af11122def5b769e65/tumblr_inline_pmgsuobBLq1vdv8tx_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"387\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure><p>(You\u2019d knew I\u2019d find a way to bring Daenerys into\nthis, didn\u2019t you?)</p><p>But I had to, because you just can\u2019t talk about\npregnancy in asoiaf without mentioning the primary character associated with\nmotherhood, pregnancy, sacrifice and the moon. From this Bran chapter, one\nthing that seems connected to fertility is the rich, dampness and warmth of the\nearth. Daenerys, who believes herself to be barren, rule over a dry, barren\nland in Meereen. Droughts, deserts, dryness\u2026 she encounters it all. </p><p><i>They rode to <b>the lake the\nDothraki called the Womb of the World</b>, surrounded by a <b>fringe of reeds</b>, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand\nyears ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its depths, riding\nupon the back of the first horse.</i></p><p><i> The procession waited on the\ngrassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to the ground.\nNaked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom,\nbut Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the\ntall reeds. <b>The moon floated on the\nstill black waters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over it.</b></i><b> </b>\u2013 Daenerys, AGOT</p><p>The \u201cfringe of reeds\u201d part is interesting, since Bran is\nalso surrounded by \u201creeds\u201d (Jojen and Meera) when inside the \u201cwomb\u201d of the\ncave, in ADWD. Anyway, Daenerys bathing in the black waters (bathing <i>with </i>the moon, I might add, just like\nshe\u2019s bathing with the child inside her belly) is definitely a parallel to the \u201c<b><i>a\nwoman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt\nbefore the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her</i></b>\u201d\npart. Odder, even, is that her child will be sacrificed, like the man sacrificed\nto the weirwood in Bran\u2019s vision. </p><p>The black waters are present in Bran\u2019s cave as well:</p><p><i>&ldquo;The river you hear is swift and black, and flows down and down to\na sunless sea.\u201d</i> \u2013 Bran, ADWD</p><p>Bran \u201cemerges\u201d from it every time he warg a raven, or\nSummer, and leaves the cave. Once, he goes into the literal black waters, and\nback up, while warged into Hodor:</p><p><i>One day Meera and Jojen decided to go see the river, despite Leaf&rsquo;s\ncautions. &quot;I want to come too,&rdquo; Bran said.</i></p><p><i> Meera gave him a mournful look.\nThe river was six hundred feet below, down steep slopes and twisty passages,\nshe explained, and the last part required climbing down a rope. &ldquo;Hodor\ncould never make the climb with you on his back. I&rsquo;m sorry, Bran.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> Bran remembered a time when no\none could climb as good as him, not even Robb or Jon. Part of him wanted to\nshout at them for leaving him, and another part wanted to cry. He was almost a\nman grown, though, so he said nothing. But after they were gone, he slipped\ninside Hodor&rsquo;s skin and followed them.</i> \u2013 Bran, ADWD</p><p>I <i>think </i>the\nblack waters are linked with the black moon and overall symbolize a phase of \u201cincubation\u201d.\nThe crescent shaped moon, I\u2019d link it with blood magic, magical sight (for\nBran) and for Daenerys, something related to the dothraki, as well as to the \u201creaping\nand harvesting\u201d stage. You could probably view her recruitment of the dothraki in\nseason six as a form of \u201charvest\u201d. Dany\u2019s army/armies and Bran\u2019s magical sight\nboth come at the price of blood, during the \u201ccrescent moon phase\u201d of their\njourneys. That\u2019s where ADWD leaves them: Bran\u2019s last \u201cmoon\u201d is a crescent\nshaped one, his chapter ending with him lost in a vision and tasting the blood of\nthe man dying at \u201chis\u201d weirwood\u2019s feet. \u00a0Dany\u2019s\nlast chapter ends with her being surrounded by dothraki warriors in the Great\nGrass Sea. </p><p>I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve reached the full moon phase yet.\nThe moon \u201cfat and full\u201d will come last for them.\u00a0</p><p>P.S as usual, pic link in the comments below.</p>",

From this Bran chapter, one\nthing that seems connected to fertility is the rich, dampness and warmth of the\nearth. Daenerys, who believes herself to be barren, rule over a dry, barren\nland in Meereen. Droughts, deserts, dryness\u2026 she encounters it all. </p><p><i>They rode to <b>the lake the\nDothraki called the Womb of the World</b>, surrounded by a <b>fringe of reeds</b>, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand\nyears ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its depths, riding\nupon the back of the first horse.</i></p><p><i> The procession waited on the\ngrassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to the ground.\nNaked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom,\nbut Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the\ntall reeds. <b>The moon floated on the\nstill black waters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over it.</b></i><b> </b>\u2013 Daenerys, AGOT</p><p>The \u201cfringe of reeds\u201d part is interesting, since Bran is\nalso surrounded by \u201creeds\u201d (Jojen and Meera) when inside the \u201cwomb\u201d of the\ncave, in ADWD. Anyway, Daenerys bathing in the black waters (bathing <i>with </i>the moon, I might add, just like\nshe\u2019s bathing with the child inside her belly) is definitely a parallel to the \u201c<b><i>a\nwoman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt\nbefore the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her</i></b>\u201d\npart. Odder, even, is that her child will be sacrificed, like the man sacrificed\nto the weirwood in Bran\u2019s vision. </p><p>The black waters are present in Bran\u2019s cave as well:</p><p><i>\u201cThe river you hear is swift and black, and flows down and down to\na sunless sea.\u201d</i> \u2013 Bran, ADWD</p><p>Bran \u201cemerges\u201d from it every time he warg a raven, or\nSummer, and leaves the cave. Once, he goes into the literal black waters, and\nback up, while warged into Hodor:</p><p><i>One day Meera and Jojen decided to go see the river, despite Leaf\u2019s\ncautions. \"I want to come too,\u201d Bran said.</i></p><p><i> Meera gave him a mournful look.\nThe river was six hundred feet below, down steep slopes and twisty passages,\nshe explained, and the last part required climbing down a rope. \u201cHodor\ncould never make the climb with you on his back. I\u2019m sorry, Bran.\u201d</i></p><p><i> Bran remembered a time when no\none could climb as good as him, not even Robb or Jon. Part of him wanted to\nshout at them for leaving him, and another part wanted to cry. He was almost a\nman grown, though, so he said nothing. But after they were gone, he slipped\ninside Hodor\u2019s skin and followed them.</i> \u2013 Bran, ADWD</p><p>I <i>think </i>the\nblack waters are linked with the black moon and overall symbolize a phase of \u201cincubation\u201d.\nThe crescent shaped moon, I\u2019d link it with blood magic, magical sight (for\nBran) and for Daenerys, something related to the dothraki, as well as to the \u201creaping\nand harvesting\u201d stage. You could probably view her recruitment of the dothraki in\nseason six as a form of \u201charvest\u201d. Dany\u2019s army/armies and Bran\u2019s magical sight\nboth come at the price of blood, during the \u201ccrescent moon phase\u201d of their\njourneys. That\u2019s where ADWD leaves them: Bran\u2019s last \u201cmoon\u201d is a crescent\nshaped one, his chapter ending with him lost in a vision and tasting the blood of\nthe man dying at \u201chis\u201d weirwood\u2019s feet. \u00a0Dany\u2019s\nlast chapter ends with her being surrounded by dothraki warriors in the Great\nGrass Sea. </p><p>I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve reached the full moon phase yet.\nThe moon \u201cfat and full\u201d will come last for them.\u00a0</p><p>P.S as usual, pic link in the comments below.</p>",

Bloodraven\u2019s description also\nevoke a fetus in the womb: \u201c<i>Lord Brynden\ndrew his life from the tree, Leaf told them.

Darkness will be\nyour cloak, your shield, <b>your mother\u2019s\nmilk.</b> Darkness will make you strong.\u201d</i></p><p><i>In the beginning he had tried to count the days by making note of when\nhe woke and slept, but <b>down here\nsleeping and waking had a way of melting into one another.</b></i></p><p><i>He even crossed the slender stone bridge that arched over the abyss and\ndiscovered more passages and chambers on the far side. <b>One was full of singers, enthroned like Brynden in nests of weirwood\nroots that wove under and through and around</b> their bodies.</i></p><p><i>He wanted to put his arms around her, hold her tight <b>the way his mother used to hold him</b>\nback at Winterfell when he\u2019d hurt himself.</i></p><p><i>His father and the black pool and the godswood faded and were gone and\nhe was back in the cavern, <b>the pale\nthick roots of his weirwood throne cradling his limbs as a mother does a child.</b></i></p><p><i>\u2026a woman <b>heavy with child</b>\nemerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and\nbegged the old gods for a son who would avenge her.</i></p><p>These are most of the references to motherhood appearing\nin the chapter (as you can see, there\u2019s quite a bit), but there\u2019s another detail\nworth bringing up. The shape and position of the moon in the sky are mentioned eight\ntime in total:</p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p><i>The moon was fat and full.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a black hole in the sky.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p><i>The moon was fat and full.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a black hole in the sky.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p>Afterward, we have Brynden telling Bran \u201c<i>it\u2019s time</i>\u201d (Bran, ADWD).

The moon \u201cfat and full\u201d\nis a clear reference to pregnancy and life, whereas the \u201ccrescent, thin and\nsharp as the blade of a knife\u201d means death. The chapter concludes with a set of\nthree visions, the first of a pregnant woman emerging from a \u201cblack pool\u201d, the\nlast of a woman with white hairs (old, I presume) slicing a boy\u2019s throat as an\noffering to the weirwood:</p><p><i>Then, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees\nbefore the heart tree.

Darkness will be\nyour cloak, your shield, <b>your mother&rsquo;s\nmilk.</b> Darkness will make you strong.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>In the beginning he had tried to count the days by making note of when\nhe woke and slept, but <b>down here\nsleeping and waking had a way of melting into one another.</b></i></p><p><i>He even crossed the slender stone bridge that arched over the abyss and\ndiscovered more passages and chambers on the far side. <b>One was full of singers, enthroned like Brynden in nests of weirwood\nroots that wove under and through and around</b> their bodies.</i></p><p><i>He wanted to put his arms around her, hold her tight <b>the way his mother used to hold him</b>\nback at Winterfell when he&rsquo;d hurt himself.</i></p><p><i>His father and the black pool and the godswood faded and were gone and\nhe was back in the cavern, <b>the pale\nthick roots of his weirwood throne cradling his limbs as a mother does a child.</b></i></p><p><i>&hellip;a woman <b>heavy with child</b>\nemerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt before the tree, and\nbegged the old gods for a son who would avenge her.</i></p><p>These are most of the references to motherhood appearing\nin the chapter (as you can see, there&rsquo;s quite a bit), but there&rsquo;s another detail\nworth bringing up. The shape and position of the moon in the sky are mentioned eight\ntime in total:</p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p><i>The moon was fat and full.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a black hole in the sky.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p><i>The moon was fat and full.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a black hole in the sky.</i></p><p><i>The moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife.</i></p><p>Afterward, we have Brynden telling Bran &ldquo;<i>it&rsquo;s time</i>&rdquo; (Bran, ADWD). We also have\nthe &ldquo;<i>woman heavy with child</i>&rdquo; from\nBran&rsquo;s last set of visions. We&rsquo;ll be reminded that there&rsquo;s nine moons in a\npregnancy. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a bit unsettling, however. The moon &ldquo;fat and full&rdquo;\nis a clear reference to pregnancy and life, whereas the &ldquo;crescent, thin and\nsharp as the blade of a knife&rdquo; means death. The chapter concludes with a set of\nthree visions, the first of a pregnant woman emerging from a &ldquo;black pool&rdquo;, the\nlast of a woman with white hairs (old, I presume) slicing a boy&rsquo;s throat as an\noffering to the weirwood:</p><p><i>Then, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees\nbefore the heart tree. A white-haired woman stepped toward them through a drift\nof dark red leaves, a bronze sickle in her hand.</i></p><p><i> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bran,\n&ldquo;no, don&rsquo; t, &rdquo; but they could not hear him, no more than his father\nhad. The woman grabbed the captive by the hair, hooked the sickle round his\nthroat, and slashed. And through the mist of centuries the broken boy could\nonly watch as the man&rsquo;s feet drummed against the earth &hellip; but as his life flowed\nout of him in a red tide, Brandon Stark could taste the blood.</i> &ndash; Bran, ADWD</p><p>I searched &ldquo;sickle&rdquo; on Google image and this is what I\ngot:</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/330beea89b6a20b66f2887836b689e13/tumblr_inline_pmgstpdgKJ1vdv8tx_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Basically, it&rsquo;s a crescent moon shaped knife. In\nfarming, it is (or was) used to harvest wheat and corn stalks. It&rsquo;s both a\nreference to death (as it&rsquo;s used to kill) and life (as it&rsquo;s used to collect\nfood). &nbsp;The sickle is actually very similar\nto the <i>arakh</i>, a signature dothraki weapon:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3839df81580ef2af11122def5b769e65/tumblr_inline_pmgsuobBLq1vdv8tx_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(You&rsquo;d knew I&rsquo;d find a way to bring Daenerys into\nthis, didn&rsquo;t you?)</p><p>But I had to, because you just can&rsquo;t talk about\npregnancy in asoiaf without mentioning the primary character associated with\nmotherhood, pregnancy, sacrifice and the moon. From this Bran chapter, one\nthing that seems connected to fertility is the rich, dampness and warmth of the\nearth. Daenerys, who believes herself to be barren, rule over a dry, barren\nland in Meereen. Droughts, deserts, dryness&hellip; she encounters it all. </p><p><i>They rode to <b>the lake the\nDothraki called the Womb of the World</b>, surrounded by a <b>fringe of reeds</b>, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand\nyears ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its depths, riding\nupon the back of the first horse.</i></p><p><i> The procession waited on the\ngrassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to the ground.\nNaked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom,\nbut Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the\ntall reeds. <b>The moon floated on the\nstill black waters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over it.</b></i><b> </b>&ndash; Daenerys, AGOT</p><p>The &ldquo;fringe of reeds&rdquo; part is interesting, since Bran is\nalso surrounded by &ldquo;reeds&rdquo; (Jojen and Meera) when inside the &ldquo;womb&rdquo; of the\ncave, in ADWD. Anyway, Daenerys bathing in the black waters (bathing <i>with </i>the moon, I might add, just like\nshe&rsquo;s bathing with the child inside her belly) is definitely a parallel to the &ldquo;<b><i>a\nwoman heavy with child emerged naked and dripping from the black pool, knelt\nbefore the tree, and begged the old gods for a son who would avenge her</i></b>&rdquo;\npart. Odder, even, is that her child will be sacrificed, like the man sacrificed\nto the weirwood in Bran&rsquo;s vision. </p><p>The black waters are present in Bran&rsquo;s cave as well:</p><p><i>&ldquo;The river you hear is swift and black, and flows down and down to\na sunless sea.&rdquo;</i> &ndash; Bran, ADWD</p><p>Bran &ldquo;emerges&rdquo; from it every time he warg a raven, or\nSummer, and leaves the cave. Once, he goes into the literal black waters, and\nback up, while warged into Hodor:</p><p><i>One day Meera and Jojen decided to go see the river, despite Leaf&rsquo;s\ncautions. \"I want to come too,&rdquo; Bran said.</i></p><p><i> Meera gave him a mournful look.\nThe river was six hundred feet below, down steep slopes and twisty passages,\nshe explained, and the last part required climbing down a rope. &ldquo;Hodor\ncould never make the climb with you on his back. I&rsquo;m sorry, Bran.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> Bran remembered a time when no\none could climb as good as him, not even Robb or Jon. Part of him wanted to\nshout at them for leaving him, and another part wanted to cry. He was almost a\nman grown, though, so he said nothing. But after they were gone, he slipped\ninside Hodor&rsquo;s skin and followed them.</i> &ndash; Bran, ADWD</p><p>I <i>think </i>the\nblack waters are linked with the black moon and overall symbolize a phase of &ldquo;incubation&rdquo;.\nThe crescent shaped moon, I&rsquo;d link it with blood magic, magical sight (for\nBran) and for Daenerys, something related to the dothraki, as well as to the &ldquo;reaping\nand harvesting&rdquo; stage. You could probably view her recruitment of the dothraki in\nseason six as a form of &ldquo;harvest&rdquo;. Dany&rsquo;s army/armies and Bran&rsquo;s magical sight\nboth come at the price of blood, during the &ldquo;crescent moon phase&rdquo; of their\njourneys. That&rsquo;s where ADWD leaves them: Bran&rsquo;s last &ldquo;moon&rdquo; is a crescent\nshaped one, his chapter ending with him lost in a vision and tasting the blood of\nthe man dying at &ldquo;his&rdquo; weirwood&rsquo;s feet. &nbsp;Dany&rsquo;s\nlast chapter ends with her being surrounded by dothraki warriors in the Great\nGrass Sea. </p><p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve reached the full moon phase yet.\nThe moon &ldquo;fat and full&rdquo; will come last for them.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S as usual, pic link in the comments below.</p>",

Harry Potter: I will live and die a Ravenclaw who always thought she was a Gryffindor. Doctor Who: David Tennant will always be my Doctor. The Walking Dead: Caryl shipper and proud. Tolkien: a thousand times yes. Jane Austen: always a favorite. Photography. Music. History: primarily the history of the Wild West, especially Deadwood and Tombstone. I'm given to flights of fancy, occasionally going off the deep end. Depression and anxiety are real, don't let anyone tell you otherwise; after all, they kept me from living for the longest time. Talk to me, ask me anything. I would love it.I'm always here if you need anything, you beautiful people.\n\n\n\n<center><table cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td bgcolor=\"#A69E59\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#732626\" width=\"1\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#A69E59\" width=\"2\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#732626\" width=\"1\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#A69E59\" width=\"80\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#732626\" width=\"1\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#A69E59\" width=\"2\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#732626\" width=\"1\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#A69E59\" width=\"80\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#732626\" width=\"1\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#A69E59\" width=\"2\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#732626\" width=\"1\"></td><td bgcolor=\"#A69E59\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></td></tr></table><small><b><font face=\"times new roman\"><font color=\"#732626\">I</font> <font color=\"#A69E59\">S</font><font color=\"#732626\">O</font><font color=\"#A69E59\">L</font><font color=\"#732626\">E</font><font color=\"#A69E59\">M</font><font color=\"#732626\">N</font><font color=\"#A69E59\">L</font><font color=\"#732626\">Y</font> <font color=\"#A69E59\">S</font><font color=\"#732626\">W</font><font color=\"#A69E59\">E</font><font color=\"#732626\">A</font><font color=\"#A69E59\">R</font> <font color=\"#732626\">T</font><font color=\"#A69E59\">H</font><font color=\"#732626\">A</font><font color=\"#A69E59\">T</font><br><font color=\"#732626\">{ <a href=\"http://community.livejournal.com/citadel_icons/93214.html\"><font color=\"#732626\">I am up to no good.</font></a> }</font></font></b></small></center>\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href='http://readtheprintedword.org'><img src='http://readtheprintedword.org/rtpw-button3-200x128.png' alt='Read the Printed Word!' border='0' /></a>",
