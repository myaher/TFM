And, then she came when he called for help. Wight Hunt and Dany going North against all pragmatism, following her heart instead of her head like Tyrion wanted, being the rescuer Tyrion in ADWD correctly assessed her to be, was the turning point in Jon and Dany&rsquo;s relationship. Jon could have bent the knee to Dany out of pragmatism and that act certainly didn&rsquo;t need to lead to him thinking so highly of Dany&rsquo;s opinion. What I think Jon saw in Dany, though, was a partner, starting from the minute she came to save him and made his fight hers as well, wholeheartedly. Like Sam said, &lsquo;Jon&rsquo;s going to lead the fight against the dead. But he can&rsquo;t do it alone.&rsquo; </p>\n\n<p>Also, going back to the cave where Dany threw Jon&rsquo;s own words to Mance back at him, and maybe even back to the throne room where Dany echoed his own sentiments of not holding fathers&rsquo; crimes against their children, Jon&rsquo;s been sensing a kindred spirit in Dany. Then she turns out to be someone he can rely on, depend on, whose impulses echo his own, who can be a true partner. There has been no other character who has done this for Jon in the story till now. There&rsquo;s been no one like this for him in the books yet, either.</p>\n\n<p>So, the script flat out saying Davos and Dany are the two people Jon looks to because their opinion matters most to him is quite apt.</p>",

Then she turns out to be someone he can rely on, depend on, whose impulses echo his own, who can be a true partner. There has been no other character who has done this for Jon in the story till now.

Every shot should have a purpose, chosen in a way to propel the story forward, much like a every choice of word should help build a novel. There is a lot of talk lately about how the finale of 7x07 was framed and whether or not it\u2019s cinematically meant to be seen as romantic or ominous. This is something I\u2019m going to attempt to address, but looking at this one scene is like walking in during the middle of a conversation. You don\u2019t have context to the story and things can be a bit confusing. So what I hope to address is the way that cinema has told the story of Jon and Dany\u2019s romance, as well as address the boat scene itself.</p><p>This is going to be as unbiased as I can get and not all of it might be to your liking. As with any art form, this is my interpretation and where the evidence has lead me, no different than analyzing a book. Hopefully this can help others see it from a different point of view, clear some things up or just make for interesting debate.</p><p>One of the common complaints about the finale is about the lack of first kiss between Jon and Dany. It\u2019s usually compared to Talisa and Robb, who had a kiss and began tearing off each other\u2019s clothes. Love scenes tend to follow a certain pattern in stories, especially shows. What is given a lot of emphasis is the first kiss, which is the moment that tension is released and passions are given into. The show has followed that route with a number of romances&hellip;to a point.</p><p>In actuality, each relationship follows a certain theme and emphasis is placed on that. For instance, Gilly and Sam did eventually make love, but it happened much, much later. It was a quick shot and then eventually cut with Sam and Jon talking about what happened. When you see a number of Gilly and Sam scenes, the intimacy isn\u2019t based on touch, kiss or anything else, the focus is on <i>words.</i>\u00a0Words are important with their relationship because of who Sam is and what storytelling means to him. Notice that Gilly reads in a number of scenes with Sam. She even chooses to name her child Baby Sam after Sam tells a story to her and sings about the gods. We\u2019ve had it established that books are important to him, it\u2019s one of the reasons he was forced to become a Black Brother. For Gilly to read, we\u2019re being shown a connection to Sam\u2019s passion that he doesn\u2019t really share with anyone else. It\u2019s a bridge that connects them and gives them intimacy. We don\u2019t need to see Sam and Gilly have sex because that emotional bond is being forged through words and storytelling.</p><p>The same is used for Jaime and Brienne. Rather than it being the usual conventions of flirting, touch or anything else, their connection and intimacy comes through honor, something Jaime can\u2019t share with anyone else. What is one of the more romantic scenes in the show between them? It\u2019s when Jaime sends Brienne off to fulfill his oath, giving her his sword and she names it\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d. She understands that honor is something that is important to Jaime, but he has never felt he has lived up to, having to make a number of difficult decisions that take him away from that path. The relationship progresses when Brienne has fulfilled his oath and offers the sword back but he tells her that it is hers and has always been hers. That is his form of\u00a0\u201cI love you\u201d, putting more emphasis on what she has represented and given him symbolically rather than the usual methods of imparting the emotion through the generic statement. (Contrast that to Jaime and Cersei where the words are said but have less meaning.)</p><p>Talisa and Robb follow the convention, but it has a reason. By the two of them succumbing to passions and sharing a kiss, it displays that lust overpowers reason. Robb talks about his betrothal to declaring he doesn\u2019t want to marry Roslin to making love to Talisa. We\u2019re not supposed to view this as a unique and rare romance. Cinematically, it\u2019s no different than the sextoposition scenes. We have more shots of Robb undressed or disheveled than anything else. The physical is given more weight thematically.</p><p>We have less of those moments with the more important romances that tend to stick out for others. Jaime/Brienne, Sam/Gilly, Arya/Gendry even. So the idea that because there aren\u2019t many kissing scenes discounts Jonerys is erroneous at best. They aren\u2019t necessary to impart romance to a story.</p><p>So if these other romances have followed their own theme and pattern, what is Jon and Dany\u2019s?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a66fbb380651d30dca0cc1265b6b59f7/tumblr_inline_pd0wakcHMG1tr2x3r_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure><p>Touch.</p><p>From the very beginning of their relationship, space and touch is where the emphasis of romance is placed for Jon and Dany. It\u2019s such a subtle thing that it can easily be missed and mistaken. If people are expecting the usual conventions, it can be underwhelming to just see hand holding and coming into each other\u2019s space. What we need is to look at how Jon and Dany are framed cinematically against their other relationships.</p><p>Jon and Dany have kissed and had sex with other people before. Dany especially has had a fairly healthy sex life and isn\u2019t shy about these sorts of things. Their early romances have an emphasis on kissing and other sexual activities, but focus was never paid to the small, more intimate acts of hand holding or a simple gentle touch. That sort of things implies vulnerability and equality, which they never have really had before. There was always a barrier between them and their partners. Drogo was dominant of Dany and had authority over her (however much she could persuade him to do as she wanted). Daario was always her subject and there was never enough trust between them for her to show that sort of vulnerability. Meanwhile for Jon, there was a divide between him and Ygritte which were his Night\u2019s Watch vows as well as the inevitability of him having to leave. Lust was more important because it was giving in to something, a release of tension.</p><p>That tension comes in a different form for Dany and Jon, which is them being an equal to someone. Touch is set apart because it requires a certain level of trust and vulnerability, something they haven\u2019t really displayed before. It\u2019s interesting to note that from their very first meeting, whenever Jon and Dany are alone together, they are usually in each other\u2019s space.</p><p>From the cave scene where they are in close proximity to each other, to when they walk side by side after she returns from the Field of Fire, to when she is sitting at his bedside after the Wall, every scene alone, they are often in the same shot together, displaying intimacy and connection. While Jon and Dany are often all business, discussing their leadership positions and concerns (which shows their mind isn\u2019t far from what they have to do), they still have a connection pulling them together.</p><p>The reason we are not given a first kiss is because it isn\u2019t necessary and comes in a different form. It\u2019s arguable that their first kiss is when Dany takes Jon\u2019s hand just after he pledges himself to her. The scene is framed in a romantic manner with the camera first lingering on their hands to showing Jon\u2019s look of reverence and awe, to Dany\u2019s vulnerability. They breached each other\u2019s walls and released the tension just by touch. This is their symbolic moment of declaration, similar to Jaime telling Brienne is sword has always belonged to her or Arya telling Gendry that he could be her family. It\u2019s not conventional and meant to stand apart as a unique moment in the show. Emphasis is placed on that action not once, not twice, but three times in the space of one scene. First Jon taking her hand as Dany starts to break down, Dany taking his hand after he pledges to her, and finally Jon keeping hold of her hand as she tries to draw away. This is when they are declaring their feelings to each other and are giving in to their passions, equal to Robb\u2019s moment with Talisa but in a different format.</p><p>Add in the other moments that they take further steps in their relationship. Jon takes Dany\u2019s arm twice in the cave. In this scene, they begin to realize they are attracted to each other and connect on a more personal level. All of it begins with him taking her arm and leading her a bit further in the cave.</p><p>The relationship is solidified in the Dragonpit during their conversation about House Targaryen. Their fingers brush twice, first when Jon hands Dany the Dragon skull and once again when she gives it back. The more significant shot being the latter, as the camera lingers on their hands. In that moment, Dany is telling Jon about how House Targaryen became small and broken. Just after their fingers linger, he tells Dany she isn\u2019t like anyone else and their family hasn\u2019t seen their last. This is Jon\u2019s moment of commitment to her and arguably the moment he decides to have a future with her.</p><p>These moments have a common connection, that being touch and a lingering shot of their hands.</p><p>So taking cinematic framing of Jon and Dany\u2019s more intimate moments, should we call their lovemaking scene romantic thematically?</p><p>Well, yes and no.</p><p>Technically, the finale is not meant to be completely romantic (and I realize this is where I will lose some of you.) Let me explain.</p><p>Looking at the structures of that scene, the emphasis is not completely placed on Jon and Dany, it\u2019s about the revelation and what it will affect. Technically, that moment is about suspense.</p><p>In one of my previous metas, I quoted Alfred Hitchcock and his break down of what suspense is as opposed to a twist. If we apply what we describe, we see that the finale is more about suspense than it is about romance. We are being shown the bomb under the table as it ticks down, meanwhile the people seated around it have no idea that it is about to detonate.</p><p>The bomb in this case is Jon\u2019s identity and place as heir to the Iron Throne. At the same time, Jon and Dany finally physically consummate their relationship as Bran imparts the truth to the audience. Following Game of Thrones\u2019 standard means of building suspense, we the audience are being let in on the plot point about to happen, no different than us being shown the candle in wildfire just before the Sept is going to blow up.</p><p>But does this mean that the scene is ominous? No, not completely. While there are ominous overtones, in actuality, the framing of the scene is meant to convey romance, tragedy and hope.</p><p>Let\u2019s break down the scene, starting with the framework.</p><p>Framework in cinema is the structure around a story. One of the best examples is the Princess Bride where you have the grandfather reading the book to his grandson. At the same time, we see the story playing out, only at times to be interrupted and commented on by the grandson. The theme is about love and how it translates in a number of ways, one being romance, the other between family. It\u2019s not dependent on generation and a story about love can bridge gaps.</p><p>The framing device around this scene is about truth and it comes in the form of Bran. We begin the scene with Bran and Sam talking about Jon\u2019s parentage and Bran using his sight to see the moment that Rhaegar and Lyanna were married. It\u2019s an instant cut and the music begins playing in that moment, hopeful and sweet. We hear their vows set against the music, first seeing Rhaegar and Lyanna\u2019s hands connected together (similar to Jon and Dany touching as they passed the dragon skull earlier.) We then have a shot of Rhaegar, his face partially obscured by shadows and at a profile, going to Lyanna who is more in the light. They kiss and we are given a moment of intimacy to show these two are in love.</p><p>In the next shot, we see the Targaryen symbol before Jon comes into frame, partially obscured by shadows and at a profile as well. Bran says the words\u00a0\u201cHe loved her\u201d. Jon knocks at the door and Dany answers, more in the light as Lyanna was:\u00a0\u201cAnd she loved him.\u201d</p><p>We are given a moment of intimacy and vulnerability on Jon\u2019s part as we see the look on his face, hopeful, expectant but afraid. Dany steps back and opens the door. Jon comes in and shuts the door behind him, shutting out the world and the audience from what follows. What happens in that moment behind the door isn\u2019t important because we already had that scene in the episode before and in several scenes earlier. Compared to that, a kiss and ripping off clothes is small and common place.</p><p>We then have shots of Tyrion and Jon\u2019s name, both quick moments but meant to help impart suspense. We come back to Jon and Dany already making love. The nudity is extremely toned down for HBO and isn\u2019t where the emphasis is placed, is on Bran\u2019s words, the music and the look between them. The lighting is soft, as is often done for romantic scenes. We pan in, creating a tight frame for the two of them, not only showing connection between them but keeping the focus less on the act and more on them.</p><p>The music begins to swell as we have a shot of Dany\u2019s face, vulnerable, open and in love. Bran begins to speak the important words, revealing one aspect of the truth in that moment. We then cut to Jon who is overwhelmed, breathing heavily and staring at Dany with similar awe to the hand holding scene. This is the important shot because the music quiets and focuses on him and Bran\u2019s words\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the heir to the Iron Throne.\u201d The music crashes into a crescendo as Jon dives down to kiss Dany with more passion than before. The scene then ends with Tyrion\u2019s dark expression of concern.</p><p>So how do I interpret something positive from that moment as we have a framing device meant to build up suspense and concern? For one thing, the parallel shots of Jon/Dany and Rhaegar/Lyanna. It\u2019s no small thing that we are told they love each other. It\u2019s meant to be the other\u00a0\u201ctruth\u201d that comes out during this scene, aside from Jon\u2019s parentage. We could have been told Jon was the heir in a separate scene (and technically were), but this is being played out against Jon and Dany making love. In part, yes, unknowing incest, but that family connection isn\u2019t what is being played up, it\u2019s his position as heir.</p><p>What is meant to show hope is both the music and the shot of Jon and Dany\u2019s look. The intensity of passion and the feeling shared between them is meant to tell the audience that despite this coming bombshell, the two of them are so far gone in each other that it is unlikely that they can\u2019t whether through this together. After all, the director himself came out and said that the important part of the story isn\u2019t that they were having sex, it\u2019s that look that passes between them.</p><p>If we were meant to find this completely ominous, we wouldn\u2019t be given the swell of romantic music or the shots of their faces.</p><p>We are still meant to be concerned, but whether this ends up panning out is another matter. Don\u2019t forget that something similar was done in the Season 6 finale. Just as Cersei is being crowned queen, the camera shot goes to Jaime looking disturbed and afraid. We were left to wonder what that look meant and whether or not that there would be conflict in the coming season, perhaps Jaime turning against Cersei or actively mistrusting her. In the end, we did kind of get that, but it came much later and under different circumstances, where Jaime\u2019s honor conflicted with Cersei\u2019s plans.</p><p>The finale has meaning and is meant to impart information, but it\u2019s also in a way a cliffhanger, asking us to come back and see what happens next. This isn\u2019t the final story for Jon and Dany, this is just the beginning. So while yes, we are building suspense for a coming conflict, it\u2019s not completely the focus of the scene, it\u2019s where Jon and Dany are ending up.</p><p>But neither is the scene meant to be completely romantic. We already have had a number of moments that were meant to convey emotion and love. It\u2019s not wholly one or the other, it\u2019s both at the same time. We can\u2019t completely remove one component without having the entire scene collapse in on itself.</p><p>What this scene truly is, is a look at what is coming. It\u2019s the coming information about who Jon is, the questioning of his identity as well as what this means for his future, along with being a bump in the road for their relationship. At the same time, it\u2019s showing that Jon and Dany have committed to each other at a deeper level. Whatever dangers they are facing, they face it together, including the truth to come.</p><p>Everything that follows for now is speculation, and we get that hint as the boat sails off towards an unknown future, departing into darkness.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting as well that this was not the final scene in the episode. The final scene is the Night King bringing down the Wall. That was the image that the show runners wanted to leave us with. Because everything else is minor against the war between the living and the dead. The Game of Thrones has always been the smaller war, and who is King doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as survival, which is now more guaranteed with Jon and Dany together.</p>",

It\u2019s not conventional and meant to stand apart as a unique moment in the show. Emphasis is placed on that action not once, not twice, but three times in the space of one scene. First Jon taking her hand as Dany starts to break down, Dany taking his hand after he pledges to her, and finally Jon keeping hold of her hand as she tries to draw away. This is when they are declaring their feelings to each other and are giving in to their passions, equal to Robb\u2019s moment with Talisa but in a different format.</p><p>Add in the other moments that they take further steps in their relationship. Jon takes Dany\u2019s arm twice in the cave. In this scene, they begin to realize they are attracted to each other and connect on a more personal level. All of it begins with him taking her arm and leading her a bit further in the cave.</p><p>The relationship is solidified in the Dragonpit during their conversation about House Targaryen. Their fingers brush twice, first when Jon hands Dany the Dragon skull and once again when she gives it back. The more significant shot being the latter, as the camera lingers on their hands. In that moment, Dany is telling Jon about how House Targaryen became small and broken. Just after their fingers linger, he tells Dany she isn\u2019t like anyone else and their family hasn\u2019t seen their last. This is Jon\u2019s moment of commitment to her and arguably the moment he decides to have a future with her.</p><p>These moments have a common connection, that being touch and a lingering shot of their hands.</p><p>So taking cinematic framing of Jon and Dany\u2019s more intimate moments, should we call their lovemaking scene romantic thematically?</p><p>Well, yes and no.</p><p>Technically, the finale is not meant to be completely romantic (and I realize this is where I will lose some of you.) Let me explain.</p><p>Looking at the structures of that scene, the emphasis is not completely placed on Jon and Dany, it\u2019s about the revelation and what it will affect. Technically, that moment is about suspense.</p><p>In one of my previous metas, I quoted Alfred Hitchcock and his break down of what suspense is as opposed to a twist. If we apply what we describe, we see that the finale is more about suspense than it is about romance. We are being shown the bomb under the table as it ticks down, meanwhile the people seated around it have no idea that it is about to detonate.</p><p>The bomb in this case is Jon\u2019s identity and place as heir to the Iron Throne. At the same time, Jon and Dany finally physically consummate their relationship as Bran imparts the truth to the audience. Following Game of Thrones\u2019 standard means of building suspense, we the audience are being let in on the plot point about to happen, no different than us being shown the candle in wildfire just before the Sept is going to blow up.</p><p>But does this mean that the scene is ominous? No, not completely. While there are ominous overtones, in actuality, the framing of the scene is meant to convey romance, tragedy and hope.</p><p>Let\u2019s break down the scene, starting with the framework.</p><p>Framework in cinema is the structure around a story. One of the best examples is the Princess Bride where you have the grandfather reading the book to his grandson. At the same time, we see the story playing out, only at times to be interrupted and commented on by the grandson. The theme is about love and how it translates in a number of ways, one being romance, the other between family. It\u2019s not dependent on generation and a story about love can bridge gaps.</p><p>The framing device around this scene is about truth and it comes in the form of Bran. We begin the scene with Bran and Sam talking about Jon\u2019s parentage and Bran using his sight to see the moment that Rhaegar and Lyanna were married. It\u2019s an instant cut and the music begins playing in that moment, hopeful and sweet. We hear their vows set against the music, first seeing Rhaegar and Lyanna\u2019s hands connected together (similar to Jon and Dany touching as they passed the dragon skull earlier.) We then have a shot of Rhaegar, his face partially obscured by shadows and at a profile, going to Lyanna who is more in the light. They kiss and we are given a moment of intimacy to show these two are in love.</p><p>In the next shot, we see the Targaryen symbol before Jon comes into frame, partially obscured by shadows and at a profile as well. Bran says the words\u00a0\u201cHe loved her\u201d. Jon knocks at the door and Dany answers, more in the light as Lyanna was:\u00a0\u201cAnd she loved him.\u201d</p><p>We are given a moment of intimacy and vulnerability on Jon\u2019s part as we see the look on his face, hopeful, expectant but afraid. Dany steps back and opens the door. Jon comes in and shuts the door behind him, shutting out the world and the audience from what follows. What happens in that moment behind the door isn\u2019t important because we already had that scene in the episode before and in several scenes earlier. Compared to that, a kiss and ripping off clothes is small and common place.</p><p>We then have shots of Tyrion and Jon\u2019s name, both quick moments but meant to help impart suspense. We come back to Jon and Dany already making love. The nudity is extremely toned down for HBO and isn\u2019t where the emphasis is placed, is on Bran\u2019s words, the music and the look between them. The lighting is soft, as is often done for romantic scenes. We pan in, creating a tight frame for the two of them, not only showing connection between them but keeping the focus less on the act and more on them.</p><p>The music begins to swell as we have a shot of Dany\u2019s face, vulnerable, open and in love. Bran begins to speak the important words, revealing one aspect of the truth in that moment. We then cut to Jon who is overwhelmed, breathing heavily and staring at Dany with similar awe to the hand holding scene. This is the important shot because the music quiets and focuses on him and Bran\u2019s words\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s the heir to the Iron Throne.\u201d The music crashes into a crescendo as Jon dives down to kiss Dany with more passion than before. The scene then ends with Tyrion\u2019s dark expression of concern.</p><p>So how do I interpret something positive from that moment as we have a framing device meant to build up suspense and concern? For one thing, the parallel shots of Jon/Dany and Rhaegar/Lyanna. It\u2019s no small thing that we are told they love each other. It\u2019s meant to be the other\u00a0\u201ctruth\u201d that comes out during this scene, aside from Jon\u2019s parentage. We could have been told Jon was the heir in a separate scene (and technically were), but this is being played out against Jon and Dany making love. In part, yes, unknowing incest, but that family connection isn\u2019t what is being played up, it\u2019s his position as heir.</p><p>What is meant to show hope is both the music and the shot of Jon and Dany\u2019s look. The intensity of passion and the feeling shared between them is meant to tell the audience that despite this coming bombshell, the two of them are so far gone in each other that it is unlikely that they can\u2019t whether through this together. After all, the director himself came out and said that the important part of the story isn\u2019t that they were having sex, it\u2019s that look that passes between them.</p><p>If we were meant to find this completely ominous, we wouldn\u2019t be given the swell of romantic music or the shots of their faces.</p><p>We are still meant to be concerned, but whether this ends up panning out is another matter. Don\u2019t forget that something similar was done in the Season 6 finale. Just as Cersei is being crowned queen, the camera shot goes to Jaime looking disturbed and afraid. We were left to wonder what that look meant and whether or not that there would be conflict in the coming season, perhaps Jaime turning against Cersei or actively mistrusting her. In the end, we did kind of get that, but it came much later and under different circumstances, where Jaime\u2019s honor conflicted with Cersei\u2019s plans.</p><p>The finale has meaning and is meant to impart information, but it\u2019s also in a way a cliffhanger, asking us to come back and see what happens next. This isn\u2019t the final story for Jon and Dany, this is just the beginning. So while yes, we are building suspense for a coming conflict, it\u2019s not completely the focus of the scene, it\u2019s where Jon and Dany are ending up.</p><p>But neither is the scene meant to be completely romantic. We already have had a number of moments that were meant to convey emotion and love. It\u2019s not wholly one or the other, it\u2019s both at the same time. We can\u2019t completely remove one component without having the entire scene collapse in on itself.</p><p>What this scene truly is, is a look at what is coming. It\u2019s the coming information about who Jon is, the questioning of his identity as well as what this means for his future, along with being a bump in the road for their relationship. At the same time, it\u2019s showing that Jon and Dany have committed to each other at a deeper level. Whatever dangers they are facing, they face it together, including the truth to come.</p><p>Everything that follows for now is speculation, and we get that hint as the boat sails off towards an unknown future, departing into darkness.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting as well that this was not the final scene in the episode. The final scene is the Night King bringing down the Wall. That was the image that the show runners wanted to leave us with. Because everything else is minor against the war between the living and the dead. The Game of Thrones has always been the smaller war, and who is King doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as survival, which is now more guaranteed with Jon and Dany together.</p></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p><h1>Cinematic Jonerys</h1><p>It\u2019s easy to forget sometimes that cinema is a language in itself. Every shot should have a purpose, chosen in a way to propel the story forward, much like a every choice of word should help build a novel. There is a lot of talk lately about how the finale of 7x07 was framed and whether or not it\u2019s cinematically meant to be seen as romantic or ominous. This is something I\u2019m going to attempt to address, but looking at this one scene is like walking in during the middle of a conversation. You don\u2019t have context to the story and things can be a bit confusing. So what I hope to address is the way that cinema has told the story of Jon and Dany\u2019s romance, as well as address the boat scene itself.</p><p>This is going to be as unbiased as I can get and not all of it might be to your liking. As with any art form, this is my interpretation and where the evidence has lead me, no different than analyzing a book. Hopefully this can help others see it from a different point of view, clear some things up or just make for interesting debate.</p><p>One of the common complaints about the finale is about the lack of first kiss between Jon and Dany. It\u2019s usually compared to Talisa and Robb, who had a kiss and began tearing off each other\u2019s clothes. Love scenes tend to follow a certain pattern in stories, especially shows. What is given a lot of emphasis is the first kiss, which is the moment that tension is released and passions are given into. The show has followed that route with a number of romances\u2026to a point.</p><p>In actuality, each relationship follows a certain theme and emphasis is placed on that. For instance, Gilly and Sam did eventually make love, but it happened much, much later. It was a quick shot and then eventually cut with Sam and Jon talking about what happened. When you see a number of Gilly and Sam scenes, the intimacy isn\u2019t based on touch, kiss or anything else, the focus is on <i>words.</i>\u00a0Words are important with their relationship because of who Sam is and what storytelling means to him. Notice that Gilly reads in a number of scenes with Sam. She even chooses to name her child Baby Sam after Sam tells a story to her and sings about the gods. We\u2019ve had it established that books are important to him, it\u2019s one of the reasons he was forced to become a Black Brother. For Gilly to read, we\u2019re being shown a connection to Sam\u2019s passion that he doesn\u2019t really share with anyone else. It\u2019s a bridge that connects them and gives them intimacy. We don\u2019t need to see Sam and Gilly have sex because that emotional bond is being forged through words and storytelling.</p><p>The same is used for Jaime and Brienne. Rather than it being the usual conventions of flirting, touch or anything else, their connection and intimacy comes through honor, something Jaime can\u2019t share with anyone else. What is one of the more romantic scenes in the show between them? It\u2019s when Jaime sends Brienne off to fulfill his oath, giving her his sword and she names it\u00a0\u201cOathkeeper\u201d. She understands that honor is something that is important to Jaime, but he has never felt he has lived up to, having to make a number of difficult decisions that take him away from that path. The relationship progresses when Brienne has fulfilled his oath and offers the sword back but he tells her that it is hers and has always been hers. That is his form of\u00a0\u201cI love you\u201d, putting more emphasis on what she has represented and given him symbolically rather than the usual methods of imparting the emotion through the generic statement. (Contrast that to Jaime and Cersei where the words are said but have less meaning.)</p><p>Talisa and Robb follow the convention, but it has a reason. By the two of them succumbing to passions and sharing a kiss, it displays that lust overpowers reason. Robb talks about his betrothal to declaring he doesn\u2019t want to marry Roslin to making love to Talisa. We\u2019re not supposed to view this as a unique and rare romance. Cinematically, it\u2019s no different than the sextoposition scenes. We have more shots of Robb undressed or disheveled than anything else. The physical is given more weight thematically.</p><p>We have less of those moments with the more important romances that tend to stick out for others. Jaime/Brienne, Sam/Gilly, Arya/Gendry even. So the idea that because there aren\u2019t many kissing scenes discounts Jonerys is erroneous at best. They aren\u2019t necessary to impart romance to a story.</p><p>So if these other romances have followed their own theme and pattern, what is Jon and Dany\u2019s?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a66fbb380651d30dca0cc1265b6b59f7/tumblr_inline_pd0wakcHMG1tr2x3r_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"268\" data-orig-width=\"268\"></figure><p>Touch.</p><p>From the very beginning of their relationship, space and touch is where the emphasis of romance is placed for Jon and Dany. It\u2019s such a subtle thing that it can easily be missed and mistaken. If people are expecting the usual conventions, it can be underwhelming to just see hand holding and coming into each other\u2019s space. What we need is to look at how Jon and Dany are framed cinematically against their other relationships.</p><p>Jon and Dany have kissed and had sex with other people before. Dany especially has had a fairly healthy sex life and isn\u2019t shy about these sorts of things. Their early romances have an emphasis on kissing and other sexual activities, but focus was never paid to the small, more intimate acts of hand holding or a simple gentle touch. That sort of things implies vulnerability and equality, which they never have really had before. There was always a barrier between them and their partners. Drogo was dominant of Dany and had authority over her (however much she could persuade him to do as she wanted). Daario was always her subject and there was never enough trust between them for her to show that sort of vulnerability. Meanwhile for Jon, there was a divide between him and Ygritte which were his Night\u2019s Watch vows as well as the inevitability of him having to leave. Lust was more important because it was giving in to something, a release of tension.</p><p>That tension comes in a different form for Dany and Jon, which is them being an equal to someone. Touch is set apart because it requires a certain level of trust and vulnerability, something they haven\u2019t really displayed before. It\u2019s interesting to note that from their very first meeting, whenever Jon and Dany are alone together, they are usually in each other\u2019s space.</p><p>From the cave scene where they are in close proximity to each other, to when they walk side by side after she returns from the Field of Fire, to when she is sitting at his bedside after the Wall, every scene alone, they are often in the same shot together, displaying intimacy and connection. While Jon and Dany are often all business, discussing their leadership positions and concerns (which shows their mind isn\u2019t far from what they have to do), they still have a connection pulling them together.</p><p>The reason we are not given a first kiss is because it isn\u2019t necessary and comes in a different form. It\u2019s arguable that their first kiss is when Dany takes Jon\u2019s hand just after he pledges himself to her. The scene is framed in a romantic manner with the camera first lingering on their hands to showing Jon\u2019s look of reverence and awe, to Dany\u2019s vulnerability. They breached each other\u2019s walls and released the tension just by touch. This is their symbolic moment of declaration, similar to Jaime telling Brienne is sword has always belonged to her or Arya telling Gendry that he could be her family. It\u2019s not conventional and meant to stand apart as a unique moment in the show. Emphasis is placed on that action not once, not twice, but three times in the space of one scene. First Jon taking her hand as Dany starts to break down, Dany taking his hand after he pledges to her, and finally Jon keeping hold of her hand as she tries to draw away. This is when they are declaring their feelings to each other and are giving in to their passions, equal to Robb\u2019s moment with Talisa but in a different format.</p><p>Add in the other moments that they take further steps in their relationship. Jon takes Dany\u2019s arm twice in the cave. In this scene, they begin to realize they are attracted to each other and connect on a more personal level. All of it begins with him taking her arm and leading her a bit further in the cave.</p><p>The relationship is solidified in the Dragonpit during their conversation about House Targaryen. Their fingers brush twice, first when Jon hands Dany the Dragon skull and once again when she gives it back. The more significant shot being the latter, as the camera lingers on their hands. In that moment, Dany is telling Jon about how House Targaryen became small and broken. Just after their fingers linger, he tells Dany she isn\u2019t like anyone else and their family hasn\u2019t seen their last. This is Jon\u2019s moment of commitment to her and arguably the moment he decides to have a future with her.</p><p>These moments have a common connection, that being touch and a lingering shot of their hands.</p><p>So taking cinematic framing of Jon and Dany\u2019s more intimate moments, should we call their lovemaking scene romantic thematically?</p><p>Well, yes and no.</p><p>Technically, the finale is not meant to be completely romantic (and I realize this is where I will lose some of you.) Let me explain.</p><p>Looking at the structures of that scene, the emphasis is not completely placed on Jon and Dany, it\u2019s about the revelation and what it will affect.

In the end, we did kind of get that, but it came much later and under different circumstances, where Jaime\u2019s honor conflicted with Cersei\u2019s plans.</p><p>The finale has meaning and is meant to impart information, but it\u2019s also in a way a cliffhanger, asking us to come back and see what happens next. This isn\u2019t the final story for Jon and Dany, this is just the beginning. So while yes, we are building suspense for a coming conflict, it\u2019s not completely the focus of the scene, it\u2019s where Jon and Dany are ending up.</p><p>But neither is the scene meant to be completely romantic. We already have had a number of moments that were meant to convey emotion and love. It\u2019s not wholly one or the other, it\u2019s both at the same time. We can\u2019t completely remove one component without having the entire scene collapse in on itself.</p><p>What this scene truly is, is a look at what is coming. It\u2019s the coming information about who Jon is, the questioning of his identity as well as what this means for his future, along with being a bump in the road for their relationship. At the same time, it\u2019s showing that Jon and Dany have committed to each other at a deeper level. Whatever dangers they are facing, they face it together, including the truth to come.</p><p>Everything that follows for now is speculation, and we get that hint as the boat sails off towards an unknown future, departing into darkness.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting as well that this was not the final scene in the episode. The final scene is the Night King bringing down the Wall. That was the image that the show runners wanted to leave us with. Because everything else is minor against the war between the living and the dead. The Game of Thrones has always been the smaller war, and who is King doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as survival, which is now more guaranteed with Jon and Dany together.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Cinematic Jonerys</h1><p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget sometimes that cinema is a language in itself. Every shot should have a purpose, chosen in a way to propel the story forward, much like a every choice of word should help build a novel. There is a lot of talk lately about how the finale of 7x07 was framed and whether or not it&rsquo;s cinematically meant to be seen as romantic or ominous. This is something I&rsquo;m going to attempt to address, but looking at this one scene is like walking in during the middle of a conversation. You don&rsquo;t have context to the story and things can be a bit confusing. So what I hope to address is the way that cinema has told the story of Jon and Dany&rsquo;s romance, as well as address the boat scene itself.</p><p>This is going to be as unbiased as I can get and not all of it might be to your liking. As with any art form, this is my interpretation and where the evidence has lead me, no different than analyzing a book. Hopefully this can help others see it from a different point of view, clear some things up or just make for interesting debate.</p><p>One of the common complaints about the finale is about the lack of first kiss between Jon and Dany. It&rsquo;s usually compared to Talisa and Robb, who had a kiss and began tearing off each other&rsquo;s clothes. Love scenes tend to follow a certain pattern in stories, especially shows. What is given a lot of emphasis is the first kiss, which is the moment that tension is released and passions are given into. The show has followed that route with a number of romances&hellip;to a point.</p><p>In actuality, each relationship follows a certain theme and emphasis is placed on that. For instance, Gilly and Sam did eventually make love, but it happened much, much later. It was a quick shot and then eventually cut with Sam and Jon talking about what happened. When you see a number of Gilly and Sam scenes, the intimacy isn&rsquo;t based on touch, kiss or anything else, the focus is on <i>words.</i>&nbsp;Words are important with their relationship because of who Sam is and what storytelling means to him. Notice that Gilly reads in a number of scenes with Sam. She even chooses to name her child Baby Sam after Sam tells a story to her and sings about the gods. We&rsquo;ve had it established that books are important to him, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons he was forced to become a Black Brother. For Gilly to read, we&rsquo;re being shown a connection to Sam&rsquo;s passion that he doesn&rsquo;t really share with anyone else. It&rsquo;s a bridge that connects them and gives them intimacy. We don&rsquo;t need to see Sam and Gilly have sex because that emotional bond is being forged through words and storytelling.</p><p>The same is used for Jaime and Brienne. Rather than it being the usual conventions of flirting, touch or anything else, their connection and intimacy comes through honor, something Jaime can&rsquo;t share with anyone else. What is one of the more romantic scenes in the show between them? It&rsquo;s when Jaime sends Brienne off to fulfill his oath, giving her his sword and she names it&nbsp;&ldquo;Oathkeeper&rdquo;. She understands that honor is something that is important to Jaime, but he has never felt he has lived up to, having to make a number of difficult decisions that take him away from that path. The relationship progresses when Brienne has fulfilled his oath and offers the sword back but he tells her that it is hers and has always been hers. That is his form of&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you&rdquo;, putting more emphasis on what she has represented and given him symbolically rather than the usual methods of imparting the emotion through the generic statement. (Contrast that to Jaime and Cersei where the words are said but have less meaning.)</p><p>Talisa and Robb follow the convention, but it has a reason. By the two of them succumbing to passions and sharing a kiss, it displays that lust overpowers reason. Robb talks about his betrothal to declaring he doesn&rsquo;t want to marry Roslin to making love to Talisa. We&rsquo;re not supposed to view this as a unique and rare romance. Cinematically, it&rsquo;s no different than the sextoposition scenes. We have more shots of Robb undressed or disheveled than anything else. The physical is given more weight thematically.</p><p>We have less of those moments with the more important romances that tend to stick out for others. Jaime/Brienne, Sam/Gilly, Arya/Gendry even. So the idea that because there aren&rsquo;t many kissing scenes discounts Jonerys is erroneous at best. They aren&rsquo;t necessary to impart romance to a story.</p><p>So if these other romances have followed their own theme and pattern, what is Jon and Dany&rsquo;s?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a66fbb380651d30dca0cc1265b6b59f7/tumblr_inline_pd0wakcHMG1tr2x3r_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Touch.</p><p>From the very beginning of their relationship, space and touch is where the emphasis of romance is placed for Jon and Dany. It&rsquo;s such a subtle thing that it can easily be missed and mistaken. If people are expecting the usual conventions, it can be underwhelming to just see hand holding and coming into each other&rsquo;s space. What we need is to look at how Jon and Dany are framed cinematically against their other relationships.</p><p>Jon and Dany have kissed and had sex with other people before. Dany especially has had a fairly healthy sex life and isn&rsquo;t shy about these sorts of things. Their early romances have an emphasis on kissing and other sexual activities, but focus was never paid to the small, more intimate acts of hand holding or a simple gentle touch. That sort of things implies vulnerability and equality, which they never have really had before. There was always a barrier between them and their partners. Drogo was dominant of Dany and had authority over her (however much she could persuade him to do as she wanted). Daario was always her subject and there was never enough trust between them for her to show that sort of vulnerability. Meanwhile for Jon, there was a divide between him and Ygritte which were his Night&rsquo;s Watch vows as well as the inevitability of him having to leave. Lust was more important because it was giving in to something, a release of tension.</p><p>That tension comes in a different form for Dany and Jon, which is them being an equal to someone. Touch is set apart because it requires a certain level of trust and vulnerability, something they haven&rsquo;t really displayed before. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that from their very first meeting, whenever Jon and Dany are alone together, they are usually in each other&rsquo;s space.</p><p>From the cave scene where they are in close proximity to each other, to when they walk side by side after she returns from the Field of Fire, to when she is sitting at his bedside after the Wall, every scene alone, they are often in the same shot together, displaying intimacy and connection. While Jon and Dany are often all business, discussing their leadership positions and concerns (which shows their mind isn&rsquo;t far from what they have to do), they still have a connection pulling them together.</p><p>The reason we are not given a first kiss is because it isn&rsquo;t necessary and comes in a different form. It&rsquo;s arguable that their first kiss is when Dany takes Jon&rsquo;s hand just after he pledges himself to her. The scene is framed in a romantic manner with the camera first lingering on their hands to showing Jon&rsquo;s look of reverence and awe, to Dany&rsquo;s vulnerability. They breached each other&rsquo;s walls and released the tension just by touch. This is their symbolic moment of declaration, similar to Jaime telling Brienne is sword has always belonged to her or Arya telling Gendry that he could be her family. It&rsquo;s not conventional and meant to stand apart as a unique moment in the show. Emphasis is placed on that action not once, not twice, but three times in the space of one scene. First Jon taking her hand as Dany starts to break down, Dany taking his hand after he pledges to her, and finally Jon keeping hold of her hand as she tries to draw away. This is when they are declaring their feelings to each other and are giving in to their passions, equal to Robb&rsquo;s moment with Talisa but in a different format.</p><p>Add in the other moments that they take further steps in their relationship. Jon takes Dany&rsquo;s arm twice in the cave. In this scene, they begin to realize they are attracted to each other and connect on a more personal level. All of it begins with him taking her arm and leading her a bit further in the cave.</p><p>The relationship is solidified in the Dragonpit during their conversation about House Targaryen. Their fingers brush twice, first when Jon hands Dany the Dragon skull and once again when she gives it back. The more significant shot being the latter, as the camera lingers on their hands. In that moment, Dany is telling Jon about how House Targaryen became small and broken. Just after their fingers linger, he tells Dany she isn&rsquo;t like anyone else and their family hasn&rsquo;t seen their last. This is Jon&rsquo;s moment of commitment to her and arguably the moment he decides to have a future with her.</p><p>These moments have a common connection, that being touch and a lingering shot of their hands.</p><p>So taking cinematic framing of Jon and Dany&rsquo;s more intimate moments, should we call their lovemaking scene romantic thematically?</p><p>Well, yes and no.</p><p>Technically, the finale is not meant to be completely romantic (and I realize this is where I will lose some of you.) Let me explain.</p><p>Looking at the structures of that scene, the emphasis is not completely placed on Jon and Dany, it&rsquo;s about the revelation and what it will affect. Technically, that moment is about suspense.</p><p>In one of my previous metas, I quoted Alfred Hitchcock and his break down of what suspense is as opposed to a twist. If we apply what we describe, we see that the finale is more about suspense than it is about romance. We are being shown the bomb under the table as it ticks down, meanwhile the people seated around it have no idea that it is about to detonate.</p><p>The bomb in this case is Jon&rsquo;s identity and place as heir to the Iron Throne. At the same time, Jon and Dany finally physically consummate their relationship as Bran imparts the truth to the audience. Following Game of Thrones&rsquo; standard means of building suspense, we the audience are being let in on the plot point about to happen, no different than us being shown the candle in wildfire just before the Sept is going to blow up.</p><p>But does this mean that the scene is ominous? No, not completely. While there are ominous overtones, in actuality, the framing of the scene is meant to convey romance, tragedy and hope.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s break down the scene, starting with the framework.</p><p>Framework in cinema is the structure around a story. One of the best examples is the Princess Bride where you have the grandfather reading the book to his grandson. At the same time, we see the story playing out, only at times to be interrupted and commented on by the grandson. The theme is about love and how it translates in a number of ways, one being romance, the other between family. It&rsquo;s not dependent on generation and a story about love can bridge gaps.</p><p>The framing device around this scene is about truth and it comes in the form of Bran. We begin the scene with Bran and Sam talking about Jon&rsquo;s parentage and Bran using his sight to see the moment that Rhaegar and Lyanna were married. It&rsquo;s an instant cut and the music begins playing in that moment, hopeful and sweet. We hear their vows set against the music, first seeing Rhaegar and Lyanna&rsquo;s hands connected together (similar to Jon and Dany touching as they passed the dragon skull earlier.) We then have a shot of Rhaegar, his face partially obscured by shadows and at a profile, going to Lyanna who is more in the light. They kiss and we are given a moment of intimacy to show these two are in love.</p><p>In the next shot, we see the Targaryen symbol before Jon comes into frame, partially obscured by shadows and at a profile as well. Bran says the words&nbsp;&ldquo;He loved her&rdquo;. Jon knocks at the door and Dany answers, more in the light as Lyanna was:&nbsp;&ldquo;And she loved him.&rdquo;</p><p>We are given a moment of intimacy and vulnerability on Jon&rsquo;s part as we see the look on his face, hopeful, expectant but afraid. Dany steps back and opens the door. Jon comes in and shuts the door behind him, shutting out the world and the audience from what follows. What happens in that moment behind the door isn&rsquo;t important because we already had that scene in the episode before and in several scenes earlier. Compared to that, a kiss and ripping off clothes is small and common place.</p><p>We then have shots of Tyrion and Jon&rsquo;s name, both quick moments but meant to help impart suspense. We come back to Jon and Dany already making love. The nudity is extremely toned down for HBO and isn&rsquo;t where the emphasis is placed, is on Bran&rsquo;s words, the music and the look between them. The lighting is soft, as is often done for romantic scenes. We pan in, creating a tight frame for the two of them, not only showing connection between them but keeping the focus less on the act and more on them.</p><p>The music begins to swell as we have a shot of Dany&rsquo;s face, vulnerable, open and in love. Bran begins to speak the important words, revealing one aspect of the truth in that moment. We then cut to Jon who is overwhelmed, breathing heavily and staring at Dany with similar awe to the hand holding scene. This is the important shot because the music quiets and focuses on him and Bran&rsquo;s words&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the heir to the Iron Throne.&rdquo; The music crashes into a crescendo as Jon dives down to kiss Dany with more passion than before. The scene then ends with Tyrion&rsquo;s dark expression of concern.</p><p>So how do I interpret something positive from that moment as we have a framing device meant to build up suspense and concern? For one thing, the parallel shots of Jon/Dany and Rhaegar/Lyanna. It&rsquo;s no small thing that we are told they love each other. It&rsquo;s meant to be the other&nbsp;&ldquo;truth&rdquo; that comes out during this scene, aside from Jon&rsquo;s parentage. We could have been told Jon was the heir in a separate scene (and technically were), but this is being played out against Jon and Dany making love. In part, yes, unknowing incest, but that family connection isn&rsquo;t what is being played up, it&rsquo;s his position as heir.</p><p>What is meant to show hope is both the music and the shot of Jon and Dany&rsquo;s look. The intensity of passion and the feeling shared between them is meant to tell the audience that despite this coming bombshell, the two of them are so far gone in each other that it is unlikely that they can&rsquo;t whether through this together. After all, the director himself came out and said that the important part of the story isn&rsquo;t that they were having sex, it&rsquo;s that look that passes between them.</p><p>If we were meant to find this completely ominous, we wouldn&rsquo;t be given the swell of romantic music or the shots of their faces.</p><p>We are still meant to be concerned, but whether this ends up panning out is another matter. Don&rsquo;t forget that something similar was done in the Season 6 finale. Just as Cersei is being crowned queen, the camera shot goes to Jaime looking disturbed and afraid. We were left to wonder what that look meant and whether or not that there would be conflict in the coming season, perhaps Jaime turning against Cersei or actively mistrusting her. In the end, we did kind of get that, but it came much later and under different circumstances, where Jaime&rsquo;s honor conflicted with Cersei&rsquo;s plans.</p><p>The finale has meaning and is meant to impart information, but it&rsquo;s also in a way a cliffhanger, asking us to come back and see what happens next. This isn&rsquo;t the final story for Jon and Dany, this is just the beginning. So while yes, we are building suspense for a coming conflict, it&rsquo;s not completely the focus of the scene, it&rsquo;s where Jon and Dany are ending up.</p><p>But neither is the scene meant to be completely romantic. We already have had a number of moments that were meant to convey emotion and love. It&rsquo;s not wholly one or the other, it&rsquo;s both at the same time. We can&rsquo;t completely remove one component without having the entire scene collapse in on itself.</p><p>What this scene truly is, is a look at what is coming. It&rsquo;s the coming information about who Jon is, the questioning of his identity as well as what this means for his future, along with being a bump in the road for their relationship. At the same time, it&rsquo;s showing that Jon and Dany have committed to each other at a deeper level. Whatever dangers they are facing, they face it together, including the truth to come.</p><p>Everything that follows for now is speculation, and we get that hint as the boat sails off towards an unknown future, departing into darkness.</p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting as well that this was not the final scene in the episode. The final scene is the Night King bringing down the Wall. That was the image that the show runners wanted to leave us with. Because everything else is minor against the war between the living and the dead. The Game of Thrones has always been the smaller war, and who is King doesn&rsquo;t matter nearly as much as survival, which is now more guaranteed with Jon and Dany together.</p></p>",
