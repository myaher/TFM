I am uploading this now because I wasn\u2019t able to upload it last night since T/mblr was being a c/nt. After this I will be going back to posting regularly and at the times I said I would. I\u2019m incredibly sorry for the wait, my dudes. <br/></p><hr><p><i>\n\n\u201cWhat is <i>wrong </i>with you?\u201d \n\n<br/></i></p><p>The words dripped like venom from your tongue and bled with trepidation. Every part of you felt cold, but the heater ran perfectly. The snow outside was still falling, drizzling on the windowsill, the fire-escape, the railings. It was beautiful, but in this moment, you couldn\u2019t pull apart the beauty of it all. Not when your anger was solely focused on how heavy your heart felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2014 I had to g-go. (Name), please, you have to understand just how much\u2014\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to you, I get it.\u201d You snarled, tears welling up in your eyes. You wrapped your arms around your mid-section as your head lowered to avoid his crestfallen expression.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You could just imagine how much regret was swimming around in his veins by the tone of his voice alone; the expression was nowhere half as exposing as his face was.\u00a0</p><p>A slow unpleasant hiss echoed throughout the room, and your eyes met his once again, unable to keep your prying and worried eyes off him. The cuts and bruises that littered his cheekbones, chin, forehead were all staring back at you as if they knew he was your ultimate weakness. As he held his torn red mask in his hand while the other gripped onto his shoulder blade that was, no doubt, bleeding, you wondered how long it would be before you finally gave up on him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are damaged goods, Parker.\u201d You scolded, a pout lining the corners of your lips.<br/></p><p>He almost chuckled at that, but his eyes were following the trails of your tears. When you were in pain something always fired off in his head; a warning of sorts. It was his body telling him that he needed to stop it, to fix it, to do something to prevent you from hurting.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026 please?\u201d He whispered, voice shaky.\u00a0\u201cHelp me, please.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d your mouth parted once, then closed quickly. You clenched your fists, then inhaled.\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t help you,\u201d you replied defiantly, uncrossing your arms to reach for your jacket that hung precariously over the couch.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d<br/></p><p>As you slipped into your jacket, you walked to the door, heart daring to beat out of your chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re done?\u201d Peter cried after you, desperation in his voice.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You turned around before you got out the door, eyes narrowed,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve, for fuck\u2019s sake. I\u2019m going home to be with my family. I\u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m going to be happy instead of scared,\u201d you suppressed a sigh of irritation, eyes burning with tears once again.\u00a0\u201cAll the damn time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just run away!\u201d His eyes were wide and fearful, hands begging to reach out and grasp for you with the force of a scared child.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBut here I am, running away,\u201d you turned away and wrapped your hand on the doorknob,\u00a0\u201cFrom you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You didn\u2019t stick around to see if he chased after you, but you never ran down the hall as quick as you did in that moment. The elevator was too slow, so you took the stairs, chest heaving, lungs screaming. You couldn\u2019t shatter now. There was time to break later.\u00a0</p><p>When you got to the doubled doors at the exit of the building, you used your forearms to push open the door. But instead of the doors opening fully, you met with a barricade of snow. Some of it even managed to slip in through the crease of the door when you opened it slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Looking down through the glass window, you grumble in protest. A thick coat of stark white snow had climbed about halfway up the door. In that moment it was obvious; you were definitely trapped in this God forsaken building with no way out until the snow cleared up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you\u00a0<i>kidding\u00a0</i>me?\u201d You whined, forehead smacking onto the window of the door.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon! I don\u2019t wanna stay\u00a0<i>here</i>. I was winning the argument,\u201d you shoved the tip of your boot into the bottom part of the door repeatedly,\u00a0\u201cWhy, why, why, why, why\u2014\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c(Name), ah, are you\u2026 okay?\u201d A stertorous voice filled with heavy confusion brought you to slowly pick your head up from the window.\u00a0</p><p>Turning around, you came face to face with Peter. He was noticeably out of breath, hands clutching onto his abdomen, face twisted in ailment. The turmoil was eating away at his insides as he watched you practically fling yourself away from his presence like a madwoman. It only took him a few seconds to go after you, and when he heard your voice, distressed and hoarse, he ran the rest of the way to you. He was admittedly out of breath because of his injuries which made running ten times more hard work.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSnowed in\u2026\u201d you mumbled dejectedly, throwing a lazy thumb over your shoulder.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes followed to where you gestured to, eyes widening with shock before realization dawned on him. He exhaled, and loudly.\u00a0\u201cJesus Christ, (Name), I thought you were hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather would\u2019ve been,\u201d you huffed, turning back around to kick the door once more. You let out a high-pitched, strangled screech. \u201c<i>Stupid fucking door!</i>\u201d</p><p>Your words hurt, he couldn\u2019t deny it.\u00a0</p><p>Peter was a sensitive person, and when it came to you, it was like all his senses feened for your happiness. When you weren\u2019t happy, he felt every last bit of the emotion that was running around in your blood. It was all so\u00a0<i>very\u00a0</i>overwhelming.\u00a0</p><p>He cleared his throat, and you stopped. Slowly, you turned around to look at him with squinted eyes, prompting that you wanted to know what he wanted. He scratched the back of his neck and continued,\u00a0\u201cThe snow won\u2019t melt in a short period of time,\u201d he said, and you quirked an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just have Christmas here,\u201d you frowned.\u00a0\u201cWith me, I mean. Christmas with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>God, even as you looked at him like the most hated person on the planet, he still couldn\u2019t help but have no control over the roaring swarm of butterflies in his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>For a split second, your face softened, and that tender look glowed in your eyes again. It was one of his favorite looks. But before you could get too lost, the reality sunk back into your chest, and you gave him your best icy glare.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass, Bug Boy.\u201d With a forced huff, you plopped down on the ground, back pressed uncomfortably to the doubled doors.\u00a0<br/></p><p>A sigh, then, \u201c(<i>Name</i>)\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m mad at you.\u201d You fidgeted with the hem of your turtleneck sweater, trying to force down the vulnerability he brought out of you with just a movement of his lips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He was always trying to prove to you just how brilliant you were, how much he trusted you, cared about you, craved to get closer\u2014 mentally if not physically\u2014 but they were all subtle hints, and you didn\u2019t\u00a0<i>understand\u00a0</i>him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He grumbled, feet scuffling along the ground, bringing him closer to you. With a huff, he plopped down next to you, thigh instantly touching yours, emitting an electrical shock from the proximity.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You held your breath, not being able to look at him. Eyes screwed shut, breath coming out in short sporadic puffs, knees wobbly even as you sat down, heart daring to confess to the absolute admiration you had for him despite how angry you were.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The Holy Trinity.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Life was fucked up that way.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCan you be mad at me\u00a0<i>inside</i>?\u201d He nudged his shoulder to yours, his lips curving slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d</p><p>Still, you said nothing. Too busy trying to win a battle with your heart and force it silent. It was no use\u2014 no matter what you did, your heart would always beat for Peter. He was the sole purpose.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cC\u2019moooon. We can decorate, set up the Christmas tree\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a Christmas tree?\u201d You asked, eyes remaining focused elsewhere.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He smiled and stared at you with a yearning so powerful that it was hard to ignore, but still, it became unbeknownst to you. \u201cThe tree you bought me that one Christmas,\u201d he reminisced.\u00a0<br/></p><p>It was then your eyes flew up to lock with his, wide and shock-filled. \u201cPeter, that was like five years ago,\u201d he nodded, and your face softened with a sweet fondness. \u201cYou kept it?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He smiled again, and you wondered what it was about his smile that made you want to pepper his face with kisses. In moments like these, it was then you truly realized that he was the epitome of all things bright and innocent.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go inside. I promise we will decorate until are hands are trembling and our minds are nothing but mush from the wine.\u201d He stood up, offering you an expectant hand, staring at you with pink cheeks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d You quirk an eyebrow. The thought of drinking with Peter sounded interesting, but you liked to talk when you were tipsy\u2014 that wasn\u2019t always a good thing. One minute you could be laughing, and then you could be confessing to your best friend that he is, ultimately, the love of your life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, and even though you knew he was joking around, there was some part of you that wanted him to further explain the consequences of this journey.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou are very pushy, you know that?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI like to think of it as optimistic.\u201d His reply was instant, the smile never left his face. He wiggled his fingers in a gesture for you to take his hand, and you bit your lip to prevent a grin from blooming across your face.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d you slap your hand onto his, and his fingers immediately curl around your tinier ones, making a shiver crawl up your arms. \u201cBut no funny business, Parker.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you scolded in warning, looking up from the ground beneath you to catch the sight of his brown ones already staring at you, but then quickly looked away at the realization that he had been caught with the bonus of his hand still wrapped securely around yours.\u00a0<br/></p><p>In that moment, you felt heat pool in your cheeks, while his were bright as a tomato.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry, habit.\u201d He chuckled, dropping your hand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You instantly missed his warmth.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Arriving at the door, he elbowed it open while facing you, afraid that if he turned his back to you for more than a second you would run away again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Guilt climbed up your chest, squeezing at your heart, causing you to give him the best assured expression you could muster. His face lit up in retaliation, that boyish charm resurfacing over his cherubic features.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d you said, the sweet timbre of your voice causing his heart to flutter, untamed and wild.\u00a0<br/></p><p>He gave you a nod, albeit slow and hesitant, but your smile still broadened.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You nodded behind him, and walked back into the room with grace, shedding your coat when you got to the foot of the coffee table that sat in the middle of the living area. The Christmas tree, that stood tall and stunning, was in the corner and how you managed to overlook it when you were last here, you had no clue.\u00a0No lights tangled around the Christmas tree, there was no Holiday setting besides the small and almost unnoticeable decorated picture frames. Some were of you and Peter being the ridiculous dorks that you were together, and some were of Mary Jane, or Miles, and even May and Ben from before he died.\u00a0</p><p>Warm merriment consumed you, and you inhaled contently through your nose. Glancing over at Peter, you noticed he was standing by a couple of boxes labeled\u00a0\u201cChristmas things\u201d. He stared back at you bashfully, his smile reflecting the stars that shined in your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d He lifted one from the floor and gestured to the tree behind you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You gave in, signing deeply before the two of you got into the groove of decorating the tree. Somewhere along the way, you took a break and got the wine bottle then poured yourself and Peter a glass of the red liquid. It was strong, but you didn\u2019t drink enough to get intoxicated. That was for another time, when your mind was still reeling with the possibility that something of utter important might slip if not careful, and fully sober enough to catch yourself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHand me the star.\u201d You spoke in contentment, the events from earlier not as important to stress about any further.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Seconds later the star was slipped into your hand, suddenly overcome by a strong sensation when his fingers ghosted over your own. They weren\u2019t cold or too hot, they had been just the right amount of warm and the feeling delved deeper into your bones, your veins. There was a spark of something, and when it hand moved away, the warmth went with him.\u00a0</p><p>You hadn\u2019t been staring directly at him when the brief gesture happened, but when he pulled away as if something had burned into his skin, when you knew that he felt the same thing you did, it caught you completely off-guard. The action alone was enough to have your knees wobbling, and wavering.\u00a0</p><p>You gripped onto the latter, eyes wide as you steadied yourself.\u00a0\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre\u2014 Are you okay?\u201d His voice was small and raspy, filled with lethargy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you gripped the star in your hand, and reached upwards as you tried to set the ornament on the very tip of the already glowing tree. Being short had its disadvantages, and it proved even more so when your feet caught on a corner of the latter just as you were about to move onto the next higher step.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>In the blink of an eye, you had lost all sense of coordination and control of your footing.

Oh boy.\u00a0</p><p>You hummed in reply, eyes never having the decency of moving anywhere but his own brown and captivating ones. They were like the leaves on a wilting tree branch, ready to grow again, blooming into something more warm and filled with that of nature.\u00a0</p><p>You could lose yourself in them.\u00a0</p><p>His head dipped, but he didn\u2019t get any closer than that.

You wrapped your arms around your mid-section as your head lowered to avoid his crestfallen expression.\u00a0<br></p><p>You could just imagine how much regret was swimming around in his veins by the tone of his voice alone; the expression was nowhere half as exposing as his face was.\u00a0</p><p>A slow unpleasant hiss echoed throughout the room, and your eyes met his once again, unable to keep your prying and worried eyes off him. The cuts and bruises that littered his cheekbones, chin, forehead were all staring back at you as if they knew he was your ultimate weakness. As he held his torn red mask in his hand while the other gripped onto his shoulder blade that was, no doubt, bleeding, you wondered how long it would be before you finally gave up on him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are damaged goods, Parker.\u201d You scolded, a pout lining the corners of your lips.<br></p><p>He almost chuckled at that, but his eyes were following the trails of your tears. When you were in pain something always fired off in his head; a warning of sorts. It was his body telling him that he needed to stop it, to fix it, to do something to prevent you from hurting.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026 please?\u201d He whispered, voice shaky.\u00a0\u201cHelp me, please.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d your mouth parted once, then closed quickly. You clenched your fists, then inhaled.\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t help you,\u201d you replied defiantly, uncrossing your arms to reach for your jacket that hung precariously over the couch.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d<br></p><p>As you slipped into your jacket, you walked to the door, heart daring to beat out of your chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re done?\u201d Peter cried after you, desperation in his voice.\u00a0<br></p><p>You turned around before you got out the door, eyes narrowed,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve, for fuck\u2019s sake. I\u2019m going home to be with my family. I\u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m going to be happy instead of scared,\u201d you suppressed a sigh of irritation, eyes burning with tears once again.\u00a0\u201cAll the damn time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just run away!\u201d His eyes were wide and fearful, hands begging to reach out and grasp for you with the force of a scared child.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut here I am, running away,\u201d you turned away and wrapped your hand on the doorknob,\u00a0\u201cFrom you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You didn\u2019t stick around to see if he chased after you, but you never ran down the hall as quick as you did in that moment. The elevator was too slow, so you took the stairs, chest heaving, lungs screaming. You couldn\u2019t shatter now. There was time to break later.\u00a0</p><p>When you got to the doubled doors at the exit of the building, you used your forearms to push open the door. But instead of the doors opening fully, you met with a barricade of snow. Some of it even managed to slip in through the crease of the door when you opened it slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Looking down through the glass window, you grumble in protest. A thick coat of stark white snow had climbed about halfway up the door. In that moment it was obvious; you were definitely trapped in this God forsaken building with no way out until the snow cleared up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you\u00a0<i>kidding\u00a0</i>me?\u201d You whined, forehead smacking onto the window of the door.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon! I don\u2019t wanna stay\u00a0<i>here</i>. I was winning the argument,\u201d you shoved the tip of your boot into the bottom part of the door repeatedly,\u00a0\u201cWhy, why, why, why, why\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c(Name), ah, are you\u2026 okay?\u201d A stertorous voice filled with heavy confusion brought you to slowly pick your head up from the window.\u00a0</p><p>Turning around, you came face to face with Peter. He was noticeably out of breath, hands clutching onto his abdomen, face twisted in ailment. The turmoil was eating away at his insides as he watched you practically fling yourself away from his presence like a madwoman. It only took him a few seconds to go after you, and when he heard your voice, distressed and hoarse, he ran the rest of the way to you. He was admittedly out of breath because of his injuries which made running ten times more hard work.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSnowed in\u2026\u201d you mumbled dejectedly, throwing a lazy thumb over your shoulder.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes followed to where you gestured to, eyes widening with shock before realization dawned on him. He exhaled, and loudly.\u00a0\u201cJesus Christ, (Name), I thought you were hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather would\u2019ve been,\u201d you huffed, turning back around to kick the door once more. You let out a high-pitched, strangled screech. \u201c<i>Stupid fucking door!</i>\u201d</p><p>Your words hurt, he couldn\u2019t deny it.\u00a0</p><p>Peter was a sensitive person, and when it came to you, it was like all his senses feened for your happiness. When you weren\u2019t happy, he felt every last bit of the emotion that was running around in your blood. It was all so\u00a0<i>very\u00a0</i>overwhelming.\u00a0</p><p>He cleared his throat, and you stopped. Slowly, you turned around to look at him with squinted eyes, prompting that you wanted to know what he wanted. He scratched the back of his neck and continued,\u00a0\u201cThe snow won\u2019t melt in a short period of time,\u201d he said, and you quirked an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just have Christmas here,\u201d you frowned.\u00a0\u201cWith me, I mean. Christmas with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>God, even as you looked at him like the most hated person on the planet, he still couldn\u2019t help but have no control over the roaring swarm of butterflies in his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>For a split second, your face softened, and that tender look glowed in your eyes again. It was one of his favorite looks. But before you could get too lost, the reality sunk back into your chest, and you gave him your best icy glare.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass, Bug Boy.\u201d With a forced huff, you plopped down on the ground, back pressed uncomfortably to the doubled doors.\u00a0<br></p><p>A sigh, then, \u201c(<i>Name</i>)\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m mad at you.\u201d You fidgeted with the hem of your turtleneck sweater, trying to force down the vulnerability he brought out of you with just a movement of his lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was always trying to prove to you just how brilliant you were, how much he trusted you, cared about you, craved to get closer\u2014 mentally if not physically\u2014 but they were all subtle hints, and you didn\u2019t\u00a0<i>understand\u00a0</i>him.\u00a0<br></p><p>He grumbled, feet scuffling along the ground, bringing him closer to you. With a huff, he plopped down next to you, thigh instantly touching yours, emitting an electrical shock from the proximity.\u00a0<br></p><p>You held your breath, not being able to look at him. Eyes screwed shut, breath coming out in short sporadic puffs, knees wobbly even as you sat down, heart daring to confess to the absolute admiration you had for him despite how angry you were.\u00a0<br></p><p>The Holy Trinity.\u00a0<br></p><p>Life was fucked up that way.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCan you be mad at me\u00a0<i>inside</i>?\u201d He nudged his shoulder to yours, his lips curving slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d</p><p>Still, you said nothing. Too busy trying to win a battle with your heart and force it silent. It was no use\u2014 no matter what you did, your heart would always beat for Peter. He was the sole purpose.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cC\u2019moooon. We can decorate, set up the Christmas tree\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a Christmas tree?\u201d You asked, eyes remaining focused elsewhere.\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiled and stared at you with a yearning so powerful that it was hard to ignore, but still, it became unbeknownst to you. \u201cThe tree you bought me that one Christmas,\u201d he reminisced.\u00a0<br></p><p>It was then your eyes flew up to lock with his, wide and shock-filled. \u201cPeter, that was like five years ago,\u201d he nodded, and your face softened with a sweet fondness. \u201cYou kept it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiled again, and you wondered what it was about his smile that made you want to pepper his face with kisses. In moments like these, it was then you truly realized that he was the epitome of all things bright and innocent.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go inside. I promise we will decorate until are hands are trembling and our minds are nothing but mush from the wine.\u201d He stood up, offering you an expectant hand, staring at you with pink cheeks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d You quirk an eyebrow. The thought of drinking with Peter sounded interesting, but you liked to talk when you were tipsy\u2014 that wasn\u2019t always a good thing. One minute you could be laughing, and then you could be confessing to your best friend that he is, ultimately, the love of your life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, and even though you knew he was joking around, there was some part of you that wanted him to further explain the consequences of this journey.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou are very pushy, you know that?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI like to think of it as optimistic.\u201d His reply was instant, the smile never left his face. He wiggled his fingers in a gesture for you to take his hand, and you bit your lip to prevent a grin from blooming across your face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d you slap your hand onto his, and his fingers immediately curl around your tinier ones, making a shiver crawl up your arms. \u201cBut no funny business, Parker.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you scolded in warning, looking up from the ground beneath you to catch the sight of his brown ones already staring at you, but then quickly looked away at the realization that he had been caught with the bonus of his hand still wrapped securely around yours.\u00a0<br></p><p>In that moment, you felt heat pool in your cheeks, while his were bright as a tomato.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, habit.\u201d He chuckled, dropping your hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>You instantly missed his warmth.\u00a0<br></p><p>Arriving at the door, he elbowed it open while facing you, afraid that if he turned his back to you for more than a second you would run away again.\u00a0<br></p><p>Guilt climbed up your chest, squeezing at your heart, causing you to give him the best assured expression you could muster. His face lit up in retaliation, that boyish charm resurfacing over his cherubic features.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d you said, the sweet timbre of your voice causing his heart to flutter, untamed and wild.\u00a0<br></p><p>He gave you a nod, albeit slow and hesitant, but your smile still broadened.\u00a0<br></p><p>You nodded behind him, and walked back into the room with grace, shedding your coat when you got to the foot of the coffee table that sat in the middle of the living area. The Christmas tree, that stood tall and stunning, was in the corner and how you managed to overlook it when you were last here, you had no clue.\u00a0No lights tangled around the Christmas tree, there was no Holiday setting besides the small and almost unnoticeable decorated picture frames. Some were of you and Peter being the ridiculous dorks that you were together, and some were of Mary Jane, or Miles, and even May and Ben from before he died.\u00a0</p><p>Warm merriment consumed you, and you inhaled contently through your nose. Glancing over at Peter, you noticed he was standing by a couple of boxes labeled\u00a0\u201cChristmas things\u201d. He stared back at you bashfully, his smile reflecting the stars that shined in your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d He lifted one from the floor and gestured to the tree behind you.\u00a0<br></p><p>You gave in, signing deeply before the two of you got into the groove of decorating the tree. Somewhere along the way, you took a break and got the wine bottle then poured yourself and Peter a glass of the red liquid. It was strong, but you didn\u2019t drink enough to get intoxicated. That was for another time, when your mind was still reeling with the possibility that something of utter important might slip if not careful, and fully sober enough to catch yourself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHand me the star.\u201d You spoke in contentment, the events from earlier not as important to stress about any further.\u00a0<br></p><p>Seconds later the star was slipped into your hand, suddenly overcome by a strong sensation when his fingers ghosted over your own. They weren\u2019t cold or too hot, they had been just the right amount of warm and the feeling delved deeper into your bones, your veins. There was a spark of something, and when it hand moved away, the warmth went with him.\u00a0</p><p>You hadn\u2019t been staring directly at him when the brief gesture happened, but when he pulled away as if something had burned into his skin, when you knew that he felt the same thing you did, it caught you completely off-guard. The action alone was enough to have your knees wobbling, and wavering.\u00a0</p><p>You gripped onto the latter, eyes wide as you steadied yourself.\u00a0\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre\u2014 Are you okay?\u201d His voice was small and raspy, filled with lethargy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you gripped the star in your hand, and reached upwards as you tried to set the ornament on the very tip of the already glowing tree. Being short had its disadvantages, and it proved even more so when your feet caught on a corner of the latter just as you were about to move onto the next higher step.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>In the blink of an eye, you had lost all sense of coordination and control of your footing. You held your breath as your body craned backwards, the inevitability of the events that played out for you on a loop, catching as you landed on something other than the ground below you.\u00a0</p><p><i>Humph</i>.</p><p>Arms instantly encompassed around your frame, holding you tightly. Peter\u2019s body shook once then he exhaled with a hiss, an undertone of relief dripping from his tongue. His arms tightened around you before,\u00a0\u201c(Name).\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You kept your eyes screwed shut, heart still beating erratically inside the cage you held it in.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d You whispered, voice hushed and attentive. Peter\u2019s proximity wasn\u2019t helping your case either, not when you could feel the warmth of his breath on your nose and cheekbones.\u00a0</p><p>A genuine laugh, then,\u00a0\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t have caught you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was suspecting\u2026\u201d You admitted, feeling a small grin of your own dance innocently across your lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>Silence crowded the space between you, but it took everything in you to keep your eyes closed for fear that you would encounter a more vulnerable side to Peter, the side that you were dreading of being close to.\u00a0</p><p>It was too late.\u00a0</p><p>You opened your eyes, peeking up at him through long lashes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c(<i>Name</i>)?\u201d He murmured, breathless with searching eyes. They were frantic as they moved across your face; anywhere from your lips to your eyes, to your nose and your cheeks. Oh boy.\u00a0</p><p>You hummed in reply, eyes never having the decency of moving anywhere but his own brown and captivating ones. They were like the leaves on a wilting tree branch, ready to grow again, blooming into something more warm and filled with that of nature.\u00a0</p><p>You could lose yourself in them.\u00a0</p><p>His head dipped, but he didn\u2019t get any closer than that. As if hesitance filled him, he pulled away the slightest and then awkwardly chuckled, pointing to the mistletoe above you.\u00a0</p><p>You followed the movement of his hand and instantly tried to fight back the heat that threatened to fill every inch of your body.

You didn\u2019t think the thought of setting you back down on your feet even crossed his mind, or it did, and he just refused to stop touching you.\u00a0</p><p>Either way, you weren\u2019t bothered by it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you put that there, Parker?\u201d You asked, voice laconic.\u00a0<br></p><p>Immediately, and just as his cheeks gained a noticeable red tint to them, he shook his head as if to save his dignity. With valiance, he took it as far as backing himself up verbally with a simple and apprehensive,\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With a tender hum, you quirked a brow and one corner of your lips turned upwards at his\u00a0<i>obvious\u00a0</i>lie. You could see right through him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you interlocked your fingers together as your forearms rested over the back of his neck.\u00a0\u201cAre you gonna kiss me or what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>And if that boy had any ounce of confidence in him, he used every last bit of it to lean down without a second\u2019s hesitation and gradually capture your lips with his.</p>",

Every part of you felt cold, but the heater ran perfectly. The snow outside was still falling, drizzling on the windowsill, the fire-escape, the railings. It was beautiful, but in this moment, you couldn\u2019t pull apart the beauty of it all. Not when your anger was solely focused on how heavy your heart felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2014 I had to g-go. (Name), please, you have to understand just how much\u2014\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to you, I get it.\u201d You snarled, tears welling up in your eyes. You wrapped your arms around your mid-section as your head lowered to avoid his crestfallen expression.\u00a0<br></p><p>You could just imagine how much regret was swimming around in his veins by the tone of his voice alone; the expression was nowhere half as exposing as his face was.\u00a0</p><p>A slow unpleasant hiss echoed throughout the room, and your eyes met his once again, unable to keep your prying and worried eyes off him. The cuts and bruises that littered his cheekbones, chin, forehead were all staring back at you as if they knew he was your ultimate weakness. As he held his torn red mask in his hand while the other gripped onto his shoulder blade that was, no doubt, bleeding, you wondered how long it would be before you finally gave up on him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou are damaged goods, Parker.\u201d You scolded, a pout lining the corners of your lips.<br></p><p>He almost chuckled at that, but his eyes were following the trails of your tears. When you were in pain something always fired off in his head; a warning of sorts. It was his body telling him that he needed to stop it, to fix it, to do something to prevent you from hurting.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you\u2026 please?\u201d He whispered, voice shaky.\u00a0\u201cHelp me, please.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d your mouth parted once, then closed quickly. You clenched your fists, then inhaled.\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t help you,\u201d you replied defiantly, uncrossing your arms to reach for your jacket that hung precariously over the couch.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d<br></p><p>As you slipped into your jacket, you walked to the door, heart daring to beat out of your chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re done?\u201d Peter cried after you, desperation in his voice.\u00a0<br></p><p>You turned around before you got out the door, eyes narrowed,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve, for fuck\u2019s sake. I\u2019m going home to be with my family. I\u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m going to be happy instead of scared,\u201d you suppressed a sigh of irritation, eyes burning with tears once again.\u00a0\u201cAll the damn time.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just run away!\u201d His eyes were wide and fearful, hands begging to reach out and grasp for you with the force of a scared child.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut here I am, running away,\u201d you turned away and wrapped your hand on the doorknob,\u00a0\u201cFrom you.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You didn\u2019t stick around to see if he chased after you, but you never ran down the hall as quick as you did in that moment. The elevator was too slow, so you took the stairs, chest heaving, lungs screaming. You couldn\u2019t shatter now. There was time to break later.\u00a0</p><p>When you got to the doubled doors at the exit of the building, you used your forearms to push open the door. But instead of the doors opening fully, you met with a barricade of snow. Some of it even managed to slip in through the crease of the door when you opened it slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Looking down through the glass window, you grumble in protest. A thick coat of stark white snow had climbed about halfway up the door. In that moment it was obvious; you were definitely trapped in this God forsaken building with no way out until the snow cleared up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you\u00a0<i>kidding\u00a0</i>me?\u201d You whined, forehead smacking onto the window of the door.\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon! I don\u2019t wanna stay\u00a0<i>here</i>. I was winning the argument,\u201d you shoved the tip of your boot into the bottom part of the door repeatedly,\u00a0\u201cWhy, why, why, why, why\u2014\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c(Name), ah, are you\u2026 okay?\u201d A stertorous voice filled with heavy confusion brought you to slowly pick your head up from the window.\u00a0</p><p>Turning around, you came face to face with Peter. He was noticeably out of breath, hands clutching onto his abdomen, face twisted in ailment. The turmoil was eating away at his insides as he watched you practically fling yourself away from his presence like a madwoman. It only took him a few seconds to go after you, and when he heard your voice, distressed and hoarse, he ran the rest of the way to you. He was admittedly out of breath because of his injuries which made running ten times more hard work.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSnowed in\u2026\u201d you mumbled dejectedly, throwing a lazy thumb over your shoulder.\u00a0<br></p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes followed to where you gestured to, eyes widening with shock before realization dawned on him. He exhaled, and loudly.\u00a0\u201cJesus Christ, (Name), I thought you were hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather would\u2019ve been,\u201d you huffed, turning back around to kick the door once more. You let out a high-pitched, strangled screech. \u201c<i>Stupid fucking door!</i>\u201d</p><p>Your words hurt, he couldn\u2019t deny it.\u00a0</p><p>Peter was a sensitive person, and when it came to you, it was like all his senses feened for your happiness. When you weren\u2019t happy, he felt every last bit of the emotion that was running around in your blood. It was all so\u00a0<i>very\u00a0</i>overwhelming.\u00a0</p><p>He cleared his throat, and you stopped. Slowly, you turned around to look at him with squinted eyes, prompting that you wanted to know what he wanted. He scratched the back of his neck and continued,\u00a0\u201cThe snow won\u2019t melt in a short period of time,\u201d he said, and you quirked an eyebrow.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just have Christmas here,\u201d you frowned.\u00a0\u201cWith me, I mean. Christmas with me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>God, even as you looked at him like the most hated person on the planet, he still couldn\u2019t help but have no control over the roaring swarm of butterflies in his stomach.\u00a0</p><p>For a split second, your face softened, and that tender look glowed in your eyes again. It was one of his favorite looks. But before you could get too lost, the reality sunk back into your chest, and you gave him your best icy glare.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass, Bug Boy.\u201d With a forced huff, you plopped down on the ground, back pressed uncomfortably to the doubled doors.\u00a0<br></p><p>A sigh, then, \u201c(<i>Name</i>)\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m mad at you.\u201d You fidgeted with the hem of your turtleneck sweater, trying to force down the vulnerability he brought out of you with just a movement of his lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>He was always trying to prove to you just how brilliant you were, how much he trusted you, cared about you, craved to get closer\u2014 mentally if not physically\u2014 but they were all subtle hints, and you didn\u2019t\u00a0<i>understand\u00a0</i>him.\u00a0<br></p><p>He grumbled, feet scuffling along the ground, bringing him closer to you. With a huff, he plopped down next to you, thigh instantly touching yours, emitting an electrical shock from the proximity.\u00a0<br></p><p>You held your breath, not being able to look at him. Eyes screwed shut, breath coming out in short sporadic puffs, knees wobbly even as you sat down, heart daring to confess to the absolute admiration you had for him despite how angry you were.\u00a0<br></p><p>The Holy Trinity.\u00a0<br></p><p>Life was fucked up that way.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCan you be mad at me\u00a0<i>inside</i>?\u201d He nudged his shoulder to yours, his lips curving slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d</p><p>Still, you said nothing. Too busy trying to win a battle with your heart and force it silent. It was no use\u2014 no matter what you did, your heart would always beat for Peter. He was the sole purpose.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cC\u2019moooon. We can decorate, set up the Christmas tree\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a Christmas tree?\u201d You asked, eyes remaining focused elsewhere.\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiled and stared at you with a yearning so powerful that it was hard to ignore, but still, it became unbeknownst to you. \u201cThe tree you bought me that one Christmas,\u201d he reminisced.\u00a0<br></p><p>It was then your eyes flew up to lock with his, wide and shock-filled. \u201cPeter, that was like five years ago,\u201d he nodded, and your face softened with a sweet fondness. \u201cYou kept it?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He smiled again, and you wondered what it was about his smile that made you want to pepper his face with kisses. In moments like these, it was then you truly realized that he was the epitome of all things bright and innocent.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go inside. I promise we will decorate until are hands are trembling and our minds are nothing but mush from the wine.\u201d He stood up, offering you an expectant hand, staring at you with pink cheeks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d You quirk an eyebrow. The thought of drinking with Peter sounded interesting, but you liked to talk when you were tipsy\u2014 that wasn\u2019t always a good thing. One minute you could be laughing, and then you could be confessing to your best friend that he is, ultimately, the love of your life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, and even though you knew he was joking around, there was some part of you that wanted him to further explain the consequences of this journey.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou are very pushy, you know that?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI like to think of it as optimistic.\u201d His reply was instant, the smile never left his face. He wiggled his fingers in a gesture for you to take his hand, and you bit your lip to prevent a grin from blooming across your face.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d you slap your hand onto his, and his fingers immediately curl around your tinier ones, making a shiver crawl up your arms. \u201cBut no funny business, Parker.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you scolded in warning, looking up from the ground beneath you to catch the sight of his brown ones already staring at you, but then quickly looked away at the realization that he had been caught with the bonus of his hand still wrapped securely around yours.\u00a0<br></p><p>In that moment, you felt heat pool in your cheeks, while his were bright as a tomato.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry, habit.\u201d He chuckled, dropping your hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>You instantly missed his warmth.\u00a0<br></p><p>Arriving at the door, he elbowed it open while facing you, afraid that if he turned his back to you for more than a second you would run away again.\u00a0<br></p><p>Guilt climbed up your chest, squeezing at your heart, causing you to give him the best assured expression you could muster. His face lit up in retaliation, that boyish charm resurfacing over his cherubic features.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d you said, the sweet timbre of your voice causing his heart to flutter, untamed and wild.\u00a0<br></p><p>He gave you a nod, albeit slow and hesitant, but your smile still broadened.\u00a0<br></p><p>You nodded behind him, and walked back into the room with grace, shedding your coat when you got to the foot of the coffee table that sat in the middle of the living area. The Christmas tree, that stood tall and stunning, was in the corner and how you managed to overlook it when you were last here, you had no clue.\u00a0No lights tangled around the Christmas tree, there was no Holiday setting besides the small and almost unnoticeable decorated picture frames. Some were of you and Peter being the ridiculous dorks that you were together, and some were of Mary Jane, or Miles, and even May and Ben from before he died.\u00a0</p><p>Warm merriment consumed you, and you inhaled contently through your nose. Glancing over at Peter, you noticed he was standing by a couple of boxes labeled\u00a0\u201cChristmas things\u201d. He stared back at you bashfully, his smile reflecting the stars that shined in your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d He lifted one from the floor and gestured to the tree behind you.\u00a0<br></p><p>You gave in, signing deeply before the two of you got into the groove of decorating the tree. Somewhere along the way, you took a break and got the wine bottle then poured yourself and Peter a glass of the red liquid. It was strong, but you didn\u2019t drink enough to get intoxicated. That was for another time, when your mind was still reeling with the possibility that something of utter important might slip if not careful, and fully sober enough to catch yourself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHand me the star.\u201d You spoke in contentment, the events from earlier not as important to stress about any further.\u00a0<br></p><p>Seconds later the star was slipped into your hand, suddenly overcome by a strong sensation when his fingers ghosted over your own. They weren\u2019t cold or too hot, they had been just the right amount of warm and the feeling delved deeper into your bones, your veins. There was a spark of something, and when it hand moved away, the warmth went with him.\u00a0</p><p>You hadn\u2019t been staring directly at him when the brief gesture happened, but when he pulled away as if something had burned into his skin, when you knew that he felt the same thing you did, it caught you completely off-guard. The action alone was enough to have your knees wobbling, and wavering.\u00a0</p><p>You gripped onto the latter, eyes wide as you steadied yourself.\u00a0\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre\u2014 Are you okay?\u201d His voice was small and raspy, filled with lethargy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you gripped the star in your hand, and reached upwards as you tried to set the ornament on the very tip of the already glowing tree. Being short had its disadvantages, and it proved even more so when your feet caught on a corner of the latter just as you were about to move onto the next higher step.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>In the blink of an eye, you had lost all sense of coordination and control of your footing. You held your breath as your body craned backwards, the inevitability of the events that played out for you on a loop, catching as you landed on something other than the ground below you.\u00a0</p><p><i>Humph</i>.</p><p>Arms instantly encompassed around your frame, holding you tightly. Peter\u2019s body shook once then he exhaled with a hiss, an undertone of relief dripping from his tongue. His arms tightened around you before,\u00a0\u201c(Name).\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You kept your eyes screwed shut, heart still beating erratically inside the cage you held it in.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d You whispered, voice hushed and attentive. Peter\u2019s proximity wasn\u2019t helping your case either, not when you could feel the warmth of his breath on your nose and cheekbones.\u00a0</p><p>A genuine laugh, then,\u00a0\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t have caught you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI was suspecting\u2026\u201d You admitted, feeling a small grin of your own dance innocently across your lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>Silence crowded the space between you, but it took everything in you to keep your eyes closed for fear that you would encounter a more vulnerable side to Peter, the side that you were dreading of being close to.\u00a0</p><p>It was too late.\u00a0</p><p>You opened your eyes, peeking up at him through long lashes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c(<i>Name</i>)?\u201d He murmured, breathless with searching eyes. They were frantic as they moved across your face; anywhere from your lips to your eyes, to your nose and your cheeks. Oh boy.\u00a0</p><p>You hummed in reply, eyes never having the decency of moving anywhere but his own brown and captivating ones. They were like the leaves on a wilting tree branch, ready to grow again, blooming into something more warm and filled with that of nature.\u00a0</p><p>You could lose yourself in them.\u00a0</p><p>His head dipped, but he didn\u2019t get any closer than that. As if hesitance filled him, he pulled away the slightest and then awkwardly chuckled, pointing to the mistletoe above you.\u00a0</p><p>You followed the movement of his hand and instantly tried to fight back the heat that threatened to fill every inch of your body. With a shy twitch of your mouth, your eyes flew down to meet those of the man who held you bridal style in his arms. You didn\u2019t think the thought of setting you back down on your feet even crossed his mind, or it did, and he just refused to stop touching you.\u00a0</p><p>Either way, you weren\u2019t bothered by it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you put that there, Parker?\u201d You asked, voice laconic.\u00a0<br></p><p>Immediately, and just as his cheeks gained a noticeable red tint to them, he shook his head as if to save his dignity. With valiance, he took it as far as backing himself up verbally with a simple and apprehensive,\u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With a tender hum, you quirked a brow and one corner of your lips turned upwards at his\u00a0<i>obvious\u00a0</i>lie. You could see right through him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d you interlocked your fingers together as your forearms rested over the back of his neck.\u00a0\u201cAre you gonna kiss me or what?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>And if that boy had any ounce of confidence in him, he used every last bit of it to lean down without a second\u2019s hesitation and gradually capture your lips with his.</p>",

You let out a high-pitched, strangled screech. &ldquo;<i>Stupid fucking door!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Your words hurt, he couldn&rsquo;t deny it.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter was a sensitive person, and when it came to you, it was like all his senses feened for your happiness. When you weren&rsquo;t happy, he felt every last bit of the emotion that was running around in your blood. It was all so&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>He cleared his throat, and you stopped. Slowly, you turned around to look at him with squinted eyes, prompting that you wanted to know what he wanted. He scratched the back of his neck and continued,&nbsp;&ldquo;The snow won&rsquo;t melt in a short period of time,&rdquo; he said, and you quirked an eyebrow.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just have Christmas here,&rdquo; you frowned.&nbsp;&ldquo;With me, I mean. Christmas with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>God, even as you looked at him like the most hated person on the planet, he still couldn&rsquo;t help but have no control over the roaring swarm of butterflies in his stomach.&nbsp;</p><p>For a split second, your face softened, and that tender look glowed in your eyes again. It was one of his favorite looks. But before you could get too lost, the reality sunk back into your chest, and you gave him your best icy glare.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll pass, Bug Boy.&rdquo; With a forced huff, you plopped down on the ground, back pressed uncomfortably to the doubled doors.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>A sigh, then, &ldquo;(<i>Name</i>)&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m mad at you.&rdquo; You fidgeted with the hem of your turtleneck sweater, trying to force down the vulnerability he brought out of you with just a movement of his lips.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He was always trying to prove to you just how brilliant you were, how much he trusted you, cared about you, craved to get closer&mdash; mentally if not physically&mdash; but they were all subtle hints, and you didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>understand&nbsp;</i>him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He grumbled, feet scuffling along the ground, bringing him closer to you. With a huff, he plopped down next to you, thigh instantly touching yours, emitting an electrical shock from the proximity.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You held your breath, not being able to look at him. Eyes screwed shut, breath coming out in short sporadic puffs, knees wobbly even as you sat down, heart daring to confess to the absolute admiration you had for him despite how angry you were.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The Holy Trinity.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Life was fucked up that way.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can you be mad at me&nbsp;<i>inside</i>?&rdquo; He nudged his shoulder to yours, his lips curving slightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s freezing out here.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, you said nothing. Too busy trying to win a battle with your heart and force it silent. It was no use&mdash; no matter what you did, your heart would always beat for Peter. He was the sole purpose.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;moooon. We can decorate, set up the Christmas tree&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have a Christmas tree?&rdquo; You asked, eyes remaining focused elsewhere.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He smiled and stared at you with a yearning so powerful that it was hard to ignore, but still, it became unbeknownst to you. &ldquo;The tree you bought me that one Christmas,&rdquo; he reminisced.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>It was then your eyes flew up to lock with his, wide and shock-filled. &ldquo;Peter, that was like five years ago,&rdquo; he nodded, and your face softened with a sweet fondness. &ldquo;You kept it?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He smiled again, and you wondered what it was about his smile that made you want to pepper his face with kisses. In moments like these, it was then you truly realized that he was the epitome of all things bright and innocent.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go inside. I promise we will decorate until are hands are trembling and our minds are nothing but mush from the wine.&rdquo; He stood up, offering you an expectant hand, staring at you with pink cheeks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wine?&rdquo; You quirk an eyebrow. The thought of drinking with Peter sounded interesting, but you liked to talk when you were tipsy&mdash; that wasn&rsquo;t always a good thing. One minute you could be laughing, and then you could be confessing to your best friend that he is, ultimately, the love of your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, and even though you knew he was joking around, there was some part of you that wanted him to further explain the consequences of this journey.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You are very pushy, you know that?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I like to think of it as optimistic.&rdquo; His reply was instant, the smile never left his face. He wiggled his fingers in a gesture for you to take his hand, and you bit your lip to prevent a grin from blooming across your face.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; you slap your hand onto his, and his fingers immediately curl around your tinier ones, making a shiver crawl up your arms. &ldquo;But no funny business, Parker.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; you scolded in warning, looking up from the ground beneath you to catch the sight of his brown ones already staring at you, but then quickly looked away at the realization that he had been caught with the bonus of his hand still wrapped securely around yours.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>In that moment, you felt heat pool in your cheeks, while his were bright as a tomato.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, habit.&rdquo; He chuckled, dropping your hand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You instantly missed his warmth.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Arriving at the door, he elbowed it open while facing you, afraid that if he turned his back to you for more than a second you would run away again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Guilt climbed up your chest, squeezing at your heart, causing you to give him the best assured expression you could muster. His face lit up in retaliation, that boyish charm resurfacing over his cherubic features.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere,&rdquo; you said, the sweet timbre of your voice causing his heart to flutter, untamed and wild.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He gave you a nod, albeit slow and hesitant, but your smile still broadened.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You nodded behind him, and walked back into the room with grace, shedding your coat when you got to the foot of the coffee table that sat in the middle of the living area. The Christmas tree, that stood tall and stunning, was in the corner and how you managed to overlook it when you were last here, you had no clue.&nbsp;No lights tangled around the Christmas tree, there was no Holiday setting besides the small and almost unnoticeable decorated picture frames. Some were of you and Peter being the ridiculous dorks that you were together, and some were of Mary Jane, or Miles, and even May and Ben from before he died.&nbsp;</p><p>Warm merriment consumed you, and you inhaled contently through your nose. Glancing over at Peter, you noticed he was standing by a couple of boxes labeled&nbsp;&ldquo;Christmas things&rdquo;. He stared back at you bashfully, his smile reflecting the stars that shined in your eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; He lifted one from the floor and gestured to the tree behind you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You gave in, signing deeply before the two of you got into the groove of decorating the tree. Somewhere along the way, you took a break and got the wine bottle then poured yourself and Peter a glass of the red liquid. It was strong, but you didn&rsquo;t drink enough to get intoxicated. That was for another time, when your mind was still reeling with the possibility that something of utter important might slip if not careful, and fully sober enough to catch yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hand me the star.&rdquo; You spoke in contentment, the events from earlier not as important to stress about any further.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Seconds later the star was slipped into your hand, suddenly overcome by a strong sensation when his fingers ghosted over your own. They weren&rsquo;t cold or too hot, they had been just the right amount of warm and the feeling delved deeper into your bones, your veins. There was a spark of something, and when it hand moved away, the warmth went with him.&nbsp;</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t been staring directly at him when the brief gesture happened, but when he pulled away as if something had burned into his skin, when you knew that he felt the same thing you did, it caught you completely off-guard. The action alone was enough to have your knees wobbling, and wavering.&nbsp;</p><p>You gripped onto the latter, eyes wide as you steadied yourself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Whoa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are&mdash; Are you okay?&rdquo; His voice was small and raspy, filled with lethargy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you gripped the star in your hand, and reached upwards as you tried to set the ornament on the very tip of the already glowing tree. Being short had its disadvantages, and it proved even more so when your feet caught on a corner of the latter just as you were about to move onto the next higher step.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>In the blink of an eye, you had lost all sense of coordination and control of your footing. You held your breath as your body craned backwards, the inevitability of the events that played out for you on a loop, catching as you landed on something other than the ground below you.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Humph</i>.</p><p>Arms instantly encompassed around your frame, holding you tightly. Peter&rsquo;s body shook once then he exhaled with a hiss, an undertone of relief dripping from his tongue. His arms tightened around you before,&nbsp;&ldquo;(Name).&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You kept your eyes screwed shut, heart still beating erratically inside the cage you held it in.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can open your eyes now.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; You whispered, voice hushed and attentive. Peter&rsquo;s proximity wasn&rsquo;t helping your case either, not when you could feel the warmth of his breath on your nose and cheekbones.&nbsp;</p><p>A genuine laugh, then,&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you think I wouldn&rsquo;t have caught you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I was suspecting&hellip;&rdquo; You admitted, feeling a small grin of your own dance innocently across your lips.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Silence crowded the space between you, but it took everything in you to keep your eyes closed for fear that you would encounter a more vulnerable side to Peter, the side that you were dreading of being close to.&nbsp;</p><p>It was too late.&nbsp;</p><p>You opened your eyes, peeking up at him through long lashes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;(<i>Name</i>)?&rdquo; He murmured, breathless with searching eyes. They were frantic as they moved across your face; anywhere from your lips to your eyes, to your nose and your cheeks. Oh boy.&nbsp;</p><p>You hummed in reply, eyes never having the decency of moving anywhere but his own brown and captivating ones. They were like the leaves on a wilting tree branch, ready to grow again, blooming into something more warm and filled with that of nature.&nbsp;</p><p>You could lose yourself in them.&nbsp;</p><p>His head dipped, but he didn&rsquo;t get any closer than that. As if hesitance filled him, he pulled away the slightest and then awkwardly chuckled, pointing to the mistletoe above you.&nbsp;</p><p>You followed the movement of his hand and instantly tried to fight back the heat that threatened to fill every inch of your body. With a shy twitch of your mouth, your eyes flew down to meet those of the man who held you bridal style in his arms. You didn&rsquo;t think the thought of setting you back down on your feet even crossed his mind, or it did, and he just refused to stop touching you.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, you weren&rsquo;t bothered by it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you put that there, Parker?&rdquo; You asked, voice laconic.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Immediately, and just as his cheeks gained a noticeable red tint to them, he shook his head as if to save his dignity. With valiance, he took it as far as backing himself up verbally with a simple and apprehensive,&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>With a tender hum, you quirked a brow and one corner of your lips turned upwards at his&nbsp;<i>obvious&nbsp;</i>lie. You could see right through him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you interlocked your fingers together as your forearms rested over the back of his neck.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you gonna kiss me or what?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>And if that boy had any ounce of confidence in him, he used every last bit of it to lean down without a second&rsquo;s hesitation and gradually capture your lips with his.</p>",
