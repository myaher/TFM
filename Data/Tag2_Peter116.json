Mr Harrington was off with the flu, so your weekly, after-school meeting had been cancelled, which gave you the chance to get some homework done before meeting with your new friend - But who are you kidding?</p><p>Your homework remained neatly tidied away in your schoolbag as you sat overlooking the city, Wednesday\u2019s sunset reaching its final stages as a faint orange hue created a perfect outline of Manhattan.</p><p>You had expected to be alone since it was hours until you were due to meet up with your partner. But, alas, there was Spider-Man, arriving only a few minutes after you.</p><p><i>\u201cFirefly, huh?\u201d </i>Your hooded companion mulled over your name choice as he paced back and forward behind you.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like it.\u201d You responded.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t produce fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither do fireflies.\u201d You said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cFair point.\u201d He nodded. \u201cSo, uh, what now? Where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>Before you could respond, you felt a chill course through your body as you shuddered. Your partner grabbed your arm.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that too?\u201d He cautiously asked. You nodded before a ruckus on the streets below caught both of your attention. The click of high heels.</p><p>\u201cDown there.\u201d The boy whispered, his finger outstretched toward the source of the noise.</p><p>A young woman in a thick duffle coat was running down the alleyway below you, the sound of her heels becoming irregular as she realised that she was not only being followed, but that she had reached a dead end. A group of rather large men slowly approached her, lead by a bald man in a muscle tee, with a moustache that could rival Hulk Hogan. A blonde man stuck to his side, clutching onto and rummaging through the contents of the woman\u2019s handbag. But\u2026</p><p><i>If they already had her purse, then why were they still pursuing her?</i></p><p>Oh no.</p><p>\u201cWe need to help her. Now.\u201d You rushed, scrambling to your feet as you stealthily began to descend the fire escape.</p><p>\u201cWoah, woah!\u201d Spider-Man grabbed you before you could move any further. \u201cWe need a plan of attack, we can\u2019t just jump in there without a game plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, any ideas? We don\u2019t have much time to devise something.\u201d You said, trying to hurry the boy.</p><p>\u201cAlright, um\u2026!\u201d He said as he fumbled over ideas in his head, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>You listened intently as the boy revealed his plan.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen that really old movie, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FwZ47uYTfEXs%3Ft%3D15s&amp;t=ZjU0YzhlMDJkNjQ0YTA0ODZmMTVmMDI1MTZkYzJjZTZhMGJhOGE0NCxqUXloZThTdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A3UDTGBlSjoEMJQ2F8jiHSg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fpeter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175390216736%2Fspider-man-firefly-chapter-five&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Phantom Menace</a>?\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv7ztlSCq1w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"/></figure><p>\u201cCome on now, no more running, doll.,\u201d One of the men taunted, \u201cNowhere for you to go!\u201d He added, earning a low chuckle from the group. The gang leader pulled out a knife as he stalked up to the woman.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re gonna have some fun, just as long as you keep that pretty mouth of yours shut.\u201d The bald man sneered, causing the woman to hyperventilate, suppressing a scream in fear of what they would do if she made a sound.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, fellas,\u201d Spider-Man said with an impressive amount of confidence as you stood on the edge of the fire escape directly above the action. You both jumped down, completely synchronised, landing in front of the men. \u201cNow, how about you leave that girl alone?\u201d He continued, which caused the group to snigger at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you heard him.\u201d You warned, your partner\u2019s bravery seeming to ignite the courage within you. You opened your hand, watching the veins under your skin change to a warm yellow, as the light danced down the inside of your arm before surfacing at the tips of your fingers. \u201cHe said, leave the girl alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you gonna do to stop us?\u201d The leader laughed, brandishing his buck knife in your direction.</p><p>\u201cHe had to ask, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Spider-Man laughed as he whispered into your ear, \u201cOkay, we got this.\u201d You nodded to him as the two of you split up, beginning your attack on the men who were advancing towards you.</p><p>As your companion began throwing punches, so did you, your body appearing to know exactly what to do at exactly the right time. Baldy began swinging his knife at you, but you were too quick. You knocked the knife out of his hand with a crescent kick, launching it into the air as it landed on the metal grating a few floors above you. Once he was disarmed, his actions seemed much more hesitant, adding to that his increasing fear of the luminescence that was still glowing under your skin.</p><p>Half of the group had disappeared now, your masked teammate scaring them off with his quick reflexes and super strength, the blonde man dropping the woman\u2019s purse in the process. Thanks to your own heightened strength, you were able to send baldy tearing into the ground, seemingly out cold. Spider-Man nodded at your achievement before turning his attention back to the goons in front of him.</p><p>You lifted the purse from the tarmac and looked over to the woman who was curled up on the ground, leaning against the wall in fear. You let the light dissipate from your hands before approaching her cautiously, lowering your voice to try and calm her. \u201cAre you okay, miss?\u201d You said gently, handing her purse back to her.</p><p>\u201cT-thank y-you.\u201d She stammered as you helped her to her feet. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, call me Firefly.\u201d You turned to the boy still in action, \u201cAnd that, is Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, like, superheroes or something?\u201d</p><p>That caught you off-guard.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 you know what? Yeah. Yeah, we are.\u201d You smiled underneath your scarf at the sound of that title.</p><p><i>Superhero</i>.</p><p>The woman thanked you again before swiftly leaving the alleyway and running down the street, only half-shaken by what had just occurred.</p><p>As soon as you were sure that the lady had left safely, you turned around to find that Spider-Man had already taken down the three remaining goons and was tying them to some nearby grating by their shoelaces. You went over to help him when he turned and began looking around frantically.</p><p>\u201cWait. Where\u2019s Baldy?\u201d He asked in a worried tone. You cursed under your breath when you noticed that the man had, indeed, vanished. But a glint of light above you caught your attention.</p><p>Looking upward, you spotted the man ascending the fire escape towards the item that caught the light of the moon.</p><p>The knife.</p><p>\u201cI got him, you stay here.\u201d The boy shouted as he began scaling the wall in order to catch up with the man who was running up the metal stairs to retrieve his only weapon. You continued tying the rest up as Spider-Man wrestled with the man on the tiny balcony, his reflexes going into overdrive as he twisted himself out of the direction of the erratic swinging of the knife.</p><p>Your body shivered as the all too common feeling returned, coupled with a desperate and breathy shout for help. You looked up towards the two males battling it out above you to see your companion now dangling from the railings, Baldy closing in, giving him one final push before sending him hurtling towards the concrete below.</p><p>In an instant, everything went into slow motion and before you knew it, you jumped, throwing yourself towards the boy and catching him in your arms without questioning how you were doing it. You could feel a rush of wind in your face, and your companion arms that were tightly wrapped around you.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I got you.\u201d You comforted the boy who was apparently in shock. Spider-Man turned his head around to you, and then to the ground. Before you could ask him why he was acting strange, he suddenly let out a loud breath.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! You can <i>fly</i>?\u201d He chortled, his voice exhibiting an array of emotions, mainly hysteria and disbelief.</p><p>Your blood ran cold as you looked down. Your eyes widened as you realised that you were, indeed, hovering about ten feet off the ground. Not only that, but your entire lower body was engulfed in a mass of yellow mist, enveloped in a warm light.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, I guess I can?\u201d You confirmed, your grip on the boy tightening as you lowered the two of you to the ground. Your heart was beating so rapidly that you feared you would pass out. Was this fear? Nerves?</p><p>No.</p><p>No, this was exhilaration.</p><p>\u201cThat is so cool!\u201d Your partner acclaimed as you landed, the mist disappearing as you stumbled a little, finding your balance again. Spider-Man grabbed your shoulders, supporting you as he held you close. His breathing slowed down, suddenly making you aware of your close proximity, and how <i>familiar</i> it seemed.</p><p>Once Baldy was reunited with his friends on the ground, his wrists tightly wrapped around the railings beside them, you took your phone out to call the police and gave your location, hanging up before they could ask who you were. \u201cCops are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo! That\u2019s what you get when you mess with Spider-Man and Firefly!\u201d Your partner taunted excitedly, practically skipping around which didn\u2019t help his attempt at a \u2018tough demeanour\u2019,</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Baldy grunted.</p><p>You crouched to the level of the criminals in front of you. \u201cUs. Me and him. We\u2019re Spider-Man and Firefly. Tell your friends. Get used to the name. Because as long as there are people like you out there, we will be there to stop you.\u201d You spoke proudly, which encouraged a \u201c<i>Hell</i> <i>yeah</i> <i>we will!</i>\u201d from your intrepid comrade.</p><p>The two of you linked arms as you left the scene, a smile plastered on your face, albeit hidden by your disguise. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you can fly!\u201d The boy exclaimed</p><p>\u201cNeither can I. That\u2019s\u2026gonna take some getting used to.\u201d You muttered, knowing that your night had only just begun. \u201cShe called us superheroes, by the way. The lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Superheroes</i>, huh?\u201d Spider-Man laughed awkwardly. \u201cIt has a nice ring to it, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt definitely does.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"57\" data-orig-width=\"1078\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70fc3f0402d01c64482e6d5051197666/tumblr_inline_pnv8102Xpx1w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"57\" data-orig-width=\"1078\"/></figure><h2><a href=\"https://peter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com/post/176181977506/spider-man-firefly-chapter-six\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Next Chapter</i></b></a><b> (not rewritten yet)</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv815f7f21w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"/></figure><h2><b>Thanks for reading!</b></h2><p>If you enjoyed this chapter please consider reblogging it to share it with your friends!

Mr Harrington was off with the flu, so your weekly, after-school meeting had been cancelled, which gave you the chance to get some homework done before meeting with your new friend - But who are you kidding?</p><p>Your homework remained neatly tidied away in your schoolbag as you sat overlooking the city, Wednesday\u2019s sunset reaching its final stages as a faint orange hue created a perfect outline of Manhattan.</p><p>You had expected to be alone since it was hours until you were due to meet up with your partner. But, alas, there was Spider-Man, arriving only a few minutes after you.</p><p><i>\u201cFirefly, huh?\u201d </i>Your hooded companion mulled over your name choice as he paced back and forward behind you.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like it.\u201d You responded.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t produce fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither do fireflies.\u201d You said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cFair point.\u201d He nodded. \u201cSo, uh, what now? Where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>Before you could respond, you felt a chill course through your body as you shuddered. Your partner grabbed your arm.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that too?\u201d He cautiously asked. You nodded before a ruckus on the streets below caught both of your attention. The click of high heels.</p><p>\u201cDown there.\u201d The boy whispered, his finger outstretched toward the source of the noise.</p><p>A young woman in a thick duffle coat was running down the alleyway below you, the sound of her heels becoming irregular as she realised that she was not only being followed, but that she had reached a dead end. A group of rather large men slowly approached her, lead by a bald man in a muscle tee, with a moustache that could rival Hulk Hogan. A blonde man stuck to his side, clutching onto and rummaging through the contents of the woman\u2019s handbag. But\u2026</p><p><i>If they already had her purse, then why were they still pursuing her?</i></p><p>Oh no.</p><p>\u201cWe need to help her. Now.\u201d You rushed, scrambling to your feet as you stealthily began to descend the fire escape.</p><p>\u201cWoah, woah!\u201d Spider-Man grabbed you before you could move any further. \u201cWe need a plan of attack, we can\u2019t just jump in there without a game plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, any ideas? We don\u2019t have much time to devise something.\u201d You said, trying to hurry the boy.</p><p>\u201cAlright, um\u2026!\u201d He said as he fumbled over ideas in his head, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>You listened intently as the boy revealed his plan.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen that really old movie, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FwZ47uYTfEXs%3Ft%3D15s&amp;t=ZjU0YzhlMDJkNjQ0YTA0ODZmMTVmMDI1MTZkYzJjZTZhMGJhOGE0NCxqUXloZThTdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A3UDTGBlSjoEMJQ2F8jiHSg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fpeter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175390216736%2Fspider-man-firefly-chapter-five&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Phantom Menace</a>?\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv7ztlSCq1w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"></figure><p>\u201cCome on now, no more running, doll.,\u201d One of the men taunted, \u201cNowhere for you to go!\u201d He added, earning a low chuckle from the group. The gang leader pulled out a knife as he stalked up to the woman.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re gonna have some fun, just as long as you keep that pretty mouth of yours shut.\u201d The bald man sneered, causing the woman to hyperventilate, suppressing a scream in fear of what they would do if she made a sound.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, fellas,\u201d Spider-Man said with an impressive amount of confidence as you stood on the edge of the fire escape directly above the action. You both jumped down, completely synchronised, landing in front of the men. \u201cNow, how about you leave that girl alone?\u201d He continued, which caused the group to snigger at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you heard him.\u201d You warned, your partner\u2019s bravery seeming to ignite the courage within you. You opened your hand, watching the veins under your skin change to a warm yellow, as the light danced down the inside of your arm before surfacing at the tips of your fingers. \u201cHe said, leave the girl alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you gonna do to stop us?\u201d The leader laughed, brandishing his buck knife in your direction.</p><p>\u201cHe had to ask, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Spider-Man laughed as he whispered into your ear, \u201cOkay, we got this.\u201d You nodded to him as the two of you split up, beginning your attack on the men who were advancing towards you.</p><p>As your companion began throwing punches, so did you, your body appearing to know exactly what to do at exactly the right time. Baldy began swinging his knife at you, but you were too quick. You knocked the knife out of his hand with a crescent kick, launching it into the air as it landed on the metal grating a few floors above you. Once he was disarmed, his actions seemed much more hesitant, adding to that his increasing fear of the luminescence that was still glowing under your skin.</p><p>Half of the group had disappeared now, your masked teammate scaring them off with his quick reflexes and super strength, the blonde man dropping the woman\u2019s purse in the process. Thanks to your own heightened strength, you were able to send baldy tearing into the ground, seemingly out cold. Spider-Man nodded at your achievement before turning his attention back to the goons in front of him.</p><p>You lifted the purse from the tarmac and looked over to the woman who was curled up on the ground, leaning against the wall in fear. You let the light dissipate from your hands before approaching her cautiously, lowering your voice to try and calm her. \u201cAre you okay, miss?\u201d You said gently, handing her purse back to her.</p><p>\u201cT-thank y-you.\u201d She stammered as you helped her to her feet. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, call me Firefly.\u201d You turned to the boy still in action, \u201cAnd that, is Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, like, superheroes or something?\u201d</p><p>That caught you off-guard.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 you know what? Yeah. Yeah, we are.\u201d You smiled underneath your scarf at the sound of that title.</p><p><i>Superhero</i>.</p><p>The woman thanked you again before swiftly leaving the alleyway and running down the street, only half-shaken by what had just occurred.</p><p>As soon as you were sure that the lady had left safely, you turned around to find that Spider-Man had already taken down the three remaining goons and was tying them to some nearby grating by their shoelaces. You went over to help him when he turned and began looking around frantically.</p><p>\u201cWait. Where\u2019s Baldy?\u201d He asked in a worried tone. You cursed under your breath when you noticed that the man had, indeed, vanished. But a glint of light above you caught your attention.</p><p>Looking upward, you spotted the man ascending the fire escape towards the item that caught the light of the moon.</p><p>The knife.</p><p>\u201cI got him, you stay here.\u201d The boy shouted as he began scaling the wall in order to catch up with the man who was running up the metal stairs to retrieve his only weapon. You continued tying the rest up as Spider-Man wrestled with the man on the tiny balcony, his reflexes going into overdrive as he twisted himself out of the direction of the erratic swinging of the knife.</p><p>Your body shivered as the all too common feeling returned, coupled with a desperate and breathy shout for help. You looked up towards the two males battling it out above you to see your companion now dangling from the railings, Baldy closing in, giving him one final push before sending him hurtling towards the concrete below.</p><p>In an instant, everything went into slow motion and before you knew it, you jumped, throwing yourself towards the boy and catching him in your arms without questioning how you were doing it. You could feel a rush of wind in your face, and your companion arms that were tightly wrapped around you.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I got you.\u201d You comforted the boy who was apparently in shock. Spider-Man turned his head around to you, and then to the ground. Before you could ask him why he was acting strange, he suddenly let out a loud breath.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! You can <i>fly</i>?\u201d He chortled, his voice exhibiting an array of emotions, mainly hysteria and disbelief.</p><p>Your blood ran cold as you looked down. Your eyes widened as you realised that you were, indeed, hovering about ten feet off the ground. Not only that, but your entire lower body was engulfed in a mass of yellow mist, enveloped in a warm light.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, I guess I can?\u201d You confirmed, your grip on the boy tightening as you lowered the two of you to the ground. Your heart was beating so rapidly that you feared you would pass out. Was this fear? Nerves?</p><p>No.</p><p>No, this was exhilaration.</p><p>\u201cThat is so cool!\u201d Your partner acclaimed as you landed, the mist disappearing as you stumbled a little, finding your balance again. Spider-Man grabbed your shoulders, supporting you as he held you close. His breathing slowed down, suddenly making you aware of your close proximity, and how <i>familiar</i> it seemed.</p><p>Once Baldy was reunited with his friends on the ground, his wrists tightly wrapped around the railings beside them, you took your phone out to call the police and gave your location, hanging up before they could ask who you were. \u201cCops are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo! That\u2019s what you get when you mess with Spider-Man and Firefly!\u201d Your partner taunted excitedly, practically skipping around which didn\u2019t help his attempt at a \u2018tough demeanour\u2019,</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Baldy grunted.</p><p>You crouched to the level of the criminals in front of you. \u201cUs. Me and him. We\u2019re Spider-Man and Firefly. Tell your friends. Get used to the name. Because as long as there are people like you out there, we will be there to stop you.\u201d You spoke proudly, which encouraged a \u201c<i>Hell</i> <i>yeah</i> <i>we will!</i>\u201d from your intrepid comrade.</p><p>The two of you linked arms as you left the scene, a smile plastered on your face, albeit hidden by your disguise. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you can fly!\u201d The boy exclaimed</p><p>\u201cNeither can I. That\u2019s\u2026gonna take some getting used to.\u201d You muttered, knowing that your night had only just begun. \u201cShe called us superheroes, by the way. The lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Superheroes</i>, huh?\u201d Spider-Man laughed awkwardly. \u201cIt has a nice ring to it, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt definitely does.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"57\" data-orig-width=\"1078\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70fc3f0402d01c64482e6d5051197666/tumblr_inline_pnv8102Xpx1w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"57\" data-orig-width=\"1078\"></figure><h2><a href=\"https://peter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com/post/176181977506/spider-man-firefly-chapter-six\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Next Chapter</i></b></a><b> (not rewritten yet)</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv815f7f21w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"></figure><h2><b>Thanks for reading!</b></h2><p>If you enjoyed this chapter please consider reblogging it to share it with your friends!

Mr Harrington was off with the flu, so your weekly, after-school meeting had been cancelled, which gave you the chance to get some homework done before meeting with your new friend - But who are you kidding?</p><p>Your homework remained neatly tidied away in your schoolbag as you sat overlooking the city, Wednesday\u2019s sunset reaching its final stages as a faint orange hue created a perfect outline of Manhattan.</p><p>You had expected to be alone since it was hours until you were due to meet up with your partner. But, alas, there was Spider-Man, arriving only a few minutes after you.</p><p><i>\u201cFirefly, huh?\u201d </i>Your hooded companion mulled over your name choice as he paced back and forward behind you.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like it.\u201d You responded.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t produce fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither do fireflies.\u201d You said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cFair point.\u201d He nodded. \u201cSo, uh, what now? Where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>Before you could respond, you felt a chill course through your body as you shuddered. Your partner grabbed your arm.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that too?\u201d He cautiously asked. You nodded before a ruckus on the streets below caught both of your attention. The click of high heels.</p><p>\u201cDown there.\u201d The boy whispered, his finger outstretched toward the source of the noise.</p><p>A young woman in a thick duffle coat was running down the alleyway below you, the sound of her heels becoming irregular as she realised that she was not only being followed, but that she had reached a dead end. A group of rather large men slowly approached her, lead by a bald man in a muscle tee, with a moustache that could rival Hulk Hogan. A blonde man stuck to his side, clutching onto and rummaging through the contents of the woman\u2019s handbag. But\u2026</p><p><i>If they already had her purse, then why were they still pursuing her?</i></p><p>Oh no.</p><p>\u201cWe need to help her. Now.\u201d You rushed, scrambling to your feet as you stealthily began to descend the fire escape.</p><p>\u201cWoah, woah!\u201d Spider-Man grabbed you before you could move any further. \u201cWe need a plan of attack, we can\u2019t just jump in there without a game plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, any ideas? We don\u2019t have much time to devise something.\u201d You said, trying to hurry the boy.</p><p>\u201cAlright, um\u2026!\u201d He said as he fumbled over ideas in his head, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>You listened intently as the boy revealed his plan.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen that really old movie, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FwZ47uYTfEXs%3Ft%3D15s&amp;t=ZjU0YzhlMDJkNjQ0YTA0ODZmMTVmMDI1MTZkYzJjZTZhMGJhOGE0NCxqUXloZThTdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A3UDTGBlSjoEMJQ2F8jiHSg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fpeter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175390216736%2Fspider-man-firefly-chapter-five&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Phantom Menace</a>?\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv7ztlSCq1w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"></figure><p>\u201cCome on now, no more running, doll.,\u201d One of the men taunted, \u201cNowhere for you to go!\u201d He added, earning a low chuckle from the group. The gang leader pulled out a knife as he stalked up to the woman.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re gonna have some fun, just as long as you keep that pretty mouth of yours shut.\u201d The bald man sneered, causing the woman to hyperventilate, suppressing a scream in fear of what they would do if she made a sound.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, fellas,\u201d Spider-Man said with an impressive amount of confidence as you stood on the edge of the fire escape directly above the action. You both jumped down, completely synchronised, landing in front of the men. \u201cNow, how about you leave that girl alone?\u201d He continued, which caused the group to snigger at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you heard him.\u201d You warned, your partner\u2019s bravery seeming to ignite the courage within you. You opened your hand, watching the veins under your skin change to a warm yellow, as the light danced down the inside of your arm before surfacing at the tips of your fingers. \u201cHe said, leave the girl alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you gonna do to stop us?\u201d The leader laughed, brandishing his buck knife in your direction.</p><p>\u201cHe had to ask, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Spider-Man laughed as he whispered into your ear, \u201cOkay, we got this.\u201d You nodded to him as the two of you split up, beginning your attack on the men who were advancing towards you.</p><p>As your companion began throwing punches, so did you, your body appearing to know exactly what to do at exactly the right time. Baldy began swinging his knife at you, but you were too quick. You knocked the knife out of his hand with a crescent kick, launching it into the air as it landed on the metal grating a few floors above you. Once he was disarmed, his actions seemed much more hesitant, adding to that his increasing fear of the luminescence that was still glowing under your skin.</p><p>Half of the group had disappeared now, your masked teammate scaring them off with his quick reflexes and super strength, the blonde man dropping the woman\u2019s purse in the process. Thanks to your own heightened strength, you were able to send baldy tearing into the ground, seemingly out cold. Spider-Man nodded at your achievement before turning his attention back to the goons in front of him.</p><p>You lifted the purse from the tarmac and looked over to the woman who was curled up on the ground, leaning against the wall in fear. You let the light dissipate from your hands before approaching her cautiously, lowering your voice to try and calm her. \u201cAre you okay, miss?\u201d You said gently, handing her purse back to her.</p><p>\u201cT-thank y-you.\u201d She stammered as you helped her to her feet. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, call me Firefly.\u201d You turned to the boy still in action, \u201cAnd that, is Spider-Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, like, superheroes or something?\u201d</p><p>That caught you off-guard.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 you know what? Yeah. Yeah, we are.\u201d You smiled underneath your scarf at the sound of that title.</p><p><i>Superhero</i>.</p><p>The woman thanked you again before swiftly leaving the alleyway and running down the street, only half-shaken by what had just occurred.</p><p>As soon as you were sure that the lady had left safely, you turned around to find that Spider-Man had already taken down the three remaining goons and was tying them to some nearby grating by their shoelaces. You went over to help him when he turned and began looking around frantically.</p><p>\u201cWait. Where\u2019s Baldy?\u201d He asked in a worried tone. You cursed under your breath when you noticed that the man had, indeed, vanished. But a glint of light above you caught your attention.</p><p>Looking upward, you spotted the man ascending the fire escape towards the item that caught the light of the moon.</p><p>The knife.</p><p>\u201cI got him, you stay here.\u201d The boy shouted as he began scaling the wall in order to catch up with the man who was running up the metal stairs to retrieve his only weapon. You continued tying the rest up as Spider-Man wrestled with the man on the tiny balcony, his reflexes going into overdrive as he twisted himself out of the direction of the erratic swinging of the knife.</p><p>Your body shivered as the all too common feeling returned, coupled with a desperate and breathy shout for help. You looked up towards the two males battling it out above you to see your companion now dangling from the railings, Baldy closing in, giving him one final push before sending him hurtling towards the concrete below.</p><p>In an instant, everything went into slow motion and before you knew it, you jumped, throwing yourself towards the boy and catching him in your arms without questioning how you were doing it. You could feel a rush of wind in your face, and your companion arms that were tightly wrapped around you.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. I got you.\u201d You comforted the boy who was apparently in shock. Spider-Man turned his head around to you, and then to the ground. Before you could ask him why he was acting strange, he suddenly let out a loud breath.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! You can <i>fly</i>?\u201d He chortled, his voice exhibiting an array of emotions, mainly hysteria and disbelief.</p><p>Your blood ran cold as you looked down. Your eyes widened as you realised that you were, indeed, hovering about ten feet off the ground. Not only that, but your entire lower body was engulfed in a mass of yellow mist, enveloped in a warm light.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, I guess I can?\u201d You confirmed, your grip on the boy tightening as you lowered the two of you to the ground. Your heart was beating so rapidly that you feared you would pass out. Was this fear? Nerves?</p><p>No.</p><p>No, this was exhilaration.</p><p>\u201cThat is so cool!\u201d Your partner acclaimed as you landed, the mist disappearing as you stumbled a little, finding your balance again. Spider-Man grabbed your shoulders, supporting you as he held you close. His breathing slowed down, suddenly making you aware of your close proximity, and how <i>familiar</i> it seemed.</p><p>Once Baldy was reunited with his friends on the ground, his wrists tightly wrapped around the railings beside them, you took your phone out to call the police and gave your location, hanging up before they could ask who you were. \u201cCops are on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo! That\u2019s what you get when you mess with Spider-Man and Firefly!\u201d Your partner taunted excitedly, practically skipping around which didn\u2019t help his attempt at a \u2018tough demeanour\u2019,</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Baldy grunted.</p><p>You crouched to the level of the criminals in front of you. \u201cUs. Me and him. We\u2019re Spider-Man and Firefly. Tell your friends. Get used to the name. Because as long as there are people like you out there, we will be there to stop you.\u201d You spoke proudly, which encouraged a \u201c<i>Hell</i> <i>yeah</i> <i>we will!</i>\u201d from your intrepid comrade.</p><p>The two of you linked arms as you left the scene, a smile plastered on your face, albeit hidden by your disguise. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you can fly!\u201d The boy exclaimed</p><p>\u201cNeither can I. That\u2019s\u2026gonna take some getting used to.\u201d You muttered, knowing that your night had only just begun. \u201cShe called us superheroes, by the way. The lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Superheroes</i>, huh?\u201d Spider-Man laughed awkwardly. \u201cIt has a nice ring to it, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt definitely does.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"57\" data-orig-width=\"1078\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70fc3f0402d01c64482e6d5051197666/tumblr_inline_pnv8102Xpx1w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"57\" data-orig-width=\"1078\"></figure><h2><a href=\"https://peter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com/post/176181977506/spider-man-firefly-chapter-six\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Next Chapter</i></b></a><b> (not rewritten yet)</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv815f7f21w4i27p_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"144\" data-orig-width=\"1440\"></figure><h2><b>Thanks for reading!</b></h2><p>If you enjoyed this chapter please consider reblogging it to share it with your friends!

Mr Harrington was off with the flu, so your weekly, after-school meeting had been cancelled, which gave you the chance to get some homework done before meeting with your new friend - But who are you kidding?</p><p>Your homework remained neatly tidied away in your schoolbag as you sat overlooking the city, Wednesday&rsquo;s sunset reaching its final stages as a faint orange hue created a perfect outline of Manhattan.</p><p>You had expected to be alone since it was hours until you were due to meet up with your partner. But, alas, there was Spider-Man, arriving only a few minutes after you.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Firefly, huh?&rdquo; </i>Your hooded companion mulled over your name choice as he paced back and forward behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I like it.&rdquo; You responded.</p><p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t produce fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, neither do fireflies.&rdquo; You said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>&ldquo;Fair point.&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;So, uh, what now? Where do we go from here?&rdquo;</p><p>Before you could respond, you felt a chill course through your body as you shuddered. Your partner grabbed your arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you feel that too?&rdquo; He cautiously asked. You nodded before a ruckus on the streets below caught both of your attention. The click of high heels.</p><p>&ldquo;Down there.&rdquo; The boy whispered, his finger outstretched toward the source of the noise.</p><p>A young woman in a thick duffle coat was running down the alleyway below you, the sound of her heels becoming irregular as she realised that she was not only being followed, but that she had reached a dead end. A group of rather large men slowly approached her, lead by a bald man in a muscle tee, with a moustache that could rival Hulk Hogan. A blonde man stuck to his side, clutching onto and rummaging through the contents of the woman&rsquo;s handbag. But&hellip;</p><p><i>If they already had her purse, then why were they still pursuing her?</i></p><p>Oh no.</p><p>&ldquo;We need to help her. Now.&rdquo; You rushed, scrambling to your feet as you stealthily began to descend the fire escape.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, woah!&rdquo; Spider-Man grabbed you before you could move any further. &ldquo;We need a plan of attack, we can&rsquo;t just jump in there without a game plan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, any ideas? We don&rsquo;t have much time to devise something.&rdquo; You said, trying to hurry the boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, um&hellip;!&rdquo; He said as he fumbled over ideas in his head, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>You listened intently as the boy revealed his plan.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen that really old movie, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FwZ47uYTfEXs%3Ft%3D15s&amp;t=ZjU0YzhlMDJkNjQ0YTA0ODZmMTVmMDI1MTZkYzJjZTZhMGJhOGE0NCxqUXloZThTdQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A3UDTGBlSjoEMJQ2F8jiHSg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fpeter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175390216736%2Fspider-man-firefly-chapter-five&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Phantom Menace</a>?&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv7ztlSCq1w4i27p_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Come on now, no more running, doll.,&rdquo; One of the men taunted, &ldquo;Nowhere for you to go!&rdquo; He added, earning a low chuckle from the group. The gang leader pulled out a knife as he stalked up to the woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re gonna have some fun, just as long as you keep that pretty mouth of yours shut.&rdquo; The bald man sneered, causing the woman to hyperventilate, suppressing a scream in fear of what they would do if she made a sound.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen, fellas,&rdquo; Spider-Man said with an impressive amount of confidence as you stood on the edge of the fire escape directly above the action. You both jumped down, completely synchronised, landing in front of the men. &ldquo;Now, how about you leave that girl alone?&rdquo; He continued, which caused the group to snigger at the two of you.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you heard him.&rdquo; You warned, your partner&rsquo;s bravery seeming to ignite the courage within you. You opened your hand, watching the veins under your skin change to a warm yellow, as the light danced down the inside of your arm before surfacing at the tips of your fingers. &ldquo;He said, leave the girl alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what are you gonna do to stop us?&rdquo; The leader laughed, brandishing his buck knife in your direction.</p><p>&ldquo;He had to ask, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Spider-Man laughed as he whispered into your ear, &ldquo;Okay, we got this.&rdquo; You nodded to him as the two of you split up, beginning your attack on the men who were advancing towards you.</p><p>As your companion began throwing punches, so did you, your body appearing to know exactly what to do at exactly the right time. Baldy began swinging his knife at you, but you were too quick. You knocked the knife out of his hand with a crescent kick, launching it into the air as it landed on the metal grating a few floors above you. Once he was disarmed, his actions seemed much more hesitant, adding to that his increasing fear of the luminescence that was still glowing under your skin.</p><p>Half of the group had disappeared now, your masked teammate scaring them off with his quick reflexes and super strength, the blonde man dropping the woman&rsquo;s purse in the process. Thanks to your own heightened strength, you were able to send baldy tearing into the ground, seemingly out cold. Spider-Man nodded at your achievement before turning his attention back to the goons in front of him.</p><p>You lifted the purse from the tarmac and looked over to the woman who was curled up on the ground, leaning against the wall in fear. You let the light dissipate from your hands before approaching her cautiously, lowering your voice to try and calm her. &ldquo;Are you okay, miss?&rdquo; You said gently, handing her purse back to her.</p><p>&ldquo;T-thank y-you.&rdquo; She stammered as you helped her to her feet. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, call me Firefly.&rdquo; You turned to the boy still in action, &ldquo;And that, is Spider-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you, like, superheroes or something?&rdquo;</p><p>That caught you off-guard.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip; you know what? Yeah. Yeah, we are.&rdquo; You smiled underneath your scarf at the sound of that title.</p><p><i>Superhero</i>.</p><p>The woman thanked you again before swiftly leaving the alleyway and running down the street, only half-shaken by what had just occurred.</p><p>As soon as you were sure that the lady had left safely, you turned around to find that Spider-Man had already taken down the three remaining goons and was tying them to some nearby grating by their shoelaces. You went over to help him when he turned and began looking around frantically.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait. Where&rsquo;s Baldy?&rdquo; He asked in a worried tone. You cursed under your breath when you noticed that the man had, indeed, vanished. But a glint of light above you caught your attention.</p><p>Looking upward, you spotted the man ascending the fire escape towards the item that caught the light of the moon.</p><p>The knife.</p><p>&ldquo;I got him, you stay here.&rdquo; The boy shouted as he began scaling the wall in order to catch up with the man who was running up the metal stairs to retrieve his only weapon. You continued tying the rest up as Spider-Man wrestled with the man on the tiny balcony, his reflexes going into overdrive as he twisted himself out of the direction of the erratic swinging of the knife.</p><p>Your body shivered as the all too common feeling returned, coupled with a desperate and breathy shout for help. You looked up towards the two males battling it out above you to see your companion now dangling from the railings, Baldy closing in, giving him one final push before sending him hurtling towards the concrete below.</p><p>In an instant, everything went into slow motion and before you knew it, you jumped, throwing yourself towards the boy and catching him in your arms without questioning how you were doing it. You could feel a rush of wind in your face, and your companion arms that were tightly wrapped around you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay. I got you.&rdquo; You comforted the boy who was apparently in shock. Spider-Man turned his head around to you, and then to the ground. Before you could ask him why he was acting strange, he suddenly let out a loud breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit! You can <i>fly</i>?&rdquo; He chortled, his voice exhibiting an array of emotions, mainly hysteria and disbelief.</p><p>Your blood ran cold as you looked down. Your eyes widened as you realised that you were, indeed, hovering about ten feet off the ground. Not only that, but your entire lower body was engulfed in a mass of yellow mist, enveloped in a warm light.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah, I guess I can?&rdquo; You confirmed, your grip on the boy tightening as you lowered the two of you to the ground. Your heart was beating so rapidly that you feared you would pass out. Was this fear? Nerves?</p><p>No.</p><p>No, this was exhilaration.</p><p>&ldquo;That is so cool!&rdquo; Your partner acclaimed as you landed, the mist disappearing as you stumbled a little, finding your balance again. Spider-Man grabbed your shoulders, supporting you as he held you close. His breathing slowed down, suddenly making you aware of your close proximity, and how <i>familiar</i> it seemed.</p><p>Once Baldy was reunited with his friends on the ground, his wrists tightly wrapped around the railings beside them, you took your phone out to call the police and gave your location, hanging up before they could ask who you were. &ldquo;Cops are on their way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yo! That&rsquo;s what you get when you mess with Spider-Man and Firefly!&rdquo; Your partner taunted excitedly, practically skipping around which didn&rsquo;t help his attempt at a &lsquo;tough demeanour&rsquo;,</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Baldy grunted.</p><p>You crouched to the level of the criminals in front of you. &ldquo;Us. Me and him. We&rsquo;re Spider-Man and Firefly. Tell your friends. Get used to the name. Because as long as there are people like you out there, we will be there to stop you.&rdquo; You spoke proudly, which encouraged a &ldquo;<i>Hell</i> <i>yeah</i> <i>we will!</i>&rdquo; from your intrepid comrade.</p><p>The two of you linked arms as you left the scene, a smile plastered on your face, albeit hidden by your disguise. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you can fly!&rdquo; The boy exclaimed</p><p>&ldquo;Neither can I. That&rsquo;s&hellip;gonna take some getting used to.&rdquo; You muttered, knowing that your night had only just begun. &ldquo;She called us superheroes, by the way. The lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Superheroes</i>, huh?&rdquo; Spider-Man laughed awkwardly. &ldquo;It has a nice ring to it, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It definitely does.&rdquo;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70fc3f0402d01c64482e6d5051197666/tumblr_inline_pnv8102Xpx1w4i27p_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><a href=\"https://peter-is-the-best-avenger.tumblr.com/post/176181977506/spider-man-firefly-chapter-six\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i>Next Chapter</i></b></a><b> (not rewritten yet)</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed86695299f0b4753f70b7af1784b98b/tumblr_inline_pnv815f7f21w4i27p_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2><b>Thanks for reading!</b></h2><p>If you enjoyed this chapter please consider reblogging it to share it with your friends!

The Tower is constantly kept at 72 degrees, unless it\u2019s summer, or unless it\u2019s someone\u2019s personal quarters. </p><p>The reason for this being is because if Peter gets too cold, his body starts shutting down to become dormant. Like a spider would do. And if the environment is below 23 degrees and Peter is without heat, his body begins making antifreeze to try to keep the spider part of him alive, but it begins to poison the human part of him.</p><p>So winter is a bit of a rough time for Peter and co. </p><p>Sometimes, Peter will also get into these trance like states, where he <i>has</i> to be in a corner, in the dark, away from everyone. </p><p>The first time he did that, it scared the living shit out of Sam.</p><p>And sometimes, when he goes into his trance like states, he gathers things into what can only be described as a nest. He finds object that are only the size of his palm, wraps them in webbing, and places them in said nest. </p><p>Honestly, the only sense they could make out of that one was that he was finding \u2018eggs\u2019 and protecting them. </p><p>It was oddly&hellip; Cute. </p><p><br/></p><p>Peter never remembers what he does when he wakes up from his trances. So Tony has to be sure that Karen is monitoring him at all times. Ned and MJ even have his number now in case he pulls some weird ass shit at school. </p>",

Tony schedules to have the day free of meetings and obligations a month\nbefore they even determine if Midtown is going, cause he\u2019s determined to be\nthere cheering Peter on. </p><p>The competing schools are already assembled when Tony gets\nthere at 1:30. He sees Midtown, swarming around in their gold jackets. He spots\nPeter instantly, like a magnetic pull. The kid has the camera Tony gave him\naround his neck, and he\u2019s smiling as he takes a picture of Ned and MJ messing\naround. </p><p>Tony watches him fondly for a second until people start\nnoticing him, which makes Peter notice him. Tony gives him a crooked smile and\na small wave and Peter carefully pulls away from his group of friends. </p><p>\u201cHey, Tony,\u201d he says as he walks up. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it, kiddo,\u201d Tony assures, following as Peter leads\nhim through the throng of students and parents. People stare as they pass, but\nTony ignores them, keeps a grounding hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder to remind him to\ndo the same. </p><p>Peter leads him to a seat towards the back of the\nauditorium, where Ned\u2019s and MJ\u2019s moms are. Tony smiles at them, remembering Ned\u2019s\nmom from May\u2019s funeral. </p><p>\u201cI saved a seat for you,\u201d Peter explains, gesturing to his\nragged backpack on one of the chairs.</p><p>\u201cThanks, bud,\u201d Tony says, just as a frazzled looking woman\nleans to speak into the microphone on the podium in the middle of the stage.</p><p>\u201cThe science portion of the quiz will begin in ten minutes.\nCompeting students should be backstage and checking in right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, crap,\u201d Peter exclaims, looking up and seeing MJ a few\nfeet away gesturing at him to come over. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201c Tony shoos him away. \u201cBreak a leg.\u201d</p><p>Peter shoots him another smile then hurries over to MJ, Ned\nlooking anxious over her shoulder.</p><p>MJ says something to him as Peter passes, pulling Ned along\nwith him by the arm. Then, Tony hears in a sudden lull in the noise level of\nthe auditorium, and Peter calls back, \u201cOh, hey, MJ, could you give my camera to\nmy dad?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth goes dry. He watches as Peter unslings the\nexpensive camera from around his neck and passes it to MJ before hurrying\nbackstage. Neither MJ nor Ned seemed surprised by Peter\u2019s word choice. </p><p>There are still nights when Tony replays Peter\u2019s voice in\nhis head, soft and muttered, as he said \u201cYou\u2019re a good dad.\u201d He holds onto it on\nbad days when he thinks he hurts more than he helps, when Peter trusts Maggie\nmore than him. But that hadn\u2019t been&hellip; possessive. Definitive.

She snaps another picture and Tony scowls\nat her. \u201cYou did it cause you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwitter tell you that, too?\u201d Tony asks coolly, ignoring the\nway his heart stutters at the nonchalant way she says it.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d MJ says, taking one more picture before lowering the\ncamera and looking directly at Tony for the first time. \u201cYou just did.\u201d </p><p>She tosses the camera at him and Tony catches it, his heart\nin his throat, afraid of damaging one of Peter\u2019s most prized possessions. </p><p>He wants to know what she means but doesn\u2019t want to ask. \u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot heart eyes for days, Stark,\u201d she says, shrugging in her bright gold jacket.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know he calls you his dad?\u201d</p><p>He really hates how observant this girl is. He changes the\nsubject.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a team to lead, Captain Jones?\u201d he asks with\na raised eyebrow. \u201cOr do you want to keep psychoanalyzing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I can\u2019t do both?\u201d She offers him a crooked grin\nthat he has a feeling he\u2019s privileged to see. \u201c\u2019Captain Jones,\u2019\u201d she muses as she\nstarts walking backwards toward the stage. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to take pictures,\u201d she calls over her\nshoulder. \u201cI want to see Flash\u2019s face when your son wins this for us.\u201d</p><p>Tony stares after her with he mouth open and his eyebrows\nfurrowed for a second, before shaking his head in exasperation.</p><p>He finally takes his seat on the end of the row. People seem\nto have finally lost interest in him, and Ned\u2019s mom is talking animatedly with\na man on the row in front of them, so Tony turns his attention to the camera.</p><p>The playback button is taunting him. </p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Tony turns the camera on and hits\nthe button, pulling up Peter\u2019s most recent pictures. The first one is, of\ncourse, one of the three that MJ had taken of him. </p><p>He\u2019s scowling down at her, the bad florescent lighting\nmaking the his face look paler and older than it should. He skips to the next\none, almost the same, but this time there\u2019s a fire in his eyes at the\ninsinuation that he adopted Peter for any other reason that it\u2019s <i>Peter </i>and Peter was <i>his kid</i> even before May died.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and moves on to the third. </p><p>He\u2019s staring away from the camera, his lips slightly parted\nin shock. There is adoration written into every line of his face, an open tenderness\nin his gaze that can only mean he\u2019s looking at Peter.</p><p>Tony swallows, looks subtly around him to make sure no one\u2019s\nwatching him. He looks back at the picture, his thumb hovering over the delete\nbutton. </p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome the Academic Decathlon\nregional finalists participating in the science quiz portion to the stage.\u201d</p><p>Tony jumps, looking up at the stage as kids start filing out\nand taking their seats. Peter\u2019s the seventh kid to walk out, his curls extra\nruffled like he\u2019s been running his hands through it in his nerves.</p><p>Tony hesitates for one more second before turning the camera\noff, the picture still sitting on the memory card. He claps for his kid,\ngrinning when Peter\u2019s eyes find him from the stage.</p><p><i>I love you</i>, he\nthinks again. And then, <i>kick their butts,\nkiddo</i>. </p><p>Peter does indeed win it for them, and Tony gets a close up\nof Flash\u2019s face as he sits sulking at the end of the table, having answered\nzero questions. He thinks he\u2019s going to get it framed for MJ. </p><p>After Midtown is awarded their trophy, they come rushing\nover to the section where the parents and teachers are sitting, cheering and\nwhooping as they come. Tony stands up and immediately envelops Peter in a hug,\nthe trophy that he\u2019s still carrying hitting Tony in the back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Pete,\u201d Tony calls over the sounds of\nhis teammates celebrating.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Someone calls, and he sees Ned\u2019s mom with Peter\u2019s\ncamera that Tony had left on his seat. \u201cLet me take a picture of you and your\ndad with the trophy!\u201d</p><p>And there was that word again, glowing and addictive, and\nPeter doesn\u2019t correct her, just turns in Tony\u2019s arms and holds up the trophy. </p><p>\u201c1, 2, 3,\u201d she counts, and the shutter clicks.</p><p>Tony\u2019s smile feels like it\u2019s going to split his face in two,\nhis heart repeating <i>my dad my dad </i>with\nevery beat.</p><p>\u201c1, 2, 3.\u201d </p><p>On the last count, Tony unabashedly turns his head and\nkisses Peter on the temple just as the camera flashes. </p><p>He takes the team out for dinner, the trophy in the seat of\nhonor at the end of the table, and Tony takes more pictures of Peter and his\nfriends and Peter takes pictures of everyone and everything.</p><p>Later, as he and Peter drive home, he sees Peter flicking\nthrough the pictures out of the corner of his eye. </p><p>When Peter gets to the one MJ had taken of Tony before the\ncompetition, he stills. Love is written unabashedly all over Tony\u2019s face, and\nhe wonders if Peter realizes it\u2019s all directed at him.</p><p>They pull up to a red light and Tony risks a glance over at\nPeter. He\u2019s still looking at the picture.</p><p>\u201cSee any you like?\u201d Tony asks, trying to sound casual. </p><p>Peter looks up at him. \u201cYeah. Yeah, there are a few I\u2019m\ngoing to print out.\u201d There\u2019s a small moment of silence as everything unsaid hangs\nin the air. \u201cThat one you got of Flash belongs in the MoMA.\u201d</p><p>Tony laughs. The light turns green and Tony eases onto the\naccelerator. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to frame it for MJ.\u201d</p><p>Two weeks later, when Maggie steals Tony\u2019s left shoe and he\nchases her into Peter\u2019s room trying to get it back, he sees three new pictures\non Peter\u2019s wall. One of Peter, Ned, and MJ celebrating their win, the second of\nTony and Peter and the trophy, the one where Tony was kissing Peter, the boy\u2019s eye\nscrunched closed in surprise, and the third, the one MJ had taken of him\nlooking at Peter.</p><p>Tony smiles to himself and leaves, deciding to just wear a\ndifferent pair of shoes. \u00a0 \u00a0</p>",

He sees Midtown, swarming around in their gold jackets. He spots\nPeter instantly, like a magnetic pull. The kid has the camera Tony gave him\naround his neck, and he\u2019s smiling as he takes a picture of Ned and MJ messing\naround. </p><p>Tony watches him fondly for a second until people start\nnoticing him, which makes Peter notice him. Tony gives him a crooked smile and\na small wave and Peter carefully pulls away from his group of friends. </p><p>\u201cHey, Tony,\u201d he says as he walks up. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it, kiddo,\u201d Tony assures, following as Peter leads\nhim through the throng of students and parents.

He&rsquo;s still looking at the picture.</p><p>&ldquo;See any you like?&rdquo; Tony asks, trying to sound casual. </p><p>Peter looks up at him. &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, there are a few I&rsquo;m\ngoing to print out.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a small moment of silence as everything unsaid hangs\nin the air. &ldquo;That one you got of Flash belongs in the MoMA.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony laughs. The light turns green and Tony eases onto the\naccelerator. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to frame it for MJ.&rdquo;</p><p>Two weeks later, when Maggie steals Tony&rsquo;s left shoe and he\nchases her into Peter&rsquo;s room trying to get it back, he sees three new pictures\non Peter&rsquo;s wall. One of Peter, Ned, and MJ celebrating their win, the second of\nTony and Peter and the trophy, the one where Tony was kissing Peter, the boy&rsquo;s eye\nscrunched closed in surprise, and the third, the one MJ had taken of him\nlooking at Peter.</p><p>Tony smiles to himself and leaves, deciding to just wear a\ndifferent pair of shoes. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",
