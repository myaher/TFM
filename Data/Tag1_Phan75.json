This one felt a bit more intimate and if Phil was being honest, that made it that much scarier to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe felt completely out place and like there was nowhere for him to hide. At Dan\u2019s party, there had been so many people that it didn\u2019t make a difference if he tried to push through the crowds of people and move on to a different area. But right now, he was stuck in the middle of a conversation at Dan\u2019s side at a pub table that was dressed up way too fancy\u2026Phil was sure that there were Swarovski crystals lining the outside. He was afraid to so much as leave a finger print on them.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan looked right in his element though and maybe that was what made Phil a tad bit more scared that he should have been. Dan looked so comfortable and poised and here was Phil, stood with his elbows on the edge of the pearl white table cloth and a half-drunk glass of Champagne stood in-between his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan had introduced him to these people who he was speaking to but Phil can\u2019t bothered to actually remember what Dan said about them. All he knew is that Dan knew them from his movie and that\u2019s all.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201c\u2026Phil lives in London.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil picked his head up and looked at Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh really? Which area?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Dan said, turning his head towards Phil. \u201cWhich area is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at the brunette who was currently stood on the other side of the table, her arms folded elegantly on the edge as her bracelets draped her forearms. \u201cVictoria.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, Victoria!\u201d She cooed in a way that made Phil want to roll his eyes. He actually doubted she knew where Victoria was. He wasn\u2019t trying to be brash about it, to be fair, he wasn\u2019t sure many people even knew London was broken up that way it was. He didn\u2019t until he looked for flats.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt quite cute.\u201d Dan commented. \u201cHis flat is near a beautiful park. And he also has the cutest puppy ever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was quite in shock. Had Dan been speaking so openly to this other person about him and he was just not paying any attention to notice? Or was Dan really just playing up the \u2018we\u2019re friends\u2019 card? Phil wasn\u2019t quite sure anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPuppy?\u201d She said. \u201cDo you have photos? I\u2019d love to see it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh course I have photos, Mimei.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil suddenly felt his stomach drop out of his ass. Was he really not paying that much attention to anything around him to know that this was Mimei Lake? She had a different hair color from the blonde locks she had in the attached photo from the email a couple months ago. Now it was a natural red color that reminded him of his own\u2015but maybe her\u2019s was a bit lighter.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pulled out his phone and put it on the table as he turned it around and showed her all of the photos of Spike he must have taken when he was in London. Phil watched as Dan scrolled through the photos but he didn\u2019t recognize any of them. Nor did he know Dan had taken so many selfies with his pup.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSpike.\u201d Dan and Phil both answered at the same time, causing Mimei to laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhere did the name come from?\u201d She asked. \u201cBecause that sounds like the name of a ferocious beast but he looks to be the cuddliest creature alive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s from a character on one of my favorite TV shows Buffy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Mimei\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBuffy? Oh my gosh, I loved Buffy as a teen! Sarah Michelle Gellar was my idol!\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cI used to have the biggest crush on her.\u201d Phi admitted with a chuckle. Dan laughed to himself next to him. \u201cMy mum used to find it weird how I had her photos hanging on the walls of my room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAmazing.\u201d Mimei commented with a smile. \u201cThat sounds like me with Aaron Carter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou both with your teenage celebrity crushes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil and Mimei both looked at Dan with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a celebrity crush?\u201d Phil asked, elbowing Dan gently in the side. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cI had celebrity crushes but I\u2019m not gonna admit them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d Phil pressed. \u201cHow bad could they be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was going to press more on the subject when someone else rounded to the table and stood by Mimei, placing her arm around Mimei\u2019s waist. \u201cHello, Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi, Dayna.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tOkay, so now Phil had another person to remember the name of. This time, their name was Dayna. That didn\u2019t seem so bad to try and remember.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, this is Dayna, Mimei\u2019s wife.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil cocked his eyebrow up. That was a pleasant surprise. Maybe that\u2019s why Dan was comfortable mentioning Phil so much around her. \u201cPleasure to meet you.\u201d Dayna said, sticking out her hand for Phil to shake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDayna, this is Phil, my boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had to admit that it took a bit of his breath away to hear Dan formally introduce him as his boyfriend to someone else. He panicked a bit, looking around to make sure that no one else heard anything. Everyone else was in their own little worlds around the tables, just mingling with each other.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAh, so you\u2019re the famous Phil who Dan wouldn\u2019t shut up about.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan with a smile just in time to see red flourish on his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t shut up about me, huh?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan just shook his head. \u201cStop embarrassing me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou do it to yourself, bud.\u201d Mimei said with a warm chuckle.</p><p>\tDayna leaned over and whispered something in Mimei\u2019s ear before Mimei looked up and smiled at them both. \u201cWe have to get going but it was great seeing you again, Dan. I know we\u2019re done filming our parts together but it was a pleasure working with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou as well.\u201d Dan nodded back as Mimei and Dayna grasped hands and headed off towards another section of the room.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThey\u2019re both super nice.\u201d Phil commented once they were gone.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cI loved working with Mimei.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlthough it was a bit awkward filming our sex scene when she\u2019s a lesbian and I\u2019m a gay male. Didn\u2019t quite work how it should have but\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the film.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil hadn\u2019t really ever said that aloud because he wasn\u2019t quite sure himself if he even was interested in the film before. But now he wants to support Dan in any way that he can.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to see it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan began to lean down and Phil was ready to accept the kiss when Dan suddenly stopped and stiffened, standing up a bit straighter and stopping his movements. \u201cWe actually probably shouldn\u2019t kiss here. Do you want to head out? I\u2019m hungry and these tiny sandwiches aren\u2019t doing much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil smiled at him and nodded and they both left, their flutes of champagne long forgotten on the table.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tDan had a driver chauffeur them around LA to get food and they managed to stop at just a quick burger place to grab food to take back to Dan\u2019s house. By the time they got back, it was well past midnight and Phil was feeling a bit tired, but still a little buzzed from the party.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was apparent that Dan was a bit buzzed himself with a second wind of energy when they both got ready for bed and Dan laid down before Phil and reached for his phone, not even blinking or yawning in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched him for a moment as he rushed out a text with his finger tips and then threw his phone off the side of the bed and turned back to Phil with a smile. \u201cHi.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil will never get tired of this. Of seeing Dan in such a natural state like lying in bed with his pajamas on, his hair slightly messy and his eyes a bit glassy from the alcohol buzzing in his system.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s said it once, and he\u2019ll say it forever but Dan really was an angel.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Dan says out of the blue.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart sink about but the hopeful look in Dan\u2019s eyes make him remember that they promised to be there for each other and to never give up on the other person. He had to remember that, even if the question had his heart beating out of his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you reckon we\u2019re moving a bit fast?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting to be the question Dan was going to ask but it certainly was not that question. He felt his heart flutter a bit more before his eyes glazed over a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was preparing for the worst. Maybe Dan was having second thoughts about all of this? Maybe Dan decided that he couldn\u2019t be with some loser like Phil who wasn\u2019t rich or famous? Maybe Dan decided that Phil wasn\u2019t good enough for him?\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a loud sigh that broke Phil out of his pessimistic thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026not anything bad, per se.\u201d Dan begins, rolling onto his back as if he\u2019s avoiding making eye contact. \u201cBut I feel as if I don\u2019t really know you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart break a bit more.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan rolled back onto his side and looked up at Phil. \u201cNo matter how I say this, I\u2019m aware I\u2019m going to look like a dick but it\u2019s just\u2026let\u2019s get to know each other, yeah? I don\u2019t want to rush forward and not know anything about you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a staggering breath. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t you giving up on me, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan suddenly shot up and moved so he was sitting onto his backside on the bed, looking straight at Phil. He reached out and placed his hands on Phil\u2019s jaw, steadying the slight wobble that it was beginning to have.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, God, no!\u201d Dan quickly reassured. \u201cYou mean the absolute world to me, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt like he wanted to believe him but his heart was still a bit ragged and his mind was a bit clouded.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one supposed to not be giving up on me, remember?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his head nod subconsciously.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo we\u2019re not breaking up?\u201d Phil asks, the question lingering in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan moved his hands around to behind Phil\u2019s neck and drew Phil closer, planting a firm kiss on his lips that cause Phil to hesitate before reciprocating. He reached around and put his hand on Dan\u2019s side, feeling the soft flesh mould under his fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan pulled away and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re it for me, Phil. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. You\u2019re my person and I can tell already that we\u2019re meant for each other. That\u2019s why I want to get to know you. Now if you\u2019re going to start crying, can you maybe warn me first because I\u2019ll cry if you cry and I really don\u2019t want to go to bed with swollen and sore eyes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a soft chuckle of relief as he and Dan disentangled themselves away from each other long enough for him to wipe away the moisture from under his eyes. \u201cNow,\u201d Dan continued. \u201cLet\u2019s play like twenty questions or something. You ask a question, I have to answered and we\u2019ll go back and forth until we either get bored or pass out. I\u2019ll go first!\u201d Dan situates himself across from Phil on the bed and smiles. \u201cHow old were you when you have your first kiss?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffed. \u201cOh we\u2019re playing this kind of twenty questions?\u201d Phil teased. \u201cWhat are we? Twelve year olds at a slumber party?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHell fucking yes, Phil!\u201d Dan bellowed out. \u201cAfter this will do each others hair and then have a pillow fight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be drinking for this?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cQuit stalling and answer the question, mate!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was sixteen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s eyes widened and Phil suddenly felt his cheeks flush. \u201cOh, Phil!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was a late bloomer.\u201d He mumbled, trying to hide the embarrassment from his voice.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan noticed and reeled the conversation back in. \u201cIf it makes you feel any different, mine was when I was age 6 with a girl named Lilith and all she did was lean forward plant her mouth on mine. It was quite gross.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh. \u201cHow old were you when you decided you wanted to go into acting?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan leaned back a bit and looked up at the ceiling of his bedroom. Phil studied his body, looking for any signs of discomfort coming from Dan just in case he stepped over a boundary that he didn\u2019t really mean to.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit of a loaded question.\u201d Dan says, finally looking down. \u201cBecause I decided I wanted to audition for my community theatre\u2019s play when I was quite young but I didn\u2019t fully decide that being an actor was something I wanted to pursue until I was about 14 or 15. It kind of came with the mentality of people always telling me I was good at it and that I had the ability to act.\u201d When he\u2019s done, Phil looks at him and notices that Dan\u2019s face is a bit sullen and a bit sad. But he doesn\u2019t look hurt or upset about answering the question. \u201cWhen did you decide to work for the BBC?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen I realized that I had no clue where I was going in life and I felt like I needed a sense of direction.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat was the honest truth. Phil applied for the BBC on a whim. He had no intentions of ever getting the job nor getting near London to even take the job. But he received it and was stuck working in the BBC in an office all day with Louise, PJ, and Gemma.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he doesn\u2019t hate what he does. He just hates that he lost the passion he once had to go work for an office in London.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd the BBC gave you that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had half a mind to joke with Dan and tell him that he couldn\u2019t ask more than one question but honestly, he felt like he needed to answer this one. Not only to give Dan an answer, but also give himself an answer as well.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil answered truthfully. \u201cIt gave me friends and it gave me memories and it gave me money. But in the end, it also gave me a job that\u2026\u201d Phil let his thoughts linger off before he looked at Dan and their eyes met and he finally spoke the words he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever speak. \u201cBut it also gave me a job that I hate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t think hate is the correct term. He doesn\u2019t hate the BBC or hate what he does. But he does hate how the BBC took up his time and his job took his time away from him to follow the true passion he used to have which is YouTube.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThen why do you stay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI thought this was going back and forth.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil partly teased that but he also kind of wanted to drop the subject and move onto something much more lighthearted than talking about how actually miserable he is. He didn\u2019t realize he was even this miserable until he began talking about the BBC right then.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan smiled at him. \u201cAsk me something then.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBe honest with me, okay?\u201d Phil began and Dan nodded. \u201cDo you wish your life wasn\u2019t like this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFollowed by paparazzi all the time? Having a house with a gate you can only get through by using an access code? Your name the source of news and headlines all over the world and fangirls crawling all over your tweets and speculating about everything you do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI hate my life, Phil.\u201d Phil looked at Dan and saw the way his jaw wobbled as he reached up and stubbornly wiped away a tear from his cheek. \u201cThis life isn\u2019t what you want, Phil. It\u2019s not even what I want anymore. And If I could leave it all behind, I would.\u201d He looked at Phil quickly before squeezing his eyes shut tightly as another tear slid down his cheek and Phil moved forward quickly to wipe it away. Dan shivered underneath his touch and opened his eyes, staring into Phil\u2019s with a grateful look. \u201cI want to be normal, like you. I want to work for the BBC in an office job and make YouTube videos and have friends who actually care about me. But I\u2019ll never get any of that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMy life was always characterized by my name and it forever will be. For fucks sake, I have word that I might even be getting a Hollywood Star of Fame sometime next year. I have no chance for a normal life anymore. I have no chance for that. And maybe it\u2019s a bit selfish but I want to live vicariously through you. I want to be with you when you go to the BBC and I want to be with you when you make your videos because any chance I have at a normal life, I want to grab at it and never let it go. Because my life will never go back to normal, Phil. It just can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil waited until everything Dan was saying was over before he studied Dan\u2019s face and watched as he wiped his tears away before sniffling and let out a shuttering breath.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry for just unloading all of that onto you.\u201d Dan says, letting out a small laugh. \u201cIt felt really good to actually get all of that out but I hope it doesn\u2019t like, scare you away or anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo, I totally get everything you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan gives him a look of \u2018you really don\u2019t but I appreciate the sentiment\u2019, before he lets out a long yawn and gives Phil a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019m really tired now. Do you want to get ready for bed?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes feel a bit sore and weary so he nods.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan stands up quickly and makes his way to the bathroom first, shutting the door behind him. Phil is left sitting on the bed, gathering all of his thoughts about everything Dan had just said to him. It was a lot to process and it was a bit hard for Phil to really think about at this hour and also with his mindset.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan came back out a few minutes later and by that time, Phil had already settled into bed under the duvet, waiting for Dan to come back. Once under the duvet, Dan immediately rolled into Phil and Phil wrapped his around him, letting himself snuggle the younger male.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe amount of vulnerability and openness that Dan showed Phil tonight was something he would never forget and he was convinced that it\u2019s something that will strengthen their relationship from this point forward into the future. Dan was right after all. They really did need to get to know each other before they can move on.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m glad we had this talk.\u201d Dan said, his voice coming out a bit muffled from talking into Phil\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pulled back a bit and Dan looked up at him in the pale moonlight of his room that was seeping in through the sheer curtains. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan leaned forward and connected their lips together. Phil pushed forward, deepening the kiss as Dan rolled onto his back willingly. Phil\u2019s been hungry for Dan\u2019s kisses all night and having Dan kissing him again was taming the embers that were firing up inside his core.</p><p>\tHe found himself hovering over Dan, lips detached from his lips and making small kisses down his jaw onto his neck. He found the soft flesh of Dan\u2019s neck and nipped at it with his teeth a bit before sucking onto the sensitive skin. Dan moaned out, reaching his hand out and placing it on the back of Phil\u2019s neck to hold him in place.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil loved this. The taste of Dan\u2019s skin on his tongue was like a delicacy that he couldn\u2019t get enough of. He pulled back and moved a bit lower, attaching his lips to Dan\u2019s collarbone.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan squirmed under him as he whimpered and continued to whine at the sensations. Phil honestly felt a bit drunk off from the pheromones Dan was giving off to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pulled away, moving his head back so he could connect their lips once more. It was a bit sloppy and a bit messy and Phil was sure their teeth might have clashed but he didn\u2019t care. Anything with Dan was amazing and nothing would ever destroy that mindset for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s hips instinctively rolled down, looking for friction to serve as relief for the heat pooling in his lower body and his cock springing to full hardness. He could feel Dan\u2019s under him, the hard outline of his own cock jutting into his hip.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d Phil asked, looking for consent given how open and vulnerable Dan was just ten or so minutes ago.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded quickly and practically begged. \u201cYes! Please keep going and don\u2019t stop.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded to Dan\u2019s command and reached his hand between them, fishing his cock out of his pajama pants and letting it spring free between them. Dan reached between them and Phil felt his hand down the same and then Dan\u2019s hips cantered up and suddenly, Phil\u2019s vision went white.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis head tipped down and found solace in the crevice between Dan\u2019s neck and shoulder as he let of a loud moan. Dan\u2019s hand wrapped around both of them and began to stroke as Phil\u2019s hips rolled forward on their own accord.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s never done this before. He\u2019s never felt the sensation of his already painful erection being stroked along someone else. The feeling of it was enough to send shivers of heat down his spine as he struggled to remain in control of his movements.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe picked his head up and looked down at Dan who was smiling lazily up at him. Phil quickly reached down and pushed Dan\u2019s hand out of the way as he took over, stroking them to his tempo and his speed.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was over far quicker than he would have liked to admit, shooting white over Dan\u2019s stomach and dribbling a bit over Dan\u2019s cock. Dan finished not long after, quickly shoving Phil out of the way as he stroked himself to completion and then fell back into a heap on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan got out of bed first to grab them something to clean up with and when he came back with a damp cloth, Phil gently used it to clean off his hand as he tucked himself back into his pajamas.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan yawned on last time before he settled into bed and leaned over, kissing Phil a few more times with quick little pecks against his lips before settling down onto Phil\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThank you.\u201d Dan whispered, just as Phil felt himself drifting off to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFor making me feel like a normal person.\u201d Dan says, his voice soft. \u201cFor actually making me feel loved and not like you\u2019re using me to say you got to sleep with the famous Dan Howell.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d never do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan pressed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan fell asleep not long after the conversation ended and Phil was left, laying back on the bed with his eyes wide open now as he processed Dan\u2019s words.\u00a0</p><p>\tThank you for actually making me feel loved.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe mere thought of someone not doing that or showing that to Dan made him actually hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\tSleep took a while to come that night.\u00a0</p>",

And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 4k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and alcohol and sexual content\u00a0</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/43743119\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>This party felt a bit different than the one that was at Dan\u2019s house just a few nights before. This one felt a bit more intimate and if Phil was being honest, that made it that much scarier to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe felt completely out place and like there was nowhere for him to hide. At Dan\u2019s party, there had been so many people that it didn\u2019t make a difference if he tried to push through the crowds of people and move on to a different area. But right now, he was stuck in the middle of a conversation at Dan\u2019s side at a pub table that was dressed up way too fancy\u2026Phil was sure that there were Swarovski crystals lining the outside. He was afraid to so much as leave a finger print on them.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan looked right in his element though and maybe that was what made Phil a tad bit more scared that he should have been. Dan looked so comfortable and poised and here was Phil, stood with his elbows on the edge of the pearl white table cloth and a half-drunk glass of Champagne stood in-between his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan had introduced him to these people who he was speaking to but Phil can\u2019t bothered to actually remember what Dan said about them. All he knew is that Dan knew them from his movie and that\u2019s all.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201c\u2026Phil lives in London.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil picked his head up and looked at Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh really? Which area?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Dan said, turning his head towards Phil. \u201cWhich area is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at the brunette who was currently stood on the other side of the table, her arms folded elegantly on the edge as her bracelets draped her forearms. \u201cVictoria.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, Victoria!\u201d She cooed in a way that made Phil want to roll his eyes. He actually doubted she knew where Victoria was. He wasn\u2019t trying to be brash about it, to be fair, he wasn\u2019t sure many people even knew London was broken up that way it was. He didn\u2019t until he looked for flats.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt quite cute.\u201d Dan commented. \u201cHis flat is near a beautiful park. And he also has the cutest puppy ever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was quite in shock. Had Dan been speaking so openly to this other person about him and he was just not paying any attention to notice? Or was Dan really just playing up the \u2018we\u2019re friends\u2019 card? Phil wasn\u2019t quite sure anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPuppy?\u201d She said. \u201cDo you have photos? I\u2019d love to see it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh course I have photos, Mimei.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil suddenly felt his stomach drop out of his ass. Was he really not paying that much attention to anything around him to know that this was Mimei Lake? She had a different hair color from the blonde locks she had in the attached photo from the email a couple months ago. Now it was a natural red color that reminded him of his own\u2015but maybe her\u2019s was a bit lighter.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pulled out his phone and put it on the table as he turned it around and showed her all of the photos of Spike he must have taken when he was in London. Phil watched as Dan scrolled through the photos but he didn\u2019t recognize any of them. Nor did he know Dan had taken so many selfies with his pup.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSpike.\u201d Dan and Phil both answered at the same time, causing Mimei to laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhere did the name come from?\u201d She asked. \u201cBecause that sounds like the name of a ferocious beast but he looks to be the cuddliest creature alive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s from a character on one of my favorite TV shows Buffy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Mimei\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBuffy? Oh my gosh, I loved Buffy as a teen! Sarah Michelle Gellar was my idol!\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cI used to have the biggest crush on her.\u201d Phi admitted with a chuckle. Dan laughed to himself next to him. \u201cMy mum used to find it weird how I had her photos hanging on the walls of my room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAmazing.\u201d Mimei commented with a smile. \u201cThat sounds like me with Aaron Carter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou both with your teenage celebrity crushes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil and Mimei both looked at Dan with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a celebrity crush?\u201d Phil asked, elbowing Dan gently in the side. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cI had celebrity crushes but I\u2019m not gonna admit them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d Phil pressed. \u201cHow bad could they be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was going to press more on the subject when someone else rounded to the table and stood by Mimei, placing her arm around Mimei\u2019s waist. \u201cHello, Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi, Dayna.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tOkay, so now Phil had another person to remember the name of. This time, their name was Dayna. That didn\u2019t seem so bad to try and remember.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, this is Dayna, Mimei\u2019s wife.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil cocked his eyebrow up. That was a pleasant surprise. Maybe that\u2019s why Dan was comfortable mentioning Phil so much around her. \u201cPleasure to meet you.\u201d Dayna said, sticking out her hand for Phil to shake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDayna, this is Phil, my boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had to admit that it took a bit of his breath away to hear Dan formally introduce him as his boyfriend to someone else. He panicked a bit, looking around to make sure that no one else heard anything. Everyone else was in their own little worlds around the tables, just mingling with each other.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAh, so you\u2019re the famous Phil who Dan wouldn\u2019t shut up about.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan with a smile just in time to see red flourish on his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t shut up about me, huh?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan just shook his head. \u201cStop embarrassing me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou do it to yourself, bud.\u201d Mimei said with a warm chuckle.</p><p>\tDayna leaned over and whispered something in Mimei\u2019s ear before Mimei looked up and smiled at them both. \u201cWe have to get going but it was great seeing you again, Dan. I know we\u2019re done filming our parts together but it was a pleasure working with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou as well.\u201d Dan nodded back as Mimei and Dayna grasped hands and headed off towards another section of the room.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThey\u2019re both super nice.\u201d Phil commented once they were gone.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cI loved working with Mimei.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlthough it was a bit awkward filming our sex scene when she\u2019s a lesbian and I\u2019m a gay male. Didn\u2019t quite work how it should have but\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the film.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil hadn\u2019t really ever said that aloud because he wasn\u2019t quite sure himself if he even was interested in the film before. But now he wants to support Dan in any way that he can.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to see it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan began to lean down and Phil was ready to accept the kiss when Dan suddenly stopped and stiffened, standing up a bit straighter and stopping his movements. \u201cWe actually probably shouldn\u2019t kiss here. Do you want to head out? I\u2019m hungry and these tiny sandwiches aren\u2019t doing much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil smiled at him and nodded and they both left, their flutes of champagne long forgotten on the table.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tDan had a driver chauffeur them around LA to get food and they managed to stop at just a quick burger place to grab food to take back to Dan\u2019s house. By the time they got back, it was well past midnight and Phil was feeling a bit tired, but still a little buzzed from the party.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was apparent that Dan was a bit buzzed himself with a second wind of energy when they both got ready for bed and Dan laid down before Phil and reached for his phone, not even blinking or yawning in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched him for a moment as he rushed out a text with his finger tips and then threw his phone off the side of the bed and turned back to Phil with a smile. \u201cHi.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil will never get tired of this. Of seeing Dan in such a natural state like lying in bed with his pajamas on, his hair slightly messy and his eyes a bit glassy from the alcohol buzzing in his system.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s said it once, and he\u2019ll say it forever but Dan really was an angel.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Dan says out of the blue.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart sink about but the hopeful look in Dan\u2019s eyes make him remember that they promised to be there for each other and to never give up on the other person. He had to remember that, even if the question had his heart beating out of his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you reckon we\u2019re moving a bit fast?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting to be the question Dan was going to ask but it certainly was not that question. He felt his heart flutter a bit more before his eyes glazed over a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was preparing for the worst. Maybe Dan was having second thoughts about all of this? Maybe Dan decided that he couldn\u2019t be with some loser like Phil who wasn\u2019t rich or famous? Maybe Dan decided that Phil wasn\u2019t good enough for him?\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a loud sigh that broke Phil out of his pessimistic thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026not anything bad, per se.\u201d Dan begins, rolling onto his back as if he\u2019s avoiding making eye contact. \u201cBut I feel as if I don\u2019t really know you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart break a bit more.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan rolled back onto his side and looked up at Phil. \u201cNo matter how I say this, I\u2019m aware I\u2019m going to look like a dick but it\u2019s just\u2026let\u2019s get to know each other, yeah? I don\u2019t want to rush forward and not know anything about you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a staggering breath. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t you giving up on me, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan suddenly shot up and moved so he was sitting onto his backside on the bed, looking straight at Phil. He reached out and placed his hands on Phil\u2019s jaw, steadying the slight wobble that it was beginning to have.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, God, no!\u201d Dan quickly reassured. \u201cYou mean the absolute world to me, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt like he wanted to believe him but his heart was still a bit ragged and his mind was a bit clouded.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one supposed to not be giving up on me, remember?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his head nod subconsciously.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo we\u2019re not breaking up?\u201d Phil asks, the question lingering in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan moved his hands around to behind Phil\u2019s neck and drew Phil closer, planting a firm kiss on his lips that cause Phil to hesitate before reciprocating. He reached around and put his hand on Dan\u2019s side, feeling the soft flesh mould under his fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan pulled away and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re it for me, Phil. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. You\u2019re my person and I can tell already that we\u2019re meant for each other. That\u2019s why I want to get to know you. Now if you\u2019re going to start crying, can you maybe warn me first because I\u2019ll cry if you cry and I really don\u2019t want to go to bed with swollen and sore eyes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a soft chuckle of relief as he and Dan disentangled themselves away from each other long enough for him to wipe away the moisture from under his eyes. \u201cNow,\u201d Dan continued. \u201cLet\u2019s play like twenty questions or something. You ask a question, I have to answered and we\u2019ll go back and forth until we either get bored or pass out. I\u2019ll go first!\u201d Dan situates himself across from Phil on the bed and smiles. \u201cHow old were you when you have your first kiss?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffed. \u201cOh we\u2019re playing this kind of twenty questions?\u201d Phil teased. \u201cWhat are we? Twelve year olds at a slumber party?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHell fucking yes, Phil!\u201d Dan bellowed out. \u201cAfter this will do each others hair and then have a pillow fight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be drinking for this?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cQuit stalling and answer the question, mate!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was sixteen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s eyes widened and Phil suddenly felt his cheeks flush. \u201cOh, Phil!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was a late bloomer.\u201d He mumbled, trying to hide the embarrassment from his voice.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan noticed and reeled the conversation back in. \u201cIf it makes you feel any different, mine was when I was age 6 with a girl named Lilith and all she did was lean forward plant her mouth on mine. It was quite gross.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh. \u201cHow old were you when you decided you wanted to go into acting?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan leaned back a bit and looked up at the ceiling of his bedroom. Phil studied his body, looking for any signs of discomfort coming from Dan just in case he stepped over a boundary that he didn\u2019t really mean to.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit of a loaded question.\u201d Dan says, finally looking down. \u201cBecause I decided I wanted to audition for my community theatre\u2019s play when I was quite young but I didn\u2019t fully decide that being an actor was something I wanted to pursue until I was about 14 or 15. It kind of came with the mentality of people always telling me I was good at it and that I had the ability to act.\u201d When he\u2019s done, Phil looks at him and notices that Dan\u2019s face is a bit sullen and a bit sad. But he doesn\u2019t look hurt or upset about answering the question. \u201cWhen did you decide to work for the BBC?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen I realized that I had no clue where I was going in life and I felt like I needed a sense of direction.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat was the honest truth. Phil applied for the BBC on a whim. He had no intentions of ever getting the job nor getting near London to even take the job. But he received it and was stuck working in the BBC in an office all day with Louise, PJ, and Gemma.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he doesn\u2019t hate what he does. He just hates that he lost the passion he once had to go work for an office in London.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd the BBC gave you that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had half a mind to joke with Dan and tell him that he couldn\u2019t ask more than one question but honestly, he felt like he needed to answer this one. Not only to give Dan an answer, but also give himself an answer as well.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil answered truthfully. \u201cIt gave me friends and it gave me memories and it gave me money. But in the end, it also gave me a job that\u2026\u201d Phil let his thoughts linger off before he looked at Dan and their eyes met and he finally spoke the words he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever speak. \u201cBut it also gave me a job that I hate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t think hate is the correct term. He doesn\u2019t hate the BBC or hate what he does. But he does hate how the BBC took up his time and his job took his time away from him to follow the true passion he used to have which is YouTube.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThen why do you stay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI thought this was going back and forth.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil partly teased that but he also kind of wanted to drop the subject and move onto something much more lighthearted than talking about how actually miserable he is. He didn\u2019t realize he was even this miserable until he began talking about the BBC right then.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan smiled at him. \u201cAsk me something then.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBe honest with me, okay?\u201d Phil began and Dan nodded. \u201cDo you wish your life wasn\u2019t like this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFollowed by paparazzi all the time? Having a house with a gate you can only get through by using an access code? Your name the source of news and headlines all over the world and fangirls crawling all over your tweets and speculating about everything you do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI hate my life, Phil.\u201d Phil looked at Dan and saw the way his jaw wobbled as he reached up and stubbornly wiped away a tear from his cheek. \u201cThis life isn\u2019t what you want, Phil. It\u2019s not even what I want anymore. And If I could leave it all behind, I would.\u201d He looked at Phil quickly before squeezing his eyes shut tightly as another tear slid down his cheek and Phil moved forward quickly to wipe it away. Dan shivered underneath his touch and opened his eyes, staring into Phil\u2019s with a grateful look. \u201cI want to be normal, like you. I want to work for the BBC in an office job and make YouTube videos and have friends who actually care about me. But I\u2019ll never get any of that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMy life was always characterized by my name and it forever will be. For fucks sake, I have word that I might even be getting a Hollywood Star of Fame sometime next year. I have no chance for a normal life anymore. I have no chance for that. And maybe it\u2019s a bit selfish but I want to live vicariously through you. I want to be with you when you go to the BBC and I want to be with you when you make your videos because any chance I have at a normal life, I want to grab at it and never let it go. Because my life will never go back to normal, Phil. It just can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil waited until everything Dan was saying was over before he studied Dan\u2019s face and watched as he wiped his tears away before sniffling and let out a shuttering breath.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry for just unloading all of that onto you.\u201d Dan says, letting out a small laugh. \u201cIt felt really good to actually get all of that out but I hope it doesn\u2019t like, scare you away or anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo, I totally get everything you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan gives him a look of \u2018you really don\u2019t but I appreciate the sentiment\u2019, before he lets out a long yawn and gives Phil a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019m really tired now. Do you want to get ready for bed?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes feel a bit sore and weary so he nods.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan stands up quickly and makes his way to the bathroom first, shutting the door behind him. Phil is left sitting on the bed, gathering all of his thoughts about everything Dan had just said to him. It was a lot to process and it was a bit hard for Phil to really think about at this hour and also with his mindset.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan came back out a few minutes later and by that time, Phil had already settled into bed under the duvet, waiting for Dan to come back. Once under the duvet, Dan immediately rolled into Phil and Phil wrapped his around him, letting himself snuggle the younger male.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe amount of vulnerability and openness that Dan showed Phil tonight was something he would never forget and he was convinced that it\u2019s something that will strengthen their relationship from this point forward into the future. Dan was right after all. They really did need to get to know each other before they can move on.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m glad we had this talk.\u201d Dan said, his voice coming out a bit muffled from talking into Phil\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pulled back a bit and Dan looked up at him in the pale moonlight of his room that was seeping in through the sheer curtains. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan leaned forward and connected their lips together. Phil pushed forward, deepening the kiss as Dan rolled onto his back willingly. Phil\u2019s been hungry for Dan\u2019s kisses all night and having Dan kissing him again was taming the embers that were firing up inside his core.</p><p>\tHe found himself hovering over Dan, lips detached from his lips and making small kisses down his jaw onto his neck. He found the soft flesh of Dan\u2019s neck and nipped at it with his teeth a bit before sucking onto the sensitive skin. Dan moaned out, reaching his hand out and placing it on the back of Phil\u2019s neck to hold him in place.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil loved this. The taste of Dan\u2019s skin on his tongue was like a delicacy that he couldn\u2019t get enough of. He pulled back and moved a bit lower, attaching his lips to Dan\u2019s collarbone.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan squirmed under him as he whimpered and continued to whine at the sensations. Phil honestly felt a bit drunk off from the pheromones Dan was giving off to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pulled away, moving his head back so he could connect their lips once more. It was a bit sloppy and a bit messy and Phil was sure their teeth might have clashed but he didn\u2019t care. Anything with Dan was amazing and nothing would ever destroy that mindset for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s hips instinctively rolled down, looking for friction to serve as relief for the heat pooling in his lower body and his cock springing to full hardness. He could feel Dan\u2019s under him, the hard outline of his own cock jutting into his hip.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d Phil asked, looking for consent given how open and vulnerable Dan was just ten or so minutes ago.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded quickly and practically begged. \u201cYes! Please keep going and don\u2019t stop.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded to Dan\u2019s command and reached his hand between them, fishing his cock out of his pajama pants and letting it spring free between them. Dan reached between them and Phil felt his hand down the same and then Dan\u2019s hips cantered up and suddenly, Phil\u2019s vision went white.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis head tipped down and found solace in the crevice between Dan\u2019s neck and shoulder as he let of a loud moan. Dan\u2019s hand wrapped around both of them and began to stroke as Phil\u2019s hips rolled forward on their own accord.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s never done this before. He\u2019s never felt the sensation of his already painful erection being stroked along someone else. The feeling of it was enough to send shivers of heat down his spine as he struggled to remain in control of his movements.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe picked his head up and looked down at Dan who was smiling lazily up at him. Phil quickly reached down and pushed Dan\u2019s hand out of the way as he took over, stroking them to his tempo and his speed.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was over far quicker than he would have liked to admit, shooting white over Dan\u2019s stomach and dribbling a bit over Dan\u2019s cock. Dan finished not long after, quickly shoving Phil out of the way as he stroked himself to completion and then fell back into a heap on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan got out of bed first to grab them something to clean up with and when he came back with a damp cloth, Phil gently used it to clean off his hand as he tucked himself back into his pajamas.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan yawned on last time before he settled into bed and leaned over, kissing Phil a few more times with quick little pecks against his lips before settling down onto Phil\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThank you.\u201d Dan whispered, just as Phil felt himself drifting off to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFor making me feel like a normal person.\u201d Dan says, his voice soft. \u201cFor actually making me feel loved and not like you\u2019re using me to say you got to sleep with the famous Dan Howell.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d never do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan pressed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan fell asleep not long after the conversation ended and Phil was left, laying back on the bed with his eyes wide open now as he processed Dan\u2019s words.\u00a0</p><p>\tThank you for actually making me feel loved.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe mere thought of someone not doing that or showing that to Dan made him actually hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\tSleep took a while to come that night.\u00a0</p>",

Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood \u2018It\u2019 star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 4k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and alcohol and sexual content\u00a0</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/43743119\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>This party felt a bit different than the one that was at Dan\u2019s house just a few nights before. This one felt a bit more intimate and if Phil was being honest, that made it that much scarier to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe felt completely out place and like there was nowhere for him to hide. At Dan\u2019s party, there had been so many people that it didn\u2019t make a difference if he tried to push through the crowds of people and move on to a different area. But right now, he was stuck in the middle of a conversation at Dan\u2019s side at a pub table that was dressed up way too fancy\u2026Phil was sure that there were Swarovski crystals lining the outside. He was afraid to so much as leave a finger print on them.\u00a0\t</p><p>\tDan looked right in his element though and maybe that was what made Phil a tad bit more scared that he should have been. Dan looked so comfortable and poised and here was Phil, stood with his elbows on the edge of the pearl white table cloth and a half-drunk glass of Champagne stood in-between his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan had introduced him to these people who he was speaking to but Phil can\u2019t bothered to actually remember what Dan said about them. All he knew is that Dan knew them from his movie and that\u2019s all.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201c\u2026Phil lives in London.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil picked his head up and looked at Dan.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh really? Which area?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Dan said, turning his head towards Phil. \u201cWhich area is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at the brunette who was currently stood on the other side of the table, her arms folded elegantly on the edge as her bracelets draped her forearms. \u201cVictoria.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh, Victoria!\u201d She cooed in a way that made Phil want to roll his eyes. He actually doubted she knew where Victoria was. He wasn\u2019t trying to be brash about it, to be fair, he wasn\u2019t sure many people even knew London was broken up that way it was. He didn\u2019t until he looked for flats.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt quite cute.\u201d Dan commented. \u201cHis flat is near a beautiful park. And he also has the cutest puppy ever.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was quite in shock. Had Dan been speaking so openly to this other person about him and he was just not paying any attention to notice? Or was Dan really just playing up the \u2018we\u2019re friends\u2019 card? Phil wasn\u2019t quite sure anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPuppy?\u201d She said. \u201cDo you have photos? I\u2019d love to see it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOh course I have photos, Mimei.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil suddenly felt his stomach drop out of his ass. Was he really not paying that much attention to anything around him to know that this was Mimei Lake? She had a different hair color from the blonde locks she had in the attached photo from the email a couple months ago. Now it was a natural red color that reminded him of his own\u2015but maybe her\u2019s was a bit lighter.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pulled out his phone and put it on the table as he turned it around and showed her all of the photos of Spike he must have taken when he was in London. Phil watched as Dan scrolled through the photos but he didn\u2019t recognize any of them. Nor did he know Dan had taken so many selfies with his pup.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSpike.\u201d Dan and Phil both answered at the same time, causing Mimei to laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhere did the name come from?\u201d She asked. \u201cBecause that sounds like the name of a ferocious beast but he looks to be the cuddliest creature alive.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s from a character on one of my favorite TV shows Buffy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched as Mimei\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBuffy? Oh my gosh, I loved Buffy as a teen! Sarah Michelle Gellar was my idol!\u201d\u00a0\t</p><p>\t\u201cI used to have the biggest crush on her.\u201d Phi admitted with a chuckle. Dan laughed to himself next to him. \u201cMy mum used to find it weird how I had her photos hanging on the walls of my room.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAmazing.\u201d Mimei commented with a smile. \u201cThat sounds like me with Aaron Carter.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou both with your teenage celebrity crushes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil and Mimei both looked at Dan with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a celebrity crush?\u201d Phil asked, elbowing Dan gently in the side. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhy?\u201d Dan asked. \u201cI had celebrity crushes but I\u2019m not gonna admit them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d Phil pressed. \u201cHow bad could they be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m not saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil was going to press more on the subject when someone else rounded to the table and stood by Mimei, placing her arm around Mimei\u2019s waist. \u201cHello, Dan.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi, Dayna.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tOkay, so now Phil had another person to remember the name of. This time, their name was Dayna. That didn\u2019t seem so bad to try and remember.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cPhil, this is Dayna, Mimei\u2019s wife.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil cocked his eyebrow up. That was a pleasant surprise. Maybe that\u2019s why Dan was comfortable mentioning Phil so much around her. \u201cPleasure to meet you.\u201d Dayna said, sticking out her hand for Phil to shake.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDayna, this is Phil, my boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had to admit that it took a bit of his breath away to hear Dan formally introduce him as his boyfriend to someone else. He panicked a bit, looking around to make sure that no one else heard anything. Everyone else was in their own little worlds around the tables, just mingling with each other.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAh, so you\u2019re the famous Phil who Dan wouldn\u2019t shut up about.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan with a smile just in time to see red flourish on his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t shut up about me, huh?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan just shook his head. \u201cStop embarrassing me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou do it to yourself, bud.\u201d Mimei said with a warm chuckle.</p><p>\tDayna leaned over and whispered something in Mimei\u2019s ear before Mimei looked up and smiled at them both. \u201cWe have to get going but it was great seeing you again, Dan. I know we\u2019re done filming our parts together but it was a pleasure working with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cYou as well.\u201d Dan nodded back as Mimei and Dayna grasped hands and headed off towards another section of the room.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThey\u2019re both super nice.\u201d Phil commented once they were gone.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded. \u201cI loved working with Mimei.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlthough it was a bit awkward filming our sex scene when she\u2019s a lesbian and I\u2019m a gay male. Didn\u2019t quite work how it should have but\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the film.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil hadn\u2019t really ever said that aloud because he wasn\u2019t quite sure himself if he even was interested in the film before. But now he wants to support Dan in any way that he can.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to see it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan began to lean down and Phil was ready to accept the kiss when Dan suddenly stopped and stiffened, standing up a bit straighter and stopping his movements. \u201cWe actually probably shouldn\u2019t kiss here. Do you want to head out? I\u2019m hungry and these tiny sandwiches aren\u2019t doing much.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil smiled at him and nodded and they both left, their flutes of champagne long forgotten on the table.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tDan had a driver chauffeur them around LA to get food and they managed to stop at just a quick burger place to grab food to take back to Dan\u2019s house. By the time they got back, it was well past midnight and Phil was feeling a bit tired, but still a little buzzed from the party.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was apparent that Dan was a bit buzzed himself with a second wind of energy when they both got ready for bed and Dan laid down before Phil and reached for his phone, not even blinking or yawning in the process.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watched him for a moment as he rushed out a text with his finger tips and then threw his phone off the side of the bed and turned back to Phil with a smile. \u201cHi.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHi.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil will never get tired of this. Of seeing Dan in such a natural state like lying in bed with his pajamas on, his hair slightly messy and his eyes a bit glassy from the alcohol buzzing in his system.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s said it once, and he\u2019ll say it forever but Dan really was an angel.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Dan says out of the blue.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart sink about but the hopeful look in Dan\u2019s eyes make him remember that they promised to be there for each other and to never give up on the other person. He had to remember that, even if the question had his heart beating out of his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDo you reckon we\u2019re moving a bit fast?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting to be the question Dan was going to ask but it certainly was not that question. He felt his heart flutter a bit more before his eyes glazed over a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was preparing for the worst. Maybe Dan was having second thoughts about all of this? Maybe Dan decided that he couldn\u2019t be with some loser like Phil who wasn\u2019t rich or famous? Maybe Dan decided that Phil wasn\u2019t good enough for him?\u00a0</p><p>\tDan let out a loud sigh that broke Phil out of his pessimistic thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026not anything bad, per se.\u201d Dan begins, rolling onto his back as if he\u2019s avoiding making eye contact. \u201cBut I feel as if I don\u2019t really know you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart break a bit more.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan rolled back onto his side and looked up at Phil. \u201cNo matter how I say this, I\u2019m aware I\u2019m going to look like a dick but it\u2019s just\u2026let\u2019s get to know each other, yeah? I don\u2019t want to rush forward and not know anything about you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a staggering breath. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t you giving up on me, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan suddenly shot up and moved so he was sitting onto his backside on the bed, looking straight at Phil. He reached out and placed his hands on Phil\u2019s jaw, steadying the slight wobble that it was beginning to have.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo, God, no!\u201d Dan quickly reassured. \u201cYou mean the absolute world to me, Phil.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt like he wanted to believe him but his heart was still a bit ragged and his mind was a bit clouded.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one supposed to not be giving up on me, remember?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil felt his head nod subconsciously.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cSo we\u2019re not breaking up?\u201d Phil asks, the question lingering in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan moved his hands around to behind Phil\u2019s neck and drew Phil closer, planting a firm kiss on his lips that cause Phil to hesitate before reciprocating. He reached around and put his hand on Dan\u2019s side, feeling the soft flesh mould under his fingers.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan pulled away and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re it for me, Phil. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. You\u2019re my person and I can tell already that we\u2019re meant for each other. That\u2019s why I want to get to know you. Now if you\u2019re going to start crying, can you maybe warn me first because I\u2019ll cry if you cry and I really don\u2019t want to go to bed with swollen and sore eyes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a soft chuckle of relief as he and Dan disentangled themselves away from each other long enough for him to wipe away the moisture from under his eyes. \u201cNow,\u201d Dan continued. \u201cLet\u2019s play like twenty questions or something. You ask a question, I have to answered and we\u2019ll go back and forth until we either get bored or pass out. I\u2019ll go first!\u201d Dan situates himself across from Phil on the bed and smiles. \u201cHow old were you when you have your first kiss?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil scoffed. \u201cOh we\u2019re playing this kind of twenty questions?\u201d Phil teased. \u201cWhat are we? Twelve year olds at a slumber party?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cHell fucking yes, Phil!\u201d Dan bellowed out. \u201cAfter this will do each others hair and then have a pillow fight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be drinking for this?\u201d Phil asks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cQuit stalling and answer the question, mate!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was sixteen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan\u2019s eyes widened and Phil suddenly felt his cheeks flush. \u201cOh, Phil!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI was a late bloomer.\u201d He mumbled, trying to hide the embarrassment from his voice.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan noticed and reeled the conversation back in. \u201cIf it makes you feel any different, mine was when I was age 6 with a girl named Lilith and all she did was lean forward plant her mouth on mine. It was quite gross.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh. \u201cHow old were you when you decided you wanted to go into acting?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan leaned back a bit and looked up at the ceiling of his bedroom. Phil studied his body, looking for any signs of discomfort coming from Dan just in case he stepped over a boundary that he didn\u2019t really mean to.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit of a loaded question.\u201d Dan says, finally looking down. \u201cBecause I decided I wanted to audition for my community theatre\u2019s play when I was quite young but I didn\u2019t fully decide that being an actor was something I wanted to pursue until I was about 14 or 15. It kind of came with the mentality of people always telling me I was good at it and that I had the ability to act.\u201d When he\u2019s done, Phil looks at him and notices that Dan\u2019s face is a bit sullen and a bit sad. But he doesn\u2019t look hurt or upset about answering the question. \u201cWhen did you decide to work for the BBC?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhen I realized that I had no clue where I was going in life and I felt like I needed a sense of direction.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThat was the honest truth. Phil applied for the BBC on a whim. He had no intentions of ever getting the job nor getting near London to even take the job. But he received it and was stuck working in the BBC in an office all day with Louise, PJ, and Gemma.\u00a0</p><p>\tBut he doesn\u2019t hate what he does. He just hates that he lost the passion he once had to go work for an office in London.</p><p>\t\u201cAnd the BBC gave you that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil had half a mind to joke with Dan and tell him that he couldn\u2019t ask more than one question but honestly, he felt like he needed to answer this one. Not only to give Dan an answer, but also give himself an answer as well.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cNo.\u201d Phil answered truthfully. \u201cIt gave me friends and it gave me memories and it gave me money. But in the end, it also gave me a job that\u2026\u201d Phil let his thoughts linger off before he looked at Dan and their eyes met and he finally spoke the words he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever speak. \u201cBut it also gave me a job that I hate.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil doesn\u2019t think hate is the correct term. He doesn\u2019t hate the BBC or hate what he does. But he does hate how the BBC took up his time and his job took his time away from him to follow the true passion he used to have which is YouTube.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThen why do you stay?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI thought this was going back and forth.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil partly teased that but he also kind of wanted to drop the subject and move onto something much more lighthearted than talking about how actually miserable he is. He didn\u2019t realize he was even this miserable until he began talking about the BBC right then.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan smiled at him. \u201cAsk me something then.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBe honest with me, okay?\u201d Phil began and Dan nodded. \u201cDo you wish your life wasn\u2019t like this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cLike what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFollowed by paparazzi all the time? Having a house with a gate you can only get through by using an access code? Your name the source of news and headlines all over the world and fangirls crawling all over your tweets and speculating about everything you do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI hate my life, Phil.\u201d Phil looked at Dan and saw the way his jaw wobbled as he reached up and stubbornly wiped away a tear from his cheek. \u201cThis life isn\u2019t what you want, Phil. It\u2019s not even what I want anymore. And If I could leave it all behind, I would.\u201d He looked at Phil quickly before squeezing his eyes shut tightly as another tear slid down his cheek and Phil moved forward quickly to wipe it away. Dan shivered underneath his touch and opened his eyes, staring into Phil\u2019s with a grateful look. \u201cI want to be normal, like you. I want to work for the BBC in an office job and make YouTube videos and have friends who actually care about me. But I\u2019ll never get any of that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tMy life was always characterized by my name and it forever will be. For fucks sake, I have word that I might even be getting a Hollywood Star of Fame sometime next year. I have no chance for a normal life anymore. I have no chance for that. And maybe it\u2019s a bit selfish but I want to live vicariously through you. I want to be with you when you go to the BBC and I want to be with you when you make your videos because any chance I have at a normal life, I want to grab at it and never let it go. Because my life will never go back to normal, Phil. It just can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil waited until everything Dan was saying was over before he studied Dan\u2019s face and watched as he wiped his tears away before sniffling and let out a shuttering breath.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry for just unloading all of that onto you.\u201d Dan says, letting out a small laugh. \u201cIt felt really good to actually get all of that out but I hope it doesn\u2019t like, scare you away or anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. \u201cNo, I totally get everything you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan gives him a look of \u2018you really don\u2019t but I appreciate the sentiment\u2019, before he lets out a long yawn and gives Phil a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019m really tired now. Do you want to get ready for bed?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s eyes feel a bit sore and weary so he nods.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan stands up quickly and makes his way to the bathroom first, shutting the door behind him. Phil is left sitting on the bed, gathering all of his thoughts about everything Dan had just said to him. It was a lot to process and it was a bit hard for Phil to really think about at this hour and also with his mindset.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan came back out a few minutes later and by that time, Phil had already settled into bed under the duvet, waiting for Dan to come back. Once under the duvet, Dan immediately rolled into Phil and Phil wrapped his around him, letting himself snuggle the younger male.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe amount of vulnerability and openness that Dan showed Phil tonight was something he would never forget and he was convinced that it\u2019s something that will strengthen their relationship from this point forward into the future. Dan was right after all. They really did need to get to know each other before they can move on.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m glad we had this talk.\u201d Dan said, his voice coming out a bit muffled from talking into Phil\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pulled back a bit and Dan looked up at him in the pale moonlight of his room that was seeping in through the sheer curtains. \u201cMe too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan leaned forward and connected their lips together. Phil pushed forward, deepening the kiss as Dan rolled onto his back willingly. Phil\u2019s been hungry for Dan\u2019s kisses all night and having Dan kissing him again was taming the embers that were firing up inside his core.</p><p>\tHe found himself hovering over Dan, lips detached from his lips and making small kisses down his jaw onto his neck. He found the soft flesh of Dan\u2019s neck and nipped at it with his teeth a bit before sucking onto the sensitive skin. Dan moaned out, reaching his hand out and placing it on the back of Phil\u2019s neck to hold him in place.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil loved this. The taste of Dan\u2019s skin on his tongue was like a delicacy that he couldn\u2019t get enough of. He pulled back and moved a bit lower, attaching his lips to Dan\u2019s collarbone.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan squirmed under him as he whimpered and continued to whine at the sensations. Phil honestly felt a bit drunk off from the pheromones Dan was giving off to him.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe pulled away, moving his head back so he could connect their lips once more. It was a bit sloppy and a bit messy and Phil was sure their teeth might have clashed but he didn\u2019t care. Anything with Dan was amazing and nothing would ever destroy that mindset for him.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil\u2019s hips instinctively rolled down, looking for friction to serve as relief for the heat pooling in his lower body and his cock springing to full hardness. He could feel Dan\u2019s under him, the hard outline of his own cock jutting into his hip.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d Phil asked, looking for consent given how open and vulnerable Dan was just ten or so minutes ago.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nodded quickly and practically begged. \u201cYes! Please keep going and don\u2019t stop.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil nodded to Dan\u2019s command and reached his hand between them, fishing his cock out of his pajama pants and letting it spring free between them. Dan reached between them and Phil felt his hand down the same and then Dan\u2019s hips cantered up and suddenly, Phil\u2019s vision went white.\u00a0</p><p>\tHis head tipped down and found solace in the crevice between Dan\u2019s neck and shoulder as he let of a loud moan. Dan\u2019s hand wrapped around both of them and began to stroke as Phil\u2019s hips rolled forward on their own accord.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s never done this before. He\u2019s never felt the sensation of his already painful erection being stroked along someone else. The feeling of it was enough to send shivers of heat down his spine as he struggled to remain in control of his movements.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe picked his head up and looked down at Dan who was smiling lazily up at him. Phil quickly reached down and pushed Dan\u2019s hand out of the way as he took over, stroking them to his tempo and his speed.\u00a0</p><p>\tIt was over far quicker than he would have liked to admit, shooting white over Dan\u2019s stomach and dribbling a bit over Dan\u2019s cock. Dan finished not long after, quickly shoving Phil out of the way as he stroked himself to completion and then fell back into a heap on the bed.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan got out of bed first to grab them something to clean up with and when he came back with a damp cloth, Phil gently used it to clean off his hand as he tucked himself back into his pajamas.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan yawned on last time before he settled into bed and leaned over, kissing Phil a few more times with quick little pecks against his lips before settling down onto Phil\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThank you.\u201d Dan whispered, just as Phil felt himself drifting off to sleep.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cFor making me feel like a normal person.\u201d Dan says, his voice soft. \u201cFor actually making me feel loved and not like you\u2019re using me to say you got to sleep with the famous Dan Howell.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019d never do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan pressed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan fell asleep not long after the conversation ended and Phil was left, laying back on the bed with his eyes wide open now as he processed Dan\u2019s words.\u00a0</p><p>\tThank you for actually making me feel loved.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe mere thought of someone not doing that or showing that to Dan made him actually hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\tSleep took a while to come that night.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary</b>: Phil Lester was a worker for the BBC in London. Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br /></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 4k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and alcohol and sexual content&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/43743119\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><p>This party felt a bit different than the one that was at Dan&rsquo;s house just a few nights before. This one felt a bit more intimate and if Phil was being honest, that made it that much scarier to him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe felt completely out place and like there was nowhere for him to hide. At Dan&rsquo;s party, there had been so many people that it didn&rsquo;t make a difference if he tried to push through the crowds of people and move on to a different area. But right now, he was stuck in the middle of a conversation at Dan&rsquo;s side at a pub table that was dressed up way too fancy&hellip;Phil was sure that there were Swarovski crystals lining the outside. He was afraid to so much as leave a finger print on them.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\tDan looked right in his element though and maybe that was what made Phil a tad bit more scared that he should have been. Dan looked so comfortable and poised and here was Phil, stood with his elbows on the edge of the pearl white table cloth and a half-drunk glass of Champagne stood in-between his hands.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan had introduced him to these people who he was speaking to but Phil can&rsquo;t bothered to actually remember what Dan said about them. All he knew is that Dan knew them from his movie and that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;&hellip;Phil lives in London.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil picked his head up and looked at Dan.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh really? Which area?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Dan said, turning his head towards Phil. &ldquo;Which area is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looked at the brunette who was currently stood on the other side of the table, her arms folded elegantly on the edge as her bracelets draped her forearms. &ldquo;Victoria.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh, Victoria!&rdquo; She cooed in a way that made Phil want to roll his eyes. He actually doubted she knew where Victoria was. He wasn&rsquo;t trying to be brash about it, to be fair, he wasn&rsquo;t sure many people even knew London was broken up that way it was. He didn&rsquo;t until he looked for flats.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It quite cute.&rdquo; Dan commented. &ldquo;His flat is near a beautiful park. And he also has the cutest puppy ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil was quite in shock. Had Dan been speaking so openly to this other person about him and he was just not paying any attention to notice? Or was Dan really just playing up the &lsquo;we&rsquo;re friends&rsquo; card? Phil wasn&rsquo;t quite sure anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Puppy?&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;Do you have photos? I&rsquo;d love to see it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Oh course I have photos, Mimei.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil suddenly felt his stomach drop out of his ass. Was he really not paying that much attention to anything around him to know that this was Mimei Lake? She had a different hair color from the blonde locks she had in the attached photo from the email a couple months ago. Now it was a natural red color that reminded him of his own&#8213;but maybe her&rsquo;s was a bit lighter.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watched as Dan pulled out his phone and put it on the table as he turned it around and showed her all of the photos of Spike he must have taken when he was in London. Phil watched as Dan scrolled through the photos but he didn&rsquo;t recognize any of them. Nor did he know Dan had taken so many selfies with his pup.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Spike.&rdquo; Dan and Phil both answered at the same time, causing Mimei to laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Where did the name come from?&rdquo; She asked. &ldquo;Because that sounds like the name of a ferocious beast but he looks to be the cuddliest creature alive.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from a character on one of my favorite TV shows Buffy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watched as Mimei&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;Buffy? Oh my gosh, I loved Buffy as a teen! Sarah Michelle Gellar was my idol!&rdquo;&nbsp;\t</p><p>\t&ldquo;I used to have the biggest crush on her.&rdquo; Phi admitted with a chuckle. Dan laughed to himself next to him. &ldquo;My mum used to find it weird how I had her photos hanging on the walls of my room.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo; Mimei commented with a smile. &ldquo;That sounds like me with Aaron Carter.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You both with your teenage celebrity crushes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil and Mimei both looked at Dan with wide eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never had a celebrity crush?&rdquo; Phil asked, elbowing Dan gently in the side. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to believe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Dan asked. &ldquo;I had celebrity crushes but I&rsquo;m not gonna admit them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Phil pressed. &ldquo;How bad could they be?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil was going to press more on the subject when someone else rounded to the table and stood by Mimei, placing her arm around Mimei&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;Hello, Dan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi, Dayna.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tOkay, so now Phil had another person to remember the name of. This time, their name was Dayna. That didn&rsquo;t seem so bad to try and remember.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Phil, this is Dayna, Mimei&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil cocked his eyebrow up. That was a pleasant surprise. Maybe that&rsquo;s why Dan was comfortable mentioning Phil so much around her. &ldquo;Pleasure to meet you.&rdquo; Dayna said, sticking out her hand for Phil to shake.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Dayna, this is Phil, my boyfriend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil had to admit that it took a bit of his breath away to hear Dan formally introduce him as his boyfriend to someone else. He panicked a bit, looking around to make sure that no one else heard anything. Everyone else was in their own little worlds around the tables, just mingling with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Ah, so you&rsquo;re the famous Phil who Dan wouldn&rsquo;t shut up about.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil looked at Dan with a smile just in time to see red flourish on his cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t shut up about me, huh?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan just shook his head. &ldquo;Stop embarrassing me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You do it to yourself, bud.&rdquo; Mimei said with a warm chuckle.</p><p>\tDayna leaned over and whispered something in Mimei&rsquo;s ear before Mimei looked up and smiled at them both. &ldquo;We have to get going but it was great seeing you again, Dan. I know we&rsquo;re done filming our parts together but it was a pleasure working with you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;You as well.&rdquo; Dan nodded back as Mimei and Dayna grasped hands and headed off towards another section of the room.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both super nice.&rdquo; Phil commented once they were gone.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nodded. &ldquo;I loved working with Mimei.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Although it was a bit awkward filming our sex scene when she&rsquo;s a lesbian and I&rsquo;m a gay male. Didn&rsquo;t quite work how it should have but&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see the film.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil hadn&rsquo;t really ever said that aloud because he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure himself if he even was interested in the film before. But now he wants to support Dan in any way that he can.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for you to see it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan began to lean down and Phil was ready to accept the kiss when Dan suddenly stopped and stiffened, standing up a bit straighter and stopping his movements. &ldquo;We actually probably shouldn&rsquo;t kiss here. Do you want to head out? I&rsquo;m hungry and these tiny sandwiches aren&rsquo;t doing much.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil smiled at him and nodded and they both left, their flutes of champagne long forgotten on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\tDan had a driver chauffeur them around LA to get food and they managed to stop at just a quick burger place to grab food to take back to Dan&rsquo;s house. By the time they got back, it was well past midnight and Phil was feeling a bit tired, but still a little buzzed from the party.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt was apparent that Dan was a bit buzzed himself with a second wind of energy when they both got ready for bed and Dan laid down before Phil and reached for his phone, not even blinking or yawning in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watched him for a moment as he rushed out a text with his finger tips and then threw his phone off the side of the bed and turned back to Phil with a smile. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil will never get tired of this. Of seeing Dan in such a natural state like lying in bed with his pajamas on, his hair slightly messy and his eyes a bit glassy from the alcohol buzzing in his system.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s said it once, and he&rsquo;ll say it forever but Dan really was an angel.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; Dan says out of the blue.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart sink about but the hopeful look in Dan&rsquo;s eyes make him remember that they promised to be there for each other and to never give up on the other person. He had to remember that, even if the question had his heart beating out of his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Do you reckon we&rsquo;re moving a bit fast?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t know what he was expecting to be the question Dan was going to ask but it certainly was not that question. He felt his heart flutter a bit more before his eyes glazed over a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe was preparing for the worst. Maybe Dan was having second thoughts about all of this? Maybe Dan decided that he couldn&rsquo;t be with some loser like Phil who wasn&rsquo;t rich or famous? Maybe Dan decided that Phil wasn&rsquo;t good enough for him?&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan let out a loud sigh that broke Phil out of his pessimistic thoughts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;not anything bad, per se.&rdquo; Dan begins, rolling onto his back as if he&rsquo;s avoiding making eye contact. &ldquo;But I feel as if I don&rsquo;t really know you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his heart break a bit more.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan rolled back onto his side and looked up at Phil. &ldquo;No matter how I say this, I&rsquo;m aware I&rsquo;m going to look like a dick but it&rsquo;s just&hellip;let&rsquo;s get to know each other, yeah? I don&rsquo;t want to rush forward and not know anything about you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let out a staggering breath. &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t you giving up on me, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan suddenly shot up and moved so he was sitting onto his backside on the bed, looking straight at Phil. He reached out and placed his hands on Phil&rsquo;s jaw, steadying the slight wobble that it was beginning to have.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No, God, no!&rdquo; Dan quickly reassured. &ldquo;You mean the absolute world to me, Phil.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt like he wanted to believe him but his heart was still a bit ragged and his mind was a bit clouded.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re the one supposed to not be giving up on me, remember?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil felt his head nod subconsciously.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re not breaking up?&rdquo; Phil asks, the question lingering in the air.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan moved his hands around to behind Phil&rsquo;s neck and drew Phil closer, planting a firm kiss on his lips that cause Phil to hesitate before reciprocating. He reached around and put his hand on Dan&rsquo;s side, feeling the soft flesh mould under his fingers.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan pulled away and shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re it for me, Phil. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say. You&rsquo;re my person and I can tell already that we&rsquo;re meant for each other. That&rsquo;s why I want to get to know you. Now if you&rsquo;re going to start crying, can you maybe warn me first because I&rsquo;ll cry if you cry and I really don&rsquo;t want to go to bed with swollen and sore eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let out a soft chuckle of relief as he and Dan disentangled themselves away from each other long enough for him to wipe away the moisture from under his eyes. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Dan continued. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play like twenty questions or something. You ask a question, I have to answered and we&rsquo;ll go back and forth until we either get bored or pass out. I&rsquo;ll go first!&rdquo; Dan situates himself across from Phil on the bed and smiles. &ldquo;How old were you when you have your first kiss?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil scoffed. &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;re playing this kind of twenty questions?&rdquo; Phil teased. &ldquo;What are we? Twelve year olds at a slumber party?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Hell fucking yes, Phil!&rdquo; Dan bellowed out. &ldquo;After this will do each others hair and then have a pillow fight.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be drinking for this?&rdquo; Phil asks.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Quit stalling and answer the question, mate!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I was sixteen.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan&rsquo;s eyes widened and Phil suddenly felt his cheeks flush. &ldquo;Oh, Phil!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I was a late bloomer.&rdquo; He mumbled, trying to hide the embarrassment from his voice.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan noticed and reeled the conversation back in. &ldquo;If it makes you feel any different, mine was when I was age 6 with a girl named Lilith and all she did was lean forward plant her mouth on mine. It was quite gross.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let out a laugh. &ldquo;How old were you when you decided you wanted to go into acting?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan leaned back a bit and looked up at the ceiling of his bedroom. Phil studied his body, looking for any signs of discomfort coming from Dan just in case he stepped over a boundary that he didn&rsquo;t really mean to.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a bit of a loaded question.&rdquo; Dan says, finally looking down. &ldquo;Because I decided I wanted to audition for my community theatre&rsquo;s play when I was quite young but I didn&rsquo;t fully decide that being an actor was something I wanted to pursue until I was about 14 or 15. It kind of came with the mentality of people always telling me I was good at it and that I had the ability to act.&rdquo; When he&rsquo;s done, Phil looks at him and notices that Dan&rsquo;s face is a bit sullen and a bit sad. But he doesn&rsquo;t look hurt or upset about answering the question. &ldquo;When did you decide to work for the BBC?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;When I realized that I had no clue where I was going in life and I felt like I needed a sense of direction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThat was the honest truth. Phil applied for the BBC on a whim. He had no intentions of ever getting the job nor getting near London to even take the job. But he received it and was stuck working in the BBC in an office all day with Louise, PJ, and Gemma.&nbsp;</p><p>\tBut he doesn&rsquo;t hate what he does. He just hates that he lost the passion he once had to go work for an office in London.</p><p>\t&ldquo;And the BBC gave you that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil had half a mind to joke with Dan and tell him that he couldn&rsquo;t ask more than one question but honestly, he felt like he needed to answer this one. Not only to give Dan an answer, but also give himself an answer as well.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Phil answered truthfully. &ldquo;It gave me friends and it gave me memories and it gave me money. But in the end, it also gave me a job that&hellip;&rdquo; Phil let his thoughts linger off before he looked at Dan and their eyes met and he finally spoke the words he hadn&rsquo;t thought he&rsquo;d ever speak. &ldquo;But it also gave me a job that I hate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil doesn&rsquo;t think hate is the correct term. He doesn&rsquo;t hate the BBC or hate what he does. But he does hate how the BBC took up his time and his job took his time away from him to follow the true passion he used to have which is YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Then why do you stay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I thought this was going back and forth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil partly teased that but he also kind of wanted to drop the subject and move onto something much more lighthearted than talking about how actually miserable he is. He didn&rsquo;t realize he was even this miserable until he began talking about the BBC right then.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan smiled at him. &ldquo;Ask me something then.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Be honest with me, okay?&rdquo; Phil began and Dan nodded. &ldquo;Do you wish your life wasn&rsquo;t like this?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Followed by paparazzi all the time? Having a house with a gate you can only get through by using an access code? Your name the source of news and headlines all over the world and fangirls crawling all over your tweets and speculating about everything you do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I hate my life, Phil.&rdquo; Phil looked at Dan and saw the way his jaw wobbled as he reached up and stubbornly wiped away a tear from his cheek. &ldquo;This life isn&rsquo;t what you want, Phil. It&rsquo;s not even what I want anymore. And If I could leave it all behind, I would.&rdquo; He looked at Phil quickly before squeezing his eyes shut tightly as another tear slid down his cheek and Phil moved forward quickly to wipe it away. Dan shivered underneath his touch and opened his eyes, staring into Phil&rsquo;s with a grateful look. &ldquo;I want to be normal, like you. I want to work for the BBC in an office job and make YouTube videos and have friends who actually care about me. But I&rsquo;ll never get any of that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tMy life was always characterized by my name and it forever will be. For fucks sake, I have word that I might even be getting a Hollywood Star of Fame sometime next year. I have no chance for a normal life anymore. I have no chance for that. And maybe it&rsquo;s a bit selfish but I want to live vicariously through you. I want to be with you when you go to the BBC and I want to be with you when you make your videos because any chance I have at a normal life, I want to grab at it and never let it go. Because my life will never go back to normal, Phil. It just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil waited until everything Dan was saying was over before he studied Dan&rsquo;s face and watched as he wiped his tears away before sniffling and let out a shuttering breath.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for just unloading all of that onto you.&rdquo; Dan says, letting out a small laugh. &ldquo;It felt really good to actually get all of that out but I hope it doesn&rsquo;t like, scare you away or anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil shook his head. &ldquo;No, I totally get everything you&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan gives him a look of &lsquo;you really don&rsquo;t but I appreciate the sentiment&rsquo;, before he lets out a long yawn and gives Phil a sympathetic look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really tired now. Do you want to get ready for bed?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s eyes feel a bit sore and weary so he nods.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan stands up quickly and makes his way to the bathroom first, shutting the door behind him. Phil is left sitting on the bed, gathering all of his thoughts about everything Dan had just said to him. It was a lot to process and it was a bit hard for Phil to really think about at this hour and also with his mindset.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan came back out a few minutes later and by that time, Phil had already settled into bed under the duvet, waiting for Dan to come back. Once under the duvet, Dan immediately rolled into Phil and Phil wrapped his around him, letting himself snuggle the younger male.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe amount of vulnerability and openness that Dan showed Phil tonight was something he would never forget and he was convinced that it&rsquo;s something that will strengthen their relationship from this point forward into the future. Dan was right after all. They really did need to get to know each other before they can move on.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we had this talk.&rdquo; Dan said, his voice coming out a bit muffled from talking into Phil&rsquo;s chest.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe pulled back a bit and Dan looked up at him in the pale moonlight of his room that was seeping in through the sheer curtains. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan leaned forward and connected their lips together. Phil pushed forward, deepening the kiss as Dan rolled onto his back willingly. Phil&rsquo;s been hungry for Dan&rsquo;s kisses all night and having Dan kissing him again was taming the embers that were firing up inside his core.</p><p>\tHe found himself hovering over Dan, lips detached from his lips and making small kisses down his jaw onto his neck. He found the soft flesh of Dan&rsquo;s neck and nipped at it with his teeth a bit before sucking onto the sensitive skin. Dan moaned out, reaching his hand out and placing it on the back of Phil&rsquo;s neck to hold him in place.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil loved this. The taste of Dan&rsquo;s skin on his tongue was like a delicacy that he couldn&rsquo;t get enough of. He pulled back and moved a bit lower, attaching his lips to Dan&rsquo;s collarbone.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan squirmed under him as he whimpered and continued to whine at the sensations. Phil honestly felt a bit drunk off from the pheromones Dan was giving off to him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe pulled away, moving his head back so he could connect their lips once more. It was a bit sloppy and a bit messy and Phil was sure their teeth might have clashed but he didn&rsquo;t care. Anything with Dan was amazing and nothing would ever destroy that mindset for him.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil&rsquo;s hips instinctively rolled down, looking for friction to serve as relief for the heat pooling in his lower body and his cock springing to full hardness. He could feel Dan&rsquo;s under him, the hard outline of his own cock jutting into his hip.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you okay with this?&rdquo; Phil asked, looking for consent given how open and vulnerable Dan was just ten or so minutes ago.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nodded quickly and practically begged. &ldquo;Yes! Please keep going and don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nodded to Dan&rsquo;s command and reached his hand between them, fishing his cock out of his pajama pants and letting it spring free between them. Dan reached between them and Phil felt his hand down the same and then Dan&rsquo;s hips cantered up and suddenly, Phil&rsquo;s vision went white.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHis head tipped down and found solace in the crevice between Dan&rsquo;s neck and shoulder as he let of a loud moan. Dan&rsquo;s hand wrapped around both of them and began to stroke as Phil&rsquo;s hips rolled forward on their own accord.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s never done this before. He&rsquo;s never felt the sensation of his already painful erection being stroked along someone else. The feeling of it was enough to send shivers of heat down his spine as he struggled to remain in control of his movements.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe picked his head up and looked down at Dan who was smiling lazily up at him. Phil quickly reached down and pushed Dan&rsquo;s hand out of the way as he took over, stroking them to his tempo and his speed.&nbsp;</p><p>\tIt was over far quicker than he would have liked to admit, shooting white over Dan&rsquo;s stomach and dribbling a bit over Dan&rsquo;s cock. Dan finished not long after, quickly shoving Phil out of the way as he stroked himself to completion and then fell back into a heap on the bed.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan got out of bed first to grab them something to clean up with and when he came back with a damp cloth, Phil gently used it to clean off his hand as he tucked himself back into his pajamas.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan yawned on last time before he settled into bed and leaned over, kissing Phil a few more times with quick little pecks against his lips before settling down onto Phil&rsquo;s chest.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Dan whispered, just as Phil felt himself drifting off to sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;For making me feel like a normal person.&rdquo; Dan says, his voice soft. &ldquo;For actually making me feel loved and not like you&rsquo;re using me to say you got to sleep with the famous Dan Howell.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Dan pressed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan fell asleep not long after the conversation ended and Phil was left, laying back on the bed with his eyes wide open now as he processed Dan&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThank you for actually making me feel loved.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe mere thought of someone not doing that or showing that to Dan made him actually hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSleep took a while to come that night.&nbsp;</p>",
