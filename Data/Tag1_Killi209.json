The scene is clearly meant to suggest eroticism and desire between both Eve and Villanelle. The music most clearly reflects this, as it starts off slow and a bit eerie, but slowly builds louder as Eve puts on the whole outfit. The fervor with which Eve strips down to put on the clothing gifted to her shows the desire she has for her romanticized version of Villanelle. Additionally, Villanelle seems to reflect this desire, as all the clothing she has picked out for Eve looks as though it was custom made for her body. Eve realizes this too as shown by the camera panning over Eve\u2019s butt and breasts as she runs her hands slowly over the dress. The way the camera pans over Eve\u2019s body as she dresses gives the scene a voyeuristic feeling, as if the viewer shouldn\u2019t be there, which contribute to the sense viewers get that Eve knows her desires are misplaced, but she cannot help it nonetheless. Overall, the scene strengthens the continuous theme of a fatal attraction between Eve and Villanelle because we know that the two women will never be together in any sort of normal relationship. The fact that it is the dress that is touching Eve, rather than Villanelle herself, reflects this idea that there will always have to be a distance between the two. </p><p>- giselle</p>",

                "content": "<p>In our last class, we heavily discussed the extent to which <i>Killing Eve</i>&rsquo;s characters follow the &ldquo;psycho-lesbian&rdquo; trope. At the time, I argued that I didn&rsquo;t think that these characters&rsquo; queerness was explicitly attached to their psychopathic tendencies, but watching these last two episodes has altered my perception a bit.</p><p>Firstly, with Villanelle, these episodes further entangle her sexuality with her assassin motives. We see this when we learn of her pattern of castrating male victims as well as her jealousy towards Anna&rsquo;s husband because she says Anna only loved him for his penis. We also see Eve piecing together that Villanelle may have castrated her first victim because he assaulted her.

And I not mean just the main ones, although Villanelle and Eve are amazing, but the others, too. They are so human, charismatic and relatable - Bill, Konstantin, Caroline, Kenny and of course my favorite (right after Villanelle) - Irina. I wish they didn&rsquo;t kill Bill and Konstantin, though T__T</p><p>- The dynamic is great - honestly, it&rsquo;s like pure fanfiction (and I mean it in a good sense), only on screen x) It&rsquo;s the second fanfiction tv-show that I&rsquo;ve watched (the first is Hannibal, ofc), and I&rsquo;m all aboard with this. Gay power to the case-shows X)) I love it.</p><p>- The finale! Eve, dear, you took the definition of Gay Panic to the whole next level xD</p><p>- The humor.

At first she calmly explores the apartment, but as she discovers the apartment\u2019s excesses (champagne bottles in the fridge, designer clothes) she begins to take out the energy that she has been expending for months on finding Villanelle on the physical apartment. Throughout the season, she has begun to explore wild and destructive energy; for example, when she smashes the glass at the bus stop. Her recklessness in destroying her previous life as she pursues the case starts to mirror Villanelle\u2019s obsessive and destructive energy.\u00a0</p><p>In the final scene, Villanelle and Eve come face to face for the first time.

Eve asks Villanelle what she is looking for out of life, and Villanelle says she wants\u00a0\u201cnormal things\u201d, running counter to what audiences might expect. This scene is the most obvious manifestation of their attraction to one another, as well as the conflation of lesbian sexuality and criminality. Eve says that she\u2019s never done anything like this before, and Villanelle says that she can show Eve what to do, then Eve stabs Villanelle in the stomach with a knife. The choice of the knife itself is interesting; the show\u2019s writers could have chosen another, less phallic weapon, but I think that the knife is a deliberate choice to physically demonstrate the arousal and sexual tension in the situation. The phrase\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this before\u201d takes on a dual meaning, both sexual and violent; Villanelle has shown Eve how to be lesbian and violent at the same time.\u00a0</p>",

It&rsquo;s feminist narrative is so refreshing, and something that we don&rsquo;t see enough of on screen.</p><p>Which is why the body shaming jokes it frequently makes are so grating. It makes sense with Villanelle&rsquo;s character that she would be so harsh about people&rsquo;s appearance - she&rsquo;s a psychopath, after all. However, the show seems to support Villanelle&rsquo;s put downs because all the fat characters seen on screen are lazy, given almost no lines and shown as physically unattractive to the point of repulsion. </p><p>Strikingly, all these characters are women. (Think of Inga, Konstantin&rsquo;s off screen wife) The only member of the main cast that isn&rsquo;t skinny is Konstantin himself (and possibly Bill, but he doesn&rsquo;t last long), and he is still portrayed as attractive despite being of a different body type to Carolyn (his former love interest). </p><p>It&rsquo;s such a shame the show is pointing fun at fat women when it strives so hard in other aspects to portray women as more three dimensional than the roles prescribed to them by the male gaze. </p>",
