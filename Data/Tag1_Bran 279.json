He could see ghosts from an earlier age than either of his spirit-seeing siblings, ever since a random but severe infant sickness left him blind in one eye. He learned to slip his skin as a very young child, sharing the bodies of the crows and ravens that flitted about the castle. When he met and bonded with Summer, Bloodraven proclaimed him ready for more advanced training.</p><p>With help from his tutor, the singers of the song of earth, and the Green Men, Bran learned how to enter weirwood trees and view the past, the present, and even a few glimpses of the future. He saw the first human being set foot in the North, watched Torrhen Stark argue with Brandon Snow, and, at Arya&rsquo;s insistence, viewed Nymeria&rsquo;s landing in Dorne. Unfortunately, not even Bran is strong enough to peer through the veil that the Others have somehow placed on the first Long Night and the Night&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s reign.</p><p>He is no longer allowed to look up the truth behind his favorite spooky stories, not after watching the Rat King butcher the prince gave him nightmares for almost a moon.</p><p>They&rsquo;re teaching him other things, too: how to carve and care for the trees, how to forge candles of glass, how to (sort of) interpret his prophetic dreams, how to craft illusions with bits of obsidian and peoples&rsquo; expectations, how to make ridiculously good shots despite his impaired vision (because let&rsquo;s face it, Bloodraven was a famously good archer despite having only one eye and no depth perception. He prooooobably used at least a little magic for some of his more famous shots). Luwin is teaching him herb-craft and healing. Bran does very well in his lessons, and his teachers are already planning what they&rsquo;re going to teach him as he grows older. They&rsquo;re looking forward to it.</p><p>Not all of Bran&rsquo;s lessons are esoteric. Like the rest of his family, he&rsquo;s learning how to rule and wield weapons. He probably isn&rsquo;t going to use a lot of that, but it&rsquo;s always better to be safe than sorry, especially since his elder brother is almost certainly going to be in the thick of things.</p><p>Bran&rsquo;s best friend is Jojen Reed, one of the highborn students of the Academy. It always makes Ned smile to see them together. He&rsquo;s less thrilled about Bran&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;secret&rdquo; plan to make Jojen and Arya fall in love so they can be good-brothers, even is a tiny part of him sort of hopes it succeeds.</p><p>Despite his many talents, Bran is not particularly interested in espionage. Bloodraven sort of hopes that this will change as he gets older, but, well, there&rsquo;s always Arya.</p><p>In short, Bran is a talented young sorcerer-in-training who fully intends to live up to his potential without losing his humanity.</p></p>",
