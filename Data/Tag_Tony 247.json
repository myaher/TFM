Steve had been in the corridor, waiting for Tony to be done and stood up when the man approached him. Tony skipped a bit, as if trying to find back his balance after hours on high heels and looked tired, but happy. His shows always attracted a lot of people and he loved the attention.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Did you like my new song?&rdquo; Tony asked as he locked his arms together with Steve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Wrote it for you,&rdquo; he added in a flirting tone, batting his eyelashes, which still were long, even without the fake ones attached.</p><p><i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s time in time with your time and its news is captured. For the queen to use.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Steve smiled, remembering the song. It was mellow and more carefree than what usually Tony sang. Steve wouldn&rsquo;t dare to say that it had a cheerful and subtle country note, but it reminded him a bit of that.</p><p>&ldquo;I liked the &rsquo;<i>diddit diddit didda&rsquo; part,</i>&rdquo; Steve admitted, as cold night air surrounded them when they walked through the back door of the club and into the street.</p><p>Tony made a face and stuck his tongue out. &ldquo;Should have known. Why I even try for you.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t have more occasions to complain as Steve turned to him and fitted a hand on the brunet&rsquo;s cheek, leaning down for a kiss. A sweet, brush of lips, becoming more heated with time in the dark, empty street. The soft lips tasted like the cherry flavored lips gloss Red Velvet liked to use.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. I guess that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; Tony chuckled and fluttered his eyes in delight when the kiss ended. Steve only smiled cheekily, proving his point.</p><p>&ldquo;Any plans for the rest of the night?&rdquo; Steve asked, putting both hands on Tony&rsquo;s hips and swaying with him. &ldquo;Wanna grab a bite?&rdquo; a shared late night meal after Red Velvet&rsquo;s show became one of their rituals.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Tony hesitated, rubbing at his shorter goatee. The skin itched a little bit after hours of being covered in latex. &ldquo;I was thinking that maybe tonight I will take you to my place? Maybe we could spend the weekend together,&rdquo; he added, suddenly sounding shy.</p><p>Steve stared at Tony in surprise. In their almost a month dating time, neither of them ever been to the other&rsquo;s place. Steve already felt like barging into Tony&rsquo;s space and wanted to slow things down a bit and get to know each other better before taking that step. Seemed that Tony had different plans for them. It was something comforting and intimate about it and made him feel all happy inside. Trusting his gut feeling, he decided to go with it.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. I would love to,&rdquo; Steve said softly and they began walking to the parking lot, chatting excitedly. It was surprising how easy everything was going for them, and Steve loved how open Tony could be about everything. It was a nice change in his life.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my car,&rdquo; Tony stopped and took out a set of car keys, pressing on the button and making the orange Audi flash its lights.</p><p>&ldquo;Orange?&rdquo; Steve asked in humor, not imagining that Tony would ever choose an orange car. Black. Red. Some dark color. But orange? &ldquo;You really like to attract attention,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, it was a bet,&rdquo; Tony explained, getting in and motioning for Steve to do the same. Once they settled in, he continued. &ldquo;My friend, Rhodey, once told me that no one looks good in orange. So, I bought an orange car to prove him wrong,&rdquo; he ended the story on a lighthearted note, and Steve had to think for a while what was Tony&rsquo;s day job that he could afford a new car, just to win a bet. &ldquo;Seat belts,&rdquo; Tony reminded, waiting for Steve to fasten his seat belts.</p><p>&ldquo;Does your friend know that you are&mdash;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A drag queen? Yeah, he knows. We had this talk when I once wanted to wear an orange dress and he tried to talk me out of it. The whole joke is that, that he looks great in orange, just doesn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; Tony laughed, making sure that the road behind them was clear before he drove out of the parking and into the street.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a long ride, and it was quite pleasant, with the road being almost empty and the distance seemed shorter to Steve. Tony&rsquo;s apartment was in one of those new building, and it was in pristine condition, and everything was sparkling clean and neatly organized and had more of a hotel vibe than a home feeling to it. Tony handed Steve some clean towels and a toothbrush, and even lend him a shirt and pants to sleep in. They both were tired after a long week and soon collapsed on Tony&rsquo;s king-sized bed, sharing a goodnight kiss and nothing more, not having strength.</p><p>Morning was a whole different story.</p><p>***</p><p>Steve always woke up early. It was how his body was functioning and he came to terms with it a long time ago. And Steve really loved mornings. He loved how quiet it was and how he could plan his day in peace before the usual chaos started. Today, he didn&rsquo;t have any plans. He stayed in bed, laying on his side, with his head propped on one hand and watched Tony sleeping, taking in every second. The sun just started to rise and fill the white apartment with sunlight and Tony looked absolutely gorgeous. He was on his back, arms placed over his head in a carefree manner and some cute curls were falling on his forehead. His skin had some divine glow to it, and his lips seemed moist and plump and invitingly wet and shiny\u2026</p><p>Wait, shiny?</p><p>Something didn&rsquo;t add up.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Steve whispered, aware that he might be wrong and if that was the case, he didn&rsquo;t want to disturb the other&rsquo;s sleep. &ldquo;Are you wearing makeup?&rdquo; he asked, recognizing the blush color Tony used as Red Velvet.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came a quick answer, too quick and delivered in a fully awake voice, and Tony cringed, realizing that he gave himself away. Steve smiled broadly and did the only reasonable things - he grabbed the edge of the white covers and strongly rubbed it over brunet&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Tony immediately protested and lowered his hands to push away the material. &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long until Steve was satisfied with his job and threw the smudged covers away, getting off the layers of foundation, blushes, and highlighters. What was left, was Tony&rsquo;s skin, natural and tanned and soft, showing some laugh lines and shadows under his eyes. The whole carefully planned look was gone and yet\u2026</p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful,&rdquo; Steve said in an honest voice, finding Tony even more breathtaking than before.</p><p>Tony groaned and threw arms over his face, covering himself. &ldquo;I hate you and your young, smooth skin,&rdquo; he grunted, sounding embarrassed. The age difference between them wasn&rsquo;t so big to start with, but sometimes Tony felt more bothered by it.</p><p>Steve gently lowered Tony&rsquo;s arms, feeling happiness growing in him when the other man allowed that and leaned down to kiss the tip of his nose. It was silly and sweet and Tony giggled, his eyes and nose crinkling at the simple affection.</p><p>&ldquo;You know since we are both awake already\u2026&rdquo; Steve hummed, rubbing their noses together. Tony didn&rsquo;t need to hear it twice and wrapped arms around Steve&rsquo;s neck, holding him in place and pushing his hips up to match Steve&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Tony gasped, feeling a distinctive hardness on Steve&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Hm. I guess having a younger lover has its perks,&rdquo; Tony giggled and Steve quieted him down with more kisses.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;It is a filthy habit and I hope you know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony only smiled contrarily, standing on the shadow part of the balcony in a silk, white night robe that ended just an inch below his round butt. It would be a very tempting picture if he wasn&rsquo;t smoking, blowing the smoke out in small circles as if to rile up Steve more. It was just funny to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking we could eat outside, but you ruined it,&rdquo; Steve continued to complain, beating egg whites for omelets. He already cut up some fresh fruits for a fruit salad, made freshly squeezed orange juice and had chopped mushroom and sweet bell peppers on hand, ready to toss in the eggs mixture when needed. It was quite amazing how well stocked in fresh vegetables and fruits Tony&rsquo;s kitchen was.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad,&rdquo; Tony said, not sounding apologetic at all. He stepped into the kitchen, bringing the stinging scent of cigarettes with him. &ldquo;Besides, such a great morning required a smoke. I am glad I am not performing today, I don&rsquo;t think I can walk on heels,&rdquo; he tried to joke and kiss Steve on the neck, but was stopped by blond&rsquo;s stern look.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it, unless you brush your teeth,&rdquo; Steve said, sounding serious.</p><p>Tony whistled, but obediently walked to the bathroom. &ldquo;You know, if I was wearing a dress, you wouldn&rsquo;t use that tone towards me!&rdquo; he yelled, reminding Steve of their first meeting outside the club. Steve was too stunned back then and it was no opening line to call someone out on smoking, but after almost a month of dating, he felt he earned the right.</p><p>Steve just smiled, hearing as Tony started to brush his teeth, considering it a win.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, wanna go shopping with me later?&rdquo; Tony asked, finishing his omelet. It was a fluffy heaven and Tony loved Steve for adding some chopped ham into it. Delicious.</p><p>&ldquo;Shopping?&rdquo; Steve repeated, putting a portion of the fruit salad into a bowl and handing it to Tony, who smiled gratefully at him. It was endearing how eating made Tony happy. Steve would later try to talk him out of his habit of starving himself before his shows. Tony looked great anyway. &ldquo;But you are fully stocked,&rdquo; Steve said, meaning the full fridge and pantry, not imagining what else he might need.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean grocery shopping,&rdquo; Tony said, clearing his plate and digging into the fruit salad. Steve even made some watermelon and melon balls. Adorable. &ldquo;I need to replenish my supplies. For my night work.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve watched Tony eat, almost greedily devouring the chopped fruits. Suddenly the images from the movies flooded his mind, the ones of bored husbands waiting in the changing room, as their wives tried on numerous dresses, presenting themselves to their partners, whose enthusiasms kept dropping with every new outfit, opposite to the women&rsquo;s who took energy from trying on more clothes. He could picture himself doing that with Tony while being more enthusiastic, of course, and it was a tempting image, one that made his heart beat faster.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Steve nodded, feeling that they both would enjoy that. He sampled the fruit salad and scrunched his nose. &ldquo;Needs some honey,&rdquo; he stated, finding it not enough sweet.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it is great,&rdquo; Tony smiled, really enjoying the meal.</p><p>&ldquo;It will be better if we drizzle some honey on it, trust me,&rdquo; Steve said, standing up, &ldquo;you have honey?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes playfully. Seemed that Steve was the master of breakfasts and everything had to be perfect. For Tony, it was tasty as it was, but he could humor him. &ldquo;Cabinet on the left,&rdquo; he said, putting a piece of banana in his mouth and almost spitting it out in panic. &ldquo;NO! The other left!&rdquo; Tony called, but it already happened. Steve opened the cabinet and jumped to the back when the contents spilled, falling in a mess to the countertop and to the floor.</p><p>Steve stared in shock. Tony felt like crawling under the table.</p><p>The concept of snacks wasn&rsquo;t strange to Steve. Heck, back in his apartment in his own pantry, he always kept a stack of animal crackers for the days he felt nostalgic, and always had on hand a bag of salted potato chips to have something to snack on during watching TV. Having snacks was perfectly normal. But this\u2026 This was numerous bags of pretzel sticks, potato chips in five different flavors, pop tarts, sugary cereals\u2026 Clearly hidden away. And so the abundance of fresh products finally became clear.</p><p>&ldquo;This is what you usually eat?!&rdquo; Steve asked, taking in his hands a box of frosted cornflakes.</p><p>Tony groaned, almost sliding off the chair. &ldquo;In my defense, you were not supposed to see this,&rdquo; he said, sounding and looking embarrassed.</p><p>This situation could lead to many different outcomes, but the one Tony didn&rsquo;t expect was that, that Steve would start to laugh. And he was laughing, loud and clear, as hearing the best joke ever.</p><p>&ldquo;This is great,&rdquo; Steve kept laughing, tossing the box in the air, before catching it. &ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony asked, not feeling as much embarrassed as angry. Steve had too much fun in his discomfort.</p><p>&ldquo;This whole time, I thought that you were some out of this world, divine creature who is way out of my league, but you have flaws! This is great news!&rdquo; Steve continued to laugh, putting the cornflakes aside and smiling at Tony. Every time he saw Red Velvet on stage, he was completely mesmerized - her make up was flawless, she never stumbled and her voice was always clear while singing, not a single false note. She was perfect. And here he was learning that the guy under Red Velvet&rsquo;s makeup was a regular human being who liked to binge on junk food and felt insecure from time to time. In Steve&rsquo;s eyes, both Tony and Red Velvet were perfect the way they were. Tony, with his stunning appearance and wit and intelligence, had some imperfections deeply rooted in him, but they made him tangible and close. Red Velvet was a dream, but Tony was the real thing.</p><p>Somehow, Tony didn&rsquo;t share the enthusiasm and just looked confused.</p><p>&ldquo;So\u2026 You are not disappointed in me?&rdquo; he asked, genuinely surprised. It would be so heartbreaking that Tony could be so insecure if the circumstances weren&rsquo;t so hilarious.</p><p>&ldquo;No! Of course not!&rdquo; Steve quickly assured, taking Tony&rsquo;s hand in his. &ldquo;I am just glad that I finally have a proof that you are a human being,&rdquo; he continued to laugh.</p><p>Tony grimaced, needing to come clean about one more thing. &ldquo;And what if I told you, that I ordered a cleaning company just to make my apartment presentable for you?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve stopped laughing. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just alarming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, I wanted to make a good first impression,&rdquo; Tony ducked his head down, feeling embarrassed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me, you make a great first impression,&rdquo; Steve smiled in all honesty, remembering how he had been twice stunned by Tony. First, with him as Red Velvet in the club, and then in the diner, when he showed up as himself. The first impressions were what made Steve want to meet him, but it was the things that he was learning now, that made him want to stay. &ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; he asked when Tony still refused to look up. &ldquo;Come on, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Reluctantly, Tony did so. There was still a blush on his face and Steve was sure, it wasn&rsquo;t makeup this time. A whole lot of insecurities in the brown eyes. This was so much different from when Tony was Red Velvet. Poised and strong and confident. And Steve loved them both. He wanted to be there for Tony in his strongest moments and his most vulnerable. All the time.</p><p>Words were not needed, but actions. When they kissed, it tasted tangy and delicious. And Tony was right, the fruit salad didn&rsquo;t need any honey, it was already sweet as it was.</p><p>***</p><p>The mall was crowded as usual on the weekends and Steve was surprised that they ended in the mall anyway. He expected that Tony would take him to some small shop, outside the city, where they could have all the privacy they wanted. But how it turned out, he misunderstood Tony&rsquo;s offer completely.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah,&rdquo; Steve nodded, walking after Tony into the crowded shop. It had a black sign above with the name of the shop in white, bold print and the shelves were in dark, almost black color, big signs above every cabinet indicating what products you could find. Steve guessed that the black interior was supposed to emphasize more the multicolored stock. In one hundred years, Steve wouldn&rsquo;t guess that Tony would take him to a handmade cosmetic shop. That&rsquo;s what he meant by restocking his supplies for the show. Makeup.</p><p>&ldquo;And it is all organic too!&rdquo; Tony chirped enthusiastically, rubbing some gray goop into his wrist and putting near Steve&rsquo;s nose to smell. It was a bit sweet, but also an earthy smell.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Steve asked, eyeing suspiciously a table with a tub filled with ice with different colored goops in huge containers placed on top.</p><p>&ldquo;Facial mask. This one is blueberry and chamomile oil. It calms the skin and makes it more radiant. I am gonna need some of it, but we will take it as the last thing, it needs to stay cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve felt a note of panic. Last thing\u2026?</p><p>&ldquo;Steve! Keep up, please! We have a lot of things to buy!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve gritted his teeth. He threw on a brave face and trotted after Tony, holding in his hand the shopping basket.</p><p>Nourishing serum for the night. Moisturizer for the day with jojoba oil. A shampoo bar, thing Steve didn&rsquo;t even know that existed, that smelled like berries. It was just the beginning and the basket was filling up, as Tony was going from stand to stand, choosing his favorites, sometimes turning to Steve and asking him to smell things. Soon every scent started to mingle into a one, aromatic ball of perfume and he felt a beginning of a headache.</p><p>&ldquo;And this is my favorite stand!&rdquo; Tony spread his arms, standing in front of the wall with baskets filled up to the brim with colorful orbs. &ldquo;Bath bombs!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve asked, not being one to complain, but his arm started to hurt. Maybe he should have taken two baskets.</p><p>&ldquo;Bath bombs. You drop this into a bathtub and it fizzes and the water turns colorful and scented and amazing. You need to try one!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a bathtub,&rdquo; Steve said, finding himself more of a shower kind of person. Soaking in water for hours was not for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Luckily, I have a one,&rdquo; Tony said lightly, rummaging in one of the baskets, &ldquo;and it can fit in two people. You always want to take the ones that are on the bottom, they are the freshest,&rdquo; Tony said before the first sentence had a chance to sink in Steve&rsquo;s mind. Taking a bath with Tony sounded like a nice reward after this ordeal. &ldquo;You will love this one.&rdquo;</p><p>Another thing to smell. Steve faked a smile and moved closer, taking a sniff of the ball in milky blue color with the shop&rsquo;s name stamped on it. It wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It smelled sweet and subtle.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Steve asked, genuinely curious for a change.</p><p>&ldquo;Vanilla and orange blossom. I had a feeling you will like it,&rdquo; Tony smiled, adding the bath bomb to the pile in the basket.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>America&rsquo;s Sweetheart</i>. Really, Tony?&rdquo; Steve asked dryly, reading the name of the bath bomb.</p><p>Tony cooed and blew a kissy face in Steve&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;This is my favorite one,&rdquo; he said, turning back to the baskets and taking out another bomb and putting it close to Steve. It was red with white swirls and looked like it had some glitter in it, with a stamped crown on it. Steve smelled it and the fragrance was a bit stronger than the previous bomb but still pleasant. It reminded him of sweet, red apples. He read the name tag and couldn&rsquo;t help but to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Evil Queen</i>?&rdquo; he asked Tony. Someone had to have a blast coming up with all those names.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Villains have much more interesting lives than heroes. And I am definitely a queen,&rdquo; Tony joked, flopping some curls near his ear away in a playful manner.</p><p>Steve could just agree with a smile and then followed his queen on the adventure in the cosmetic shop, as the loyal knight he was.</p><p>***</p><p>The shop wasn&rsquo;t big, yet Steve felt like it was enormous. He lost count of time and felt that his back and feet started to ache, and the strong smells were starting to irritate him. He considered asking Tony if he could wait outside, but he didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the moment. It was just really getting hard for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Steve, quick question!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve turned his tired eyes to Tony, really hoping that the question was &rsquo;&lt;do you want to wait outside for me?&rsquo; By the way Tony was smiling, Steve could already say that it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;What color is better for me - this one, or this one?&rdquo; Tony asked, holding in his hands two lipsticks. He was trying to hide it, but his lips were twitching into a mocking smile, almost as if he planned to torment Steve with the task.</p><p>The joke was on him, though.</p><p>Steve put down the basket and took the two lipsticks, turning more to the light. For the inexperienced eye, both lipsticks seemed red. Steve saw the subtle differences. One was a bold, cherry color, the other a deep, rosy red. One was matt finish, the other sparkly finish.</p><p>&ldquo;I think both will look great on you,&rdquo; Steve said, and Tony almost whooped in excitement, pleased that Steve walked into such an obvious trap, &ldquo;but you usually wear sparkling materials, so it is better to go with a matte finish, to not overpower the dress. And the rose color will go better with your skin tone, than the cherry one.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony listened, staring at Steve. It all made sense and it was quite frightening.</p><p>Steve smiled, feeling that he had an upper hand in this matter and handed two lipsticks back to Tony. &ldquo;I work in an art supply store, Tony. I can tell shades of red apart,&rdquo; he explained, sounding smug and Tony smiled cheekily.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you full of surprises,&rdquo; he purred out playfully and put the samples away. He added the rose lipstick into the basket and that made Steve feel a bit proud. Steve hoped that it would be the end for today, but Tony just trotted away to find more products.</p><p>&ldquo;Stevie?&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, Steve knew this voice. He turned around.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma?!&rdquo; he gasped, suddenly finding himself in a new situation, one that had written DANGER all over.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, honey!&rdquo; Sarah Rogers, Steve&rsquo;s mom, smiled at her son. She had blond hair and blue eyes, something Steve had inherited from her and had a petite frame. Steve had to lean down when she walked over to kiss her son&rsquo;s cheek as hello.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma, what are you doing here?&rdquo; Steve asked, suddenly very aware that he was in a cosmetic shop and that he didn&rsquo;t belong here, while his mom did.</p><p>&ldquo;And what everyone is doing here? Just a little shopping,&rdquo; she said, pointing Steve&rsquo;s attention to the few products in her basket. Her eyes widened when she saw Steve&rsquo;s brimming one. &ldquo;Or not so little,&rdquo; she said, looking confused when she noticed a lipstick displayed proudly on top and other makeup products Tony had recently picked.</p><p>Steve felt his face blushing and looked at his shoes in panic. He had no clue how to explain this all.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, this won&rsquo;t be so easy! Which blush, this one or this one?&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>Steve completely froze. Please, not now.</p><p>Tony was quick to asses the situation. He saw the family resemblance and put on a charming smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi! I am Tony,&rdquo; he said in a pleasant voice, waving his hand, &ldquo;you must be Steve&rsquo;s mom. Your son looks very similar to you, Mrs. Rogers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, call me Sarah,&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s mom replied, quickly warming up to Tony. That unfroze Steve a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma, Tony is&mdash;&rdquo; and Steve&rsquo;s voice got stuck again. Who? Who is Tony? A drag queen? My boyfriend? God, they never even discussed who they were for each other. Steve&rsquo;s mind whirred in panic.</p><p>&ldquo;A makeup artist,&rdquo; Tony came up with a smooth lie, which wasn&rsquo;t really a lie. &ldquo;Steve helps me to restock,&rdquo; Tony explained, and Steve only nodded, not finding his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;A makeup artist? I didn&rsquo;t wear any makeup in a long time,&rdquo; Sarah admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really have to, with your porcelain skin and beautiful cheekbones!&rdquo; Tony praised enthusiastically and Sarah laughed. Steve looked at Tony in panic. What the heck was happening. &ldquo;But if you would like to try a little bit of makeup, I will be happy to help. I have some time, and I could assist you. Think of me as your personal makeup artist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to stop you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We would love to accompany you! Right, Steve?&rdquo; still no answer. &ldquo;I know he would,&rdquo; Tony decided in Steve&rsquo;s name and took Sarah&rsquo;s basket, handing it to Steve. &ldquo;Make yourself useful, huh?&rdquo; he whispered to Steve, and the sore tone he used grounded Steve back. Feeling that he screwed up, he quietly padded after his mom and Tony, holding two baskets, Tony already hooking arms with his mom like if they were best friends, as they were discussing makeup and skin care, and Tony was charming and polite, and Steve acted like an idiot.</p><p>It was a day when Steve spent in a cosmetic shop more time than he would like to admit to, but he didn&rsquo;t notice the time fly, as the whole time he was trying to think what he would tell his mom in the end. What was his relationship with Tony? Calling him his friend seemed too little, and boyfriend was a bold word. Lover was sweet, but could also indicate other things and cause confusion. He didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t have any problems, and even if he had one, he didn&rsquo;t let it show. He made Sarah laugh and joked with her, and was eager to explain every product and find the most suitable ones for her. He even let her use his discount, which was a sweet gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to join us for lunch?&rdquo; Tony asked when the three of them walked out of the shop. He enjoyed Sarah&rsquo;s company, and Steve had a nasty feeling that Tony liked her more than him at this particular moment.</p><p>&ldquo;You are so sweet, Tony,&rdquo; Sarah laughed, and Steve could just silently agree, feeling like a fool. &ldquo;I will leave you boys alone, now. I really want to get home and try that facial mask you recommended to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just remember to gently coat the skin, don&rsquo;t work it in,&rdquo; Tony said, showing on his face to which areas apply the mask. &ldquo;Fifteen minutes is plenty of time to let it sit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know a lot about skincare,&rdquo; Sarah praised, impressed by Tony&rsquo;s knowledge.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Tony fluttered his long eyelashes playfully, taking the compliment with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;It was lovely seeing you both,&rdquo; Sarah turned to Steve and Steve leaned down on automat, letting his mom kiss his cheek. Then she turned to Tony and granted him with the same motherly affection.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Sarah!&rdquo; Tony said, waving to Steve&rsquo;s mom with a smile, as she began to walk away.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, ma,&rdquo; Steve said quietly, feeling like hiding into the floor. When his mom mingled with the crowd, Tony slid his arm under Steve&rsquo;s and urged him to walk.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, we have like forty-five minutes to get back before I have to put the facial masks in the fridge. Now when I think about it, we actually don&rsquo;t have the time to eat, maybe takeaway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm, how about some fried rice? Or maybe sushi! Do you like sushi? I could eat some crab&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Steve stopped, making someone behind him almost collided into his back. There was some angry cursing, but Steve didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to it.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony also stopped, widening his eyes. &ldquo;Not in the mood for sushi?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve rubbed his face. It was almost as if Tony had planned to let his guilt consume him and ignore the topic.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, about what happened\u2026 I am sorry, I went so silent, I just&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it is okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is?&rdquo; Steve asked, looking confused at Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Tony shrugged, not considering it a big deal. &ldquo;I understand. Really.&rdquo;</p><p>It was supposed to be comforting, but something in the tone of Tony&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t seem right.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what do you understand?&rdquo; Steve asked, feeling that they might be not on the same page.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand you not telling your mom who I am. It is okay. Your mom is a sweet lady, but I think that hearing that her son is hanging out with a drag queen is beyond her limits.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh no. This was much worse than Steve thought.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not ashamed of being with you!&rdquo; Steve yelled, attracting some attention to them. Tony blinked, slightly taken aback.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; Tony asked, his voice sounding a bit cold.</p><p>&ldquo;God, Tony,&rdquo; Steve rubbed his face again. &ldquo;I just panicked, okay? It doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything with you being who you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is complicated. I never told my mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yhm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And we never discussed it, you know? We keep seeing each other, but I don&rsquo;t know what it makes us&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, back in my days, if you kissed and slept with someone on a regular and exclusive basis, it made you date them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve stared.</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, not in the playful, dramatic way he used to sometimes, but as if he really considered Steve dense. &ldquo;Dating? You know, two people meeting with each other? I know that gay people have an opinion of sleeping around, but I always was a fan of monogamy once I am in relationship with someone, so correct me if I am wrong, because maybe it is just one-sided and I would like to know if it is&mdash;&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s blabbing was interrupted, when Steve pressed him close and quietened with a kiss. In the middle of the mall. With people passing by. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but blush.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, well,&rdquo; Tony said when Steve let him go, looking adorably shy. &ldquo;Back in my days, people tried to stay more covert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but times change,&rdquo; Steve shrugged, hooking their arms together and walking with Tony to the food court, his steps lighter than ever. &ldquo;And I hate raw fish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fried rice then,&rdquo; Tony decided, still feeling a bit weak in the knees after the kiss. But it felt good. As if they made it official. It felt even more than good.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready for this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We really have to do this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, it is just the two of us. I won&rsquo;t tell anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I won&rsquo;t do it, you will pester me until I agree, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know me so well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. Let&rsquo;s be over with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiled, putting his fingers into the container and getting some gray goop out. He rubbed it between his palms and carefully applied to Steve&rsquo;s whole face.</p><p>&ldquo;Your skin will thank me later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah\u2026&rdquo; Steve griped, although it did feel kinda nice. Cooling. And the smell was nice too.</p><p>&ldquo;There. Now do me,&rdquo; Tony handed Steve the container, smiling adorably. Steve repeated what Tony did to him, careful to not coat any unruly hair trying to make their way out of the headband. He was with Tony in his bathroom, somehow agreeing to a home spa evening. &ldquo;Should I put it on your beard?&rdquo; Steve asked, unsure what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just try to work it in the skin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said to not work it in the skin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only when you have a smooth face. Like yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be jealous once I grow a beard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like how you look now.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled, sensing the honesty in Tony&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;And I like how you look now,&rdquo; he booped Tony on the nose playfully, meaning the tiny bathrobe and nothing else underneath. Steve&rsquo;s outfit was even skimpier as it consisted only of a towel around his hips.</p><p>Tony giggled, and it was a cute reaction he always had whenever Steve kissed or tapped on his nose. Almost as if the tip of his nose was ticklish.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready for your first bath bomb bath?&rdquo; Tony asked excitedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Steve kept smiling because Tony looked so happy. It was somehow contagious.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to be &rsquo;<i>America&rsquo;s sweetheart</i> or <i>The Evil Queen</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about both? Can we do that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhmmm. We can try. I just hope my bathtub won&rsquo;t explode.&rdquo;</p><p>In the end, Steve had to admit that home spa evenings were not so bad.

Steve had been in the corridor, waiting for Tony to be done and stood up when the man approached him. Tony skipped a bit, as if trying to find back his balance after hours on high heels and looked tired, but happy. His shows always attracted a lot of people and he loved the attention.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDid you like my new song?\u201d Tony asked as he locked his arms together with Steve\u2019s. \u201cWrote it for you,\u201d he added in a flirting tone, batting his eyelashes, which still were long, even without the fake ones attached.</p><p><i>\u201c\u2018Cause it\u2019s time, it\u2019s time in time with your time and its news is captured. For the queen to use.\u201d</i></p><p>Steve smiled, remembering the song. It was mellow and more carefree than what usually Tony sang. Steve wouldn\u2019t dare to say that it had a cheerful and subtle country note, but it reminded him a bit of that.</p><p>\u201cI liked the \u2019<i>diddit diddit didda\u2019 part,</i>\u201d Steve admitted, as cold night air surrounded them when they walked through the back door of the club and into the street.</p><p>Tony made a face and stuck his tongue out. \u201cShould have known. Why I even try for you.\u201d He didn\u2019t have more occasions to complain as Steve turned to him and fitted a hand on the brunet\u2019s cheek, leaning down for a kiss. A sweet, brush of lips, becoming more heated with time in the dark, empty street. The soft lips tasted like the cherry flavored lips gloss Red Velvet liked to use.</p><p>\u201cMhm. I guess that\u2019s why,\u201d Tony chuckled and fluttered his eyes in delight when the kiss ended. Steve only smiled cheekily, proving his point.</p><p>\u201cAny plans for the rest of the night?\u201d Steve asked, putting both hands on Tony\u2019s hips and swaying with him. \u201cWanna grab a bite?\u201d a shared late night meal after Red Velvet\u2019s show became one of their rituals.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Tony hesitated, rubbing at his shorter goatee. The skin itched a little bit after hours of being covered in latex. \u201cI was thinking that maybe tonight I will take you to my place? Maybe we could spend the weekend together,\u201d he added, suddenly sounding shy.</p><p>Steve stared at Tony in surprise. In their almost a month dating time, neither of them ever been to the other\u2019s place. Steve already felt like barging into Tony\u2019s space and wanted to slow things down a bit and get to know each other better before taking that step. Seemed that Tony had different plans for them. It was something comforting and intimate about it and made him feel all happy inside. Trusting his gut feeling, he decided to go with it.</p><p>\u201cSure. I would love to,\u201d Steve said softly and they began walking to the parking lot, chatting excitedly. It was surprising how easy everything was going for them, and Steve loved how open Tony could be about everything. It was a nice change in his life.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my car,\u201d Tony stopped and took out a set of car keys, pressing on the button and making the orange Audi flash its lights.</p><p>\u201cOrange?\u201d Steve asked in humor, not imagining that Tony would ever choose an orange car. Black. Red. Some dark color. But orange? \u201cYou really like to attract attention,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cActually, it was a bet,\u201d Tony explained, getting in and motioning for Steve to do the same. Once they settled in, he continued. \u201cMy friend, Rhodey, once told me that no one looks good in orange. So, I bought an orange car to prove him wrong,\u201d he ended the story on a lighthearted note, and Steve had to think for a while what was Tony\u2019s day job that he could afford a new car, just to win a bet. \u201cSeat belts,\u201d Tony reminded, waiting for Steve to fasten his seat belts.</p><p>\u201cDoes your friend know that you are\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drag queen? Yeah, he knows. We had this talk when I once wanted to wear an orange dress and he tried to talk me out of it. The whole joke is that, that he looks great in orange, just doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d Tony laughed, making sure that the road behind them was clear before he drove out of the parking and into the street.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a long ride, and it was quite pleasant, with the road being almost empty and the distance seemed shorter to Steve. Tony\u2019s apartment was in one of those new building, and it was in pristine condition, and everything was sparkling clean and neatly organized and had more of a hotel vibe than a home feeling to it. Tony handed Steve some clean towels and a toothbrush, and even lend him a shirt and pants to sleep in. They both were tired after a long week and soon collapsed on Tony\u2019s king-sized bed, sharing a goodnight kiss and nothing more, not having strength.</p><p>Morning was a whole different story.</p><p>***</p><p>Steve always woke up early. It was how his body was functioning and he came to terms with it a long time ago. And Steve really loved mornings. He loved how quiet it was and how he could plan his day in peace before the usual chaos started. Today, he didn\u2019t have any plans. He stayed in bed, laying on his side, with his head propped on one hand and watched Tony sleeping, taking in every second. The sun just started to rise and fill the white apartment with sunlight and Tony looked absolutely gorgeous. He was on his back, arms placed over his head in a carefree manner and some cute curls were falling on his forehead. His skin had some divine glow to it, and his lips seemed moist and plump and invitingly wet and shiny\u2026</p><p>Wait, shiny?</p><p>Something didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Steve whispered, aware that he might be wrong and if that was the case, he didn\u2019t want to disturb the other\u2019s sleep. \u201cAre you wearing makeup?\u201d he asked, recognizing the blush color Tony used as Red Velvet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d came a quick answer, too quick and delivered in a fully awake voice, and Tony cringed, realizing that he gave himself away. Steve smiled broadly and did the only reasonable things - he grabbed the edge of the white covers and strongly rubbed it over brunet\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony immediately protested and lowered his hands to push away the material. \u201cSteve!\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long until Steve was satisfied with his job and threw the smudged covers away, getting off the layers of foundation, blushes, and highlighters. What was left, was Tony\u2019s skin, natural and tanned and soft, showing some laugh lines and shadows under his eyes. The whole carefully planned look was gone and yet\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Steve said in an honest voice, finding Tony even more breathtaking than before.</p><p>Tony groaned and threw arms over his face, covering himself. \u201cI hate you and your young, smooth skin,\u201d he grunted, sounding embarrassed. The age difference between them wasn\u2019t so big to start with, but sometimes Tony felt more bothered by it.</p><p>Steve gently lowered Tony\u2019s arms, feeling happiness growing in him when the other man allowed that and leaned down to kiss the tip of his nose. It was silly and sweet and Tony giggled, his eyes and nose crinkling at the simple affection.</p><p>\u201cYou know since we are both awake already\u2026\u201d Steve hummed, rubbing their noses together. Tony didn\u2019t need to hear it twice and wrapped arms around Steve\u2019s neck, holding him in place and pushing his hips up to match Steve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tony gasped, feeling a distinctive hardness on Steve\u2019s body. \u201cHm. I guess having a younger lover has its perks,\u201d Tony giggled and Steve quieted him down with more kisses.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIt is a filthy habit and I hope you know it.\u201d</p><p>Tony only smiled contrarily, standing on the shadow part of the balcony in a silk, white night robe that ended just an inch below his round butt. It would be a very tempting picture if he wasn\u2019t smoking, blowing the smoke out in small circles as if to rile up Steve more. It was just funny to him.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could eat outside, but you ruined it,\u201d Steve continued to complain, beating egg whites for omelets. He already cut up some fresh fruits for a fruit salad, made freshly squeezed orange juice and had chopped mushroom and sweet bell peppers on hand, ready to toss in the eggs mixture when needed. It was quite amazing how well stocked in fresh vegetables and fruits Tony\u2019s kitchen was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad,\u201d Tony said, not sounding apologetic at all. He stepped into the kitchen, bringing the stinging scent of cigarettes with him. \u201cBesides, such a great morning required a smoke. I am glad I am not performing today, I don\u2019t think I can walk on heels,\u201d he tried to joke and kiss Steve on the neck, but was stopped by blond\u2019s stern look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, unless you brush your teeth,\u201d Steve said, sounding serious.</p><p>Tony whistled, but obediently walked to the bathroom. \u201cYou know, if I was wearing a dress, you wouldn\u2019t use that tone towards me!\u201d he yelled, reminding Steve of their first meeting outside the club. Steve was too stunned back then and it was no opening line to call someone out on smoking, but after almost a month of dating, he felt he earned the right.</p><p>Steve just smiled, hearing as Tony started to brush his teeth, considering it a win.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHey, wanna go shopping with me later?\u201d Tony asked, finishing his omelet. It was a fluffy heaven and Tony loved Steve for adding some chopped ham into it. Delicious.</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d Steve repeated, putting a portion of the fruit salad into a bowl and handing it to Tony, who smiled gratefully at him. It was endearing how eating made Tony happy. Steve would later try to talk him out of his habit of starving himself before his shows. Tony looked great anyway. \u201cBut you are fully stocked,\u201d Steve said, meaning the full fridge and pantry, not imagining what else he might need.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean grocery shopping,\u201d Tony said, clearing his plate and digging into the fruit salad. Steve even made some watermelon and melon balls. Adorable. \u201cI need to replenish my supplies. For my night work.\u201d</p><p>Steve watched Tony eat, almost greedily devouring the chopped fruits. Suddenly the images from the movies flooded his mind, the ones of bored husbands waiting in the changing room, as their wives tried on numerous dresses, presenting themselves to their partners, whose enthusiasms kept dropping with every new outfit, opposite to the women\u2019s who took energy from trying on more clothes. He could picture himself doing that with Tony while being more enthusiastic, of course, and it was a tempting image, one that made his heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Steve nodded, feeling that they both would enjoy that. He sampled the fruit salad and scrunched his nose. \u201cNeeds some honey,\u201d he stated, finding it not enough sweet.</p><p>\u201cI think it is great,\u201d Tony smiled, really enjoying the meal.</p><p>\u201cIt will be better if we drizzle some honey on it, trust me,\u201d Steve said, standing up, \u201cyou have honey?\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes playfully. Seemed that Steve was the master of breakfasts and everything had to be perfect. For Tony, it was tasty as it was, but he could humor him. \u201cCabinet on the left,\u201d he said, putting a piece of banana in his mouth and almost spitting it out in panic. \u201cNO! The other left!\u201d Tony called, but it already happened. Steve opened the cabinet and jumped to the back when the contents spilled, falling in a mess to the countertop and to the floor.</p><p>Steve stared in shock. Tony felt like crawling under the table.</p><p>The concept of snacks wasn\u2019t strange to Steve. Heck, back in his apartment in his own pantry, he always kept a stack of animal crackers for the days he felt nostalgic, and always had on hand a bag of salted potato chips to have something to snack on during watching TV. Having snacks was perfectly normal. But this\u2026 This was numerous bags of pretzel sticks, potato chips in five different flavors, pop tarts, sugary cereals\u2026 Clearly hidden away. And so the abundance of fresh products finally became clear.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you usually eat?!\u201d Steve asked, taking in his hands a box of frosted cornflakes.</p><p>Tony groaned, almost sliding off the chair. \u201cIn my defense, you were not supposed to see this,\u201d he said, sounding and looking embarrassed.</p><p>This situation could lead to many different outcomes, but the one Tony didn\u2019t expect was that, that Steve would start to laugh. And he was laughing, loud and clear, as hearing the best joke ever.</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d Steve kept laughing, tossing the box in the air, before catching it. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked, not feeling as much embarrassed as angry. Steve had too much fun in his discomfort.</p><p>\u201cThis whole time, I thought that you were some out of this world, divine creature who is way out of my league, but you have flaws! This is great news!\u201d Steve continued to laugh, putting the cornflakes aside and smiling at Tony. Every time he saw Red Velvet on stage, he was completely mesmerized - her make up was flawless, she never stumbled and her voice was always clear while singing, not a single false note. She was perfect. And here he was learning that the guy under Red Velvet\u2019s makeup was a regular human being who liked to binge on junk food and felt insecure from time to time. In Steve\u2019s eyes, both Tony and Red Velvet were perfect the way they were. Tony, with his stunning appearance and wit and intelligence, had some imperfections deeply rooted in him, but they made him tangible and close. Red Velvet was a dream, but Tony was the real thing.</p><p>Somehow, Tony didn\u2019t share the enthusiasm and just looked confused.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 You are not disappointed in me?\u201d he asked, genuinely surprised. It would be so heartbreaking that Tony could be so insecure if the circumstances weren\u2019t so hilarious.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d Steve quickly assured, taking Tony\u2019s hand in his. \u201cI am just glad that I finally have a proof that you are a human being,\u201d he continued to laugh.</p><p>Tony grimaced, needing to come clean about one more thing. \u201cAnd what if I told you, that I ordered a cleaning company just to make my apartment presentable for you?\u201d</p><p>Steve stopped laughing. \u201cNow that\u2019s just alarming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, I wanted to make a good first impression,\u201d Tony ducked his head down, feeling embarrassed again.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you make a great first impression,\u201d Steve smiled in all honesty, remembering how he had been twice stunned by Tony. First, with him as Red Velvet in the club, and then in the diner, when he showed up as himself. The first impressions were what made Steve want to meet him, but it was the things that he was learning now, that made him want to stay. \u201cTony?\u201d he asked when Tony still refused to look up. \u201cCome on, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Tony did so. There was still a blush on his face and Steve was sure, it wasn\u2019t makeup this time. A whole lot of insecurities in the brown eyes. This was so much different from when Tony was Red Velvet. Poised and strong and confident. And Steve loved them both. He wanted to be there for Tony in his strongest moments and his most vulnerable. All the time.</p><p>Words were not needed, but actions. When they kissed, it tasted tangy and delicious. And Tony was right, the fruit salad didn\u2019t need any honey, it was already sweet as it was.</p><p>***</p><p>The mall was crowded as usual on the weekends and Steve was surprised that they ended in the mall anyway. He expected that Tony would take him to some small shop, outside the city, where they could have all the privacy they wanted. But how it turned out, he misunderstood Tony\u2019s offer completely.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Steve nodded, walking after Tony into the crowded shop. It had a black sign above with the name of the shop in white, bold print and the shelves were in dark, almost black color, big signs above every cabinet indicating what products you could find. Steve guessed that the black interior was supposed to emphasize more the multicolored stock. In one hundred years, Steve wouldn\u2019t guess that Tony would take him to a handmade cosmetic shop. That\u2019s what he meant by restocking his supplies for the show. Makeup.</p><p>\u201cAnd it is all organic too!\u201d Tony chirped enthusiastically, rubbing some gray goop into his wrist and putting near Steve\u2019s nose to smell. It was a bit sweet, but also an earthy smell.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Steve asked, eyeing suspiciously a table with a tub filled with ice with different colored goops in huge containers placed on top.</p><p>\u201cFacial mask. This one is blueberry and chamomile oil. It calms the skin and makes it more radiant. I am gonna need some of it, but we will take it as the last thing, it needs to stay cold.\u201d</p><p>Steve felt a note of panic. Last thing\u2026?</p><p>\u201cSteve! Keep up, please! We have a lot of things to buy!\u201d</p><p>Steve gritted his teeth. He threw on a brave face and trotted after Tony, holding in his hand the shopping basket.</p><p>Nourishing serum for the night. Moisturizer for the day with jojoba oil. A shampoo bar, thing Steve didn\u2019t even know that existed, that smelled like berries. It was just the beginning and the basket was filling up, as Tony was going from stand to stand, choosing his favorites, sometimes turning to Steve and asking him to smell things. Soon every scent started to mingle into a one, aromatic ball of perfume and he felt a beginning of a headache.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my favorite stand!\u201d Tony spread his arms, standing in front of the wall with baskets filled up to the brim with colorful orbs. \u201cBath bombs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked, not being one to complain, but his arm started to hurt. Maybe he should have taken two baskets.</p><p>\u201cBath bombs. You drop this into a bathtub and it fizzes and the water turns colorful and scented and amazing. You need to try one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a bathtub,\u201d Steve said, finding himself more of a shower kind of person. Soaking in water for hours was not for him.</p><p>\u201cLuckily, I have a one,\u201d Tony said lightly, rummaging in one of the baskets, \u201cand it can fit in two people. You always want to take the ones that are on the bottom, they are the freshest,\u201d Tony said before the first sentence had a chance to sink in Steve\u2019s mind. Taking a bath with Tony sounded like a nice reward after this ordeal. \u201cYou will love this one.\u201d</p><p>Another thing to smell. Steve faked a smile and moved closer, taking a sniff of the ball in milky blue color with the shop\u2019s name stamped on it. It wasn\u2019t that bad. It smelled sweet and subtle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Steve asked, genuinely curious for a change.</p><p>\u201cVanilla and orange blossom. I had a feeling you will like it,\u201d Tony smiled, adding the bath bomb to the pile in the basket.</p><p>\u201c<i>America\u2019s Sweetheart</i>. Really, Tony?\u201d Steve asked dryly, reading the name of the bath bomb.</p><p>Tony cooed and blew a kissy face in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cThis is my favorite one,\u201d he said, turning back to the baskets and taking out another bomb and putting it close to Steve. It was red with white swirls and looked like it had some glitter in it, with a stamped crown on it. Steve smelled it and the fragrance was a bit stronger than the previous bomb but still pleasant. It reminded him of sweet, red apples. He read the name tag and couldn\u2019t help but to laugh.</p><p>\u201c<i>Evil Queen</i>?\u201d he asked Tony. Someone had to have a blast coming up with all those names.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Villains have much more interesting lives than heroes. And I am definitely a queen,\u201d Tony joked, flopping some curls near his ear away in a playful manner.</p><p>Steve could just agree with a smile and then followed his queen on the adventure in the cosmetic shop, as the loyal knight he was.</p><p>***</p><p>The shop wasn\u2019t big, yet Steve felt like it was enormous. He lost count of time and felt that his back and feet started to ache, and the strong smells were starting to irritate him. He considered asking Tony if he could wait outside, but he didn\u2019t want to spoil the moment. It was just really getting hard for him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Steve, quick question!\u201d</p><p>Steve turned his tired eyes to Tony, really hoping that the question was \u2019&lt;do you want to wait outside for me?\u2019 By the way Tony was smiling, Steve could already say that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat color is better for me - this one, or this one?\u201d Tony asked, holding in his hands two lipsticks. He was trying to hide it, but his lips were twitching into a mocking smile, almost as if he planned to torment Steve with the task.</p><p>The joke was on him, though.</p><p>Steve put down the basket and took the two lipsticks, turning more to the light. For the inexperienced eye, both lipsticks seemed red. Steve saw the subtle differences. One was a bold, cherry color, the other a deep, rosy red. One was matt finish, the other sparkly finish.</p><p>\u201cI think both will look great on you,\u201d Steve said, and Tony almost whooped in excitement, pleased that Steve walked into such an obvious trap, \u201cbut you usually wear sparkling materials, so it is better to go with a matte finish, to not overpower the dress. And the rose color will go better with your skin tone, than the cherry one.\u201d</p><p>Tony listened, staring at Steve. It all made sense and it was quite frightening.</p><p>Steve smiled, feeling that he had an upper hand in this matter and handed two lipsticks back to Tony. \u201cI work in an art supply store, Tony. I can tell shades of red apart,\u201d he explained, sounding smug and Tony smiled cheekily.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you full of surprises,\u201d he purred out playfully and put the samples away. He added the rose lipstick into the basket and that made Steve feel a bit proud. Steve hoped that it would be the end for today, but Tony just trotted away to find more products.</p><p>\u201cStevie?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Steve knew this voice. He turned around.</p><p>\u201cMa?!\u201d he gasped, suddenly finding himself in a new situation, one that had written DANGER all over.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey!\u201d Sarah Rogers, Steve\u2019s mom, smiled at her son. She had blond hair and blue eyes, something Steve had inherited from her and had a petite frame. Steve had to lean down when she walked over to kiss her son\u2019s cheek as hello.</p><p>\u201cMa, what are you doing here?\u201d Steve asked, suddenly very aware that he was in a cosmetic shop and that he didn\u2019t belong here, while his mom did.</p><p>\u201cAnd what everyone is doing here? Just a little shopping,\u201d she said, pointing Steve\u2019s attention to the few products in her basket. Her eyes widened when she saw Steve\u2019s brimming one. \u201cOr not so little,\u201d she said, looking confused when she noticed a lipstick displayed proudly on top and other makeup products Tony had recently picked.</p><p>Steve felt his face blushing and looked at his shoes in panic. He had no clue how to explain this all.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this won\u2019t be so easy! Which blush, this one or this one?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>Steve completely froze. Please, not now.</p><p>Tony was quick to asses the situation. He saw the family resemblance and put on a charming smile.</p><p>\u201cHi! I am Tony,\u201d he said in a pleasant voice, waving his hand, \u201cyou must be Steve\u2019s mom. Your son looks very similar to you, Mrs. Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, call me Sarah,\u201d Steve\u2019s mom replied, quickly warming up to Tony. That unfroze Steve a bit.</p><p>\u201cMa, Tony is\u2014\u201d and Steve\u2019s voice got stuck again. Who? Who is Tony? A drag queen? My boyfriend? God, they never even discussed who they were for each other. Steve\u2019s mind whirred in panic.</p><p>\u201cA makeup artist,\u201d Tony came up with a smooth lie, which wasn\u2019t really a lie. \u201cSteve helps me to restock,\u201d Tony explained, and Steve only nodded, not finding his voice.</p><p>\u201cA makeup artist? I didn\u2019t wear any makeup in a long time,\u201d Sarah admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really have to, with your porcelain skin and beautiful cheekbones!\u201d Tony praised enthusiastically and Sarah laughed. Steve looked at Tony in panic. What the heck was happening. \u201cBut if you would like to try a little bit of makeup, I will be happy to help. I have some time, and I could assist you. Think of me as your personal makeup artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to stop you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would love to accompany you! Right, Steve?\u201d still no answer. \u201cI know he would,\u201d Tony decided in Steve\u2019s name and took Sarah\u2019s basket, handing it to Steve. \u201cMake yourself useful, huh?\u201d he whispered to Steve, and the sore tone he used grounded Steve back. Feeling that he screwed up, he quietly padded after his mom and Tony, holding two baskets, Tony already hooking arms with his mom like if they were best friends, as they were discussing makeup and skin care, and Tony was charming and polite, and Steve acted like an idiot.</p><p>It was a day when Steve spent in a cosmetic shop more time than he would like to admit to, but he didn\u2019t notice the time fly, as the whole time he was trying to think what he would tell his mom in the end. What was his relationship with Tony? Calling him his friend seemed too little, and boyfriend was a bold word. Lover was sweet, but could also indicate other things and cause confusion. He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t have any problems, and even if he had one, he didn\u2019t let it show. He made Sarah laugh and joked with her, and was eager to explain every product and find the most suitable ones for her. He even let her use his discount, which was a sweet gesture.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to join us for lunch?\u201d Tony asked when the three of them walked out of the shop. He enjoyed Sarah\u2019s company, and Steve had a nasty feeling that Tony liked her more than him at this particular moment.</p><p>\u201cYou are so sweet, Tony,\u201d Sarah laughed, and Steve could just silently agree, feeling like a fool. \u201cI will leave you boys alone, now. I really want to get home and try that facial mask you recommended to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember to gently coat the skin, don\u2019t work it in,\u201d Tony said, showing on his face to which areas apply the mask. \u201cFifteen minutes is plenty of time to let it sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know a lot about skincare,\u201d Sarah praised, impressed by Tony\u2019s knowledge.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tony fluttered his long eyelashes playfully, taking the compliment with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely seeing you both,\u201d Sarah turned to Steve and Steve leaned down on automat, letting his mom kiss his cheek. Then she turned to Tony and granted him with the same motherly affection.</p><p>\u201cBye, Sarah!\u201d Tony said, waving to Steve\u2019s mom with a smile, as she began to walk away.</p><p>\u201cBye, ma,\u201d Steve said quietly, feeling like hiding into the floor. When his mom mingled with the crowd, Tony slid his arm under Steve\u2019s and urged him to walk.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we have like forty-five minutes to get back before I have to put the facial masks in the fridge. Now when I think about it, we actually don\u2019t have the time to eat, maybe takeaway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, how about some fried rice? Or maybe sushi! Do you like sushi? I could eat some crab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Steve stopped, making someone behind him almost collided into his back. There was some angry cursing, but Steve didn\u2019t pay any attention to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony also stopped, widening his eyes. \u201cNot in the mood for sushi?\u201d</p><p>Steve rubbed his face. It was almost as if Tony had planned to let his guilt consume him and ignore the topic.</p><p>\u201cListen, about what happened\u2026 I am sorry, I went so silent, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Steve asked, looking confused at Tony.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony shrugged, not considering it a big deal. \u201cI understand. Really.\u201d</p><p>It was supposed to be comforting, but something in the tone of Tony\u2019s voice didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>\u201cWait, what do you understand?\u201d Steve asked, feeling that they might be not on the same page.</p><p>\u201cI understand you not telling your mom who I am. It is okay. Your mom is a sweet lady, but I think that hearing that her son is hanging out with a drag queen is beyond her limits.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. This was much worse than Steve thought.</p><p>\u201cI am not ashamed of being with you!\u201d Steve yelled, attracting some attention to them. Tony blinked, slightly taken aback.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Tony asked, his voice sounding a bit cold.</p><p>\u201cGod, Tony,\u201d Steve rubbed his face again. \u201cI just panicked, okay? It doesn\u2019t have to do anything with you being who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is complicated. I never told my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we never discussed it, you know? We keep seeing each other, but I don\u2019t know what it makes us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, back in my days, if you kissed and slept with someone on a regular and exclusive basis, it made you date them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve stared.</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, not in the playful, dramatic way he used to sometimes, but as if he really considered Steve dense. \u201cDating? You know, two people meeting with each other? I know that gay people have an opinion of sleeping around, but I always was a fan of monogamy once I am in relationship with someone, so correct me if I am wrong, because maybe it is just one-sided and I would like to know if it is\u2014\u201d Tony\u2019s blabbing was interrupted, when Steve pressed him close and quietened with a kiss. In the middle of the mall. With people passing by. Tony couldn\u2019t help but blush.</p><p>\u201cUhm, well,\u201d Tony said when Steve let him go, looking adorably shy. \u201cBack in my days, people tried to stay more covert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but times change,\u201d Steve shrugged, hooking their arms together and walking with Tony to the food court, his steps lighter than ever. \u201cAnd I hate raw fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFried rice then,\u201d Tony decided, still feeling a bit weak in the knees after the kiss. But it felt good. As if they made it official. It felt even more than good.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really have to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it is just the two of us. I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I won\u2019t do it, you will pester me until I agree, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s be over with it.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, putting his fingers into the container and getting some gray goop out. He rubbed it between his palms and carefully applied to Steve\u2019s whole face.</p><p>\u201cYour skin will thank me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d Steve griped, although it did feel kinda nice. Cooling. And the smell was nice too.</p><p>\u201cThere. Now do me,\u201d Tony handed Steve the container, smiling adorably. Steve repeated what Tony did to him, careful to not coat any unruly hair trying to make their way out of the headband. He was with Tony in his bathroom, somehow agreeing to a home spa evening. \u201cShould I put it on your beard?\u201d Steve asked, unsure what to do.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just try to work it in the skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said to not work it in the skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you have a smooth face. Like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be jealous once I grow a beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like how you look now.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled, sensing the honesty in Tony\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd I like how you look now,\u201d he booped Tony on the nose playfully, meaning the tiny bathrobe and nothing else underneath. Steve\u2019s outfit was even skimpier as it consisted only of a towel around his hips.</p><p>Tony giggled, and it was a cute reaction he always had whenever Steve kissed or tapped on his nose. Almost as if the tip of his nose was ticklish.</p><p>\u201cReady for your first bath bomb bath?\u201d Tony asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Steve kept smiling because Tony looked so happy. It was somehow contagious.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be \u2019<i>America\u2019s sweetheart</i> or <i>The Evil Queen</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about both? Can we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhmmm. We can try. I just hope my bathtub won\u2019t explode.\u201d</p><p>In the end, Steve had to admit that home spa evenings were not so bad. And bath bombs were pretty amazing.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>song lyrics - <i>Your Move</i> from <i>The Futurist</i> by Robert Downey Jr</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/178016992529/the-pitted-olive-part-3\">&lt;\u2013</a> previous part \u2026..\u00a0next part <a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/180929584104/the-pitted-olive-part-5\">\u2014&gt;\u00a0</a></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br></p><p><b>tag list</b></p><p>(if you want to be tagged for updates in this series, send me an ask and I will add your username below)</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miYHPaykxNNCM2iUdGMUTRQ\">@destiel-is-classic</a>, @<a href=\"http://prithvik.tumblr.com/\">prithvik</a> , @<a href=\"http://azurixx.tumblr.com/\">azurixx</a> , \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myQWyK5tgTODVt0P6ETaulQ\">@mangakats</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmDPUGGjfYW-OCBb9zvaRkQ\">@mystey-writes</a><br></p>",

Steve had been in the corridor, waiting for Tony to be done and stood up when the man approached him. Tony skipped a bit, as if trying to find back his balance after hours on high heels and looked tired, but happy. His shows always attracted a lot of people and he loved the attention.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDid you like my new song?\u201d Tony asked as he locked his arms together with Steve\u2019s. \u201cWrote it for you,\u201d he added in a flirting tone, batting his eyelashes, which still were long, even without the fake ones attached.</p><p><i>\u201c\u2018Cause it\u2019s time, it\u2019s time in time with your time and its news is captured. For the queen to use.\u201d</i></p><p>Steve smiled, remembering the song. It was mellow and more carefree than what usually Tony sang. Steve wouldn\u2019t dare to say that it had a cheerful and subtle country note, but it reminded him a bit of that.</p><p>\u201cI liked the \u2019<i>diddit diddit didda\u2019 part,</i>\u201d Steve admitted, as cold night air surrounded them when they walked through the back door of the club and into the street.</p><p>Tony made a face and stuck his tongue out. \u201cShould have known. Why I even try for you.\u201d He didn\u2019t have more occasions to complain as Steve turned to him and fitted a hand on the brunet\u2019s cheek, leaning down for a kiss. A sweet, brush of lips, becoming more heated with time in the dark, empty street. The soft lips tasted like the cherry flavored lips gloss Red Velvet liked to use.</p><p>\u201cMhm. I guess that\u2019s why,\u201d Tony chuckled and fluttered his eyes in delight when the kiss ended. Steve only smiled cheekily, proving his point.</p><p>\u201cAny plans for the rest of the night?\u201d Steve asked, putting both hands on Tony\u2019s hips and swaying with him. \u201cWanna grab a bite?\u201d a shared late night meal after Red Velvet\u2019s show became one of their rituals.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Tony hesitated, rubbing at his shorter goatee. The skin itched a little bit after hours of being covered in latex. \u201cI was thinking that maybe tonight I will take you to my place? Maybe we could spend the weekend together,\u201d he added, suddenly sounding shy.</p><p>Steve stared at Tony in surprise. In their almost a month dating time, neither of them ever been to the other\u2019s place. Steve already felt like barging into Tony\u2019s space and wanted to slow things down a bit and get to know each other better before taking that step. Seemed that Tony had different plans for them. It was something comforting and intimate about it and made him feel all happy inside. Trusting his gut feeling, he decided to go with it.</p><p>\u201cSure. I would love to,\u201d Steve said softly and they began walking to the parking lot, chatting excitedly. It was surprising how easy everything was going for them, and Steve loved how open Tony could be about everything. It was a nice change in his life.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my car,\u201d Tony stopped and took out a set of car keys, pressing on the button and making the orange Audi flash its lights.</p><p>\u201cOrange?\u201d Steve asked in humor, not imagining that Tony would ever choose an orange car. Black. Red. Some dark color. But orange? \u201cYou really like to attract attention,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cActually, it was a bet,\u201d Tony explained, getting in and motioning for Steve to do the same. Once they settled in, he continued. \u201cMy friend, Rhodey, once told me that no one looks good in orange. So, I bought an orange car to prove him wrong,\u201d he ended the story on a lighthearted note, and Steve had to think for a while what was Tony\u2019s day job that he could afford a new car, just to win a bet. \u201cSeat belts,\u201d Tony reminded, waiting for Steve to fasten his seat belts.</p><p>\u201cDoes your friend know that you are\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drag queen? Yeah, he knows. We had this talk when I once wanted to wear an orange dress and he tried to talk me out of it. The whole joke is that, that he looks great in orange, just doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d Tony laughed, making sure that the road behind them was clear before he drove out of the parking and into the street.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a long ride, and it was quite pleasant, with the road being almost empty and the distance seemed shorter to Steve. Tony\u2019s apartment was in one of those new building, and it was in pristine condition, and everything was sparkling clean and neatly organized and had more of a hotel vibe than a home feeling to it. Tony handed Steve some clean towels and a toothbrush, and even lend him a shirt and pants to sleep in. They both were tired after a long week and soon collapsed on Tony\u2019s king-sized bed, sharing a goodnight kiss and nothing more, not having strength.</p><p>Morning was a whole different story.</p><p>***</p><p>Steve always woke up early. It was how his body was functioning and he came to terms with it a long time ago. And Steve really loved mornings. He loved how quiet it was and how he could plan his day in peace before the usual chaos started. Today, he didn\u2019t have any plans. He stayed in bed, laying on his side, with his head propped on one hand and watched Tony sleeping, taking in every second. The sun just started to rise and fill the white apartment with sunlight and Tony looked absolutely gorgeous. He was on his back, arms placed over his head in a carefree manner and some cute curls were falling on his forehead. His skin had some divine glow to it, and his lips seemed moist and plump and invitingly wet and shiny\u2026</p><p>Wait, shiny?</p><p>Something didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Steve whispered, aware that he might be wrong and if that was the case, he didn\u2019t want to disturb the other\u2019s sleep. \u201cAre you wearing makeup?\u201d he asked, recognizing the blush color Tony used as Red Velvet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d came a quick answer, too quick and delivered in a fully awake voice, and Tony cringed, realizing that he gave himself away. Steve smiled broadly and did the only reasonable things - he grabbed the edge of the white covers and strongly rubbed it over brunet\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony immediately protested and lowered his hands to push away the material. \u201cSteve!\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long until Steve was satisfied with his job and threw the smudged covers away, getting off the layers of foundation, blushes, and highlighters. What was left, was Tony\u2019s skin, natural and tanned and soft, showing some laugh lines and shadows under his eyes. The whole carefully planned look was gone and yet\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Steve said in an honest voice, finding Tony even more breathtaking than before.</p><p>Tony groaned and threw arms over his face, covering himself. \u201cI hate you and your young, smooth skin,\u201d he grunted, sounding embarrassed. The age difference between them wasn\u2019t so big to start with, but sometimes Tony felt more bothered by it.</p><p>Steve gently lowered Tony\u2019s arms, feeling happiness growing in him when the other man allowed that and leaned down to kiss the tip of his nose. It was silly and sweet and Tony giggled, his eyes and nose crinkling at the simple affection.</p><p>\u201cYou know since we are both awake already\u2026\u201d Steve hummed, rubbing their noses together. Tony didn\u2019t need to hear it twice and wrapped arms around Steve\u2019s neck, holding him in place and pushing his hips up to match Steve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tony gasped, feeling a distinctive hardness on Steve\u2019s body. \u201cHm. I guess having a younger lover has its perks,\u201d Tony giggled and Steve quieted him down with more kisses.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cIt is a filthy habit and I hope you know it.\u201d</p><p>Tony only smiled contrarily, standing on the shadow part of the balcony in a silk, white night robe that ended just an inch below his round butt. It would be a very tempting picture if he wasn\u2019t smoking, blowing the smoke out in small circles as if to rile up Steve more. It was just funny to him.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could eat outside, but you ruined it,\u201d Steve continued to complain, beating egg whites for omelets. He already cut up some fresh fruits for a fruit salad, made freshly squeezed orange juice and had chopped mushroom and sweet bell peppers on hand, ready to toss in the eggs mixture when needed. It was quite amazing how well stocked in fresh vegetables and fruits Tony\u2019s kitchen was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad,\u201d Tony said, not sounding apologetic at all. He stepped into the kitchen, bringing the stinging scent of cigarettes with him. \u201cBesides, such a great morning required a smoke. I am glad I am not performing today, I don\u2019t think I can walk on heels,\u201d he tried to joke and kiss Steve on the neck, but was stopped by blond\u2019s stern look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, unless you brush your teeth,\u201d Steve said, sounding serious.</p><p>Tony whistled, but obediently walked to the bathroom. \u201cYou know, if I was wearing a dress, you wouldn\u2019t use that tone towards me!\u201d he yelled, reminding Steve of their first meeting outside the club. Steve was too stunned back then and it was no opening line to call someone out on smoking, but after almost a month of dating, he felt he earned the right.</p><p>Steve just smiled, hearing as Tony started to brush his teeth, considering it a win.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHey, wanna go shopping with me later?\u201d Tony asked, finishing his omelet. It was a fluffy heaven and Tony loved Steve for adding some chopped ham into it. Delicious.</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d Steve repeated, putting a portion of the fruit salad into a bowl and handing it to Tony, who smiled gratefully at him. It was endearing how eating made Tony happy. Steve would later try to talk him out of his habit of starving himself before his shows. Tony looked great anyway. \u201cBut you are fully stocked,\u201d Steve said, meaning the full fridge and pantry, not imagining what else he might need.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean grocery shopping,\u201d Tony said, clearing his plate and digging into the fruit salad. Steve even made some watermelon and melon balls. Adorable. \u201cI need to replenish my supplies. For my night work.\u201d</p><p>Steve watched Tony eat, almost greedily devouring the chopped fruits. Suddenly the images from the movies flooded his mind, the ones of bored husbands waiting in the changing room, as their wives tried on numerous dresses, presenting themselves to their partners, whose enthusiasms kept dropping with every new outfit, opposite to the women\u2019s who took energy from trying on more clothes. He could picture himself doing that with Tony while being more enthusiastic, of course, and it was a tempting image, one that made his heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Steve nodded, feeling that they both would enjoy that. He sampled the fruit salad and scrunched his nose. \u201cNeeds some honey,\u201d he stated, finding it not enough sweet.</p><p>\u201cI think it is great,\u201d Tony smiled, really enjoying the meal.</p><p>\u201cIt will be better if we drizzle some honey on it, trust me,\u201d Steve said, standing up, \u201cyou have honey?\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes playfully. Seemed that Steve was the master of breakfasts and everything had to be perfect. For Tony, it was tasty as it was, but he could humor him. \u201cCabinet on the left,\u201d he said, putting a piece of banana in his mouth and almost spitting it out in panic. \u201cNO! The other left!\u201d Tony called, but it already happened. Steve opened the cabinet and jumped to the back when the contents spilled, falling in a mess to the countertop and to the floor.</p><p>Steve stared in shock. Tony felt like crawling under the table.</p><p>The concept of snacks wasn\u2019t strange to Steve. Heck, back in his apartment in his own pantry, he always kept a stack of animal crackers for the days he felt nostalgic, and always had on hand a bag of salted potato chips to have something to snack on during watching TV. Having snacks was perfectly normal. But this\u2026 This was numerous bags of pretzel sticks, potato chips in five different flavors, pop tarts, sugary cereals\u2026 Clearly hidden away. And so the abundance of fresh products finally became clear.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you usually eat?!\u201d Steve asked, taking in his hands a box of frosted cornflakes.</p><p>Tony groaned, almost sliding off the chair. \u201cIn my defense, you were not supposed to see this,\u201d he said, sounding and looking embarrassed.</p><p>This situation could lead to many different outcomes, but the one Tony didn\u2019t expect was that, that Steve would start to laugh. And he was laughing, loud and clear, as hearing the best joke ever.</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d Steve kept laughing, tossing the box in the air, before catching it. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asked, not feeling as much embarrassed as angry. Steve had too much fun in his discomfort.</p><p>\u201cThis whole time, I thought that you were some out of this world, divine creature who is way out of my league, but you have flaws! This is great news!\u201d Steve continued to laugh, putting the cornflakes aside and smiling at Tony. Every time he saw Red Velvet on stage, he was completely mesmerized - her make up was flawless, she never stumbled and her voice was always clear while singing, not a single false note. She was perfect. And here he was learning that the guy under Red Velvet\u2019s makeup was a regular human being who liked to binge on junk food and felt insecure from time to time. In Steve\u2019s eyes, both Tony and Red Velvet were perfect the way they were. Tony, with his stunning appearance and wit and intelligence, had some imperfections deeply rooted in him, but they made him tangible and close. Red Velvet was a dream, but Tony was the real thing.</p><p>Somehow, Tony didn\u2019t share the enthusiasm and just looked confused.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 You are not disappointed in me?\u201d he asked, genuinely surprised. It would be so heartbreaking that Tony could be so insecure if the circumstances weren\u2019t so hilarious.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d Steve quickly assured, taking Tony\u2019s hand in his. \u201cI am just glad that I finally have a proof that you are a human being,\u201d he continued to laugh.</p><p>Tony grimaced, needing to come clean about one more thing. \u201cAnd what if I told you, that I ordered a cleaning company just to make my apartment presentable for you?\u201d</p><p>Steve stopped laughing. \u201cNow that\u2019s just alarming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, I wanted to make a good first impression,\u201d Tony ducked his head down, feeling embarrassed again.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, you make a great first impression,\u201d Steve smiled in all honesty, remembering how he had been twice stunned by Tony. First, with him as Red Velvet in the club, and then in the diner, when he showed up as himself. The first impressions were what made Steve want to meet him, but it was the things that he was learning now, that made him want to stay. \u201cTony?\u201d he asked when Tony still refused to look up. \u201cCome on, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Tony did so. There was still a blush on his face and Steve was sure, it wasn\u2019t makeup this time. A whole lot of insecurities in the brown eyes. This was so much different from when Tony was Red Velvet. Poised and strong and confident. And Steve loved them both. He wanted to be there for Tony in his strongest moments and his most vulnerable. All the time.</p><p>Words were not needed, but actions. When they kissed, it tasted tangy and delicious. And Tony was right, the fruit salad didn\u2019t need any honey, it was already sweet as it was.</p><p>***</p><p>The mall was crowded as usual on the weekends and Steve was surprised that they ended in the mall anyway. He expected that Tony would take him to some small shop, outside the city, where they could have all the privacy they wanted. But how it turned out, he misunderstood Tony\u2019s offer completely.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Steve nodded, walking after Tony into the crowded shop. It had a black sign above with the name of the shop in white, bold print and the shelves were in dark, almost black color, big signs above every cabinet indicating what products you could find. Steve guessed that the black interior was supposed to emphasize more the multicolored stock. In one hundred years, Steve wouldn\u2019t guess that Tony would take him to a handmade cosmetic shop. That\u2019s what he meant by restocking his supplies for the show. Makeup.</p><p>\u201cAnd it is all organic too!\u201d Tony chirped enthusiastically, rubbing some gray goop into his wrist and putting near Steve\u2019s nose to smell. It was a bit sweet, but also an earthy smell.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Steve asked, eyeing suspiciously a table with a tub filled with ice with different colored goops in huge containers placed on top.</p><p>\u201cFacial mask. This one is blueberry and chamomile oil. It calms the skin and makes it more radiant. I am gonna need some of it, but we will take it as the last thing, it needs to stay cold.\u201d</p><p>Steve felt a note of panic. Last thing\u2026?</p><p>\u201cSteve! Keep up, please! We have a lot of things to buy!\u201d</p><p>Steve gritted his teeth. He threw on a brave face and trotted after Tony, holding in his hand the shopping basket.</p><p>Nourishing serum for the night. Moisturizer for the day with jojoba oil. A shampoo bar, thing Steve didn\u2019t even know that existed, that smelled like berries. It was just the beginning and the basket was filling up, as Tony was going from stand to stand, choosing his favorites, sometimes turning to Steve and asking him to smell things. Soon every scent started to mingle into a one, aromatic ball of perfume and he felt a beginning of a headache.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my favorite stand!\u201d Tony spread his arms, standing in front of the wall with baskets filled up to the brim with colorful orbs. \u201cBath bombs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked, not being one to complain, but his arm started to hurt. Maybe he should have taken two baskets.</p><p>\u201cBath bombs. You drop this into a bathtub and it fizzes and the water turns colorful and scented and amazing. You need to try one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a bathtub,\u201d Steve said, finding himself more of a shower kind of person. Soaking in water for hours was not for him.</p><p>\u201cLuckily, I have a one,\u201d Tony said lightly, rummaging in one of the baskets, \u201cand it can fit in two people. You always want to take the ones that are on the bottom, they are the freshest,\u201d Tony said before the first sentence had a chance to sink in Steve\u2019s mind. Taking a bath with Tony sounded like a nice reward after this ordeal. \u201cYou will love this one.\u201d</p><p>Another thing to smell. Steve faked a smile and moved closer, taking a sniff of the ball in milky blue color with the shop\u2019s name stamped on it. It wasn\u2019t that bad. It smelled sweet and subtle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Steve asked, genuinely curious for a change.</p><p>\u201cVanilla and orange blossom. I had a feeling you will like it,\u201d Tony smiled, adding the bath bomb to the pile in the basket.</p><p>\u201c<i>America\u2019s Sweetheart</i>. Really, Tony?\u201d Steve asked dryly, reading the name of the bath bomb.</p><p>Tony cooed and blew a kissy face in Steve\u2019s direction. \u201cThis is my favorite one,\u201d he said, turning back to the baskets and taking out another bomb and putting it close to Steve. It was red with white swirls and looked like it had some glitter in it, with a stamped crown on it. Steve smelled it and the fragrance was a bit stronger than the previous bomb but still pleasant. It reminded him of sweet, red apples. He read the name tag and couldn\u2019t help but to laugh.</p><p>\u201c<i>Evil Queen</i>?\u201d he asked Tony. Someone had to have a blast coming up with all those names.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Villains have much more interesting lives than heroes. And I am definitely a queen,\u201d Tony joked, flopping some curls near his ear away in a playful manner.</p><p>Steve could just agree with a smile and then followed his queen on the adventure in the cosmetic shop, as the loyal knight he was.</p><p>***</p><p>The shop wasn\u2019t big, yet Steve felt like it was enormous. He lost count of time and felt that his back and feet started to ache, and the strong smells were starting to irritate him. He considered asking Tony if he could wait outside, but he didn\u2019t want to spoil the moment. It was just really getting hard for him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Steve, quick question!\u201d</p><p>Steve turned his tired eyes to Tony, really hoping that the question was \u2019&lt;do you want to wait outside for me?\u2019 By the way Tony was smiling, Steve could already say that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat color is better for me - this one, or this one?\u201d Tony asked, holding in his hands two lipsticks. He was trying to hide it, but his lips were twitching into a mocking smile, almost as if he planned to torment Steve with the task.</p><p>The joke was on him, though.</p><p>Steve put down the basket and took the two lipsticks, turning more to the light. For the inexperienced eye, both lipsticks seemed red. Steve saw the subtle differences. One was a bold, cherry color, the other a deep, rosy red. One was matt finish, the other sparkly finish.</p><p>\u201cI think both will look great on you,\u201d Steve said, and Tony almost whooped in excitement, pleased that Steve walked into such an obvious trap, \u201cbut you usually wear sparkling materials, so it is better to go with a matte finish, to not overpower the dress. And the rose color will go better with your skin tone, than the cherry one.\u201d</p><p>Tony listened, staring at Steve. It all made sense and it was quite frightening.</p><p>Steve smiled, feeling that he had an upper hand in this matter and handed two lipsticks back to Tony. \u201cI work in an art supply store, Tony. I can tell shades of red apart,\u201d he explained, sounding smug and Tony smiled cheekily.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you full of surprises,\u201d he purred out playfully and put the samples away. He added the rose lipstick into the basket and that made Steve feel a bit proud. Steve hoped that it would be the end for today, but Tony just trotted away to find more products.</p><p>\u201cStevie?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Steve knew this voice. He turned around.</p><p>\u201cMa?!\u201d he gasped, suddenly finding himself in a new situation, one that had written DANGER all over.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey!\u201d Sarah Rogers, Steve\u2019s mom, smiled at her son. She had blond hair and blue eyes, something Steve had inherited from her and had a petite frame. Steve had to lean down when she walked over to kiss her son\u2019s cheek as hello.</p><p>\u201cMa, what are you doing here?\u201d Steve asked, suddenly very aware that he was in a cosmetic shop and that he didn\u2019t belong here, while his mom did.</p><p>\u201cAnd what everyone is doing here? Just a little shopping,\u201d she said, pointing Steve\u2019s attention to the few products in her basket. Her eyes widened when she saw Steve\u2019s brimming one. \u201cOr not so little,\u201d she said, looking confused when she noticed a lipstick displayed proudly on top and other makeup products Tony had recently picked.</p><p>Steve felt his face blushing and looked at his shoes in panic. He had no clue how to explain this all.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this won\u2019t be so easy! Which blush, this one or this one?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>Steve completely froze. Please, not now.</p><p>Tony was quick to asses the situation. He saw the family resemblance and put on a charming smile.</p><p>\u201cHi! I am Tony,\u201d he said in a pleasant voice, waving his hand, \u201cyou must be Steve\u2019s mom. Your son looks very similar to you, Mrs. Rogers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, call me Sarah,\u201d Steve\u2019s mom replied, quickly warming up to Tony. That unfroze Steve a bit.</p><p>\u201cMa, Tony is\u2014\u201d and Steve\u2019s voice got stuck again. Who? Who is Tony? A drag queen? My boyfriend? God, they never even discussed who they were for each other. Steve\u2019s mind whirred in panic.</p><p>\u201cA makeup artist,\u201d Tony came up with a smooth lie, which wasn\u2019t really a lie. \u201cSteve helps me to restock,\u201d Tony explained, and Steve only nodded, not finding his voice.</p><p>\u201cA makeup artist? I didn\u2019t wear any makeup in a long time,\u201d Sarah admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really have to, with your porcelain skin and beautiful cheekbones!\u201d Tony praised enthusiastically and Sarah laughed. Steve looked at Tony in panic. What the heck was happening. \u201cBut if you would like to try a little bit of makeup, I will be happy to help. I have some time, and I could assist you. Think of me as your personal makeup artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to stop you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would love to accompany you! Right, Steve?\u201d still no answer. \u201cI know he would,\u201d Tony decided in Steve\u2019s name and took Sarah\u2019s basket, handing it to Steve. \u201cMake yourself useful, huh?\u201d he whispered to Steve, and the sore tone he used grounded Steve back. Feeling that he screwed up, he quietly padded after his mom and Tony, holding two baskets, Tony already hooking arms with his mom like if they were best friends, as they were discussing makeup and skin care, and Tony was charming and polite, and Steve acted like an idiot.</p><p>It was a day when Steve spent in a cosmetic shop more time than he would like to admit to, but he didn\u2019t notice the time fly, as the whole time he was trying to think what he would tell his mom in the end. What was his relationship with Tony? Calling him his friend seemed too little, and boyfriend was a bold word. Lover was sweet, but could also indicate other things and cause confusion. He didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t have any problems, and even if he had one, he didn\u2019t let it show. He made Sarah laugh and joked with her, and was eager to explain every product and find the most suitable ones for her. He even let her use his discount, which was a sweet gesture.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to join us for lunch?\u201d Tony asked when the three of them walked out of the shop. He enjoyed Sarah\u2019s company, and Steve had a nasty feeling that Tony liked her more than him at this particular moment.</p><p>\u201cYou are so sweet, Tony,\u201d Sarah laughed, and Steve could just silently agree, feeling like a fool. \u201cI will leave you boys alone, now. I really want to get home and try that facial mask you recommended to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember to gently coat the skin, don\u2019t work it in,\u201d Tony said, showing on his face to which areas apply the mask. \u201cFifteen minutes is plenty of time to let it sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know a lot about skincare,\u201d Sarah praised, impressed by Tony\u2019s knowledge.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tony fluttered his long eyelashes playfully, taking the compliment with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely seeing you both,\u201d Sarah turned to Steve and Steve leaned down on automat, letting his mom kiss his cheek. Then she turned to Tony and granted him with the same motherly affection.</p><p>\u201cBye, Sarah!\u201d Tony said, waving to Steve\u2019s mom with a smile, as she began to walk away.</p><p>\u201cBye, ma,\u201d Steve said quietly, feeling like hiding into the floor. When his mom mingled with the crowd, Tony slid his arm under Steve\u2019s and urged him to walk.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we have like forty-five minutes to get back before I have to put the facial masks in the fridge. Now when I think about it, we actually don\u2019t have the time to eat, maybe takeaway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, how about some fried rice? Or maybe sushi! Do you like sushi? I could eat some crab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Steve stopped, making someone behind him almost collided into his back. There was some angry cursing, but Steve didn\u2019t pay any attention to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony also stopped, widening his eyes. \u201cNot in the mood for sushi?\u201d</p><p>Steve rubbed his face. It was almost as if Tony had planned to let his guilt consume him and ignore the topic.</p><p>\u201cListen, about what happened\u2026 I am sorry, I went so silent, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Steve asked, looking confused at Tony.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony shrugged, not considering it a big deal. \u201cI understand. Really.\u201d</p><p>It was supposed to be comforting, but something in the tone of Tony\u2019s voice didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>\u201cWait, what do you understand?\u201d Steve asked, feeling that they might be not on the same page.</p><p>\u201cI understand you not telling your mom who I am. It is okay. Your mom is a sweet lady, but I think that hearing that her son is hanging out with a drag queen is beyond her limits.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. This was much worse than Steve thought.</p><p>\u201cI am not ashamed of being with you!\u201d Steve yelled, attracting some attention to them. Tony blinked, slightly taken aback.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Tony asked, his voice sounding a bit cold.</p><p>\u201cGod, Tony,\u201d Steve rubbed his face again. \u201cI just panicked, okay? It doesn\u2019t have to do anything with you being who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is complicated. I never told my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we never discussed it, you know? We keep seeing each other, but I don\u2019t know what it makes us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, back in my days, if you kissed and slept with someone on a regular and exclusive basis, it made you date them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve stared.</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, not in the playful, dramatic way he used to sometimes, but as if he really considered Steve dense. \u201cDating? You know, two people meeting with each other? I know that gay people have an opinion of sleeping around, but I always was a fan of monogamy once I am in relationship with someone, so correct me if I am wrong, because maybe it is just one-sided and I would like to know if it is\u2014\u201d Tony\u2019s blabbing was interrupted, when Steve pressed him close and quietened with a kiss. In the middle of the mall. With people passing by. Tony couldn\u2019t help but blush.</p><p>\u201cUhm, well,\u201d Tony said when Steve let him go, looking adorably shy. \u201cBack in my days, people tried to stay more covert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but times change,\u201d Steve shrugged, hooking their arms together and walking with Tony to the food court, his steps lighter than ever. \u201cAnd I hate raw fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFried rice then,\u201d Tony decided, still feeling a bit weak in the knees after the kiss. But it felt good. As if they made it official. It felt even more than good.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really have to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it is just the two of us. I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I won\u2019t do it, you will pester me until I agree, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s be over with it.\u201d</p><p>Tony smiled, putting his fingers into the container and getting some gray goop out. He rubbed it between his palms and carefully applied to Steve\u2019s whole face.</p><p>\u201cYour skin will thank me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d Steve griped, although it did feel kinda nice. Cooling. And the smell was nice too.</p><p>\u201cThere. Now do me,\u201d Tony handed Steve the container, smiling adorably. Steve repeated what Tony did to him, careful to not coat any unruly hair trying to make their way out of the headband. He was with Tony in his bathroom, somehow agreeing to a home spa evening. \u201cShould I put it on your beard?\u201d Steve asked, unsure what to do.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just try to work it in the skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said to not work it in the skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you have a smooth face. Like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be jealous once I grow a beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like how you look now.\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled, sensing the honesty in Tony\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd I like how you look now,\u201d he booped Tony on the nose playfully, meaning the tiny bathrobe and nothing else underneath. Steve\u2019s outfit was even skimpier as it consisted only of a towel around his hips.</p><p>Tony giggled, and it was a cute reaction he always had whenever Steve kissed or tapped on his nose. Almost as if the tip of his nose was ticklish.</p><p>\u201cReady for your first bath bomb bath?\u201d Tony asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Steve kept smiling because Tony looked so happy.

Steve had been in the corridor, waiting for Tony to be done and stood up when the man approached him. Tony skipped a bit, as if trying to find back his balance after hours on high heels and looked tired, but happy. His shows always attracted a lot of people and he loved the attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you like my new song?&rdquo; Tony asked as he locked his arms together with Steve&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Wrote it for you,&rdquo; he added in a flirting tone, batting his eyelashes, which still were long, even without the fake ones attached.</p><p><i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s time in time with your time and its news is captured. For the queen to use.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Steve smiled, remembering the song. It was mellow and more carefree than what usually Tony sang. Steve wouldn&rsquo;t dare to say that it had a cheerful and subtle country note, but it reminded him a bit of that.</p><p>&ldquo;I liked the &rsquo;<i>diddit diddit didda&rsquo; part,</i>&rdquo; Steve admitted, as cold night air surrounded them when they walked through the back door of the club and into the street.</p><p>Tony made a face and stuck his tongue out. &ldquo;Should have known. Why I even try for you.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t have more occasions to complain as Steve turned to him and fitted a hand on the brunet&rsquo;s cheek, leaning down for a kiss. A sweet, brush of lips, becoming more heated with time in the dark, empty street. The soft lips tasted like the cherry flavored lips gloss Red Velvet liked to use.</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm. I guess that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; Tony chuckled and fluttered his eyes in delight when the kiss ended. Steve only smiled cheekily, proving his point.</p><p>&ldquo;Any plans for the rest of the night?&rdquo; Steve asked, putting both hands on Tony&rsquo;s hips and swaying with him. &ldquo;Wanna grab a bite?&rdquo; a shared late night meal after Red Velvet&rsquo;s show became one of their rituals.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Tony hesitated, rubbing at his shorter goatee. The skin itched a little bit after hours of being covered in latex. &ldquo;I was thinking that maybe tonight I will take you to my place? Maybe we could spend the weekend together,&rdquo; he added, suddenly sounding shy.</p><p>Steve stared at Tony in surprise. In their almost a month dating time, neither of them ever been to the other&rsquo;s place. Steve already felt like barging into Tony&rsquo;s space and wanted to slow things down a bit and get to know each other better before taking that step. Seemed that Tony had different plans for them. It was something comforting and intimate about it and made him feel all happy inside. Trusting his gut feeling, he decided to go with it.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. I would love to,&rdquo; Steve said softly and they began walking to the parking lot, chatting excitedly. It was surprising how easy everything was going for them, and Steve loved how open Tony could be about everything. It was a nice change in his life.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my car,&rdquo; Tony stopped and took out a set of car keys, pressing on the button and making the orange Audi flash its lights.</p><p>&ldquo;Orange?&rdquo; Steve asked in humor, not imagining that Tony would ever choose an orange car. Black. Red. Some dark color. But orange? &ldquo;You really like to attract attention,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, it was a bet,&rdquo; Tony explained, getting in and motioning for Steve to do the same. Once they settled in, he continued. &ldquo;My friend, Rhodey, once told me that no one looks good in orange. So, I bought an orange car to prove him wrong,&rdquo; he ended the story on a lighthearted note, and Steve had to think for a while what was Tony&rsquo;s day job that he could afford a new car, just to win a bet. &ldquo;Seat belts,&rdquo; Tony reminded, waiting for Steve to fasten his seat belts.</p><p>&ldquo;Does your friend know that you are&mdash;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A drag queen? Yeah, he knows. We had this talk when I once wanted to wear an orange dress and he tried to talk me out of it. The whole joke is that, that he looks great in orange, just doesn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; Tony laughed, making sure that the road behind them was clear before he drove out of the parking and into the street.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a long ride, and it was quite pleasant, with the road being almost empty and the distance seemed shorter to Steve. Tony&rsquo;s apartment was in one of those new building, and it was in pristine condition, and everything was sparkling clean and neatly organized and had more of a hotel vibe than a home feeling to it. Tony handed Steve some clean towels and a toothbrush, and even lend him a shirt and pants to sleep in. They both were tired after a long week and soon collapsed on Tony&rsquo;s king-sized bed, sharing a goodnight kiss and nothing more, not having strength.</p><p>Morning was a whole different story.</p><p>***</p><p>Steve always woke up early. It was how his body was functioning and he came to terms with it a long time ago. And Steve really loved mornings. He loved how quiet it was and how he could plan his day in peace before the usual chaos started. Today, he didn&rsquo;t have any plans. He stayed in bed, laying on his side, with his head propped on one hand and watched Tony sleeping, taking in every second. The sun just started to rise and fill the white apartment with sunlight and Tony looked absolutely gorgeous. He was on his back, arms placed over his head in a carefree manner and some cute curls were falling on his forehead. His skin had some divine glow to it, and his lips seemed moist and plump and invitingly wet and shiny&hellip;</p><p>Wait, shiny?</p><p>Something didn&rsquo;t add up.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Steve whispered, aware that he might be wrong and if that was the case, he didn&rsquo;t want to disturb the other&rsquo;s sleep. &ldquo;Are you wearing makeup?&rdquo; he asked, recognizing the blush color Tony used as Red Velvet.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came a quick answer, too quick and delivered in a fully awake voice, and Tony cringed, realizing that he gave himself away. Steve smiled broadly and did the only reasonable things - he grabbed the edge of the white covers and strongly rubbed it over brunet&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Tony immediately protested and lowered his hands to push away the material. &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long until Steve was satisfied with his job and threw the smudged covers away, getting off the layers of foundation, blushes, and highlighters. What was left, was Tony&rsquo;s skin, natural and tanned and soft, showing some laugh lines and shadows under his eyes. The whole carefully planned look was gone and yet&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful,&rdquo; Steve said in an honest voice, finding Tony even more breathtaking than before.</p><p>Tony groaned and threw arms over his face, covering himself. &ldquo;I hate you and your young, smooth skin,&rdquo; he grunted, sounding embarrassed. The age difference between them wasn&rsquo;t so big to start with, but sometimes Tony felt more bothered by it.</p><p>Steve gently lowered Tony&rsquo;s arms, feeling happiness growing in him when the other man allowed that and leaned down to kiss the tip of his nose. It was silly and sweet and Tony giggled, his eyes and nose crinkling at the simple affection.</p><p>&ldquo;You know since we are both awake already&hellip;&rdquo; Steve hummed, rubbing their noses together. Tony didn&rsquo;t need to hear it twice and wrapped arms around Steve&rsquo;s neck, holding him in place and pushing his hips up to match Steve&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Tony gasped, feeling a distinctive hardness on Steve&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;Hm. I guess having a younger lover has its perks,&rdquo; Tony giggled and Steve quieted him down with more kisses.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;It is a filthy habit and I hope you know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony only smiled contrarily, standing on the shadow part of the balcony in a silk, white night robe that ended just an inch below his round butt. It would be a very tempting picture if he wasn&rsquo;t smoking, blowing the smoke out in small circles as if to rile up Steve more. It was just funny to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking we could eat outside, but you ruined it,&rdquo; Steve continued to complain, beating egg whites for omelets. He already cut up some fresh fruits for a fruit salad, made freshly squeezed orange juice and had chopped mushroom and sweet bell peppers on hand, ready to toss in the eggs mixture when needed. It was quite amazing how well stocked in fresh vegetables and fruits Tony&rsquo;s kitchen was.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad,&rdquo; Tony said, not sounding apologetic at all. He stepped into the kitchen, bringing the stinging scent of cigarettes with him. &ldquo;Besides, such a great morning required a smoke. I am glad I am not performing today, I don&rsquo;t think I can walk on heels,&rdquo; he tried to joke and kiss Steve on the neck, but was stopped by blond&rsquo;s stern look.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it, unless you brush your teeth,&rdquo; Steve said, sounding serious.</p><p>Tony whistled, but obediently walked to the bathroom. &ldquo;You know, if I was wearing a dress, you wouldn&rsquo;t use that tone towards me!&rdquo; he yelled, reminding Steve of their first meeting outside the club. Steve was too stunned back then and it was no opening line to call someone out on smoking, but after almost a month of dating, he felt he earned the right.</p><p>Steve just smiled, hearing as Tony started to brush his teeth, considering it a win.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, wanna go shopping with me later?&rdquo; Tony asked, finishing his omelet. It was a fluffy heaven and Tony loved Steve for adding some chopped ham into it. Delicious.</p><p>&ldquo;Shopping?&rdquo; Steve repeated, putting a portion of the fruit salad into a bowl and handing it to Tony, who smiled gratefully at him. It was endearing how eating made Tony happy. Steve would later try to talk him out of his habit of starving himself before his shows. Tony looked great anyway. &ldquo;But you are fully stocked,&rdquo; Steve said, meaning the full fridge and pantry, not imagining what else he might need.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean grocery shopping,&rdquo; Tony said, clearing his plate and digging into the fruit salad. Steve even made some watermelon and melon balls. Adorable. &ldquo;I need to replenish my supplies. For my night work.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve watched Tony eat, almost greedily devouring the chopped fruits. Suddenly the images from the movies flooded his mind, the ones of bored husbands waiting in the changing room, as their wives tried on numerous dresses, presenting themselves to their partners, whose enthusiasms kept dropping with every new outfit, opposite to the women&rsquo;s who took energy from trying on more clothes. He could picture himself doing that with Tony while being more enthusiastic, of course, and it was a tempting image, one that made his heart beat faster.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Steve nodded, feeling that they both would enjoy that. He sampled the fruit salad and scrunched his nose. &ldquo;Needs some honey,&rdquo; he stated, finding it not enough sweet.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it is great,&rdquo; Tony smiled, really enjoying the meal.</p><p>&ldquo;It will be better if we drizzle some honey on it, trust me,&rdquo; Steve said, standing up, &ldquo;you have honey?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes playfully. Seemed that Steve was the master of breakfasts and everything had to be perfect. For Tony, it was tasty as it was, but he could humor him. &ldquo;Cabinet on the left,&rdquo; he said, putting a piece of banana in his mouth and almost spitting it out in panic. &ldquo;NO! The other left!&rdquo; Tony called, but it already happened. Steve opened the cabinet and jumped to the back when the contents spilled, falling in a mess to the countertop and to the floor.</p><p>Steve stared in shock. Tony felt like crawling under the table.</p><p>The concept of snacks wasn&rsquo;t strange to Steve. Heck, back in his apartment in his own pantry, he always kept a stack of animal crackers for the days he felt nostalgic, and always had on hand a bag of salted potato chips to have something to snack on during watching TV. Having snacks was perfectly normal. But this&hellip; This was numerous bags of pretzel sticks, potato chips in five different flavors, pop tarts, sugary cereals&hellip; Clearly hidden away. And so the abundance of fresh products finally became clear.</p><p>&ldquo;This is what you usually eat?!&rdquo; Steve asked, taking in his hands a box of frosted cornflakes.</p><p>Tony groaned, almost sliding off the chair. &ldquo;In my defense, you were not supposed to see this,&rdquo; he said, sounding and looking embarrassed.</p><p>This situation could lead to many different outcomes, but the one Tony didn&rsquo;t expect was that, that Steve would start to laugh. And he was laughing, loud and clear, as hearing the best joke ever.</p><p>&ldquo;This is great,&rdquo; Steve kept laughing, tossing the box in the air, before catching it. &ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony asked, not feeling as much embarrassed as angry. Steve had too much fun in his discomfort.</p><p>&ldquo;This whole time, I thought that you were some out of this world, divine creature who is way out of my league, but you have flaws! This is great news!&rdquo; Steve continued to laugh, putting the cornflakes aside and smiling at Tony. Every time he saw Red Velvet on stage, he was completely mesmerized - her make up was flawless, she never stumbled and her voice was always clear while singing, not a single false note. She was perfect. And here he was learning that the guy under Red Velvet&rsquo;s makeup was a regular human being who liked to binge on junk food and felt insecure from time to time. In Steve&rsquo;s eyes, both Tony and Red Velvet were perfect the way they were. Tony, with his stunning appearance and wit and intelligence, had some imperfections deeply rooted in him, but they made him tangible and close. Red Velvet was a dream, but Tony was the real thing.</p><p>Somehow, Tony didn&rsquo;t share the enthusiasm and just looked confused.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; You are not disappointed in me?&rdquo; he asked, genuinely surprised. It would be so heartbreaking that Tony could be so insecure if the circumstances weren&rsquo;t so hilarious.</p><p>&ldquo;No! Of course not!&rdquo; Steve quickly assured, taking Tony&rsquo;s hand in his. &ldquo;I am just glad that I finally have a proof that you are a human being,&rdquo; he continued to laugh.</p><p>Tony grimaced, needing to come clean about one more thing. &ldquo;And what if I told you, that I ordered a cleaning company just to make my apartment presentable for you?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve stopped laughing. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just alarming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, I wanted to make a good first impression,&rdquo; Tony ducked his head down, feeling embarrassed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me, you make a great first impression,&rdquo; Steve smiled in all honesty, remembering how he had been twice stunned by Tony. First, with him as Red Velvet in the club, and then in the diner, when he showed up as himself. The first impressions were what made Steve want to meet him, but it was the things that he was learning now, that made him want to stay. &ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; he asked when Tony still refused to look up. &ldquo;Come on, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Reluctantly, Tony did so. There was still a blush on his face and Steve was sure, it wasn&rsquo;t makeup this time. A whole lot of insecurities in the brown eyes. This was so much different from when Tony was Red Velvet. Poised and strong and confident. And Steve loved them both. He wanted to be there for Tony in his strongest moments and his most vulnerable. All the time.</p><p>Words were not needed, but actions. When they kissed, it tasted tangy and delicious. And Tony was right, the fruit salad didn&rsquo;t need any honey, it was already sweet as it was.</p><p>***</p><p>The mall was crowded as usual on the weekends and Steve was surprised that they ended in the mall anyway. He expected that Tony would take him to some small shop, outside the city, where they could have all the privacy they wanted. But how it turned out, he misunderstood Tony&rsquo;s offer completely.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah,&rdquo; Steve nodded, walking after Tony into the crowded shop. It had a black sign above with the name of the shop in white, bold print and the shelves were in dark, almost black color, big signs above every cabinet indicating what products you could find. Steve guessed that the black interior was supposed to emphasize more the multicolored stock. In one hundred years, Steve wouldn&rsquo;t guess that Tony would take him to a handmade cosmetic shop. That&rsquo;s what he meant by restocking his supplies for the show. Makeup.</p><p>&ldquo;And it is all organic too!&rdquo; Tony chirped enthusiastically, rubbing some gray goop into his wrist and putting near Steve&rsquo;s nose to smell. It was a bit sweet, but also an earthy smell.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Steve asked, eyeing suspiciously a table with a tub filled with ice with different colored goops in huge containers placed on top.</p><p>&ldquo;Facial mask. This one is blueberry and chamomile oil. It calms the skin and makes it more radiant. I am gonna need some of it, but we will take it as the last thing, it needs to stay cold.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve felt a note of panic. Last thing&hellip;?</p><p>&ldquo;Steve! Keep up, please! We have a lot of things to buy!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve gritted his teeth. He threw on a brave face and trotted after Tony, holding in his hand the shopping basket.</p><p>Nourishing serum for the night. Moisturizer for the day with jojoba oil. A shampoo bar, thing Steve didn&rsquo;t even know that existed, that smelled like berries. It was just the beginning and the basket was filling up, as Tony was going from stand to stand, choosing his favorites, sometimes turning to Steve and asking him to smell things. Soon every scent started to mingle into a one, aromatic ball of perfume and he felt a beginning of a headache.</p><p>&ldquo;And this is my favorite stand!&rdquo; Tony spread his arms, standing in front of the wall with baskets filled up to the brim with colorful orbs. &ldquo;Bath bombs!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve asked, not being one to complain, but his arm started to hurt. Maybe he should have taken two baskets.</p><p>&ldquo;Bath bombs. You drop this into a bathtub and it fizzes and the water turns colorful and scented and amazing. You need to try one!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a bathtub,&rdquo; Steve said, finding himself more of a shower kind of person. Soaking in water for hours was not for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Luckily, I have a one,&rdquo; Tony said lightly, rummaging in one of the baskets, &ldquo;and it can fit in two people. You always want to take the ones that are on the bottom, they are the freshest,&rdquo; Tony said before the first sentence had a chance to sink in Steve&rsquo;s mind. Taking a bath with Tony sounded like a nice reward after this ordeal. &ldquo;You will love this one.&rdquo;</p><p>Another thing to smell. Steve faked a smile and moved closer, taking a sniff of the ball in milky blue color with the shop&rsquo;s name stamped on it. It wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It smelled sweet and subtle.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Steve asked, genuinely curious for a change.</p><p>&ldquo;Vanilla and orange blossom. I had a feeling you will like it,&rdquo; Tony smiled, adding the bath bomb to the pile in the basket.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>America&rsquo;s Sweetheart</i>. Really, Tony?&rdquo; Steve asked dryly, reading the name of the bath bomb.</p><p>Tony cooed and blew a kissy face in Steve&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;This is my favorite one,&rdquo; he said, turning back to the baskets and taking out another bomb and putting it close to Steve. It was red with white swirls and looked like it had some glitter in it, with a stamped crown on it. Steve smelled it and the fragrance was a bit stronger than the previous bomb but still pleasant. It reminded him of sweet, red apples. He read the name tag and couldn&rsquo;t help but to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Evil Queen</i>?&rdquo; he asked Tony. Someone had to have a blast coming up with all those names.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Villains have much more interesting lives than heroes. And I am definitely a queen,&rdquo; Tony joked, flopping some curls near his ear away in a playful manner.</p><p>Steve could just agree with a smile and then followed his queen on the adventure in the cosmetic shop, as the loyal knight he was.</p><p>***</p><p>The shop wasn&rsquo;t big, yet Steve felt like it was enormous. He lost count of time and felt that his back and feet started to ache, and the strong smells were starting to irritate him. He considered asking Tony if he could wait outside, but he didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the moment. It was just really getting hard for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Steve, quick question!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve turned his tired eyes to Tony, really hoping that the question was &rsquo;&lt;do you want to wait outside for me?&rsquo; By the way Tony was smiling, Steve could already say that it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;What color is better for me - this one, or this one?&rdquo; Tony asked, holding in his hands two lipsticks. He was trying to hide it, but his lips were twitching into a mocking smile, almost as if he planned to torment Steve with the task.</p><p>The joke was on him, though.</p><p>Steve put down the basket and took the two lipsticks, turning more to the light. For the inexperienced eye, both lipsticks seemed red. Steve saw the subtle differences. One was a bold, cherry color, the other a deep, rosy red. One was matt finish, the other sparkly finish.</p><p>&ldquo;I think both will look great on you,&rdquo; Steve said, and Tony almost whooped in excitement, pleased that Steve walked into such an obvious trap, &ldquo;but you usually wear sparkling materials, so it is better to go with a matte finish, to not overpower the dress. And the rose color will go better with your skin tone, than the cherry one.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony listened, staring at Steve. It all made sense and it was quite frightening.</p><p>Steve smiled, feeling that he had an upper hand in this matter and handed two lipsticks back to Tony. &ldquo;I work in an art supply store, Tony. I can tell shades of red apart,&rdquo; he explained, sounding smug and Tony smiled cheekily.</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you full of surprises,&rdquo; he purred out playfully and put the samples away. He added the rose lipstick into the basket and that made Steve feel a bit proud. Steve hoped that it would be the end for today, but Tony just trotted away to find more products.</p><p>&ldquo;Stevie?&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, Steve knew this voice. He turned around.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma?!&rdquo; he gasped, suddenly finding himself in a new situation, one that had written DANGER all over.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, honey!&rdquo; Sarah Rogers, Steve&rsquo;s mom, smiled at her son. She had blond hair and blue eyes, something Steve had inherited from her and had a petite frame. Steve had to lean down when she walked over to kiss her son&rsquo;s cheek as hello.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma, what are you doing here?&rdquo; Steve asked, suddenly very aware that he was in a cosmetic shop and that he didn&rsquo;t belong here, while his mom did.</p><p>&ldquo;And what everyone is doing here? Just a little shopping,&rdquo; she said, pointing Steve&rsquo;s attention to the few products in her basket. Her eyes widened when she saw Steve&rsquo;s brimming one. &ldquo;Or not so little,&rdquo; she said, looking confused when she noticed a lipstick displayed proudly on top and other makeup products Tony had recently picked.</p><p>Steve felt his face blushing and looked at his shoes in panic. He had no clue how to explain this all.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, this won&rsquo;t be so easy! Which blush, this one or this one?&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>Steve completely froze. Please, not now.</p><p>Tony was quick to asses the situation. He saw the family resemblance and put on a charming smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi! I am Tony,&rdquo; he said in a pleasant voice, waving his hand, &ldquo;you must be Steve&rsquo;s mom. Your son looks very similar to you, Mrs. Rogers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, call me Sarah,&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s mom replied, quickly warming up to Tony. That unfroze Steve a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Ma, Tony is&mdash;&rdquo; and Steve&rsquo;s voice got stuck again. Who? Who is Tony? A drag queen? My boyfriend? God, they never even discussed who they were for each other. Steve&rsquo;s mind whirred in panic.</p><p>&ldquo;A makeup artist,&rdquo; Tony came up with a smooth lie, which wasn&rsquo;t really a lie. &ldquo;Steve helps me to restock,&rdquo; Tony explained, and Steve only nodded, not finding his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;A makeup artist? I didn&rsquo;t wear any makeup in a long time,&rdquo; Sarah admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really have to, with your porcelain skin and beautiful cheekbones!&rdquo; Tony praised enthusiastically and Sarah laughed. Steve looked at Tony in panic. What the heck was happening. &ldquo;But if you would like to try a little bit of makeup, I will be happy to help. I have some time, and I could assist you. Think of me as your personal makeup artist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to stop you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We would love to accompany you! Right, Steve?&rdquo; still no answer. &ldquo;I know he would,&rdquo; Tony decided in Steve&rsquo;s name and took Sarah&rsquo;s basket, handing it to Steve. &ldquo;Make yourself useful, huh?&rdquo; he whispered to Steve, and the sore tone he used grounded Steve back. Feeling that he screwed up, he quietly padded after his mom and Tony, holding two baskets, Tony already hooking arms with his mom like if they were best friends, as they were discussing makeup and skin care, and Tony was charming and polite, and Steve acted like an idiot.</p><p>It was a day when Steve spent in a cosmetic shop more time than he would like to admit to, but he didn&rsquo;t notice the time fly, as the whole time he was trying to think what he would tell his mom in the end. What was his relationship with Tony? Calling him his friend seemed too little, and boyfriend was a bold word. Lover was sweet, but could also indicate other things and cause confusion. He didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t have any problems, and even if he had one, he didn&rsquo;t let it show. He made Sarah laugh and joked with her, and was eager to explain every product and find the most suitable ones for her. He even let her use his discount, which was a sweet gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to join us for lunch?&rdquo; Tony asked when the three of them walked out of the shop. He enjoyed Sarah&rsquo;s company, and Steve had a nasty feeling that Tony liked her more than him at this particular moment.</p><p>&ldquo;You are so sweet, Tony,&rdquo; Sarah laughed, and Steve could just silently agree, feeling like a fool. &ldquo;I will leave you boys alone, now. I really want to get home and try that facial mask you recommended to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just remember to gently coat the skin, don&rsquo;t work it in,&rdquo; Tony said, showing on his face to which areas apply the mask. &ldquo;Fifteen minutes is plenty of time to let it sit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know a lot about skincare,&rdquo; Sarah praised, impressed by Tony&rsquo;s knowledge.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Tony fluttered his long eyelashes playfully, taking the compliment with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;It was lovely seeing you both,&rdquo; Sarah turned to Steve and Steve leaned down on automat, letting his mom kiss his cheek. Then she turned to Tony and granted him with the same motherly affection.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Sarah!&rdquo; Tony said, waving to Steve&rsquo;s mom with a smile, as she began to walk away.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, ma,&rdquo; Steve said quietly, feeling like hiding into the floor. When his mom mingled with the crowd, Tony slid his arm under Steve&rsquo;s and urged him to walk.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, we have like forty-five minutes to get back before I have to put the facial masks in the fridge. Now when I think about it, we actually don&rsquo;t have the time to eat, maybe takeaway?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm, how about some fried rice? Or maybe sushi! Do you like sushi? I could eat some crab&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Steve stopped, making someone behind him almost collided into his back. There was some angry cursing, but Steve didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to it.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony also stopped, widening his eyes. &ldquo;Not in the mood for sushi?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve rubbed his face. It was almost as if Tony had planned to let his guilt consume him and ignore the topic.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, about what happened&hellip; I am sorry, I went so silent, I just&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it is okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is?&rdquo; Steve asked, looking confused at Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Tony shrugged, not considering it a big deal. &ldquo;I understand. Really.&rdquo;</p><p>It was supposed to be comforting, but something in the tone of Tony&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t seem right.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, what do you understand?&rdquo; Steve asked, feeling that they might be not on the same page.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand you not telling your mom who I am. It is okay. Your mom is a sweet lady, but I think that hearing that her son is hanging out with a drag queen is beyond her limits.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh no. This was much worse than Steve thought.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not ashamed of being with you!&rdquo; Steve yelled, attracting some attention to them. Tony blinked, slightly taken aback.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; Tony asked, his voice sounding a bit cold.</p><p>&ldquo;God, Tony,&rdquo; Steve rubbed his face again. &ldquo;I just panicked, okay? It doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything with you being who you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is complicated. I never told my mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yhm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And we never discussed it, you know? We keep seeing each other, but I don&rsquo;t know what it makes us&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, back in my days, if you kissed and slept with someone on a regular and exclusive basis, it made you date them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve stared.</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes, not in the playful, dramatic way he used to sometimes, but as if he really considered Steve dense. &ldquo;Dating? You know, two people meeting with each other? I know that gay people have an opinion of sleeping around, but I always was a fan of monogamy once I am in relationship with someone, so correct me if I am wrong, because maybe it is just one-sided and I would like to know if it is&mdash;&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s blabbing was interrupted, when Steve pressed him close and quietened with a kiss. In the middle of the mall. With people passing by. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but blush.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, well,&rdquo; Tony said when Steve let him go, looking adorably shy. &ldquo;Back in my days, people tried to stay more covert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but times change,&rdquo; Steve shrugged, hooking their arms together and walking with Tony to the food court, his steps lighter than ever. &ldquo;And I hate raw fish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fried rice then,&rdquo; Tony decided, still feeling a bit weak in the knees after the kiss. But it felt good. As if they made it official. It felt even more than good.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready for this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We really have to do this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, it is just the two of us. I won&rsquo;t tell anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I won&rsquo;t do it, you will pester me until I agree, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know me so well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. Let&rsquo;s be over with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smiled, putting his fingers into the container and getting some gray goop out. He rubbed it between his palms and carefully applied to Steve&rsquo;s whole face.</p><p>&ldquo;Your skin will thank me later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Steve griped, although it did feel kinda nice. Cooling. And the smell was nice too.</p><p>&ldquo;There. Now do me,&rdquo; Tony handed Steve the container, smiling adorably. Steve repeated what Tony did to him, careful to not coat any unruly hair trying to make their way out of the headband. He was with Tony in his bathroom, somehow agreeing to a home spa evening. &ldquo;Should I put it on your beard?&rdquo; Steve asked, unsure what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just try to work it in the skin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said to not work it in the skin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only when you have a smooth face. Like yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be jealous once I grow a beard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like how you look now.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled, sensing the honesty in Tony&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;And I like how you look now,&rdquo; he booped Tony on the nose playfully, meaning the tiny bathrobe and nothing else underneath. Steve&rsquo;s outfit was even skimpier as it consisted only of a towel around his hips.</p><p>Tony giggled, and it was a cute reaction he always had whenever Steve kissed or tapped on his nose. Almost as if the tip of his nose was ticklish.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready for your first bath bomb bath?&rdquo; Tony asked excitedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Steve kept smiling because Tony looked so happy. It was somehow contagious.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to be &rsquo;<i>America&rsquo;s sweetheart</i> or <i>The Evil Queen</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about both? Can we do that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uhmmm. We can try. I just hope my bathtub won&rsquo;t explode.&rdquo;</p><p>In the end, Steve had to admit that home spa evenings were not so bad. And bath bombs were pretty amazing.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>song lyrics - <i>Your Move</i> from <i>The Futurist</i> by Robert Downey Jr</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/178016992529/the-pitted-olive-part-3\">&lt;&ndash;</a> previous part &hellip;..&nbsp;next part <a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/180929584104/the-pitted-olive-part-5\">&mdash;&gt;&nbsp;</a></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br /></p><p><b>tag list</b></p><p>(if you want to be tagged for updates in this series, send me an ask and I will add your username below)</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miYHPaykxNNCM2iUdGMUTRQ\">@destiel-is-classic</a>, @<a href=\"http://prithvik.tumblr.com/\">prithvik</a> , @<a href=\"http://azurixx.tumblr.com/\">azurixx</a> , &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myQWyK5tgTODVt0P6ETaulQ\">@mangakats</a>, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmDPUGGjfYW-OCBb9zvaRkQ\">@mystey-writes</a><br /></p>",

Tony skipped a bit, as if trying to find back his balance after hours on high heels and looked tired, but happy. His shows always attracted a lot of people and he loved the attention.</p>\n</p>",
