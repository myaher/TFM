I remember her saying that to Jon, but I don't recall anything like that in the books, aside from her precisely stating \"half-brother\", and I'd say her & Arya was just typical sister stuff, given how they think about each other, and maybe 50% Arya's fault (being spunky is not an excuse to wing an orange at your sister). Was her portrayal worse on GoT?",

        "body": "<p>As I brought up in my previous post, \u00a0a lot of the time when people talk about Jon and Sansa\u2019s dynamic on the show, they don\u2019t really reflect on why that \u201ctension\u201d exists as much or what it\u2019s really about. The characters keep shifting between arguing and bickering to letting down their guard for a bit and being vulnerable around each other. But there\u2019s always something left unsaid. Something that isn\u2019t acknowledged. This unlabelled \u201csomething\u201d is a number of issues related to their individual journeys, the perception of them, but also, as I noted in <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176213521082/trust-each-other-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>, it comes down to romantic framing of that tension as well using cinematic devices that goes far beyond actors\u2019 chemistry.<br/></p><p>The way this dynamic is framed narratively, the personal is political and the political is personal. The \u2018otherness\u2019 that doesn\u2019t exist in Jon and Arya\u2019s dynamic exists in Jon and Sansa\u2019s. \u00a0It\u2019s a very confusing dynamic to a person who wants to establish them as \u201ccomplete enemies\u201d or just \u201csibling rivalry\u201d (as they don\u2019t know they\u2019re cousins) because they never completely settle into that. Their biggest theme being \u2018trust each other\u2019, not because they do completely, but because they want to and struggle to be able to. In a way, it all comes back to the 7x01 script note \u201c<i>They skirt around the true tension between them; all is subtext.</i>\u201d </p><blockquote><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the late second act complication that gives way to ~~~love~~~~~.( I am amused by how the show seems to vacillate wildly between [Jon and Sansa] being secretly in love and secretly enemies.)\u201d - Todd VanDerWerff in his responses to a comment on his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">6x10 review</a></p></blockquote><p>Although I had said last time that I will be getting into discussing the characters\u2019 individual after providing the context of cinematic framing, I will be stalling that for another post it seems. This post elaborates on the way Jon and Sansa are shot creates both visual romantic tension, but also narrative tension, and how that plays a role in storytelling.</p><h2><b>The Tension between the Familiar and the Unfamiliar\u00a0</b></h2><p>As you see from Todd VanDerWerff\u2019s quote above, he describes them with two polar opposites, secretly in love and secretly enemies, that it oscillates \u201cwildly\u201d between. It\u2019s a tension of opposites. \u201cTuesdays with Morrie\u201d seems relevant to quote here.\u00a0As I go through this series while delving into more character motivations in scenes, this quote will become more relevant to explain why Jon and Sansa react the way they do.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe tension of opposites: Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn&rsquo;t. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted. A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.\u201d - Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom<br/></p></blockquote><!-- more --><p>Because of these two polar opposite descriptors\u00a0\u201csecretly in love\u201d and\u00a0\u201csecretly enemies\u201d, it creates a push and pull to their dynamic, which doesn\u2019t allow it to settle into a stable sibling-like dynamic that they want to settle into, despite never having it. It creates the feeling of the trope of \u201c<a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey\" target=\"_blank\">Will They or Won\u2019t They?</a>\u201d where even their arguments feel like <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension\" target=\"_blank\">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> or <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeAnOldMarriedCouple\" target=\"_blank\">Like An Old Married Couple</a> because of the way they are shot.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSansa and Jon proceed to get into a very <b>old-married-couple fight.</b>\u201d - Rachel Handler, <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2895137/game-of-thrones-recap-inglorious-bastards/\" target=\"_blank\">MTV 6x09 review</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWith all their bickering, one almost wonders if [Jon and Sansa] are <b>a few episodes away from getting down together</b>.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/game-of-thrones-season-7-premiere-recap\" target=\"_blank\">Bennett Madison, Vanity Fair episode 7x01 review</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cSo Jon and Sansa\u2026they\u2019re like cousins right?

It\u2019s more \u201cknown\u201d to them to not connect with each other or trust each other (and definitely not be attracted to each other). So a lot of the fighting personal insecurities aside, is about wanting a sense of going back to what they know because the entire situation feels too strange. To understand the root of this tension between Jon and Sansa, one has to go back to the very first scene of them that we see on screen. Their reunion.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe characters had not seen each other for a number of years (six seasons) and so what we discussed was that it should seem almost dream like to them, and that there would be <b>some tentativeness to their actions</b>. It was about <b>stringing along the anticipation of the reunion as long as possible</b> to <b>create the feeling of longing</b> and so that the moment they hugged would feel earned and satisfying.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-3-4-director-ama-questions-answers-2941998\" target=\"_blank\">Sackheim, Reddit Q&amp;A</a></p></blockquote><p>Of the reunions so far, it was the most emotionally rewarding despite being the most distant growing up and despite the underlying conflict between them that comes up afterward. The \u201calmost dream-like\u201d effect that Sackheim talks about shows in their reunion more than others. As Jon and Sansa still upon seeing each other, and hold eyes only on each other as Jon slowly makes his way to her and stands in front of her, still staring, unable to believe she is there. As Bran has been subsumed under the Three Eyed Raven, he is emotionally absent and anyway, Sansa breaks her disbelief with Bran much faster than she did with Jon in episode 6x04. Later, Arya comes to Winterfell with expectations of seeing Jon, who she was closest to, and finds Sansa, who she had a strained relationship, instead. Arya is met with a bit of disappointment because she had expectations. Thus, it is a bit - if not completely - underwhelming because it\u2019s visible that it is underwhelming to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe idea that after all Jon and Sansa have been through as characters, they\u2019re finally able to <b>put a foot back on solid ground</b> in terms of family and with whom that runs deeper than any other bond. It was a big moment for them and for us to see it\u201d \u201cAnd to knowing where two of them are going to go with <b>their relationship that never really meant that much before but now means so much more</b> because at this point, they\u2019re all that they have.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEgDDDMk6lI\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;D, Inside the Episode</a></p></blockquote><p>Jon and Sansa, on the other hand, because of never being close and being the first of the pack to reunite, didn\u2019t have any such high expectations. After the journeys they went through, anything from each other felt like an oasis in a desert. They fall into a strange ease and comfort, a quiet solace with moments of banter, but they also resist it. Sackheim brings up two conflicting emotions that their reunion was meant to capture: joy and fear, where the fear is overpowering and holds them back. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe only note I gave them during the scene was, \u201c<b>Hold yourself back. As much as it\u2019s joyous to see each other, you\u2019re equally as scared.</b> You don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d The operative word was fear.<b> Fear of the unknown. </b>In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene\u201d - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fgame-thrones-jon-snow-daenerys-895034&amp;t=ZWQ1NTVmM2FjYzM5NzU5OWEyY2VjNmU2Y2I3NDYxY2YzYjViN2ZhOCwwV0N6WjZTNw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aek0Dr1CXIaPxf-CrR5ZTPg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Flostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F176213521082%2Ftrust-each-other-part-1&amp;m=0\" target=\"_blank\">David Sackheim</a>, director of 6x04 on Jon and Sansa\u2019s reunion </p></blockquote><p>Sackheim\u2019s emphasis on that \u201ctentativeness\u201d and \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d in the scene is what builds tension in that scene before offering catharsis. While I do think that Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion may still capture that \u201calmost dream-like\u201d effect, because of their close relationship growing up, there would be no fear. Currently where the story left off, they are aware of each other\u2019s survival and hope to reunite at Winterfell so watching it happen might bring on the waterworks but so would it bring on pure unadulterated joy because they\u2019ve probably imagined this a number of times. There would be familiarity and complete unfaltering trust in Jon and Arya\u2019s dynamic. On the other hand, as glad as Jon and Sansa are to find one another, their mutual \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d prevents them from ever completely falling into a sibling dynamic, even when they try to build bridges. In a way because of its two conflicting feelings of joy and fear, it encompasses Faulkner\u2019s \u201cconflict in the human heart\u201d, that Martin is inspired by. This fear isn\u2019t simply because of Cat\u2019s influence on Sansa growing up, but also because of what is happening between them as they feel like almost strangers getting to know one another. </p><p>What really grips me about Sackheim\u2019s phrase \u201cFear of the unknown\u201d on a psychological level for these two characters is that it reminds me the the concept of <i>Unheimlich</i> that Freud talks about in his essay \u201cThe Uncanny\u201d. I know this might start appearing a bit too wordy, but bear with me. This is only a minute section in a larger series of posts. Just to clarify I don\u2019t think the creators in question actually read the essay, but I think it does offer some insight within the field of aesthetics, that most people seem to innately understand without reflecting on the \u201cwhy\u201d. The themes of familiarity and unfamiliarity are a part of a huge body of literature, whether in a social, political or psychological sense. </p><p>As a disclaimer, I think Freud\u2019s theories are heavily criticisable, especially on a scientific level and this is perhaps, one of the only essays that I think has worth because it\u2019s more literary and taps into themes explored in fiction. In his essay, Freud talks about the closest explanation \u201cuncanny\u201d comes from the German word <i>unheimlich,</i> which is the opposite of the word <i>heimlich</i> that means \u201chomely\u201d or familiar. So unheimlich means \u201cunhomely\u201d and unfamiliar. He also writes that fear is a fundamental part of the \u201cuncanny\u201d. Many interpret this as \u201cuncanny\u201d or <i>unheimlich</i>\u00a0to mean fear of the unfamiliar. That is how I felt Sackheim\u2019s quote connects. Of course, it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that because Jon and Sansa aren\u2019t exactly strangers because they grew up in the same vicinity in Winterfell, but they were hardly involved in each other\u2019s lives. They were part of an extended group of Starks but on the two polar opposite sides of the spectrum. Incidentally, Freud argues that the definition of the \u201cuncanny\u201d or <i>unheimlic</i>h is not so concrete. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn general we are reminded that the word \u2018<i>heimlich</i>\u2019 is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. \u2018<i>Unheimlich</i>\u2019 is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of \u2018<i>heimlich</i>\u2019, and not of the second. Sanders tells us nothing concerning a possible genetic connection between these two meanings of heimlich. On the other hand, we notice that Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the concept of the <i>Unheimlich</i>, for which we were certainly not prepared. According to him, everything is <i>unheimlich</i> that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.\u201d - \u201cThe Uncanny (1919), Freud</p></blockquote><p>So essentially, the second understanding of \u201c<i>unheimlich</i>\u201d means something familiar and hidden that is revealed. In the case of the story in question, this concept is explored through Jon and Sansa\u2019s inappropriate feelings for one another thinking of each other as half-siblings and his actual parentage that is hidden from them and the rest of the world. In a literary manner, the presence of these inappropriate attraction is them somewhere deep down knowing Jon is \u201cnot a Stark\u201d, i.e. he isn\u2019t Ned\u2019s son, and scratching on the concealed truth. There is a certain irony to the idea that Jon wonders why he is having these inappropriate Targaryen-like incestuous feelings and the truth being that he is in fact Targaryen. In literature, authors can explore a number of things that may not work in real life, like this gut feeling of infringing on some prohibited territory that would reveal the lie around which Jon\u2019s life has been wrapped around. </p><p>The fact that the show revealed Jon\u2019s parentage in the same episode where it seemed to frame his scenes with Sansa quite romantically, adds to this reading. The characters are unaware of it, but as viewers there is some, if not complete, relief offered for noticing this odd framing of two characters belonging to the House with a reputation of being too honourable. One may brush this off because Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship in season 7. But this piece of information is heavily implied a whole season before they actually meet and commit accidental incest, which is another literary trope that follows punishment. There is also a kind of irony in the fact that Jon distances himself from Sansa to avoid committing incest, and because of his lack of knowledge on his parentage commits it anyway. In the larger scheme of things, his feelings for Sansa as a cousin would not be considered wrong in Westeros and many a match were made around cousin marriages. </p><p>Of course, the show doesn\u2019t explicitly acknowledge it and the crew remains silent on it even more than the cast, which is unsure at best and otherwise describing this tension as \u201csibling rivalry\u201d. But as I pointed out in my last post, it\u2019s not about the actors\u2019 chemistry. It\u2019s about their cinematic framing that uses visual romantic subtext, the methodology of which <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/171012681174/all-is-subtext-a-case-for-jon-and-sansa-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">trinuviel</a> and <a href=\"http://bitchcakegreen.tumblr.com/tagged/directorial+analysis/page/2\" target=\"_blank\">bitchcakegreen</a> have talked about in their posts. It requires a large number of people involved to actually deliver this result so a lot of people, including directors of completely different episodes, were required to maintain this consistency. It\u2019s not only shippers who noted this, but a number of reviewers who didn\u2019t exactly want it to happen and were confused by the \u201cframing\u201d and the \u201cway it was shot\u201d. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI definitely think they\u2019re building <b>some sort of romantic something</b> between the two, and I\u2019m not sure where any of it is supposed to be headed. But it\u2019s <b>definitely strange</b>! (In particular, they seem to be <b>deliberately framing</b> the two as roughly analogous to Ned and Cat.)\u201d - Todd VanDerWerff in response to his comments on his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">6x10 review</a>. </p></blockquote><p>The show seems to make them visually nod to a number of positive romantic dynamics like Ned/Cat, Jaime/Brienne, Sam/Gilly, Robb/Talisa, and even a bit of Greyworm/Missandei. Many of these are noted by reviewers. That\u2019s a lot of romantic dynamics to visually echo if you want this relationship to be read as platonic. If that wasn\u2019t enough, one of the oddest things is that in the last episode where Jon and Sansa shared scenes together, the show nodded to not only Ned\u2019s choke-hold of Littlefinger over Cat in season 1, but also Jaime and Brienne\u2019s season 6 goodbye. Mark Mylod who was the director episode 7x02, also directed episode 6x08, where Jaime and Brienne had their goodbye scene. That\u2019s alluding to two romantic dynamics in two back-to-back scenes, while the characters\u2019 intentions behind certain actions are left ambiguous. It\u2019s subtle, like the quiet chemistry involved in couples framed to be in the initial stages of courtship in period dramas. There is teasing banter and shows of affection, but there is also a hesitation and holding back in these moments apart from those that involve arguments.\u00a0</p><p>This continues with Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">odd reactions</a> to Sansa\u2019s \u201csuitors\u201d mentioning her, the goodbye scene at Dragonstone where Jorah looks back at Dany while Jon doesn\u2019t, their confusing titles as Jon is KITN but not Lord of Winterfell as Sansa is Lady (and acting Lord) of Winterfell because of her claim, the use of the Lord\u2019s chambers as a narrative device, and people questioning the nature of Sansa\u2019s feelings towards Jon assuming her hesitation to be about power rather than something else. Somehow, because of the other dynamics coming into the fold while Jon and Sansa are distanced, their moments of connection are spelt out even more. Jon and Sansa argued and kept things from each other, but ultimately they still had conversations where they cleared the air and also let down their guard a little. They allowed themselves a few moments of vulnerability and offering each other validation despite their disagreements. This did not happen with Sansa and Arya, who had more of a relationship growing up than Jon and Sansa. \u00a0</p><p>A number of people\u2019s reactions come with the descriptors\u00a0\u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d and a hesitation to completely believe.\u00a0The fact that it comes off strange may be deliberate as the characters never really act on anything or acknowledge this romantic tension and the audience is left hanging. It leaves one with a feeling of unease because one doesn\u2019t know what to expect and if it is truly happening. It\u2019s kind of a continuation of Sackheim\u2019s \u201c<i>stringing along the anticipation [&hellip;] as long as possible to create a feeling of longing</i>\u201d which is built around that tentativeness of their actions. Even when it is pushed to the background. Four directors after Sackheim carry on this tension, where they share scenes (and more if you count related scenes). There is a \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d, an indefinable, intrinsic feeling to it all. The trained viewer, who has consumed a lot of visual-audio content, can see it - even if they don\u2019t want to - because of internalising the language of film. Even the argument about it as having no basis in books is very contestable.\u00a0</p><p>The result is that as much as the characters do not know what to expect, the audience doesn\u2019t either. So, it is easier to fall into the alternative explanation that the narrative acknowledges in the text even when it doesn\u2019t answer everything about the subtext. Certain actions may be dismissed as a coincidence, but it starts feeling more strange when the occurences keep building and even make narrative (and political) sense. Therefore, not only are the characters made to undergo this \u201cuncanny\u201d experience so is the audience made to, even when they know the truth about Jon\u2019s parentage and how it could change everything that one assumed about the story before. It crosses the boundary of shipping this dynamic to become about people deep down needing to know if they were right about what the show was telling them via framing. It\u2019s the same kind of relief that people who thought episode 6x10 undoubtedly framed them romantically felt after Jon\u2019s parentage reveal later in the episode.\u00a0</p><p>I cannot know the ending of the story, of course, but I\u2019ve said multiple times that season 7 didn\u2019t end possibilities. Rather made it more of an inevitable political requirement should he survive. Politics, as loosely as D&amp;D follow it, is at the crux of the story. Everything stands because of the end goal is headed. As much as I\u2019d like to go into scene break-downs already, because Jon and Dany have occurred in the story, it is difficult to avoid discussing their very own framing. In the next post, I will talk about the visual juxtaposition of Jon/Dany and Jon/Sansa within the same season as they share two directors for different episodes. </p><p>(to be continued\u2026)</p><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176408436332/trust-each-other-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></p>",

It\u2019s more \u201cknown\u201d to them to not connect with each other or trust each other (and definitely not be attracted to each other). So a lot of the fighting personal insecurities aside, is about wanting a sense of going back to what they know because the entire situation feels too strange. To understand the root of this tension between Jon and Sansa, one has to go back to the very first scene of them that we see on screen. Their reunion.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe characters had not seen each other for a number of years (six seasons) and so what we discussed was that it should seem almost dream like to them, and that there would be <b>some tentativeness to their actions</b>. It was about <b>stringing along the anticipation of the reunion as long as possible</b> to <b>create the feeling of longing</b> and so that the moment they hugged would feel earned and satisfying.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-3-4-director-ama-questions-answers-2941998\" target=\"_blank\">Sackheim, Reddit Q&amp;A</a></p></blockquote><p>Of the reunions so far, it was the most emotionally rewarding despite being the most distant growing up and despite the underlying conflict between them that comes up afterward. The \u201calmost dream-like\u201d effect that Sackheim talks about shows in their reunion more than others. As Jon and Sansa still upon seeing each other, and hold eyes only on each other as Jon slowly makes his way to her and stands in front of her, still staring, unable to believe she is there. As Bran has been subsumed under the Three Eyed Raven, he is emotionally absent and anyway, Sansa breaks her disbelief with Bran much faster than she did with Jon in episode 6x04. Later, Arya comes to Winterfell with expectations of seeing Jon, who she was closest to, and finds Sansa, who she had a strained relationship, instead. Arya is met with a bit of disappointment because she had expectations. Thus, it is a bit - if not completely - underwhelming because it\u2019s visible that it is underwhelming to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe idea that after all Jon and Sansa have been through as characters, they\u2019re finally able to <b>put a foot back on solid ground</b> in terms of family and with whom that runs deeper than any other bond. It was a big moment for them and for us to see it\u201d \u201cAnd to knowing where two of them are going to go with <b>their relationship that never really meant that much before but now means so much more</b> because at this point, they\u2019re all that they have.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEgDDDMk6lI\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;D, Inside the Episode</a></p></blockquote><p>Jon and Sansa, on the other hand, because of never being close and being the first of the pack to reunite, didn\u2019t have any such high expectations. After the journeys they went through, anything from each other felt like an oasis in a desert. They fall into a strange ease and comfort, a quiet solace with moments of banter, but they also resist it. Sackheim brings up two conflicting emotions that their reunion was meant to capture: joy and fear, where the fear is overpowering and holds them back. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe only note I gave them during the scene was, \u201c<b>Hold yourself back. As much as it\u2019s joyous to see each other, you\u2019re equally as scared.</b> You don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d The operative word was fear.<b> Fear of the unknown. </b>In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene\u201d - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fgame-thrones-jon-snow-daenerys-895034&amp;t=ZWQ1NTVmM2FjYzM5NzU5OWEyY2VjNmU2Y2I3NDYxY2YzYjViN2ZhOCwwV0N6WjZTNw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aek0Dr1CXIaPxf-CrR5ZTPg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Flostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F176213521082%2Ftrust-each-other-part-1&amp;m=0\" target=\"_blank\">David Sackheim</a>, director of 6x04 on Jon and Sansa\u2019s reunion </p></blockquote><p>Sackheim\u2019s emphasis on that \u201ctentativeness\u201d and \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d in the scene is what builds tension in that scene before offering catharsis. While I do think that Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion may still capture that \u201calmost dream-like\u201d effect, because of their close relationship growing up, there would be no fear. Currently where the story left off, they are aware of each other\u2019s survival and hope to reunite at Winterfell so watching it happen might bring on the waterworks but so would it bring on pure unadulterated joy because they\u2019ve probably imagined this a number of times. There would be familiarity and complete unfaltering trust in Jon and Arya\u2019s dynamic. On the other hand, as glad as Jon and Sansa are to find one another, their mutual \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d prevents them from ever completely falling into a sibling dynamic, even when they try to build bridges. In a way because of its two conflicting feelings of joy and fear, it encompasses Faulkner\u2019s \u201cconflict in the human heart\u201d, that Martin is inspired by. This fear isn\u2019t simply because of Cat\u2019s influence on Sansa growing up, but also because of what is happening between them as they feel like almost strangers getting to know one another. </p><p>What really grips me about Sackheim\u2019s phrase \u201cFear of the unknown\u201d on a psychological level for these two characters is that it reminds me the the concept of <i>Unheimlich</i> that Freud talks about in his essay \u201cThe Uncanny\u201d. I know this might start appearing a bit too wordy, but bear with me. This is only a minute section in a larger series of posts. Just to clarify I don\u2019t think the creators in question actually read the essay, but I think it does offer some insight within the field of aesthetics, that most people seem to innately understand without reflecting on the \u201cwhy\u201d. The themes of familiarity and unfamiliarity are a part of a huge body of literature, whether in a social, political or psychological sense. </p><p>As a disclaimer, I think Freud\u2019s theories are heavily criticisable, especially on a scientific level and this is perhaps, one of the only essays that I think has worth because it\u2019s more literary and taps into themes explored in fiction. In his essay, Freud talks about the closest explanation \u201cuncanny\u201d comes from the German word <i>unheimlich,</i> which is the opposite of the word <i>heimlich</i> that means \u201chomely\u201d or familiar. So unheimlich means \u201cunhomely\u201d and unfamiliar. He also writes that fear is a fundamental part of the \u201cuncanny\u201d. Many interpret this as \u201cuncanny\u201d or <i>unheimlich</i>\u00a0to mean fear of the unfamiliar. That is how I felt Sackheim\u2019s quote connects. Of course, it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that because Jon and Sansa aren\u2019t exactly strangers because they grew up in the same vicinity in Winterfell, but they were hardly involved in each other\u2019s lives. They were part of an extended group of Starks but on the two polar opposite sides of the spectrum. Incidentally, Freud argues that the definition of the \u201cuncanny\u201d or <i>unheimlic</i>h is not so concrete. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn general we are reminded that the word \u2018<i>heimlich</i>\u2019 is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. \u2018<i>Unheimlich</i>\u2019 is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of \u2018<i>heimlich</i>\u2019, and not of the second. Sanders tells us nothing concerning a possible genetic connection between these two meanings of heimlich. On the other hand, we notice that Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the concept of the <i>Unheimlich</i>, for which we were certainly not prepared. According to him, everything is <i>unheimlich</i> that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.\u201d - \u201cThe Uncanny (1919), Freud</p></blockquote><p>So essentially, the second understanding of \u201c<i>unheimlich</i>\u201d means something familiar and hidden that is revealed. In the case of the story in question, this concept is explored through Jon and Sansa\u2019s inappropriate feelings for one another thinking of each other as half-siblings and his actual parentage that is hidden from them and the rest of the world. In a literary manner, the presence of these inappropriate attraction is them somewhere deep down knowing Jon is \u201cnot a Stark\u201d, i.e. he isn\u2019t Ned\u2019s son, and scratching on the concealed truth. There is a certain irony to the idea that Jon wonders why he is having these inappropriate Targaryen-like incestuous feelings and the truth being that he is in fact Targaryen. In literature, authors can explore a number of things that may not work in real life, like this gut feeling of infringing on some prohibited territory that would reveal the lie around which Jon\u2019s life has been wrapped around. </p><p>The fact that the show revealed Jon\u2019s parentage in the same episode where it seemed to frame his scenes with Sansa quite romantically, adds to this reading. The characters are unaware of it, but as viewers there is some, if not complete, relief offered for noticing this odd framing of two characters belonging to the House with a reputation of being too honourable. One may brush this off because Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship in season 7. But this piece of information is heavily implied a whole season before they actually meet and commit accidental incest, which is another literary trope that follows punishment. There is also a kind of irony in the fact that Jon distances himself from Sansa to avoid committing incest, and because of his lack of knowledge on his parentage commits it anyway. In the larger scheme of things, his feelings for Sansa as a cousin would not be considered wrong in Westeros and many a match were made around cousin marriages. </p><p>Of course, the show doesn\u2019t explicitly acknowledge it and the crew remains silent on it even more than the cast, which is unsure at best and otherwise describing this tension as \u201csibling rivalry\u201d. But as I pointed out in my last post, it\u2019s not about the actors\u2019 chemistry. It\u2019s about their cinematic framing that uses visual romantic subtext, the methodology of which <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/171012681174/all-is-subtext-a-case-for-jon-and-sansa-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">trinuviel</a> and <a href=\"http://bitchcakegreen.tumblr.com/tagged/directorial+analysis/page/2\" target=\"_blank\">bitchcakegreen</a> have talked about in their posts. It requires a large number of people involved to actually deliver this result so a lot of people, including directors of completely different episodes, were required to maintain this consistency. It\u2019s not only shippers who noted this, but a number of reviewers who didn\u2019t exactly want it to happen and were confused by the \u201cframing\u201d and the \u201cway it was shot\u201d. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI definitely think they\u2019re building <b>some sort of romantic something</b> between the two, and I\u2019m not sure where any of it is supposed to be headed. But it\u2019s <b>definitely strange</b>! (In particular, they seem to be <b>deliberately framing</b> the two as roughly analogous to Ned and Cat.)\u201d - Todd VanDerWerff in response to his comments on his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">6x10 review</a>. </p></blockquote><p>The show seems to make them visually nod to a number of positive romantic dynamics like Ned/Cat, Jaime/Brienne, Sam/Gilly, Robb/Talisa, and even a bit of Greyworm/Missandei. Many of these are noted by reviewers. That\u2019s a lot of romantic dynamics to visually echo if you want this relationship to be read as platonic. If that wasn\u2019t enough, one of the oddest things is that in the last episode where Jon and Sansa shared scenes together, the show nodded to not only Ned\u2019s choke-hold of Littlefinger over Cat in season 1, but also Jaime and Brienne\u2019s season 6 goodbye. Mark Mylod who was the director episode 7x02, also directed episode 6x08, where Jaime and Brienne had their goodbye scene. That\u2019s alluding to two romantic dynamics in two back-to-back scenes, while the characters\u2019 intentions behind certain actions are left ambiguous. It\u2019s subtle, like the quiet chemistry involved in couples framed to be in the initial stages of courtship in period dramas. There is teasing banter and shows of affection, but there is also a hesitation and holding back in these moments apart from those that involve arguments.\u00a0</p><p>This continues with Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">odd reactions</a> to Sansa\u2019s \u201csuitors\u201d mentioning her, the goodbye scene at Dragonstone where Jorah looks back at Dany while Jon doesn\u2019t, their confusing titles as Jon is KITN but not Lord of Winterfell as Sansa is Lady (and acting Lord) of Winterfell because of her claim, the use of the Lord\u2019s chambers as a narrative device, and people questioning the nature of Sansa\u2019s feelings towards Jon assuming her hesitation to be about power rather than something else. Somehow, because of the other dynamics coming into the fold while Jon and Sansa are distanced, their moments of connection are spelt out even more. Jon and Sansa argued and kept things from each other, but ultimately they still had conversations where they cleared the air and also let down their guard a little. They allowed themselves a few moments of vulnerability and offering each other validation despite their disagreements. This did not happen with Sansa and Arya, who had more of a relationship growing up than Jon and Sansa. \u00a0</p><p>A number of people\u2019s reactions come with the descriptors\u00a0\u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d and a hesitation to completely believe.\u00a0The fact that it comes off strange may be deliberate as the characters never really act on anything or acknowledge this romantic tension and the audience is left hanging. It leaves one with a feeling of unease because one doesn\u2019t know what to expect and if it is truly happening. It\u2019s kind of a continuation of Sackheim\u2019s \u201c<i>stringing along the anticipation [\u2026] as long as possible to create a feeling of longing</i>\u201d which is built around that tentativeness of their actions. Even when it is pushed to the background. Four directors after Sackheim carry on this tension, where they share scenes (and more if you count related scenes). There is a \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d, an indefinable, intrinsic feeling to it all. The trained viewer, who has consumed a lot of visual-audio content, can see it - even if they don\u2019t want to - because of internalising the language of film. Even the argument about it as having no basis in books is very contestable.\u00a0</p><p>The result is that as much as the characters do not know what to expect, the audience doesn\u2019t either. So, it is easier to fall into the alternative explanation that the narrative acknowledges in the text even when it doesn\u2019t answer everything about the subtext. Certain actions may be dismissed as a coincidence, but it starts feeling more strange when the occurences keep building and even make narrative (and political) sense. Therefore, not only are the characters made to undergo this \u201cuncanny\u201d experience so is the audience made to, even when they know the truth about Jon\u2019s parentage and how it could change everything that one assumed about the story before. It crosses the boundary of shipping this dynamic to become about people deep down needing to know if they were right about what the show was telling them via framing. It\u2019s the same kind of relief that people who thought episode 6x10 undoubtedly framed them romantically felt after Jon\u2019s parentage reveal later in the episode.\u00a0</p><p>I cannot know the ending of the story, of course, but I\u2019ve said multiple times that season 7 didn\u2019t end possibilities. Rather made it more of an inevitable political requirement should he survive. Politics, as loosely as D&amp;D follow it, is at the crux of the story. Everything stands because of the end goal is headed. As much as I\u2019d like to go into scene break-downs already, because Jon and Dany have occurred in the story, it is difficult to avoid discussing their very own framing. In the next post, I will talk about the visual juxtaposition of Jon/Dany and Jon/Sansa within the same season as they share two directors for different episodes. </p><p>(to be continued\u2026)</p><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176408436332/trust-each-other-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></p>",

The characters keep shifting between arguing and bickering to letting down their guard for a bit and being vulnerable around each other. But there\u2019s always something left unsaid. Something that isn\u2019t acknowledged. This unlabelled \u201csomething\u201d is a number of issues related to their individual journeys, the perception of them, but also, as I noted in <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176213521082/trust-each-other-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>, it comes down to romantic framing of that tension as well using cinematic devices that goes far beyond actors\u2019 chemistry.<br></p><p>The way this dynamic is framed narratively, the personal is political and the political is personal. The \u2018otherness\u2019 that doesn\u2019t exist in Jon and Arya\u2019s dynamic exists in Jon and Sansa\u2019s. \u00a0It\u2019s a very confusing dynamic to a person who wants to establish them as \u201ccomplete enemies\u201d or just \u201csibling rivalry\u201d (as they don\u2019t know they\u2019re cousins) because they never completely settle into that. Their biggest theme being \u2018trust each other\u2019, not because they do completely, but because they want to and struggle to be able to. In a way, it all comes back to the 7x01 script note \u201c<i>They skirt around the true tension between them; all is subtext.</i>\u201d </p><blockquote><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the late second act complication that gives way to ~~~love~~~~~.( I am amused by how the show seems to vacillate wildly between [Jon and Sansa] being secretly in love and secretly enemies.)\u201d - Todd VanDerWerff in his responses to a comment on his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">6x10 review</a></p></blockquote><p>Although I had said last time that I will be getting into discussing the characters\u2019 individual after providing the context of cinematic framing, I will be stalling that for another post it seems. This post elaborates on the way Jon and Sansa are shot creates both visual romantic tension, but also narrative tension, and how that plays a role in storytelling.</p><h2><b>The Tension between the Familiar and the Unfamiliar\u00a0</b></h2><p>As you see from Todd VanDerWerff\u2019s quote above, he describes them with two polar opposites, secretly in love and secretly enemies, that it oscillates \u201cwildly\u201d between. It\u2019s a tension of opposites. \u201cTuesdays with Morrie\u201d seems relevant to quote here.\u00a0As I go through this series while delving into more character motivations in scenes, this quote will become more relevant to explain why Jon and Sansa react the way they do.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe tension of opposites: Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn\u2019t. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted. A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.\u201d - Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom<br></p></blockquote>[[MORE]]<p>Because of these two polar opposite descriptors\u00a0\u201csecretly in love\u201d and\u00a0\u201csecretly enemies\u201d, it creates a push and pull to their dynamic, which doesn\u2019t allow it to settle into a stable sibling-like dynamic that they want to settle into, despite never having it.

It\u2019s more \u201cknown\u201d to them to not connect with each other or trust each other (and definitely not be attracted to each other). So a lot of the fighting personal insecurities aside, is about wanting a sense of going back to what they know because the entire situation feels too strange. To understand the root of this tension between Jon and Sansa, one has to go back to the very first scene of them that we see on screen. Their reunion.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe characters had not seen each other for a number of years (six seasons) and so what we discussed was that it should seem almost dream like to them, and that there would be <b>some tentativeness to their actions</b>. It was about <b>stringing along the anticipation of the reunion as long as possible</b> to <b>create the feeling of longing</b> and so that the moment they hugged would feel earned and satisfying.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-3-4-director-ama-questions-answers-2941998\" target=\"_blank\">Sackheim, Reddit Q&amp;A</a></p></blockquote><p>Of the reunions so far, it was the most emotionally rewarding despite being the most distant growing up and despite the underlying conflict between them that comes up afterward. The \u201calmost dream-like\u201d effect that Sackheim talks about shows in their reunion more than others. As Jon and Sansa still upon seeing each other, and hold eyes only on each other as Jon slowly makes his way to her and stands in front of her, still staring, unable to believe she is there. As Bran has been subsumed under the Three Eyed Raven, he is emotionally absent and anyway, Sansa breaks her disbelief with Bran much faster than she did with Jon in episode 6x04. Later, Arya comes to Winterfell with expectations of seeing Jon, who she was closest to, and finds Sansa, who she had a strained relationship, instead. Arya is met with a bit of disappointment because she had expectations. Thus, it is a bit - if not completely - underwhelming because it\u2019s visible that it is underwhelming to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe idea that after all Jon and Sansa have been through as characters, they\u2019re finally able to <b>put a foot back on solid ground</b> in terms of family and with whom that runs deeper than any other bond. It was a big moment for them and for us to see it\u201d \u201cAnd to knowing where two of them are going to go with <b>their relationship that never really meant that much before but now means so much more</b> because at this point, they\u2019re all that they have.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEgDDDMk6lI\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;D, Inside the Episode</a></p></blockquote><p>Jon and Sansa, on the other hand, because of never being close and being the first of the pack to reunite, didn\u2019t have any such high expectations. After the journeys they went through, anything from each other felt like an oasis in a desert. They fall into a strange ease and comfort, a quiet solace with moments of banter, but they also resist it. Sackheim brings up two conflicting emotions that their reunion was meant to capture: joy and fear, where the fear is overpowering and holds them back. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe only note I gave them during the scene was, \u201c<b>Hold yourself back. As much as it\u2019s joyous to see each other, you\u2019re equally as scared.</b> You don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d The operative word was fear.<b> Fear of the unknown. </b>In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene\u201d - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fgame-thrones-jon-snow-daenerys-895034&amp;t=ZWQ1NTVmM2FjYzM5NzU5OWEyY2VjNmU2Y2I3NDYxY2YzYjViN2ZhOCwwV0N6WjZTNw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aek0Dr1CXIaPxf-CrR5ZTPg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Flostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F176213521082%2Ftrust-each-other-part-1&amp;m=0\" target=\"_blank\">David Sackheim</a>, director of 6x04 on Jon and Sansa\u2019s reunion </p></blockquote><p>Sackheim\u2019s emphasis on that \u201ctentativeness\u201d and \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d in the scene is what builds tension in that scene before offering catharsis. While I do think that Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion may still capture that \u201calmost dream-like\u201d effect, because of their close relationship growing up, there would be no fear. Currently where the story left off, they are aware of each other\u2019s survival and hope to reunite at Winterfell so watching it happen might bring on the waterworks but so would it bring on pure unadulterated joy because they\u2019ve probably imagined this a number of times. There would be familiarity and complete unfaltering trust in Jon and Arya\u2019s dynamic. On the other hand, as glad as Jon and Sansa are to find one another, their mutual \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d prevents them from ever completely falling into a sibling dynamic, even when they try to build bridges. In a way because of its two conflicting feelings of joy and fear, it encompasses Faulkner\u2019s \u201cconflict in the human heart\u201d, that Martin is inspired by. This fear isn\u2019t simply because of Cat\u2019s influence on Sansa growing up, but also because of what is happening between them as they feel like almost strangers getting to know one another. </p><p>What really grips me about Sackheim\u2019s phrase \u201cFear of the unknown\u201d on a psychological level for these two characters is that it reminds me the the concept of <i>Unheimlich</i> that Freud talks about in his essay \u201cThe Uncanny\u201d. I know this might start appearing a bit too wordy, but bear with me. This is only a minute section in a larger series of posts. Just to clarify I don\u2019t think the creators in question actually read the essay, but I think it does offer some insight within the field of aesthetics, that most people seem to innately understand without reflecting on the \u201cwhy\u201d. The themes of familiarity and unfamiliarity are a part of a huge body of literature, whether in a social, political or psychological sense. </p><p>As a disclaimer, I think Freud\u2019s theories are heavily criticisable, especially on a scientific level and this is perhaps, one of the only essays that I think has worth because it\u2019s more literary and taps into themes explored in fiction. In his essay, Freud talks about the closest explanation \u201cuncanny\u201d comes from the German word <i>unheimlich,</i> which is the opposite of the word <i>heimlich</i> that means \u201chomely\u201d or familiar. So unheimlich means \u201cunhomely\u201d and unfamiliar. He also writes that fear is a fundamental part of the \u201cuncanny\u201d. Many interpret this as \u201cuncanny\u201d or <i>unheimlich</i>\u00a0to mean fear of the unfamiliar. That is how I felt Sackheim\u2019s quote connects. Of course, it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that because Jon and Sansa aren\u2019t exactly strangers because they grew up in the same vicinity in Winterfell, but they were hardly involved in each other\u2019s lives. They were part of an extended group of Starks but on the two polar opposite sides of the spectrum. Incidentally, Freud argues that the definition of the \u201cuncanny\u201d or <i>unheimlic</i>h is not so concrete. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cIn general we are reminded that the word \u2018<i>heimlich</i>\u2019 is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. \u2018<i>Unheimlich</i>\u2019 is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of \u2018<i>heimlich</i>\u2019, and not of the second. Sanders tells us nothing concerning a possible genetic connection between these two meanings of heimlich. On the other hand, we notice that Schelling says something which throws quite a new light on the concept of the <i>Unheimlich</i>, for which we were certainly not prepared. According to him, everything is <i>unheimlich</i> that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light.\u201d - \u201cThe Uncanny (1919), Freud</p></blockquote><p>So essentially, the second understanding of \u201c<i>unheimlich</i>\u201d means something familiar and hidden that is revealed. In the case of the story in question, this concept is explored through Jon and Sansa\u2019s inappropriate feelings for one another thinking of each other as half-siblings and his actual parentage that is hidden from them and the rest of the world. In a literary manner, the presence of these inappropriate attraction is them somewhere deep down knowing Jon is \u201cnot a Stark\u201d, i.e. he isn\u2019t Ned\u2019s son, and scratching on the concealed truth. There is a certain irony to the idea that Jon wonders why he is having these inappropriate Targaryen-like incestuous feelings and the truth being that he is in fact Targaryen. In literature, authors can explore a number of things that may not work in real life, like this gut feeling of infringing on some prohibited territory that would reveal the lie around which Jon\u2019s life has been wrapped around. </p><p>The fact that the show revealed Jon\u2019s parentage in the same episode where it seemed to frame his scenes with Sansa quite romantically, adds to this reading. The characters are unaware of it, but as viewers there is some, if not complete, relief offered for noticing this odd framing of two characters belonging to the House with a reputation of being too honourable. One may brush this off because Jon and Dany\u2019s relationship in season 7. But this piece of information is heavily implied a whole season before they actually meet and commit accidental incest, which is another literary trope that follows punishment. There is also a kind of irony in the fact that Jon distances himself from Sansa to avoid committing incest, and because of his lack of knowledge on his parentage commits it anyway. In the larger scheme of things, his feelings for Sansa as a cousin would not be considered wrong in Westeros and many a match were made around cousin marriages. </p><p>Of course, the show doesn\u2019t explicitly acknowledge it and the crew remains silent on it even more than the cast, which is unsure at best and otherwise describing this tension as \u201csibling rivalry\u201d. But as I pointed out in my last post, it\u2019s not about the actors\u2019 chemistry. It\u2019s about their cinematic framing that uses visual romantic subtext, the methodology of which <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/171012681174/all-is-subtext-a-case-for-jon-and-sansa-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">trinuviel</a> and <a href=\"http://bitchcakegreen.tumblr.com/tagged/directorial+analysis/page/2\" target=\"_blank\">bitchcakegreen</a> have talked about in their posts. It requires a large number of people involved to actually deliver this result so a lot of people, including directors of completely different episodes, were required to maintain this consistency. It\u2019s not only shippers who noted this, but a number of reviewers who didn\u2019t exactly want it to happen and were confused by the \u201cframing\u201d and the \u201cway it was shot\u201d. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cI definitely think they\u2019re building <b>some sort of romantic something</b> between the two, and I\u2019m not sure where any of it is supposed to be headed. But it\u2019s <b>definitely strange</b>! (In particular, they seem to be <b>deliberately framing</b> the two as roughly analogous to Ned and Cat.)\u201d - Todd VanDerWerff in response to his comments on his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">6x10 review</a>. </p></blockquote><p>The show seems to make them visually nod to a number of positive romantic dynamics like Ned/Cat, Jaime/Brienne, Sam/Gilly, Robb/Talisa, and even a bit of Greyworm/Missandei. Many of these are noted by reviewers. That\u2019s a lot of romantic dynamics to visually echo if you want this relationship to be read as platonic. If that wasn\u2019t enough, one of the oddest things is that in the last episode where Jon and Sansa shared scenes together, the show nodded to not only Ned\u2019s choke-hold of Littlefinger over Cat in season 1, but also Jaime and Brienne\u2019s season 6 goodbye. Mark Mylod who was the director episode 7x02, also directed episode 6x08, where Jaime and Brienne had their goodbye scene. That\u2019s alluding to two romantic dynamics in two back-to-back scenes, while the characters\u2019 intentions behind certain actions are left ambiguous. It\u2019s subtle, like the quiet chemistry involved in couples framed to be in the initial stages of courtship in period dramas. There is teasing banter and shows of affection, but there is also a hesitation and holding back in these moments apart from those that involve arguments.\u00a0</p><p>This continues with Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">odd reactions</a> to Sansa\u2019s \u201csuitors\u201d mentioning her, the goodbye scene at Dragonstone where Jorah looks back at Dany while Jon doesn\u2019t, their confusing titles as Jon is KITN but not Lord of Winterfell as Sansa is Lady (and acting Lord) of Winterfell because of her claim, the use of the Lord\u2019s chambers as a narrative device, and people questioning the nature of Sansa\u2019s feelings towards Jon assuming her hesitation to be about power rather than something else. Somehow, because of the other dynamics coming into the fold while Jon and Sansa are distanced, their moments of connection are spelt out even more. Jon and Sansa argued and kept things from each other, but ultimately they still had conversations where they cleared the air and also let down their guard a little. They allowed themselves a few moments of vulnerability and offering each other validation despite their disagreements. This did not happen with Sansa and Arya, who had more of a relationship growing up than Jon and Sansa. \u00a0</p><p>A number of people\u2019s reactions come with the descriptors\u00a0\u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d and a hesitation to completely believe.\u00a0The fact that it comes off strange may be deliberate as the characters never really act on anything or acknowledge this romantic tension and the audience is left hanging. It leaves one with a feeling of unease because one doesn\u2019t know what to expect and if it is truly happening. It\u2019s kind of a continuation of Sackheim\u2019s \u201c<i>stringing along the anticipation [\u2026] as long as possible to create a feeling of longing</i>\u201d which is built around that tentativeness of their actions. Even when it is pushed to the background. Four directors after Sackheim carry on this tension, where they share scenes (and more if you count related scenes). There is a \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d, an indefinable, intrinsic feeling to it all. The trained viewer, who has consumed a lot of visual-audio content, can see it - even if they don\u2019t want to - because of internalising the language of film. Even the argument about it as having no basis in books is very contestable.\u00a0</p><p>The result is that as much as the characters do not know what to expect, the audience doesn\u2019t either. So, it is easier to fall into the alternative explanation that the narrative acknowledges in the text even when it doesn\u2019t answer everything about the subtext. Certain actions may be dismissed as a coincidence, but it starts feeling more strange when the occurences keep building and even make narrative (and political) sense. Therefore, not only are the characters made to undergo this \u201cuncanny\u201d experience so is the audience made to, even when they know the truth about Jon\u2019s parentage and how it could change everything that one assumed about the story before. It crosses the boundary of shipping this dynamic to become about people deep down needing to know if they were right about what the show was telling them via framing. It\u2019s the same kind of relief that people who thought episode 6x10 undoubtedly framed them romantically felt after Jon\u2019s parentage reveal later in the episode.\u00a0</p><p>I cannot know the ending of the story, of course, but I\u2019ve said multiple times that season 7 didn\u2019t end possibilities. Rather made it more of an inevitable political requirement should he survive. Politics, as loosely as D&amp;D follow it, is at the crux of the story. Everything stands because of the end goal is headed. As much as I\u2019d like to go into scene break-downs already, because Jon and Dany have occurred in the story, it is difficult to avoid discussing their very own framing. In the next post, I will talk about the visual juxtaposition of Jon/Dany and Jon/Sansa within the same season as they share two directors for different episodes. </p><p>(to be continued\u2026)</p><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176408436332/trust-each-other-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></p>",
                "content": "<p>As I brought up in my previous post, &nbsp;a lot of the time when people talk about Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s dynamic on the show, they don&rsquo;t really reflect on why that &ldquo;tension&rdquo; exists as much or what it&rsquo;s really about. The characters keep shifting between arguing and bickering to letting down their guard for a bit and being vulnerable around each other. But there&rsquo;s always something left unsaid. Something that isn&rsquo;t acknowledged. This unlabelled &ldquo;something&rdquo; is a number of issues related to their individual journeys, the perception of them, but also, as I noted in <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176213521082/trust-each-other-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>, it comes down to romantic framing of that tension as well using cinematic devices that goes far beyond actors&rsquo; chemistry.<br /></p><p>The way this dynamic is framed narratively, the personal is political and the political is personal. The &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; that doesn&rsquo;t exist in Jon and Arya&rsquo;s dynamic exists in Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a very confusing dynamic to a person who wants to establish them as &ldquo;complete enemies&rdquo; or just &ldquo;sibling rivalry&rdquo; (as they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re cousins) because they never completely settle into that. Their biggest theme being &lsquo;trust each other&rsquo;, not because they do completely, but because they want to and struggle to be able to. In a way, it all comes back to the 7x01 script note &ldquo;<i>They skirt around the true tension between them; all is subtext.</i>&rdquo; </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the late second act complication that gives way to ~~~love~~~~~.( I am amused by how the show seems to vacillate wildly between [Jon and Sansa] being secretly in love and secretly enemies.)&rdquo; - Todd VanDerWerff in his responses to a comment on his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">6x10 review</a></p></blockquote><p>Although I had said last time that I will be getting into discussing the characters&rsquo; individual after providing the context of cinematic framing, I will be stalling that for another post it seems. This post elaborates on the way Jon and Sansa are shot creates both visual romantic tension, but also narrative tension, and how that plays a role in storytelling.</p><h2><b>The Tension between the Familiar and the Unfamiliar&nbsp;</b></h2><p>As you see from Todd VanDerWerff&rsquo;s quote above, he describes them with two polar opposites, secretly in love and secretly enemies, that it oscillates &ldquo;wildly&rdquo; between. It&rsquo;s a tension of opposites. &ldquo;Tuesdays with Morrie&rdquo; seems relevant to quote here.&nbsp;As I go through this series while delving into more character motivations in scenes, this quote will become more relevant to explain why Jon and Sansa react the way they do.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tension of opposites: Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn&rsquo;t. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted. A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.&rdquo; - Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom<br /></p></blockquote><p>Because of these two polar opposite descriptors&nbsp;&ldquo;secretly in love&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;secretly enemies&rdquo;, it creates a push and pull to their dynamic, which doesn&rsquo;t allow it to settle into a stable sibling-like dynamic that they want to settle into, despite never having it. It creates the feeling of the trope of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey\" target=\"_blank\">Will They or Won&rsquo;t They?</a>&rdquo; where even their arguments feel like <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension\" target=\"_blank\">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> or <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeAnOldMarriedCouple\" target=\"_blank\">Like An Old Married Couple</a> because of the way they are shot.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sansa and Jon proceed to get into a very <b>old-married-couple fight.</b>&rdquo; - Rachel Handler, <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2895137/game-of-thrones-recap-inglorious-bastards/\" target=\"_blank\">MTV 6x09 review</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;With all their bickering, one almost wonders if [Jon and Sansa] are <b>a few episodes away from getting down together</b>.&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/game-of-thrones-season-7-premiere-recap\" target=\"_blank\">Bennett Madison, Vanity Fair episode 7x01 review</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;So Jon and Sansa&hellip;they&rsquo;re like cousins right? [&hellip;] I think they&rsquo;re going to end up together&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m just crazy but I&rsquo;m <b>feeling vibes </b>and that makes me feel better because <b>I felt like they were pushing that</b>&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://geeklyinc.com/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-1-dragonstone/\" target=\"_blank\">Cast of Thrones, Episode 7x01 Podcast</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I said this last episode.

It&rsquo;s more &ldquo;known&rdquo; to them to not connect with each other or trust each other (and definitely not be attracted to each other). So a lot of the fighting personal insecurities aside, is about wanting a sense of going back to what they know because the entire situation feels too strange. To understand the root of this tension between Jon and Sansa, one has to go back to the very first scene of them that we see on screen. Their reunion.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The characters had not seen each other for a number of years (six seasons) and so what we discussed was that it should seem almost dream like to them, and that there would be <b>some tentativeness to their actions</b>. It was about <b>stringing along the anticipation of the reunion as long as possible</b> to <b>create the feeling of longing</b> and so that the moment they hugged would feel earned and satisfying.&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/game-of-thrones-season-6-episode-3-4-director-ama-questions-answers-2941998\" target=\"_blank\">Sackheim, Reddit Q&amp;A</a></p></blockquote><p>Of the reunions so far, it was the most emotionally rewarding despite being the most distant growing up and despite the underlying conflict between them that comes up afterward. The &ldquo;almost dream-like&rdquo; effect that Sackheim talks about shows in their reunion more than others. As Jon and Sansa still upon seeing each other, and hold eyes only on each other as Jon slowly makes his way to her and stands in front of her, still staring, unable to believe she is there. As Bran has been subsumed under the Three Eyed Raven, he is emotionally absent and anyway, Sansa breaks her disbelief with Bran much faster than she did with Jon in episode 6x04. Later, Arya comes to Winterfell with expectations of seeing Jon, who she was closest to, and finds Sansa, who she had a strained relationship, instead. Arya is met with a bit of disappointment because she had expectations. Thus, it is a bit - if not completely - underwhelming because it&rsquo;s visible that it is underwhelming to Arya.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The idea that after all Jon and Sansa have been through as characters, they&rsquo;re finally able to <b>put a foot back on solid ground</b> in terms of family and with whom that runs deeper than any other bond. It was a big moment for them and for us to see it&rdquo; &ldquo;And to knowing where two of them are going to go with <b>their relationship that never really meant that much before but now means so much more</b> because at this point, they&rsquo;re all that they have.&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEgDDDMk6lI\" target=\"_blank\">D&amp;D, Inside the Episode</a></p></blockquote><p>Jon and Sansa, on the other hand, because of never being close and being the first of the pack to reunite, didn&rsquo;t have any such high expectations. After the journeys they went through, anything from each other felt like an oasis in a desert. They fall into a strange ease and comfort, a quiet solace with moments of banter, but they also resist it. Sackheim brings up two conflicting emotions that their reunion was meant to capture: joy and fear, where the fear is overpowering and holds them back. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The only note I gave them during the scene was, &ldquo;<b>Hold yourself back. As much as it&rsquo;s joyous to see each other, you&rsquo;re equally as scared.</b> You don&rsquo;t know what to expect.&rdquo; The operative word was fear.<b> Fear of the unknown. </b>In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Flive-feed%2Fgame-thrones-jon-snow-daenerys-895034&amp;t=ZWQ1NTVmM2FjYzM5NzU5OWEyY2VjNmU2Y2I3NDYxY2YzYjViN2ZhOCwwV0N6WjZTNw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aek0Dr1CXIaPxf-CrR5ZTPg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Flostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F176213521082%2Ftrust-each-other-part-1&amp;m=0\" target=\"_blank\">David Sackheim</a>, director of 6x04 on Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s reunion </p></blockquote><p>Sackheim&rsquo;s emphasis on that &ldquo;tentativeness&rdquo; and &ldquo;fear of the unknown&rdquo; in the scene is what builds tension in that scene before offering catharsis. While I do think that Jon and Arya&rsquo;s reunion may still capture that &ldquo;almost dream-like&rdquo; effect, because of their close relationship growing up, there would be no fear. Currently where the story left off, they are aware of each other&rsquo;s survival and hope to reunite at Winterfell so watching it happen might bring on the waterworks but so would it bring on pure unadulterated joy because they&rsquo;ve probably imagined this a number of times. There would be familiarity and complete unfaltering trust in Jon and Arya&rsquo;s dynamic. On the other hand, as glad as Jon and Sansa are to find one another, their mutual &ldquo;fear of the unknown&rdquo; prevents them from ever completely falling into a sibling dynamic, even when they try to build bridges. In a way because of its two conflicting feelings of joy and fear, it encompasses Faulkner&rsquo;s &ldquo;conflict in the human heart&rdquo;, that Martin is inspired by. This fear isn&rsquo;t simply because of Cat&rsquo;s influence on Sansa growing up, but also because of what is happening between them as they feel like almost strangers getting to know one another. </p><p>What really grips me about Sackheim&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;Fear of the unknown&rdquo; on a psychological level for these two characters is that it reminds me the the concept of <i>Unheimlich</i> that Freud talks about in his essay &ldquo;The Uncanny&rdquo;. I know this might start appearing a bit too wordy, but bear with me. This is only a minute section in a larger series of posts. Just to clarify I don&rsquo;t think the creators in question actually read the essay, but I think it does offer some insight within the field of aesthetics, that most people seem to innately understand without reflecting on the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. The themes of familiarity and unfamiliarity are a part of a huge body of literature, whether in a social, political or psychological sense. </p><p>As a disclaimer, I think Freud&rsquo;s theories are heavily criticisable, especially on a scientific level and this is perhaps, one of the only essays that I think has worth because it&rsquo;s more literary and taps into themes explored in fiction.

Many interpret this as &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; or <i>unheimlich</i>&nbsp;to mean fear of the unfamiliar. That is how I felt Sackheim&rsquo;s quote connects. Of course, it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated than that because Jon and Sansa aren&rsquo;t exactly strangers because they grew up in the same vicinity in Winterfell, but they were hardly involved in each other&rsquo;s lives. They were part of an extended group of Starks but on the two polar opposite sides of the spectrum. Incidentally, Freud argues that the definition of the &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; or <i>unheimlic</i>h is not so concrete. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In general we are reminded that the word &lsquo;<i>heimlich</i>&rsquo; is not unambiguous, but belongs to two sets of ideas, which, without being contradictory, are yet very different: on the one hand it means what is familiar and agreeable, and on the other, what is concealed and kept out of sight. &lsquo;<i>Unheimlich</i>&rsquo; is customarily used, we are told, as the contrary only of the first signification of &lsquo;<i>heimlich</i>&rsquo;, and not of the second.

There is teasing banter and shows of affection, but there is also a hesitation and holding back in these moments apart from those that involve arguments.&nbsp;</p><p>This continues with Jon&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">odd reactions</a> to Sansa&rsquo;s &ldquo;suitors&rdquo; mentioning her, the goodbye scene at Dragonstone where Jorah looks back at Dany while Jon doesn&rsquo;t, their confusing titles as Jon is KITN but not Lord of Winterfell as Sansa is Lady (and acting Lord) of Winterfell because of her claim, the use of the Lord&rsquo;s chambers as a narrative device, and people questioning the nature of Sansa&rsquo;s feelings towards Jon assuming her hesitation to be about power rather than something else. Somehow, because of the other dynamics coming into the fold while Jon and Sansa are distanced, their moments of connection are spelt out even more. Jon and Sansa argued and kept things from each other, but ultimately they still had conversations where they cleared the air and also let down their guard a little. They allowed themselves a few moments of vulnerability and offering each other validation despite their disagreements. This did not happen with Sansa and Arya, who had more of a relationship growing up than Jon and Sansa. &nbsp;</p><p>A number of people&rsquo;s reactions come with the descriptors&nbsp;&ldquo;strange&rdquo; and &ldquo;weird&rdquo; and a hesitation to completely believe.&nbsp;The fact that it comes off strange may be deliberate as the characters never really act on anything or acknowledge this romantic tension and the audience is left hanging. It leaves one with a feeling of unease because one doesn&rsquo;t know what to expect and if it is truly happening. It&rsquo;s kind of a continuation of Sackheim&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>stringing along the anticipation [&hellip;] as long as possible to create a feeling of longing</i>&rdquo; which is built around that tentativeness of their actions. Even when it is pushed to the background. Four directors after Sackheim carry on this tension, where they share scenes (and more if you count related scenes). There is a &ldquo;je ne sais quoi&rdquo;, an indefinable, intrinsic feeling to it all. The trained viewer, who has consumed a lot of visual-audio content, can see it - even if they don&rsquo;t want to - because of internalising the language of film. Even the argument about it as having no basis in books is very contestable.&nbsp;</p><p>The result is that as much as the characters do not know what to expect, the audience doesn&rsquo;t either. So, it is easier to fall into the alternative explanation that the narrative acknowledges in the text even when it doesn&rsquo;t answer everything about the subtext. Certain actions may be dismissed as a coincidence, but it starts feeling more strange when the occurences keep building and even make narrative (and political) sense. Therefore, not only are the characters made to undergo this &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; experience so is the audience made to, even when they know the truth about Jon&rsquo;s parentage and how it could change everything that one assumed about the story before. It crosses the boundary of shipping this dynamic to become about people deep down needing to know if they were right about what the show was telling them via framing. It&rsquo;s the same kind of relief that people who thought episode 6x10 undoubtedly framed them romantically felt after Jon&rsquo;s parentage reveal later in the episode.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot know the ending of the story, of course, but I&rsquo;ve said multiple times that season 7 didn&rsquo;t end possibilities. Rather made it more of an inevitable political requirement should he survive. Politics, as loosely as D&amp;D follow it, is at the crux of the story. Everything stands because of the end goal is headed. As much as I&rsquo;d like to go into scene break-downs already, because Jon and Dany have occurred in the story, it is difficult to avoid discussing their very own framing. In the next post, I will talk about the visual juxtaposition of Jon/Dany and Jon/Sansa within the same season as they share two directors for different episodes. </p><p>(to be continued&hellip;)</p><p><a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176408436332/trust-each-other-part-3\" target=\"_blank\">Part 3</a></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>As I brought up in my previous post, &nbsp;a lot of the time when people talk about Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s dynamic on the show, they don&rsquo;t really reflect on why that &ldquo;tension&rdquo; exists as much or what it&rsquo;s really about. The characters keep shifting between arguing and bickering to letting down their guard for a bit and being vulnerable around each other. But there&rsquo;s always something left unsaid. Something that isn&rsquo;t acknowledged. This unlabelled &ldquo;something&rdquo; is a number of issues related to their individual journeys, the perception of them, but also, as I noted in <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176213521082/trust-each-other-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>, it comes down to romantic framing of that tension as well using cinematic devices that goes far beyond actors&rsquo; chemistry.<br /></p>\n<p>The way this dynamic is framed narratively, the personal is political and the political is personal. The &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; that doesn&rsquo;t exist in Jon and Arya&rsquo;s dynamic exists in Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a very confusing dynamic to a person who wants to establish them as &ldquo;complete enemies&rdquo; or just &ldquo;sibling rivalry&rdquo; (as they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re cousins) because they never completely settle into that. Their biggest theme being &lsquo;trust each other&rsquo;, not because they do completely, but because they want to and struggle to be able to. In a way, it all comes back to the 7x01 script note &ldquo;<i>They skirt around the true tension between them; all is subtext.</i>&rdquo; </p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the late second act complication that gives way to ~~~love~~~~~.( I am amused by how the show seems to vacillate wildly between [Jon and Sansa] being secretly in love and secretly enemies.)&rdquo; - Todd VanDerWerff in his responses to a comment on his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/26/12036976/game-of-thrones-finale-recap-winds-of-winter-cersei-wildfire-frey\" target=\"_blank\">6x10 review</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Although I had said last time that I will be getting into discussing the characters&rsquo; individual after providing the context of cinematic framing, I will be stalling that for another post it seems. This post elaborates on the way Jon and Sansa are shot creates both visual romantic tension, but also narrative tension, and how that plays a role in storytelling.</p>\n<h2><b>The Tension between the Familiar and the Unfamiliar&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<p>As you see from Todd VanDerWerff&rsquo;s quote above, he describes them with two polar opposites, secretly in love and secretly enemies, that it oscillates &ldquo;wildly&rdquo; between. It&rsquo;s a tension of opposites. &ldquo;Tuesdays with Morrie&rdquo; seems relevant to quote here.&nbsp;As I go through this series while delving into more character motivations in scenes, this quote will become more relevant to explain why Jon and Sansa react the way they do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tension of opposites: Life is a series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn&rsquo;t. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted. A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.&rdquo; - Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom<br /></p></blockquote>\n</p>",
