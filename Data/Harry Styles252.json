And I don\u2019t mean in the physical sense. (Even though are beautiful in that sense too) I mean you have one of the kindest hearts ever. You care about everyone you meet, no matter their circumstances. You believe in the good and want to change the world. I\u2019m amazed by you every day. Some stars only believe in kindness if it benefits them, if it\u2019s good publicity. But that\u2019s never mattered to you, I know it\u2019s never mattered to you. You genuinely just want the best for people. I love that about you.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Love, Y/N.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You jump at Sarah\u2019s voice, you turn and she\u2019s staring at you inquisitively.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You shove the letter into your suitcase before standing up to look at her.\u00a0\u201cJust putting something away.\u201d</p><p>She nods, unconvinced,\u00a0\u201cYou know usually envelopes go in mailboxes, so they can be mailed.\u201d You laugh nervously and walk towards the lounge area on the bus.\u00a0\u201cWhat is it? You can tell me, I\u2019m good with secrets.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You look around, to make sure there was no one but Sarah around, before sighing.\u00a0\u201cI write love letters.\u201d You look down at your feet, a little embarrassed,\u00a0\u201cTo Harry. I write letters to him.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Sarah stares,\u00a0\u201cLike, how they communicated in the nineteenth century?\u201d You nod and she bursts out laughing. Heat rushes to your face,\u00a0\u201cStop! It\u2019s not funny.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She straightens her face out and nods,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s very sweet. Harry will love that, he\u2019s an old soul.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never getting them\u201d You shake your head,\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re more like a diary, nobody is ever supposed to read them.

I promise he feels the same way.\u201d At your silence she sighs,\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t give him letters.

That\u2019s very corny, but I think you would like it. You love corny jokes. I told Sarah about my letters. She thinks you would love them, but I\u2019m not so sure. They\u2019re not real letters, more like small entries whenever I really feel like I need to get my feelings out. It felt good to tell her though, it\u2019s nice not having this a huge secret. I wish I could tell you, but I\u2019m afraid that would make things awkward between is. I don\u2019t know if I could handle things being awkward between us. It might just kill me&hellip;</i></p><p><i>Love, Y/N.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI love the smell of chocolate, don\u2019t you?\u201d You\u2019re sitting in one the seats as Harry jogs in front of you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can smell it from here?\u201d He stops in front of before spinning around like it would help him,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You laugh,\u00a0\u201cNo, you dork. I just know some parts of the park smells like chocolate. And the store outside the park.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes,\u00a0\u201cLast time I was here was with the boys. A few of us dressed up in the costumes. It was hilarious.\u201d He shakes his head with a soft smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou miss them?\u201d He comes to sit next to you, taking a sip from his water bottle.\u00a0\u201cYeah, it\u2019s weird touring without them. I did it for so long it became second nature, you know?\u201d You nod and wipe a little sweat off Harry\u2019s forehead with the his little towel.\u00a0</p><p>He smiles in thanks, \u201cI love the band though. They\u2019re amazing, and having you is the best.\u201d He shrugs, looking down at his feet.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m grateful for being able to tour on my own and have my own career, I just miss them sometimes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMissing them doesn\u2019t make you ungrateful. It makes you human.\u201d You smile softly,\u00a0\u201cThey were like your brothers, I would be worried if you didn\u2019t miss them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you how much I adore you?\u201d He asks and you laugh,\u00a0\u201cNot nearly enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore you.\u201d</p><p><b><i>June 22nd, 2018 - New York. New York.</i></b></p><p><i>Harry Styles, You have sold out arguably the most popular concert venue. Not one show, but two shows. I am so incredibly proud of you. You deserve all this and more. I hope you know that.</i></p><p><i>Love, Y/N.</i></p><p>New York is beautiful. Loud and busy, but beautiful. And it was one the shows that had time in between the next, so you all got to stay in a hotel and enjoy the city.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve said no when you asked for conjoined rooms.\u201d You mumble as Harry flops onto your bed.\u00a0\u201cI thought the door would be bolted shut and you wouldn\u2019t be able to actually get in whenever.\u00a0I feel dumb.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Harry lays a hand on your ankle,\u00a0\u201cI miss you.\u201d He mumbles into the mattress, his hand rubbing up and down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d You say quietly, afraid a loud voice would ruin the moment. Harry looks up at you and frowns,\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited you out here so we could spend time together, but I feel like I\u2019m always busy. The last time we actually hung out was In Pennsylvania. I feel bad, I miss you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You smile gently,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay that we don\u2019t hang out all the time. I know you\u2019re busy. I\u2019m just glad to be here and to get to watch you perform almost every night.\u201d You kick him softly so he climbs up the mattress. He rests his head on your stomach and you run a hand through his hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, you know that, right?\u201d He asks quietly, one of his hands intertwining with the one you didn\u2019t have in his hair. You nod,\u00a0\u201ci know. You\u2019re my best friend too.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Hearing him call you a friend didn\u2019t hurt nearly as much as some people make it out to be. You knew he considered you a friend, that was just a constant ache that was there. But in this moment you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to be hurt, this moment was perfect.\u00a0</p><p>You were content to be like this forever. Even if it was just as friends.\u00a0</p><p><i><b>July 1st, 2018 - Chicago, Illinois.\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i>Harry Styles, I love you. I love you. I love you.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Love, Y/N.</i></p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d Harry asks from your hotel room floor. It was another week until the next show so Harry and the crew had decided you would take a much needed break in Chicago to recuperate. Some people went home, others were in rooms down the hall. </p><p>\u201cYou will anyways.\u201d You mumble. When you look up Harry is looking at you nervously and Harry rarely gets nervous. You shut your laptop and sit up straight, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like me?\u201d He asks quickly and quietly. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI found a letter and it had my name on the envelope so-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d You cut Harry off, you feel mortified. How had this happened?</p><p>\u201cAnd I read it and Y/N, do you like me?\u201d He looks up at you, but you look away, unable to make eye contact with him.\u00a0\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d You ask quietly.\u00a0</p><p>You had always been careful. They all stayed in your suitcase and when you got home they were gonna go into a box under your bed. Never to be opened by anybody except you. \u201cIt was on the bus. I just, I assumed it was from a fan or something.\u00a0I\u2019m sorry. I lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d You cut him off, you weren\u2019t sure if you could handle a rejection. Would you have to go home early? Would Harry insist things not get awkward and you stay? Which would be worse?\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N, if you would just listen-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to- I can\u2019t.\u201d You scramble out of you bed and Harry follows, standing up from the floor. You bolt from the room and down the hall, you knew this hotel had a bar, maybe you could hang out there for awhile. You had to figure out how to explain you writing him love letters.</p><hr><p>You were only gone for a couple hours, but when you got back to your room Harry was gone and there was an envelope on your bed.\u00a0You recognized Harry\u2019s handwriting immediately.\u00a0</p><p><i>Y/N,\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I love you. I\u2019ve loved you from the moment I laid eyes on you. I love everything about you. Your kind heart. Your beautiful eyes. How caring and gentle you are. I couldn\u2019t live without you.

I\u2019m pretty sure I will always love you.</i></p><p><i>Yours, Harry.\u00a0</i></p><p>Your hands are shaking as you finish the letter, and before you can even think you\u2019re out of the room and knocking on Harry\u2019s door.\u00a0\u201cPlease be here. Please. Please. Please.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He opens it,\u00a0\u201cY/N-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019ve loved since we met at that party and you asked me where I got my nail polish. I love you.\u201d You rush out,\u00a0\u201cStill love me too?\u201d<br/></p><p>He leans down,\u00a0\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d You nod and he places a hand on your cheek before pressing his lips against yours. You wrap your arms around his neck and \u00a0he begins to pull you into his room.\u00a0</p><p>You kick the door shut and his letter falls from your hand, landing on the floor. He wraps both arms around your waist as he pulls you towards his bed. You two finally break apart when he falls back on the mattress.\u00a0</p><p>You take a deep breath as he trails kisses down your neck,\u00a0\u201cSo&hellip;\u201d he mumbles against your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo&hellip; what?\u201d You whisper as he leans back to look at you.\u00a0\u201cWhen do I get to read the rest of my letters?\u201d He smirks and you push him back so he falls back.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not funny.\u201d<br/></p><hr><p><i>I\u2019m so sad I lost the original version of this&hellip; I\u2019m still proud of it, but this isn\u2019t the same :( anyways, I hope you enjoyed!!\u00a0</i></p>",

I hope you know that.</i></p><p><i>Love, Y/N.</i></p><p>New York is beautiful. Loud and busy, but beautiful.

Some people went home, others were in rooms down the hall. </p><p>\u201cYou will anyways.\u201d You mumble. When you look up Harry is looking at you nervously and Harry rarely gets nervous.

I lo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d You cut him off, you weren\u2019t sure if you could handle a rejection. Would you have to go home early?

You wrap your arms around his neck and \u00a0he begins to pull you into his room.\u00a0</p><p>You kick the door shut and his letter falls from your hand, landing on the floor. He wraps both arms around your waist as he pulls you towards his bed. You two finally break apart when he falls back on the mattress.\u00a0</p><p>You take a deep breath as he trails kisses down your neck,\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026\u201d he mumbles against your shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 what?\u201d You whisper as he leans back to look at you.\u00a0\u201cWhen do I get to read the rest of my letters?\u201d He smirks and you push him back so he falls back.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not funny.\u201d<br></p><hr><p><i>I\u2019m so sad I lost the original version of this\u2026 I\u2019m still proud of it, but this isn\u2019t the same :( anyways, I hope you enjoyed!!\u00a0</i></p>",

You care about everyone you meet, no matter their circumstances. You believe in the good and want to change the world. I&rsquo;m amazed by you every day. Some stars only believe in kindness if it benefits them, if it&rsquo;s good publicity. But that&rsquo;s never mattered to you, I know it&rsquo;s never mattered to you.

That&rsquo;s very corny, but I think you would like it. You love corny jokes. I told Sarah about my letters. She thinks you would love them, but I&rsquo;m not so sure. They&rsquo;re not real letters, more like small entries whenever I really feel like I need to get my feelings out. It felt good to tell her though, it&rsquo;s nice not having this a huge secret.
