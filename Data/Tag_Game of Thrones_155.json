I think the third time is most likely to be by dragonfire.</p><h2><b>Pre-Conquest history</b></h2><p>Before Aegon arrived, Winterfell was attacked by the Boltons, who burned it as part of a long-standing rivalry:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe enmity between the Starks and Boltons went back to the Long Night itself, it is claimed. The wars between these two ancient families were legion, and not all ended in victory for House Stark. <b>King Royce Bolton</b>, Second of His Name, <b>is said to have taken and burned Winterfell itself</b>; his namesake and descendant Royce IV&hellip; <b>did the same three centuries later.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoiAF</p></blockquote><p>Royce Bolton and his descendant attacked Winterfell twice. This means that Ramsay burning Winterfell falls on the <i>third time</i> for House Bolton.</p><p>Another event involved a natural disaster. We learn from Bran that the tower he likes to climb was struck by lightning in the distant past:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHis favorite haunt was <b>the broken tower</b>. Once it had been a <b>watchtower</b>, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, <b>a lightning strike had set it afire</b>. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t count these events in the rule of 3 because it happened pre-canon (not in the actual narrative). However it might be the first clue that something important is going to happen again around this tower. If plots come full circle, we may return to it at the end of the story.</p><h2><b>Close to dragonfire: The North meets Aegon I</b></h2><p>Before I describe (what I think is) foreshadowing for Winterfell burning, I\u2019d like to discuss a time when Winterfell almost burned by dragon fire. It was an extremely close-call.</p><!-- more --><p>The history of Torrhen kneeling to Aegon is oversimplified by the fandom at times. The prevailing view is that he was afraid of what Aegon would do, he knelt and spared his people, and everything was fine thereafter. However, Torrhen had assembled 30K Northern warriors who were ready to kick Aegon out of Westeros. His brother Brandon Snow offered to slay the dragons in their sleep. I doubt this bellicose sentiment evaporated with the bend of a knee. And in fact the World of Ice and Fire indicates there was discontent among the Northerners. Some denied allegiance to the Conqueror. A notable example is the Company of the Rose. Formed by \u201cwild men\u201d and women from the North, the Company of the Rose refused to bend the knee and instead chose exile across the narrow sea. They formed a sellsword company in Essos. The Company of the Rose is interesting because of rose symbolism and its links to Stark women.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"639\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99a9a8168c3d31101f91c5e25cfa23af/tumblr_inline_pjtdpfx6ZT1run9xa_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"639\"/></figure><p><i>\u201cThe King Who Knelt\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/chasestone/art/The-King-Who-Knelt-497558606\" target=\"_blank\">Chase Stone</a><br/></i></p><p>Torrhen\u2019s decision was also unwelcomed by own family:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTorrhen\u2019s sons were less glad of the Targaryen yoke, and some among them entertained talk of <b>rebelling</b>, and of raising the Stark banner whether Lord Torrhen consented or not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>The text also brings up a Stark marriage arranged by Rhaenys:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whether anti-Targaryen feelings were made worse by Queen Rhaenys Targaryen\u2019s efforts to knit together the new, single realm with marriages between the great houses is left to the reader to consider. That Torrhen Stark\u2019s daughter was wed to the young and ill-fated Lord of the Vale is well-known; it was one of the many peace-binding marriages forged by Rhaenys.</p><p>But there are letters preserved at the Citadel <b>suggesting that Stark accepted these arrangements only after much protest, and that the bride\u2019s brothers refused to attend the wedding entirely</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>Refusing to attend the wedding is a sign that something was awry in the Targaryen/Stark relationship. The North gained little from this marriage and the Stark daughter was used to help the Targaryens secure the Vale. The Stark/Arryn marriage was also a disaster that did not bring peace. Ronnel Arryn, a child-lord, sounds exactly like Sweetrobin in his obsession with the moon door and flying. Ronnel was usurped by his brother Jonos, who declared himself the rightful lord and King of the Vale. Maegor flew to the Eyrie to crush the rebellion and Janos was betrayed by his own garrison (similar to Theon).</p><p>This bit of history seems important because it\u2019s the first instance of a daughter of Lord Stark in the Vale and has similarities to what the Lannisters did with Sansa. Torrhen\u2019s daughter was used as a pawn and her family was coerced into making this match. This backstory lends support to the theory that Dany will attempt her own marriage arrangements in Westeros, perhaps trying to use Sansa as a pawn.</p><p>To sum up, it is important to note that the North did resist the Targaryens the first time; they just did it in a subtle way. In light of this \u201chidden\u201d contempt, I don\u2019t believe the Northerners will be willing to accept another Torrhen-like decision the second time around, especially not after Robert\u2019s Rebellion, Robb\u2019s Rebellion, Bolton takeover, and a second rebellion against the crown by Jon and Sansa. The conditions Dany will face will be different than during Torrhen\u2019s time; plus, Torrhen did not have a hidden Targaryen heir in his pocket to challenge Aegon.</p><p>Now I want to talk about events related to Winterfell burning in the present setting.</p><h2><b>The first burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>Winterfell\u2019s library (also in a tower) is the first to be burned in the text. The wolves and dogs go berserk:</p><blockquote><p><b>The wolves were still howling</b>&hellip;\u201cDogs,\u201d he said, listening. \u201c<b>All the dogs are barking. They\u2019ve never done that before &hellip;</b> \u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cFire,\u201d he whispered&hellip;\u201c<b>The library tower\u2019s on fire</b>,\u201d he said&hellip;Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and <b>thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries.</b> Then she closed the shutters.</p><p>- Catelyn, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The loss of these books, and knowledge, is extremely sad. It feels like the first instance of Winterfell being torn apart, piece by piece. \u00a0</p><h2><b>The second burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>This time Winterfell is not only burned, the entire household is killed, much like Ned\u2019s household in King\u2019s Landing:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWinterfell.\u201d His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth. <i>One day when I come back I won\u2019t know how to talk anymore.</i> \u201c<b>It was Winterfell. It was all on fire. There were horse smells, and steel, and blood.</b> They killed everyone, Meera.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>( note the foreshadowing of Bran Bot here, with him not knowing how to talk ;_;)</p><p>And Summer relays how dangerous fire is to the reader:</p><blockquote><p><i>Men, many men, many horses, and <b>fire, fire, fire</b></i>. <b>No smell was more dangerous, </b>not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin.\u00a0</p><p>- Summer (Bran) ACOK</p></blockquote><p>The culprit isn\u2019t exactly Theon. It\u2019s Ramsay Bolton who infiltrates Winterfell and pretends to be a servant helping Theon in his mission:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnother man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. \u201cSave me the Freys,\u201d the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, \u201cand <b>burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>\u201cBurn it all\u201d sounds like a familiar refrain for a certain member of House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>Imagery suggesting Winterfell could burn a third time:</b></h2><p>Note: A few of these passages I list will explore evidence for Winterfell burning through dreams, prophecies, and omens. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are \u201cevidence,\u201d but I hope that with enough mention of them, they will start to culminate into coherent foreshadowing.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"376\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a9eedf22e1943379bc08fa02af05a3b/tumblr_inline_pjteftXGn91run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"376\"/></figure><p><b>1. Summer\u2019s vision.</b> In Bran\u2019s wolf dream as Summer, he sees a curious vision that has been the subject of a lot of speculation over the years:</p><blockquote><p>The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky <b>he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame</b>. He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This was seen during Ramsay\u2019s burning of Winterfell. Now, I know that Summer uses &quot;wolf&rdquo; speak, for instance &ldquo;man-claws&rdquo; are swords and &ldquo;hardskin&rdquo; is armor. So this image of a snake could be fire arrows or some type of catapult. Hence, this piece of evidence, by itself, is weak. However, to bring it back to dragons (which are a symbol of fire and blood according to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2267&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114809000\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a>), Bran relates the second burning of Winterfell to House Targaryen:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA wolf dream,\u201d said Bran. \u201cI smelled it too. Nothing smells like <b>fire, or blood</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>2. The Dothraki.</b> This second type of imagery also references conquerors. This exchange occurs right before Ramsay burns the castle:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe crows came in the blue dust, with the evening stars. \u201c<b>The Dothraki </b>believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead,\u201d Theon said. Maester Luwin had told him that, a long time ago.<br/><b>\u201cDothraki?\u201d</b><br/><b>\u201cThe horselords across the narrow sea.\u201d<br/></b>\u201cOh. Them.\u201d Black Lorren frowned through his beard. \u201cSavages believe all manner of foolish things.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s a completely random line thrown in about the Dothraki. It comes out of nowhere at a significant time. Theon brings up the \u201chorselords from across the narrow sea\u201d a few lines before Ramsay torches the place. Moreover, Black Lorren dismisses the Dothraki as foolish savages, just like Black Harren dismissed Aegon\u2019s ability to melt his castle. This may be a foreshadowing a future event where the Dothraki come to Winterfell and kill the people there, like Ramsay did.</p><p><b>3. Fiery stallions.</b> The Stallion Who Mounts the World is a prophecy of the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAs swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the <b>milk men in the stone tents</b> will fear his name. The prince is riding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe stallion who mounts the world <b>will burn no cities now</b>. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Mirri Maz Duur (Daenerys, AGOT).</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"223\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02a2e45b2d52a6d4a088601a5228ed9a/tumblr_inline_pjtdw1HoJz1run9xa_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"223\"/></figure><p>The Stallion is supposed to be the most powerful khal ever seen. Mirri is likely mistaken on this prophecy: it probably didn\u2019t not die with Rhaego, but lived on through Dany. The reason I bring up the prophecy as evidence for Winterfell burning a third time is because this passage occurs during the second burning of Winterfell:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnother man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. \u201cSave me the Freys,\u201d the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, \u201cand burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.\u201d<br/>The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was <b>Smiler, kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze, screaming, rearing &hellip;</b> \u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Smiler is a stallion - which should remind us of another stallion in the story:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cPerhaps one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his <b>fiery stallion</b> in the night lands and smiling down on me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And this one:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood <b>beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Again, the imagery of Dothraki and the stallion linked to Winterfell\u2019s 2nd burning is really curious. I get the feeling that this is foreshadowing something really important.</p><p><b>4. Burning heart trees.</b> After Theon\u2019s conquest of Winterfell, Stannis attempts to claim the North under the Baratheon/R\u2019hllor banner. He seeks a big victory to draw forces to his cause. He first attempts to do this by legitimizing Jon. However, Jon fears that this would mean turning the castle over to the red god, aka, the flames:</p><blockquote><p>The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said &hellip; but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots, and <b>feed it to the red woman&rsquo;s hungry fire god</b>. <i>I have no right. Winterfell belongs to the old gods.</i>\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Much like Winterfell\u2019s library burning, the loss of knowledge and the loss of something sacred might occur - the burning of the heart trees. The trees are like the religious temples for the Northerners. It\u2019s why Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s burning of the Sept and Dothraki sacred city, respectively, is hailed as a parallel dark event. It appears that, through the burning of religious sites, the author continues to remind the reader what is at stake and what could happen in the future. Moreover, burning food/nature/trees is also connected to &ldquo;Dragons plant no trees,&rdquo; and the possibility that the heart tree might be destroyed by another set of \u00a0invaders from across the narrow sea&ndash;the Dothraki&ndash;like the Andals and the First Men before them.</p><p><b>5. Stark dreams.</b> The chapter after Ramsay burns Winterfell, Jon dreams of burning castles.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSleep came at last, and with it nightmares. He dreamed of <b>burning castles</b> and <b>dead men rising unquiet from their graves</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This dream could simply relate to Winterfell burning as it\u2019s happening in <i>Clash</i>, but we shouldn\u2019t dismiss the possibility of it being a future event. Since Dany\u2019s House of the Undying prophecy features past, present, and future events, we have to wonder if Jon is dreaming about Winterfell burning the 2nd time, the 3rd time, or both? The dead men rising could be Bran and Rickon rising from the crypts. But survivors could also hide in the crypts during the 3rd time as well.</p><p>Furthermore, in <i>Storm</i>, Arya encounters the brotherhood, led by R\u2019hllor, and has a bad dream that again suggests that Winterfell is burning:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cShe dreamt of home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. <b>It was not a good dream, </b>though. She was alone outside the castle, up to her knees in mud. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and the castle faded before her, <b>until it looked more like smoke than granite.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Arya, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Dreams are never clear-cut in terms of their relationship to time. So Winterfell going up in smoke sounds like a metaphor for an event that has already happened and one that could happen in the future.</p><p>To illustrate this further, toward the end of <i>Clash</i>, Theon also has a very Ebenezer Scrooge-like dream that he is dining with the dead from the past, present, and future. He sees the past: Ned, Robert, Ned\u2019s household guard, and all the men Theon killed at Winterfell. He sees a future event: Robb walking in (foreshadowing his death). He also sees the ghosts of the distant past: Brandon, Lyanna, and Rickard. The more vague imagery is reserved for the reader to guess: <i>\u201cAlong the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife.\u201d </i>Are they past, present, or future dead?</p><p>This past/present/future device reminds me that we might need to take a second look at the prophecy from the Ghost at High Heart:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, <b>drums</b> and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the <b>little bells</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Ghost of High Heart (Arya, ASOS)</p></blockquote><p>During the Red Wedding the bells on Jinglebell\u2019s hat are mentioned: <i>\u201cHis little bells were ringing, ringing, ringing, and the drum went boom doom boom.</i>\u201d So the prophecy could be fulfilled at that point. However, like Theon\u2019s dream, it could refer to past, present, and future. Maybe Battle of the Bells during Robert\u2019s Rebellion is the past, the Red Wedding the present, and the Dothraki the future (they wear tiny bells in their hair to symbolize their victories)? Jon also hears drums (\u201cdoom doom doom\u201d) above the crypts of Winterfell in one of his own dreams&ndash;which is foreboding. In addition, this prophecy may be relevant for a future event; especially since Dany sees the Red Wedding in her own prophecy&ndash;a fact that has <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://rose-of-red-lake.tumblr.com/post/180047158803/why-does-dany-see-the-red-wedding&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114821000\" target=\"_blank\">puzzled me</a> for years.</p><p><b>6. Burning castles and melting stone.</b> There are numerous references to burning stone/granite and burning/melting towers in the text.</p><p>In Theon\u2019s chapter, a point about granite not yielding easily to fire is mentioned as he returns to Winterfell after the 2nd burning:</p><blockquote><p>This place was scarred and broken, more ruin than redoubt, a haunt of crows and corpses. The great double curtain wall still stood, <b>for granite does not yield easily to fire</b>, but most of the towers and keeps within were roofless. A few had collapsed.\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, Stannis mentions to Jon how granite doesn\u2019t burn easily, while in the same breath emphasizing that the people matter more than the castle:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWinterfell is no more. Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch.\u201d<br/>\u201c<b>Granite does not burn easily,</b>\u201d Stannis said. \u201cThe castle can be rebuilt, in time. <b>It\u2019s not the walls that make a lord, it\u2019s the man.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Which also echoes Ned\u2019s words to Jon:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo wall can keep you safe,\u201d his father had told him once, as they walked the walls of <b>Winterfell</b>. \u201c<b>A wall is only as strong as the men who defend it</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Emphasizing the importance of people - rather than walls - and also mentioning burning granite (even if it is difficult) seems significant. I\u2019m getting the sense that the Starks may lose their home but they\u2019ll be stronger for it. Home isn\u2019t necessarily a castle&ndash;it\u2019s the people you want to be around.</p><p>Despite the mention of granite being difficult to melt, stone does melt eventually when dragons are involved. Harrenhal is important because of its prominence in the main story of ASOIAF. The burning of Harrenhal by Aegon is described this way:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[T]he towers of Harrenhal glowed red against the night, like f<b>ive great candles</b> \u2026 and like candles, they began to twist and melt, as <b>runnels of molten stone ran down their sides</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>And Northerners had eyes on the aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTorrhen\u2019s scouts had seen the ruins of Harrenhal, where <b>slow red fires still burned beneath the rubble</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"460\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f910ac76f9976c8dabb4c82cd16692b/tumblr_inline_pjte0hh3b41run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"460\"/></figure><p><i>\u201cHarrenhal, on the north shore of the Gods Eye\u201d\u00a0by Lino Drieghe<br/></i></p><p>The author wants to impart on the reader that even stone can melt; this detail may prove important later with Winterfell. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> also <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176121343152/look-at-it-nowa-blasted-ruin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114826000\" target=\"_blank\">discusses</a> how, even though the burning of Harrenhal was a game changer for warfare, Dany will most likely continue that game.</p><p>The Broken Tower at Winterfell is also known as the \u201cBurned Tower.\u201d It could also be foreshadowing for another storm/attack by fire, this time from dragons. Lighting also strikes the tower at Queenscrown as Jon is betraying Ygritte, while the Stark heir (Bran) uses it to stay hidden/protected. Jon also has a \u201cburned tower\u201d of his own. The Night\u2019s Watch recruits joke that Jon was the first recruit to burn down the Lord Commander\u2019s tower and get rewarded for it. Perhaps this is foreshadowing Jon fighting Dany with fire and causing destruction in his wake, but being \u201crewarded\u201d by being chosen as king.</p><p><b>7. Weddings and conquering.</b> Marriage as a key to winning nettlesome territory (Dorne, Crackclaw Point) is a reoccuring theme in the books. Dany encounters this dilemma in Meereen, when she has to decide between a wedding or perpetual war. It took 184 years for the Targaryens to set aside their blood purity and intermarry with the Dornish. Similarly, through Torrhen, the North was conquered under threat of dragonfire. The Targaryens dictated what would happen to Torrhen\u2019s family and arranged a marriage for his daughter to bind the North to the Vale.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe Targaryens also brokered many marriages between noble houses from the far ends of the realm, in hopes that such alliances would help tie the conquered lands together and make the seven kingdoms one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>Either with or without dragons, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/149750-why-is-the-north-talked-about-as-if-its-impossible-to-invade/%26do%3DfindComment%26comment%3D8092216&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114827000\" target=\"_blank\">North would be very difficult to conquer</a>. This is why marriage to the heir to Winterfell is important: it solidifies a family\u2019s hold on the North. Theon thought about this route during his invasion:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>His father thought only in terms of conquest, but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it?</b> Force and fear could carry you only so far. A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south; elsewise <b>Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them.</b> <b>Sansa</b> was a pretty little thing too, and by now likely even ripe for bedding. But she was a thousand leagues away, in the clutches of the Lannisters. A shame.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Marrying Tyrion to Sansa and Ramsay to fake Arya was another way these Stark outsiders secured the North - but it&rsquo;s clear that they would also need to hold it through force and fear, like Theon.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175878105372/history-is-a-wheel-jons-rebellion&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114829000\" target=\"_blank\">speculates</a>, the fact that the Sansa/Tyrion marriage has yet to be consummated or annulled may come into play at a later date. The ambiguity here seems to be intentional. A Tyrion/Stark marriage would benefit Dany, with Tyrion as her advisor claiming both the Westerlands and the North through a Stark daughter in Winterfell.</p><p>If Dany attempts to arrange marriages like her ancestor Rhaenys, she would be walking into a minefield. The idea of Sansa marrying again against her will is abhorrent. Therefore, if Dany wants to conquer the North and its people are more resistant to her than they were under Torrhen (which is likely), she will have a difficult time of it without getting Sansa\u2019s buy-in. Sansa holds a lot of soft power here.</p><p>However it plays out, the Stark with the most influence over the Lords is the person who would need to be married to someone with ties to the conqueror if he/she wants to hold the North. This pits Dany\u2019s desires for taking back all 7 kingdoms with her talents for playing the political marriage game (emphasized in Robb\u2019s storyline). If done in a ham-fisted way, Dany (or Tyrion, as her proxy) arranging marriages would be so explosive that I can see it causing another Dance of Dragons (a wedding or a war).</p><p><b>8. Comets.</b> This connection of dragons to the comet was also explored in another <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114830000\" target=\"_blank\">meta</a> by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>. Keep in mind that the first mention of the comet in the text doesn\u2019t occur in <i>Clash</i>, but in <i>Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cJhogo spied it first. \u201cThere,\u201d he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. <b>The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\u2019s tail.</b> She could not have asked for a stronger sign.<br/>Dany took the torch from Aggo\u2019s hand and thrust it between the logs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The comet is an omen for dragons and is connected to Winterfell frequently in the text. Before Theon\u2019s invasion, the wolves were howling at the comet. Can wolves howling at the comet foreshadow dragons burning Winterfell? The subtext here is ominous:<br/></p><blockquote><p>Maester Luwin did not think so. \u201cWolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.\u201d</p><p>When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. \u201cYour wolves have more wit than your maester,\u201d the wildling woman said. \u201cThey know truths the grey man has forgotten.\u201d The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, \u201c<b>Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.\u201d</b></p><p>&hellip;Old Nan&hellip;lived longer than any of them. \u201c<b>Dragons</b>,\u201d she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. <b>\u201cIt be dragons, boy,\u201d </b>she insisted.\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Since two wise elders (Nan and Osha) who are most clue-ed in to the story&rsquo;s history see the comet as a symbol of blood/fire/dragons, I think the evidence becomes much stronger that we will see direwolves vs. dragons in the future.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The direwolves know something is wrong and are warning Winterfell of a threat. The imagery of howling dogs was also used to herald Dany\u2019s birth in the show.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1172\" data-orig-height=\"661\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2d4c939a1f06622fba73cae7a4b5b22/tumblr_inline_pjte3wmECA1run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1172\" data-orig-height=\"661\"/></figure><p>Aemon also believes that Daenerys is the savior in the prophecy Rhaegar was trying to piece together:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a <b>comet</b> had been seen above King\u2019s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and <b>Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet.</b> What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Samwell, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>I feel sorry for Aemon, because it might be important to ask if a bleeding star/comet is a good or a bad sign. No one seems to ask this! It\u2019s left up to the reader to pick up on the subtext here. Varys helps the foreshadowing move toward the negative, in this respect:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe have dire need of you on the council. Have you seen the comet?\u201d<br/>\u201cI\u2019m short, not blind,\u201d Tyrion said. Out on the kingsroad, <b>it had seemed to cover half the sky, outshining the crescent moon.</b><br/>\u201cIn the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,\u201d Varys said. \u201cThey say it comes as a herald before a king, <b>to warn of fire and blood to follow.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>- Tyrion, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>9. Spoilers for S8!</b> It does look like there is some kind of massive fire event going on at Winterfell based on filming reports and photos (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://watchersonthewall.com/major-new-game-of-thrones-season-8-spoilers-out-of-the-winterfell-set/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114834000\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).

It was an extremely close-call.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The history of Torrhen kneeling to Aegon is oversimplified by the fandom at times. The prevailing view is that he was afraid of what Aegon would do, he knelt and spared his people, and everything was fine thereafter. However, Torrhen had assembled 30K Northern warriors who were ready to kick Aegon out of Westeros. His brother Brandon Snow offered to slay the dragons in their sleep. I doubt this bellicose sentiment evaporated with the bend of a knee. And in fact the World of Ice and Fire indicates there was discontent among the Northerners. Some denied allegiance to the Conqueror. A notable example is the Company of the Rose. Formed by \u201cwild men\u201d and women from the North, the Company of the Rose refused to bend the knee and instead chose exile across the narrow sea. They formed a sellsword company in Essos. The Company of the Rose is interesting because of rose symbolism and its links to Stark women.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"639\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99a9a8168c3d31101f91c5e25cfa23af/tumblr_inline_pjtdpfx6ZT1run9xa_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"639\"></figure><p><i>\u201cThe King Who Knelt\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/chasestone/art/The-King-Who-Knelt-497558606\" target=\"_blank\">Chase Stone</a><br></i></p><p>Torrhen\u2019s decision was also unwelcomed by own family:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTorrhen\u2019s sons were less glad of the Targaryen yoke, and some among them entertained talk of <b>rebelling</b>, and of raising the Stark banner whether Lord Torrhen consented or not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>The text also brings up a Stark marriage arranged by Rhaenys:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhether anti-Targaryen feelings were made worse by Queen Rhaenys Targaryen\u2019s efforts to knit together the new, single realm with marriages between the great houses is left to the reader to consider. That Torrhen Stark\u2019s daughter was wed to the young and ill-fated Lord of the Vale is well-known; it was one of the many peace-binding marriages forged by Rhaenys.</p><p>But there are letters preserved at the Citadel <b>suggesting that Stark accepted these arrangements only after much protest, and that the bride\u2019s brothers refused to attend the wedding entirely</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>Refusing to attend the wedding is a sign that something was awry in the Targaryen/Stark relationship. The North gained little from this marriage and the Stark daughter was used to help the Targaryens secure the Vale. The Stark/Arryn marriage was also a disaster that did not bring peace. Ronnel Arryn, a child-lord, sounds exactly like Sweetrobin in his obsession with the moon door and flying. Ronnel was usurped by his brother Jonos, who declared himself the rightful lord and King of the Vale. Maegor flew to the Eyrie to crush the rebellion and Janos was betrayed by his own garrison (similar to Theon).</p><p>This bit of history seems important because it\u2019s the first instance of a daughter of Lord Stark in the Vale and has similarities to what the Lannisters did with Sansa. Torrhen\u2019s daughter was used as a pawn and her family was coerced into making this match. This backstory lends support to the theory that Dany will attempt her own marriage arrangements in Westeros, perhaps trying to use Sansa as a pawn.</p><p>To sum up, it is important to note that the North did resist the Targaryens the first time; they just did it in a subtle way. In light of this \u201chidden\u201d contempt, I don\u2019t believe the Northerners will be willing to accept another Torrhen-like decision the second time around, especially not after Robert\u2019s Rebellion, Robb\u2019s Rebellion, Bolton takeover, and a second rebellion against the crown by Jon and Sansa. The conditions Dany will face will be different than during Torrhen\u2019s time; plus, Torrhen did not have a hidden Targaryen heir in his pocket to challenge Aegon.</p><p>Now I want to talk about events related to Winterfell burning in the present setting.</p><h2><b>The first burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>Winterfell\u2019s library (also in a tower) is the first to be burned in the text. The wolves and dogs go berserk:</p><blockquote><p><b>The wolves were still howling</b>\u2026\u201cDogs,\u201d he said, listening. \u201c<b>All the dogs are barking. They\u2019ve never done that before \u2026</b> \u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cFire,\u201d he whispered\u2026\u201c<b>The library tower\u2019s on fire</b>,\u201d he said\u2026Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and <b>thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries.</b> Then she closed the shutters.</p><p>- Catelyn, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The loss of these books, and knowledge, is extremely sad. It feels like the first instance of Winterfell being torn apart, piece by piece. \u00a0</p><h2><b>The second burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>This time Winterfell is not only burned, the entire household is killed, much like Ned\u2019s household in King\u2019s Landing:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWinterfell.\u201d His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth. <i>One day when I come back I won\u2019t know how to talk anymore.</i> \u201c<b>It was Winterfell. It was all on fire. There were horse smells, and steel, and blood.</b> They killed everyone, Meera.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>( note the foreshadowing of Bran Bot here, with him not knowing how to talk ;_;)</p><p>And Summer relays how dangerous fire is to the reader:</p><blockquote><p><i>Men, many men, many horses, and <b>fire, fire, fire</b></i>. <b>No smell was more dangerous, </b>not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin.\u00a0</p><p>- Summer (Bran) ACOK</p></blockquote><p>The culprit isn\u2019t exactly Theon. It\u2019s Ramsay Bolton who infiltrates Winterfell and pretends to be a servant helping Theon in his mission:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnother man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. \u201cSave me the Freys,\u201d the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, \u201cand <b>burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>\u201cBurn it all\u201d sounds like a familiar refrain for a certain member of House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>Imagery suggesting Winterfell could burn a third time:</b></h2><p>Note: A few of these passages I list will explore evidence for Winterfell burning through dreams, prophecies, and omens. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are \u201cevidence,\u201d but I hope that with enough mention of them, they will start to culminate into coherent foreshadowing.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"376\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a9eedf22e1943379bc08fa02af05a3b/tumblr_inline_pjteftXGn91run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"376\"></figure><p><b>1. Summer\u2019s vision.</b> In Bran\u2019s wolf dream as Summer, he sees a curious vision that has been the subject of a lot of speculation over the years:</p><blockquote><p>The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky <b>he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame</b>. He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This was seen during Ramsay\u2019s burning of Winterfell. Now, I know that Summer uses \"wolf\u201d speak, for instance \u201cman-claws\u201d are swords and \u201chardskin\u201d is armor. So this image of a snake could be fire arrows or some type of catapult. Hence, this piece of evidence, by itself, is weak. However, to bring it back to dragons (which are a symbol of fire and blood according to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2267&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114809000\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a>), Bran relates the second burning of Winterfell to House Targaryen:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA wolf dream,\u201d said Bran. \u201cI smelled it too. Nothing smells like <b>fire, or blood</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>2. The Dothraki.</b> This second type of imagery also references conquerors. This exchange occurs right before Ramsay burns the castle:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe crows came in the blue dust, with the evening stars. \u201c<b>The Dothraki </b>believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead,\u201d Theon said. Maester Luwin had told him that, a long time ago.<br><b>\u201cDothraki?\u201d</b><br><b>\u201cThe horselords across the narrow sea.\u201d<br></b>\u201cOh. Them.\u201d Black Lorren frowned through his beard. \u201cSavages believe all manner of foolish things.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s a completely random line thrown in about the Dothraki. It comes out of nowhere at a significant time. Theon brings up the \u201chorselords from across the narrow sea\u201d a few lines before Ramsay torches the place. Moreover, Black Lorren dismisses the Dothraki as foolish savages, just like Black Harren dismissed Aegon\u2019s ability to melt his castle. This may be a foreshadowing a future event where the Dothraki come to Winterfell and kill the people there, like Ramsay did.</p><p><b>3. Fiery stallions.</b> The Stallion Who Mounts the World is a prophecy of the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAs swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the <b>milk men in the stone tents</b> will fear his name. The prince is riding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe stallion who mounts the world <b>will burn no cities now</b>. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Mirri Maz Duur (Daenerys, AGOT).</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"223\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02a2e45b2d52a6d4a088601a5228ed9a/tumblr_inline_pjtdw1HoJz1run9xa_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"223\"></figure><p>The Stallion is supposed to be the most powerful khal ever seen. Mirri is likely mistaken on this prophecy: it probably didn\u2019t not die with Rhaego, but lived on through Dany. The reason I bring up the prophecy as evidence for Winterfell burning a third time is because this passage occurs during the second burning of Winterfell:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnother man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. \u201cSave me the Freys,\u201d the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, \u201cand burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.\u201d<br>The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was <b>Smiler, kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze, screaming, rearing \u2026</b> \u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Smiler is a stallion - which should remind us of another stallion in the story:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cPerhaps one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his <b>fiery stallion</b> in the night lands and smiling down on me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And this one:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood <b>beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Again, the imagery of Dothraki and the stallion linked to Winterfell\u2019s 2nd burning is really curious. I get the feeling that this is foreshadowing something really important.</p><p><b>4. Burning heart trees.</b> After Theon\u2019s conquest of Winterfell, Stannis attempts to claim the North under the Baratheon/R\u2019hllor banner. He seeks a big victory to draw forces to his cause. He first attempts to do this by legitimizing Jon. However, Jon fears that this would mean turning the castle over to the red god, aka, the flames:</p><blockquote><p>The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said \u2026 but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots, and <b>feed it to the red woman\u2019s hungry fire god</b>. <i>I have no right. Winterfell belongs to the old gods.</i>\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Much like Winterfell\u2019s library burning, the loss of knowledge and the loss of something sacred might occur - the burning of the heart trees. The trees are like the religious temples for the Northerners. It\u2019s why Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s burning of the Sept and Dothraki sacred city, respectively, is hailed as a parallel dark event. It appears that, through the burning of religious sites, the author continues to remind the reader what is at stake and what could happen in the future. Moreover, burning food/nature/trees is also connected to \u201cDragons plant no trees,\u201d and the possibility that the heart tree might be destroyed by another set of \u00a0invaders from across the narrow sea\u2013the Dothraki\u2013like the Andals and the First Men before them.</p><p><b>5. Stark dreams.</b> The chapter after Ramsay burns Winterfell, Jon dreams of burning castles.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSleep came at last, and with it nightmares. He dreamed of <b>burning castles</b> and <b>dead men rising unquiet from their graves</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This dream could simply relate to Winterfell burning as it\u2019s happening in <i>Clash</i>, but we shouldn\u2019t dismiss the possibility of it being a future event. Since Dany\u2019s House of the Undying prophecy features past, present, and future events, we have to wonder if Jon is dreaming about Winterfell burning the 2nd time, the 3rd time, or both? The dead men rising could be Bran and Rickon rising from the crypts. But survivors could also hide in the crypts during the 3rd time as well.</p><p>Furthermore, in <i>Storm</i>, Arya encounters the brotherhood, led by R\u2019hllor, and has a bad dream that again suggests that Winterfell is burning:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cShe dreamt of home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. <b>It was not a good dream, </b>though. She was alone outside the castle, up to her knees in mud. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and the castle faded before her, <b>until it looked more like smoke than granite.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Arya, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Dreams are never clear-cut in terms of their relationship to time. So Winterfell going up in smoke sounds like a metaphor for an event that has already happened and one that could happen in the future.</p><p>To illustrate this further, toward the end of <i>Clash</i>, Theon also has a very Ebenezer Scrooge-like dream that he is dining with the dead from the past, present, and future. He sees the past: Ned, Robert, Ned\u2019s household guard, and all the men Theon killed at Winterfell. He sees a future event: Robb walking in (foreshadowing his death). He also sees the ghosts of the distant past: Brandon, Lyanna, and Rickard. The more vague imagery is reserved for the reader to guess: <i>\u201cAlong the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife.\u201d </i>Are they past, present, or future dead?</p><p>This past/present/future device reminds me that we might need to take a second look at the prophecy from the Ghost at High Heart:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, <b>drums</b> and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the <b>little bells</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Ghost of High Heart (Arya, ASOS)</p></blockquote><p>During the Red Wedding the bells on Jinglebell\u2019s hat are mentioned: <i>\u201cHis little bells were ringing, ringing, ringing, and the drum went boom doom boom.</i>\u201d So the prophecy could be fulfilled at that point. However, like Theon\u2019s dream, it could refer to past, present, and future. Maybe Battle of the Bells during Robert\u2019s Rebellion is the past, the Red Wedding the present, and the Dothraki the future (they wear tiny bells in their hair to symbolize their victories)? Jon also hears drums (\u201cdoom doom doom\u201d) above the crypts of Winterfell in one of his own dreams\u2013which is foreboding. In addition, this prophecy may be relevant for a future event; especially since Dany sees the Red Wedding in her own prophecy\u2013a fact that has <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://rose-of-red-lake.tumblr.com/post/180047158803/why-does-dany-see-the-red-wedding&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114821000\" target=\"_blank\">puzzled me</a> for years.</p><p><b>6. Burning castles and melting stone.</b> There are numerous references to burning stone/granite and burning/melting towers in the text.</p><p>In Theon\u2019s chapter, a point about granite not yielding easily to fire is mentioned as he returns to Winterfell after the 2nd burning:</p><blockquote><p>This place was scarred and broken, more ruin than redoubt, a haunt of crows and corpses. The great double curtain wall still stood, <b>for granite does not yield easily to fire</b>, but most of the towers and keeps within were roofless. A few had collapsed.\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, Stannis mentions to Jon how granite doesn\u2019t burn easily, while in the same breath emphasizing that the people matter more than the castle:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWinterfell is no more. Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch.\u201d<br>\u201c<b>Granite does not burn easily,</b>\u201d Stannis said. \u201cThe castle can be rebuilt, in time. <b>It\u2019s not the walls that make a lord, it\u2019s the man.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Which also echoes Ned\u2019s words to Jon:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo wall can keep you safe,\u201d his father had told him once, as they walked the walls of <b>Winterfell</b>. \u201c<b>A wall is only as strong as the men who defend it</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Emphasizing the importance of people - rather than walls - and also mentioning burning granite (even if it is difficult) seems significant. I\u2019m getting the sense that the Starks may lose their home but they\u2019ll be stronger for it. Home isn\u2019t necessarily a castle\u2013it\u2019s the people you want to be around.</p><p>Despite the mention of granite being difficult to melt, stone does melt eventually when dragons are involved. Harrenhal is important because of its prominence in the main story of ASOIAF. The burning of Harrenhal by Aegon is described this way:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[T]he towers of Harrenhal glowed red against the night, like f<b>ive great candles</b> \u2026 and like candles, they began to twist and melt, as <b>runnels of molten stone ran down their sides</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>And Northerners had eyes on the aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTorrhen\u2019s scouts had seen the ruins of Harrenhal, where <b>slow red fires still burned beneath the rubble</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"460\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f910ac76f9976c8dabb4c82cd16692b/tumblr_inline_pjte0hh3b41run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"460\"></figure><p><i>\u201cHarrenhal, on the north shore of the Gods Eye\u201d\u00a0by Lino Drieghe<br></i></p><p>The author wants to impart on the reader that even stone can melt; this detail may prove important later with Winterfell. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> also <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176121343152/look-at-it-nowa-blasted-ruin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114826000\" target=\"_blank\">discusses</a> how, even though the burning of Harrenhal was a game changer for warfare, Dany will most likely continue that game.</p><p>The Broken Tower at Winterfell is also known as the \u201cBurned Tower.\u201d It could also be foreshadowing for another storm/attack by fire, this time from dragons. Lighting also strikes the tower at Queenscrown as Jon is betraying Ygritte, while the Stark heir (Bran) uses it to stay hidden/protected. Jon also has a \u201cburned tower\u201d of his own. The Night\u2019s Watch recruits joke that Jon was the first recruit to burn down the Lord Commander\u2019s tower and get rewarded for it. Perhaps this is foreshadowing Jon fighting Dany with fire and causing destruction in his wake, but being \u201crewarded\u201d by being chosen as king.</p><p><b>7. Weddings and conquering.</b> Marriage as a key to winning nettlesome territory (Dorne, Crackclaw Point) is a reoccuring theme in the books. Dany encounters this dilemma in Meereen, when she has to decide between a wedding or perpetual war. It took 184 years for the Targaryens to set aside their blood purity and intermarry with the Dornish. Similarly, through Torrhen, the North was conquered under threat of dragonfire. The Targaryens dictated what would happen to Torrhen\u2019s family and arranged a marriage for his daughter to bind the North to the Vale.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe Targaryens also brokered many marriages between noble houses from the far ends of the realm, in hopes that such alliances would help tie the conquered lands together and make the seven kingdoms one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>Either with or without dragons, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/149750-why-is-the-north-talked-about-as-if-its-impossible-to-invade/%26do%3DfindComment%26comment%3D8092216&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114827000\" target=\"_blank\">North would be very difficult to conquer</a>. This is why marriage to the heir to Winterfell is important: it solidifies a family\u2019s hold on the North. Theon thought about this route during his invasion:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>His father thought only in terms of conquest, but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it?</b> Force and fear could carry you only so far. A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south; elsewise <b>Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them.</b> <b>Sansa</b> was a pretty little thing too, and by now likely even ripe for bedding. But she was a thousand leagues away, in the clutches of the Lannisters. A shame.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Marrying Tyrion to Sansa and Ramsay to fake Arya was another way these Stark outsiders secured the North - but it\u2019s clear that they would also need to hold it through force and fear, like Theon.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175878105372/history-is-a-wheel-jons-rebellion&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114829000\" target=\"_blank\">speculates</a>, the fact that the Sansa/Tyrion marriage has yet to be consummated or annulled may come into play at a later date. The ambiguity here seems to be intentional. A Tyrion/Stark marriage would benefit Dany, with Tyrion as her advisor claiming both the Westerlands and the North through a Stark daughter in Winterfell.</p><p>If Dany attempts to arrange marriages like her ancestor Rhaenys, she would be walking into a minefield. The idea of Sansa marrying again against her will is abhorrent. Therefore, if Dany wants to conquer the North and its people are more resistant to her than they were under Torrhen (which is likely), she will have a difficult time of it without getting Sansa\u2019s buy-in. Sansa holds a lot of soft power here.</p><p>However it plays out, the Stark with the most influence over the Lords is the person who would need to be married to someone with ties to the conqueror if he/she wants to hold the North. This pits Dany\u2019s desires for taking back all 7 kingdoms with her talents for playing the political marriage game (emphasized in Robb\u2019s storyline). If done in a ham-fisted way, Dany (or Tyrion, as her proxy) arranging marriages would be so explosive that I can see it causing another Dance of Dragons (a wedding or a war).</p><p><b>8. Comets.</b> This connection of dragons to the comet was also explored in another <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114830000\" target=\"_blank\">meta</a> by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>. Keep in mind that the first mention of the comet in the text doesn\u2019t occur in <i>Clash</i>, but in <i>Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cJhogo spied it first. \u201cThere,\u201d he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. <b>The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\u2019s tail.</b> She could not have asked for a stronger sign.<br>Dany took the torch from Aggo\u2019s hand and thrust it between the logs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The comet is an omen for dragons and is connected to Winterfell frequently in the text. Before Theon\u2019s invasion, the wolves were howling at the comet. Can wolves howling at the comet foreshadow dragons burning Winterfell? The subtext here is ominous:<br></p><blockquote><p>Maester Luwin did not think so. \u201cWolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.\u201d</p><p>When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. \u201cYour wolves have more wit than your maester,\u201d the wildling woman said. \u201cThey know truths the grey man has forgotten.\u201d The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, \u201c<b>Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.\u201d</b></p><p>\u2026Old Nan\u2026lived longer than any of them. \u201c<b>Dragons</b>,\u201d she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. <b>\u201cIt be dragons, boy,\u201d </b>she insisted.\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Since two wise elders (Nan and Osha) who are most clue-ed in to the story\u2019s history see the comet as a symbol of blood/fire/dragons, I think the evidence becomes much stronger that we will see direwolves vs. dragons in the future.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The direwolves know something is wrong and are warning Winterfell of a threat. The imagery of howling dogs was also used to herald Dany\u2019s birth in the show.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1172\" data-orig-height=\"661\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2d4c939a1f06622fba73cae7a4b5b22/tumblr_inline_pjte3wmECA1run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1172\" data-orig-height=\"661\"></figure><p>Aemon also believes that Daenerys is the savior in the prophecy Rhaegar was trying to piece together:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a <b>comet</b> had been seen above King\u2019s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and <b>Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet.</b> What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Samwell, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>I feel sorry for Aemon, because it might be important to ask if a bleeding star/comet is a good or a bad sign. No one seems to ask this! It\u2019s left up to the reader to pick up on the subtext here. Varys helps the foreshadowing move toward the negative, in this respect:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe have dire need of you on the council. Have you seen the comet?\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m short, not blind,\u201d Tyrion said. Out on the kingsroad, <b>it had seemed to cover half the sky, outshining the crescent moon.</b><br>\u201cIn the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,\u201d Varys said. \u201cThey say it comes as a herald before a king, <b>to warn of fire and blood to follow.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>- Tyrion, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>9. Spoilers for S8!</b> It does look like there is some kind of massive fire event going on at Winterfell based on filming reports and photos (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://watchersonthewall.com/major-new-game-of-thrones-season-8-spoilers-out-of-the-winterfell-set/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114834000\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Some people think this is Euron\u2019s work, or the Golden Company, but I think there are enough clues in the text to make Dany a strong contender for burning down the Northern stronghold.</p><p>I discuss more prophecy speculation for Winterfell burning in <a href=\"http://rose-of-red-lake.tumblr.com/post/181633045388/why-winterfell-will-probably-burn-again-part-ii\" target=\"_blank\">Part II</a>.\u00a0</p>",

I think the third time is most likely to be by dragonfire.</p><h2><b>Pre-Conquest history</b></h2><p>Before Aegon arrived, Winterfell was attacked by the Boltons, who burned it as part of a long-standing rivalry:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe enmity between the Starks and Boltons went back to the Long Night itself, it is claimed. The wars between these two ancient families were legion, and not all ended in victory for House Stark. <b>King Royce Bolton</b>, Second of His Name, <b>is said to have taken and burned Winterfell itself</b>; his namesake and descendant Royce IV\u2026 <b>did the same three centuries later.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoiAF</p></blockquote><p>Royce Bolton and his descendant attacked Winterfell twice. This means that Ramsay burning Winterfell falls on the <i>third time</i> for House Bolton.</p><p>Another event involved a natural disaster. We learn from Bran that the tower he likes to climb was struck by lightning in the distant past:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHis favorite haunt was <b>the broken tower</b>. Once it had been a <b>watchtower</b>, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, <b>a lightning strike had set it afire</b>. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t count these events in the rule of 3 because it happened pre-canon (not in the actual narrative). However it might be the first clue that something important is going to happen again around this tower. If plots come full circle, we may return to it at the end of the story.</p><h2><b>Close to dragonfire: The North meets Aegon I</b></h2><p>Before I describe (what I think is) foreshadowing for Winterfell burning, I\u2019d like to discuss a time when Winterfell almost burned by dragon fire. It was an extremely close-call.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The history of Torrhen kneeling to Aegon is oversimplified by the fandom at times. The prevailing view is that he was afraid of what Aegon would do, he knelt and spared his people, and everything was fine thereafter. However, Torrhen had assembled 30K Northern warriors who were ready to kick Aegon out of Westeros. His brother Brandon Snow offered to slay the dragons in their sleep. I doubt this bellicose sentiment evaporated with the bend of a knee. And in fact the World of Ice and Fire indicates there was discontent among the Northerners. Some denied allegiance to the Conqueror. A notable example is the Company of the Rose. Formed by \u201cwild men\u201d and women from the North, the Company of the Rose refused to bend the knee and instead chose exile across the narrow sea. They formed a sellsword company in Essos. The Company of the Rose is interesting because of rose symbolism and its links to Stark women.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"639\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99a9a8168c3d31101f91c5e25cfa23af/tumblr_inline_pjtdpfx6ZT1run9xa_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"639\"></figure><p><i>\u201cThe King Who Knelt\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/chasestone/art/The-King-Who-Knelt-497558606\" target=\"_blank\">Chase Stone</a><br></i></p><p>Torrhen\u2019s decision was also unwelcomed by own family:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTorrhen\u2019s sons were less glad of the Targaryen yoke, and some among them entertained talk of <b>rebelling</b>, and of raising the Stark banner whether Lord Torrhen consented or not.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>The text also brings up a Stark marriage arranged by Rhaenys:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhether anti-Targaryen feelings were made worse by Queen Rhaenys Targaryen\u2019s efforts to knit together the new, single realm with marriages between the great houses is left to the reader to consider. That Torrhen Stark\u2019s daughter was wed to the young and ill-fated Lord of the Vale is well-known; it was one of the many peace-binding marriages forged by Rhaenys.</p><p>But there are letters preserved at the Citadel <b>suggesting that Stark accepted these arrangements only after much protest, and that the bride\u2019s brothers refused to attend the wedding entirely</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>Refusing to attend the wedding is a sign that something was awry in the Targaryen/Stark relationship. The North gained little from this marriage and the Stark daughter was used to help the Targaryens secure the Vale. The Stark/Arryn marriage was also a disaster that did not bring peace. Ronnel Arryn, a child-lord, sounds exactly like Sweetrobin in his obsession with the moon door and flying. Ronnel was usurped by his brother Jonos, who declared himself the rightful lord and King of the Vale. Maegor flew to the Eyrie to crush the rebellion and Janos was betrayed by his own garrison (similar to Theon).</p><p>This bit of history seems important because it\u2019s the first instance of a daughter of Lord Stark in the Vale and has similarities to what the Lannisters did with Sansa. Torrhen\u2019s daughter was used as a pawn and her family was coerced into making this match. This backstory lends support to the theory that Dany will attempt her own marriage arrangements in Westeros, perhaps trying to use Sansa as a pawn.</p><p>To sum up, it is important to note that the North did resist the Targaryens the first time; they just did it in a subtle way. In light of this \u201chidden\u201d contempt, I don\u2019t believe the Northerners will be willing to accept another Torrhen-like decision the second time around, especially not after Robert\u2019s Rebellion, Robb\u2019s Rebellion, Bolton takeover, and a second rebellion against the crown by Jon and Sansa. The conditions Dany will face will be different than during Torrhen\u2019s time; plus, Torrhen did not have a hidden Targaryen heir in his pocket to challenge Aegon.</p><p>Now I want to talk about events related to Winterfell burning in the present setting.</p><h2><b>The first burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>Winterfell\u2019s library (also in a tower) is the first to be burned in the text. The wolves and dogs go berserk:</p><blockquote><p><b>The wolves were still howling</b>\u2026\u201cDogs,\u201d he said, listening. \u201c<b>All the dogs are barking. They\u2019ve never done that before \u2026</b> \u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cFire,\u201d he whispered\u2026\u201c<b>The library tower\u2019s on fire</b>,\u201d he said\u2026Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and <b>thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries.</b> Then she closed the shutters.</p><p>- Catelyn, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The loss of these books, and knowledge, is extremely sad. It feels like the first instance of Winterfell being torn apart, piece by piece. \u00a0</p><h2><b>The second burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>This time Winterfell is not only burned, the entire household is killed, much like Ned\u2019s household in King\u2019s Landing:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWinterfell.\u201d His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth. <i>One day when I come back I won\u2019t know how to talk anymore.</i> \u201c<b>It was Winterfell. It was all on fire. There were horse smells, and steel, and blood.</b> They killed everyone, Meera.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>( note the foreshadowing of Bran Bot here, with him not knowing how to talk ;_;)</p><p>And Summer relays how dangerous fire is to the reader:</p><blockquote><p><i>Men, many men, many horses, and <b>fire, fire, fire</b></i>. <b>No smell was more dangerous, </b>not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin.\u00a0</p><p>- Summer (Bran) ACOK</p></blockquote><p>The culprit isn\u2019t exactly Theon. It\u2019s Ramsay Bolton who infiltrates Winterfell and pretends to be a servant helping Theon in his mission:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnother man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. \u201cSave me the Freys,\u201d the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, \u201cand <b>burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>\u201cBurn it all\u201d sounds like a familiar refrain for a certain member of House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>Imagery suggesting Winterfell could burn a third time:</b></h2><p>Note: A few of these passages I list will explore evidence for Winterfell burning through dreams, prophecies, and omens. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are \u201cevidence,\u201d but I hope that with enough mention of them, they will start to culminate into coherent foreshadowing.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"376\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a9eedf22e1943379bc08fa02af05a3b/tumblr_inline_pjteftXGn91run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"376\"></figure><p><b>1. Summer\u2019s vision.</b> In Bran\u2019s wolf dream as Summer, he sees a curious vision that has been the subject of a lot of speculation over the years:</p><blockquote><p>The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky <b>he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame</b>. He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This was seen during Ramsay\u2019s burning of Winterfell. Now, I know that Summer uses \"wolf\u201d speak, for instance \u201cman-claws\u201d are swords and \u201chardskin\u201d is armor. So this image of a snake could be fire arrows or some type of catapult. Hence, this piece of evidence, by itself, is weak. However, to bring it back to dragons (which are a symbol of fire and blood according to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2267&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114809000\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a>), Bran relates the second burning of Winterfell to House Targaryen:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA wolf dream,\u201d said Bran. \u201cI smelled it too. Nothing smells like <b>fire, or blood</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>2. The Dothraki.</b> This second type of imagery also references conquerors. This exchange occurs right before Ramsay burns the castle:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe crows came in the blue dust, with the evening stars. \u201c<b>The Dothraki </b>believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead,\u201d Theon said. Maester Luwin had told him that, a long time ago.<br><b>\u201cDothraki?\u201d</b><br><b>\u201cThe horselords across the narrow sea.\u201d<br></b>\u201cOh. Them.\u201d Black Lorren frowned through his beard. \u201cSavages believe all manner of foolish things.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s a completely random line thrown in about the Dothraki. It comes out of nowhere at a significant time. Theon brings up the \u201chorselords from across the narrow sea\u201d a few lines before Ramsay torches the place. Moreover, Black Lorren dismisses the Dothraki as foolish savages, just like Black Harren dismissed Aegon\u2019s ability to melt his castle. This may be a foreshadowing a future event where the Dothraki come to Winterfell and kill the people there, like Ramsay did.</p><p><b>3. Fiery stallions.</b> The Stallion Who Mounts the World is a prophecy of the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAs swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the <b>milk men in the stone tents</b> will fear his name. The prince is riding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe stallion who mounts the world <b>will burn no cities now</b>. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Mirri Maz Duur (Daenerys, AGOT).</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"223\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02a2e45b2d52a6d4a088601a5228ed9a/tumblr_inline_pjtdw1HoJz1run9xa_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"223\"></figure><p>The Stallion is supposed to be the most powerful khal ever seen. Mirri is likely mistaken on this prophecy: it probably didn\u2019t not die with Rhaego, but lived on through Dany. The reason I bring up the prophecy as evidence for Winterfell burning a third time is because this passage occurs during the second burning of Winterfell:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAnother man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. \u201cSave me the Freys,\u201d the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, \u201cand burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.\u201d<br>The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was <b>Smiler, kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze, screaming, rearing \u2026</b> \u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Smiler is a stallion - which should remind us of another stallion in the story:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cPerhaps one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his <b>fiery stallion</b> in the night lands and smiling down on me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And this one:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood <b>beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Again, the imagery of Dothraki and the stallion linked to Winterfell\u2019s 2nd burning is really curious. I get the feeling that this is foreshadowing something really important.</p><p><b>4. Burning heart trees.</b> After Theon\u2019s conquest of Winterfell, Stannis attempts to claim the North under the Baratheon/R\u2019hllor banner. He seeks a big victory to draw forces to his cause. He first attempts to do this by legitimizing Jon. However, Jon fears that this would mean turning the castle over to the red god, aka, the flames:</p><blockquote><p>The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said \u2026 but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots, and <b>feed it to the red woman\u2019s hungry fire god</b>. <i>I have no right. Winterfell belongs to the old gods.</i>\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Much like Winterfell\u2019s library burning, the loss of knowledge and the loss of something sacred might occur - the burning of the heart trees. The trees are like the religious temples for the Northerners. It\u2019s why Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s burning of the Sept and Dothraki sacred city, respectively, is hailed as a parallel dark event. It appears that, through the burning of religious sites, the author continues to remind the reader what is at stake and what could happen in the future. Moreover, burning food/nature/trees is also connected to \u201cDragons plant no trees,\u201d and the possibility that the heart tree might be destroyed by another set of \u00a0invaders from across the narrow sea\u2013the Dothraki\u2013like the Andals and the First Men before them.</p><p><b>5. Stark dreams.</b> The chapter after Ramsay burns Winterfell, Jon dreams of burning castles.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSleep came at last, and with it nightmares. He dreamed of <b>burning castles</b> and <b>dead men rising unquiet from their graves</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This dream could simply relate to Winterfell burning as it\u2019s happening in <i>Clash</i>, but we shouldn\u2019t dismiss the possibility of it being a future event. Since Dany\u2019s House of the Undying prophecy features past, present, and future events, we have to wonder if Jon is dreaming about Winterfell burning the 2nd time, the 3rd time, or both? The dead men rising could be Bran and Rickon rising from the crypts. But survivors could also hide in the crypts during the 3rd time as well.</p><p>Furthermore, in <i>Storm</i>, Arya encounters the brotherhood, led by R\u2019hllor, and has a bad dream that again suggests that Winterfell is burning:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cShe dreamt of home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. <b>It was not a good dream, </b>though. She was alone outside the castle, up to her knees in mud. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and the castle faded before her, <b>until it looked more like smoke than granite.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Arya, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Dreams are never clear-cut in terms of their relationship to time. So Winterfell going up in smoke sounds like a metaphor for an event that has already happened and one that could happen in the future.</p><p>To illustrate this further, toward the end of <i>Clash</i>, Theon also has a very Ebenezer Scrooge-like dream that he is dining with the dead from the past, present, and future. He sees the past: Ned, Robert, Ned\u2019s household guard, and all the men Theon killed at Winterfell. He sees a future event: Robb walking in (foreshadowing his death). He also sees the ghosts of the distant past: Brandon, Lyanna, and Rickard. The more vague imagery is reserved for the reader to guess: <i>\u201cAlong the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife.\u201d </i>Are they past, present, or future dead?</p><p>This past/present/future device reminds me that we might need to take a second look at the prophecy from the Ghost at High Heart:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, <b>drums</b> and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the <b>little bells</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Ghost of High Heart (Arya, ASOS)</p></blockquote><p>During the Red Wedding the bells on Jinglebell\u2019s hat are mentioned: <i>\u201cHis little bells were ringing, ringing, ringing, and the drum went boom doom boom.</i>\u201d So the prophecy could be fulfilled at that point. However, like Theon\u2019s dream, it could refer to past, present, and future. Maybe Battle of the Bells during Robert\u2019s Rebellion is the past, the Red Wedding the present, and the Dothraki the future (they wear tiny bells in their hair to symbolize their victories)? Jon also hears drums (\u201cdoom doom doom\u201d) above the crypts of Winterfell in one of his own dreams\u2013which is foreboding. In addition, this prophecy may be relevant for a future event; especially since Dany sees the Red Wedding in her own prophecy\u2013a fact that has <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://rose-of-red-lake.tumblr.com/post/180047158803/why-does-dany-see-the-red-wedding&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114821000\" target=\"_blank\">puzzled me</a> for years.</p><p><b>6. Burning castles and melting stone.</b> There are numerous references to burning stone/granite and burning/melting towers in the text.</p><p>In Theon\u2019s chapter, a point about granite not yielding easily to fire is mentioned as he returns to Winterfell after the 2nd burning:</p><blockquote><p>This place was scarred and broken, more ruin than redoubt, a haunt of crows and corpses. The great double curtain wall still stood, <b>for granite does not yield easily to fire</b>, but most of the towers and keeps within were roofless. A few had collapsed.\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, Stannis mentions to Jon how granite doesn\u2019t burn easily, while in the same breath emphasizing that the people matter more than the castle:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWinterfell is no more. Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch.\u201d<br>\u201c<b>Granite does not burn easily,</b>\u201d Stannis said. \u201cThe castle can be rebuilt, in time. <b>It\u2019s not the walls that make a lord, it\u2019s the man.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Which also echoes Ned\u2019s words to Jon:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo wall can keep you safe,\u201d his father had told him once, as they walked the walls of <b>Winterfell</b>. \u201c<b>A wall is only as strong as the men who defend it</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Emphasizing the importance of people - rather than walls - and also mentioning burning granite (even if it is difficult) seems significant. I\u2019m getting the sense that the Starks may lose their home but they\u2019ll be stronger for it. Home isn\u2019t necessarily a castle\u2013it\u2019s the people you want to be around.</p><p>Despite the mention of granite being difficult to melt, stone does melt eventually when dragons are involved. Harrenhal is important because of its prominence in the main story of ASOIAF. The burning of Harrenhal by Aegon is described this way:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[T]he towers of Harrenhal glowed red against the night, like f<b>ive great candles</b> \u2026 and like candles, they began to twist and melt, as <b>runnels of molten stone ran down their sides</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>And Northerners had eyes on the aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cTorrhen\u2019s scouts had seen the ruins of Harrenhal, where <b>slow red fires still burned beneath the rubble</b>.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"460\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f910ac76f9976c8dabb4c82cd16692b/tumblr_inline_pjte0hh3b41run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"602\" data-orig-height=\"460\"></figure><p><i>\u201cHarrenhal, on the north shore of the Gods Eye\u201d\u00a0by Lino Drieghe<br></i></p><p>The author wants to impart on the reader that even stone can melt; this detail may prove important later with Winterfell. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> also <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176121343152/look-at-it-nowa-blasted-ruin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114826000\" target=\"_blank\">discusses</a> how, even though the burning of Harrenhal was a game changer for warfare, Dany will most likely continue that game.</p><p>The Broken Tower at Winterfell is also known as the \u201cBurned Tower.\u201d It could also be foreshadowing for another storm/attack by fire, this time from dragons. Lighting also strikes the tower at Queenscrown as Jon is betraying Ygritte, while the Stark heir (Bran) uses it to stay hidden/protected. Jon also has a \u201cburned tower\u201d of his own. The Night\u2019s Watch recruits joke that Jon was the first recruit to burn down the Lord Commander\u2019s tower and get rewarded for it. Perhaps this is foreshadowing Jon fighting Dany with fire and causing destruction in his wake, but being \u201crewarded\u201d by being chosen as king.</p><p><b>7. Weddings and conquering.</b> Marriage as a key to winning nettlesome territory (Dorne, Crackclaw Point) is a reoccuring theme in the books. Dany encounters this dilemma in Meereen, when she has to decide between a wedding or perpetual war. It took 184 years for the Targaryens to set aside their blood purity and intermarry with the Dornish. Similarly, through Torrhen, the North was conquered under threat of dragonfire. The Targaryens dictated what would happen to Torrhen\u2019s family and arranged a marriage for his daughter to bind the North to the Vale.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe Targaryens also brokered many marriages between noble houses from the far ends of the realm, in hopes that such alliances would help tie the conquered lands together and make the seven kingdoms one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>Either with or without dragons, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/149750-why-is-the-north-talked-about-as-if-its-impossible-to-invade/%26do%3DfindComment%26comment%3D8092216&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114827000\" target=\"_blank\">North would be very difficult to conquer</a>. This is why marriage to the heir to Winterfell is important: it solidifies a family\u2019s hold on the North. Theon thought about this route during his invasion:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>His father thought only in terms of conquest, but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it?</b> Force and fear could carry you only so far. A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south; elsewise <b>Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them.</b> <b>Sansa</b> was a pretty little thing too, and by now likely even ripe for bedding. But she was a thousand leagues away, in the clutches of the Lannisters. A shame.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Marrying Tyrion to Sansa and Ramsay to fake Arya was another way these Stark outsiders secured the North - but it\u2019s clear that they would also need to hold it through force and fear, like Theon.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175878105372/history-is-a-wheel-jons-rebellion&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114829000\" target=\"_blank\">speculates</a>, the fact that the Sansa/Tyrion marriage has yet to be consummated or annulled may come into play at a later date. The ambiguity here seems to be intentional. A Tyrion/Stark marriage would benefit Dany, with Tyrion as her advisor claiming both the Westerlands and the North through a Stark daughter in Winterfell.</p><p>If Dany attempts to arrange marriages like her ancestor Rhaenys, she would be walking into a minefield. The idea of Sansa marrying again against her will is abhorrent. Therefore, if Dany wants to conquer the North and its people are more resistant to her than they were under Torrhen (which is likely), she will have a difficult time of it without getting Sansa\u2019s buy-in. Sansa holds a lot of soft power here.</p><p>However it plays out, the Stark with the most influence over the Lords is the person who would need to be married to someone with ties to the conqueror if he/she wants to hold the North. This pits Dany\u2019s desires for taking back all 7 kingdoms with her talents for playing the political marriage game (emphasized in Robb\u2019s storyline). If done in a ham-fisted way, Dany (or Tyrion, as her proxy) arranging marriages would be so explosive that I can see it causing another Dance of Dragons (a wedding or a war).</p><p><b>8. Comets.</b> This connection of dragons to the comet was also explored in another <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114830000\" target=\"_blank\">meta</a> by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>. Keep in mind that the first mention of the comet in the text doesn\u2019t occur in <i>Clash</i>, but in <i>Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cJhogo spied it first. \u201cThere,\u201d he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. <b>The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\u2019s tail.</b> She could not have asked for a stronger sign.<br>Dany took the torch from Aggo\u2019s hand and thrust it between the logs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Daenerys, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The comet is an omen for dragons and is connected to Winterfell frequently in the text. Before Theon\u2019s invasion, the wolves were howling at the comet. Can wolves howling at the comet foreshadow dragons burning Winterfell? The subtext here is ominous:<br></p><blockquote><p>Maester Luwin did not think so. \u201cWolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.\u201d</p><p>When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. \u201cYour wolves have more wit than your maester,\u201d the wildling woman said. \u201cThey know truths the grey man has forgotten.\u201d The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, \u201c<b>Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.\u201d</b></p><p>\u2026Old Nan\u2026lived longer than any of them. \u201c<b>Dragons</b>,\u201d she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. <b>\u201cIt be dragons, boy,\u201d </b>she insisted.\u00a0</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Since two wise elders (Nan and Osha) who are most clue-ed in to the story\u2019s history see the comet as a symbol of blood/fire/dragons, I think the evidence becomes much stronger that we will see direwolves vs. dragons in the future.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0The direwolves know something is wrong and are warning Winterfell of a threat. The imagery of howling dogs was also used to herald Dany\u2019s birth in the show.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1172\" data-orig-height=\"661\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2d4c939a1f06622fba73cae7a4b5b22/tumblr_inline_pjte3wmECA1run9xa_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1172\" data-orig-height=\"661\"></figure><p>Aemon also believes that Daenerys is the savior in the prophecy Rhaegar was trying to piece together:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a <b>comet</b> had been seen above King\u2019s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and <b>Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet.</b> What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>- Samwell, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>I feel sorry for Aemon, because it might be important to ask if a bleeding star/comet is a good or a bad sign. No one seems to ask this! It\u2019s left up to the reader to pick up on the subtext here. Varys helps the foreshadowing move toward the negative, in this respect:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe have dire need of you on the council. Have you seen the comet?\u201d<br>\u201cI\u2019m short, not blind,\u201d Tyrion said. Out on the kingsroad, <b>it had seemed to cover half the sky, outshining the crescent moon.</b><br>\u201cIn the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,\u201d Varys said. \u201cThey say it comes as a herald before a king, <b>to warn of fire and blood to follow.\u201d\u00a0</b></p><p>- Tyrion, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>9. Spoilers for S8!</b> It does look like there is some kind of massive fire event going on at Winterfell based on filming reports and photos (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://watchersonthewall.com/major-new-game-of-thrones-season-8-spoilers-out-of-the-winterfell-set/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114834000\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Some people think this is Euron\u2019s work, or the Golden Company, but I think there are enough clues in the text to make Dany a strong contender for burning down the Northern stronghold.</p><p>I discuss more prophecy speculation for Winterfell burning in <a href=\"http://rose-of-red-lake.tumblr.com/post/181633045388/why-winterfell-will-probably-burn-again-part-ii\" target=\"_blank\">Part II</a>.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>This post contains potential spoilers for Season 8.<br /></i></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe46bed7373964b8ddb7779e809f8ad5/tumblr_inline_pjtdoy25Je1run9xa_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Winterfell has burned three times in pre-canon (pre-Game of Thrones) events:</p><ol><li>Royce Bolton II<br /></li><li>Royce Bolton IV<br /></li><li>By lighting strike<br /></li></ol><p>And in the main ASOIAF narrative, Winterfell has burned twice:</p><ol><li>The library tower<br /></li><li>Theon&rsquo;s invasion/Ramsay Bolton<br /></li></ol><p>I will explore evidence for Winterfell burning a third time (rule of three). I think the third time is most likely to be by dragonfire.</p><h2><b>Pre-Conquest history</b></h2><p>Before Aegon arrived, Winterfell was attacked by the Boltons, who burned it as part of a long-standing rivalry:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The enmity between the Starks and Boltons went back to the Long Night itself, it is claimed. The wars between these two ancient families were legion, and not all ended in victory for House Stark. <b>King Royce Bolton</b>, Second of His Name, <b>is said to have taken and burned Winterfell itself</b>; his namesake and descendant Royce IV&hellip; <b>did the same three centuries later.</b>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- WoiAF</p></blockquote><p>Royce Bolton and his descendant attacked Winterfell twice. This means that Ramsay burning Winterfell falls on the <i>third time</i> for House Bolton.</p><p>Another event involved a natural disaster. We learn from Bran that the tower he likes to climb was struck by lightning in the distant past:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;His favorite haunt was <b>the broken tower</b>. Once it had been a <b>watchtower</b>, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, <b>a lightning strike had set it afire</b>. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Bran, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t count these events in the rule of 3 because it happened pre-canon (not in the actual narrative). However it might be the first clue that something important is going to happen again around this tower. If plots come full circle, we may return to it at the end of the story.</p><h2><b>Close to dragonfire: The North meets Aegon I</b></h2><p>Before I describe (what I think is) foreshadowing for Winterfell burning, I&rsquo;d like to discuss a time when Winterfell almost burned by dragon fire. It was an extremely close-call.</p><p>The history of Torrhen kneeling to Aegon is oversimplified by the fandom at times. The prevailing view is that he was afraid of what Aegon would do, he knelt and spared his people, and everything was fine thereafter. However, Torrhen had assembled 30K Northern warriors who were ready to kick Aegon out of Westeros. His brother Brandon Snow offered to slay the dragons in their sleep. I doubt this bellicose sentiment evaporated with the bend of a knee. And in fact the World of Ice and Fire indicates there was discontent among the Northerners. Some denied allegiance to the Conqueror. A notable example is the Company of the Rose. Formed by &ldquo;wild men&rdquo; and women from the North, the Company of the Rose refused to bend the knee and instead chose exile across the narrow sea. They formed a sellsword company in Essos. The Company of the Rose is interesting because of rose symbolism and its links to Stark women.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99a9a8168c3d31101f91c5e25cfa23af/tumblr_inline_pjtdpfx6ZT1run9xa_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>&ldquo;The King Who Knelt&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/chasestone/art/The-King-Who-Knelt-497558606\" target=\"_blank\">Chase Stone</a><br /></i></p><p>Torrhen&rsquo;s decision was also unwelcomed by own family:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Torrhen&rsquo;s sons were less glad of the Targaryen yoke, and some among them entertained talk of <b>rebelling</b>, and of raising the Stark banner whether Lord Torrhen consented or not.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>The text also brings up a Stark marriage arranged by Rhaenys:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whether anti-Targaryen feelings were made worse by Queen Rhaenys Targaryen&rsquo;s efforts to knit together the new, single realm with marriages between the great houses is left to the reader to consider. That Torrhen Stark&rsquo;s daughter was wed to the young and ill-fated Lord of the Vale is well-known; it was one of the many peace-binding marriages forged by Rhaenys.</p><p>But there are letters preserved at the Citadel <b>suggesting that Stark accepted these arrangements only after much protest, and that the bride&rsquo;s brothers refused to attend the wedding entirely</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- WoIaF</p></blockquote><p>Refusing to attend the wedding is a sign that something was awry in the Targaryen/Stark relationship. The North gained little from this marriage and the Stark daughter was used to help the Targaryens secure the Vale. The Stark/Arryn marriage was also a disaster that did not bring peace. Ronnel Arryn, a child-lord, sounds exactly like Sweetrobin in his obsession with the moon door and flying. Ronnel was usurped by his brother Jonos, who declared himself the rightful lord and King of the Vale. Maegor flew to the Eyrie to crush the rebellion and Janos was betrayed by his own garrison (similar to Theon).</p><p>This bit of history seems important because it&rsquo;s the first instance of a daughter of Lord Stark in the Vale and has similarities to what the Lannisters did with Sansa. Torrhen&rsquo;s daughter was used as a pawn and her family was coerced into making this match. This backstory lends support to the theory that Dany will attempt her own marriage arrangements in Westeros, perhaps trying to use Sansa as a pawn.</p><p>To sum up, it is important to note that the North did resist the Targaryens the first time; they just did it in a subtle way. In light of this &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; contempt, I don&rsquo;t believe the Northerners will be willing to accept another Torrhen-like decision the second time around, especially not after Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion, Robb&rsquo;s Rebellion, Bolton takeover, and a second rebellion against the crown by Jon and Sansa. The conditions Dany will face will be different than during Torrhen&rsquo;s time; plus, Torrhen did not have a hidden Targaryen heir in his pocket to challenge Aegon.</p><p>Now I want to talk about events related to Winterfell burning in the present setting.</p><h2><b>The first burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>Winterfell&rsquo;s library (also in a tower) is the first to be burned in the text. The wolves and dogs go berserk:</p><blockquote><p><b>The wolves were still howling</b>&hellip;&ldquo;Dogs,&rdquo; he said, listening. &ldquo;<b>All the dogs are barking. They&rsquo;ve never done that before &hellip;</b> &rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; he whispered&hellip;&ldquo;<b>The library tower&rsquo;s on fire</b>,&rdquo; he said&hellip;Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and <b>thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries.</b> Then she closed the shutters.</p><p>- Catelyn, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The loss of these books, and knowledge, is extremely sad. It feels like the first instance of Winterfell being torn apart, piece by piece. &nbsp;</p><h2><b>The second burning in the narrative:</b></h2><p>This time Winterfell is not only burned, the entire household is killed, much like Ned&rsquo;s household in King&rsquo;s Landing:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Winterfell.&rdquo; His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth. <i>One day when I come back I won&rsquo;t know how to talk anymore.</i> &ldquo;<b>It was Winterfell. It was all on fire. There were horse smells, and steel, and blood.</b> They killed everyone, Meera.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>( note the foreshadowing of Bran Bot here, with him not knowing how to talk ;_;)</p><p>And Summer relays how dangerous fire is to the reader:</p><blockquote><p><i>Men, many men, many horses, and <b>fire, fire, fire</b></i>. <b>No smell was more dangerous, </b>not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin.&nbsp;</p><p>- Summer (Bran) ACOK</p></blockquote><p>The culprit isn&rsquo;t exactly Theon. It&rsquo;s Ramsay Bolton who infiltrates Winterfell and pretends to be a servant helping Theon in his mission:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. &ldquo;Save me the Freys,&rdquo; the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, &ldquo;and <b>burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.</b>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Burn it all&rdquo; sounds like a familiar refrain for a certain member of House Targaryen.</p><h2><b>Imagery suggesting Winterfell could burn a third time:</b></h2><p>Note: A few of these passages I list will explore evidence for Winterfell burning through dreams, prophecies, and omens. I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that they are &ldquo;evidence,&rdquo; but I hope that with enough mention of them, they will start to culminate into coherent foreshadowing.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a9eedf22e1943379bc08fa02af05a3b/tumblr_inline_pjteftXGn91run9xa_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>1. Summer&rsquo;s vision.</b> In Bran&rsquo;s wolf dream as Summer, he sees a curious vision that has been the subject of a lot of speculation over the years:</p><blockquote><p>The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky <b>he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame</b>. He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This was seen during Ramsay&rsquo;s burning of Winterfell. Now, I know that Summer uses \"wolf&rdquo; speak, for instance &ldquo;man-claws&rdquo; are swords and &ldquo;hardskin&rdquo; is armor. So this image of a snake could be fire arrows or some type of catapult. Hence, this piece of evidence, by itself, is weak. However, to bring it back to dragons (which are a symbol of fire and blood according to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2267&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114809000\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a>), Bran relates the second burning of Winterfell to House Targaryen:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A wolf dream,&rdquo; said Bran. &ldquo;I smelled it too. Nothing smells like <b>fire, or blood</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>2. The Dothraki.</b> This second type of imagery also references conquerors. This exchange occurs right before Ramsay burns the castle:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The crows came in the blue dust, with the evening stars. &ldquo;<b>The Dothraki </b>believe the stars are spirits of the valiant dead,&rdquo; Theon said. Maester Luwin had told him that, a long time ago.<br /><b>&ldquo;Dothraki?&rdquo;</b><br /><b>&ldquo;The horselords across the narrow sea.&rdquo;<br /></b>&ldquo;Oh. Them.&rdquo; Black Lorren frowned through his beard. &ldquo;Savages believe all manner of foolish things.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a completely random line thrown in about the Dothraki. It comes out of nowhere at a significant time. Theon brings up the &ldquo;horselords from across the narrow sea&rdquo; a few lines before Ramsay torches the place. Moreover, Black Lorren dismisses the Dothraki as foolish savages, just like Black Harren dismissed Aegon&rsquo;s ability to melt his castle. This may be a foreshadowing a future event where the Dothraki come to Winterfell and kill the people there, like Ramsay did.</p><p><b>3. Fiery stallions.</b> The Stallion Who Mounts the World is a prophecy of the Dothraki:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the <b>milk men in the stone tents</b> will fear his name. The prince is riding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The stallion who mounts the world <b>will burn no cities now</b>. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Mirri Maz Duur (Daenerys, AGOT).</p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02a2e45b2d52a6d4a088601a5228ed9a/tumblr_inline_pjtdw1HoJz1run9xa_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The Stallion is supposed to be the most powerful khal ever seen. Mirri is likely mistaken on this prophecy: it probably didn&rsquo;t not die with Rhaego, but lived on through Dany. The reason I bring up the prophecy as evidence for Winterfell burning a third time is because this passage occurs during the second burning of Winterfell:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. &ldquo;Save me the Freys,&rdquo; the Bastard was shouting as the flames roared upward, &ldquo;and burn the rest. Burn it, burn it all.&rdquo;<br />The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was <b>Smiler, kicking free of the burning stables with his mane ablaze, screaming, rearing &hellip;</b> &rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Smiler is a stallion - which should remind us of another stallion in the story:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Perhaps one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his <b>fiery stallion</b> in the night lands and smiling down on me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Daenerys, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>And this one:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood <b>beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him.</b>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Daenerys, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Again, the imagery of Dothraki and the stallion linked to Winterfell&rsquo;s 2nd burning is really curious. I get the feeling that this is foreshadowing something really important.</p><p><b>4. Burning heart trees.</b> After Theon&rsquo;s conquest of Winterfell, Stannis attempts to claim the North under the Baratheon/R&rsquo;hllor banner. He seeks a big victory to draw forces to his cause. He first attempts to do this by legitimizing Jon. However, Jon fears that this would mean turning the castle over to the red god, aka, the flames:</p><blockquote><p>The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said &hellip; but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots, and <b>feed it to the red woman&rsquo;s hungry fire god</b>. <i>I have no right. Winterfell belongs to the old gods.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Much like Winterfell&rsquo;s library burning, the loss of knowledge and the loss of something sacred might occur - the burning of the heart trees. The trees are like the religious temples for the Northerners. It&rsquo;s why Cersei&rsquo;s and Dany&rsquo;s burning of the Sept and Dothraki sacred city, respectively, is hailed as a parallel dark event. It appears that, through the burning of religious sites, the author continues to remind the reader what is at stake and what could happen in the future. Moreover, burning food/nature/trees is also connected to &ldquo;Dragons plant no trees,&rdquo; and the possibility that the heart tree might be destroyed by another set of &nbsp;invaders from across the narrow sea&ndash;the Dothraki&ndash;like the Andals and the First Men before them.</p><p><b>5. Stark dreams.</b> The chapter after Ramsay burns Winterfell, Jon dreams of burning castles.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sleep came at last, and with it nightmares. He dreamed of <b>burning castles</b> and <b>dead men rising unquiet from their graves</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Jon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>This dream could simply relate to Winterfell burning as it&rsquo;s happening in <i>Clash</i>, but we shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss the possibility of it being a future event. Since Dany&rsquo;s House of the Undying prophecy features past, present, and future events, we have to wonder if Jon is dreaming about Winterfell burning the 2nd time, the 3rd time, or both? The dead men rising could be Bran and Rickon rising from the crypts. But survivors could also hide in the crypts during the 3rd time as well.</p><p>Furthermore, in <i>Storm</i>, Arya encounters the brotherhood, led by R&rsquo;hllor, and has a bad dream that again suggests that Winterfell is burning:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;She dreamt of home; not Riverrun, but Winterfell. <b>It was not a good dream, </b>though. She was alone outside the castle, up to her knees in mud. She could see the grey walls ahead of her, but when she tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and the castle faded before her, <b>until it looked more like smoke than granite.</b>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Arya, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Dreams are never clear-cut in terms of their relationship to time. So Winterfell going up in smoke sounds like a metaphor for an event that has already happened and one that could happen in the future.</p><p>To illustrate this further, toward the end of <i>Clash</i>, Theon also has a very Ebenezer Scrooge-like dream that he is dining with the dead from the past, present, and future. He sees the past: Ned, Robert, Ned&rsquo;s household guard, and all the men Theon killed at Winterfell. He sees a future event: Robb walking in (foreshadowing his death). He also sees the ghosts of the distant past: Brandon, Lyanna, and Rickard. The more vague imagery is reserved for the reader to guess: <i>&ldquo;Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife.&rdquo; </i>Are they past, present, or future dead?</p><p>This past/present/future device reminds me that we might need to take a second look at the prophecy from the Ghost at High Heart:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I dreamt such a clangor I thought my head might burst, <b>drums</b> and horns and pipes and screams, but the saddest sound was the <b>little bells</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Ghost of High Heart (Arya, ASOS)</p></blockquote><p>During the Red Wedding the bells on Jinglebell&rsquo;s hat are mentioned: <i>&ldquo;His little bells were ringing, ringing, ringing, and the drum went boom doom boom.</i>&rdquo; So the prophecy could be fulfilled at that point. However, like Theon&rsquo;s dream, it could refer to past, present, and future. Maybe Battle of the Bells during Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion is the past, the Red Wedding the present, and the Dothraki the future (they wear tiny bells in their hair to symbolize their victories)? Jon also hears drums (&ldquo;doom doom doom&rdquo;) above the crypts of Winterfell in one of his own dreams&ndash;which is foreboding. In addition, this prophecy may be relevant for a future event; especially since Dany sees the Red Wedding in her own prophecy&ndash;a fact that has <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://rose-of-red-lake.tumblr.com/post/180047158803/why-does-dany-see-the-red-wedding&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114821000\" target=\"_blank\">puzzled me</a> for years.</p><p><b>6. Burning castles and melting stone.</b> There are numerous references to burning stone/granite and burning/melting towers in the text.</p><p>In Theon&rsquo;s chapter, a point about granite not yielding easily to fire is mentioned as he returns to Winterfell after the 2nd burning:</p><blockquote><p>This place was scarred and broken, more ruin than redoubt, a haunt of crows and corpses. The great double curtain wall still stood, <b>for granite does not yield easily to fire</b>, but most of the towers and keeps within were roofless. A few had collapsed.&nbsp;</p><p>- Theon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, Stannis mentions to Jon how granite doesn&rsquo;t burn easily, while in the same breath emphasizing that the people matter more than the castle:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Winterfell is no more. Theon Greyjoy put it to the torch.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;<b>Granite does not burn easily,</b>&rdquo; Stannis said. &ldquo;The castle can be rebuilt, in time. <b>It&rsquo;s not the walls that make a lord, it&rsquo;s the man.</b>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Jon, ADWD</p></blockquote><p>Which also echoes Ned&rsquo;s words to Jon:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No wall can keep you safe,&rdquo; his father had told him once, as they walked the walls of <b>Winterfell</b>. &ldquo;<b>A wall is only as strong as the men who defend it</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Jon, ASOS</p></blockquote><p>Emphasizing the importance of people - rather than walls - and also mentioning burning granite (even if it is difficult) seems significant. I&rsquo;m getting the sense that the Starks may lose their home but they&rsquo;ll be stronger for it. Home isn&rsquo;t necessarily a castle&ndash;it&rsquo;s the people you want to be around.</p><p>Despite the mention of granite being difficult to melt, stone does melt eventually when dragons are involved. Harrenhal is important because of its prominence in the main story of ASOIAF. The burning of Harrenhal by Aegon is described this way:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[T]he towers of Harrenhal glowed red against the night, like f<b>ive great candles</b> &hellip; and like candles, they began to twist and melt, as <b>runnels of molten stone ran down their sides</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>And Northerners had eyes on the aftermath:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Torrhen&rsquo;s scouts had seen the ruins of Harrenhal, where <b>slow red fires still burned beneath the rubble</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f910ac76f9976c8dabb4c82cd16692b/tumblr_inline_pjte0hh3b41run9xa_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>&ldquo;Harrenhal, on the north shore of the Gods Eye&rdquo;&nbsp;by Lino Drieghe<br /></i></p><p>The author wants to impart on the reader that even stone can melt; this detail may prove important later with Winterfell. <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> also <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/176121343152/look-at-it-nowa-blasted-ruin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114826000\" target=\"_blank\">discusses</a> how, even though the burning of Harrenhal was a game changer for warfare, Dany will most likely continue that game.</p><p>The Broken Tower at Winterfell is also known as the &ldquo;Burned Tower.&rdquo; It could also be foreshadowing for another storm/attack by fire, this time from dragons. Lighting also strikes the tower at Queenscrown as Jon is betraying Ygritte, while the Stark heir (Bran) uses it to stay hidden/protected. Jon also has a &ldquo;burned tower&rdquo; of his own. The Night&rsquo;s Watch recruits joke that Jon was the first recruit to burn down the Lord Commander&rsquo;s tower and get rewarded for it. Perhaps this is foreshadowing Jon fighting Dany with fire and causing destruction in his wake, but being &ldquo;rewarded&rdquo; by being chosen as king.</p><p><b>7. Weddings and conquering.</b> Marriage as a key to winning nettlesome territory (Dorne, Crackclaw Point) is a reoccuring theme in the books. Dany encounters this dilemma in Meereen, when she has to decide between a wedding or perpetual war. It took 184 years for the Targaryens to set aside their blood purity and intermarry with the Dornish. Similarly, through Torrhen, the North was conquered under threat of dragonfire. The Targaryens dictated what would happen to Torrhen&rsquo;s family and arranged a marriage for his daughter to bind the North to the Vale.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Targaryens also brokered many marriages between noble houses from the far ends of the realm, in hopes that such alliances would help tie the conquered lands together and make the seven kingdoms one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Fire &amp; Blood</p></blockquote><p>Either with or without dragons, the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/149750-why-is-the-north-talked-about-as-if-its-impossible-to-invade/%26do%3DfindComment%26comment%3D8092216&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114827000\" target=\"_blank\">North would be very difficult to conquer</a>. This is why marriage to the heir to Winterfell is important: it solidifies a family&rsquo;s hold on the North. Theon thought about this route during his invasion:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<b>His father thought only in terms of conquest, but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it?</b> Force and fear could carry you only so far. A pity Ned Stark had taken his daughters south; elsewise <b>Theon could have tightened his grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them.</b> <b>Sansa</b> was a pretty little thing too, and by now likely even ripe for bedding. But she was a thousand leagues away, in the clutches of the Lannisters. A shame.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Theon, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Marrying Tyrion to Sansa and Ramsay to fake Arya was another way these Stark outsiders secured the North - but it&rsquo;s clear that they would also need to hold it through force and fear, like Theon.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175878105372/history-is-a-wheel-jons-rebellion&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114829000\" target=\"_blank\">speculates</a>, the fact that the Sansa/Tyrion marriage has yet to be consummated or annulled may come into play at a later date. The ambiguity here seems to be intentional. A Tyrion/Stark marriage would benefit Dany, with Tyrion as her advisor claiming both the Westerlands and the North through a Stark daughter in Winterfell.</p><p>If Dany attempts to arrange marriages like her ancestor Rhaenys, she would be walking into a minefield. The idea of Sansa marrying again against her will is abhorrent. Therefore, if Dany wants to conquer the North and its people are more resistant to her than they were under Torrhen (which is likely), she will have a difficult time of it without getting Sansa&rsquo;s buy-in. Sansa holds a lot of soft power here.</p><p>However it plays out, the Stark with the most influence over the Lords is the person who would need to be married to someone with ties to the conqueror if he/she wants to hold the North. This pits Dany&rsquo;s desires for taking back all 7 kingdoms with her talents for playing the political marriage game (emphasized in Robb&rsquo;s storyline). If done in a ham-fisted way, Dany (or Tyrion, as her proxy) arranging marriages would be so explosive that I can see it causing another Dance of Dragons (a wedding or a war).</p><p><b>8. Comets.</b> This connection of dragons to the comet was also explored in another <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114830000\" target=\"_blank\">meta</a> by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\" target=\"_blank\">@lostlittlesatellites</a>. Keep in mind that the first mention of the comet in the text doesn&rsquo;t occur in <i>Clash</i>, but in <i>Thrones</i>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jhogo spied it first. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. <b>The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon&rsquo;s tail.</b> She could not have asked for a stronger sign.<br />Dany took the torch from Aggo&rsquo;s hand and thrust it between the logs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Daenerys, AGOT</p></blockquote><p>The comet is an omen for dragons and is connected to Winterfell frequently in the text. Before Theon&rsquo;s invasion, the wolves were howling at the comet. Can wolves howling at the comet foreshadow dragons burning Winterfell? The subtext here is ominous:<br /></p><blockquote><p>Maester Luwin did not think so. &ldquo;Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.&rdquo;</p><p>When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. &ldquo;Your wolves have more wit than your maester,&rdquo; the wildling woman said. &ldquo;They know truths the grey man has forgotten.&rdquo; The way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, &ldquo;<b>Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&hellip;Old Nan&hellip;lived longer than any of them. &ldquo;<b>Dragons</b>,&rdquo; she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. <b>&ldquo;It be dragons, boy,&rdquo; </b>she insisted.&nbsp;</p><p>- Bran, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Since two wise elders (Nan and Osha) who are most clue-ed in to the story&rsquo;s history see the comet as a symbol of blood/fire/dragons, I think the evidence becomes much stronger that we will see direwolves vs. dragons in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The direwolves know something is wrong and are warning Winterfell of a threat. The imagery of howling dogs was also used to herald Dany&rsquo;s birth in the show.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2d4c939a1f06622fba73cae7a4b5b22/tumblr_inline_pjte3wmECA1run9xa_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Aemon also believes that Daenerys is the savior in the prophecy Rhaegar was trying to piece together:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a <b>comet</b> had been seen above King&rsquo;s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and <b>Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet.</b> What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>- Samwell, AFFC</p></blockquote><p>I feel sorry for Aemon, because it might be important to ask if a bleeding star/comet is a good or a bad sign. No one seems to ask this! It&rsquo;s left up to the reader to pick up on the subtext here. Varys helps the foreshadowing move toward the negative, in this respect:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have dire need of you on the council. Have you seen the comet?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m short, not blind,&rdquo; Tyrion said. Out on the kingsroad, <b>it had seemed to cover half the sky, outshining the crescent moon.</b><br />&ldquo;In the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,&rdquo; Varys said. &ldquo;They say it comes as a herald before a king, <b>to warn of fire and blood to follow.&rdquo;&nbsp;</b></p><p>- Tyrion, ACOK</p></blockquote><p><b>9. Spoilers for S8!</b> It does look like there is some kind of massive fire event going on at Winterfell based on filming reports and photos (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://watchersonthewall.com/major-new-game-of-thrones-season-8-spoilers-out-of-the-winterfell-set/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1544940114834000\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Some people think this is Euron&rsquo;s work, or the Golden Company, but I think there are enough clues in the text to make Dany a strong contender for burning down the Northern stronghold.</p><p>I discuss more prophecy speculation for Winterfell burning in <a href=\"http://rose-of-red-lake.tumblr.com/post/181633045388/why-winterfell-will-probably-burn-again-part-ii\" target=\"_blank\">Part II</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

I think the third time is most likely to be by dragonfire.</p>\n<h2><b>Pre-Conquest history</b></h2>\n<p>Before Aegon arrived, Winterfell was attacked by the Boltons, who burned it as part of a long-standing rivalry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The enmity between the Starks and Boltons went back to the Long Night itself, it is claimed. The wars between these two ancient families were legion, and not all ended in victory for House Stark. <b>King Royce Bolton</b>, Second of His Name, <b>is said to have taken and burned Winterfell itself</b>; his namesake and descendant Royce IV&hellip; <b>did the same three centuries later.</b>&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- WoiAF</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Royce Bolton and his descendant attacked Winterfell twice. This means that Ramsay burning Winterfell falls on the <i>third time</i> for House Bolton.</p>\n<p>Another event involved a natural disaster. We learn from Bran that the tower he likes to climb was struck by lightning in the distant past:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;His favorite haunt was <b>the broken tower</b>. Once it had been a <b>watchtower</b>, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, <b>a lightning strike had set it afire</b>. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- Bran, AGOT</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t count these events in the rule of 3 because it happened pre-canon (not in the actual narrative). However it might be the first clue that something important is going to happen again around this tower. If plots come full circle, we may return to it at the end of the story.</p>\n<h2><b>Close to dragonfire: The North meets Aegon I</b></h2>\n<p>Before I describe (what I think is) foreshadowing for Winterfell burning, I&rsquo;d like to discuss a time when Winterfell almost burned by dragon fire. It was an extremely close-call.</p>\n</p>",
