I think one of the things that should be taken into consideration is what the subject themselves put into the public sphere though. If you put something on social media, it no longer belongs to you. That\u2019s a harsh reality. On the other hand, I think when a person is are taking something, whether it be a image or information, and transforming it, they should also have a responsibility to act morally/ethically in how they are using it. I think in a lot of cases people don\u2019t do that. In the phandom specifically, I think there are a lot of issues that arise because a lot of the \u201ctransformative work\u201d is sexually explicit and inherently objectifies Dan and Phil and because it is posted on social media in places where they, as social media influencers, conduct their business, there is a lot of gray area with regards to sexual harassment. There are so many additional issues that arise from a lot of the fan fiction and fan art because it is pornographic in nature. For example, is it alright for adults to write porn about minors and/or for minors? Is it alright to graphically portray a real person being a victim of sexual violence (whether they see it or not)? The only thing I do know for sure is that anyone who tries to deny there are big moral/ethical questions raised by this type of activity in real person fandoms is irresponsible at best and probably shouldn\u2019t be engaging in any of it. </p>",

The same exact way girls can tell each other they look pretty all day long and nobody bats an eyeball. You can be a girl, and think another girl is attractive, without being attracted to girls. So if Dan, or any man expresses that he thinks another man looks good and your first reaction is to assume he must be gay, congrats, your idea of masculinity is toxic and you aren\u2019t sure how sexualities work. </p><p>The man doesn\u2019t like labels. He\u2019s said that.
