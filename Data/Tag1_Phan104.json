        "question": "Isnt dan into one direction ? (Or was) Like he make it look like a joke but he does really love them right ? He went to a concert and i think sing the songs and stuff? Maybe he is just very curious about all of that(the tinhat) like some humans can be. He shouldnt talk about it in front of people who look up to him but its not that bad to be curious about a popular thing, not like he is making the conspiracies himself",
        "answer": "<p>I am not sure how Dan feels about One Direction. I remember him going to the concert with Louise and the other British YouTubers, but since I was never a follower of the band, I never paid attention to what he said about them. As for his comments, I think they were irresponsible, but at the time I doubt anyone could have predicted that people would say Louis\u2019s son was a doll and everything else. I still can\u2019t really defend Dan here completely, but I also don\u2019t feel like I need to. A lot of people in the phandom put him up on a pedistal and then get upset when he doesn\u2019t live up to their expectations or upset at others when they are critical of something he does. I think that\u2019s all counterproductive and unfair. He\u2019s a human who makes mistakes just like the rest of us and that realness is why I started watching him in the first place. </p>",

Coffee</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/10848915\" target=\"_blank\">the sun a souvenir</a>\u00a0(E, 11k) by <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/deletable_bird/pseuds/deletable_bird\" target=\"_blank\">deletable_bird</a>\u00a0- this fic is such a delight! It\u2019s witty and funny and very sincere, Dan is so relatable and so lovable in this story, and his relationship with Louise is just adorable beyond words. Coffee plays a very central part in this story, along with paint and very awkward and lovely flirting. Give this a read, it\u2019s absolutely great!<br/></p><p>2. Vibrator</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16375388\" target=\"_blank\">a ticket of the possibilities</a> (M, 1.4k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWXYyk8MXGyeAjUFbRnOuWg\" target=\"_blank\">@callofthecurlew</a> - an adorable fic about Dan looking at sex toys with Phil back in 2010. It\u2019s just the right balance of funny and sweet and sexy, and has so many little details about their reactions to each other. I just love it so much!</p><p>3. Fic with a secondary pairing</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/12919458\" target=\"_blank\">December 4: purely by coincidence</a> (G, 1.4k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTwDGa4WChcejIPgL-HFfEg\" target=\"_blank\">@alittledizzy</a> - a phimmy AU because honestly we all need it. This fic makes the relationship seem so natural and so obvious, that it takes a minute to realize that it\u2019s not how life turned out to be. There is something so inherently magical about Phil and Jimmy together, and I feel this story captures it perfectly.</p><p>4. Intercrural</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/12245040?show_comments=true&amp;view_full_work=false#comment_215670581\" target=\"_blank\">Connected</a> (M, 3.5k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQxVpu1n0BLwuJmEYdXE5Xg\" target=\"_blank\">@auroraphilealis</a> - a fic about Dan being young, in love and desperate for something they aren\u2019t ready for and Phil being also young, in love and desperate, but feeling the responsibility of keeping his boyfriend safe and satisfied. I really love this fic because it just exudes young desperate love and that fire that a new relationship has. Plus, it\u2019s so beautifully written and so emotional.</p><p>5. Cheating</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16987800\" target=\"_blank\">sweet dreams</a>\u00a0(T, 1.9k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4N0-ju_vq4jNUo_8SIrq-Q\" target=\"_blank\">@waveydnp</a> - there\u2019s no actual cheating in this fic, but I feel it\u2019s still a really good fit for the prompt, because it really dives into what cheating is for different people and how communication in a partnership is important. The depth of this fic is absolutely stunning, and I definitely recommend this story to anyone who hasn\u2019t read it yet.<br/></p><p>6. Soulmates</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16131920\" target=\"_blank\">paint it on your face</a>\u00a0(M, 574) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbGFcBhnacWWC35FxG8CAuQ\" target=\"_blank\">@onedirectionticketss1</a> (<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/whatdoiknowx/pseuds/whatdoiknowx\" target=\"_blank\">whatdoiknowx</a>) - soulmates come in different shapes and sizes. This definitely really encapsulates the whole\u00a0\u201cDan and Phil, best friends and soulmates\u201d in a really really original way. An absolute treat to read, strongly recommend this one!<br/></p><p>7. Warlock/magic au</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14326140\" target=\"_blank\">just once to be lifted strong</a> (T, 26k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcrI4U8qO9vxrnxfSYBY6hQ\" target=\"_blank\">@leblonde</a> - this is one of those fics that I couldn\u2019t possibly describe adequately. If you haven\u2019t read it, you need to do it ASAP. The fantasy elements in it are woven into the story so seamlessly and so gracefully, the characters are both absolutely novel and incredibly in character, and the whole story is just so musical and beautiful that now words can describe it.</p><p>8. ft. Martyn and Cornelia</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14948654\" target=\"_blank\">Let Go Of The Reins</a>\u00a0(T, 81k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOs4-Uo94TbrPMc4l0WvcdQ\" target=\"_blank\">@natigail</a> - there are hundreds of amazing fics featuring Martyn and Cornelia in the phandom, but I really wanted to choose a kind of unexpected fic for this category and landed on this one. This is a horse riding AU, and I think it\u2019s an absolutely stellar example of how meaningful and emotional you can make a relationship between siblings be. The brotherly love that Phil and Martyn share here is deep, real and very difficult and complex, much as it is in real life. The fic really goes deep into both Martyn\u2019s and Cornelia\u2019s character, and it\u2019s just such a pleasure to read.<br/></p><p>9. Songfic insp. by Lana del Rey</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16042958?show_comments=true&amp;view_full_work=false#comment_215668862\" target=\"_blank\">who you are and who you&rsquo;ve been </a>(T, 4.4k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0oqAFYseZ9b_SJTqEcx1jg\" target=\"_blank\">@kay-okays</a> - aaah this fic is just absolutely perfect. I love how the conversation they are having is so so important, but it\u2019s set up to be so lively and real with a little bit of mischief and so much delicate hesitation that you have when you\u2019re in a new relationship that\u2019s just making you so so happy. It\u2019s like Dan kind of doesn\u2019t believe in a way that you can be this happy. I just love it, such a beautiful fic!</p><p>10. Set in 2009</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15710964\" target=\"_blank\">Turn and Face the Strange</a>\u00a0(NR, 2k) by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM-DDvuoN451TdEukdYDn-Q\" target=\"_blank\">@tortitabby</a> - this 2009 fic really focuses on Phil\u2019s relationship with Kath and the overwhelming love she has for her child. It\u2019s very nuanced and very touching, and I really encourage everyone to give it a read, you won\u2019t regret it!<br/></p>",
