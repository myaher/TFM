I felt like I should have said something, but every time I came close, I wimped out. I could see why it took her to get drunk to mention it. It was <i>hard</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was now standing in the beautifully-decorated banquet hall in the hotel, watching as guests filed into their seats in an excited bustle. The wedding was going to start soon and of course my mum only told me now that I was going to be the one walking her down the aisle. It made sense since her parents died a while back, but I never thought about who would take my grandad&rsquo;s place. Apparently it was me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I feel sick,&ldquo; I muttered, clutching my stomach. The sight of more and more people filling the banquet hall made me more and more queasy. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;This is why your mum told you now and not a week ago,&rdquo; Isaac said, trying to see the brighter side of the situation. &ldquo;You would have freaked out and not shown up.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I like that plan a lot better,&ldquo; I said, tearing my eyes away from all of the guests and looking to Isaac. &quot;I&rsquo;m sorry, Isaac, but I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I can do this.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He gave me a heartwarming smile and rested his hands on my shoulders. &ldquo;Y/N. You&rsquo;ve got this. You&rsquo;re going to walk your mother down that aisle and take your place by her side. And you&rsquo;re going to do it without fault. You&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gulped down the lump in my throat and nodded, but I still felt queasy. I was afraid I would vomit right there, on Isaac, in front of everyone.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Look, there&rsquo;s Brie!&ldquo; he announced, nodding behind me, and I could see even <i>he </i>was relieved that I wouldn&rsquo;t throw up. At least not yet anyway. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mum had paid for personal makeup artists and whatnot, so I hadn&rsquo;t seen Brie since we were pulled apart to get ready this afternoon. I turned around and saw Brie approaching me, a small smile on her lips. I momentarily forgot about the noisy guests and my queasy stomach, instead distracted by the pretty blonde in a black suit that fit her ever so perfectly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey,&rdquo; she said, grabbing my hands and squeezing them gently, her eyes meeting mine, a hint of concern in them. &ldquo;Your mum told me about the whole walking her down the aisle thing. You okay?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I opened my mouth to respond, but I was literally speechless at how beautiful she looked. Her hair was pulled half back and her makeup was light but brought out the gold flecks in her brown eyes. She was absolutely stunning, and I tried not to drool there and then. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes glanced behind me and I could only imagine what Isaac was mouthing to her. Brie&rsquo;s eyebrows creased as she nodded slowly, before looking back to me with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You doing good, Y/N?&ldquo; she asked again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I found my words. &quot;Erm, not really.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded and she let go of one of my hands, the other leading me on a walk out of there. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be absolutely fine up there. Your mum asked you to walk her down the aisle because you mean the world to her. She knows you&rsquo;ve got this, as do I.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to screw up,&ldquo; I said, the queasiness subsiding a little, with each word Brie spoke in her soft, comforting voice. &quot;There&rsquo;s <i>so </i>many people out there, Brie.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie chuckled. &ldquo;I know. Audiences aren&rsquo;t my best friend either.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I realised she knew exactly how I felt. She was the biggest introvert I knew and yet she&rsquo;d pushed herself to get out there, whether that be for press tours for her films or for&hellip; well, for me, like for this whole week. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We stopped outside of a set of double doors, leading to my mum&rsquo;s dressing room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t think about anything, just do it,&ldquo; she said, a reassuring smile on her face. &quot;If you think, you <i>overthink</i> and that&rsquo;s never good. Get down the aisle and stand by your mum at the altar. After that, you can look out into the seats and you&rsquo;ll see me grinning up at you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed at her knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m not kidding,&ldquo; she told me with a chuckle. &quot;Seriously, Y/N. I&rsquo;m there if you need me. It will be over before you know it, okay? You got this.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out slowly, nodding my head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You feel a bit better? Because I should go take my seat,&ldquo; she said, a little reluctantly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, smiling at her and squeezing her hand that was still grasping mine. &quot;Thank you, Brie.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from leaning forward and pressing a kiss to her cheek. &ldquo;You look really beautiful,&rdquo; I told her honestly, finding the blush on her cheeks adorable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I, erm, er&hellip;&ldquo; she stumbled, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but grin, but suddenly her eyes widened. &quot;Wait a minute. Last night, I-&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she was cut off when the dressing room doors opened and out walked my mother, dressed in her wedding gown and ready to go. When she spotted me, she smiled. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N, are you ready?&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was going to respond, but I looked back to Brie, seeing some kind of recognition flash across her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Brie, what about last night?&rdquo; \u00a0I asked, growing nervous. Did she remember?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie licked her lips and was about to reply, but once again, she was interrupted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What are you all still doing out here?! Everybody is waiting! The bridesmaids are walking down the aisle as we speak!&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I turned and saw the wedding planner my mum hired, approaching us with a clipboard and wild eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Sweetie, you need to the your seat,&rdquo; she continued, already dragging Brie away and leading her to the banquet hall. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I followed her with my eyes, seeing her glance back, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell what she was thinking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Come on, Y/N, we must go,&ldquo; my mum said, grabbing my attention. &quot;Thank you for doing this. And you look wonderful.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, putting any thoughts of Brie and I to the back of my mind. I smiled a little, grabbing my mum&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Thank you, mum. You look amazing.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thank you, dear,&ldquo; she said appreciatively. &quot;You ready?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sucked up a deep breath. &ldquo;I think so&hellip; You nervous?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head confidently. &ldquo;Absolutely not. This is exactly what I want. It&rsquo;s been a long time coming.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, envying her fearlessness. The two of us eventually stopped by the doors that led into the banquet hall. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You sure you&rsquo;re ready?&ldquo; she asked, facing me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, doing what Brie told me. Not even thinking about it. &quot;I got this. Let&rsquo;s get you married, mum.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and we linked arms before I pushed the doors open. I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it as I kept putting one foot in front of the other, leading my mum down the aisle. The orchestra were playing an instrumental ballad Isaac and my mum had chosen together, and I could see Isaac ahead of us, tearing up at the sight of my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ignored the many eyes of our guests as we neared Isaac, but I would be lying if I said it didn&rsquo;t make my stomach do backflips, and not the good kind. Finally, we reached the altar and the music stopped, the hall going eerily quiet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thank you, Y/N,&ldquo; my mum whispered before I let her go, standing before her husband-to-be, who gave me a supportive thumbs up for not throwing up. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled at them before taking my position as the maid of honour, stood to my mum&rsquo;s side and in front of the whole room. The wedding officiant began the ceremony and I found my eyes drifting to the guests. I remembered most of them - though not by name - from the rounds I&rsquo;d been making all week. My eyes finally settled on the person I was looking for - Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was sat in the front row, eyes focused on my mum and Isaac. I thought back to what she was going to say earlier - did she remember what happened last night? I wasn&rsquo;t sure, but I hoped she did. If she spoke up about it, I might finally have the guts to say something to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes drifted to mine and I saw her cheeks turn pink, but she gave me a small smile, nodding my way. I found myself smiling back, feeling my heart beat faster and faster. I had to tell her how I felt. I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the way she made me feel. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the ceremony ended quite beautifully, everybody was led to the reception, which was being held outside by the beach. I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible to outdo the wedding itself, but I was wrong. It was amazing and the food was even better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie and I were constantly surrounded by guests, so we didn&rsquo;t get the chance to speak properly about what she wanted to tell me, which was slowly killing me, but I tried my best to be patient. Eventually, after everyone had eaten and the speeches had been made (which I almost peed my pants at, not going to lie), everybody was free to do whatever, so I found myself looking for Brie, who had been dragged away by some guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I eventually found her by the bar, downing a drink. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey,&rdquo; I said, making my presence known. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She left the glass on the bar and turned to face me, a small smile on her lips. &ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, trying to figure out what to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I never said how great you looked in your dress,&ldquo; she spoke first, before smiling teasingly. &quot;Never thought I would live to see the day.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glared at her playfully. &ldquo;Gee, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and then it went quiet between us. I sucked up a deep breath, knowing I wanted to tell her. Whether she was going to tell me or not. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I-&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Do you want to dance?&rdquo; Brie asked before I could get any words out. &ldquo;I mean, we may as well blow everyone away with our amazing newly-developed skills.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I saw her smiling, but I could see the nerves in her fumbling hands and reluctancy to make a further move. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah, let&rsquo;s dance,&ldquo; I agreed, giving her a reassuring smile, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure why she felt that way. If anything, <i>I </i>was the one trying to talk myself up to tell her the truth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grabbed her hand, ignoring the accompanied tingling feeling I felt whenever I touched her, and led her to the dance floor where many couples and families were swaying to the slow, but rhythmic music. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;After you, m'lady,&rdquo; I joked, letting her step forward first. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile and went first before I followed after, resting a hand in hers and the other on her back, as I was taught. She rested her other hand on my waist and I hoped my face wasn&rsquo;t as red as it felt. She met my eyes, her height towering over me a little bit because of her heels, and I found myself mesmerised.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We both swayed to the music and I managed not to step on her toes which was good. Maybe the dance lessons paid off&hellip;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay, look, I remember what I said last night,&ldquo; Brie blurted, stopping dancing. She avoided my eyes and let go of me, pinching the bridge of her nose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You do?&rdquo; \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded before meeting my eyes with terrified ones. &ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to make things weird or anything.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chewed on my lip. &ldquo;But you meant it?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked confused. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grew hopeful. &ldquo;Did you mean what you said?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked like she wanted to say no and lie to me, but I held her gaze, urging her to tell me the truth. Finally, she sighed and nodded. &ldquo;I meant it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt relief spread through me. &ldquo;You meant it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pursed her lips, still confused and also nervous. My eyes flickered to her lips and I really wanted to lean forward and kiss her. And not like last time where it was rushed and forced, but properly, where I could fully appreciate it. Appreciate her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You asked me what I would have said if you had asked me out,&ldquo; I said, still distracted by her lips. I stepped a little closer to her, sensing her nervousness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N it&rsquo;s okay if-&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I met her eyes. &ldquo;I would have said yes.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raised her eyebrows, eyes widening a little. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself now, feeling a knot of butterflies in my stomach stuck there since last night. I rested my hand on her cheek before closing the gap between us and pressing my lips to hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn&rsquo;t take long for her to return the kiss, moving her lips against mine in perfect sync. Her hand gripped my waist as she moved forward, our bodies melding together like the final pieces of a puzzle. My insides exploded like fireworks and I hadn&rsquo;t realised how badly I had wanted to kiss her until now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pulled away, breathlessly, but I chased her lips down and reconnected them with mine, still not over the sensational feeling. Eventually, I pulled away, catching my breath and meeting her coffee-coloured eyes. She was breathtaking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Ask me,&ldquo; I muttered, caressing her cheek with my thumb. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was nervous, her breath hitching slightly. &quot;Ask you what?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rested my other hand on top of hers, the one resting on my waist. &ldquo;Ask me out.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A smile fell upon her lips as she shook her head. &ldquo;Y/N-&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Go on,&ldquo; I said, mirroring her smile and nodding encouragingly. &quot;You wanted to ask me out. So, ask.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She searched my eyes for a hint of playfulness, but I was very much serious. Finally, she grabbed my hands and held onto them, eyes set on mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay, well, Y/N.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yes?&rdquo; I asked, quirking an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile, her eyes lighting up. &ldquo;Will you, erm, will you&hellip; oh, god&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Why are you so hesitant?&ldquo; I asked her, staring at her with a disbelieving smile. &quot;We literally just made out and you&rsquo;re <i>still </i>having doubts?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, letting go of one of my hands so she could massage her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; this is stupid.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No it&rsquo;s not,&ldquo; I assured her, looking lower so she could meet my eyes. &quot;It&rsquo;s not stupid. It&rsquo;s important. And I don&rsquo;t want you to be scared. I have feelings for you, Brie. And you&rsquo;re not the only one who regrets not saying something about it. But I&rsquo;m saying something now.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised our intertwined fingers and kissed her knuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Will you go out with me, Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers?&ldquo; I asked hopefully. &quot;On a proper date?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie&rsquo;s lips curled into a smile and she nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. &ldquo;When we get back, I&rsquo;m going to plan something. We&rsquo;re going to do this properly.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed, nodding in agreement. &ldquo;Yes, we will.&rdquo; She pulled me closer and met my eyes. &ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My heart warmed at how nervous she was still. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You don&rsquo;t even need to ask,&ldquo; I told her, before leaning forward and kissing her again. This one was short, but it said everything we wanted it to. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We finally had each other. </p>",

It was <i>hard</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was now standing in the beautifully-decorated banquet hall in the hotel, watching as guests filed into their seats in an excited bustle. The wedding was going to start soon and of course my mum only told me now that I was going to be the one walking her down the aisle. It made sense since her parents died a while back, but I never thought about who would take my grandad\u2019s place. Apparently it was me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I feel sick,\u201c I muttered, clutching my stomach. The sight of more and more people filling the banquet hall made me more and more queasy. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is why your mum told you now and not a week ago,\u201d Isaac said, trying to see the brighter side of the situation. \u201cYou would have freaked out and not shown up.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I like that plan a lot better,\u201c I said, tearing my eyes away from all of the guests and looking to Isaac. \"I\u2019m sorry, Isaac, but I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can do this.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He gave me a heartwarming smile and rested his hands on my shoulders. \u201cY/N. You\u2019ve got this. You\u2019re going to walk your mother down that aisle and take your place by her side. And you\u2019re going to do it without fault. You\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gulped down the lump in my throat and nodded, but I still felt queasy. I was afraid I would vomit right there, on Isaac, in front of everyone.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, there\u2019s Brie!\u201c he announced, nodding behind me, and I could see even <i>he </i>was relieved that I wouldn\u2019t throw up. At least not yet anyway. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mum had paid for personal makeup artists and whatnot, so I hadn\u2019t seen Brie since we were pulled apart to get ready this afternoon. I turned around and saw Brie approaching me, a small smile on her lips. I momentarily forgot about the noisy guests and my queasy stomach, instead distracted by the pretty blonde in a black suit that fit her ever so perfectly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d she said, grabbing my hands and squeezing them gently, her eyes meeting mine, a hint of concern in them. \u201cYour mum told me about the whole walking her down the aisle thing. You okay?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I opened my mouth to respond, but I was literally speechless at how beautiful she looked. Her hair was pulled half back and her makeup was light but brought out the gold flecks in her brown eyes. She was absolutely stunning, and I tried not to drool there and then. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes glanced behind me and I could only imagine what Isaac was mouthing to her. Brie\u2019s eyebrows creased as she nodded slowly, before looking back to me with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You doing good, Y/N?\u201c she asked again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I found my words. \"Erm, not really.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded and she let go of one of my hands, the other leading me on a walk out of there. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be absolutely fine up there. Your mum asked you to walk her down the aisle because you mean the world to her. She knows you\u2019ve got this, as do I.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to screw up,\u201c I said, the queasiness subsiding a little, with each word Brie spoke in her soft, comforting voice. \"There\u2019s <i>so </i>many people out there, Brie.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie chuckled. \u201cI know. Audiences aren\u2019t my best friend either.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I realised she knew exactly how I felt. She was the biggest introvert I knew and yet she\u2019d pushed herself to get out there, whether that be for press tours for her films or for\u2026 well, for me, like for this whole week. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We stopped outside of a set of double doors, leading to my mum\u2019s dressing room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don\u2019t think about anything, just do it,\u201c she said, a reassuring smile on her face. \"If you think, you <i>overthink</i> and that\u2019s never good. Get down the aisle and stand by your mum at the altar. After that, you can look out into the seats and you\u2019ll see me grinning up at you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed at her knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m not kidding,\u201c she told me with a chuckle. \"Seriously, Y/N. I\u2019m there if you need me. It will be over before you know it, okay? You got this.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out slowly, nodding my head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You feel a bit better? Because I should go take my seat,\u201c she said, a little reluctantly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, smiling at her and squeezing her hand that was still grasping mine. \"Thank you, Brie.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop myself from leaning forward and pressing a kiss to her cheek. \u201cYou look really beautiful,\u201d I told her honestly, finding the blush on her cheeks adorable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I, erm, er\u2026\u201c she stumbled, and I couldn\u2019t help but grin, but suddenly her eyes widened. \"Wait a minute. Last night, I-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she was cut off when the dressing room doors opened and out walked my mother, dressed in her wedding gown and ready to go. When she spotted me, she smiled. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N, are you ready?\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was going to respond, but I looked back to Brie, seeing some kind of recognition flash across her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, what about last night?\u201d \u00a0I asked, growing nervous. Did she remember?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie licked her lips and was about to reply, but once again, she was interrupted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you all still doing out here?! Everybody is waiting! The bridesmaids are walking down the aisle as we speak!\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I turned and saw the wedding planner my mum hired, approaching us with a clipboard and wild eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sweetie, you need to the your seat,\u201d she continued, already dragging Brie away and leading her to the banquet hall. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I followed her with my eyes, seeing her glance back, but I couldn\u2019t tell what she was thinking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, Y/N, we must go,\u201c my mum said, grabbing my attention. \"Thank you for doing this. And you look wonderful.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, putting any thoughts of Brie and I to the back of my mind. I smiled a little, grabbing my mum\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, mum. You look amazing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, dear,\u201c she said appreciatively. \"You ready?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sucked up a deep breath. \u201cI think so\u2026 You nervous?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head confidently. \u201cAbsolutely not. This is exactly what I want. It\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, envying her fearlessness. The two of us eventually stopped by the doors that led into the banquet hall. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure you\u2019re ready?\u201c she asked, facing me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, doing what Brie told me. Not even thinking about it. \"I got this. Let\u2019s get you married, mum.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and we linked arms before I pushed the doors open. I didn\u2019t think anything of it as I kept putting one foot in front of the other, leading my mum down the aisle. The orchestra were playing an instrumental ballad Isaac and my mum had chosen together, and I could see Isaac ahead of us, tearing up at the sight of my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ignored the many eyes of our guests as we neared Isaac, but I would be lying if I said it didn\u2019t make my stomach do backflips, and not the good kind. Finally, we reached the altar and the music stopped, the hall going eerily quiet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, Y/N,\u201c my mum whispered before I let her go, standing before her husband-to-be, who gave me a supportive thumbs up for not throwing up. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled at them before taking my position as the maid of honour, stood to my mum\u2019s side and in front of the whole room. The wedding officiant began the ceremony and I found my eyes drifting to the guests. I remembered most of them - though not by name - from the rounds I\u2019d been making all week. My eyes finally settled on the person I was looking for - Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was sat in the front row, eyes focused on my mum and Isaac. I thought back to what she was going to say earlier - did she remember what happened last night? I wasn\u2019t sure, but I hoped she did. If she spoke up about it, I might finally have the guts to say something to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes drifted to mine and I saw her cheeks turn pink, but she gave me a small smile, nodding my way. I found myself smiling back, feeling my heart beat faster and faster. I had to tell her how I felt. I couldn\u2019t ignore the way she made me feel. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the ceremony ended quite beautifully, everybody was led to the reception, which was being held outside by the beach. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to outdo the wedding itself, but I was wrong. It was amazing and the food was even better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie and I were constantly surrounded by guests, so we didn\u2019t get the chance to speak properly about what she wanted to tell me, which was slowly killing me, but I tried my best to be patient. Eventually, after everyone had eaten and the speeches had been made (which I almost peed my pants at, not going to lie), everybody was free to do whatever, so I found myself looking for Brie, who had been dragged away by some guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I eventually found her by the bar, downing a drink. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d I said, making my presence known. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She left the glass on the bar and turned to face me, a small smile on her lips. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, trying to figure out what to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I never said how great you looked in your dress,\u201c she spoke first, before smiling teasingly. \"Never thought I would live to see the day.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glared at her playfully. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and then it went quiet between us. I sucked up a deep breath, knowing I wanted to tell her. Whether she was going to tell me or not. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you want to dance?\u201d Brie asked before I could get any words out. \u201cI mean, we may as well blow everyone away with our amazing newly-developed skills.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I saw her smiling, but I could see the nerves in her fumbling hands and reluctancy to make a further move. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, let\u2019s dance,\u201c I agreed, giving her a reassuring smile, though I wasn\u2019t sure why she felt that way. If anything, <i>I </i>was the one trying to talk myself up to tell her the truth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grabbed her hand, ignoring the accompanied tingling feeling I felt whenever I touched her, and led her to the dance floor where many couples and families were swaying to the slow, but rhythmic music. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"After you, m'lady,\u201d I joked, letting her step forward first. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile and went first before I followed after, resting a hand in hers and the other on her back, as I was taught. She rested her other hand on my waist and I hoped my face wasn\u2019t as red as it felt. She met my eyes, her height towering over me a little bit because of her heels, and I found myself mesmerised.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We both swayed to the music and I managed not to step on her toes which was good. Maybe the dance lessons paid off\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, look, I remember what I said last night,\u201c Brie blurted, stopping dancing. She avoided my eyes and let go of me, pinching the bridge of her nose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You do?\u201d \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded before meeting my eyes with terrified ones. \u201cY/N, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make things weird or anything.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chewed on my lip. \u201cBut you meant it?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grew hopeful. \u201cDid you mean what you said?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked like she wanted to say no and lie to me, but I held her gaze, urging her to tell me the truth. Finally, she sighed and nodded. \u201cI meant it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt relief spread through me. \u201cYou meant it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pursed her lips, still confused and also nervous. My eyes flickered to her lips and I really wanted to lean forward and kiss her. And not like last time where it was rushed and forced, but properly, where I could fully appreciate it. Appreciate her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You asked me what I would have said if you had asked me out,\u201c I said, still distracted by her lips. I stepped a little closer to her, sensing her nervousness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N it\u2019s okay if-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I met her eyes. \u201cI would have said yes.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raised her eyebrows, eyes widening a little. I couldn\u2019t help myself now, feeling a knot of butterflies in my stomach stuck there since last night. I rested my hand on her cheek before closing the gap between us and pressing my lips to hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn\u2019t take long for her to return the kiss, moving her lips against mine in perfect sync. Her hand gripped my waist as she moved forward, our bodies melding together like the final pieces of a puzzle. My insides exploded like fireworks and I hadn\u2019t realised how badly I had wanted to kiss her until now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pulled away, breathlessly, but I chased her lips down and reconnected them with mine, still not over the sensational feeling. Eventually, I pulled away, catching my breath and meeting her coffee-coloured eyes. She was breathtaking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ask me,\u201c I muttered, caressing her cheek with my thumb. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was nervous, her breath hitching slightly. \"Ask you what?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rested my other hand on top of hers, the one resting on my waist. \u201cAsk me out.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A smile fell upon her lips as she shook her head. \u201cY/N-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on,\u201c I said, mirroring her smile and nodding encouragingly. \"You wanted to ask me out. So, ask.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She searched my eyes for a hint of playfulness, but I was very much serious. Finally, she grabbed my hands and held onto them, eyes set on mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, well, Y/N.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes?\u201d I asked, quirking an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile, her eyes lighting up. \u201cWill you, erm, will you\u2026 oh, god\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why are you so hesitant?\u201c I asked her, staring at her with a disbelieving smile. \"We literally just made out and you\u2019re <i>still </i>having doubts?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, letting go of one of my hands so she could massage her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 this is stupid.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No it\u2019s not,\u201c I assured her, looking lower so she could meet my eyes. \"It\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s important. And I don\u2019t want you to be scared. I have feelings for you, Brie. And you\u2019re not the only one who regrets not saying something about it. But I\u2019m saying something now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised our intertwined fingers and kissed her knuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will you go out with me, Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers?\u201c I asked hopefully. \"On a proper date?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie\u2019s lips curled into a smile and she nodded. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. \u201cWhen we get back, I\u2019m going to plan something. We\u2019re going to do this properly.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed, nodding in agreement. \u201cYes, we will.\u201d She pulled me closer and met my eyes. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My heart warmed at how nervous she was still. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don\u2019t even need to ask,\u201c I told her, before leaning forward and kissing her again. This one was short, but it said everything we wanted it to. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We finally had each other. </p>",

I felt like I should have said something, but every time I came close, I wimped out. I could see why it took her to get drunk to mention it. It was <i>hard</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was now standing in the beautifully-decorated banquet hall in the hotel, watching as guests filed into their seats in an excited bustle. The wedding was going to start soon and of course my mum only told me now that I was going to be the one walking her down the aisle. It made sense since her parents died a while back, but I never thought about who would take my grandad\u2019s place. Apparently it was me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I feel sick,\u201c I muttered, clutching my stomach. The sight of more and more people filling the banquet hall made me more and more queasy. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is why your mum told you now and not a week ago,\u201d Isaac said, trying to see the brighter side of the situation. \u201cYou would have freaked out and not shown up.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I like that plan a lot better,\u201c I said, tearing my eyes away from all of the guests and looking to Isaac. \"I\u2019m sorry, Isaac, but I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can do this.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He gave me a heartwarming smile and rested his hands on my shoulders. \u201cY/N. You\u2019ve got this. You\u2019re going to walk your mother down that aisle and take your place by her side. And you\u2019re going to do it without fault. You\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gulped down the lump in my throat and nodded, but I still felt queasy. I was afraid I would vomit right there, on Isaac, in front of everyone.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, there\u2019s Brie!\u201c he announced, nodding behind me, and I could see even <i>he </i>was relieved that I wouldn\u2019t throw up. At least not yet anyway. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My mum had paid for personal makeup artists and whatnot, so I hadn\u2019t seen Brie since we were pulled apart to get ready this afternoon. I turned around and saw Brie approaching me, a small smile on her lips. I momentarily forgot about the noisy guests and my queasy stomach, instead distracted by the pretty blonde in a black suit that fit her ever so perfectly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d she said, grabbing my hands and squeezing them gently, her eyes meeting mine, a hint of concern in them. \u201cYour mum told me about the whole walking her down the aisle thing. You okay?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I opened my mouth to respond, but I was literally speechless at how beautiful she looked. Her hair was pulled half back and her makeup was light but brought out the gold flecks in her brown eyes. She was absolutely stunning, and I tried not to drool there and then. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes glanced behind me and I could only imagine what Isaac was mouthing to her. Brie\u2019s eyebrows creased as she nodded slowly, before looking back to me with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You doing good, Y/N?\u201c she asked again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I found my words. \"Erm, not really.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded and she let go of one of my hands, the other leading me on a walk out of there. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be absolutely fine up there. Your mum asked you to walk her down the aisle because you mean the world to her. She knows you\u2019ve got this, as do I.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don\u2019t want to screw up,\u201c I said, the queasiness subsiding a little, with each word Brie spoke in her soft, comforting voice. \"There\u2019s <i>so </i>many people out there, Brie.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie chuckled. \u201cI know. Audiences aren\u2019t my best friend either.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I realised she knew exactly how I felt. She was the biggest introvert I knew and yet she\u2019d pushed herself to get out there, whether that be for press tours for her films or for\u2026 well, for me, like for this whole week. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We stopped outside of a set of double doors, leading to my mum\u2019s dressing room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don\u2019t think about anything, just do it,\u201c she said, a reassuring smile on her face. \"If you think, you <i>overthink</i> and that\u2019s never good. Get down the aisle and stand by your mum at the altar. After that, you can look out into the seats and you\u2019ll see me grinning up at you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed at her knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m not kidding,\u201c she told me with a chuckle. \"Seriously, Y/N. I\u2019m there if you need me. It will be over before you know it, okay? You got this.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out slowly, nodding my head. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You feel a bit better? Because I should go take my seat,\u201c she said, a little reluctantly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, smiling at her and squeezing her hand that was still grasping mine. \"Thank you, Brie.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop myself from leaning forward and pressing a kiss to her cheek. \u201cYou look really beautiful,\u201d I told her honestly, finding the blush on her cheeks adorable. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I, erm, er\u2026\u201c she stumbled, and I couldn\u2019t help but grin, but suddenly her eyes widened. \"Wait a minute. Last night, I-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she was cut off when the dressing room doors opened and out walked my mother, dressed in her wedding gown and ready to go. When she spotted me, she smiled. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N, are you ready?\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was going to respond, but I looked back to Brie, seeing some kind of recognition flash across her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Brie, what about last night?\u201d \u00a0I asked, growing nervous. Did she remember?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie licked her lips and was about to reply, but once again, she was interrupted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you all still doing out here?! Everybody is waiting! The bridesmaids are walking down the aisle as we speak!\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I turned and saw the wedding planner my mum hired, approaching us with a clipboard and wild eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sweetie, you need to the your seat,\u201d she continued, already dragging Brie away and leading her to the banquet hall. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I followed her with my eyes, seeing her glance back, but I couldn\u2019t tell what she was thinking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on, Y/N, we must go,\u201c my mum said, grabbing my attention. \"Thank you for doing this. And you look wonderful.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, putting any thoughts of Brie and I to the back of my mind. I smiled a little, grabbing my mum\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, mum. You look amazing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, dear,\u201c she said appreciatively. \"You ready?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sucked up a deep breath. \u201cI think so\u2026 You nervous?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head confidently. \u201cAbsolutely not. This is exactly what I want. It\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded, envying her fearlessness. The two of us eventually stopped by the doors that led into the banquet hall. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure you\u2019re ready?\u201c she asked, facing me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I breathed out, doing what Brie told me. Not even thinking about it. \"I got this. Let\u2019s get you married, mum.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned and we linked arms before I pushed the doors open. I didn\u2019t think anything of it as I kept putting one foot in front of the other, leading my mum down the aisle. The orchestra were playing an instrumental ballad Isaac and my mum had chosen together, and I could see Isaac ahead of us, tearing up at the sight of my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ignored the many eyes of our guests as we neared Isaac, but I would be lying if I said it didn\u2019t make my stomach do backflips, and not the good kind. Finally, we reached the altar and the music stopped, the hall going eerily quiet. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, Y/N,\u201c my mum whispered before I let her go, standing before her husband-to-be, who gave me a supportive thumbs up for not throwing up. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled at them before taking my position as the maid of honour, stood to my mum\u2019s side and in front of the whole room. The wedding officiant began the ceremony and I found my eyes drifting to the guests. I remembered most of them - though not by name - from the rounds I\u2019d been making all week. My eyes finally settled on the person I was looking for - Brie. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was sat in the front row, eyes focused on my mum and Isaac. I thought back to what she was going to say earlier - did she remember what happened last night? I wasn\u2019t sure, but I hoped she did. If she spoke up about it, I might finally have the guts to say something to her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes drifted to mine and I saw her cheeks turn pink, but she gave me a small smile, nodding my way. I found myself smiling back, feeling my heart beat faster and faster. I had to tell her how I felt. I couldn\u2019t ignore the way she made me feel. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After the ceremony ended quite beautifully, everybody was led to the reception, which was being held outside by the beach. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to outdo the wedding itself, but I was wrong. It was amazing and the food was even better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie and I were constantly surrounded by guests, so we didn\u2019t get the chance to speak properly about what she wanted to tell me, which was slowly killing me, but I tried my best to be patient. Eventually, after everyone had eaten and the speeches had been made (which I almost peed my pants at, not going to lie), everybody was free to do whatever, so I found myself looking for Brie, who had been dragged away by some guests. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I eventually found her by the bar, downing a drink. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d I said, making my presence known. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She left the glass on the bar and turned to face me, a small smile on her lips. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pursed my lips, trying to figure out what to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I never said how great you looked in your dress,\u201c she spoke first, before smiling teasingly. \"Never thought I would live to see the day.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I glared at her playfully. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed and then it went quiet between us. I sucked up a deep breath, knowing I wanted to tell her. Whether she was going to tell me or not. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you want to dance?\u201d Brie asked before I could get any words out. \u201cI mean, we may as well blow everyone away with our amazing newly-developed skills.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I saw her smiling, but I could see the nerves in her fumbling hands and reluctancy to make a further move. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, let\u2019s dance,\u201c I agreed, giving her a reassuring smile, though I wasn\u2019t sure why she felt that way. If anything, <i>I </i>was the one trying to talk myself up to tell her the truth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grabbed her hand, ignoring the accompanied tingling feeling I felt whenever I touched her, and led her to the dance floor where many couples and families were swaying to the slow, but rhythmic music. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"After you, m'lady,\u201d I joked, letting her step forward first. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile and went first before I followed after, resting a hand in hers and the other on her back, as I was taught. She rested her other hand on my waist and I hoped my face wasn\u2019t as red as it felt. She met my eyes, her height towering over me a little bit because of her heels, and I found myself mesmerised.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We both swayed to the music and I managed not to step on her toes which was good. Maybe the dance lessons paid off\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, look, I remember what I said last night,\u201c Brie blurted, stopping dancing. She avoided my eyes and let go of me, pinching the bridge of her nose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You do?\u201d \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded before meeting my eyes with terrified ones. \u201cY/N, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make things weird or anything.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chewed on my lip. \u201cBut you meant it?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grew hopeful. \u201cDid you mean what you said?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She looked like she wanted to say no and lie to me, but I held her gaze, urging her to tell me the truth. Finally, she sighed and nodded. \u201cI meant it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I felt relief spread through me. \u201cYou meant it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pursed her lips, still confused and also nervous. My eyes flickered to her lips and I really wanted to lean forward and kiss her. And not like last time where it was rushed and forced, but properly, where I could fully appreciate it. Appreciate her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You asked me what I would have said if you had asked me out,\u201c I said, still distracted by her lips. I stepped a little closer to her, sensing her nervousness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N it\u2019s okay if-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I met her eyes. \u201cI would have said yes.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raised her eyebrows, eyes widening a little. I couldn\u2019t help myself now, feeling a knot of butterflies in my stomach stuck there since last night. I rested my hand on her cheek before closing the gap between us and pressing my lips to hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn\u2019t take long for her to return the kiss, moving her lips against mine in perfect sync. Her hand gripped my waist as she moved forward, our bodies melding together like the final pieces of a puzzle. My insides exploded like fireworks and I hadn\u2019t realised how badly I had wanted to kiss her until now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pulled away, breathlessly, but I chased her lips down and reconnected them with mine, still not over the sensational feeling. Eventually, I pulled away, catching my breath and meeting her coffee-coloured eyes. She was breathtaking. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ask me,\u201c I muttered, caressing her cheek with my thumb. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was nervous, her breath hitching slightly. \"Ask you what?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rested my other hand on top of hers, the one resting on my waist. \u201cAsk me out.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A smile fell upon her lips as she shook her head. \u201cY/N-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Go on,\u201c I said, mirroring her smile and nodding encouragingly. \"You wanted to ask me out. So, ask.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She searched my eyes for a hint of playfulness, but I was very much serious. Finally, she grabbed my hands and held onto them, eyes set on mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, well, Y/N.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes?\u201d I asked, quirking an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She suppressed a smile, her eyes lighting up. \u201cWill you, erm, will you\u2026 oh, god\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why are you so hesitant?\u201c I asked her, staring at her with a disbelieving smile. \"We literally just made out and you\u2019re <i>still </i>having doubts?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, letting go of one of my hands so she could massage her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 this is stupid.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No it\u2019s not,\u201c I assured her, looking lower so she could meet my eyes. \"It\u2019s not stupid. It\u2019s important. And I don\u2019t want you to be scared. I have feelings for you, Brie. And you\u2019re not the only one who regrets not saying something about it. But I\u2019m saying something now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I raised our intertwined fingers and kissed her knuckle. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will you go out with me, Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers?\u201c I asked hopefully. \"On a proper date?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Brie\u2019s lips curled into a smile and she nodded. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I grinned. \u201cWhen we get back, I\u2019m going to plan something. We\u2019re going to do this properly.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She laughed, nodding in agreement. \u201cYes, we will.\u201d She pulled me closer and met my eyes. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My heart warmed at how nervous she was still. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don\u2019t even need to ask,\u201c I told her, before leaning forward and kissing her again. This one was short, but it said everything we wanted it to. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We finally had each other. </p>",

I felt like I should have said something, but every time I came close, I wimped out. I could see why it took her to get drunk to mention it. It was <i>hard</i>. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was now standing in the beautifully-decorated banquet hall in the hotel, watching as guests filed into their seats in an excited bustle. The wedding was going to start soon and of course my mum only told me now that I was going to be the one walking her down the aisle. It made sense since her parents died a while back, but I never thought about who would take my grandad&rsquo;s place. Apparently it was me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I feel sick,&ldquo; I muttered, clutching my stomach. The sight of more and more people filling the banquet hall made me more and more queasy. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"This is why your mum told you now and not a week ago,&rdquo; Isaac said, trying to see the brighter side of the situation. &ldquo;You would have freaked out and not shown up.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I like that plan a lot better,&ldquo; I said, tearing my eyes away from all of the guests and looking to Isaac. \"I&rsquo;m sorry, Isaac, but I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I can do this.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave me a heartwarming smile and rested his hands on my shoulders. &ldquo;Y/N. You&rsquo;ve got this. You&rsquo;re going to walk your mother down that aisle and take your place by her side. And you&rsquo;re going to do it without fault. You&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gulped down the lump in my throat and nodded, but I still felt queasy. I was afraid I would vomit right there, on Isaac, in front of everyone.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Look, there&rsquo;s Brie!&ldquo; he announced, nodding behind me, and I could see even <i>he </i>was relieved that I wouldn&rsquo;t throw up. At least not yet anyway. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mum had paid for personal makeup artists and whatnot, so I hadn&rsquo;t seen Brie since we were pulled apart to get ready this afternoon. I turned around and saw Brie approaching me, a small smile on her lips. I momentarily forgot about the noisy guests and my queasy stomach, instead distracted by the pretty blonde in a black suit that fit her ever so perfectly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&rdquo; she said, grabbing my hands and squeezing them gently, her eyes meeting mine, a hint of concern in them. &ldquo;Your mum told me about the whole walking her down the aisle thing. You okay?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I opened my mouth to respond, but I was literally speechless at how beautiful she looked. Her hair was pulled half back and her makeup was light but brought out the gold flecks in her brown eyes. She was absolutely stunning, and I tried not to drool there and then. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes glanced behind me and I could only imagine what Isaac was mouthing to her. Brie&rsquo;s eyebrows creased as she nodded slowly, before looking back to me with a smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You doing good, Y/N?&ldquo; she asked again. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, I found my words. \"Erm, not really.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded and she let go of one of my hands, the other leading me on a walk out of there. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be absolutely fine up there. Your mum asked you to walk her down the aisle because you mean the world to her. She knows you&rsquo;ve got this, as do I.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I don&rsquo;t want to screw up,&ldquo; I said, the queasiness subsiding a little, with each word Brie spoke in her soft, comforting voice. \"There&rsquo;s <i>so </i>many people out there, Brie.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie chuckled. &ldquo;I know. Audiences aren&rsquo;t my best friend either.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I realised she knew exactly how I felt. She was the biggest introvert I knew and yet she&rsquo;d pushed herself to get out there, whether that be for press tours for her films or for&hellip; well, for me, like for this whole week. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We stopped outside of a set of double doors, leading to my mum&rsquo;s dressing room. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Don&rsquo;t think about anything, just do it,&ldquo; she said, a reassuring smile on her face. \"If you think, you <i>overthink</i> and that&rsquo;s never good. Get down the aisle and stand by your mum at the altar. After that, you can look out into the seats and you&rsquo;ll see me grinning up at you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed at her knowing look. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m not kidding,&ldquo; she told me with a chuckle. \"Seriously, Y/N. I&rsquo;m there if you need me. It will be over before you know it, okay? You got this.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I breathed out slowly, nodding my head. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You feel a bit better? Because I should go take my seat,&ldquo; she said, a little reluctantly.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded, smiling at her and squeezing her hand that was still grasping mine. \"Thank you, Brie.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from leaning forward and pressing a kiss to her cheek. &ldquo;You look really beautiful,&rdquo; I told her honestly, finding the blush on her cheeks adorable. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I, erm, er&hellip;&ldquo; she stumbled, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but grin, but suddenly her eyes widened. \"Wait a minute. Last night, I-&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she was cut off when the dressing room doors opened and out walked my mother, dressed in her wedding gown and ready to go. When she spotted me, she smiled. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N, are you ready?&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was going to respond, but I looked back to Brie, seeing some kind of recognition flash across her face. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Brie, what about last night?&rdquo; &nbsp;I asked, growing nervous. Did she remember?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie licked her lips and was about to reply, but once again, she was interrupted. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What are you all still doing out here?! Everybody is waiting! The bridesmaids are walking down the aisle as we speak!&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned and saw the wedding planner my mum hired, approaching us with a clipboard and wild eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Sweetie, you need to the your seat,&rdquo; she continued, already dragging Brie away and leading her to the banquet hall. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I followed her with my eyes, seeing her glance back, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell what she was thinking. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Come on, Y/N, we must go,&ldquo; my mum said, grabbing my attention. \"Thank you for doing this. And you look wonderful.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed, putting any thoughts of Brie and I to the back of my mind. I smiled a little, grabbing my mum&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Thank you, mum. You look amazing.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thank you, dear,&ldquo; she said appreciatively. \"You ready?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sucked up a deep breath. &ldquo;I think so&hellip; You nervous?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head confidently. &ldquo;Absolutely not. This is exactly what I want. It&rsquo;s been a long time coming.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded, envying her fearlessness. The two of us eventually stopped by the doors that led into the banquet hall. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You sure you&rsquo;re ready?&ldquo; she asked, facing me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I breathed out, doing what Brie told me. Not even thinking about it. \"I got this. Let&rsquo;s get you married, mum.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grinned and we linked arms before I pushed the doors open. I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it as I kept putting one foot in front of the other, leading my mum down the aisle. The orchestra were playing an instrumental ballad Isaac and my mum had chosen together, and I could see Isaac ahead of us, tearing up at the sight of my mum. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ignored the many eyes of our guests as we neared Isaac, but I would be lying if I said it didn&rsquo;t make my stomach do backflips, and not the good kind. Finally, we reached the altar and the music stopped, the hall going eerily quiet. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thank you, Y/N,&ldquo; my mum whispered before I let her go, standing before her husband-to-be, who gave me a supportive thumbs up for not throwing up. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled at them before taking my position as the maid of honour, stood to my mum&rsquo;s side and in front of the whole room. The wedding officiant began the ceremony and I found my eyes drifting to the guests. I remembered most of them - though not by name - from the rounds I&rsquo;d been making all week. My eyes finally settled on the person I was looking for - Brie. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was sat in the front row, eyes focused on my mum and Isaac. I thought back to what she was going to say earlier - did she remember what happened last night? I wasn&rsquo;t sure, but I hoped she did. If she spoke up about it, I might finally have the guts to say something to her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes drifted to mine and I saw her cheeks turn pink, but she gave me a small smile, nodding my way. I found myself smiling back, feeling my heart beat faster and faster. I had to tell her how I felt. I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the way she made me feel. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the ceremony ended quite beautifully, everybody was led to the reception, which was being held outside by the beach. I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible to outdo the wedding itself, but I was wrong. It was amazing and the food was even better. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie and I were constantly surrounded by guests, so we didn&rsquo;t get the chance to speak properly about what she wanted to tell me, which was slowly killing me, but I tried my best to be patient. Eventually, after everyone had eaten and the speeches had been made (which I almost peed my pants at, not going to lie), everybody was free to do whatever, so I found myself looking for Brie, who had been dragged away by some guests. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I eventually found her by the bar, downing a drink. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&rdquo; I said, making my presence known. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She left the glass on the bar and turned to face me, a small smile on her lips. &ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pursed my lips, trying to figure out what to say. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I never said how great you looked in your dress,&ldquo; she spoke first, before smiling teasingly. \"Never thought I would live to see the day.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glared at her playfully. &ldquo;Gee, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed and then it went quiet between us. I sucked up a deep breath, knowing I wanted to tell her. Whether she was going to tell me or not. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I-&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Do you want to dance?&rdquo; Brie asked before I could get any words out. &ldquo;I mean, we may as well blow everyone away with our amazing newly-developed skills.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw her smiling, but I could see the nerves in her fumbling hands and reluctancy to make a further move. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah, let&rsquo;s dance,&ldquo; I agreed, giving her a reassuring smile, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure why she felt that way. If anything, <i>I </i>was the one trying to talk myself up to tell her the truth. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grabbed her hand, ignoring the accompanied tingling feeling I felt whenever I touched her, and led her to the dance floor where many couples and families were swaying to the slow, but rhythmic music. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"After you, m'lady,&rdquo; I joked, letting her step forward first. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She suppressed a smile and went first before I followed after, resting a hand in hers and the other on her back, as I was taught. She rested her other hand on my waist and I hoped my face wasn&rsquo;t as red as it felt. She met my eyes, her height towering over me a little bit because of her heels, and I found myself mesmerised.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both swayed to the music and I managed not to step on her toes which was good. Maybe the dance lessons paid off&hellip;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay, look, I remember what I said last night,&ldquo; Brie blurted, stopping dancing. She avoided my eyes and let go of me, pinching the bridge of her nose. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You do?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded before meeting my eyes with terrified ones. &ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to make things weird or anything.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chewed on my lip. &ldquo;But you meant it?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked confused. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grew hopeful. &ldquo;Did you mean what you said?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked like she wanted to say no and lie to me, but I held her gaze, urging her to tell me the truth. Finally, she sighed and nodded. &ldquo;I meant it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt relief spread through me. &ldquo;You meant it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pursed her lips, still confused and also nervous. My eyes flickered to her lips and I really wanted to lean forward and kiss her. And not like last time where it was rushed and forced, but properly, where I could fully appreciate it. Appreciate her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You asked me what I would have said if you had asked me out,&ldquo; I said, still distracted by her lips. I stepped a little closer to her, sensing her nervousness. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N it&rsquo;s okay if-&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I met her eyes. &ldquo;I would have said yes.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She raised her eyebrows, eyes widening a little. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself now, feeling a knot of butterflies in my stomach stuck there since last night. I rested my hand on her cheek before closing the gap between us and pressing my lips to hers. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t take long for her to return the kiss, moving her lips against mine in perfect sync. Her hand gripped my waist as she moved forward, our bodies melding together like the final pieces of a puzzle. My insides exploded like fireworks and I hadn&rsquo;t realised how badly I had wanted to kiss her until now. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pulled away, breathlessly, but I chased her lips down and reconnected them with mine, still not over the sensational feeling. Eventually, I pulled away, catching my breath and meeting her coffee-coloured eyes. She was breathtaking. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Ask me,&ldquo; I muttered, caressing her cheek with my thumb. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was nervous, her breath hitching slightly. \"Ask you what?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rested my other hand on top of hers, the one resting on my waist. &ldquo;Ask me out.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A smile fell upon her lips as she shook her head. &ldquo;Y/N-&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Go on,&ldquo; I said, mirroring her smile and nodding encouragingly. \"You wanted to ask me out. So, ask.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She searched my eyes for a hint of playfulness, but I was very much serious. Finally, she grabbed my hands and held onto them, eyes set on mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay, well, Y/N.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yes?&rdquo; I asked, quirking an eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She suppressed a smile, her eyes lighting up. &ldquo;Will you, erm, will you&hellip; oh, god&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Why are you so hesitant?&ldquo; I asked her, staring at her with a disbelieving smile. \"We literally just made out and you&rsquo;re <i>still </i>having doubts?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sighed, letting go of one of my hands so she could massage her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; this is stupid.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No it&rsquo;s not,&ldquo; I assured her, looking lower so she could meet my eyes. \"It&rsquo;s not stupid. It&rsquo;s important. And I don&rsquo;t want you to be scared. I have feelings for you, Brie. And you&rsquo;re not the only one who regrets not saying something about it. But I&rsquo;m saying something now.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I raised our intertwined fingers and kissed her knuckle. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Will you go out with me, Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers?&ldquo; I asked hopefully. \"On a proper date?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brie&rsquo;s lips curled into a smile and she nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grinned. &ldquo;When we get back, I&rsquo;m going to plan something. We&rsquo;re going to do this properly.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She laughed, nodding in agreement. &ldquo;Yes, we will.&rdquo; She pulled me closer and met my eyes. &ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart warmed at how nervous she was still. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You don&rsquo;t even need to ask,&ldquo; I told her, before leaning forward and kissing her again. This one was short, but it said everything we wanted it to. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We finally had each other. </p>",

I felt like I should have said something, but every time I came close, I wimped out. I could see why it took her to get drunk to mention it. It was <i>hard</i>. </p>\n<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was now standing in the beautifully-decorated banquet hall in the hotel, watching as guests filed into their seats in an excited bustle. The wedding was going to start soon and of course my mum only told me now that I was going to be the one walking her down the aisle. It made sense since her parents died a while back, but I never thought about who would take my grandad&rsquo;s place. Apparently it was me. </p>\n<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I feel sick,&ldquo; I muttered, clutching my stomach. The sight of more and more people filling the banquet hall made me more and more queasy. </p>\n</p>",
