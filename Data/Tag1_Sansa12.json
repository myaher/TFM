And she had moved back and she was ready to see him again.\u00a0</p><p><b>Word count:</b> 1.9k</p><p><b>A/N</b>: English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><br/></p><p>She could only remember his name. For years they had been separated and she had slowly forgotten things about him. Like the way he talked. She had only been around 13 when she was forced to move away she had to leave him behind. Now she was 18 and ready to move back to where he lived. </p><p>To be honest, he had always been her crush. Ever since she was a little girl and he had come to their home to play with her older brother, she had liked him. But that was the reason she could have never have him, he was her older brothers best friend. But when she had moved away she had grown to not care about that. She had learned that she loved him, and secretly she hoped he loved her back. </p><p>She put her last suitcase in her dad&rsquo;s car when her mom walked up to her. &ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re going to move back there? We left for a reason.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And I want to go back for a reason,&rdquo; Sansa stated. </p><p>&ldquo;What reason?&rdquo; Her mom asked, &ldquo;You keep talking about this reason but you never tell us what the reason is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because you won&rsquo;t like the reason,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me it&rsquo;s stupid and that it is better to stay here. But I&rsquo;m sure I want to go.&rdquo; Her mom sighed and hugged her. Sansa hugged her back before her mother whispered in her ear. </p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s for that boy, I hope you find happiness.&rdquo; Sansa let go of her mother in shock and looked at her with wide eyes. &ldquo;I always knew you liked him, It was obvious when you looked at him.&rdquo; Sansa started blushing, what if he knew it too?</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa, sweetheart, are you coming?&rdquo; Her dad yelled from the car. </p><p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; Sansa yelled back and she looked at her mom, &ldquo;If will visit you mom, I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I hope you come back with a boyfriend by your side,&rdquo; Her mom smiled at her and Sansa smiled back.</p><p>&ldquo;I think Robb would murder me,&rdquo; Sansa laughed and her mom laughed too. Sansa hugged her one last time and then walked over to her dad&rsquo;s car and got in the car. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; He asked with the biggest grin on her face and Sansa nodded, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, my first daughter to move out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dad, you were less emotional when Robb moved out,&rdquo; Sansa said. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t my oldest daughter,&rdquo; Her dad said and he started the car. They drove away and Sansa looked out of the window. Finally, she was going to see him again, after all those years. Was he even going to recognize her? Sansa wondered. She hoped he still lived where he used to live. </p><p>Robb had moved back to Winterfell years ago. He had told Sansa he had a roommate but never told who. It only came to Sansa now it might be Theon. That would be awkward. What would she have to say to Robb if she told him she was visiting Theon. He would be mad, he was already mad when Joffery flirted with her in front of him. But Theon wasn&rsquo;t Joffery. And Robb knew Theon. </p><p>When they finally arrived at the apartment Sansa had bought she couldn&rsquo;t wait until her father left and she could search for Theon. But her dad insisted on helping her unpack her stuff. </p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s roommate, Margaery, had lived in the place for a year now so there was already furniture. She used to live there with her brother, but he had moved in with his boyfriend not long ago. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Margaery greeted her, &ldquo;Mr.Stark nice to meet you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Margaery,&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s dad said happily, &ldquo;Oh I remember in high school when your dad and I were friends. Lovely to see our daughters are friends too now.&rdquo; Sansa and Margaery looked at each other and they both chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Dad I can handle it on my own now,&rdquo; Sansa said. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;But I want to help,&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s dad insisted again and Sansa looked at Margaery for help.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to show Sansa around town a little,&rdquo; Margaery said, &ldquo;A lot has changed in 5 years, why don&rsquo;t you come back tomorrow, then we&rsquo;ll unpack. You can bring Catelyn too.&rdquo; </p><p>Ned nodded and kissed Sansa on her cheek, &ldquo;Have fun, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow,&rdquo; He said and he left the apartment. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Do you know where he lives?&rdquo; Was the first thing Sansa asked as soon as Ned left and Margaery chuckled again. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Margaery said and Sansa sighed disappointed and looked at the ground, &ldquo;But I do know where his sister lives, she must know where he lives.&rdquo; Sansa looked up again, looking much happier. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; </p><p>The girls left the apartment while Sansa kept asking Margaery stuff about Theon. &ldquo;Sansa, I don&rsquo;t know Theon well,&rdquo; Margaery said when they had almost arrived at Yara&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;I know his sister, Yara.&rdquo; </p><p>Once they arrived Margaery knocked at the door. A girl opened the door and Sansa was sure it wasn&rsquo;t Theon sister. She hadn&rsquo;t seen Yara a lot but she was sure she didn&rsquo;t have white hair. &ldquo;Do you know Yara?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; The girl smiled, &ldquo;She is my friend. I&rsquo;m Daenerys.&rdquo; Sansa smiled at her and Daenerys smiled back, &ldquo;Do you want something from her?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We just want to know where her brother lives,&rdquo; Margaery said. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get her,&rdquo; Daenerys said and she walked away. Soon enough Yara came back. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; She said surprised, &ldquo;Is that you, you&rsquo;ve grown so much!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that happens in five years,&rdquo; Sansa laughed, &ldquo;Do you know where Theon lives, I assume he doesn&rsquo;t live at home anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know he lives with Robb?&rdquo; Yara asked and Sansa let out a little &lsquo;I knew it&rsquo; making Margaery and Yara chuckle, &ldquo;I think you know where Robb lives.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know, thank you,&rdquo; Sansa said and Yara smiled at her before closing the door. Margaery and Sansa walked away from Yara&rsquo;s house and went over to Robb&rsquo;s which wasn&rsquo;t far away. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he never told us,&rdquo; Sansa ranted to Margaery.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he wanted to surprise you,&rdquo; Margaery said, &ldquo;It sure was a surprise for me when I found out my brother was going to live together with my old crush.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But Loras and Renly are dating,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;And besides Robb has a girlfriend.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You can have a relationship with three people,&rdquo; Margaery said and Sansa looked at her with an eyebrow raised. &ldquo;What? I&rsquo;ll never do it.&rdquo; </p><p>Once they arrived at Robbs house Sansa was the one to knock on the door. Again, a girl opened. &ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; She said happily and Sansa assumed this was Talisa. Robb and Talisa had met not long after Robb moved back to Winterfell. &ldquo;Robb told so much about you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He also told me a lot about you,&rdquo; Sansa smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; \u00a0Talisa said and she let the girls in, &ldquo;Robb and Theon are gone but they can be back any moment. Do you want anything to drink?&rdquo; Sansa sat down on the couch and looked at Talisa. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh no,&rdquo; She said and Talisa and Margaery both sat down next to her. They talked for a few more minutes before they heard the door close. </p><p>Sansa could hear Robb&rsquo;s voice getting closer and she stood up. As soon as Robb walked into the living room he stopped. &ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; He said happily and they walked over to each other to hug. &ldquo;How are you? How is Arya? And Bran? And Rickon?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good, I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; Sansa said and the two let go of each other. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Sansa looked past Robb at Theon. He looked surprised to see her here but he was smiling. </p><p>&ldquo;Theon,&rdquo; Sansa said and she walked over to him. The two stared at each other before hugging. </p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful,&rdquo; Theon whispered in Sansa&rsquo;s ear and Sansa started blushing. Robb faked coughed and Sansa could hear Margaery and Talisa chuckle. Sansa and Theon let go of each other. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a walk, just you and me,&rdquo; Theon suggested and Sansa nodded. Before Robb could say anything Theon and Sansa were outside. </p><p>&ldquo;When did you move back here?&rdquo; Was the first thing Theon asked when they started walking.</p><p>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;Five whole years of not being here and I wanted to go back.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lot like your brother,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;He said the same, that he wanted to go back.&rdquo; It stayed silent between the two for a moment before Theon spoke again, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really grown more beautiful in five years.&rdquo; Sansa started blushing again and Theon chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve grown more handsome in five years,&rdquo; Sansa teased him and she swore she saw him blush too. Sansa also chuckled and Theon smiled at her. And when she looked back at him it was like all those feelings from the past years came back at once. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s life?&rdquo; Sansa asked. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kinda jealous of your brother and Talisa. I used to have a girlfriend you know, but she broke up with me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Sansa asked, &ldquo;You had a girlfriend?&rdquo; It hurt her to ask that but she could have known it. Of course she wasn&rsquo;t the only one with a crush on Theon. And he could like people back. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but not for that long,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know if I really liked her or if it was just to prove to my sister I could get one.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Does Yara have a boyfriend?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, she does have a girlfriend,&rdquo; Theon said and Sansa looked confused, &ldquo;Daenerys, come on, you visited her, you must have seen her.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She introduced herself to me as Yara&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; Sansa said. </p><p>&ldquo;She is kinda scared,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;She came out to her brother and he abandoned her. So now she is scared other people might do too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, the next time I see her I&rsquo;ll tell her I&rsquo;m not one of those people,&rdquo; Sansa said and Theon smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo; Theon then asks Sansa.</p><p>&ldquo;I had one, Joffery,&rdquo; Sansa said and Theon groaned, &ldquo;He was horrible, always abused me. My dad had to stop the relationship because I couldn&rsquo;t. I still loved him somehow.&rdquo; </p><p>Theon stopped walking and so did Sansa. &ldquo;You still loved him even though he abused you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I read it&rsquo;s normal.&rdquo; Theon walked forward and grabbed Sansa&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>&ldquo;If someone ever abuses you again come to me,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;If will help you.&rdquo; Sansa looked at her hand which Theon was holding and soon felt his other hand putting her hair behind her ear. </p><p>&ldquo;I liked you when we were younger,&rdquo; Theon then says, &ldquo;And I thought I had forgotten you, but I have never forgotten you. When I saw you again, everything came back.&rdquo; Sansa looked at Theon and smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Theon,&rdquo; She started, but Theon interrupted her. </p><p>&ldquo;Nevermind that, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about,&rdquo; He quickly says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to Robb and.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I liked you too,&rdquo; Sansa says, &ldquo;And I had the same thing, I still like you Theon.&rdquo; Theon looks at Sansa for a moment and then kisses her. It was the first kiss for Sansa with someone that she liked and someone who liked her. And it felt good, way different than with Joffery. </p><p>They let go of each other and just smiled at each other before they heard Robbs voice yell their names in a not so happy way.</p>",

You can bring Catelyn too.\u201d </p><p>Ned nodded and kissed Sansa on her cheek, \u201cHave fun, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d He said and he left the apartment. <br></p><p>\u201cDo you know where he lives?\u201d Was the first thing Sansa asked as soon as Ned left and Margaery chuckled again. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Margaery said and Sansa sighed disappointed and looked at the ground, \u201cBut I do know where his sister lives, she must know where he lives.\u201d Sansa looked up again, looking much happier. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d </p><p>The girls left the apartment while Sansa kept asking Margaery stuff about Theon. \u201cSansa, I don\u2019t know Theon well,\u201d Margaery said when they had almost arrived at Yara\u2019s house, \u201cI know his sister, Yara.\u201d </p><p>Once they arrived Margaery knocked at the door. A girl opened the door and Sansa was sure it wasn\u2019t Theon sister. She hadn\u2019t seen Yara a lot but she was sure she didn\u2019t have white hair. \u201cDo you know Yara?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d The girl smiled, \u201cShe is my friend. I\u2019m Daenerys.\u201d Sansa smiled at her and Daenerys smiled back, \u201cDo you want something from her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe just want to know where her brother lives,\u201d Margaery said. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get her,\u201d Daenerys said and she walked away. Soon enough Yara came back. <br></p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d She said surprised, \u201cIs that you, you\u2019ve grown so much!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that happens in five years,\u201d Sansa laughed, \u201cDo you know where Theon lives, I assume he doesn\u2019t live at home anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know he lives with Robb?\u201d Yara asked and Sansa let out a little \u2018I knew it\u2019 making Margaery and Yara chuckle, \u201cI think you know where Robb lives.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, thank you,\u201d Sansa said and Yara smiled at her before closing the door. Margaery and Sansa walked away from Yara\u2019s house and went over to Robb\u2019s which wasn\u2019t far away. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he never told us,\u201d Sansa ranted to Margaery.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wanted to surprise you,\u201d Margaery said, \u201cIt sure was a surprise for me when I found out my brother was going to live together with my old crush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut Loras and Renly are dating,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cAnd besides Robb has a girlfriend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can have a relationship with three people,\u201d Margaery said and Sansa looked at her with an eyebrow raised. \u201cWhat? I\u2019ll never do it.\u201d </p><p>Once they arrived at Robbs house Sansa was the one to knock on the door. Again, a girl opened. \u201cSansa!\u201d She said happily and Sansa assumed this was Talisa. Robb and Talisa had met not long after Robb moved back to Winterfell. \u201cRobb told so much about you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe also told me a lot about you,\u201d Sansa smiled. </p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d \u00a0Talisa said and she let the girls in, \u201cRobb and Theon are gone but they can be back any moment. Do you want anything to drink?\u201d Sansa sat down on the couch and looked at Talisa. </p><p>\u201cUh no,\u201d She said and Talisa and Margaery both sat down next to her. They talked for a few more minutes before they heard the door close. </p><p>Sansa could hear Robb\u2019s voice getting closer and she stood up. As soon as Robb walked into the living room he stopped. \u201cSansa!\u201d He said happily and they walked over to each other to hug. \u201cHow are you? How is Arya? And Bran? And Rickon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good, I\u2019m good,\u201d Sansa said and the two let go of each other. <br></p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Sansa looked past Robb at Theon. He looked surprised to see her here but he was smiling. </p><p>\u201cTheon,\u201d Sansa said and she walked over to him. The two stared at each other before hugging. </p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Theon whispered in Sansa\u2019s ear and Sansa started blushing. Robb faked coughed and Sansa could hear Margaery and Talisa chuckle. Sansa and Theon let go of each other. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk, just you and me,\u201d Theon suggested and Sansa nodded. Before Robb could say anything Theon and Sansa were outside. </p><p>\u201cWhen did you move back here?\u201d Was the first thing Theon asked when they started walking.</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cFive whole years of not being here and I wanted to go back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like your brother,\u201d Theon said, \u201cHe said the same, that he wanted to go back.\u201d It stayed silent between the two for a moment before Theon spoke again, \u201cYou\u2019ve really grown more beautiful in five years.\u201d Sansa started blushing again and Theon chuckled. </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve grown more handsome in five years,\u201d Sansa teased him and she swore she saw him blush too. Sansa also chuckled and Theon smiled at her. And when she looked back at him it was like all those feelings from the past years came back at once. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s life?\u201d Sansa asked. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Theon said, \u201cI\u2019m kinda jealous of your brother and Talisa. I used to have a girlfriend you know, but she broke up with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sansa asked, \u201cYou had a girlfriend?\u201d It hurt her to ask that but she could have known it. Of course she wasn\u2019t the only one with a crush on Theon. And he could like people back. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but not for that long,\u201d Theon said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I really liked her or if it was just to prove to my sister I could get one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes Yara have a boyfriend?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, she does have a girlfriend,\u201d Theon said and Sansa looked confused, \u201cDaenerys, come on, you visited her, you must have seen her.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe introduced herself to me as Yara\u2019s friend,\u201d Sansa said. </p><p>\u201cShe is kinda scared,\u201d Theon said, \u201cShe came out to her brother and he abandoned her. So now she is scared other people might do too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, the next time I see her I\u2019ll tell her I\u2019m not one of those people,\u201d Sansa said and Theon smiled. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d Theon then asks Sansa.</p><p>\u201cI had one, Joffery,\u201d Sansa said and Theon groaned, \u201cHe was horrible, always abused me. My dad had to stop the relationship because I couldn\u2019t. I still loved him somehow.\u201d </p><p>Theon stopped walking and so did Sansa. \u201cYou still loved him even though he abused you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI read it\u2019s normal.\u201d Theon walked forward and grabbed Sansa\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cIf someone ever abuses you again come to me,\u201d He said, \u201cIf will help you.\u201d Sansa looked at her hand which Theon was holding and soon felt his other hand putting her hair behind her ear. </p><p>\u201cI liked you when we were younger,\u201d Theon then says, \u201cAnd I thought I had forgotten you, but I have never forgotten you. When I saw you again, everything came back.\u201d Sansa looked at Theon and smiled. </p><p>\u201cTheon,\u201d She started, but Theon interrupted her. </p><p>\u201cNevermind that, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He quickly says, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Robb and.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI liked you too,\u201d Sansa says, \u201cAnd I had the same thing, I still like you Theon.\u201d Theon looks at Sansa for a moment and then kisses her. It was the first kiss for Sansa with someone that she liked and someone who liked her. And it felt good, way different than with Joffery. </p><p>They let go of each other and just smiled at each other before they heard Robbs voice yell their names in a not so happy way.</p>",

And she had moved back and she was ready to see him again.\u00a0</p><p><b>Word count:</b> 1.9k</p><p><b>A/N</b>: English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>She could only remember his name. For years they had been separated and she had slowly forgotten things about him. Like the way he talked. She had only been around 13 when she was forced to move away she had to leave him behind. Now she was 18 and ready to move back to where he lived. </p><p>To be honest, he had always been her crush. Ever since she was a little girl and he had come to their home to play with her older brother, she had liked him. But that was the reason she could have never have him, he was her older brothers best friend. But when she had moved away she had grown to not care about that. She had learned that she loved him, and secretly she hoped he loved her back. </p><p>She put her last suitcase in her dad\u2019s car when her mom walked up to her. \u201cSansa,\u201d She said, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to move back there? We left for a reason.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I want to go back for a reason,\u201d Sansa stated. </p><p>\u201cWhat reason?\u201d Her mom asked, \u201cYou keep talking about this reason but you never tell us what the reason is.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBecause you won\u2019t like the reason,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me it\u2019s stupid and that it is better to stay here. But I\u2019m sure I want to go.\u201d Her mom sighed and hugged her. Sansa hugged her back before her mother whispered in her ear. </p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s for that boy, I hope you find happiness.\u201d Sansa let go of her mother in shock and looked at her with wide eyes. \u201cI always knew you liked him, It was obvious when you looked at him.\u201d Sansa started blushing, what if he knew it too?</p><p>\u201cSansa, sweetheart, are you coming?\u201d Her dad yelled from the car. </p><p>\u201cComing,\u201d Sansa yelled back and she looked at her mom, \u201cIf will visit you mom, I promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI hope you come back with a boyfriend by your side,\u201d Her mom smiled at her and Sansa smiled back.</p><p>\u201cI think Robb would murder me,\u201d Sansa laughed and her mom laughed too. Sansa hugged her one last time and then walked over to her dad\u2019s car and got in the car. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d He asked with the biggest grin on her face and Sansa nodded, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, my first daughter to move out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDad, you were less emotional when Robb moved out,\u201d Sansa said. </p><p>\u201cWell, he isn\u2019t my oldest daughter,\u201d Her dad said and he started the car. They drove away and Sansa looked out of the window. Finally, she was going to see him again, after all those years. Was he even going to recognize her? Sansa wondered. She hoped he still lived where he used to live. </p><p>Robb had moved back to Winterfell years ago. He had told Sansa he had a roommate but never told who. It only came to Sansa now it might be Theon. That would be awkward. What would she have to say to Robb if she told him she was visiting Theon. He would be mad, he was already mad when Joffery flirted with her in front of him. But Theon wasn\u2019t Joffery. And Robb knew Theon. </p><p>When they finally arrived at the apartment Sansa had bought she couldn\u2019t wait until her father left and she could search for Theon. But her dad insisted on helping her unpack her stuff. </p><p>Sansa\u2019s roommate, Margaery, had lived in the place for a year now so there was already furniture. She used to live there with her brother, but he had moved in with his boyfriend not long ago. </p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Margaery greeted her, \u201cMr.Stark nice to meet you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMargaery,\u201d Sansa\u2019s dad said happily, \u201cOh I remember in high school when your dad and I were friends. Lovely to see our daughters are friends too now.\u201d Sansa and Margaery looked at each other and they both chuckled. </p><p>\u201cDad I can handle it on my own now,\u201d Sansa said. <br></p><p>\u201cBut I want to help,\u201d Sansa\u2019s dad insisted again and Sansa looked at Margaery for help.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to show Sansa around town a little,\u201d Margaery said, \u201cA lot has changed in 5 years, why don\u2019t you come back tomorrow, then we\u2019ll unpack. You can bring Catelyn too.\u201d </p><p>Ned nodded and kissed Sansa on her cheek, \u201cHave fun, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d He said and he left the apartment. <br></p><p>\u201cDo you know where he lives?\u201d Was the first thing Sansa asked as soon as Ned left and Margaery chuckled again. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Margaery said and Sansa sighed disappointed and looked at the ground, \u201cBut I do know where his sister lives, she must know where he lives.\u201d Sansa looked up again, looking much happier. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d </p><p>The girls left the apartment while Sansa kept asking Margaery stuff about Theon. \u201cSansa, I don\u2019t know Theon well,\u201d Margaery said when they had almost arrived at Yara\u2019s house, \u201cI know his sister, Yara.\u201d </p><p>Once they arrived Margaery knocked at the door. A girl opened the door and Sansa was sure it wasn\u2019t Theon sister. She hadn\u2019t seen Yara a lot but she was sure she didn\u2019t have white hair. \u201cDo you know Yara?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d The girl smiled, \u201cShe is my friend. I\u2019m Daenerys.\u201d Sansa smiled at her and Daenerys smiled back, \u201cDo you want something from her?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe just want to know where her brother lives,\u201d Margaery said. <br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get her,\u201d Daenerys said and she walked away. Soon enough Yara came back. <br></p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d She said surprised, \u201cIs that you, you\u2019ve grown so much!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that happens in five years,\u201d Sansa laughed, \u201cDo you know where Theon lives, I assume he doesn\u2019t live at home anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know he lives with Robb?\u201d Yara asked and Sansa let out a little \u2018I knew it\u2019 making Margaery and Yara chuckle, \u201cI think you know where Robb lives.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know, thank you,\u201d Sansa said and Yara smiled at her before closing the door. Margaery and Sansa walked away from Yara\u2019s house and went over to Robb\u2019s which wasn\u2019t far away. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he never told us,\u201d Sansa ranted to Margaery.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wanted to surprise you,\u201d Margaery said, \u201cIt sure was a surprise for me when I found out my brother was going to live together with my old crush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut Loras and Renly are dating,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cAnd besides Robb has a girlfriend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou can have a relationship with three people,\u201d Margaery said and Sansa looked at her with an eyebrow raised. \u201cWhat? I\u2019ll never do it.\u201d </p><p>Once they arrived at Robbs house Sansa was the one to knock on the door. Again, a girl opened. \u201cSansa!\u201d She said happily and Sansa assumed this was Talisa.

Do you want anything to drink?\u201d Sansa sat down on the couch and looked at Talisa. </p><p>\u201cUh no,\u201d She said and Talisa and Margaery both sat down next to her.

As soon as Robb walked into the living room he stopped. \u201cSansa!\u201d He said happily and they walked over to each other to hug. \u201cHow are you? How is Arya? And Bran? And Rickon?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good, I\u2019m good,\u201d Sansa said and the two let go of each other. <br></p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Sansa looked past Robb at Theon. He looked surprised to see her here but he was smiling. </p><p>\u201cTheon,\u201d Sansa said and she walked over to him. The two stared at each other before hugging. </p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Theon whispered in Sansa\u2019s ear and Sansa started blushing. Robb faked coughed and Sansa could hear Margaery and Talisa chuckle. Sansa and Theon let go of each other. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk, just you and me,\u201d Theon suggested and Sansa nodded. Before Robb could say anything Theon and Sansa were outside. </p><p>\u201cWhen did you move back here?\u201d Was the first thing Theon asked when they started walking.</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cFive whole years of not being here and I wanted to go back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like your brother,\u201d Theon said, \u201cHe said the same, that he wanted to go back.\u201d It stayed silent between the two for a moment before Theon spoke again, \u201cYou\u2019ve really grown more beautiful in five years.\u201d Sansa started blushing again and Theon chuckled. </p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve grown more handsome in five years,\u201d Sansa teased him and she swore she saw him blush too.

Of course she wasn\u2019t the only one with a crush on Theon. And he could like people back. </p><p>\u201cYeah, but not for that long,\u201d Theon said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I really liked her or if it was just to prove to my sister I could get one.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoes Yara have a boyfriend?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, she does have a girlfriend,\u201d Theon said and Sansa looked confused, \u201cDaenerys, come on, you visited her, you must have seen her.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe introduced herself to me as Yara\u2019s friend,\u201d Sansa said. </p><p>\u201cShe is kinda scared,\u201d Theon said, \u201cShe came out to her brother and he abandoned her. So now she is scared other people might do too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, the next time I see her I\u2019ll tell her I\u2019m not one of those people,\u201d Sansa said and Theon smiled. </p><p>\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d Theon then asks Sansa.</p><p>\u201cI had one, Joffery,\u201d Sansa said and Theon groaned, \u201cHe was horrible, always abused me. My dad had to stop the relationship because I couldn\u2019t. I still loved him somehow.\u201d </p><p>Theon stopped walking and so did Sansa. \u201cYou still loved him even though he abused you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI read it\u2019s normal.\u201d Theon walked forward and grabbed Sansa\u2019s hand. </p><p>\u201cIf someone ever abuses you again come to me,\u201d He said, \u201cIf will help you.\u201d Sansa looked at her hand which Theon was holding and soon felt his other hand putting her hair behind her ear. </p><p>\u201cI liked you when we were younger,\u201d Theon then says, \u201cAnd I thought I had forgotten you, but I have never forgotten you. When I saw you again, everything came back.\u201d Sansa looked at Theon and smiled. </p><p>\u201cTheon,\u201d She started, but Theon interrupted her. </p><p>\u201cNevermind that, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d He quickly says, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Robb and.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI liked you too,\u201d Sansa says, \u201cAnd I had the same thing, I still like you Theon.\u201d Theon looks at Sansa for a moment and then kisses her. It was the first kiss for Sansa with someone that she liked and someone who liked her. And it felt good, way different than with Joffery. </p><p>They let go of each other and just smiled at each other before they heard Robbs voice yell their names in a not so happy way.</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Summary:</b> Sansa had moved away from Theon years ago. And she had moved back and she was ready to see him again.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Word count:</b> 1.9k</p><p><b>A/N</b>: English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><br /></p><p>She could only remember his name. For years they had been separated and she had slowly forgotten things about him. Like the way he talked. She had only been around 13 when she was forced to move away she had to leave him behind. Now she was 18 and ready to move back to where he lived. </p><p>To be honest, he had always been her crush. Ever since she was a little girl and he had come to their home to play with her older brother, she had liked him. But that was the reason she could have never have him, he was her older brothers best friend. But when she had moved away she had grown to not care about that. She had learned that she loved him, and secretly she hoped he loved her back. </p><p>She put her last suitcase in her dad&rsquo;s car when her mom walked up to her. &ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re going to move back there? We left for a reason.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And I want to go back for a reason,&rdquo; Sansa stated. </p><p>&ldquo;What reason?&rdquo; Her mom asked, &ldquo;You keep talking about this reason but you never tell us what the reason is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Because you won&rsquo;t like the reason,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me it&rsquo;s stupid and that it is better to stay here. But I&rsquo;m sure I want to go.&rdquo; Her mom sighed and hugged her. Sansa hugged her back before her mother whispered in her ear. </p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s for that boy, I hope you find happiness.&rdquo; Sansa let go of her mother in shock and looked at her with wide eyes. &ldquo;I always knew you liked him, It was obvious when you looked at him.&rdquo; Sansa started blushing, what if he knew it too?</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa, sweetheart, are you coming?&rdquo; Her dad yelled from the car. </p><p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; Sansa yelled back and she looked at her mom, &ldquo;If will visit you mom, I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I hope you come back with a boyfriend by your side,&rdquo; Her mom smiled at her and Sansa smiled back.</p><p>&ldquo;I think Robb would murder me,&rdquo; Sansa laughed and her mom laughed too. Sansa hugged her one last time and then walked over to her dad&rsquo;s car and got in the car. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; He asked with the biggest grin on her face and Sansa nodded, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, my first daughter to move out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dad, you were less emotional when Robb moved out,&rdquo; Sansa said. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t my oldest daughter,&rdquo; Her dad said and he started the car. They drove away and Sansa looked out of the window. Finally, she was going to see him again, after all those years. Was he even going to recognize her? Sansa wondered. She hoped he still lived where he used to live. </p><p>Robb had moved back to Winterfell years ago. He had told Sansa he had a roommate but never told who. It only came to Sansa now it might be Theon. That would be awkward. What would she have to say to Robb if she told him she was visiting Theon. He would be mad, he was already mad when Joffery flirted with her in front of him. But Theon wasn&rsquo;t Joffery. And Robb knew Theon. </p><p>When they finally arrived at the apartment Sansa had bought she couldn&rsquo;t wait until her father left and she could search for Theon. But her dad insisted on helping her unpack her stuff. </p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s roommate, Margaery, had lived in the place for a year now so there was already furniture. She used to live there with her brother, but he had moved in with his boyfriend not long ago. </p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Margaery greeted her, &ldquo;Mr.Stark nice to meet you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Margaery,&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s dad said happily, &ldquo;Oh I remember in high school when your dad and I were friends. Lovely to see our daughters are friends too now.&rdquo; Sansa and Margaery looked at each other and they both chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Dad I can handle it on my own now,&rdquo; Sansa said. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;But I want to help,&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s dad insisted again and Sansa looked at Margaery for help.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to show Sansa around town a little,&rdquo; Margaery said, &ldquo;A lot has changed in 5 years, why don&rsquo;t you come back tomorrow, then we&rsquo;ll unpack. You can bring Catelyn too.&rdquo; </p><p>Ned nodded and kissed Sansa on her cheek, &ldquo;Have fun, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow,&rdquo; He said and he left the apartment. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you know where he lives?&rdquo; Was the first thing Sansa asked as soon as Ned left and Margaery chuckled again. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Margaery said and Sansa sighed disappointed and looked at the ground, &ldquo;But I do know where his sister lives, she must know where he lives.&rdquo; Sansa looked up again, looking much happier. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; </p><p>The girls left the apartment while Sansa kept asking Margaery stuff about Theon. &ldquo;Sansa, I don&rsquo;t know Theon well,&rdquo; Margaery said when they had almost arrived at Yara&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;I know his sister, Yara.&rdquo; </p><p>Once they arrived Margaery knocked at the door. A girl opened the door and Sansa was sure it wasn&rsquo;t Theon sister. She hadn&rsquo;t seen Yara a lot but she was sure she didn&rsquo;t have white hair. &ldquo;Do you know Yara?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; The girl smiled, &ldquo;She is my friend. I&rsquo;m Daenerys.&rdquo; Sansa smiled at her and Daenerys smiled back, &ldquo;Do you want something from her?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We just want to know where her brother lives,&rdquo; Margaery said. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get her,&rdquo; Daenerys said and she walked away. Soon enough Yara came back. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; She said surprised, &ldquo;Is that you, you&rsquo;ve grown so much!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, that happens in five years,&rdquo; Sansa laughed, &ldquo;Do you know where Theon lives, I assume he doesn&rsquo;t live at home anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know he lives with Robb?&rdquo; Yara asked and Sansa let out a little &lsquo;I knew it&rsquo; making Margaery and Yara chuckle, &ldquo;I think you know where Robb lives.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know, thank you,&rdquo; Sansa said and Yara smiled at her before closing the door. Margaery and Sansa walked away from Yara&rsquo;s house and went over to Robb&rsquo;s which wasn&rsquo;t far away. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he never told us,&rdquo; Sansa ranted to Margaery.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he wanted to surprise you,&rdquo; Margaery said, &ldquo;It sure was a surprise for me when I found out my brother was going to live together with my old crush.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But Loras and Renly are dating,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;And besides Robb has a girlfriend.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You can have a relationship with three people,&rdquo; Margaery said and Sansa looked at her with an eyebrow raised. &ldquo;What? I&rsquo;ll never do it.&rdquo; </p><p>Once they arrived at Robbs house Sansa was the one to knock on the door. Again, a girl opened. &ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; She said happily and Sansa assumed this was Talisa. Robb and Talisa had met not long after Robb moved back to Winterfell. &ldquo;Robb told so much about you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He also told me a lot about you,&rdquo; Sansa smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; &nbsp;Talisa said and she let the girls in, &ldquo;Robb and Theon are gone but they can be back any moment. Do you want anything to drink?&rdquo; Sansa sat down on the couch and looked at Talisa. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh no,&rdquo; She said and Talisa and Margaery both sat down next to her. They talked for a few more minutes before they heard the door close. </p><p>Sansa could hear Robb&rsquo;s voice getting closer and she stood up. As soon as Robb walked into the living room he stopped. &ldquo;Sansa!&rdquo; He said happily and they walked over to each other to hug. &ldquo;How are you? How is Arya? And Bran? And Rickon?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good, I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; Sansa said and the two let go of each other. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; Sansa looked past Robb at Theon. He looked surprised to see her here but he was smiling. </p><p>&ldquo;Theon,&rdquo; Sansa said and she walked over to him. The two stared at each other before hugging. </p><p>&ldquo;You look beautiful,&rdquo; Theon whispered in Sansa&rsquo;s ear and Sansa started blushing. Robb faked coughed and Sansa could hear Margaery and Talisa chuckle. Sansa and Theon let go of each other. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a walk, just you and me,&rdquo; Theon suggested and Sansa nodded. Before Robb could say anything Theon and Sansa were outside. </p><p>&ldquo;When did you move back here?&rdquo; Was the first thing Theon asked when they started walking.</p><p>&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;Five whole years of not being here and I wanted to go back.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lot like your brother,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;He said the same, that he wanted to go back.&rdquo; It stayed silent between the two for a moment before Theon spoke again, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really grown more beautiful in five years.&rdquo; Sansa started blushing again and Theon chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve grown more handsome in five years,&rdquo; Sansa teased him and she swore she saw him blush too. Sansa also chuckled and Theon smiled at her. And when she looked back at him it was like all those feelings from the past years came back at once. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s life?&rdquo; Sansa asked. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kinda jealous of your brother and Talisa. I used to have a girlfriend you know, but she broke up with me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Sansa asked, &ldquo;You had a girlfriend?&rdquo; It hurt her to ask that but she could have known it. Of course she wasn&rsquo;t the only one with a crush on Theon. And he could like people back. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but not for that long,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know if I really liked her or if it was just to prove to my sister I could get one.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Does Yara have a boyfriend?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, she does have a girlfriend,&rdquo; Theon said and Sansa looked confused, &ldquo;Daenerys, come on, you visited her, you must have seen her.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She introduced herself to me as Yara&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; Sansa said. </p><p>&ldquo;She is kinda scared,&rdquo; Theon said, &ldquo;She came out to her brother and he abandoned her. So now she is scared other people might do too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, the next time I see her I&rsquo;ll tell her I&rsquo;m not one of those people,&rdquo; Sansa said and Theon smiled. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo; Theon then asks Sansa.</p><p>&ldquo;I had one, Joffery,&rdquo; Sansa said and Theon groaned, &ldquo;He was horrible, always abused me. My dad had to stop the relationship because I couldn&rsquo;t. I still loved him somehow.&rdquo; </p><p>Theon stopped walking and so did Sansa. &ldquo;You still loved him even though he abused you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I read it&rsquo;s normal.&rdquo; Theon walked forward and grabbed Sansa&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>&ldquo;If someone ever abuses you again come to me,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;If will help you.&rdquo; Sansa looked at her hand which Theon was holding and soon felt his other hand putting her hair behind her ear. </p><p>&ldquo;I liked you when we were younger,&rdquo; Theon then says, &ldquo;And I thought I had forgotten you, but I have never forgotten you.

But, with Alayne/Sansa planning to marry Harry the Heir, how will Cissy or Saffron feel about that? I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I can\u2019t remember much of their feelings (if they were even described). Will they be angry or jealous? Do they still love Harry? Especially Saffron since I believe she\u2019s still pregnant with his child. Or do they not care? Would Sansa befriend them?.... etc.",
        "answer": "<p>I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see much if anything of Cissy, sadly. All Harry mentioned of her was that \u201cLady Anya arranged for her to marry one of her men-at-arms\u201d.

The last thing sansa needs is to be in  a relationship where she's doing all the work and ESPECIALLY carrying all the emotional labor. She also needs someone who sees how brilliant and how good of  politican/ leader she is. Tho, I have seen ppl kinda romanticize that, Sansa being all jon needs and him giving her nothing in return",
        "answer": "<p>I don\u2019t see what people find appealing about it anymore. I mean in a general sense, it\u2019s already not an interesting ship. There\u2019s nothing remotely dynamic or unique about Jon. Not only that, but he treats her poorly and doesn\u2019t really respect Sansa. Jon not only never truly considers her opinions or her council, but he often even puts what she brings to the table down. He told her that she sounds like she admires the woman that literally abused her. He was willing to use the past tension between Sansa and Arya to his advantage. He only cares about her opinion when it validates him and what he\u2019s doing but the moment she (a feminine woman) has her own opinions, she no longer has any worth to him. He even was complicit in Daenerys\u2019s genocide of King\u2019s Landing (and justified it as well) and literally was about let her do the same to the rest of the world including the North (he would have if it wasn\u2019t for Tyrion urging him). Not only has Jon being terrible to her, but as you said, he\u2019s a mediocre leader (especially because he doesn\u2019t consider anyone\u2019s opinion but his own) and all the responsibility ends up falling in her hands, and she is left having to fix things whenever he messes up (ex: had to keep the Northern Lords on their side, had to regain Northern Independence, etc). Sansa may not always have agreed with Jon and some of the things he does, but she has gone above and beyond for him&hellip;while he can\u2019t even let her finish saying what she wants to say at a damn meeting.\u00a0</p>",
