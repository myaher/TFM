I understand the sadness and unwanted guilt you feel whenever you look at me and my head has turned the other way. My eyes either focusing someplace or fidgeting with the air around me. My mind is anything but calm. When I want to explain things, my mind goes blank and leaves me with no words to speak. There are so many things I want to say, but I do not know how to say them right, because I do not want to say something that I will regret. Neither do I want to upset anyone, and that causes my mind trouble, because often my thoughts must seem wicked to those who are suppressing their feelings by being loud. That including you, my guardians.</i></p><p><i>Love, best regards, will miss you, your son, Jungkook. Jeon. </i></p><hr><p>He wakes up with a burning sensation near his chest. At first, his temperature rises slightly, but as his light snores are deafened by the fire cackling, he feels his fingertips turning to dust. Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes fling open and his head turns in different directions as if he has tics. His eyes flicker all around. The surroundings are all burnt to the ground. He lets out a shout begging for the fire to die down. The fire places itself on his hands, and whilst it doesn&rsquo;t spread anywhere further, Jungkook wishes it would, for if his whole body was aching with pain, he&rsquo;d get used to the feeling.<br/></p><p>Taehyung cries, &ldquo;if I cannot move heaven,&rdquo; and he tilts his head a little to the right and looks straight down upon , leaving nothing but rubble behind. His lips form a smirk as he shouts, &ldquo;I will raise hell!&rdquo;</p><p>Jungkook wakes by his head falling over. Reality washes over him, and his heart skips a beat when he brings his hands up to the light. Turning the limbs dusted with coal over and over, his head starts hurting. He lets out a deep sigh as he closes his eyes and lets his arms dump down along his sides.</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s fingertips feel a little cold. <i>No wonder,</i> he thinks. He has just thrown all of his heat onto the little town under the skies. The town that he despises, but not enough to forget about sugar-coating the way the fire had started. He sat fire to a part of the forest where no one ever wanders. Hereafter he spread the fire like crazy. <i>Atheism has turned the whole world against god and me. They&rsquo;d just make up another theory like big bang on how the fire struck their town. Bullshit</i>. He huffs, and like a dragon, more fire is spit at the frightened people. <i>How corrupt they are</i>. Up on the clouds, from where Taehyung had cursed the town, the skies had turned grey and soon where to pour, but only after Taehyung got off of them. He is on his way to the lighter skies, perhaps on another ravage. He always feels better after wreaking havoc. As he nears the spotless clouds, he grows a suspicion that something is off. He stops walking and closes his eyes to try and seek the bad feeling inside of his guts. His mind wanders toward somewhere bright, and he hisses of discomfort. Once a voice speaks up, he quits babying and focuses only on using his ears. &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m begging you. Please help me. I know of the bad I have done, so I come to you-&rdquo; with eyes wide open, Taehyung sprints down from the cloud and at the speed of light he flies toward the sound of the voice of a person he once used to think so highly of. He jumps down toward the town he left in ruins. Before said person gets to speak another word, Taehyung cuts the connection off to the deity. Taehyung now stands alone in a hospital room with a sad soul. &ldquo;Taehyung&rdquo; the dimly lit soul whimpers. </p><p>&ldquo;I need your help,&rdquo; Taehyung&rsquo;s eyes are forced to look down at the soul&rsquo;s hands - the hands the soul doesn&rsquo;t have. So he slowly let his head drift back up and I swear his heart broke all over again, as he stared into the eyes of his past lover. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&rdquo; is all Taehyung has the strength to say right before he catches the soul, now with a body, in his shaking arms.</p><p>Jungkook feels his lips quiver as he waits for Taehyung to speak up. Taehyung is pacing around the abandoned hospital room. Jungkook is sitting on the creaky mattress, where he almost started praying for Taehyung not to burn him and pull apart his remaining bones. &ldquo;Why were you in that town?&rdquo; whilst Taehyung knows the answer, he dreads hearing it coming from Jungkook, and so Jungkook is debating whether or not to stand up to this devil man, for while he knows what Taehyung is capable of, he is not sure of how willing he is to demonstrate all of his torturous ways on him. &ldquo;Say it, please&rdquo; Taehyung&rsquo;s voice is low and disappointed. Jungkook ponders for a minute. &ldquo;I wanted to see you,&rdquo; Taehyung feels only Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes at his back. He is unsure of what feelings are taking over his head at the moment. He wants to tear Jungkook apart for his stupid actions, but nonetheless does he want to engulf him into what <i>actual people</i> call a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what I have to go through now, because you couldn&rsquo;t help your <i>human desires</i>?&rdquo; He asks, slowly letting his body turn around. He stares into Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes with those of himself that are darker than midnight. The whole scene triggers a Deja vu within Jungkook, and because Deja vu is only a feeling, Jungkook immediately reformulates the situation from Deja vu, to <i>flashback. </i>And by doing so, Jungkook leaves the present to visit the past within a flashback. Taehyung watches carefully as Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes slowly close and his body falls to the floor. As he nears the unconscious body to feel for a pulse, he retreats back as soon as his index and middle finger touch the boy&rsquo;s delicate skin.

He has just thrown all of his heat onto the little town under the skies. The town that he despises, but not enough to forget about sugar-coating the way the fire had started. He sat fire to a part of the forest where no one ever wanders. Hereafter he spread the fire like crazy. <i>Atheism has turned the whole world against god and me.

He huffs, and like a dragon, more fire is spit at the frightened people. <i>How corrupt they are</i>. Up on the clouds, from where Taehyung had cursed the town, the skies had turned grey and soon where to pour, but only after Taehyung got off of them. He is on his way to the lighter skies, perhaps on another ravage. He always feels better after wreaking havoc. As he nears the spotless clouds, he grows a suspicion that something is off. He stops walking and closes his eyes to try and seek the bad feeling inside of his guts. His mind wanders toward somewhere bright, and he hisses of discomfort. Once a voice speaks up, he quits babying and focuses only on using his ears. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you. Please help me. I know of the bad I have done, so I come to you-\u201d with eyes wide open, Taehyung sprints down from the cloud and at the speed of light he flies toward the sound of the voice of a person he once used to think so highly of. He jumps down toward the town he left in ruins. Before said person gets to speak another word, Taehyung cuts the connection off to the deity. Taehyung now stands alone in a hospital room with a sad soul. \u201cTaehyung\u201d the dimly lit soul whimpers. </p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Taehyung\u2019s eyes are forced to look down at the soul\u2019s hands - the hands the soul doesn\u2019t have. So he slowly let his head drift back up and I swear his heart broke all over again, as he stared into the eyes of his past lover. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u201d is all Taehyung has the strength to say right before he catches the soul, now with a body, in his shaking arms.</p><p>Jungkook feels his lips quiver as he waits for Taehyung to speak up. Taehyung is pacing around the abandoned hospital room. Jungkook is sitting on the creaky mattress, where he almost started praying for Taehyung not to burn him and pull apart his remaining bones. \u201cWhy were you in that town?\u201d whilst Taehyung knows the answer, he dreads hearing it coming from Jungkook, and so Jungkook is debating whether or not to stand up to this devil man, for while he knows what Taehyung is capable of, he is not sure of how willing he is to demonstrate all of his torturous ways on him. \u201cSay it, please\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice is low and disappointed. Jungkook ponders for a minute. \u201cI wanted to see you,\u201d Taehyung feels only Jungkook\u2019s eyes at his back. He is unsure of what feelings are taking over his head at the moment. He wants to tear Jungkook apart for his stupid actions, but nonetheless does he want to engulf him into what <i>actual people</i> call a hug.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I have to go through now, because you couldn\u2019t help your <i>human desires</i>?\u201d He asks, slowly letting his body turn around. He stares into Jungkook\u2019s eyes with those of himself that are darker than midnight. The whole scene triggers a Deja vu within Jungkook, and because Deja vu is only a feeling, Jungkook immediately reformulates the situation from Deja vu, to <i>flashback. </i>And by doing so, Jungkook leaves the present to visit the past within a flashback. Taehyung watches carefully as Jungkook\u2019s eyes slowly close and his body falls to the floor. As he nears the unconscious body to feel for a pulse, he retreats back as soon as his index and middle finger touch the boy\u2019s delicate skin. He hears a voice in the back of his mind asking him how he had ever dared lay a finger on such an innocent soul, bringing him to hell for successfully tempting him.

Up on the clouds, from where Taehyung had cursed the town, the skies had turned grey and soon where to pour, but only after Taehyung got off of them. He is on his way to the lighter skies, perhaps on another ravage. He always feels better after wreaking havoc. As he nears the spotless clouds, he grows a suspicion that something is off. He stops walking and closes his eyes to try and seek the bad feeling inside of his guts. His mind wanders toward somewhere bright, and he hisses of discomfort. Once a voice speaks up, he quits babying and focuses only on using his ears. &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m begging you. Please help me. I know of the bad I have done, so I come to you-&rdquo; with eyes wide open, Taehyung sprints down from the cloud and at the speed of light he flies toward the sound of the voice of a person he once used to think so highly of. He jumps down toward the town he left in ruins. Before said person gets to speak another word, Taehyung cuts the connection off to the deity. Taehyung now stands alone in a hospital room with a sad soul. &ldquo;Taehyung&rdquo; the dimly lit soul whimpers. </p><p>&ldquo;I need your help,&rdquo; Taehyung&rsquo;s eyes are forced to look down at the soul&rsquo;s hands - the hands the soul doesn&rsquo;t have. So he slowly let his head drift back up and I swear his heart broke all over again, as he stared into the eyes of his past lover. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&rdquo; is all Taehyung has the strength to say right before he catches the soul, now with a body, in his shaking arms.</p><p>Jungkook feels his lips quiver as he waits for Taehyung to speak up. Taehyung is pacing around the abandoned hospital room. Jungkook is sitting on the creaky mattress, where he almost started praying for Taehyung not to burn him and pull apart his remaining bones. &ldquo;Why were you in that town?&rdquo; whilst Taehyung knows the answer, he dreads hearing it coming from Jungkook, and so Jungkook is debating whether or not to stand up to this devil man, for while he knows what Taehyung is capable of, he is not sure of how willing he is to demonstrate all of his torturous ways on him. &ldquo;Say it, please&rdquo; Taehyung&rsquo;s voice is low and disappointed. Jungkook ponders for a minute. &ldquo;I wanted to see you,&rdquo; Taehyung feels only Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes at his back. He is unsure of what feelings are taking over his head at the moment. He wants to tear Jungkook apart for his stupid actions, but nonetheless does he want to engulf him into what <i>actual people</i> call a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what I have to go through now, because you couldn&rsquo;t help your <i>human desires</i>?&rdquo; He asks, slowly letting his body turn around. He stares into Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes with those of himself that are darker than midnight. The whole scene triggers a Deja vu within Jungkook, and because Deja vu is only a feeling, Jungkook immediately reformulates the situation from Deja vu, to <i>flashback. </i>And by doing so, Jungkook leaves the present to visit the past within a flashback. Taehyung watches carefully as Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes slowly close and his body falls to the floor. As he nears the unconscious body to feel for a pulse, he retreats back as soon as his index and middle finger touch the boy&rsquo;s delicate skin. He hears a voice in the back of his mind asking him how he had ever dared lay a finger on such an innocent soul, bringing him to hell for successfully tempting him. As Jungkook&rsquo;s mind races, Taehyung&rsquo;s eyes soften, and his mouth agape, as he looks at the dainty boy before him.</p><hr /><p>The colours on the walls are fading. The once very saturated pink is now white with a pink tint. Walking away from the halls and into the bigger room, the colours are even more popping. It still smells of paint, meaning a paint-job was performed not too long ago; or no one cares enough to open windows and doors to freshen the room. Walking further into the room there are two turning points; the left leads to a smaller corner that has not been touched in forever, hence the dust piling up against the white baseboard. The right path leads to a bigger area where loud chatter can be heard.</p><p>Turning left, all there is to be seen is a big, brown storage cabinet with closed doors. Its scent is so strong, that even while standing many feet away from it, and with the smell of paint, the cabinet still smells of old books. And any movements, even a couple feet away from the cabinet, will lead a dozen of dust particles around the small corner. The two walls around the cabinet are grey and full of hollow holes ranging from sizes of a teacup to peas. . Walking back into the centre of the room, the right side is still unseen. Walking that way leads to a bigger side of the room. In this end of the room the walls are decorated with tropical flowers painted across the walls. The background colours are a mix between a very bright red and a dark blue, making the walls a matte purple. The hospital room sure is colourful. Maybe it was painted on purpose for someone who might not experience colour anywhere else.</p><p>To the right of the corridor, the king-sized bed is crowded by a doctor, a nurse and two middle-aged, stressed looking people. &ldquo;How much longer will I stay here?&rdquo; Asks the boy timidly. The kids he used to play with in school told him, that rude kids would have to stay in the hospital for longer. Since then, Jungkook has always been nervous near the doctors. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say for sure yet, but wait a couple weeks and we shall have another conversation. Are you taking your meds regularly?&rdquo; Jungkook nods with an unfortunately big and fake smile on his face. The doctor looks at him with pinched eyes and tight lips. Any kid should have gotten better by now. &ldquo;I have been keeping track, doctor, and Jungkook has been taking every medication that has been given to him.&rdquo; Jungkook thinks, that if the sweet nurse, with the straight and shoulder length black hair, had not been there to keep him company, and sweet talk him whenever the doctor visited, he would not have taken his medicine. And he would not have told his parents to stay strong for him. His nurse made life hospital bearable. Better than bearable and suddenly he had started dreading the day he was to leave the colourful room. If he ever was to.</p><p>Soon everyone had made their leave, and once again Jungkook was alone in the room where he had begun to feel at home. </p></p>",
