However\u2026\u201d Now she finally looked\nat the others. \u201cIt is too powerful for it not to manifest in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManifest?\u201d Rubio repeated, curious.</p><p>\u201cYes. Even if she is not trained,\nmagic this intense finds a way to get out.\u201d The mage explained. \u201cShe should\nhave some peculiar talent. In cases like these, it normally is having visions\nof the future, healing powers or even talking to animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone would know if she had any\nof these gifts, no?\u201d Bill commented.</p><p>Someone snorted. They all turned to\nfind the women rolling their eyes at Bill.</p><p>\u201cSomething we missed, ladies?\u201d\nBedivere asked politely.</p><p>Ada, who was only a bit older than Arthur,\nbut had helped raising him, gave Bedivere a flat look. \u201cSomeone would know? Has\nit occurred to you that, if she can do any of those things, she is very likely\nto keep very quiet about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rubio was confused.</p><p>The women groaned in frustration.\n\u201cWet Stick, what happened to Daisy when she was accused of witchcraft last\nyear, for no reason other than the fact she was a good healer?\u201d Sigrid asked.</p><p>Wet Stick winced. \u201cShe was taken by\nthe soldiers and we never saw her again.\u201d He told the others.</p><p>\u201cWomen with \u2018gifts\u2019 are hardly ever\nwell seen.\u201d Ada told Bedivere. \u201cBeing a noble lady might give her some\nprotection, but she would never tell people. I don\u2019t believe Westeros is that\ndifferent from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is right.\u201d The Mage called.\n\u201cThere is a chance she might not even know she has gifts, but if she does\u2026 She\nhas no reason to tell people. Especially if she has a story as tragic as she supposedly\ndoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he will do to\nher?\u201d Arthur spoke for the first time since it all had started.</p><p>His body was tense, his jaw locked.\nBedivere and Bill traded looks, but refrained from commenting at that moment.</p><p>\u201cHe is going to sacrifice her.\u201d The\nMage spoke, full of conviction. \u201cHe would never use her for anything else;\nshe\u2019s perfect: noble blood, magic, virgin\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that last part?\u201d Back Lack asked confused.</p><p>\u201cThe hair told me all I needed to\nknow.\u201d She informed him.</p><p>The man made a disgruntled face,\nmaking Wet Stick and Percival snort.</p><p>\u201cThis is easy to fix.\u201d Bill suddenly\nsaid.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Rubio asked.</p><p>\u201cIf he needs a virgin sacrifice, and\nshe is not a virgin anymore\u2026\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to finish the\nthought, they\u2019d all understood it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Judith, another one of the\ngirls, drawled. \u201cBecause it will be very simple to go to a noble lady and tell\nher she needs to sleep with someone for the sake of England.\u201d She finished\ndryly.</p><p>\n\u201cBecause I expect that is what you\u2019re suggesting right there, Bill.\u201d Arthur\nsaid, his voice deadly cold.</p><p>Bill arched a brow. \u201cI expect you\nknow me well enough to be aware that it is, in fact, what I am suggesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us take a deep breath, mates.\u201d\nBack Lack put his hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLadies, what do you think we\nshould do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good time to just\ntell her the truth.\u201d Ada offered. \u201cIf she feels you lot are hiding something\nfrom her, she might be more inclined to believe in the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Sarah, another of the\ngirls nodded. \u201cGet Maggie to tell her the truth, she might like us a bit more\nthan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s on his side already?\u201d\nArthur pointed out. \u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t believe us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to take the risk.\u201d The Mage\nanswered from her place. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to let him have her. If she won\u2019t\nbelieve us\u2026 We will need to do something about it.\u201d</p><p>Arthur took a deep breath. \u201cSo\nyou\u2019re suggesting we kill her if she doesn\u2019t believe us.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either her or England.\u201d The\nMage indicated simply. \u201cWhich one would you choose?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even need to answer that.</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa hadn\u2019t slept after Arthur\nleft; she hadn\u2019t managed to even close her eyes. He\u2019d scared her, badly. For\nall this time she\u2019d been living in England, she\u2019d tried to forget everything\nthat happened to her in Westeros, she tried to convince herself it wasn\u2019t her\nlife anymore.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been so na\u00efve.\nAgain.</p><p>She didn\u2019t question Vortigern\nmotives, and she should have. By now she knew the King well enough to know he\nwould never have brought her to Camelot if he didn\u2019t have a plan for her.\nHowever, she chose to pretend he was just bored or something, and that he just wanted\na companion for his daughter.</p><p>She had been willingly blind;\nVortigern could get a thousand girls to keep Katia company without even walking\nfar. He had no reason to need specifically her, he had no reason to trouble\nhimself with bringing her all the way from King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Which meant he wanted something.</p><p>After her first year there, Sansa\nhad started thinking Vortigern wanted to either marry her himself or marry her\noff to someone else. He was extremely protective of her, and many of the guards\nwouldn\u2019t talk or even look at her. She thought he was saving her for some\nreason and the only logical one was marriage.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Now she was not so sure anymore. To\nbe honest, since that damned day that Arthur came into her way she wasn\u2019t sure\nof anything anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d destroyed her peace and he was\nstill doing it.</p><p>For a man like him it was easy to\nsay she just needed to fight back and be her own hero. He was raised to fight,\nand believe that because he could carry a sword the world was his for the\ntaking. He grew up knowing his strength would be measured by what he could do\nwith said sword, and that men would respect him if he was bigger and meaner\nthan the others.</p><p>Sansa had been raised to be a wife\nand a mother. She heard a thousand times her kindness and graciousness should\nbe her biggest assets, and that a woman should turn her face away from\nviolence. She was never raised to be a fighter, she was supposed to have a\nfamily as soon as possible and care for that family. All the fighting should be\nleft to the men.</p><p>He spoke like she was in this\nsituation just because she wanted, as if it would be as simple as picking up a\nsword and she could go anywhere she wanted.</p><p>Men hardly ever understood.</p><p>\u201cThis is not fair!\u201d She heard Katia\nprotesting.</p><p>Sansa hurried down the stairs, only\nto find Mercia looking down at Katia. \u201cIt is what the King wishes, therefore,\nit shall happen.\u201d He informed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sansa asked,\nstanding by Katia.</p><p>\u201cMy father wants us back in\nCamelot!\u201d Katia cried, grabbing Sansa\u2019s arm. \u201cHe heard about some commotion in\nLondinium and now he wants me to go back. This is not fair!\u201d She insisted. \u201cI\nwas not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Lady Sansa and Lady Maggie\nwere.\u201d Mercia turned his eyes to Sansa, and she felt the accusation on them.\n\u201cNow, we cannot allow them to be in danger, can we?\u201d</p><p>Sansa cleared her throat. \u201cLord\nMercia, this is hardly necessary. Maybe we can stay a few more days, no more\nvisits to\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cThe King was clear.\u201d He cut her, without any respect. \u201cYou are going back to\nLondinium now.\u201d</p><p>Katia\u2019s eyes welled in tears, then\nshe stormed off to the bedroom she had been given.</p><p>Sansa turned to follow her, when\nMercia\u2019s voice stopped her. \u201cMake sure she packs fast, Lady Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had to control her expression\nas she nodded at him and followed Katia back to her room.</p><p>It was quite curious that, despite\nbeing older than Katia, Sansa was more mature. Katia very often behaved\nsomewhat like a spoiled child, like she\u2019d just done. Of course, Sansa\nunderstood she was upset -she hardly left Camelot and this trip was already\nshort as it was -but she was old enough to know that tantrums just looked bad\nfor her.</p><p>She consoled Katia for a few\nminutes, letting her cry and say how it wasn\u2019t fair, then told her she would\nsend someone to help her pack. Sansa left to her own chambers to start her own\npacking, when Maggie came in and closed the door after herself.</p><p>\u201cLady Maggie\u2026\u201d Sansa started\ncarefully.</p><p>\u201cI do not have much time.\u201d Maggie\nsaid urgently. \u201cI rather say this here, because I am not so sure if I can say\nit in Camelot without someone hearing and reporting back to the King. Here I\nfeel a bit safer.\u201d</p><p>That shut Sansa up.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d Maggie admitted in\na rush. \u201cI took you to Londinium so you could meet Arthur. I swear that it was\nnever my intention that you would get lost or scared; the riot we saw was not\npart of the plan. I am sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this now?\u201d\nSansa wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThey think Vortigern plans on\nsacrificing you.\u201d Maggie told her directly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa was incredulous.</p><p>\u201cArthur asked for a lock of your\nhair, the Mage tested it. She believes he wants to sacrifice you for your\nbloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is preposterous!\u201d Sansa\nsnapped. \u201cSacrifice me? What type of person would\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cYou have heard the whispers.\u201d Maggie spoke firmly. \u201cYou know about the Tower\nand Vortigern\u2019s desperation to finish it. You cannot say you think it is all\nmadness.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a deep breath. \u201cBut why\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your lineage. I do not\nknow the details.\u201d Maggie admitted. \u201cBut they are sure this is what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have to believe in your word?\u201d\nSansa hissed at her.</p><p>\u201cI know it is difficult, and you\nhave no reason to believe me, Sansa, but I am being honest. If I wanted I could\nhave said nothing. And I am taking a great risk now, telling you that I have\ncontacts amongst the rebels. You could go straight to Vortigern and tell him\nall of this.\u201d</p><p>Why those things kept happening to\nher? She did not want to be involved in this\u2026</p><p>But then again\u2026 That was exactly\nwhat that prick had told her, wasn\u2019t it? She couldn\u2019t remain happily neutral,\npretending there wasn\u2019t a revolution happening out there, and that it could go\neither way at any given moment.</p><p>She would have to choose a side</p><p>\n\u201cI have to pack, Lady Maggie. You should go.\u201d</p><p>Maggie still opened her mouth, like\nshe intended to say more, but then she just nodded at Sansa and left.</p><p>XxX</p><p>This time they couldn\u2019t watch the\nparty moving. Mercia had come to pick the princess up and carry her back to\nCamelot, and he\u2019d brought guards along.</p><p>Besides, they didn\u2019t really need to\nwatch the whole parade, they knew where the princess was going, who she was\nwith, and that Vortigern wasn\u2019t anywhere near them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d Back Lack commented\nfrom his place beside Arthur.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking.\u201d Arthur commented in\na lower, tired voice.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\nThe other man snorted.</p><p>Arthur sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t start, Back\nLack. You have no idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got hooked by those pretty\neyes, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I know you better than anyone, I\u2019m not blind.\u201d\nBack Lack indicated as he got up. He put his hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJust\nremember: she belongs to him. Don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d He recommended,\nsqueezing Arthur\u2019s shoulder before leaving the man alone.</p><p>Arthur wouldn\u2019t even ask why Back\nLack had come to the conclusion that he had some type of interest in Lady\nSansa. He was right, he knew Arthur better than anyone.</p><p>But on one thing he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs to no one.\u201d</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa was spiraling; she was\npanicking. What if they were right? What if Vortigern was really intending to\nsacrifice her?</p><p>By all the Gods, how was this her\nlife? Would she ever get just a bit of peace? How come she was always falling into\nthe hands of crazy Kings that wanted to use her?</p><p>And what if Maggie was lying to her?\nHow could she trust the other woman?</p><p>Why this all so complicated?</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d grown less than she\nthought. Perhaps she still was that stupid little girl, the one that knew nothing\nand trusted all the wrong people.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady.\u201d A servant knocked on her\ndoor. \u201cThe King wishes to see you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded to the man and got up.\nWhat could Vortigern want with her? They had occasional conversations from time\nto time, but she\u2019d barely arrived back at Camelot.</p><p>She checked her appearance on the\nmirror than made her way to the King\u2019s solar. Vortigern was there alone,\nsitting behind his massive desk.</p><p>\u201cMy King.\u201d Sansa curtsied prettily.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, come closer.\u201d He told\nher softly.</p><p>Sansa started to feel distinctively\nlike prey; his eyes were fixed on her, cool and calculating. Vortigern was a good-looking\nman, but the more time she spent with him, the more he made her nervous in a\nway that was different from other men. Even when Sansa briefly thought he\nplanned on marrying her, she\u2019d never thought he actually <i>wanted</i> her; she was certain Vortigern didn\u2019t see her like a woman\nat all. Sometimes, when he looked at her, Sansa felt a visceral fear.</p><p>She felt like prey.</p><p><i>Sacrifice.</i></p><p>Oh no! It was not the time to let\nthose words -those absurd words -wreak havoc in her mind.</p><p>She walked up to his desk, unsure if\nshe looked as nervous as she felt.</p><p>\u201cI have talked to Lady Maggie.\u201d Vortigern\nsaid when she was close enough. \u201cAbout what happened in Londinium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an unfortunate event.\u201d Sansa\nspoke carefully.</p><p>\u201cI am not happy about it.\u201d He\ninformed her. \u201cYou are my guest, I cannot have you in dangerous situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not something we could have\npredict, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right.\u201d He gave in too\neasily. \u201cAn even better reason to not leave the keep at all.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was in a delicate situation\nnow. \u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201d She conceded. \u201cI truly apologize for any\nproblem I may have brought. I do not wish to be ungrateful after everything you\nhave done for me.\u201d She lowered her head, eyes on the ground.</p><p>The silence stretched for a whole\nminute, until the King decided to break it. \u201cI worry about you, Lady Sansa. I\nam just trying to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, My King.\u201d She replied\nquietly.</p><p>\u201cThere is someone out there, trying\nto destroy me; the so called born-king. I cannot have you or Katia out there,\nwhere he can do something to both of you.</p><p>\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>She risked a look in his direction.\nHe was looking intensely at her. \u201cHave you ever seen him?\u201d</p><p>She\ndidn\u2019t need to ask who he was talking about. \u201cNo, My King. I haven\u2019t seen\nanyone.\u201d</p><p>His\nmouth curled up on the right corner. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t lie to me, would you,\nSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nMy King.\u201d</p><p>He\nhummed under his breath. \u201cGo rest. You had a long trip and I would like to see\nyou for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nMy King.\u201d She curtsied.</p><p>She\nstarted leaving, then stopped. She shouldn\u2019t\u2026 It was a bad idea, but\u2026</p><p>\u201cMy\nKing?\u201d She turned back.</p><p>He\nhad been watching her leaving. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow it is not my place to ask anything of you, considering how generous you\nhave been all this time, but\u2026\u201d She bit her lower lip. \u201cWell\u2026 I have always\nwished to marry and have my own family; and now I am older\u2026 I was wondering\u2026\nWould you consider finding me a match?\u201d</p><p>The\nroom became so silent so suddenly that Sansa feared he could hear her heart\nbeating inside her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy\nare you asking this now, Lady Sansa?\u201d He finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow it is not something to be decided lightly, and it might take you some time\nto consider it.\u201d She replied carefully. \u201cSo I decided to ask you now, Your\nMajesty.\u201d</p><p>Vortigern\nwasn\u2019t blinking. \u201cI do not know if I want to part from you so soon, Lady Sansa.\u201d\nHe finally replied. \u201cYou are a great company for my daughter and I have no\nplans of marrying her yet. Do you have someone you wish to marry?\u201d The last\npart wasn\u2019t so much a question, as it was demand for the truth.</p><p>\u201cNot\nat this time, My King.\u201d She answered. \u201cI just wish\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare still young.\u201d He cut her. \u201cI do not wish to see you married so soon. This\nconversation is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nMy King. I am sorry for bothering you.\u201d</p><p>As\nSansa hurried away from him she started questioning everything she thought she\nknew. Was this really a simple question of Vortigern not wanting to marry her\nnow, or was there something else behind it?</p><p>Why\nwas she suddenly starting to believe in a man she\u2019d seen twice before?</p><p>And\nif he was right\u2026 What could she possibly do?</p><hr><p><b><i>(Notes: So for this chapter I took in consideration something I saw on the internet and I&rsquo;m almost sure it&rsquo;s actually official.

She heard a thousand times her kindness and graciousness should\nbe her biggest assets, and that a woman should turn her face away from\nviolence. She was never raised to be a fighter, she was supposed to have a\nfamily as soon as possible and care for that family. All the fighting should be\nleft to the men.</p><p>He spoke like she was in this\nsituation just because she wanted, as if it would be as simple as picking up a\nsword and she could go anywhere she wanted.</p><p>Men hardly ever understood.</p><p>\u201cThis is not fair!\u201d She heard Katia\nprotesting.</p><p>Sansa hurried down the stairs, only\nto find Mercia looking down at Katia. \u201cIt is what the King wishes, therefore,\nit shall happen.\u201d He informed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sansa asked,\nstanding by Katia.</p><p>\u201cMy father wants us back in\nCamelot!\u201d Katia cried, grabbing Sansa\u2019s arm. \u201cHe heard about some commotion in\nLondinium and now he wants me to go back. This is not fair!\u201d She insisted. \u201cI\nwas not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Lady Sansa and Lady Maggie\nwere.\u201d Mercia turned his eyes to Sansa, and she felt the accusation on them.\n\u201cNow, we cannot allow them to be in danger, can we?\u201d</p><p>Sansa cleared her throat. \u201cLord\nMercia, this is hardly necessary. Maybe we can stay a few more days, no more\nvisits to\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cThe King was clear.\u201d He cut her, without any respect. \u201cYou are going back to\nLondinium now.\u201d</p><p>Katia\u2019s eyes welled in tears, then\nshe stormed off to the bedroom she had been given.</p><p>Sansa turned to follow her, when\nMercia\u2019s voice stopped her. \u201cMake sure she packs fast, Lady Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had to control her expression\nas she nodded at him and followed Katia back to her room.</p><p>It was quite curious that, despite\nbeing older than Katia, Sansa was more mature. Katia very often behaved\nsomewhat like a spoiled child, like she\u2019d just done. Of course, Sansa\nunderstood she was upset -she hardly left Camelot and this trip was already\nshort as it was -but she was old enough to know that tantrums just looked bad\nfor her.</p><p>She consoled Katia for a few\nminutes, letting her cry and say how it wasn\u2019t fair, then told her she would\nsend someone to help her pack. Sansa left to her own chambers to start her own\npacking, when Maggie came in and closed the door after herself.</p><p>\u201cLady Maggie\u2026\u201d Sansa started\ncarefully.</p><p>\u201cI do not have much time.\u201d Maggie\nsaid urgently. \u201cI rather say this here, because I am not so sure if I can say\nit in Camelot without someone hearing and reporting back to the King. Here I\nfeel a bit safer.\u201d</p><p>That shut Sansa up.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d Maggie admitted in\na rush. \u201cI took you to Londinium so you could meet Arthur. I swear that it was\nnever my intention that you would get lost or scared; the riot we saw was not\npart of the plan. I am sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this now?\u201d\nSansa wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThey think Vortigern plans on\nsacrificing you.\u201d Maggie told her directly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa was incredulous.</p><p>\u201cArthur asked for a lock of your\nhair, the Mage tested it. She believes he wants to sacrifice you for your\nbloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is preposterous!\u201d Sansa\nsnapped. \u201cSacrifice me? What type of person would\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cYou have heard the whispers.\u201d Maggie spoke firmly. \u201cYou know about the Tower\nand Vortigern\u2019s desperation to finish it. You cannot say you think it is all\nmadness.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a deep breath. \u201cBut why\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your lineage. I do not\nknow the details.\u201d Maggie admitted. \u201cBut they are sure this is what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have to believe in your word?\u201d\nSansa hissed at her.</p><p>\u201cI know it is difficult, and you\nhave no reason to believe me, Sansa, but I am being honest. If I wanted I could\nhave said nothing. And I am taking a great risk now, telling you that I have\ncontacts amongst the rebels. You could go straight to Vortigern and tell him\nall of this.\u201d</p><p>Why those things kept happening to\nher? She did not want to be involved in this\u2026</p><p>But then again\u2026 That was exactly\nwhat that prick had told her, wasn\u2019t it? She couldn\u2019t remain happily neutral,\npretending there wasn\u2019t a revolution happening out there, and that it could go\neither way at any given moment.</p><p>She would have to choose a side</p><p>\n\u201cI have to pack, Lady Maggie. You should go.\u201d</p><p>Maggie still opened her mouth, like\nshe intended to say more, but then she just nodded at Sansa and left.</p><p>XxX</p><p>This time they couldn\u2019t watch the\nparty moving. Mercia had come to pick the princess up and carry her back to\nCamelot, and he\u2019d brought guards along.</p><p>Besides, they didn\u2019t really need to\nwatch the whole parade, they knew where the princess was going, who she was\nwith, and that Vortigern wasn\u2019t anywhere near them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d Back Lack commented\nfrom his place beside Arthur.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking.\u201d Arthur commented in\na lower, tired voice.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\nThe other man snorted.</p><p>Arthur sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t start, Back\nLack. You have no idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got hooked by those pretty\neyes, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I know you better than anyone, I\u2019m not blind.\u201d\nBack Lack indicated as he got up. He put his hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJust\nremember: she belongs to him. Don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d He recommended,\nsqueezing Arthur\u2019s shoulder before leaving the man alone.</p><p>Arthur wouldn\u2019t even ask why Back\nLack had come to the conclusion that he had some type of interest in Lady\nSansa. He was right, he knew Arthur better than anyone.</p><p>But on one thing he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs to no one.\u201d</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa was spiraling; she was\npanicking. What if they were right? What if Vortigern was really intending to\nsacrifice her?</p><p>By all the Gods, how was this her\nlife? Would she ever get just a bit of peace? How come she was always falling into\nthe hands of crazy Kings that wanted to use her?</p><p>And what if Maggie was lying to her?\nHow could she trust the other woman?</p><p>Why this all so complicated?</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d grown less than she\nthought. Perhaps she still was that stupid little girl, the one that knew nothing\nand trusted all the wrong people.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady.\u201d A servant knocked on her\ndoor. \u201cThe King wishes to see you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded to the man and got up.\nWhat could Vortigern want with her? They had occasional conversations from time\nto time, but she\u2019d barely arrived back at Camelot.</p><p>She checked her appearance on the\nmirror than made her way to the King\u2019s solar. Vortigern was there alone,\nsitting behind his massive desk.</p><p>\u201cMy King.\u201d Sansa curtsied prettily.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, come closer.\u201d He told\nher softly.</p><p>Sansa started to feel distinctively\nlike prey; his eyes were fixed on her, cool and calculating. Vortigern was a good-looking\nman, but the more time she spent with him, the more he made her nervous in a\nway that was different from other men. Even when Sansa briefly thought he\nplanned on marrying her, she\u2019d never thought he actually <i>wanted</i> her; she was certain Vortigern didn\u2019t see her like a woman\nat all. Sometimes, when he looked at her, Sansa felt a visceral fear.</p><p>She felt like prey.</p><p><i>Sacrifice.</i></p><p>Oh no! It was not the time to let\nthose words -those absurd words -wreak havoc in her mind.</p><p>She walked up to his desk, unsure if\nshe looked as nervous as she felt.</p><p>\u201cI have talked to Lady Maggie.\u201d Vortigern\nsaid when she was close enough. \u201cAbout what happened in Londinium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an unfortunate event.\u201d Sansa\nspoke carefully.</p><p>\u201cI am not happy about it.\u201d He\ninformed her. \u201cYou are my guest, I cannot have you in dangerous situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not something we could have\npredict, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right.\u201d He gave in too\neasily. \u201cAn even better reason to not leave the keep at all.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was in a delicate situation\nnow. \u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201d She conceded. \u201cI truly apologize for any\nproblem I may have brought. I do not wish to be ungrateful after everything you\nhave done for me.\u201d She lowered her head, eyes on the ground.</p><p>The silence stretched for a whole\nminute, until the King decided to break it. \u201cI worry about you, Lady Sansa. I\nam just trying to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, My King.\u201d She replied\nquietly.</p><p>\u201cThere is someone out there, trying\nto destroy me; the so called born-king. I cannot have you or Katia out there,\nwhere he can do something to both of you.</p><p>\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>She risked a look in his direction.\nHe was looking intensely at her. \u201cHave you ever seen him?\u201d</p><p>She\ndidn\u2019t need to ask who he was talking about. \u201cNo, My King. I haven\u2019t seen\nanyone.\u201d</p><p>His\nmouth curled up on the right corner. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t lie to me, would you,\nSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nMy King.\u201d</p><p>He\nhummed under his breath. \u201cGo rest. You had a long trip and I would like to see\nyou for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nMy King.\u201d She curtsied.</p><p>She\nstarted leaving, then stopped. She shouldn\u2019t\u2026 It was a bad idea, but\u2026</p><p>\u201cMy\nKing?\u201d She turned back.</p><p>He\nhad been watching her leaving. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow it is not my place to ask anything of you, considering how generous you\nhave been all this time, but\u2026\u201d She bit her lower lip. \u201cWell\u2026 I have always\nwished to marry and have my own family; and now I am older\u2026 I was wondering\u2026\nWould you consider finding me a match?\u201d</p><p>The\nroom became so silent so suddenly that Sansa feared he could hear her heart\nbeating inside her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy\nare you asking this now, Lady Sansa?\u201d He finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow it is not something to be decided lightly, and it might take you some time\nto consider it.\u201d She replied carefully. \u201cSo I decided to ask you now, Your\nMajesty.\u201d</p><p>Vortigern\nwasn\u2019t blinking. \u201cI do not know if I want to part from you so soon, Lady Sansa.\u201d\nHe finally replied. \u201cYou are a great company for my daughter and I have no\nplans of marrying her yet. Do you have someone you wish to marry?\u201d The last\npart wasn\u2019t so much a question, as it was demand for the truth.</p><p>\u201cNot\nat this time, My King.\u201d She answered. \u201cI just wish\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare still young.\u201d He cut her. \u201cI do not wish to see you married so soon. This\nconversation is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nMy King. I am sorry for bothering you.\u201d</p><p>As\nSansa hurried away from him she started questioning everything she thought she\nknew. Was this really a simple question of Vortigern not wanting to marry her\nnow, or was there something else behind it?</p><p>Why\nwas she suddenly starting to believe in a man she\u2019d seen twice before?</p><p>And\nif he was right\u2026 What could she possibly do?</p><hr><p><b><i>(Notes: So for this chapter I took in consideration something I saw on the internet and I\u2019m almost sure it\u2019s actually official. Supposedly, G.R.R. Martin said that all the Stark children had the hability to warg, but Sansa lost Lady before she could discover this.

However\u2026\u201d Now she finally looked\nat the others. \u201cIt is too powerful for it not to manifest in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManifest?\u201d Rubio repeated, curious.</p><p>\u201cYes. Even if she is not trained,\nmagic this intense finds a way to get out.\u201d The mage explained. \u201cShe should\nhave some peculiar talent. In cases like these, it normally is having visions\nof the future, healing powers or even talking to animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone would know if she had any\nof these gifts, no?\u201d Bill commented.</p><p>Someone snorted. They all turned to\nfind the women rolling their eyes at Bill.</p><p>\u201cSomething we missed, ladies?\u201d\nBedivere asked politely.</p><p>Ada, who was only a bit older than Arthur,\nbut had helped raising him, gave Bedivere a flat look. \u201cSomeone would know? Has\nit occurred to you that, if she can do any of those things, she is very likely\nto keep very quiet about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rubio was confused.</p><p>The women groaned in frustration.\n\u201cWet Stick, what happened to Daisy when she was accused of witchcraft last\nyear, for no reason other than the fact she was a good healer?\u201d Sigrid asked.</p><p>Wet Stick winced. \u201cShe was taken by\nthe soldiers and we never saw her again.\u201d He told the others.</p><p>\u201cWomen with \u2018gifts\u2019 are hardly ever\nwell seen.\u201d Ada told Bedivere. \u201cBeing a noble lady might give her some\nprotection, but she would never tell people. I don\u2019t believe Westeros is that\ndifferent from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is right.\u201d The Mage called.\n\u201cThere is a chance she might not even know she has gifts, but if she does\u2026 She\nhas no reason to tell people. Especially if she has a story as tragic as she supposedly\ndoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he will do to\nher?\u201d Arthur spoke for the first time since it all had started.</p><p>His body was tense, his jaw locked.\nBedivere and Bill traded looks, but refrained from commenting at that moment.</p><p>\u201cHe is going to sacrifice her.\u201d The\nMage spoke, full of conviction. \u201cHe would never use her for anything else;\nshe\u2019s perfect: noble blood, magic, virgin\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that last part?\u201d Back Lack asked confused.</p><p>\u201cThe hair told me all I needed to\nknow.\u201d She informed him.</p><p>The man made a disgruntled face,\nmaking Wet Stick and Percival snort.</p><p>\u201cThis is easy to fix.\u201d Bill suddenly\nsaid.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Rubio asked.</p><p>\u201cIf he needs a virgin sacrifice, and\nshe is not a virgin anymore\u2026\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to finish the\nthought, they\u2019d all understood it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Judith, another one of the\ngirls, drawled. \u201cBecause it will be very simple to go to a noble lady and tell\nher she needs to sleep with someone for the sake of England.\u201d She finished\ndryly.</p><p>\n\u201cBecause I expect that is what you\u2019re suggesting right there, Bill.\u201d Arthur\nsaid, his voice deadly cold.</p><p>Bill arched a brow. \u201cI expect you\nknow me well enough to be aware that it is, in fact, what I am suggesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us take a deep breath, mates.\u201d\nBack Lack put his hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLadies, what do you think we\nshould do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good time to just\ntell her the truth.\u201d Ada offered. \u201cIf she feels you lot are hiding something\nfrom her, she might be more inclined to believe in the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Sarah, another of the\ngirls nodded. \u201cGet Maggie to tell her the truth, she might like us a bit more\nthan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s on his side already?\u201d\nArthur pointed out. \u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t believe us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to take the risk.\u201d The Mage\nanswered from her place. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to let him have her. If she won\u2019t\nbelieve us\u2026 We will need to do something about it.\u201d</p><p>Arthur took a deep breath. \u201cSo\nyou\u2019re suggesting we kill her if she doesn\u2019t believe us.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either her or England.\u201d The\nMage indicated simply. \u201cWhich one would you choose?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even need to answer that.</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa hadn\u2019t slept after Arthur\nleft; she hadn\u2019t managed to even close her eyes. He\u2019d scared her, badly. For\nall this time she\u2019d been living in England, she\u2019d tried to forget everything\nthat happened to her in Westeros, she tried to convince herself it wasn\u2019t her\nlife anymore.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been so na\u00efve.\nAgain.</p><p>She didn\u2019t question Vortigern\nmotives, and she should have. By now she knew the King well enough to know he\nwould never have brought her to Camelot if he didn\u2019t have a plan for her.\nHowever, she chose to pretend he was just bored or something, and that he just wanted\na companion for his daughter.</p><p>She had been willingly blind;\nVortigern could get a thousand girls to keep Katia company without even walking\nfar. He had no reason to need specifically her, he had no reason to trouble\nhimself with bringing her all the way from King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Which meant he wanted something.</p><p>After her first year there, Sansa\nhad started thinking Vortigern wanted to either marry her himself or marry her\noff to someone else. He was extremely protective of her, and many of the guards\nwouldn\u2019t talk or even look at her. She thought he was saving her for some\nreason and the only logical one was marriage.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Now she was not so sure anymore. To\nbe honest, since that damned day that Arthur came into her way she wasn\u2019t sure\nof anything anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d destroyed her peace and he was\nstill doing it.</p><p>For a man like him it was easy to\nsay she just needed to fight back and be her own hero. He was raised to fight,\nand believe that because he could carry a sword the world was his for the\ntaking. He grew up knowing his strength would be measured by what he could do\nwith said sword, and that men would respect him if he was bigger and meaner\nthan the others.</p><p>Sansa had been raised to be a wife\nand a mother. She heard a thousand times her kindness and graciousness should\nbe her biggest assets, and that a woman should turn her face away from\nviolence. She was never raised to be a fighter, she was supposed to have a\nfamily as soon as possible and care for that family. All the fighting should be\nleft to the men.</p><p>He spoke like she was in this\nsituation just because she wanted, as if it would be as simple as picking up a\nsword and she could go anywhere she wanted.</p><p>Men hardly ever understood.</p><p>\u201cThis is not fair!\u201d She heard Katia\nprotesting.</p><p>Sansa hurried down the stairs, only\nto find Mercia looking down at Katia. \u201cIt is what the King wishes, therefore,\nit shall happen.\u201d He informed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sansa asked,\nstanding by Katia.</p><p>\u201cMy father wants us back in\nCamelot!\u201d Katia cried, grabbing Sansa\u2019s arm. \u201cHe heard about some commotion in\nLondinium and now he wants me to go back. This is not fair!\u201d She insisted. \u201cI\nwas not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Lady Sansa and Lady Maggie\nwere.\u201d Mercia turned his eyes to Sansa, and she felt the accusation on them.\n\u201cNow, we cannot allow them to be in danger, can we?\u201d</p><p>Sansa cleared her throat. \u201cLord\nMercia, this is hardly necessary. Maybe we can stay a few more days, no more\nvisits to\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cThe King was clear.\u201d He cut her, without any respect. \u201cYou are going back to\nLondinium now.\u201d</p><p>Katia\u2019s eyes welled in tears, then\nshe stormed off to the bedroom she had been given.</p><p>Sansa turned to follow her, when\nMercia\u2019s voice stopped her. \u201cMake sure she packs fast, Lady Sansa.\u201d</p><p>Sansa had to control her expression\nas she nodded at him and followed Katia back to her room.</p><p>It was quite curious that, despite\nbeing older than Katia, Sansa was more mature. Katia very often behaved\nsomewhat like a spoiled child, like she\u2019d just done. Of course, Sansa\nunderstood she was upset -she hardly left Camelot and this trip was already\nshort as it was -but she was old enough to know that tantrums just looked bad\nfor her.</p><p>She consoled Katia for a few\nminutes, letting her cry and say how it wasn\u2019t fair, then told her she would\nsend someone to help her pack. Sansa left to her own chambers to start her own\npacking, when Maggie came in and closed the door after herself.</p><p>\u201cLady Maggie\u2026\u201d Sansa started\ncarefully.</p><p>\u201cI do not have much time.\u201d Maggie\nsaid urgently. \u201cI rather say this here, because I am not so sure if I can say\nit in Camelot without someone hearing and reporting back to the King. Here I\nfeel a bit safer.\u201d</p><p>That shut Sansa up.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d Maggie admitted in\na rush. \u201cI took you to Londinium so you could meet Arthur. I swear that it was\nnever my intention that you would get lost or scared; the riot we saw was not\npart of the plan. I am sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this now?\u201d\nSansa wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThey think Vortigern plans on\nsacrificing you.\u201d Maggie told her directly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa was incredulous.</p><p>\u201cArthur asked for a lock of your\nhair, the Mage tested it. She believes he wants to sacrifice you for your\nbloodline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is preposterous!\u201d Sansa\nsnapped. \u201cSacrifice me? What type of person would\u2026</p><p>\n\u201cYou have heard the whispers.\u201d Maggie spoke firmly. \u201cYou know about the Tower\nand Vortigern\u2019s desperation to finish it. You cannot say you think it is all\nmadness.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a deep breath. \u201cBut why\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your lineage. I do not\nknow the details.\u201d Maggie admitted. \u201cBut they are sure this is what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have to believe in your word?\u201d\nSansa hissed at her.</p><p>\u201cI know it is difficult, and you\nhave no reason to believe me, Sansa, but I am being honest. If I wanted I could\nhave said nothing. And I am taking a great risk now, telling you that I have\ncontacts amongst the rebels. You could go straight to Vortigern and tell him\nall of this.\u201d</p><p>Why those things kept happening to\nher? She did not want to be involved in this\u2026</p><p>But then again\u2026 That was exactly\nwhat that prick had told her, wasn\u2019t it? She couldn\u2019t remain happily neutral,\npretending there wasn\u2019t a revolution happening out there, and that it could go\neither way at any given moment.</p><p>She would have to choose a side</p><p>\n\u201cI have to pack, Lady Maggie. You should go.\u201d</p><p>Maggie still opened her mouth, like\nshe intended to say more, but then she just nodded at Sansa and left.</p><p>XxX</p><p>This time they couldn\u2019t watch the\nparty moving. Mercia had come to pick the princess up and carry her back to\nCamelot, and he\u2019d brought guards along.</p><p>Besides, they didn\u2019t really need to\nwatch the whole parade, they knew where the princess was going, who she was\nwith, and that Vortigern wasn\u2019t anywhere near them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d Back Lack commented\nfrom his place beside Arthur.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking.\u201d Arthur commented in\na lower, tired voice.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\nThe other man snorted.</p><p>Arthur sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t start, Back\nLack. You have no idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got hooked by those pretty\neyes, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I know you better than anyone, I\u2019m not blind.\u201d\nBack Lack indicated as he got up. He put his hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJust\nremember: she belongs to him. Don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d He recommended,\nsqueezing Arthur\u2019s shoulder before leaving the man alone.</p><p>Arthur wouldn\u2019t even ask why Back\nLack had come to the conclusion that he had some type of interest in Lady\nSansa. He was right, he knew Arthur better than anyone.</p><p>But on one thing he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs to no one.\u201d</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa was spiraling; she was\npanicking. What if they were right? What if Vortigern was really intending to\nsacrifice her?</p><p>By all the Gods, how was this her\nlife? Would she ever get just a bit of peace? How come she was always falling into\nthe hands of crazy Kings that wanted to use her?</p><p>And what if Maggie was lying to her?\nHow could she trust the other woman?</p><p>Why this all so complicated?</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d grown less than she\nthought. Perhaps she still was that stupid little girl, the one that knew nothing\nand trusted all the wrong people.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady.\u201d A servant knocked on her\ndoor. \u201cThe King wishes to see you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nodded to the man and got up.\nWhat could Vortigern want with her? They had occasional conversations from time\nto time, but she\u2019d barely arrived back at Camelot.</p><p>She checked her appearance on the\nmirror than made her way to the King\u2019s solar. Vortigern was there alone,\nsitting behind his massive desk.</p><p>\u201cMy King.\u201d Sansa curtsied prettily.</p><p>\u201cLady Sansa, come closer.\u201d He told\nher softly.</p><p>Sansa started to feel distinctively\nlike prey; his eyes were fixed on her, cool and calculating. Vortigern was a good-looking\nman, but the more time she spent with him, the more he made her nervous in a\nway that was different from other men. Even when Sansa briefly thought he\nplanned on marrying her, she\u2019d never thought he actually <i>wanted</i> her; she was certain Vortigern didn\u2019t see her like a woman\nat all. Sometimes, when he looked at her, Sansa felt a visceral fear.</p><p>She felt like prey.</p><p><i>Sacrifice.</i></p><p>Oh no! It was not the time to let\nthose words -those absurd words -wreak havoc in her mind.</p><p>She walked up to his desk, unsure if\nshe looked as nervous as she felt.</p><p>\u201cI have talked to Lady Maggie.\u201d Vortigern\nsaid when she was close enough. \u201cAbout what happened in Londinium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an unfortunate event.\u201d Sansa\nspoke carefully.</p><p>\u201cI am not happy about it.\u201d He\ninformed her. \u201cYou are my guest, I cannot have you in dangerous situations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not something we could have\npredict, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right.\u201d He gave in too\neasily. \u201cAn even better reason to not leave the keep at all.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was in a delicate situation\nnow. \u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201d She conceded. \u201cI truly apologize for any\nproblem I may have brought. I do not wish to be ungrateful after everything you\nhave done for me.\u201d She lowered her head, eyes on the ground.</p><p>The silence stretched for a whole\nminute, until the King decided to break it. \u201cI worry about you, Lady Sansa. I\nam just trying to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, My King.\u201d She replied\nquietly.</p><p>\u201cThere is someone out there, trying\nto destroy me; the so called born-king. I cannot have you or Katia out there,\nwhere he can do something to both of you.</p><p>\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>She risked a look in his direction.\nHe was looking intensely at her. \u201cHave you ever seen him?\u201d</p><p>She\ndidn\u2019t need to ask who he was talking about. \u201cNo, My King. I haven\u2019t seen\nanyone.\u201d</p><p>His\nmouth curled up on the right corner. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t lie to me, would you,\nSansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nMy King.\u201d</p><p>He\nhummed under his breath. \u201cGo rest. You had a long trip and I would like to see\nyou for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nMy King.\u201d She curtsied.</p><p>She\nstarted leaving, then stopped. She shouldn\u2019t\u2026 It was a bad idea, but\u2026</p><p>\u201cMy\nKing?\u201d She turned back.</p><p>He\nhad been watching her leaving. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow it is not my place to ask anything of you, considering how generous you\nhave been all this time, but\u2026\u201d She bit her lower lip. \u201cWell\u2026 I have always\nwished to marry and have my own family; and now I am older\u2026 I was wondering\u2026\nWould you consider finding me a match?\u201d</p><p>The\nroom became so silent so suddenly that Sansa feared he could hear her heart\nbeating inside her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy\nare you asking this now, Lady Sansa?\u201d He finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI\nknow it is not something to be decided lightly, and it might take you some time\nto consider it.\u201d She replied carefully. \u201cSo I decided to ask you now, Your\nMajesty.\u201d</p><p>Vortigern\nwasn\u2019t blinking. \u201cI do not know if I want to part from you so soon, Lady Sansa.\u201d\nHe finally replied. \u201cYou are a great company for my daughter and I have no\nplans of marrying her yet. Do you have someone you wish to marry?\u201d The last\npart wasn\u2019t so much a question, as it was demand for the truth.</p><p>\u201cNot\nat this time, My King.\u201d She answered. \u201cI just wish\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare still young.\u201d He cut her. \u201cI do not wish to see you married so soon. This\nconversation is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nMy King. I am sorry for bothering you.\u201d</p><p>As\nSansa hurried away from him she started questioning everything she thought she\nknew. Was this really a simple question of Vortigern not wanting to marry her\nnow, or was there something else behind it?</p><p>Why\nwas she suddenly starting to believe in a man she\u2019d seen twice before?</p><p>And\nif he was right\u2026 What could she possibly do?</p><hr><p><b><i>(Notes: So for this chapter I took in consideration something I saw on the internet and I\u2019m almost sure it\u2019s actually official.

However&hellip;&rdquo; Now she finally looked\nat the others. &ldquo;It is too powerful for it not to manifest in some way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Manifest?&rdquo; Rubio repeated, curious.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Even if she is not trained,\nmagic this intense finds a way to get out.&rdquo; The mage explained. &ldquo;She should\nhave some peculiar talent.

They all turned to\nfind the women rolling their eyes at Bill.</p><p>&ldquo;Something we missed, ladies?&rdquo;\nBedivere asked politely.</p><p>Ada, who was only a bit older than Arthur,\nbut had helped raising him, gave Bedivere a flat look. &ldquo;Someone would know?

He had no reason to need specifically her, he had no reason to trouble\nhimself with bringing her all the way from King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><p>Which meant he wanted something.</p><p>After her first year there, Sansa\nhad started thinking Vortigern wanted to either marry her himself or marry her\noff to someone else. He was extremely protective of her, and many of the guards\nwouldn&rsquo;t talk or even look at her.

You could go straight to Vortigern and tell him\nall of this.&rdquo;</p><p>Why those things kept happening to\nher? She did not want to be involved in this&hellip;</p><p>But then again&hellip; That was exactly\nwhat that prick had told her, wasn&rsquo;t it? She couldn&rsquo;t remain happily neutral,\npretending there wasn&rsquo;t a revolution happening out there, and that it could go\neither way at any given moment.</p><p>She would have to choose a side</p><p>\n&ldquo;I have to pack, Lady Maggie. You should go.&rdquo;</p><p>Maggie still opened her mouth, like\nshe intended to say more, but then she just nodded at Sansa and left.</p><p>XxX</p><p>This time they couldn&rsquo;t watch the\nparty moving. Mercia had come to pick the princess up and carry her back to\nCamelot, and he&rsquo;d brought guards along.</p><p>Besides, they didn&rsquo;t really need to\nwatch the whole parade, they knew where the princess was going, who she was\nwith, and that Vortigern wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near them.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quiet.&rdquo; Back Lack commented\nfrom his place beside Arthur.</p><p>&ldquo;Just thinking.&rdquo; Arthur commented in\na lower, tired voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking about.&rdquo;\nThe other man snorted.</p><p>Arthur sighed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start, Back\nLack. You have no idea&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got hooked by those pretty\neyes, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. I know you better than anyone, I&rsquo;m not blind.&rdquo;\nBack Lack indicated as he got up. He put his hand on Arthur&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Just\nremember: she belongs to him. Don&rsquo;t do anything stupid.&rdquo; He recommended,\nsqueezing Arthur&rsquo;s shoulder before leaving the man alone.</p><p>Arthur wouldn&rsquo;t even ask why Back\nLack had come to the conclusion that he had some type of interest in Lady\nSansa. He was right, he knew Arthur better than anyone.</p><p>But on one thing he was wrong.</p><p>&ldquo;She belongs to no one.&rdquo;</p><p>XxX</p><p>Sansa was spiraling; she was\npanicking. What if they were right? What if Vortigern was really intending to\nsacrifice her?</p><p>By all the Gods, how was this her\nlife? Would she ever get just a bit of peace? How come she was always falling into\nthe hands of crazy Kings that wanted to use her?</p><p>And what if Maggie was lying to her?\nHow could she trust the other woman?</p><p>Why this all so complicated?</p><p>Maybe she&rsquo;d grown less than she\nthought. Perhaps she still was that stupid little girl, the one that knew nothing\nand trusted all the wrong people.</p><p>&ldquo;My Lady.&rdquo; A servant knocked on her\ndoor. &ldquo;The King wishes to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa nodded to the man and got up.\nWhat could Vortigern want with her? They had occasional conversations from time\nto time, but she&rsquo;d barely arrived back at Camelot.</p><p>She checked her appearance on the\nmirror than made her way to the King&rsquo;s solar. Vortigern was there alone,\nsitting behind his massive desk.</p><p>&ldquo;My King.&rdquo; Sansa curtsied prettily.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Sansa, come closer.&rdquo; He told\nher softly.</p><p>Sansa started to feel distinctively\nlike prey; his eyes were fixed on her, cool and calculating. Vortigern was a good-looking\nman, but the more time she spent with him, the more he made her nervous in a\nway that was different from other men. Even when Sansa briefly thought he\nplanned on marrying her, she&rsquo;d never thought he actually <i>wanted</i> her; she was certain Vortigern didn&rsquo;t see her like a woman\nat all. Sometimes, when he looked at her, Sansa felt a visceral fear.</p><p>She felt like prey.</p><p><i>Sacrifice.</i></p><p>Oh no! It was not the time to let\nthose words -those absurd words -wreak havoc in her mind.</p><p>She walked up to his desk, unsure if\nshe looked as nervous as she felt.</p><p>&ldquo;I have talked to Lady Maggie.&rdquo; Vortigern\nsaid when she was close enough. &ldquo;About what happened in Londinium.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was an unfortunate event.&rdquo; Sansa\nspoke carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not happy about it.&rdquo; He\ninformed her. &ldquo;You are my guest, I cannot have you in dangerous situations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was not something we could have\npredict, Your Majesty&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right.&rdquo; He gave in too\neasily. &ldquo;An even better reason to not leave the keep at all.&rdquo;</p><p>She knew she was in a delicate situation\nnow. &ldquo;Of course, Your Majesty.&rdquo; She conceded. &ldquo;I truly apologize for any\nproblem I may have brought. I do not wish to be ungrateful after everything you\nhave done for me.&rdquo; She lowered her head, eyes on the ground.</p><p>The silence stretched for a whole\nminute, until the King decided to break it. &ldquo;I worry about you, Lady Sansa. I\nam just trying to keep you safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, My King.&rdquo; She replied\nquietly.</p><p>&ldquo;There is someone out there, trying\nto destroy me; the so called born-king. I cannot have you or Katia out there,\nwhere he can do something to both of you.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yes, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p><p>She risked a look in his direction.\nHe was looking intensely at her. &ldquo;Have you ever seen him?&rdquo;</p><p>She\ndidn&rsquo;t need to ask who he was talking about. &ldquo;No, My King. I haven&rsquo;t seen\nanyone.&rdquo;</p><p>His\nmouth curled up on the right corner. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t lie to me, would you,\nSansa?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,\nMy King.&rdquo;</p><p>He\nhummed under his breath. &ldquo;Go rest. You had a long trip and I would like to see\nyou for supper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nMy King.&rdquo; She curtsied.</p><p>She\nstarted leaving, then stopped. She shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip; It was a bad idea, but&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;My\nKing?&rdquo; She turned back.</p><p>He\nhad been watching her leaving. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow it is not my place to ask anything of you, considering how generous you\nhave been all this time, but&hellip;&rdquo; She bit her lower lip. &ldquo;Well&hellip; I have always\nwished to marry and have my own family; and now I am older&hellip; I was wondering&hellip;\nWould you consider finding me a match?&rdquo;</p><p>The\nroom became so silent so suddenly that Sansa feared he could hear her heart\nbeating inside her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Why\nare you asking this now, Lady Sansa?&rdquo; He finally asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I\nknow it is not something to be decided lightly, and it might take you some time\nto consider it.&rdquo; She replied carefully. &ldquo;So I decided to ask you now, Your\nMajesty.&rdquo;</p><p>Vortigern\nwasn&rsquo;t blinking. &ldquo;I do not know if I want to part from you so soon, Lady Sansa.&rdquo;\nHe finally replied. &ldquo;You are a great company for my daughter and I have no\nplans of marrying her yet. Do you have someone you wish to marry?&rdquo; The last\npart wasn&rsquo;t so much a question, as it was demand for the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;Not\nat this time, My King.&rdquo; She answered. &ldquo;I just wish&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nare still young.&rdquo; He cut her. &ldquo;I do not wish to see you married so soon. This\nconversation is done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,\nMy King. I am sorry for bothering you.&rdquo;</p><p>As\nSansa hurried away from him she started questioning everything she thought she\nknew. Was this really a simple question of Vortigern not wanting to marry her\nnow, or was there something else behind it?</p><p>Why\nwas she suddenly starting to believe in a man she&rsquo;d seen twice before?</p><p>And\nif he was right&hellip; What could she possibly do?</p><hr /><p><b><i>(Notes: So for this chapter I took in consideration something I saw on the internet and I&rsquo;m almost sure it&rsquo;s actually official. Supposedly, G.R.R. Martin said that all the Stark children had the hability to warg, but Sansa lost Lady before she could discover this. The Starks descent from the First Men, so I&rsquo;m basically using all of that as justification for Sansa&rsquo;s magic blood.

Let&rsquo;s see:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;As you command, Mother.&rdquo; King Jaehaerys pulled his sister closer and put his arm around her. &ldquo;But do not think that you shall unmake this marriage. <b>We are one now, and neither gods nor men shall part us.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; his bride affirmed. </b>&ldquo;Send me to the ends of the earth and wed me to the King of Mossovy or the Lord of the Grey Waste, Silverwing will always bring me back to Jaehaerys.&rdquo; And with that <b>she raised herself onto her toes and lifted her face to the king, and he kissed her full upon the lips whilst all looked on.&rdquo;</b><br /></i></p><p><i>(&hellip;)</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It is written that the young king and queen were seldom apart during that time, <b>sharing every meal, talking late into the night of the green days of their childhood and the challenges ahead, fishing and hawking together, mingling with the island&rsquo;s smallfolk in dockside inns, reading to one another from dusty leatherbound tomes they found in the castle library, taking lessons together from Dragonstone&rsquo;s maesters (&ldquo;for we still have much to learn,&rdquo; Alysanne is said to have reminded her husband), praying beside Septon Oswyck. They flew together as well,</b> all around the Dragonmont and oft as far as Driftmark.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>(&hellip;)</i></p><p><i>Every morning Jaehaerys trained with them in the castle yard, shouting at them to come at him harder, to press him, harry him, and attack him in every way they knew. <b>From sunrise till noon he worked with them, honing his skills with sword and spear and mace and axe whilst his new queen looked on.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>(&hellip;)</i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Jaehaerys was oft brusied and bloody by evening, to Alysanne&rsquo;s distress, </b>but his prowess improved so markedly&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>&mdash;Fire &amp; Blood&nbsp;</b><br /></p></blockquote><p>This is the kind of songs and stories Sansa grew up reading. This is the kind of&nbsp;songs and stories Sansa wishes to live. <i>An Idyll</i> where&nbsp;<i>love conquers all:</i></p><blockquote><p><i><i>&ldquo;Queen Alysanne, for her part, was in no haste to return to court. <b>&ldquo;Here I have you to myself, day and night,&rdquo; she told Jaehaerys. &ldquo;When we go back, I shall be fortunate to snatch an hour with you, for every man in Westeros will want a piece of you.&rdquo;</b> For her, <b>these days on Dragonstone were an idyll. </b>&ldquo;Many years from now when we are old and grey, <b>we shall look back upon these days and smile, remembering how happy we were.&rdquo;</b></i></i>&nbsp;</p><p><b>&mdash;Fire &amp; Blood&nbsp;</b></p></blockquote></p>",

And Cersei is trying to\npass some Queenly wisdom to Sansa and educate her about how to act in a moment like\nthis. Sansa may be very young and na\u00efve, but she still able to listen to what\nCersei is saying and understand that this may not be the best way to deal with\nher subjects. She already understand \u00a0that love it\u2019s a stronger tool to build\nbridges than fear and abuse. </p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"339\" data-orig-width=\"602\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eeef6c97608b78f7b7b29d5b21956dd3/tumblr_inline_pj4kwutJqa1sgp768_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"339\" data-orig-width=\"602\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Then, literally, on the next Sansa chapter (Sansa VII,\nchapter 62) we have Sansa once again raising above the bar and acting like a\nQueen, the Queen Cersei was never able to be. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Get out of my way.&rdquo; Cersei slammed her open palm\ninto his wound. Ser Lancel cried out in pain and almost fainted as the queen\nswept from the room. She spared Sansa not so much as a glance. She&rsquo;s forgotten\nme. Ser Ilyn will kill me and she won&rsquo;t even think about it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, gods,&rdquo; an old woman wailed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost,\nthe battle&rsquo;s lost, she&rsquo;s running.&rdquo; Several children were crying. They can\nsmell the fear. Sansa found herself alone on the dais. Should she stay here, or\nrun after the queen and plead for her life?</p><p><b>She never knew why she got to her feet, but she did.\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; she told them loudly. &ldquo;The queen has raised\nthe drawbridge. This is the safest place in the city. There&rsquo;s thick walls, the\nmoat, the spikes &hellip;&rdquo;</b></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; demanded a woman she knew\nslightly, the wife of a lesser lordling. &ldquo;What did Osney tell her? Is the\nking hurt, has the city fallen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; someone else shouted. One woman asked\nabout her father, another her son.</p><p><b>Sansa raised her hands for quiet. &ldquo;Joffrey&rsquo;s come back\nto the castle. He&rsquo;s not hurt. They&rsquo;re still fighting, that&rsquo;s all I know,\nthey&rsquo;re fighting bravely. The queen will be back soon.&rdquo; The last was a\nlie, but she had to soothe them. She noticed the fools standing under the\ngalley. &ldquo;Moon Boy, make us laugh.&rdquo;</b></p><p>Moon Boy did a cartwheel, and vaulted on top of a table. He\ngrabbed up four wine cups and began to juggle them. Every so often one of them\nwould come down and smash him in the head. A few nervous laughs echoed through\nthe hall. Sansa went to Ser Lancel and knelt beside him. His wound was bleeding\nafresh where the queen had struck him. &ldquo;Madness,&rdquo; he gasped.\n&ldquo;Gods, the Imp was right, was right &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Help him,&rdquo; Sansa commanded two of the serving\nmen.</b> One just looked at her and ran, flagon and all. Other servants were\nleaving the hall as well, but she could not help that. <b>Together, Sansa and the\nserving man got the wounded knight back on his feet. </b>&ldquo;Take him to Maester\nFrenken.&rdquo; Lancel was one of them, yet somehow she still could not bring\nherself to wish him dead. <b>I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says.\nI should be killing him, not helping him.</b></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Cersei its gone and Sansa takes over her duties and starts literally to act like the queen in charge, without anyone having to tell her what to do.\u00a0</p><p>Once again, George is telling us how much potential Sansa has to be a queen and the interesting thing about this momment is that is a extremelly stressfull and dramatic night. Sansa no even knows if she will survive this battle. Its easy to play the Queen role during a feast, or when you have people bending the knee to you and making songs about your beauty, but to perform your duty when the world is falling apart, thats the real test and Sansa passed with high scores.</p><p><br/></p><p>I said before in another forum and I will say again, some characters on ASOIAF like to scream over, over and over to the whole world that they are queens, others just act like one&hellip;.</p>",
