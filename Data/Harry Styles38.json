It&rsquo;s when Harry&rsquo;s plane will land.</p><p>However the older boy wanted to go to the airport to welcome his boyfriend, he couldn&rsquo;t.

Salty tears started to form in his eyes, and as much as he didn&rsquo;t want to cry, he let them stream down on his face. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know how much time had passed by, but he heard his friends calling his name.</p><p>&ldquo; Niall, man.. &rdquo; they said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo; What is it guys? &rdquo; He wiped off the tears from his face.</p><p>&ldquo; Your boy is.. &rdquo; His friends started to speak, but a heavy bag was heard to put down in the hallway.</p><p>Niall turned his head to the the noise, and when he saw his boyfriend with a bunch of roses in his hand, the Irish boy got up quickly from the couch, and ran to his boyfriend arms immediately, almost slipping on the carpet.</p><p>Niall didn&rsquo;t care about his friends saying <i>slow down mate</i> shouts, Niall just wanted to hold his boyfriend forever in his arms.</p><p>Like a kid, Niall jumped on Harry, which made the roses fall out from his hand.

When the time will come to tell the world who they really are, everybody will realize that these two were together since the very beginning.</p><p>Although in the past months, they started to give signs, and the people who had some clue about them, started to catch up.</p><p>It was five minutes past seven, and Niall started to get more nervous. He had some bad thoughs running inside his head.</p><p><i>What if fans attacked him at the airport?</i> No, it couldn&rsquo;t be, Harry can take care of himself.</p><p><i>&ldquo; But what if, if something really happened to him?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo; What if he had some trouble during his way to the airport? What if his flight got delayed? What if he wasn&rsquo;t on the plane? What if he missed his flight? What if he doesn&rsquo;t want to see me? What if he doesn&rsquo;t lo..&rdquo;</i></p><p>Niall&rsquo;s hands started to shaking, his heart started to hurt at his last thoughts.</p><p><i>&ldquo; No, Harry loves me, he couldn&rsquo;t do that to me. He is just late..yeah, that&rsquo;s the only acceptable option.&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo; Oh for fuck sake. &rdquo; Niall buried his hands into his hands. He was near to cry in front of his friends.</p><p>He missed his boyfriend. He didn&rsquo;t see him for a month, because he had some case in Tokyo for his upcoming album. He was proud of him, but him being not in his arms, safely, hurted Niall. Harry&rsquo;s absence made Niall absolutely crazy.</p><p>&ldquo; Niall, calm down mate, we don&rsquo;t want you to have a panic attack in the middle of your living room. &rdquo; His friends looked at him with worried eyes, because they knew how much the Irish boy loved the younger boy.</p><p>Niall didn&rsquo;t say a word just walked back and forth in the living room. His friends knew that it&rsquo;s better to not say anything to Niall in this condition, because he will snap.</p><p>&ldquo; Connor is right man. Come, sit down on the couch, and take some deep breaths. &rdquo; Shawn said, pointing to the free spot next to him.</p><p>&ldquo; Guys, I am fine. I&rsquo;m just.. &rdquo; Niall started to speak, but he couldn&rsquo;t find the right words to continue his talk, so he listened to his friends and sat down on the comfortable couch, and embraced his legs with his arms, and put his head on his knees.</p><p>Niall closed his eyes for a moment, and the bad thoughts filled his mind again. Salty tears started to form in his eyes, and as much as he didn&rsquo;t want to cry, he let them stream down on his face. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know how much time had passed by, but he heard his friends calling his name.</p><p>&ldquo; Niall, man.. &rdquo; they said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo; What is it guys? &rdquo; He wiped off the tears from his face.</p><p>&ldquo; Your boy is.. &rdquo; His friends started to speak, but a heavy bag was heard to put down in the hallway.</p><p>Niall turned his head to the the noise, and when he saw his boyfriend with a bunch of roses in his hand, the Irish boy got up quickly from the couch, and ran to his boyfriend arms immediately, almost slipping on the carpet.</p><p>Niall didn&rsquo;t care about his friends saying <i>slow down mate</i> shouts, Niall just wanted to hold his boyfriend forever in his arms.</p><p>Like a kid, Niall jumped on Harry, which made the roses fall out from his hand. He buried his head into younger boy&rsquo;s chest. His legs were around Harry&rsquo;s waist, and he was holding his boyfriend&rsquo;s t-shirt so tightly didn&rsquo;t care that it will rip apart.</p><p>(But after his friends will be gone, one way or another it will end on the floor like their other clothes, but that&rsquo;s an an another story to tell) </p><p>&ldquo; Please tell me that you are real, and it&rsquo;s not my imagination playing with me. &rdquo; Niall whispered, and he looked up at the curly haired boy with tears forming in his eyes again.</p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m very much real darling. &rdquo; Harry wiped off the tears from Niall&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo; I&rsquo;m here now. &rdquo; He placed a soft kiss on the Irish boy&rsquo;s lips, while he put his hands on his face.</p><p>Minutes passed by, and some throat clearing was heard in the living room. The two boy pulled apart, completely forgetting that there were other people a few meters away from them.</p><p>Niall showed a middle finger into their direction, while Harry placed an another kiss on the older boy&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo; I missed you. &rdquo; Harry whispered to Niall, who just bit his lips and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo; I missed you more. &rdquo; He replied truthfully. </p><p>&ldquo; He was about to go crazy. &rdquo; Connor laughed in the back.</p><p>&ldquo; I did not. &rdquo; Niall muttered, and a blush appeared on his face.</p><p>&ldquo; Whatever you say mate. &rdquo; His friends said, smiling into their direction. &ldquo; At least you are here now Harry. That&rsquo;s all matters. &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; Yeah. &rdquo; Harry said, pressing his lips to Niall&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere from now. &rdquo;</p></p>",

Bambi, you\u2019re a kid don\u2019t say things like that. I\u2019m 13 already, basically a teenager.\u201d His answer made the girl pout. She hated how he always had to bring up the fact that she was four years younger than him just to call her a kid.

From Harry.</i>\u201d Then she flipped the card over, expecting more but those were the only few lines she could find. Laughing, she looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple and meaningful,\u201d he said, laughing along and pulling out from his pocket something else.

Bambi, you\u2019re a kid don\u2019t say things like that. I\u2019m 13 already, basically a teenager.\u201d His answer made the girl pout. She hated how he always had to bring up the fact that she was four years younger than him just to call her a kid. But Harry didn\u2019t seem to care if he got her  upset, he handed her back the card and said, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be having a boyfriend either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not my boyfriend.\u201d The girl huffed, shooting her older friend a glare. \u201cAre you gonna eat this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Harry crossed his arms and turned away, sticking his nose up.</p><p>\u201cFine.

From Harry.</i>\u201d Then she flipped the card over, expecting more but those were the only few lines she could find. Laughing, she looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple and meaningful,\u201d he said, laughing along and pulling out from his pocket something else. Without waiting for her to ask, he took her wrist and put the seashell bracelet on for her.</p><p>\u201cOh my god! Cool!\u201d Y/N bounced up and down as her eyes sparked with joy. \u201cDid you buy this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma did, b-but it\u2019s my money\u2026\u201d He said, scratching the back of his head, making her smile.</p><p>Without a warning, Y/N wrapped her arms around his waist, pulling her older friend into a hug and repeatedly thanking him for the gift as well as the card. Harry held the girl\u2019s shoulders to push her away before she suffocated him, telling her goodbye since he must now get home to do his chores.</p><p>\u201cWait, I also have something for you!\u201d She said, biting her lip in excitement. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Harry immediately took a step back, eyes squinted in doubt. \u201cWhat are you gonna do? Are you gonna give me those bugs again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m saving them for Halloween.\u201d She giggled when a look of horror flashed on his face.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Harry finally closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d He said. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s green eyes shot open and the corners of his mouth curved into a smile when he saw her holding up a pack of Hershey Kisses.</p><p>\u201cAccept my sweet <i>kisses</i>,\u201d she said as both of them broke into a fit of laughter. </p><p>The boy thanked his little friend for the chocolate and hurriedly ran back home before his mother found out he hadn\u2019t cleaned his room yet. Watching him go, Y/N kept smiling from ear to ear. Now the girl couldn\u2019t wait until they were older so she could finally give him real kisses on Valentine\u2019s Day.</p>",
