        "answer": "<p>Warnings: drugs and alcohol abuse, self harm, mentions of molesting, statutory rape. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Peter <i>Parker</i> has never fit into his family. </p><p>He was adopted after his parents got in a car accident with his aunt and uncle, all of them dying. His grandma was just too grief stricken after losing both her children to take any kind of proper care of him. </p><p>So Peter <i>Parker</i> got adopted by Tony Stark and Pepper Stark. </p><p>He never saw his grandma again. She\u2019s still alive, still working even. She\u2019s only seventy-something. She just wants nothing to do with him. Never reached out, never sent letters. Never sent pictures of him or his parents.</p><p>He grew up feeling unwanted by his grandma. By his parents, even though that isn\u2019t fair. And his adoptive parents&hellip; they kept his last name. They didn\u2019t change it. They always made it clear he was adopted, and that he wasn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>It\u2019s hard not to feel like they don\u2019t actually want him, when they make it clear so often that he isn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>So when they announce to him that they\u2019re pregnant\u2014it\u2019s a miracle!! A miracle, Peter, they said I would never get pregnant!!\u2014he falls deeper into a depression he\u2019s turned out to be very good at hiding. </p><p>This baby will be named Morgan <i>Stark</i>. Stark. Because they actually want this baby. They\u2019ll love this baby, be proud of this baby. </p><p>Peter started cutting the day they announced. </p><p>It\u2019s been three months since then, the baby being due in six. He cuts often. In the shower, before school. After he sees Tony kissing Pepper\u2019s stomach. After he sees them move all the baby things in. After he sees them go to doctors appointments. </p><p>He drinks every night, not that the Stark\u2019s notice. He goes to Skip\u2019s house, gets drunk off his ass, hopes Skip didn\u2019t touch him. Acknowledges that he probably does. Goes home still drunk, not that they notice. </p><p>At six months in, Skip gave him some pill. He didn\u2019t know what it was, and he didn\u2019t ask. He swallowed it, using whiskey to smooth the way. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what it is, but it makes him not care anymore. He stops cutting, because why would he? He\u2019s so happy now. He fucks Skip, because the fact that Skip is 22 and he\u2019s 14 doesn\u2019t send off any alarm bells. Or the fact that he hates Skip. He loves the man now! He keeps giving Peter the pills. He loves those pills! And sex is amazing, it feels so good. He loves sex. Skip is really good at it, he makes Peter cum like five times. It\u2019s so amazing, Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever lived without it. </p><p>How sad is it, that they don\u2019t notice anything is wrong until he starts acting happier? </p><p>He walks around humming, dancing to no music. He gets better grades, because he studies when he isn\u2019t fucking or getting drunk and high. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t sleep anymore. Maybe an hour a night. He\u2019s never tired, he even stopped drinking coffee. </p><p>\u201cPeter? Can I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up from his homework, smiling. \u201cHey, dad. What\u2019s up?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMe and your mom are worried about you&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Peter says happily. He looks back to his homework. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re&hellip; you\u2019re acting so differently. We\u2019re glad to see you so happy, but we\u2014we\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>Peter hums and looks up again. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Promise.\u201d He says. \u201cI even stopped cutting, I\u2019m more than fine! I\u2019ve never been-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou were cutting yourself?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice breaks. </p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cOh, oops. I wansnt supposed to tell you that. I forgot. It\u2019s okay! I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony gets closer. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>Peter stands. \u201cI promise! I\u2019m okay. Skip takes really good-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSkip? I thought you hated Skip?\u201d</p><p>Peter giggles. \u201cWell yeah, but that was when he was touching me and I didn\u2019t like it. I like it now though, so it\u2019s okay!\u201d He beams. \u201cHe takes really good care of me-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s 22.\u201d Tony whispers in horror. </p><p>Peter hums. \u201cYeah, so he can get me all my drinks and stuff.\u201d Peter giggles. \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Pepper, she\u2019ll be soooo mad.\u201d</p><p>Tony leans back, rubbing his face. \u201cAre you drunk right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cNope! I\u2019m still high though, although I\u2019m gonna crash soon. I need to get to Skip before 9:00 or he\u2019ll lock me out and won\u2019t give me any until tomorrow.\u201d He looks down, frowning at his hands. \u201cThat sucked that one time, don\u2019t wanna do that again.\u201d He mumbles. </p><p>Tony shakes in horror. \u201cWhy did you- why did you do all this?\u201d He asks, voice broken. \u201cWhy did you cut, why did you go to someone who hurt you, why did you do drugs-\u201c</p><p>Peter tears up now. He needs his new pill, it\u2019s getting harder to stay happy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me anymore. You have a new baby. A new baby with your last name, who\u2019s your baby and not an adopted one. A miracle baby.\u201d He looks at his hands again. \u201cI- I\u2019m just waiting for you to get rid of me like grandma did. Why would you want stupid old me when you have a brand new baby?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Tony feels his heart break. He did this to Peter. He kept Peter\u2019s last name, in hopes that Peter <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> feel unwanted in the future, after finding out he\u2019s adopted after years and years of thinking he wasn\u2019t. He wanted to tell Peter right off, so he would know he was adopted, and that he was loved and wanted and god, it backfired spectacularly. He did all this. He made Peter-\u201c he shakes his head, standing. \u201cI\u2019m- stay here. Im going to get Pepper.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>When they come back, Peter is gone. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter stumbles in at 1:00 AM, giggling happily. He smiles when he sees his parents. \u201cHey!\u201d He says. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t usually awake-\u201c </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on a trip.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeals and claps his hands together. \u201cYay!\u201d He says. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes up, he\u2019s in a hospital. His mom is next to his bed, running her hands over his scars. His dad is in the hallway, on the phone. \u201cwhat-\u201c</p><p>Pepper looks up and Peter winces, seeing her red-rimmed eyes. \u201cOh, Peter!\u201d She hugs him. </p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cMom?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Pepper pulls back and sobs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry we did this to you. You have- don\u2019t worry. You have so many therapy sessions, and you\u2019re going to be in the hospital until all the drugs are out of your system.\u201d</p><p>Peter pales and sits up. \u201cOh my god-\u201c</p><p>Pepper shakes her head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in trouble.\u201d She says, New Years forming in her eyes. \u201cMe and your dad were talking and\u2014we missed all the signs. All the calls for help, all the signals, all the times you explicitly asked for help and we didn\u2019t even see&hellip;\u201d She sobs, kissing his hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Peter. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>Pepper kisses his hand again. \u201cWhat are you confused about, baby?\u201d</p><p>Peter winces at the terms. \u201cYou know? And I\u2019m not in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s our fault. We should have seen. We should have seen you needed us.\u201d She wipes away her own tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry we didn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks and leans back. He falls asleep, letting the medicine work it\u2019s way through him. </p><p>~</p><p>A month later shows Skip Prescott in jail for a life sentence. They did a rape kit on Peter, and being 14, charged him with that. They also charged him with forcing Peter to drink alcohol and forcing him to use drugs. </p><p>Because whatever it is he gave Peter mixed with alcohol can kill a person, they also charged him with attempted murder. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how Tony got this trial started and done with in under a month, but he did. </p><p>Morgan will be here in 2 months now, and Peter is in therapy two days a week after school. </p><p>They work on Peter feeling loved, being wanted. Pepper and Tony put in so much effort, that Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever bought they didn\u2019t want him. </p><p>Well, he does know. But he feels guilty about it. </p><p>When Morgan is born, Peter holds her in his arms. He smiles, and feels such love for his <i>baby sister</i>. \u201cMorgan Parker.\u201d He whispers, kissing her cheek. </p><p>He thinks it\u2019s dumb they\u2019re giving her his own last name; but they said \u201cwe want both our kids to have the same name. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>So Peter is sober. He has a baby sister. His parents love him. Skip is in jail. </p><p>Peter feels like maybe it isn\u2019t hopeless after all. </p>",

His grandma was just too grief stricken after losing both her children to take any kind of proper care of him. </p><p>So Peter <i>Parker</i> got adopted by Tony Stark and Pepper Stark. </p><p>He never saw his grandma again. She\u2019s still alive, still working even. She\u2019s only seventy-something. She just wants nothing to do with him. Never reached out, never sent letters. Never sent pictures of him or his parents.</p><p>He grew up feeling unwanted by his grandma. By his parents, even though that isn\u2019t fair. And his adoptive parents\u2026 they kept his last name. They didn\u2019t change it. They always made it clear he was adopted, and that he wasn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>It\u2019s hard not to feel like they don\u2019t actually want him, when they make it clear so often that he isn\u2019t their kid. </p><p>So when they announce to him that they\u2019re pregnant\u2014it\u2019s a miracle!! A miracle, Peter, they said I would never get pregnant!!\u2014he falls deeper into a depression he\u2019s turned out to be very good at hiding. </p><p>This baby will be named Morgan <i>Stark</i>. Stark. Because they actually want this baby. They\u2019ll love this baby, be proud of this baby. </p><p>Peter started cutting the day they announced. </p><p>It\u2019s been three months since then, the baby being due in six. He cuts often. In the shower, before school. After he sees Tony kissing Pepper\u2019s stomach. After he sees them move all the baby things in. After he sees them go to doctors appointments. </p><p>He drinks every night, not that the Stark\u2019s notice. He goes to Skip\u2019s house, gets drunk off his ass, hopes Skip didn\u2019t touch him. Acknowledges that he probably does. Goes home still drunk, not that they notice. </p><p>At six months in, Skip gave him some pill. He didn\u2019t know what it was, and he didn\u2019t ask. He swallowed it, using whiskey to smooth the way. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what it is, but it makes him not care anymore. He stops cutting, because why would he? He\u2019s so happy now. He fucks Skip, because the fact that Skip is 22 and he\u2019s 14 doesn\u2019t send off any alarm bells. Or the fact that he hates Skip. He loves the man now! He keeps giving Peter the pills. He loves those pills! And sex is amazing, it feels so good. He loves sex. Skip is really good at it, he makes Peter cum like five times. It\u2019s so amazing, Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever lived without it. </p><p>How sad is it, that they don\u2019t notice anything is wrong until he starts acting happier? </p><p>He walks around humming, dancing to no music. He gets better grades, because he studies when he isn\u2019t fucking or getting drunk and high. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t sleep anymore. Maybe an hour a night. He\u2019s never tired, he even stopped drinking coffee. </p><p>\u201cPeter? Can I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up from his homework, smiling. \u201cHey, dad. What\u2019s up?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMe and your mom are worried about you\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Peter says happily. He looks back to his homework. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re acting so differently.

I\u2019ve never been-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou were cutting yourself?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice breaks. </p><p>Peter frowns. \u201cOh, oops. I wansnt supposed to tell you that. I forgot. It\u2019s okay! I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Tony gets closer. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>Peter stands. \u201cI promise! I\u2019m okay. Skip takes really good-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSkip? I thought you hated Skip?\u201d</p><p>Peter giggles. \u201cWell yeah, but that was when he was touching me and I didn\u2019t like it. I like it now though, so it\u2019s okay!\u201d He beams. \u201cHe takes really good care of me-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s 22.\u201d Tony whispers in horror. </p><p>Peter hums. \u201cYeah, so he can get me all my drinks and stuff.\u201d Peter giggles. \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Pepper, she\u2019ll be soooo mad.\u201d</p><p>Tony leans back, rubbing his face. \u201cAre you drunk right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cNope! I\u2019m still high though, although I\u2019m gonna crash soon. I need to get to Skip before 9:00 or he\u2019ll lock me out and won\u2019t give me any until tomorrow.\u201d He looks down, frowning at his hands. \u201cThat sucked that one time, don\u2019t wanna do that again.\u201d He mumbles. </p><p>Tony shakes in horror. \u201cWhy did you- why did you do all this?\u201d He asks, voice broken. \u201cWhy did you cut, why did you go to someone who hurt you, why did you do drugs-\u201c</p><p>Peter tears up now. He needs his new pill, it\u2019s getting harder to stay happy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me anymore. You have a new baby. A new baby with your last name, who\u2019s your baby and not an adopted one. A miracle baby.\u201d He looks at his hands again. \u201cI- I\u2019m just waiting for you to get rid of me like grandma did. Why would you want stupid old me when you have a brand new baby?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Tony feels his heart break. He did this to Peter. He kept Peter\u2019s last name, in hopes that Peter <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> feel unwanted in the future, after finding out he\u2019s adopted after years and years of thinking he wasn\u2019t. He wanted to tell Peter right off, so he would know he was adopted, and that he was loved and wanted and god, it backfired spectacularly. He did all this. He made Peter-\u201c he shakes his head, standing. \u201cI\u2019m- stay here. Im going to get Pepper.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>When they come back, Peter is gone. </p><p>~</p><p>Peter stumbles in at 1:00 AM, giggling happily. He smiles when he sees his parents. \u201cHey!\u201d He says. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t usually awake-\u201c </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going on a trip.\u201d</p><p>Peter squeals and claps his hands together. \u201cYay!\u201d He says. </p><p>~</p><p>When he wakes up, he\u2019s in a hospital. His mom is next to his bed, running her hands over his scars. His dad is in the hallway, on the phone. \u201cwhat-\u201c</p><p>Pepper looks up and Peter winces, seeing her red-rimmed eyes. \u201cOh, Peter!\u201d She hugs him. </p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cMom?\u201d He asks. </p><p>Pepper pulls back and sobs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry we did this to you. You have- don\u2019t worry. You have so many therapy sessions, and you\u2019re going to be in the hospital until all the drugs are out of your system.\u201d</p><p>Peter pales and sits up. \u201cOh my god-\u201c</p><p>Pepper shakes her head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t in trouble.\u201d She says, New Years forming in her eyes. \u201cMe and your dad were talking and\u2014we missed all the signs. All the calls for help, all the signals, all the times you explicitly asked for help and we didn\u2019t even see\u2026\u201d She sobs, kissing his hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Peter. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks. \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d He whispers. </p><p>Pepper kisses his hand again. \u201cWhat are you confused about, baby?\u201d</p><p>Peter winces at the terms. \u201cYou know? And I\u2019m not in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s our fault. We should have seen. We should have seen you needed us.\u201d She wipes away her own tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry we didn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Peter blinks and leans back. He falls asleep, letting the medicine work it\u2019s way through him. </p><p>~</p><p>A month later shows Skip Prescott in jail for a life sentence. They did a rape kit on Peter, and being 14, charged him with that. They also charged him with forcing Peter to drink alcohol and forcing him to use drugs. </p><p>Because whatever it is he gave Peter mixed with alcohol can kill a person, they also charged him with attempted murder. </p><p>Peter doesn\u2019t know how Tony got this trial started and done with in under a month, but he did. </p><p>Morgan will be here in 2 months now, and Peter is in therapy two days a week after school. </p><p>They work on Peter feeling loved, being wanted. Pepper and Tony put in so much effort, that Peter doesn\u2019t know how he ever bought they didn\u2019t want him. </p><p>Well, he does know. But he feels guilty about it. </p><p>When Morgan is born, Peter holds her in his arms. He smiles, and feels such love for his <i>baby sister</i>. \u201cMorgan Parker.\u201d He whispers, kissing her cheek. </p><p>He thinks it\u2019s dumb they\u2019re giving her his own last name; but they said \u201cwe want both our kids to have the same name. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p><p>So Peter is sober. He has a baby sister. His parents love him. Skip is in jail. </p><p>Peter feels like maybe it isn\u2019t hopeless after all. </p>",
                "content": "<p>Warnings: drugs and alcohol abuse, self harm, mentions of molesting, statutory rape. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Peter <i>Parker</i> has never fit into his family. </p><p>He was adopted after his parents got in a car accident with his aunt and uncle, all of them dying. His grandma was just too grief stricken after losing both her children to take any kind of proper care of him. </p><p>So Peter <i>Parker</i> got adopted by Tony Stark and Pepper Stark. </p><p>He never saw his grandma again. She&rsquo;s still alive, still working even. She&rsquo;s only seventy-something. She just wants nothing to do with him. Never reached out, never sent letters. Never sent pictures of him or his parents.</p><p>He grew up feeling unwanted by his grandma. By his parents, even though that isn&rsquo;t fair. And his adoptive parents&hellip; they kept his last name. They didn&rsquo;t change it. They always made it clear he was adopted, and that he wasn&rsquo;t their kid. </p><p>It&rsquo;s hard not to feel like they don&rsquo;t actually want him, when they make it clear so often that he isn&rsquo;t their kid. </p><p>So when they announce to him that they&rsquo;re pregnant&mdash;it&rsquo;s a miracle!! A miracle, Peter, they said I would never get pregnant!!&mdash;he falls deeper into a depression he&rsquo;s turned out to be very good at hiding. </p><p>This baby will be named Morgan <i>Stark</i>. Stark. Because they actually want this baby. They&rsquo;ll love this baby, be proud of this baby. </p><p>Peter started cutting the day they announced. </p><p>It&rsquo;s been three months since then, the baby being due in six. He cuts often. In the shower, before school. After he sees Tony kissing Pepper&rsquo;s stomach. After he sees them move all the baby things in. After he sees them go to doctors appointments. </p><p>He drinks every night, not that the Stark&rsquo;s notice. He goes to Skip&rsquo;s house, gets drunk off his ass, hopes Skip didn&rsquo;t touch him. Acknowledges that he probably does. Goes home still drunk, not that they notice. </p><p>At six months in, Skip gave him some pill. He didn&rsquo;t know what it was, and he didn&rsquo;t ask. He swallowed it, using whiskey to smooth the way. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what it is, but it makes him not care anymore. He stops cutting, because why would he? He&rsquo;s so happy now. He fucks Skip, because the fact that Skip is 22 and he&rsquo;s 14 doesn&rsquo;t send off any alarm bells. Or the fact that he hates Skip. He loves the man now! He keeps giving Peter the pills. He loves those pills! And sex is amazing, it feels so good. He loves sex. Skip is really good at it, he makes Peter cum like five times. It&rsquo;s so amazing, Peter doesn&rsquo;t know how he ever lived without it. </p><p>How sad is it, that they don&rsquo;t notice anything is wrong until he starts acting happier? </p><p>He walks around humming, dancing to no music. He gets better grades, because he studies when he isn&rsquo;t fucking or getting drunk and high. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t sleep anymore. Maybe an hour a night. He&rsquo;s never tired, he even stopped drinking coffee. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter? Can I talk to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks up from his homework, smiling. &ldquo;Hey, dad. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Me and your mom are worried about you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo; Peter says happily. He looks back to his homework. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you&rsquo;re&hellip; you&rsquo;re acting so differently. We&rsquo;re glad to see you so happy, but we&mdash;we&rsquo;re worried.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hums and looks up again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine! Promise.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;I even stopped cutting, I&rsquo;m more than fine! I&rsquo;ve never been-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were cutting yourself?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice breaks. </p><p>Peter frowns. &ldquo;Oh, oops. I wansnt supposed to tell you that. I forgot. It&rsquo;s okay! I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gets closer. &ldquo;Peter-&ldquo;</p><p>Peter stands. &ldquo;I promise! I&rsquo;m okay. Skip takes really good-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Skip? I thought you hated Skip?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter giggles. &ldquo;Well yeah, but that was when he was touching me and I didn&rsquo;t like it. I like it now though, so it&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo; He beams. &ldquo;He takes really good care of me-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s 22.&rdquo; Tony whispers in horror. </p><p>Peter hums. &ldquo;Yeah, so he can get me all my drinks and stuff.&rdquo; Peter giggles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Tell Pepper, she&rsquo;ll be soooo mad.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony leans back, rubbing his face. &ldquo;Are you drunk right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shakes his head. &ldquo;Nope!

She is most commonly called Kate so that is what she is referred to as in the smol one shot :)</p><p>Warnings: Fluff, mentions of death and some swearing.</p><p>Summary: Peter has a nightmare and Kate comforts him in a way that he has never seen her before. It all ends in some cuddles :)</p><p>Story </p><p>Kate looked at the clock on her nightstand, 1:24 am. Someone was knocking on her door but who the hell would be knocking on her door at this time? Tony&rsquo;s actually asleep at this time and that&rsquo;s saying something because he&rsquo;s usually working on something in his lab. </p><p>Kate got up and opened the door to see her best friend, Peter Parker standing there, tears running down his cheeks and his eyes red and puffy from crying. Kate&rsquo;s expression softened as she pulled him into a hug while saying &ldquo;Oh Peter&hellip; Come on..&rdquo; She led him inside, closing the door behind her as he sat on her bed. She lied down and Peter followed her actions as she pulled the duvet up to their waists. She hugged Peter who cried into her shoulder with his arms around her waist. Kate made small circles on his back with her thumb and petted his hair. She wasn&rsquo;t used to doing this but she remembered doing it for some soldiers back in the 1940s when one had severe PTSD or had a nightmare before she got frozen at 15. </p><p>They stayed like this for 10 minutes before Kate leaned back to look at Peter and asked &ldquo;Do you want to get some tea and then you can talk to me if you want to?&rdquo; Peter nodded and got out of the bed. Kate followed but also grabbed a light blanket and put it on Peter&rsquo;s shoulders who wrapped it around himself and murmered a quiet &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;. </p><p>The two friends walked to the kitchen in silence, periodically broken by Peter sniffing and Kate coughing. She filled the kettle up with water and put it on while Peter sat on a stool by the island. Kate got two cups out, put a tea bag in each and put one spoon of honey into each of them before leaning against the island as they waited for the kettle to boil and she began to hum &ldquo;Girls / Girls / Boys&rdquo; and he listened to her. </p><p>Peter had never seen Katelyn act this way before. When he knocked on her door, he regretted it but when he heard her call him by his first name and when she hugged him, he realised it was genuine. Kate always called him by his last name 'Parker&rsquo; and while yes, he had gone to her with problems before, she had never acted like this but instead like her usual sarcastic self yet still giving good advice. It was nice seeing her act this kind and comforting.</p><p>When the kettle finshed boiling the water, Kate poured it into the two cups, took the tea bags out, put some milk into them and passed Peter his while she took her own and they walked into the sitting room to sit down, talk and drink their tea. They chose to sit on the couch in front of the television, a glass table with a couple of coasters on it between the couch and the TV. </p><p>After drinking some of their tea, the pair put their cups on the table and turned to each other. Peter took a deep breath and said &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m ready t-to talk i-if you w-want t-to listen.&rdquo; Kate looked at him and said &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll listen. Take your time.&rdquo; He took another deep breath and began, &ldquo;I had a nightmare where everyone I loved and cared about was lying on the floor, dead. May was there so was Ned, MJ, Mr. Stark, y-you,&rdquo; he choked up when he said 'you&rsquo; but continued. &ldquo;You were in your Lunar Eclipse suit but it was torn, your mask was torn too. The voice changer was in pieces and so was your shield. When I knelt over you, you held my hand as you cried and bled out and I-I c-couldn&rsquo;t do a-anything a-about it.&rdquo; Peter was crying again and Kate saw this and immediately hugged him, balancing on her knees and said &ldquo;Hey, hey, hey. Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;re not going to die. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere alright. Shhhhhh. It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter cried into her shoulder and she tried her best to comfort him. She thought she was doing a shit job at this whole comforting thing but she was doing a damn good job at comforting Peter because he calmed down within minutes. When he stopped crying, Kate got the message and let go of him, only for him and pull her into his chest again and ask &ldquo;I-Is it okay if we stay like this?&rdquo; Kate smiled and answered &ldquo;Perfectly fine.&rdquo; </p><p>Kate wasn&rsquo;t exactly the kind of person you would find jumping at every opportunity to cuddle and often actively avoided doing so but she cuddles with Peter quite a bit. </p><p>Peter moved the blanket from under him to over Kate and their legs so that way, they were both somewhat warm. </p><p>They ended falling asleep in each other&rsquo;s embrace and Peter didn&rsquo;t have another nightmare. </p><p>Tony walked into the sitting room the next morning and almost spat out his coffee when he saw two abandoned cups of tea and the two teenagers asleep on the couch cuddling. He then smiled to himself and took a few pictures. He said to himself as he walked away, &ldquo;Wait until I show the others&hellip;.&rdquo; </p><p>*End*</p>",
