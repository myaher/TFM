No one can say that Peter doesn&rsquo;t love y/n.</p><p>Once again she was waiting for him. On the 5th floor balcony of her building. On a cold night. With worry running through her veins. And with the regret that was to come. </p><p>Since they started dating the two teenagers have been inseparable. The couple showed affection in their own way. Peter would normally have his arm around her shoulder, not to show possessiveness over her, like the way he had seen boys do to their girlfriends, but to show her that he was right beside her.\u00a0</p><p>Her arm would be in his waist, her fingertips holding tightly his shirt. Sometimes he could feel her skin touching his and that was the moment his heart would melt for her. With just a simple and unintentional touch. </p><p>Everyday, Peter would be waiting for her right in front of school. Opening a big and real smile just for her. She would hug him and be able to properly give him a 'good morning&rsquo; kiss. </p><p>But things change.</p><p>When y/n saw the Blue and Red figure she knew what was about to come. Taking a deep breath, her fingers went right to her neck where the necklace Peter had gave her 4 months ago stood. </p><p><i>Peter was nervous and she could feel it.

Just passing the time while they waited for May to tell them that the dinner was served. This was something they always did.

You&rsquo;re weird today, Parker. You&rsquo;ve been quiet the whole day and I can feel something is up</i>.&rdquo; </p><p><i>The boy did the same as she and sat up.

He positioned it right in front of her and held it while she was opening.</i></p><p>A little shiny stone from a necklace rested on her chest after that. She never took it off. When she did, it feels like something was missing. That thing became like an armor to her. Because that night was when she realized how in love she was with Peter Parker. </p><p>But things change.</p><p>The superhero landed close to her, but not yet close enough to touch. </p><p>Y/N let out a deep breath when he took the Spider-man mask off. His face was clear, without any black eye or scratch. She was relieved when she saw he was fine. Another night patrol that went well. </p><p>Peter smiled at her but when he took another glace he noticed she was sad. &ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; he started getting closer but she pulled herself away from him. His face turned into a confused expression. She never had ran from him. </p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk.&rdquo; Was the only thing she said to him. While her fingers were still playing with the necklace. The boy saw that, she only did it when she was nervous. </p><p>Seeing her body shiver when a gust of wind passed by them. &ldquo;We should go inside, it&rsquo;s cold out here.&rdquo; Peter tried to hold her hand to pull her inside her room but again she didn&rsquo;t let him hold it. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p><p>She embraced herself, ready to break the boys heart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, Peter. I don&rsquo;t think we should keep doing this.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by 'doing this&rsquo;?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Us, Peter. I&rsquo;m tired of this thing we are doing. The dating thing. I don&rsquo;t know where my mind was when I accepted it. This isn&rsquo;t working anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>His heart was beating harder than he thought was possible. His eyes were glued on her.</p><p>But her eyes were everywhere but him. She wouldn&rsquo;t dare to look in his eyes while he was breaking right in front of her. </p><p>Peter took everything inside of him to keep up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand y/n, we were just fine this morning.&rdquo; He said remembering the moment he first saw her that day.\u00a0 &ldquo;What happened? <i>What changed</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>She turned around and Peter was facing her back. Her head was low, tense shoulders. Her body looked even smaller for him in this situation. When her body started to shake, he couldn&rsquo;t take anymore.</p><p>His chest hit her back while his arms wrapped around her waist. That&rsquo;s when she broke down. She knew how much it would hurt. But she had to do it.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Peter.&rdquo; Her fingers opened his hands and placed the necklace there. He felt the small and fragile gift and embraced her even tighter. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; He begged in her ear.\u00a0 </p><p>She made herself free of his arms and turned around and faced his chest. &ldquo;I want you to go, Peter.&rdquo; The tears streaming down her face. He shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on in your head right now, y/n. But I know you don&rsquo;t want this. You don&rsquo;t want me to go. I know you. This is not you.&rdquo; He touched her face. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop. I want you to go.&rdquo; She said shaking her head making his hands off of her. &ldquo;So I want you to look at me in the eyes. I want to hear that you truly want me out of here. I want to see it in your eyes.&rdquo; He said. </p><p>Y/N took everything inside of her to pull her head up and look at those sweet eyes she grew to love. Peter knew what was to come. He knew that girl. She was strong. And even if she didn&rsquo;t want something she would broke boundaries to do it. </p><p>Without any hesitation she told him &ldquo;I want you to go, Peter.&rdquo; </p><p>With that, Peter took a few steps away from her. His hands holding strong the necklace, not minding if it broke. His heart was in a worst state than a broken necklace would ever be.</p><p>Peter nodded and took a last look at her full of tears face. His own eyes failing in kepping the water inside of them. In a second he put the mask back on his face and left her building. She sobbed when the reality washed over her.</p><p>He was gone. Her armor was gone. And they would never be the same again. </p><p>&hellip;</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcL77X72gBqjgfRid57NyjQ\">@upsidedownparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCsTu6FsfTG4Aoim29jxhzQ\">@starksparker</a> </p>",

I don\u2019t know what to say about this piece \u2018cause I like it but it\u2019s up to you. I had more of the story but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be good to post but\u2026 we\u2019ll see.That being said.

No one can say that Peter doesn\u2019t love y/n.</p><p>Once again she was waiting for him. On the 5th floor balcony of her building. On a cold night. With worry running through her veins. And with the regret that was to come. </p><p>Since they started dating the two teenagers have been inseparable. The couple showed affection in their own way. Peter would normally have his arm around her shoulder, not to show possessiveness over her, like the way he had seen boys do to their girlfriends, but to show her that he was right beside her.\u00a0</p><p>Her arm would be in his waist, her fingertips holding tightly his shirt. Sometimes he could feel her skin touching his and that was the moment his heart would melt for her. With just a simple and unintentional touch. </p><p>Everyday, Peter would be waiting for her right in front of school. Opening a big and real smile just for her. She would hug him and be able to properly give him a 'good morning\u2019 kiss. </p><p>But things change.</p><p>When y/n saw the Blue and Red figure she knew what was about to come. Taking a deep breath, her fingers went right to her neck where the necklace Peter had gave her 4 months ago stood. </p><p><i>Peter was nervous and she could feel it.

Peter stretched to his desk beside the bed. When he opened the drawer, y/n could see a a small cloth bag. He positioned it right in front of her and held it while she was opening.</i></p><p>A little shiny stone from a necklace rested on her chest after that. She never took it off. When she did, it feels like something was missing. That thing became like an armor to her. Because that night was when she realized how in love she was with Peter Parker. </p><p>But things change.</p><p>The superhero landed close to her, but not yet close enough to touch. </p><p>Y/N let out a deep breath when he took the Spider-man mask off. His face was clear, without any black eye or scratch. She was relieved when she saw he was fine. Another night patrol that went well. </p><p>Peter smiled at her but when he took another glace he noticed she was sad. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d he started getting closer but she pulled herself away from him. His face turned into a confused expression. She never had ran from him. </p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d Was the only thing she said to him. While her fingers were still playing with the necklace. The boy saw that, she only did it when she was nervous. </p><p>Seeing her body shiver when a gust of wind passed by them. \u201cWe should go inside, it\u2019s cold out here.\u201d Peter tried to hold her hand to pull her inside her room but again she didn\u2019t let him hold it. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She embraced herself, ready to break the boys heart. \u201cI\u2019m tired, Peter. I don\u2019t think we should keep doing this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by 'doing this\u2019?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cUs, Peter. I\u2019m tired of this thing we are doing. The dating thing. I don\u2019t know where my mind was when I accepted it. This isn\u2019t working anymore.\u201d </p><p>His heart was beating harder than he thought was possible. His eyes were glued on her.</p><p>But her eyes were everywhere but him. She wouldn\u2019t dare to look in his eyes while he was breaking right in front of her. </p><p>Peter took everything inside of him to keep up. \u201cI don\u2019t understand y/n, we were just fine this morning.\u201d He said remembering the moment he first saw her that day.\u00a0 \u201cWhat happened? <i>What changed</i>?\u201d </p><p>She turned around and Peter was facing her back. Her head was low, tense shoulders. Her body looked even smaller for him in this situation. When her body started to shake, he couldn\u2019t take anymore.</p><p>His chest hit her back while his arms wrapped around her waist. That\u2019s when she broke down. She knew how much it would hurt. But she had to do it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter.\u201d Her fingers opened his hands and placed the necklace there. He felt the small and fragile gift and embraced her even tighter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this.\u201d He begged in her ear.\u00a0 </p><p>She made herself free of his arms and turned around and faced his chest. \u201cI want you to go, Peter.\u201d The tears streaming down her face. He shook his head. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in your head right now, y/n. But I know you don\u2019t want this. You don\u2019t want me to go. I know you. This is not you.\u201d He touched her face. </p><p>\u201cStop. I want you to go.\u201d She said shaking her head making his hands off of her. \u201cSo I want you to look at me in the eyes. I want to hear that you truly want me out of here. I want to see it in your eyes.\u201d He said. </p><p>Y/N took everything inside of her to pull her head up and look at those sweet eyes she grew to love. Peter knew what was to come. He knew that girl. She was strong. And even if she didn\u2019t want something she would broke boundaries to do it. </p><p>Without any hesitation she told him \u201cI want you to go, Peter.\u201d </p><p>With that, Peter took a few steps away from her. His hands holding strong the necklace, not minding if it broke. His heart was in a worst state than a broken necklace would ever be.</p><p>Peter nodded and took a last look at her full of tears face. His own eyes failing in kepping the water inside of them. In a second he put the mask back on his face and left her building. She sobbed when the reality washed over her.</p><p>He was gone. Her armor was gone. And they would never be the same again. </p><p>\u2026</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcL77X72gBqjgfRid57NyjQ\">@upsidedownparker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCsTu6FsfTG4Aoim29jxhzQ\">@starksparker</a> </p></p>",

School, saving the city, and extracurriculars always tired him out at the end of each day. Every night, his bed would welcome him with open arms and he\u2019d fall face flat into his pillow, waking up energized once again in the morning. </p><p>But when the teacher assigned you to be his chemistry lab partner, his nights started to grow longer. </p><p>Then when you started to hang out with him, Ned, and Michelle outside of class, the nights became endless. </p><p>After his nightly escapades, he\u2019d stare at his bedroom ceiling, ruffling his dark chestnut hair and wonder why it was so hard to sleep nowadays. He\u2019d recount the occurrences throughout his day, but his thoughts always circled back to you, thinking what it\u2019d be like to lace his fingers with yours. Walk arm-in-arm with you down Midtown High\u2019s halls. Nudge his nose into your shoulder. Kiss your soft cheeks. </p><p>And, as always, he\u2019d smack himself with his pillow. </p><p>Peter still couldn\u2019t figure out why he couldn\u2019t sleep at night like he used to. </p><!-- more --><hr><p>\u201cHey, Peter?\u201d </p><p>In the iconic red and blue get-up, swinging from building to building on his way back home, Peter picked up your call via Karen, his trusty AI built within his suit. </p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d he panted. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou sound out of breath. Am I calling at a bad time?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Peter practically screamed into his mask. \u201cNo, I was just running\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. So, my parents are out of town for tonight and with all the recent break-ins in my building, I was wondering if I can stay with you for the night? Since you\u2019re the closest one to me?\u201d You asked Peter while curling your hair around your finger. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d ask Michelle, but she lives across town.\u201d </p><p>Astounded, Peter fell mid-air, forgetting to shoot his webs keep him afloat. A moment later, he realized what was happening. </p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He gasped, followed by a sharp thwip sound echoing through your end. Peter sighed in relief. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?! Did I say something wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The hero squeaked, shaking his head at himself. \u201cNo, I just hit myself on something. I\u2019d love it\u2014I mean, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you came over.\u201d </p><p>After he landed on top of a building, Peter rubbed his hand against the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cMay isn\u2019t home tonight, so I\u2019m not sure if that makes you uncomfortable or not. I mean, not that I want to make you uncomfortable; I want to make sure you\u2019re comfortable! I\u2019m just saying that she isn\u2019t home.\u201d His hand moved from his neck to the front of his forehead, slapping it in the process.</p><p>Your bubbly laughter filled Peter\u2019s ears. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. You know I\u2019m always comfortable with you, Peter.\u201d His cheeks burned against the fabric of his mask. \u201cI\u2019ll be over in 15 minutes. Is that okay?\u201d </p><p>New York\u2019s friendly neighborhood hero noticed the sun setting in front of him, causing him to stop in his tracks. His head whipped around, realizing he had been going the opposite direction from home the entire time since you called.</p><p>\u201cMake it 30? If that\u2019s okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds good! Thanks for letting me stay with you. I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d </p><p>After you hung up, Peter huffed as he headed in the right direction. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so stupid, Peter,\u201d he uttered to himself. </p><p>\u201cI thought that went well,\u201d Karen suddenly chimed in.</p><p>Peter thanked Karen and swung across the city, wasting no time to get back home. </p><hr><p>A knock fell upon Peter\u2019s apartment door and you waited patiently. You glanced down at the time on your phone and came ten minutes later than expected, knowing your friend had a habit of being late. Several loud, rummaging sounds later, a disheveled Peter putting on a loose grey sweater greeted you. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he beamed with a side smile. </p><p>Noting his chest heaving more than usual, you asked, \u201cJust got home from your run?\u201d </p><p>With widened eyes, he replied, \u201cUh\u2026 yeah!\u201d He leaned against the frame of the front door with crossed arms before running a hand through his hair. \u201cYeah, I just got home. You look nice.\u201d </p><p>Glancing down at yourself, you didn\u2019t think you looked any different than your usual self in your jeans, t-shirt, and with your backpack on. Nevertheless, his words made you smile like no tomorrow. \u201cThanks, Peter,\u201d you said while biting your lip. </p><p>Staring into each other\u2019s eyes, it took a moment for Peter to remember why you were there in the first place. He shook his head from his daze and welcomed you to come in. </p><p>You stepped into Peter\u2019s apartment and kicked off your shoes. Looking around, you still mentally photographed images of his place because you\u2019ve only been to Peter\u2019s place a few times before. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks again for letting me stay over.\u201d You adjusted your backpack, releasing one of the straps off your shoulder. \u201cSo, where will I be sleeping?\u201d </p><p>Quickly responding, Peter offered you his bed, while he insisted to stay on the living room couch. Shaking your head fervently, you exclaimed, \u201cNo, I can take the couch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. I can take the couch.\u201d With his thumbs in his front jean pockets, Peter rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet. \u201cMy bed\u2019s way comfier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s more of a reason for me to take the couch than you, Peter,\u201d you commented as you made your way towards the couch, but in a blink of an eye, he stood in between you and the couch.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re my guest\u2014let me take the couch!\u201d</p><p>You pouted and argued, \u201cI\u2019ll take the couch!\u201d </p><p>Peter turned you around by your shoulders, having your back face him, and began to push you towards his room; your socks slid against the floor effortlessly. You tried your best to fight against the force, leaning back to create more difficulty, but your best friend was a lot stronger than he looked. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d You retorted, still trying to stop Peter from pushing you towards his room. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d </p><p>Grunting and not wanting to give up the fight, you crossed your arms and stomped on the floor. Peter stopped pushing you and gave in. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine, we can share the bed!\u201d One second later, Peter registered what he said. He immediately followed-up, \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re comfortable with that. I can also sleep on the floor if anything.\u201d</p><p>Content with the outcome, you willingly made your way to his bedroom with him following behind. \u201cNo one\u2019s sleeping on the floor, tonight, Peter.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Kneeling down beside your backpack, you began to unpack some of your items. \u201cAnd, like I said before, I\u2019m always comfortable with you. As long as you\u2019re okay with sharing the bed, then I\u2019m okay too.\u201d </p><p>When you looked up at Peter behind you, he was like a deer in the headlights. Nodding in agreement, he watched you get up and make your way to the bathroom with your toiletries in hand. Once you were out of sight, he leaned the back of his head against his bedroom wall and exhaled, frustrated that his heart palpitated harder than when he was normally with you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><hr><p>After ordering pizza for dinner and getting ready for bed, the two of you stood in front of Peter\u2019s full-sized bed. He mentally thanked himself that he disposed his twin-sized bed three months ago. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mentioned while watching you get into the bed, positioning yourself on the inside of the bed next to the wall.<b> \u201cThere\u2019s only one blanket.\u201d</b></p><p>You shrugged nonchalantly, sitting up on the bed as you adjusted the blanket and pillow for yourself. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to share,\u201d you faced the boy twiddling his fingers. Half-jokingly, you added, \u201cDon\u2019t hog it, please. I get cold in my sleep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Peter lowly whispered to himself before turning off the light\u2019s wall switch. </p><p>Carefully getting into bed, the boy kept himself near the edge of his bed. Both of you said your good nights to each other. After a few minutes, he glanced over to you huddled, leaning on side, and facing the wall. He turned his focus back to the ceiling like he normally did at night, except this time, he was stiff as a log. He already had a hard time sleeping nowadays; you being in the bed tonight did not help his problem at all. </p><p>Moments later, he figured you were already asleep when he heard your heart slowing down and some faint snoring. For the next few hours, Peter continued to stay wide awake. He kept on glancing at his phone\u2019s clock every now and then, closing his eyes, and tried his best to lull himself to sleep. Despite the fact there weren\u2019t any emergency alerts from his phone, he still considered going out to doing his nightly rounds around the city to tire himself out. But if you were to wake up in the middle of the night, he didn\u2019t want to leave his favorite girl alone. \u00a0</p><p>1:48am glowed against Peter\u2019s face before the hairs on his forearm stood up, feeling something was wrong. Your heart rate was suddenly spiking and he heard you mumbling in your sleep. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you groaned with closed eyes, prior to turning around to face the anxious boy. You began to shiver and frown intensely\u2014something Peter\u2019s never seen from you before. </p><p>\u201cI like you. Why won\u2019t you like me back?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He froze. Peter figured you were dreaming, but did he hear you correctly? On top of that, were you speaking words of truth, or simply saying things from a dream state? </p><p>Unsure of what to do, the concerned boy placed a hand on your shoulder and rubbed it tenderly. All of a sudden, you burst into tears, still not awake, and Peter immediately wrapped his arms around you, pulling your body into his. He began to soothe you and pet your head in the crook of his chest, telling you that it was going to be okay. Eventually, you woke up and realized you were crying in Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he called out your name in a hush tone, looking down at you in his arms. \u201cYou all right?\u201d </p><p>Still shaking, you managed to answer, \u201cI-I just had a bad dream, that\u2019s all.\u201d </p><p>You looked into Peter\u2019s eyes, recalling what occurred in your dream, yet unaware you were talking in your sleep and that Peter had heard your confession. In your dream, you confessed to Peter. Unfortunately, the Peter in your dream ignored you and didn\u2019t reply. You knew it was only a dream, but you believed it was a sign that maybe you should finally confess to Peter what you\u2019ve been feeling all this time. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d You whispered against his face, your minty breath the equivalent of a gust of wind. He was trying his best to focus on you. However, it didn\u2019t help that all he could think about was how your hair smelled fruity and sweet, like strawberries and peaches. God, he could drown in your scent forever. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The tips of your noses touched. You placed a hand on his beating chest, then soon grabbed a handful of his grey sweater. Eagerly, you pulled your crush into you, and gently pressed your lips against his. </p><p>His heart bursted at the seams, the fire in his heart flaring and oozing in each movement of the kiss. All the times he wondered what it\u2019d be like to kiss you were hitting him at 130 miles an hour and he didn\u2019t want to stop this beautiful incident. Peter\u2019s hands were still on your shoulders, holding onto you safely, feeling all the excitement overflowing in your veins too. \u00a0</p><p>The question on your mind had to be asked, so you forced yourself to pull away and blurted: </p><p>\u201cDo you like me?\u201d </p><p>At first, Peter didn\u2019t respond, still in shock over everything that was happening, so you continued, \u201cAs more than a friend?\u201d </p><p>He continued to stare blankly at you, but then gasped when the lightbulb moment happened\u2014you were the reason he couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\u00a0</p><p>Although Peter was aware that he liked you, he never realized it was why he couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he nodded excitedly with a shy laugh. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d </p><p>You nodded in response and had to pinch yourself to make sure that this wasn\u2019t still a dream. Both of you smiled brightly in the darkness of Peter\u2019s bedroom; you pulled him in again for another kiss. This time, the cognizant boy gained the courage to cup your face with his palms; the gentle pressure of the kiss juxtaposed his affectionate grip on you, not wanting to let you go. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Many kisses and little conversations followed and you two eventually passed out right before sunrise. </p><p>Albeit short, Peter hadn\u2019t had such a good, peaceful sleep in a while. </p><p>In retrospect, he never minded staying up all those nights. Nights filled with you made him feel alive, maybe even more than saving the city. </p><p>And he looked forward to more nights with you, even if he lacked all the sleep and energy in the world. \u00a0\u00a0</p>",

So, my parents are out of town for tonight and with all the recent break-ins in my building, I was wondering if I can stay with you for the night?

A moment later, he realized what was happening. </p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He gasped, followed by a sharp thwip sound echoing through your end. Peter sighed in relief. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?! Did I say something wrong?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The hero squeaked, shaking his head at himself. \u201cNo, I just hit myself on something. I\u2019d love it\u2014I mean, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you came over.\u201d </p><p>After he landed on top of a building, Peter rubbed his hand against the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cMay isn\u2019t home tonight, so I\u2019m not sure if that makes you uncomfortable or not. I mean, not that I want to make you uncomfortable; I want to make sure you\u2019re comfortable! I\u2019m just saying that she isn\u2019t home.\u201d His hand moved from his neck to the front of his forehead, slapping it in the process.</p><p>Your bubbly laughter filled Peter\u2019s ears. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. You know I\u2019m always comfortable with you, Peter.\u201d His cheeks burned against the fabric of his mask. \u201cI\u2019ll be over in 15 minutes. Is that okay?\u201d </p><p>New York\u2019s friendly neighborhood hero noticed the sun setting in front of him, causing him to stop in his tracks. His head whipped around, realizing he had been going the opposite direction from home the entire time since you called.</p><p>\u201cMake it 30? If that\u2019s okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSounds good! Thanks for letting me stay with you. I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d </p><p>After you hung up, Peter huffed as he headed in the right direction. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so stupid, Peter,\u201d he uttered to himself. </p><p>\u201cI thought that went well,\u201d Karen suddenly chimed in.</p><p>Peter thanked Karen and swung across the city, wasting no time to get back home. </p><hr><p>A knock fell upon Peter\u2019s apartment door and you waited patiently. You glanced down at the time on your phone and came ten minutes later than expected, knowing your friend had a habit of being late. Several loud, rummaging sounds later, a disheveled Peter putting on a loose grey sweater greeted you. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he beamed with a side smile. </p><p>Noting his chest heaving more than usual, you asked, \u201cJust got home from your run?\u201d </p><p>With widened eyes, he replied, \u201cUh\u2026 yeah!\u201d He leaned against the frame of the front door with crossed arms before running a hand through his hair. \u201cYeah, I just got home. You look nice.\u201d </p><p>Glancing down at yourself, you didn\u2019t think you looked any different than your usual self in your jeans, t-shirt, and with your backpack on. Nevertheless, his words made you smile like no tomorrow. \u201cThanks, Peter,\u201d you said while biting your lip. </p><p>Staring into each other\u2019s eyes, it took a moment for Peter to remember why you were there in the first place. He shook his head from his daze and welcomed you to come in. </p><p>You stepped into Peter\u2019s apartment and kicked off your shoes. Looking around, you still mentally photographed images of his place because you\u2019ve only been to Peter\u2019s place a few times before. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks again for letting me stay over.\u201d You adjusted your backpack, releasing one of the straps off your shoulder. \u201cSo, where will I be sleeping?\u201d </p><p>Quickly responding, Peter offered you his bed, while he insisted to stay on the living room couch. Shaking your head fervently, you exclaimed, \u201cNo, I can take the couch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. I can take the couch.\u201d With his thumbs in his front jean pockets, Peter rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet. \u201cMy bed\u2019s way comfier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s more of a reason for me to take the couch than you, Peter,\u201d you commented as you made your way towards the couch, but in a blink of an eye, he stood in between you and the couch.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re my guest\u2014let me take the couch!\u201d</p><p>You pouted and argued, \u201cI\u2019ll take the couch!\u201d </p><p>Peter turned you around by your shoulders, having your back face him, and began to push you towards his room; your socks slid against the floor effortlessly. You tried your best to fight against the force, leaning back to create more difficulty, but your best friend was a lot stronger than he looked. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d You retorted, still trying to stop Peter from pushing you towards his room. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d </p><p>Grunting and not wanting to give up the fight, you crossed your arms and stomped on the floor. Peter stopped pushing you and gave in. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine, we can share the bed!\u201d One second later, Peter registered what he said. He immediately followed-up, \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re comfortable with that. I can also sleep on the floor if anything.\u201d</p><p>Content with the outcome, you willingly made your way to his bedroom with him following behind. \u201cNo one\u2019s sleeping on the floor, tonight, Peter.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Kneeling down beside your backpack, you began to unpack some of your items. \u201cAnd, like I said before, I\u2019m always comfortable with you. As long as you\u2019re okay with sharing the bed, then I\u2019m okay too.\u201d </p><p>When you looked up at Peter behind you, he was like a deer in the headlights. Nodding in agreement, he watched you get up and make your way to the bathroom with your toiletries in hand. Once you were out of sight, he leaned the back of his head against his bedroom wall and exhaled, frustrated that his heart palpitated harder than when he was normally with you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><hr><p>After ordering pizza for dinner and getting ready for bed, the two of you stood in front of Peter\u2019s full-sized bed. He mentally thanked himself that he disposed his twin-sized bed three months ago. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mentioned while watching you get into the bed, positioning yourself on the inside of the bed next to the wall.<b> \u201cThere\u2019s only one blanket.\u201d</b></p><p>You shrugged nonchalantly, sitting up on the bed as you adjusted the blanket and pillow for yourself. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to share,\u201d you faced the boy twiddling his fingers. Half-jokingly, you added, \u201cDon\u2019t hog it, please. I get cold in my sleep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Peter lowly whispered to himself before turning off the light\u2019s wall switch. </p><p>Carefully getting into bed, the boy kept himself near the edge of his bed. Both of you said your good nights to each other. After a few minutes, he glanced over to you huddled, leaning on side, and facing the wall. He turned his focus back to the ceiling like he normally did at night, except this time, he was stiff as a log. He already had a hard time sleeping nowadays; you being in the bed tonight did not help his problem at all. </p><p>Moments later, he figured you were already asleep when he heard your heart slowing down and some faint snoring. For the next few hours, Peter continued to stay wide awake. He kept on glancing at his phone\u2019s clock every now and then, closing his eyes, and tried his best to lull himself to sleep. Despite the fact there weren\u2019t any emergency alerts from his phone, he still considered going out to doing his nightly rounds around the city to tire himself out. But if you were to wake up in the middle of the night, he didn\u2019t want to leave his favorite girl alone. \u00a0</p><p>1:48am glowed against Peter\u2019s face before the hairs on his forearm stood up, feeling something was wrong. Your heart rate was suddenly spiking and he heard you mumbling in your sleep. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you groaned with closed eyes, prior to turning around to face the anxious boy. You began to shiver and frown intensely\u2014something Peter\u2019s never seen from you before. </p><p>\u201cI like you. Why won\u2019t you like me back?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He froze. Peter figured you were dreaming, but did he hear you correctly? On top of that, were you speaking words of truth, or simply saying things from a dream state? </p><p>Unsure of what to do, the concerned boy placed a hand on your shoulder and rubbed it tenderly. All of a sudden, you burst into tears, still not awake, and Peter immediately wrapped his arms around you, pulling your body into his. He began to soothe you and pet your head in the crook of his chest, telling you that it was going to be okay. Eventually, you woke up and realized you were crying in Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he called out your name in a hush tone, looking down at you in his arms. \u201cYou all right?\u201d </p><p>Still shaking, you managed to answer, \u201cI-I just had a bad dream, that\u2019s all.\u201d </p><p>You looked into Peter\u2019s eyes, recalling what occurred in your dream, yet unaware you were talking in your sleep and that Peter had heard your confession. In your dream, you confessed to Peter. Unfortunately, the Peter in your dream ignored you and didn\u2019t reply. You knew it was only a dream, but you believed it was a sign that maybe you should finally confess to Peter what you\u2019ve been feeling all this time. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d You whispered against his face, your minty breath the equivalent of a gust of wind. He was trying his best to focus on you. However, it didn\u2019t help that all he could think about was how your hair smelled fruity and sweet, like strawberries and peaches. God, he could drown in your scent forever. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The tips of your noses touched. You placed a hand on his beating chest, then soon grabbed a handful of his grey sweater. Eagerly, you pulled your crush into you, and gently pressed your lips against his. </p><p>His heart bursted at the seams, the fire in his heart flaring and oozing in each movement of the kiss. All the times he wondered what it\u2019d be like to kiss you were hitting him at 130 miles an hour and he didn\u2019t want to stop this beautiful incident. Peter\u2019s hands were still on your shoulders, holding onto you safely, feeling all the excitement overflowing in your veins too. \u00a0</p><p>The question on your mind had to be asked, so you forced yourself to pull away and blurted: </p><p>\u201cDo you like me?\u201d </p><p>At first, Peter didn\u2019t respond, still in shock over everything that was happening, so you continued, \u201cAs more than a friend?\u201d </p><p>He continued to stare blankly at you, but then gasped when the lightbulb moment happened\u2014you were the reason he couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\u00a0</p><p>Although Peter was aware that he liked you, he never realized it was why he couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he nodded excitedly with a shy laugh. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d </p><p>You nodded in response and had to pinch yourself to make sure that this wasn\u2019t still a dream. Both of you smiled brightly in the darkness of Peter\u2019s bedroom; you pulled him in again for another kiss. This time, the cognizant boy gained the courage to cup your face with his palms; the gentle pressure of the kiss juxtaposed his affectionate grip on you, not wanting to let you go. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Many kisses and little conversations followed and you two eventually passed out right before sunrise. </p><p>Albeit short, Peter hadn\u2019t had such a good, peaceful sleep in a while. </p><p>In retrospect, he never minded staying up all those nights. Nights filled with you made him feel alive, maybe even more than saving the city. </p><p>And he looked forward to more nights with you, even if he lacked all the sleep and energy in the world. \u00a0\u00a0</p></p>",

I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d </p><p>After you hung up, Peter huffed as he headed in the right direction. </p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so stupid, Peter,\u201d he uttered to himself. </p><p>\u201cI thought that went well,\u201d Karen suddenly chimed in.</p><p>Peter thanked Karen and swung across the city, wasting no time to get back home. </p><hr><p>A knock fell upon Peter\u2019s apartment door and you waited patiently. You glanced down at the time on your phone and came ten minutes later than expected, knowing your friend had a habit of being late. Several loud, rummaging sounds later, a disheveled Peter putting on a loose grey sweater greeted you. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he beamed with a side smile. </p><p>Noting his chest heaving more than usual, you asked, \u201cJust got home from your run?\u201d </p><p>With widened eyes, he replied, \u201cUh\u2026 yeah!\u201d He leaned against the frame of the front door with crossed arms before running a hand through his hair. \u201cYeah, I just got home. You look nice.\u201d </p><p>Glancing down at yourself, you didn\u2019t think you looked any different than your usual self in your jeans, t-shirt, and with your backpack on. Nevertheless, his words made you smile like no tomorrow. \u201cThanks, Peter,\u201d you said while biting your lip. </p><p>Staring into each other\u2019s eyes, it took a moment for Peter to remember why you were there in the first place. He shook his head from his daze and welcomed you to come in. </p><p>You stepped into Peter\u2019s apartment and kicked off your shoes. Looking around, you still mentally photographed images of his place because you\u2019ve only been to Peter\u2019s place a few times before. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks again for letting me stay over.\u201d You adjusted your backpack, releasing one of the straps off your shoulder. \u201cSo, where will I be sleeping?\u201d </p><p>Quickly responding, Peter offered you his bed, while he insisted to stay on the living room couch. Shaking your head fervently, you exclaimed, \u201cNo, I can take the couch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. I can take the couch.\u201d With his thumbs in his front jean pockets, Peter rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet. \u201cMy bed\u2019s way comfier.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s more of a reason for me to take the couch than you, Peter,\u201d you commented as you made your way towards the couch, but in a blink of an eye, he stood in between you and the couch.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re my guest\u2014let me take the couch!\u201d</p><p>You pouted and argued, \u201cI\u2019ll take the couch!\u201d </p><p>Peter turned you around by your shoulders, having your back face him, and began to push you towards his room; your socks slid against the floor effortlessly. You tried your best to fight against the force, leaning back to create more difficulty, but your best friend was a lot stronger than he looked. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d You retorted, still trying to stop Peter from pushing you towards his room. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d </p><p>Grunting and not wanting to give up the fight, you crossed your arms and stomped on the floor. Peter stopped pushing you and gave in. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine, we can share the bed!\u201d One second later, Peter registered what he said. He immediately followed-up, \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re comfortable with that. I can also sleep on the floor if anything.\u201d</p><p>Content with the outcome, you willingly made your way to his bedroom with him following behind. \u201cNo one\u2019s sleeping on the floor, tonight, Peter.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Kneeling down beside your backpack, you began to unpack some of your items. \u201cAnd, like I said before, I\u2019m always comfortable with you. As long as you\u2019re okay with sharing the bed, then I\u2019m okay too.\u201d </p><p>When you looked up at Peter behind you, he was like a deer in the headlights. Nodding in agreement, he watched you get up and make your way to the bathroom with your toiletries in hand. Once you were out of sight, he leaned the back of his head against his bedroom wall and exhaled, frustrated that his heart palpitated harder than when he was normally with you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><hr><p>After ordering pizza for dinner and getting ready for bed, the two of you stood in front of Peter\u2019s full-sized bed. He mentally thanked himself that he disposed his twin-sized bed three months ago. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mentioned while watching you get into the bed, positioning yourself on the inside of the bed next to the wall.<b> \u201cThere\u2019s only one blanket.\u201d</b></p><p>You shrugged nonchalantly, sitting up on the bed as you adjusted the blanket and pillow for yourself. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to share,\u201d you faced the boy twiddling his fingers. Half-jokingly, you added, \u201cDon\u2019t hog it, please. I get cold in my sleep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Peter lowly whispered to himself before turning off the light\u2019s wall switch. </p><p>Carefully getting into bed, the boy kept himself near the edge of his bed. Both of you said your good nights to each other. After a few minutes, he glanced over to you huddled, leaning on side, and facing the wall. He turned his focus back to the ceiling like he normally did at night, except this time, he was stiff as a log. He already had a hard time sleeping nowadays; you being in the bed tonight did not help his problem at all. </p><p>Moments later, he figured you were already asleep when he heard your heart slowing down and some faint snoring. For the next few hours, Peter continued to stay wide awake. He kept on glancing at his phone\u2019s clock every now and then, closing his eyes, and tried his best to lull himself to sleep. Despite the fact there weren\u2019t any emergency alerts from his phone, he still considered going out to doing his nightly rounds around the city to tire himself out. But if you were to wake up in the middle of the night, he didn\u2019t want to leave his favorite girl alone. \u00a0</p><p>1:48am glowed against Peter\u2019s face before the hairs on his forearm stood up, feeling something was wrong. Your heart rate was suddenly spiking and he heard you mumbling in your sleep. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you groaned with closed eyes, prior to turning around to face the anxious boy. You began to shiver and frown intensely\u2014something Peter\u2019s never seen from you before. </p><p>\u201cI like you. Why won\u2019t you like me back?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He froze. Peter figured you were dreaming, but did he hear you correctly? On top of that, were you speaking words of truth, or simply saying things from a dream state? </p><p>Unsure of what to do, the concerned boy placed a hand on your shoulder and rubbed it tenderly. All of a sudden, you burst into tears, still not awake, and Peter immediately wrapped his arms around you, pulling your body into his. He began to soothe you and pet your head in the crook of his chest, telling you that it was going to be okay. Eventually, you woke up and realized you were crying in Peter\u2019s arms. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he called out your name in a hush tone, looking down at you in his arms. \u201cYou all right?\u201d </p><p>Still shaking, you managed to answer, \u201cI-I just had a bad dream, that\u2019s all.\u201d </p><p>You looked into Peter\u2019s eyes, recalling what occurred in your dream, yet unaware you were talking in your sleep and that Peter had heard your confession. In your dream, you confessed to Peter. Unfortunately, the Peter in your dream ignored you and didn\u2019t reply. You knew it was only a dream, but you believed it was a sign that maybe you should finally confess to Peter what you\u2019ve been feeling all this time. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d You whispered against his face, your minty breath the equivalent of a gust of wind. He was trying his best to focus on you. However, it didn\u2019t help that all he could think about was how your hair smelled fruity and sweet, like strawberries and peaches. God, he could drown in your scent forever. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The tips of your noses touched. You placed a hand on his beating chest, then soon grabbed a handful of his grey sweater. Eagerly, you pulled your crush into you, and gently pressed your lips against his. </p><p>His heart bursted at the seams, the fire in his heart flaring and oozing in each movement of the kiss. All the times he wondered what it\u2019d be like to kiss you were hitting him at 130 miles an hour and he didn\u2019t want to stop this beautiful incident. Peter\u2019s hands were still on your shoulders, holding onto you safely, feeling all the excitement overflowing in your veins too. \u00a0</p><p>The question on your mind had to be asked, so you forced yourself to pull away and blurted: </p><p>\u201cDo you like me?\u201d </p><p>At first, Peter didn\u2019t respond, still in shock over everything that was happening, so you continued, \u201cAs more than a friend?\u201d </p><p>He continued to stare blankly at you, but then gasped when the lightbulb moment happened\u2014you were the reason he couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\u00a0</p><p>Although Peter was aware that he liked you, he never realized it was why he couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he nodded excitedly with a shy laugh. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d </p><p>You nodded in response and had to pinch yourself to make sure that this wasn\u2019t still a dream. Both of you smiled brightly in the darkness of Peter\u2019s bedroom; you pulled him in again for another kiss. This time, the cognizant boy gained the courage to cup your face with his palms; the gentle pressure of the kiss juxtaposed his affectionate grip on you, not wanting to let you go. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Many kisses and little conversations followed and you two eventually passed out right before sunrise. </p><p>Albeit short, Peter hadn\u2019t had such a good, peaceful sleep in a while. </p><p>In retrospect, he never minded staying up all those nights. Nights filled with you made him feel alive, maybe even more than saving the city. </p><p>And he looked forward to more nights with you, even if he lacked all the sleep and energy in the world. \u00a0\u00a0</p></p>",

School, saving the city, and extracurriculars always tired him out at the end of each day. Every night, his bed would welcome him with open arms and he&rsquo;d fall face flat into his pillow, waking up energized once again in the morning. </p><p>But when the teacher assigned you to be his chemistry lab partner, his nights started to grow longer. </p><p>Then when you started to hang out with him, Ned, and Michelle outside of class, the nights became endless. </p><p>After his nightly escapades, he&rsquo;d stare at his bedroom ceiling, ruffling his dark chestnut hair and wonder why it was so hard to sleep nowadays. He&rsquo;d recount the occurrences throughout his day, but his thoughts always circled back to you, thinking what it&rsquo;d be like to lace his fingers with yours. Walk arm-in-arm with you down Midtown High&rsquo;s halls. Nudge his nose into your shoulder. Kiss your soft cheeks. </p><p>And, as always, he&rsquo;d smack himself with his pillow. </p><p>Peter still couldn&rsquo;t figure out why he couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night like he used to. </p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Hey, Peter?&rdquo; </p><p>In the iconic red and blue get-up, swinging from building to building on his way back home, Peter picked up your call via Karen, his trusty AI built within his suit. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he panted. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You sound out of breath. Am I calling at a bad time?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Peter practically screamed into his mask. &ldquo;No, I was just running&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. So, my parents are out of town for tonight and with all the recent break-ins in my building, I was wondering if I can stay with you for the night? Since you&rsquo;re the closest one to me?&rdquo; You asked Peter while curling your hair around your finger. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;d ask Michelle, but she lives across town.&rdquo; </p><p>Astounded, Peter fell mid-air, forgetting to shoot his webs keep him afloat. A moment later, he realized what was happening. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; He gasped, followed by a sharp thwip sound echoing through your end. Peter sighed in relief. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?! Did I say something wrong?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; The hero squeaked, shaking his head at himself. &ldquo;No, I just hit myself on something. I&rsquo;d love it&mdash;I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if you came over.&rdquo; </p><p>After he landed on top of a building, Peter rubbed his hand against the back of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;May isn&rsquo;t home tonight, so I&rsquo;m not sure if that makes you uncomfortable or not. I mean, not that I want to make you uncomfortable; I want to make sure you&rsquo;re comfortable! I&rsquo;m just saying that she isn&rsquo;t home.&rdquo; His hand moved from his neck to the front of his forehead, slapping it in the process.</p><p>Your bubbly laughter filled Peter&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine with me. You know I&rsquo;m always comfortable with you, Peter.&rdquo; His cheeks burned against the fabric of his mask. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be over in 15 minutes. Is that okay?&rdquo; </p><p>New York&rsquo;s friendly neighborhood hero noticed the sun setting in front of him, causing him to stop in his tracks. His head whipped around, realizing he had been going the opposite direction from home the entire time since you called.</p><p>&ldquo;Make it 30? If that&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good! Thanks for letting me stay with you.

Every night, his bed would welcome him with open arms and he&rsquo;d fall face flat into his pillow, waking up energized once again in the morning. </p>\n<p>But when the teacher assigned you to be his chemistry lab partner, his nights started to grow longer. </p>\n<p>Then when you started to hang out with him, Ned, and Michelle outside of class, the nights became endless. </p>\n<p>After his nightly escapades, he&rsquo;d stare at his bedroom ceiling, ruffling his dark chestnut hair and wonder why it was so hard to sleep nowadays. He&rsquo;d recount the occurrences throughout his day, but his thoughts always circled back to you, thinking what it&rsquo;d be like to lace his fingers with yours. Walk arm-in-arm with you down Midtown High&rsquo;s halls. Nudge his nose into your shoulder. Kiss your soft cheeks. </p>\n<p>And, as always, he&rsquo;d smack himself with his pillow. </p>\n<p>Peter still couldn&rsquo;t figure out why he couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night like he used to. </p>\n</p>",

So you decided to fly from London to see him, sneaking in the back of his hotel and having a security guard let you in. Sitting in the dark, you waited for him to show, waiting until he opened the door and turned the light on before responding,</p><p>&ldquo;<b>You look pretty hot in plaid</b>.&rdquo; You muttered, picking at your nails. Glancing up, Tom stared back wide eyed,</p><p>&ldquo;How did you&hellip;? Why are you&hellip; here?&rdquo; He asked breathlessly, watching you stand. You giggle, walking over to him, his arms bonding around you tightly,</p><p>&ldquo;I came to see my baby. He looks real tired and I thought I&rsquo;d come tuck him in.&rdquo; Pulling back, he stared down at you wide eyed,</p><p>&ldquo;My God, I missed you so much.&rdquo; Holding his cheeks, you smile,</p><p>&ldquo;I know baby. I&rsquo;m here now though. I&rsquo;m here for a few days so you can get some sleep.&rdquo; He sighed, </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can now that you&rsquo;re here. God I missed you.&rdquo; Holding you close, you rubbed his back,</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too baby boy.&rdquo; Careening backwards, you collapse onto the hotel&rsquo;s bed, Tom falling down next to you. Laying his head over your heart, he sighs again,</p><p>&ldquo;I hate being away from you like this. I just go through our pictures and wonder what you&rsquo;re up to but we&rsquo;re on such different time schedules that I know you&rsquo;re asleep. I just can&rsquo;t function without you.&rdquo; Rubbing his shoulders, he wraps you right in his arms, holding your body close to his,</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I love ya too Spider-Man. Get some sleep.&rdquo; But you didn&rsquo;t have to say it because in minutes, he was asleep in your arms. </p>",
