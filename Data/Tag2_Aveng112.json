But the group with Carol with them is now over-confident.

        "body": "<p>Captain Marvel gave me some new ideas about what might happen in Endgame. Spoilers, obviously.</p><!-- more --><p>All these ideas are still subject to change if Marvel was being misleading in any of their advertising, which is always a fair assumption.\u00a0</p><p>Since we see Carol show up at the Avengers compound in the first post-credit scene, I\u2019m assuming that she does not save Tony. It\u2019s still possible that she brought him back to Earth with her, and they just didn\u2019t want to reveal it, but now I\u2019m thinking Tony and Nebula find a way to rescue themselves. I also think that the shot in the Super Bowl spot that showed the Avengers outside looking up at something included Carol in the large blank space. I think it\u2019s most likely that they\u2019re looking at Tony arriving.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m guessing the post-credits scene takes place pretty soon after IW. I forget if Cap still had his beard, but he might have.\u00a0</p><p>CM also makes me think that the scene in the Super Bowl spot where Rhodey and Scott are in the compound getting prepared to fight is them facing maybe Loki or Strange. They seem like the most likely candidates for people who Rhodey and Scott would see as threats who could just appear inside the compound. They would both still consider Loki a villain. And I\u2019ve seen some theorizing that Strange didn\u2019t really get dusted, but instead astral projected or something. If he just showed up, it would make sense that Rhodey and Scott would be startled because they never met him.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s also the matter of Carol\u2019s powers. Having seen the movie, I agree with some concerns that I\u2019d seen prior to the release that she seems way overpowered compared to all the other characters, at least what\u2019s been shown in the movies so far. I feel like there are only two or three who could even come close among the heroes (Thor, Wanda, and maybe Strange). I think there are two main approaches to dealing with this problem. One is to have her basically win single-handedly and have the others be support. I think this approach would be a huge disservice to the 11 years of film making and characters that the MCU has built up. Fans would rightfully be angry. The other approach I could see is far more intriguing. Let it usher in a new era of the MCU where characters get their full powers.</p><p>My knowledge of the comics is extremely limited, but my understanding is that Wanda, for example, if given her full power set, would outmatch Carol. Therefore, I think Carol\u2019s introduction would be a great excuse to allow Wanda her full powers. It would also be a great reason not to nerf other powerful characters, like Vision. They\u2019ve already showed a drastic increase in Thor\u2019s powers, so he\u2019s good. This could also make room for the eventual introduction of other superpowered characters like the Fantastic Four and X-Men.\u00a0</p><p>The Russo brothers have said how they prefer more grounded stories and are not comfortable working with those kinds of powers. But seeing as Endgame is their last MCU movie, at least for a while, hopefully it acts as a transition to a grander set of powers and stories.</p><p>The idea of unlocking more powers for the characters brings me to a new possibility for what happened to the dusted characters. The main theories I\u2019ve seen is that they\u2019re in the soul world where we see Gamora at the end of IW, they\u2019re just gone, or they were sent to some sort of alternate universe. But what if they somehow ended up in the quantum realm? I\u2019m not sure how that would work exactly, but we have seen in Ant-Man and the Wasp that the quantum realm can unlock new abilities. So they could expand that further. I\u2019ve seen the theory that the quantum realm could allow the MCU to introduce X-Men, but I don\u2019t think that would happen yet because the deal isn\u2019t finalized yet.\u00a0</p><p>Regardless, I\u2019m super excited to see what happens.</p>",
