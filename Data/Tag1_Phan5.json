Jamie is there, as well as Mason and Sam, but \nthere\u2019s no sign of the pink haired sprite running around impulsively \ntoday. Dan replied to her messages as soon as he woke up, finally \nfeeling ready to face the reality of the night before. She didn\u2019t reply,\n but he wasn\u2019t bothered. He figured she was asleep and would come online\n by eleven, at the same time as Dan like she always does.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Woah!

Here to say your goodbyes?</p><p>Jamie\n gets her swords out and pokes Mason in the side, causing him to lose a \nthird of his health. Dan is thankful for it. They immediately start to \nbicker about not using weapons at home so Dan doesn\u2019t have to respond to\n the weird statement.</p><p>He has been getting replies in droves after \nSeagull replied to his tweet. People have been talking about it on the \nforum, too. The discussions Dan expected started, with people wanting to\n protect the forum while others are trolling, but the thread Dan was \nglued to all throughout breakfast was the one about the reply.</p><p>People\n are happy for him, and they\u2019re all curious about the fact that Seagull \nhas seen some of the fanart and fanfiction that the forum keeps mostly \nhidden. Some of it is widely appreciated. The family friendly fan \ncreations about the characters gets shared across platforms and Dan is \nfrankly impressed with some of it. There is a different, much more \nraunchy side of the community though, and those are always the threads \nDan goes to when he\u2019s in the mood to read fanfic.</p><p>He keeps it \nsecret, mostly. He doesn\u2019t talk about it publicly because he doesn\u2019t \nwant that to jeopardise the success of his servers, but the people that \ntake a closer look must know. Dan has read most if not all of the \nfanfiction out there about the two main male side characters in the \nstory. It is heavily implied that they are a couple but not explicitly \nstated, and the writers of the community have really run with that. \nThat\u2019s how Dan befriended Mason and Sam, anyway. Everyone knows they\u2019re \npart of his server. Everyone knows what they\u2019re known for, because \nunlike Dan they aren\u2019t shy talking publicly about the queer undertones \nin Fall Whisperer.</p><p>The thread was mostly joking about it, certain \nthat Seagull wasn\u2019t serious with his reply. He can\u2019t have seen the \nexplicit writing and art, they write. In order to find it you have to \nsearch for it, and why would the writer of the storyline intentionally \nseek out smut about his own creation? The queerness wasn\u2019t intentional, \nafter all. That\u2019s only the stuff that fanboys and fangirls want to \nbelieve because nowadays everything just has to be gay.</p><p>Dan kind \nof hates that he is part of that discussion now. He tweeted it as a \njoke, not expecting a reply. He was mostly poking at Sam and Mason, \nbecause they of all people know that he\u2019s the opposite of disgusted by \ntheir brilliant writing. Dan didn\u2019t take Seagull\u2019s response seriously, \nbut he\u2019s sure he must have seen some of it. Dan doesn\u2019t speculate \noutside of his personal conversations with his server friends and they \nall agreed that Seagull can\u2019t be straight. He isn\u2019t out, though, so Dan \nexited out of the discussion before he finished reading all of it in \norder to keep his sanity.</p><p>Once Mason and Jamie stop bickering Dan \nhelps out with the excessive weeds. Turns out yesterday\u2019s crystal hunt \nin the caves made them forget to do the housekeeping.</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: it\u2019s not like anyone cares that i was the one he replied to</p><p>He\n needs to talk about it. As much as Dan wants to keep it locked for a \nlittle while longer while he processes it himself, he knows it\u2019s better \nto face head on. In this server, in his safe place, that is something he\n can do.</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: That\u2019s true. It is pretty amazing though. He never replies.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: He was probably drunk, searching for inspiration by reading Caved Into Feeling</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: ???? aaaassss iffff</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>:\n a bottle of red + crying over dye and white falling in love while they \nhave to fuck to keep warm when they\u2019re trapped in the cave? been there</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: hahaa chrome &lt;33</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Love that me trying to be smutty turned into people crying over the fic anyway</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: everyone loves a sad wank</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: as does seagull, hence the tweet</p><p>Dan has to cover his mouth not to burst out laughing.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: I should change the summary to \u201cAre you into crying and jerking off simultaneously? Then this fic is for you! \u201d</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: Can you imagine the hate? Someone would definitely get it taken down.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: I did it.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Meh, the story\u2019s been up for two years. It\u2019s time.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: anyone new to the fandom must be so confused right now</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: speaking of, anyone know where morgan is?</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: idk, we talked earlier and she seemed fine but it\u2019s weird she isn\u2019t here. Probably busy with irl stuff?</p><p>Dan\n knows what it means when Morgan is \u201cbusy\u201d with \u201cirl stuff\u201d and it makes\n his stomach twist anxiously. She was so happy last night. Because of \nthe tweet, and then for Dan. Showering him in positivity and \ncongratulations that, while excessive, put a smile on his face. If Dan \never wants to feel appreciated, he knows who to turn to. It\u2019s easy to \nforget about the conversations they have sometimes, normally late at \nnight when Dan is in a low, and the things Morgan tells him and that he \nis surprised they have in common.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: She updated her art thread!</p><p>Dan\n immediately tabs over to his web browser. He\u2019s met with the forum \nthread he read last, and being reminded he clicks backspace as fast as \nhe can to get to the main forum page. He goes to her thread, starred on \nthe front page as the last one updated, and gets to her recent post.</p><p>Morgan\n never posts at this time. She waits until late at night, when the \nAmericans are awake, because she says they\u2019re always more excited about \nher work and she needs that when she\u2019s nervous about posting.</p><p>Either she isn\u2019t nervous today, or she was inspired enough to post as soon as possible.</p><p>It\u2019s\n another comedy cartoon. Dan can tell by the quirky colourful banner on \ntop. Her more serious artwork never has that banner. This one depicts \nSeagull, appropriately visualised as a cartoonish, exaggerated seagull \nwith flappy wings and a long beak and fluttery eyelashes. The only thing\n that sets it apart from just any seagull is the black quiff on its \nhead, as it is one of the few descriptors more widely known in the \nfandom after he talked about it in a written down interview.</p><p>The \nseagull is standing on a stage, speaking the tweet from last night into a\n megaphone. In the next frame, the audience full of pixelated Fall \nWhisperer style sprites cheer and pink hearts float up from every single\n person. It\u2019s very detailed for her comics. In the next frame, replies \nbubble up but they overlap more and more for every new page until the \ntext becomes one big mess of black ink.</p><p>Then, a dramatic picture \nof a pixely foot stepping onto a stair step. The next, a closed fist. In\n the third, she has drawn a wide shot of Dan\u2019s sprite standing on a \nplatform in the middle of the audience with a megaphone of his own, \nshouting out his own tweet.</p><p>Seagull responds, and in the next \npicture Dan\u2019s sprite has fallen to his knees whilst drooling comically \nand his eyes have been replaced with pretty pink hearts as he stutters \nout the second, ignored response. Dan shifts in his seat. He doesn\u2019t \nknow what to think about it, until he does. Because his eyes pan down to\n the last picture.</p><p>It\u2019s written in large cursive letters:</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>\n \u00a0 \u00a0<b>achromatic_bot &lt;3 seagull</b>\n \u00a0</i>\n</p><p>There are no responses to it yet, and Dan is scared to refresh \nthe page. Morgan doesn\u2019t ask for approval before she makes or shares her\n cartoons. She doesn\u2019t have to, because nothing she\u2019s ever posted had \nbeen personal or embarrassing. This is personal and embarrassing. Dan \nfights the thought and how his face burns with shame, knowing Morgan \nknows how much it means to him. If she posted this in their server group\n conversation, that would be one thing. Everyone would poke fun at Dan \nand Dan would take it in stride, because on the one hand it is funny.</p><p>It\n loses its humour when it\u2019s there for everyone else to see, immortalised\n on the internet forever. Dan takes the step and refreshes the page. \nThere\u2019s a reason she doesn\u2019t post around noon, because this is the time \nwhen the most annoying people are online.</p><p>&gt; of course he\u2019s just another fanboy getting off on the whole dye/white thing SIGH</p><p>&gt; lol this is an exaggeration right? Like obviously chrome would be excited to interact with Seagull but not like that?</p><p>&gt; CUTE &lt;3 how the fuck do i suddenly ship two guys i don\u2019t know the names OR faces of? Doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m into it!</p><p>&gt; @achromatic_bot is gay confirmed?</p><p>&gt; yo how has everyone missed that squigglyfw and onebitwonder are in his private server? Everyone knows what they do\u2026</p><p>&gt; ^ that\u2019s true, wow, i never thought about it</p><p>&gt; SUSPICION INCREASES</p><p>The\n comments go on in the same vein. Dan clicks out. He logs out of the \ngame and turns off his computer. He looks out the window, at the brick \nwall facing it, as his heart drops to the pit of his stomach.</p><p>It\u2019s\n only half past noon. His schedule allows him to keep playing until his \nalarm rings at quarter past three, but Dan doesn\u2019t want to. The world is\n tilted to its side and any plans he has had for the server today seem \nstupid, as meaningless as placing a window to face a brick wall.</p><p>Dan\u2019s phone buzzes and he looks. It\u2019s Jamie, of course.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: she says she\u2019s sorry and that she\u2019s going to delete it</p><p>What\n has it been, half an hour since she posted it? Half an hour of Dan \nrefreshing time and time again and finding nothing but comments debating\n what kind of a fan he is, and whether he is gay or not? Dan was hiding \nin plain sight, but now he wishes he had stuck to just hiding. </p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: sorry about what</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: i thought you saw? since you logged off and everything. did your pc mess up?</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: i saw but that\u2019s not why i logged out irl is getting in the way of things</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: so you\u2019re not upset?</p><p>Why\n won\u2019t she let him evade the topic until he\u2019s feeling less chaotic about\n the whole thing? If Dan was at another point in life, before he learned\n how to count to ten before exploding, he would have deleted his account\n by now and left the community that has built him up for the last three \nyears. He has the impulse to do it. It would be so easy.</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: dw about me lol it\u2019s just a cartoon</p><p>She\n keeps messaging him after that, but Dan turns on flight mode and puts \nhis phone away. Jamie is a snarky bitch and a funny one at that. Dan \nrelates to her and they bounce off one another brilliantly when they\u2019re \nboth in the right mood for it. When it comes to things like these, they \ndon\u2019t work. Jamie thinks Dan\u2019s avoidance means he hates all of them and \nshe has no problem with immediately painting him as some sort of villain\n because of it. That, paired with her instinct to defend Morgan, has \nmade for some messy arguments that Dan had thought belonged to the past.</p><p>They\u2019ve\n talked it out. Dan has explained why he disappears when he\u2019s upset \nabout something. When he tells her, she acts like she understands. She \nnever, ever apologises, though. It seems she\u2019s learned nothing. Dan is \ndone with teaching her.</p><p>-</p><p>Amazingly, Dan makes it to work. \nEvery fibre of his being is begging him to call in sick, even as he \nchanges into his scrubs and makes his way to the reception. It\u2019s like an\n itch inside, a discontentment settled so deeply within that he wants to\n rip his skin off to get to the source and throw it to the side. It \nwouldn\u2019t work. Dan can\u2019t dig deep enough to get there. All he can do \nwhen he feels like this is to sit in it. Acknowledge it. Susanne says \nthat that is the healthy thing to do.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t feel healthy \nwhen he gets in a minor spat with a patient about their next booked \nvisit. He can\u2019t book it for them, they have to take it up with the \ndoctor, is what he keeps telling them. All the while, they insist he \nbooks it into the system because that doctor has forgotten to before.</p><p>Dan wants to smash his fist in the glass window and watch it shatter into a billion little pieces.</p><p>Instead,\n he promises to email the doctor to remind him to put in their next \nvisit after the patient leaves. That doesn\u2019t satisfy them in the least, \ngiven the sour look on their face, but at least they drop it and Dan can\n stop fighting to keep the friendly smile on his face instead of \nthrowing a fit.</p><p>Nothing stops feeling wrong even by the end of his\n shift. Normally, Dan would be overjoyed right now. It\u2019s Friday, he\u2019s \nfree, and tomorrow he has the dinner with his friends to look forward \nto. Dan doesn\u2019t feel free. He feels absolutely indifferent to returning \nto his flat. He can\u2019t process anything, he has no idea who to turn to, \nand he\u2019s a problem.</p><p>If he talks to Mason or Sam they\u2019ll have his \nback, but they will start shit talking Jamie and Morgan at the same \ntime. If he talks to Jamie, she\u2019ll keep insisting on defending Morgan \nand villainising Dan. </p><p>That leaves Morgan.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t feel \nscared walking the streets of London tonight. People are outside \nwreaking havoc to celebrate the start of the weekend, but even as Dan \nwalks past two men drunkenly swinging at each other as a joke he remains\n unfazed. On another day, during a normal night, that would be a \nvictory. Tonight it isn\u2019t. Tonight Dan finds himself wishing someone \nwould try something so he could get a physical outlet for his \nfrustrations.</p><p>Dan does make tea once he\u2019s home, but skips the \nsandwich. It isn\u2019t until he sits down on his desk chair, warm cup in \nhand, that he realises he forgot to change into his pyjamas. Exhaustion \nreplaces everything else in that moment. Dan puts his tea down on the \ndesk and gets up from the chair. He pulls down the blinds on his \nmeaningless window and strips down to his underwear. Without brushing \nhis teeth he gets under the covers in his neatly made bed and closes his\n eyes for sleep.</p>",

Normally, Dan would be overjoyed right now. It\u2019s Friday, he\u2019s \nfree, and tomorrow he has the dinner with his friends to look forward \nto. Dan doesn\u2019t feel free.

If he talks to Jamie, she\u2019ll keep insisting on defending Morgan \nand villainising Dan. </p><p>That leaves Morgan.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t feel \nscared walking the streets of London tonight. People are outside \nwreaking havoc to celebrate the start of the weekend, but even as Dan \nwalks past two men drunkenly swinging at each other as a joke he remains\n unfazed. On another day, during a normal night, that would be a \nvictory. Tonight it isn\u2019t. Tonight Dan finds himself wishing someone \nwould try something so he could get a physical outlet for his \nfrustrations.</p><p>Dan does make tea once he\u2019s home, but skips the \nsandwich. It isn\u2019t until he sits down on his desk chair, warm cup in \nhand, that he realises he forgot to change into his pyjamas. Exhaustion \nreplaces everything else in that moment. Dan puts his tea down on the \ndesk and gets up from the chair. He pulls down the blinds on his \nmeaningless window and strips down to his underwear. Without brushing \nhis teeth he gets under the covers in his neatly made bed and closes his\n eyes for sleep.</p></p>",

(6k words so far)</p><p><b>summary:</b> When you build your life out of fear that your mental illness could \nworsen, it leaves little room for excitement. Luckily, Dan has found a \nspace online where he feels comfortable. </p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19253134/chapters/45992989\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> \u00a0or keep reading below the cut!</p>[[MORE]]<p>When Dan opens up their personal server the next day Morgan is \nnowhere to be found. Jamie is there, as well as Mason and Sam, but \nthere\u2019s no sign of the pink haired sprite running around impulsively \ntoday. Dan replied to her messages as soon as he woke up, finally \nfeeling ready to face the reality of the night before. She didn\u2019t reply,\n but he wasn\u2019t bothered. He figured she was asleep and would come online\n by eleven, at the same time as Dan like she always does.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Woah! What are you doing here, chrome?</p><p>The\n three of them are getting rid of weeds growing inside the house when \nDan enters their cabin after dropping some of his self earned gold in \nthe teams\u2019 shared money well.</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: i should ask you that isn\u2019t it really late in america</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Figure you\u2019re too famous for us now? Here to say your goodbyes?</p><p>Jamie\n gets her swords out and pokes Mason in the side, causing him to lose a \nthird of his health. Dan is thankful for it. They immediately start to \nbicker about not using weapons at home so Dan doesn\u2019t have to respond to\n the weird statement.</p><p>He has been getting replies in droves after \nSeagull replied to his tweet. People have been talking about it on the \nforum, too. The discussions Dan expected started, with people wanting to\n protect the forum while others are trolling, but the thread Dan was \nglued to all throughout breakfast was the one about the reply.</p><p>People\n are happy for him, and they\u2019re all curious about the fact that Seagull \nhas seen some of the fanart and fanfiction that the forum keeps mostly \nhidden. Some of it is widely appreciated. The family friendly fan \ncreations about the characters gets shared across platforms and Dan is \nfrankly impressed with some of it. There is a different, much more \nraunchy side of the community though, and those are always the threads \nDan goes to when he\u2019s in the mood to read fanfic.</p><p>He keeps it \nsecret, mostly. He doesn\u2019t talk about it publicly because he doesn\u2019t \nwant that to jeopardise the success of his servers, but the people that \ntake a closer look must know. Dan has read most if not all of the \nfanfiction out there about the two main male side characters in the \nstory. It is heavily implied that they are a couple but not explicitly \nstated, and the writers of the community have really run with that. \nThat\u2019s how Dan befriended Mason and Sam, anyway. Everyone knows they\u2019re \npart of his server. Everyone knows what they\u2019re known for, because \nunlike Dan they aren\u2019t shy talking publicly about the queer undertones \nin Fall Whisperer.</p><p>The thread was mostly joking about it, certain \nthat Seagull wasn\u2019t serious with his reply. He can\u2019t have seen the \nexplicit writing and art, they write. In order to find it you have to \nsearch for it, and why would the writer of the storyline intentionally \nseek out smut about his own creation? The queerness wasn\u2019t intentional, \nafter all. That\u2019s only the stuff that fanboys and fangirls want to \nbelieve because nowadays everything just has to be gay.</p><p>Dan kind \nof hates that he is part of that discussion now. He tweeted it as a \njoke, not expecting a reply. He was mostly poking at Sam and Mason, \nbecause they of all people know that he\u2019s the opposite of disgusted by \ntheir brilliant writing. Dan didn\u2019t take Seagull\u2019s response seriously, \nbut he\u2019s sure he must have seen some of it. Dan doesn\u2019t speculate \noutside of his personal conversations with his server friends and they \nall agreed that Seagull can\u2019t be straight. He isn\u2019t out, though, so Dan \nexited out of the discussion before he finished reading all of it in \norder to keep his sanity.</p><p>Once Mason and Jamie stop bickering Dan \nhelps out with the excessive weeds. Turns out yesterday\u2019s crystal hunt \nin the caves made them forget to do the housekeeping.</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: it\u2019s not like anyone cares that i was the one he replied to</p><p>He\n needs to talk about it. As much as Dan wants to keep it locked for a \nlittle while longer while he processes it himself, he knows it\u2019s better \nto face head on. In this server, in his safe place, that is something he\n can do.</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: That\u2019s true. It is pretty amazing though. He never replies.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: He was probably drunk, searching for inspiration by reading Caved Into Feeling</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: ???? aaaassss iffff</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>:\n a bottle of red + crying over dye and white falling in love while they \nhave to fuck to keep warm when they\u2019re trapped in the cave? been there</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: hahaa chrome &lt;33</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Love that me trying to be smutty turned into people crying over the fic anyway</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: everyone loves a sad wank</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: as does seagull, hence the tweet</p><p>Dan has to cover his mouth not to burst out laughing.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: I should change the summary to \u201cAre you into crying and jerking off simultaneously? Then this fic is for you! \u201d</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: Can you imagine the hate? Someone would definitely get it taken down.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: I did it.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Meh, the story\u2019s been up for two years. It\u2019s time.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: anyone new to the fandom must be so confused right now</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: speaking of, anyone know where morgan is?</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: idk, we talked earlier and she seemed fine but it\u2019s weird she isn\u2019t here. Probably busy with irl stuff?</p><p>Dan\n knows what it means when Morgan is \u201cbusy\u201d with \u201cirl stuff\u201d and it makes\n his stomach twist anxiously. She was so happy last night. Because of \nthe tweet, and then for Dan. Showering him in positivity and \ncongratulations that, while excessive, put a smile on his face. If Dan \never wants to feel appreciated, he knows who to turn to. It\u2019s easy to \nforget about the conversations they have sometimes, normally late at \nnight when Dan is in a low, and the things Morgan tells him and that he \nis surprised they have in common.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: She updated her art thread!</p><p>Dan\n immediately tabs over to his web browser. He\u2019s met with the forum \nthread he read last, and being reminded he clicks backspace as fast as \nhe can to get to the main forum page. He goes to her thread, starred on \nthe front page as the last one updated, and gets to her recent post.</p><p>Morgan\n never posts at this time. She waits until late at night, when the \nAmericans are awake, because she says they\u2019re always more excited about \nher work and she needs that when she\u2019s nervous about posting.</p><p>Either she isn\u2019t nervous today, or she was inspired enough to post as soon as possible.</p><p>It\u2019s\n another comedy cartoon. Dan can tell by the quirky colourful banner on \ntop. Her more serious artwork never has that banner. This one depicts \nSeagull, appropriately visualised as a cartoonish, exaggerated seagull \nwith flappy wings and a long beak and fluttery eyelashes. The only thing\n that sets it apart from just any seagull is the black quiff on its \nhead, as it is one of the few descriptors more widely known in the \nfandom after he talked about it in a written down interview.</p><p>The \nseagull is standing on a stage, speaking the tweet from last night into a\n megaphone. In the next frame, the audience full of pixelated Fall \nWhisperer style sprites cheer and pink hearts float up from every single\n person. It\u2019s very detailed for her comics. In the next frame, replies \nbubble up but they overlap more and more for every new page until the \ntext becomes one big mess of black ink.</p><p>Then, a dramatic picture \nof a pixely foot stepping onto a stair step. The next, a closed fist. In\n the third, she has drawn a wide shot of Dan\u2019s sprite standing on a \nplatform in the middle of the audience with a megaphone of his own, \nshouting out his own tweet.</p><p>Seagull responds, and in the next \npicture Dan\u2019s sprite has fallen to his knees whilst drooling comically \nand his eyes have been replaced with pretty pink hearts as he stutters \nout the second, ignored response. Dan shifts in his seat. He doesn\u2019t \nknow what to think about it, until he does. Because his eyes pan down to\n the last picture.</p><p>It\u2019s written in large cursive letters:</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>\n \u00a0 \u00a0<b>achromatic_bot &lt;3 seagull</b>\n \u00a0</i>\n</p><p>There are no responses to it yet, and Dan is scared to refresh \nthe page. Morgan doesn\u2019t ask for approval before she makes or shares her\n cartoons. She doesn\u2019t have to, because nothing she\u2019s ever posted had \nbeen personal or embarrassing.

On another day, during a normal night, that would be a \nvictory. Tonight it isn\u2019t. Tonight Dan finds himself wishing someone \nwould try something so he could get a physical outlet for his \nfrustrations.</p><p>Dan does make tea once he\u2019s home, but skips the \nsandwich. It isn\u2019t until he sits down on his desk chair, warm cup in \nhand, that he realises he forgot to change into his pyjamas. Exhaustion \nreplaces everything else in that moment. Dan puts his tea down on the \ndesk and gets up from the chair. He pulls down the blinds on his \nmeaningless window and strips down to his underwear. Without brushing \nhis teeth he gets under the covers in his neatly made bed and closes his\n eyes for sleep.</p></p>",

(6k words so far)</p><p><b>summary:</b> When you build your life out of fear that your mental illness could \nworsen, it leaves little room for excitement. Luckily, Dan has found a \nspace online where he feels comfortable. </p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19253134/chapters/45992989\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> &nbsp;or keep reading below the cut!</p><p>When Dan opens up their personal server the next day Morgan is \nnowhere to be found. Jamie is there, as well as Mason and Sam, but \nthere&rsquo;s no sign of the pink haired sprite running around impulsively \ntoday. Dan replied to her messages as soon as he woke up, finally \nfeeling ready to face the reality of the night before. She didn&rsquo;t reply,\n but he wasn&rsquo;t bothered. He figured she was asleep and would come online\n by eleven, at the same time as Dan like she always does.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Woah! What are you doing here, chrome?</p><p>The\n three of them are getting rid of weeds growing inside the house when \nDan enters their cabin after dropping some of his self earned gold in \nthe teams&rsquo; shared money well.</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: i should ask you that isn&rsquo;t it really late in america</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Figure you&rsquo;re too famous for us now? Here to say your goodbyes?</p><p>Jamie\n gets her swords out and pokes Mason in the side, causing him to lose a \nthird of his health. Dan is thankful for it. They immediately start to \nbicker about not using weapons at home so Dan doesn&rsquo;t have to respond to\n the weird statement.</p><p>He has been getting replies in droves after \nSeagull replied to his tweet. People have been talking about it on the \nforum, too. The discussions Dan expected started, with people wanting to\n protect the forum while others are trolling, but the thread Dan was \nglued to all throughout breakfast was the one about the reply.</p><p>People\n are happy for him, and they&rsquo;re all curious about the fact that Seagull \nhas seen some of the fanart and fanfiction that the forum keeps mostly \nhidden. Some of it is widely appreciated. The family friendly fan \ncreations about the characters gets shared across platforms and Dan is \nfrankly impressed with some of it. There is a different, much more \nraunchy side of the community though, and those are always the threads \nDan goes to when he&rsquo;s in the mood to read fanfic.</p><p>He keeps it \nsecret, mostly. He doesn&rsquo;t talk about it publicly because he doesn&rsquo;t \nwant that to jeopardise the success of his servers, but the people that \ntake a closer look must know. Dan has read most if not all of the \nfanfiction out there about the two main male side characters in the \nstory. It is heavily implied that they are a couple but not explicitly \nstated, and the writers of the community have really run with that. \nThat&rsquo;s how Dan befriended Mason and Sam, anyway. Everyone knows they&rsquo;re \npart of his server. Everyone knows what they&rsquo;re known for, because \nunlike Dan they aren&rsquo;t shy talking publicly about the queer undertones \nin Fall Whisperer.</p><p>The thread was mostly joking about it, certain \nthat Seagull wasn&rsquo;t serious with his reply. He can&rsquo;t have seen the \nexplicit writing and art, they write. In order to find it you have to \nsearch for it, and why would the writer of the storyline intentionally \nseek out smut about his own creation? The queerness wasn&rsquo;t intentional, \nafter all. That&rsquo;s only the stuff that fanboys and fangirls want to \nbelieve because nowadays everything just has to be gay.</p><p>Dan kind \nof hates that he is part of that discussion now. He tweeted it as a \njoke, not expecting a reply. He was mostly poking at Sam and Mason, \nbecause they of all people know that he&rsquo;s the opposite of disgusted by \ntheir brilliant writing. Dan didn&rsquo;t take Seagull&rsquo;s response seriously, \nbut he&rsquo;s sure he must have seen some of it. Dan doesn&rsquo;t speculate \noutside of his personal conversations with his server friends and they \nall agreed that Seagull can&rsquo;t be straight. He isn&rsquo;t out, though, so Dan \nexited out of the discussion before he finished reading all of it in \norder to keep his sanity.</p><p>Once Mason and Jamie stop bickering Dan \nhelps out with the excessive weeds. Turns out yesterday&rsquo;s crystal hunt \nin the caves made them forget to do the housekeeping.</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: it&rsquo;s not like anyone cares that i was the one he replied to</p><p>He\n needs to talk about it. As much as Dan wants to keep it locked for a \nlittle while longer while he processes it himself, he knows it&rsquo;s better \nto face head on. In this server, in his safe place, that is something he\n can do.</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: That&rsquo;s true. It is pretty amazing though. He never replies.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: He was probably drunk, searching for inspiration by reading Caved Into Feeling</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: ???? aaaassss iffff</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>:\n a bottle of red + crying over dye and white falling in love while they \nhave to fuck to keep warm when they&rsquo;re trapped in the cave? been there</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: hahaa chrome &lt;33</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Love that me trying to be smutty turned into people crying over the fic anyway</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: everyone loves a sad wank</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: as does seagull, hence the tweet</p><p>Dan has to cover his mouth not to burst out laughing.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: I should change the summary to &ldquo;Are you into crying and jerking off simultaneously? Then this fic is for you! &rdquo;</p><p><b>squigglyfw</b>: Can you imagine the hate? Someone would definitely get it taken down.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: I did it.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: Meh, the story&rsquo;s been up for two years. It&rsquo;s time.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: anyone new to the fandom must be so confused right now</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: speaking of, anyone know where morgan is?</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: idk, we talked earlier and she seemed fine but it&rsquo;s weird she isn&rsquo;t here. Probably busy with irl stuff?</p><p>Dan\n knows what it means when Morgan is &ldquo;busy&rdquo; with &ldquo;irl stuff&rdquo; and it makes\n his stomach twist anxiously. She was so happy last night. Because of \nthe tweet, and then for Dan. Showering him in positivity and \ncongratulations that, while excessive, put a smile on his face. If Dan \never wants to feel appreciated, he knows who to turn to. It&rsquo;s easy to \nforget about the conversations they have sometimes, normally late at \nnight when Dan is in a low, and the things Morgan tells him and that he \nis surprised they have in common.</p><p><b>onebitwonder</b>: She updated her art thread!</p><p>Dan\n immediately tabs over to his web browser. He&rsquo;s met with the forum \nthread he read last, and being reminded he clicks backspace as fast as \nhe can to get to the main forum page. He goes to her thread, starred on \nthe front page as the last one updated, and gets to her recent post.</p><p>Morgan\n never posts at this time. She waits until late at night, when the \nAmericans are awake, because she says they&rsquo;re always more excited about \nher work and she needs that when she&rsquo;s nervous about posting.</p><p>Either she isn&rsquo;t nervous today, or she was inspired enough to post as soon as possible.</p><p>It&rsquo;s\n another comedy cartoon. Dan can tell by the quirky colourful banner on \ntop. Her more serious artwork never has that banner. This one depicts \nSeagull, appropriately visualised as a cartoonish, exaggerated seagull \nwith flappy wings and a long beak and fluttery eyelashes. The only thing\n that sets it apart from just any seagull is the black quiff on its \nhead, as it is one of the few descriptors more widely known in the \nfandom after he talked about it in a written down interview.</p><p>The \nseagull is standing on a stage, speaking the tweet from last night into a\n megaphone. In the next frame, the audience full of pixelated Fall \nWhisperer style sprites cheer and pink hearts float up from every single\n person. It&rsquo;s very detailed for her comics. In the next frame, replies \nbubble up but they overlap more and more for every new page until the \ntext becomes one big mess of black ink.</p><p>Then, a dramatic picture \nof a pixely foot stepping onto a stair step. The next, a closed fist. In\n the third, she has drawn a wide shot of Dan&rsquo;s sprite standing on a \nplatform in the middle of the audience with a megaphone of his own, \nshouting out his own tweet.</p><p>Seagull responds, and in the next \npicture Dan&rsquo;s sprite has fallen to his knees whilst drooling comically \nand his eyes have been replaced with pretty pink hearts as he stutters \nout the second, ignored response. Dan shifts in his seat. He doesn&rsquo;t \nknow what to think about it, until he does. Because his eyes pan down to\n the last picture.</p><p>It&rsquo;s written in large cursive letters:</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>\n &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>achromatic_bot &lt;3 seagull</b>\n &nbsp;</i>\n</p><p>There are no responses to it yet, and Dan is scared to refresh \nthe page. Morgan doesn&rsquo;t ask for approval before she makes or shares her\n cartoons. She doesn&rsquo;t have to, because nothing she&rsquo;s ever posted had \nbeen personal or embarrassing. This is personal and embarrassing. Dan \nfights the thought and how his face burns with shame, knowing Morgan \nknows how much it means to him. If she posted this in their server group\n conversation, that would be one thing. Everyone would poke fun at Dan \nand Dan would take it in stride, because on the one hand it is funny.</p><p>It\n loses its humour when it&rsquo;s there for everyone else to see, immortalised\n on the internet forever. Dan takes the step and refreshes the page. \nThere&rsquo;s a reason she doesn&rsquo;t post around noon, because this is the time \nwhen the most annoying people are online.</p><p>&gt; of course he&rsquo;s just another fanboy getting off on the whole dye/white thing SIGH</p><p>&gt; lol this is an exaggeration right? Like obviously chrome would be excited to interact with Seagull but not like that?</p><p>&gt; CUTE &lt;3 how the fuck do i suddenly ship two guys i don&rsquo;t know the names OR faces of? Doesn&rsquo;t matter, I&rsquo;m into it!</p><p>&gt; @achromatic_bot is gay confirmed?</p><p>&gt; yo how has everyone missed that squigglyfw and onebitwonder are in his private server? Everyone knows what they do&hellip;</p><p>&gt; ^ that&rsquo;s true, wow, i never thought about it</p><p>&gt; SUSPICION INCREASES</p><p>The\n comments go on in the same vein. Dan clicks out. He logs out of the \ngame and turns off his computer. He looks out the window, at the brick \nwall facing it, as his heart drops to the pit of his stomach.</p><p>It&rsquo;s\n only half past noon. His schedule allows him to keep playing until his \nalarm rings at quarter past three, but Dan doesn&rsquo;t want to. The world is\n tilted to its side and any plans he has had for the server today seem \nstupid, as meaningless as placing a window to face a brick wall.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s phone buzzes and he looks. It&rsquo;s Jamie, of course.</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: she says she&rsquo;s sorry and that she&rsquo;s going to delete it</p><p>What\n has it been, half an hour since she posted it? Half an hour of Dan \nrefreshing time and time again and finding nothing but comments debating\n what kind of a fan he is, and whether he is gay or not? Dan was hiding \nin plain sight, but now he wishes he had stuck to just hiding. </p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: sorry about what</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: i thought you saw? since you logged off and everything. did your pc mess up?</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: i saw but that&rsquo;s not why i logged out irl is getting in the way of things</p><p><b>ripewhisperer</b>: so you&rsquo;re not upset?</p><p>Why\n won&rsquo;t she let him evade the topic until he&rsquo;s feeling less chaotic about\n the whole thing? If Dan was at another point in life, before he learned\n how to count to ten before exploding, he would have deleted his account\n by now and left the community that has built him up for the last three \nyears. He has the impulse to do it. It would be so easy.</p><p><b>achromatic_bot</b>: dw about me lol it&rsquo;s just a cartoon</p><p>She\n keeps messaging him after that, but Dan turns on flight mode and puts \nhis phone away. Jamie is a snarky bitch and a funny one at that. Dan \nrelates to her and they bounce off one another brilliantly when they&rsquo;re \nboth in the right mood for it. When it comes to things like these, they \ndon&rsquo;t work. Jamie thinks Dan&rsquo;s avoidance means he hates all of them and \nshe has no problem with immediately painting him as some sort of villain\n because of it. That, paired with her instinct to defend Morgan, has \nmade for some messy arguments that Dan had thought belonged to the past.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve\n talked it out. Dan has explained why he disappears when he&rsquo;s upset \nabout something. When he tells her, she acts like she understands. She \nnever, ever apologises, though. It seems she&rsquo;s learned nothing. Dan is \ndone with teaching her.</p><p>-</p><p>Amazingly, Dan makes it to work. \nEvery fibre of his being is begging him to call in sick, even as he \nchanges into his scrubs and makes his way to the reception. It&rsquo;s like an\n itch inside, a discontentment settled so deeply within that he wants to\n rip his skin off to get to the source and throw it to the side. It \nwouldn&rsquo;t work. Dan can&rsquo;t dig deep enough to get there. All he can do \nwhen he feels like this is to sit in it. Acknowledge it. Susanne says \nthat that is the healthy thing to do.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t feel healthy \nwhen he gets in a minor spat with a patient about their next booked \nvisit. He can&rsquo;t book it for them, they have to take it up with the \ndoctor, is what he keeps telling them. All the while, they insist he \nbooks it into the system because that doctor has forgotten to before.</p><p>Dan wants to smash his fist in the glass window and watch it shatter into a billion little pieces.</p><p>Instead,\n he promises to email the doctor to remind him to put in their next \nvisit after the patient leaves. That doesn&rsquo;t satisfy them in the least, \ngiven the sour look on their face, but at least they drop it and Dan can\n stop fighting to keep the friendly smile on his face instead of \nthrowing a fit.</p><p>Nothing stops feeling wrong even by the end of his\n shift. Normally, Dan would be overjoyed right now. It&rsquo;s Friday, he&rsquo;s \nfree, and tomorrow he has the dinner with his friends to look forward \nto. Dan doesn&rsquo;t feel free. He feels absolutely indifferent to returning \nto his flat. He can&rsquo;t process anything, he has no idea who to turn to, \nand he&rsquo;s a problem.</p><p>If he talks to Mason or Sam they&rsquo;ll have his \nback, but they will start shit talking Jamie and Morgan at the same \ntime. If he talks to Jamie, she&rsquo;ll keep insisting on defending Morgan \nand villainising Dan. </p><p>That leaves Morgan.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t feel \nscared walking the streets of London tonight. People are outside \nwreaking havoc to celebrate the start of the weekend, but even as Dan \nwalks past two men drunkenly swinging at each other as a joke he remains\n unfazed. On another day, during a normal night, that would be a \nvictory. Tonight it isn&rsquo;t. Tonight Dan finds himself wishing someone \nwould try something so he could get a physical outlet for his \nfrustrations.</p><p>Dan does make tea once he&rsquo;s home, but skips the \nsandwich. It isn&rsquo;t until he sits down on his desk chair, warm cup in \nhand, that he realises he forgot to change into his pyjamas. Exhaustion \nreplaces everything else in that moment. Dan puts his tea down on the \ndesk and gets up from the chair. He pulls down the blinds on his \nmeaningless window and strips down to his underwear. Without brushing \nhis teeth he gets under the covers in his neatly made bed and closes his\n eyes for sleep.</p></p>",
