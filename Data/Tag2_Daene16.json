He frowned hoping to talk to her, he got up and got ready heading to the dining hall where he saw Essa helping Doran.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Oberyn.&rdquo; Doran said nearly making Essa drop the tray in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Doran, Essa. What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Oberyn asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa always comes and eats breakfast with me while making sure I don&rsquo;t need anything. Essa do tell him what you found?&rdquo; Doran said.</p><p>&ldquo;A friend of mine found some old Valyrian medicine that could have Doran walking again within a week or so.&rdquo; Essa said mixing the medicine for Doran.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing to hear, thank you Essa.&rdquo; Oberyn said smiling at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Doran if you don&rsquo;t need anything else, I promised the girls I would help them with their hair for tonight.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Thank you again really.&rdquo; Doran said hugging Essa.</p><p>&ldquo;Oberyn when you get a chance I need to discuss something with you about Nymeria.&rdquo; Essa said as she removed her self from Doran&rsquo;s embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;And what would that be?&rdquo; Oberyn asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Nymeria would like to come with us to Dragonstone.&rdquo; Essa said preparing for Oberyn&rsquo;s reaction. </p><p>&ldquo;Did she mention why?&rdquo; Oberyn asked confused at why his second eldest daughter would want to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;She feels like she doesn&rsquo;t fit here and she mentioned that she is very unhappy here.&rdquo; Essa said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me speak to her before I make any decisions.&rdquo; Oberyn said as Essa nodded as she left the room.</p><p>Essa walked to Daenerys room where Missandei, Dany, Daario, and five of Oberyn&rsquo;s eight daughters sat.</p><p>&ldquo;Daario you going to get your hair braided as well?&rdquo; Essa asked with an amused laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Sadly no but I am just a little bit curious as to what you will be wearing tonight though.&rdquo; Daario said smiling down at Essa.</p><p>Essa rolled her eyes at him as she sat down on one of the benches before Elia came crawling into her lap. Essa adjusted her and began braiding her hair impressing Missandei at how fast she could braid and how good it looked.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa where did you learn to braid like that?&rdquo; Missandei asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know really. I have always been really good at it, I just used to wear my hair in braids most of the time.&rdquo; Essa asked shrugging her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;My husband Drogo used to joke that she was part Dothraki because of how well she could braid and her fighting skills.&rdquo; Daenerys said with a smile as she finished Obara&rsquo;s hair who turned and hugged her.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa, did you ever fight the Dothraki?&rdquo; Obelle asked as Missandei began to work on her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Multiple times actually.&rdquo; Essa said with a smile at one of the memories of fighting some members of Khal Drogos tribe.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; Nymeria asked turning her head to look at Essa with a smile on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Qhono, The leader of the Dothraki. Essa came fought nearly half of the tribe to rescue Daenerys who they had captured.&rdquo; Daario said with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;And earning my respect as well.&rdquo; Qhono said stepping into the room holding a letter.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Essa, a raven came for you. The prince asked me to give me to you.&rdquo; Qhono said handing Essa a scroll.</p><p>&ldquo;Qhono you can stay. This is important I need to discuss with everyone. We can fill Jorah in at the feast tonight.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa, what is it?&rdquo; Daenerys asked.</p><p>&ldquo;The whereabouts of Ser Gregor Clegane. I want to give him to the Martells as a gift for their hospitality towards us and to further secure our alliance with them.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to go after the Mountain? Essa that&rsquo;s a death wish even for you.&rdquo; Daario said.</p><p>&ldquo;Whose the Mountain?&rdquo; Oberyn&rsquo;s daughters asked in unison.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man responsible for what happened to your aunt and your two cousins. Now, girls, you have to promise me you won&rsquo;t speak of this to your father or uncle until I say you can.&rdquo; Essa asked sticking her pinky out feeling the other three wrap theirs around hers.</p><p>&ldquo;As for your comment Daario, I am not that stupid. I have someone going to fetch him and bring him to Dorne.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>After finishing discussing the plan Daario and Qhono left leaving the girls to finish getting ready. While helping Daenerys get her dress on, there was a knock on the door followed by Missandei returning with a dress and pair of heels.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Essa, this is for you to wear tonight.&rdquo; Missandei said with a smile.</p><p>Missandei laid it on the bed and that&rsquo;s when Essa got a full view of it. It was a black sleeveless dress with a gold snake at the back connected with gold chains. Essa smiled having a feeling she knew who this from.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems like someone is trying to stake their claim on you.&rdquo; Daenerys said with a small smile on her face.</p><p>Essa rolled her eyes at Daenerys comment before changing into the dress. Essa looked in the mirror hardly recognizing herself in the dress. It had been so long since she had been in anything but amour.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit.&rdquo; Daenerys said beginning to braid and style Essa&rsquo;s hair as Missandei helped Essa put her heels on.</p><p>&ldquo;Before we go, both of you strap these to your tighs.&rdquo; Essa says handing them both a dragger.</p><p>Qhono and Ser Jorah came and escorted the girls to the dining hall but not before taking notice of how beautiful Essa looked. They made it to the dining hall and Essa who walked into the room immediately caught the attention of both Daario and Oberyn. Essa&rsquo;s eyes weren&rsquo;t concerned about Daario they were more concerned about finding a certain prince. Her eyes finally found him and they both sent one another a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo; Elia said looking up at her father.</p><p>&ldquo;Like a princess-worthy to be our new mother.&rdquo; Nymeria and Obara said smiling at their father.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that so? Is that the reason you want to go to Dragonstone with her so much Nym?&rdquo; Oberyn asked his second eldest daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s more a mother figure to me than Ellaria has ever been.&rdquo; Nymeria admitted as she watched Essa laugh with Daenerys about something.</p><p>Oberyn smiled at Nymeria and could see how badly she wanted to be Essa and knew he had to let his daughter go in order for her to be happy but he wouldn&rsquo;t let her know his decision quite yet.</p><p>&ldquo;House Martell and all of Dorne pledge our alliengence to House Targaryen and It&rsquo;s two queens.&rdquo; Doran said smiling at Daenerys and Essa before raising his glass as everyone followed his actions.</p><p>A little later Essa grabbed a bottle of wine and snuck her way out of the party and headed out to one of the water gardens wanting a few minutes alone to let everything sink in.

What\u2019s going on here?\u201d Oberyn asked.</p><p>\u201cEssa always comes and eats breakfast with me while making sure I don\u2019t need anything.

We can fill Jorah in at the feast tonight.\u201d Essa said.</p><p>\u201cEssa, what is it?\u201d Daenerys asked.</p><p>\u201cThe whereabouts of Ser Gregor Clegane. I want to give him to the Martells as a gift for their hospitality towards us and to further secure our alliance with them.\u201d Essa said.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go after the Mountain? Essa that\u2019s a death wish even for you.\u201d Daario said.</p><p>\u201cWhose the Mountain?\u201d Oberyn\u2019s daughters asked in unison.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the man responsible for what happened to your aunt and your two cousins. Now, girls, you have to promise me you won\u2019t speak of this to your father or uncle until I say you can.\u201d Essa asked sticking her pinky out feeling the other three wrap theirs around hers.</p><p>\u201cAs for your comment Daario, I am not that stupid. I have someone going to fetch him and bring him to Dorne.\u201d Essa said.</p><p>After finishing discussing the plan Daario and Qhono left leaving the girls to finish getting ready. While helping Daenerys get her dress on, there was a knock on the door followed by Missandei returning with a dress and pair of heels.</p><p>\u201cLady Essa, this is for you to wear tonight.\u201d Missandei said with a smile.</p><p>Missandei laid it on the bed and that\u2019s when Essa got a full view of it.

They made it to the dining hall and Essa who walked into the room immediately caught the attention of both Daario and Oberyn. Essa\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t concerned about Daario they were more concerned about finding a certain prince. Her eyes finally found him and they both sent one another a small smile.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d Elia said looking up at her father.</p><p>\u201cLike a princess-worthy to be our new mother.\u201d Nymeria and Obara said smiling at their father.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?

She\u2019s more a mother figure to me than Ellaria has ever been.\u201d Nymeria admitted as she watched Essa laugh with Daenerys about something.</p><p>Oberyn smiled at Nymeria and could see how badly she wanted to be Essa and knew he had to let his daughter go in order for her to be happy but he wouldn\u2019t let her know his decision quite yet.</p><p>\u201cHouse Martell and all of Dorne pledge our alliengence to House Targaryen and It\u2019s two queens.\u201d Doran said smiling at Daenerys and Essa before raising his glass as everyone followed his actions.</p><p>A little later Essa grabbed a bottle of wine and snuck her way out of the party and headed out to one of the water gardens wanting a few minutes alone to let everything sink in. She untied her shoes offsetting them next to her before dipping her feet in the water.</p><p>\u201cYou look breathtaking in that dress.\u201d A voice said making Essa grab her dagger before she saw Oberyn walking over to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.

But there\u2019s something I want to ask you, my love.\u201d Oberyn said leaning closer to Essa.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be? You want to know if what you have heard from your girls is true?\u201d Essa asked knowing that his four girls have worked tirelessly to get her and Oberyn together.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Oberyn asked confused.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have heard the same things from them and Doran and let\u2019s just say I want to know if it\u2019s true or not.\u201d Essa said.</p><p>\u201cIt is true my love. All of it. From the way you are with all eight of my girls, your fearlessness, your strength, your kindness, your wisdom, your wit, but most of all your beauty.\u201d Oberyn said.</p><p>Essa grabbed Oberyn\u2019s face pulling him down to her before attaching her lips to his. Oberyn smiled kissing her back feeling that electricity flow through him something he hasn\u2019t felt in a long time.

He smiled when he saw walking toward the bed. He closed his book as Essa crawled into the bed with him.</p><p>\u201cNot even gonna try to sleep on your own tonight?\u201d Oberyn asked with an amused smile.</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019m trying something new out.\u201d Essa said laying her head on Oberyn\u2019s chest who smiled down at her.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight my love.\u201d Oberyn said pressing a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight my sun.\u201d Essa said pressing a kiss to lips before laying her head back down on his chest.</p></p>",

He frowned hoping to talk to her, he got up and got ready heading to the dining hall where he saw Essa helping Doran.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Oberyn.&rdquo; Doran said nearly making Essa drop the tray in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning Doran, Essa. What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Oberyn asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa always comes and eats breakfast with me while making sure I don&rsquo;t need anything. Essa do tell him what you found?&rdquo; Doran said.</p><p>&ldquo;A friend of mine found some old Valyrian medicine that could have Doran walking again within a week or so.&rdquo; Essa said mixing the medicine for Doran.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing to hear, thank you Essa.&rdquo; Oberyn said smiling at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Doran if you don&rsquo;t need anything else, I promised the girls I would help them with their hair for tonight.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Thank you again really.&rdquo; Doran said hugging Essa.</p><p>&ldquo;Oberyn when you get a chance I need to discuss something with you about Nymeria.&rdquo; Essa said as she removed her self from Doran&rsquo;s embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;And what would that be?&rdquo; Oberyn asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Nymeria would like to come with us to Dragonstone.&rdquo; Essa said preparing for Oberyn&rsquo;s reaction. </p><p>&ldquo;Did she mention why?&rdquo; Oberyn asked confused at why his second eldest daughter would want to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;She feels like she doesn&rsquo;t fit here and she mentioned that she is very unhappy here.&rdquo; Essa said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me speak to her before I make any decisions.&rdquo; Oberyn said as Essa nodded as she left the room.</p><p>Essa walked to Daenerys room where Missandei, Dany, Daario, and five of Oberyn&rsquo;s eight daughters sat.</p><p>&ldquo;Daario you going to get your hair braided as well?&rdquo; Essa asked with an amused laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Sadly no but I am just a little bit curious as to what you will be wearing tonight though.&rdquo; Daario said smiling down at Essa.</p><p>Essa rolled her eyes at him as she sat down on one of the benches before Elia came crawling into her lap. Essa adjusted her and began braiding her hair impressing Missandei at how fast she could braid and how good it looked.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa where did you learn to braid like that?&rdquo; Missandei asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know really. I have always been really good at it, I just used to wear my hair in braids most of the time.&rdquo; Essa asked shrugging her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;My husband Drogo used to joke that she was part Dothraki because of how well she could braid and her fighting skills.&rdquo; Daenerys said with a smile as she finished Obara&rsquo;s hair who turned and hugged her.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa, did you ever fight the Dothraki?&rdquo; Obelle asked as Missandei began to work on her hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Multiple times actually.&rdquo; Essa said with a smile at one of the memories of fighting some members of Khal Drogos tribe.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo; Nymeria asked turning her head to look at Essa with a smile on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Qhono, The leader of the Dothraki. Essa came fought nearly half of the tribe to rescue Daenerys who they had captured.&rdquo; Daario said with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;And earning my respect as well.&rdquo; Qhono said stepping into the room holding a letter.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Essa, a raven came for you. The prince asked me to give me to you.&rdquo; Qhono said handing Essa a scroll.</p><p>&ldquo;Qhono you can stay. This is important I need to discuss with everyone. We can fill Jorah in at the feast tonight.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;Essa, what is it?&rdquo; Daenerys asked.</p><p>&ldquo;The whereabouts of Ser Gregor Clegane. I want to give him to the Martells as a gift for their hospitality towards us and to further secure our alliance with them.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;You want to go after the Mountain? Essa that&rsquo;s a death wish even for you.&rdquo; Daario said.</p><p>&ldquo;Whose the Mountain?&rdquo; Oberyn&rsquo;s daughters asked in unison.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man responsible for what happened to your aunt and your two cousins. Now, girls, you have to promise me you won&rsquo;t speak of this to your father or uncle until I say you can.&rdquo; Essa asked sticking her pinky out feeling the other three wrap theirs around hers.</p><p>&ldquo;As for your comment Daario, I am not that stupid. I have someone going to fetch him and bring him to Dorne.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>After finishing discussing the plan Daario and Qhono left leaving the girls to finish getting ready. While helping Daenerys get her dress on, there was a knock on the door followed by Missandei returning with a dress and pair of heels.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Essa, this is for you to wear tonight.&rdquo; Missandei said with a smile.</p><p>Missandei laid it on the bed and that&rsquo;s when Essa got a full view of it. It was a black sleeveless dress with a gold snake at the back connected with gold chains. Essa smiled having a feeling she knew who this from.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems like someone is trying to stake their claim on you.&rdquo; Daenerys said with a small smile on her face.</p><p>Essa rolled her eyes at Daenerys comment before changing into the dress. Essa looked in the mirror hardly recognizing herself in the dress. It had been so long since she had been in anything but amour.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit.&rdquo; Daenerys said beginning to braid and style Essa&rsquo;s hair as Missandei helped Essa put her heels on.</p><p>&ldquo;Before we go, both of you strap these to your tighs.&rdquo; Essa says handing them both a dragger.</p><p>Qhono and Ser Jorah came and escorted the girls to the dining hall but not before taking notice of how beautiful Essa looked. They made it to the dining hall and Essa who walked into the room immediately caught the attention of both Daario and Oberyn. Essa&rsquo;s eyes weren&rsquo;t concerned about Daario they were more concerned about finding a certain prince. Her eyes finally found him and they both sent one another a small smile.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo; Elia said looking up at her father.</p><p>&ldquo;Like a princess-worthy to be our new mother.&rdquo; Nymeria and Obara said smiling at their father.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that so? Is that the reason you want to go to Dragonstone with her so much Nym?&rdquo; Oberyn asked his second eldest daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s more a mother figure to me than Ellaria has ever been.&rdquo; Nymeria admitted as she watched Essa laugh with Daenerys about something.</p><p>Oberyn smiled at Nymeria and could see how badly she wanted to be Essa and knew he had to let his daughter go in order for her to be happy but he wouldn&rsquo;t let her know his decision quite yet.</p><p>&ldquo;House Martell and all of Dorne pledge our alliengence to House Targaryen and It&rsquo;s two queens.&rdquo; Doran said smiling at Daenerys and Essa before raising his glass as everyone followed his actions.</p><p>A little later Essa grabbed a bottle of wine and snuck her way out of the party and headed out to one of the water gardens wanting a few minutes alone to let everything sink in. She untied her shoes offsetting them next to her before dipping her feet in the water.</p><p>&ldquo;You look breathtaking in that dress.&rdquo; A voice said making Essa grab her dagger before she saw Oberyn walking over to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. You don&rsquo;t look so bad yourself.&rdquo; Essa said as he sat next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;I honestly didn&rsquo;t think you would wear the dress when I sent it to your room.&rdquo; Oberyn admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;I would never disrespect you like that your highness. Plus its actually quite beautiful, thank you.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for treating my girls like they are your own more importantly Nymeria but thank you for trying to help Doran.&rdquo; Oberyn said.</p><p>&ldquo;Doran had become like an older brother to me, which I never thought I would say again. As for your girls, they are wonderful especially Nym. Did you talk to her about Dragonstone?&rdquo; Essa asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I did. She and basically my other three daughters admitted that you have treated them alot better than Ellaria ever has. I want her to go with you.&rdquo; Oberyn admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have conditions for her coming with me that we can talk about tomorrow if you want.&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;We can.

Your morality is all nature and no nurture. </p><p>That might kinda be bullshit, right?</p><p>Yeah, now imagine how some people feel about Daenerys Targaryen of Game of Thrones and her sudden descent into madness. </p>",

Plus she doesn&rsquo;t deserve to suffer for what Rhaegar did to Elia.&rdquo; Oberyn said raising his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Enough you two!&rdquo; Doran said tired of them fighting about what they were going to do about Essa.</p><p>&ldquo;I have already invited the Dragon Queen and nothing is to happen to happen to either of them.&rdquo; Doran said looking at Ellaria.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t why Essa is all the sudden an issue.&rdquo; Nymeria said.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean Nymeria?&rdquo; Doran asked his niece.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean she&rsquo;s been here for almost three months now and she hasn&rsquo;t once tried to hurt any of us well except father when she first regained consciousness but other than that, she has hardly asked for anything while she&rsquo;s &nbsp;been here, father she treats me at least a lot better than your paramour there.&rdquo; Nymeria said.</p><p>Ellaria was about to say something when Essa walked in, nearly taking Oberyn&rsquo;s breathe away at the sight of her in a bright yellow dress that contrasted with her dark skin so well. It was no secret that Oberyn wanted Essa in more ways than one but she never once gave into his offers about joining him and Ellaria or rather him alone which made him want her more.</p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace, you wanted to see me?&rdquo; Essa said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, now except Oberyn leave so I can talk with our guest.&rdquo; Doran said dismissing everyone from the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Lady Essa, I must say you look rather ravishing in a dress, you should wear them more often.&rdquo; Oberyn said smiling down at Essa.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think for a second that I couldn&rsquo;t kick your ass because I&rsquo;m wearing this.&rdquo; Essa said looking back up at him with a small smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright you two, stop flirting with each other for five minutes so we can talk about Essa and her family coming.&rdquo; Doran said even though he liked the thought of Oberyn and Essa being something more.</p><p>&ldquo;You invited them here?&rdquo; Essa asked clearly shocked and excited at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;I did. I wrote to your sister basically explaining everything and how we just found how who you really were and invited her and people here. I apologize for yesterday, I guess maybe we should&rsquo;ve waited for you to tell us your true identity.&rdquo; Doran said.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I had every intention of telling you but I didn&rsquo;t know how to do so. But thank you for inviting my sister and my people here, it means a lot to me.&rdquo; Essa said with a small smile.</p><p>Doran excused himself from the room leaving Oberyn and Essa by themselves. Essa poured herself some wine before sitting down on one of the couches.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you mad that I didn&rsquo;t tell you about who I really was?&rdquo; Essa asked Oberyn after a few minutes.</p><p>Oberyn smiled to himself at the thought of her caring what he actually thought about her. He poured some wine before sitting down next to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly no. I had some suspicions about who you really were but I had hoped that you would have told me the truth eventually.&rdquo; Oberyn said.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually I&rsquo;m surprised that you didn&rsquo;t I figure it out because Nymeria had seen the mark on my wrist one day and I told her the truth.&rdquo; Essa admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Well believe it or not my daughter has a soft spot for you and would put her life before yours as she defended you today in front of Ellaria and everyone.&rdquo; Oberyn said.</p><p>&ldquo;And I would do the same. She&rsquo;s a great kid, I think she just has a rough time competing for your attention alongside her sisters and dealing with Ellaria.&rdquo; Essa said looking at him.</p><p>Oberyn loved that idea of Essa getting along with his girls specifically Nymeria who was often the most difficult out of the eight. He grabbed her hand slowly turning it over to admire her tattoo but he also noticed how she didn&rsquo;t retract her hand from him.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you get this?&rdquo; Oberyn asked.</p><p>&ldquo;When I turned 16, it showed up on my arm and then I was put into training where I was handpicked by the Mad King to defend the throne and then after the mad king and most of the Valkyrie had been killed, Rhallea basically adopted me to help protect me and so I would be able to protect her children.&rdquo; Essa said quietly at the memory of losing her first family and then Rhallea soon after.</p><p>Oberyn&rsquo;s reached his hand up to Essa&rsquo;s face and wiped away so of her tears with his thumbs, hating to see her upset. He was glad to see Essa finally letting him see this side of her, the side that makes her human almost.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I have kept you from doing other important things.&rdquo; Essa said after a few minutes slowly pulling away from Oberyn.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing is more important than making sure our guest or as my daughters refer to as &lsquo;the princess&rsquo; is alright.&rdquo; Oberyn says keeping his hands over Essa&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hardly a princess.&rdquo; Essa says.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. In fact your a queen.&rdquo; Oberyn says looking into her eyes with a smile.</p></p>",
