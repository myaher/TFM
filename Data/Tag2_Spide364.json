Why would you do that?\u201d You screamed at Peter as you held him close attempting to put pressure on his fresh wound.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let him get to you\u201d He mumbled shifting his position in the rubble.</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve handled myself\u201d You yelled more in fear than actual anger.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t blame Peter all that much. If you saw Thanos and his alien goons heading towards him you would\u2019ve sprung into action too. Normally you\u2019d be over analyzing the situation wondering if Peter coming to your aide meant he liked you. This time you were far too concerned to even have the slightest thought of your schoolgirl crush on your mind.</p><p>One of the aliens had plunged his ugly claws right into Peter\u2019s chest. Blood was pouring out of the wound and Peter\u2019s breath was ragged and forced. You had to do something quickly; he had lost a lot of blood. </p><p>\u201cPeter you have to stand for me. I can\u2019t carry you\u201d You said brushing a stray hair out of his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can\u201d He mumbled.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u201d You begged him but stopped as another alien came charging your way. You quickly grabbed a broken piece of concrete and threw it at the creature with a grunt sending him crumbling to the ground. \u201cYou have to try. For me\u201d You said turning back to Peter with tears threatening to spill from your eyes at any minute. </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes fluttered open weakly at your last statement. \u201cI\u2019ll try\u201d</p><p>With that the webslinger did the best he could to push himself off the pavement with a moan as you wrapped his arm around your shoulder and your arm around his waist to steady him. He stumbled along as you tried to guide him as carefully as possible towards the rest of you team who was very much preoccupied. </p><p>\u201cStrange\u201d You called to the sorcerer. \u201cPeter is hurt I need to get him back to Bruce\u201d You yelled through the smoke. Peter had crumpled at your feet and was now vomiting. The Doctor turned his head slightly and with a wave of his hand you were back at the Avengers Base. </p><p>Peter had now completely collapsed on the floor and was non-responsive. \u201cBruce\u201d Your scream echoing through the empty halls of the base. \u201cCome on Peter stay with me\u201d You whispered gently caressing his cheek with your thumb.</p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Bruce called entering the lobby with a concerned look in his eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter got stabbed by one of the aliens. He\u2019s lost a lot of blood\u201d You said watching as Bruce knelt down and started taking Peter\u2019s pulse. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still breathing but he doesn\u2019t have long\u201d Bruce said scooping Peter up in his arms and carrying him to med bay.</p><p>You followed closely behind finally taking in what kind of state you were in. Peter\u2019s blood was soaked all over your suit and had ended up smeared on your hands, face, and arms. In all honesty you were a mess.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Bruce to hook Peter up to all sorts of medical equipment. He stitched the wound the best he could and checked Peter\u2019s vitals again with a frown. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You asked realizing something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI was able to stop the bleeding and stabilize the wound but he\u2019s lost too much blood and his body can\u2019t produce it fast enough\u201d He said with a sigh. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky he\u2019s still alive as is, any normal person and he\u2019d already be dead\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell can\u2019t we just give him some blood?\u201d You said thinking of blood donors.</p><p>\u201cPeter\u2019s blood is radioactive if we mix normal blood with his I don\u2019t think his body would accept it\u201d Bruce said rubbing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan we use yours?\u201d You ask innocently.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Bruce asks in disbelief. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m mixing radioactivity with gamma radiation\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen what do you propose?\u201d You said frustrated that there seemed to be no solution. Bruce was silent for a moment. \u201cWait can you make radioactive blood?\u201d</p><p>Bruce looked up for a minute. \u201cThat might work. But I\u2019d need tons of blood since the radioactive charge would diminish some of it during bonding. I don\u2019t think Peter has enough time to wait for me to get my hands on it\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse mine\u201d You said instantly.</p><p>\u201cY/n no\u201d Bruce said shaking his head. \u201cUh uh. It\u2019s too dangerous. There\u2019s no telling how much blood I\u2019d actually need\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease Bruce\u201d You begged. \u201cHe\u2019s running out of options and I want to save him. Please\u201d</p><p>Bruce sighed. \u201cShit. Alright fine. Hop in that bed and roll up your sleeve. But if you get too low I\u2019m pulling you out\u201d You nodded and did as you were told. Within minutes you were hooked up to a machine that pumped blood directly from your arm into a radioactive chamber and then directly into Peter. \u201cIf you start to feel sick you need to tell me. Do you understand?\u201d He asked to which you nodded. Knowing full well no matter what you were going to save Peter.</p><p>You felt fine for about five minutes and shortly there after you felt weak and dizzy. You could hear Peter making quiet noises which was the only thing keeping you going. \u201cHow are we doing?\u201d You asked Bruce as strong as you could.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually doing really well\u201d Bruce nodded checking his vitals. \u201cI actually think we\u2019re almost done\u201d You smiled to yourself hoping you could hold on that long. A few more minutes passed and it took everything in you to keep from passing out. \u201cAll done\u201d Bruce said pulling the needle from your arm. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d You started to speak but only garble came out as you slipped into unconsciousness. \u201cDamn it Y/n\u201d Was the last thing you heard.</p><p>When Peter finally woke he blinked his eyes a few times before pushing himself in an upright position. His hand went to his chest and felt the bulge and the sharp pain of the wound. He cringed as he turned himself to the side to get off the bed. What he say next to him made him sick to his stomach. You were lying in a bed soaked in blood all over and you were pale as a ghost. \u201cOh god\u201d He mumbled to himself rushing over to you. \u201cY/n\u201d He said caressing your face softly. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks\u201d You croaked with a smile. \u201cThe blood is actually yours\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d He asked somewhat shocked. \u201cWhy are you so pale though?\u201d He asked not understanding.</p><p>\u201cBecause my blood is in you\u201d You said gesturing to the machine between your two beds. \u201cYou had lost so much that Bruce needed to find a way to give you more, naturally it had to be radioactive\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupid\u201d He said sitting down on your bed with a huff of irritation. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Here goes nothing you thought to yourself. \u201cMaybe because I really care about you as more than just a friend\u201d</p><p>Peter was shocked at first but quickly leaned over and pressed his lips on yours softly. \u201cI love you too, but don\u2019t you ever do something like this again\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me\u201d You teased.</p>",

Bruce was silent for a moment. \u201cWait can you make radioactive blood?\u201d</p><p>Bruce looked up for a minute. \u201cThat might work. But I\u2019d need tons of blood since the radioactive charge would diminish some of it during bonding. I don\u2019t think Peter has enough time to wait for me to get my hands on it\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse mine\u201d You said instantly.</p><p>\u201cY/n no\u201d Bruce said shaking his head. \u201cUh uh. It\u2019s too dangerous. There\u2019s no telling how much blood I\u2019d actually need\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease Bruce\u201d You begged. \u201cHe\u2019s running out of options and I want to save him. Please\u201d</p><p>Bruce sighed. \u201cShit. Alright fine. Hop in that bed and roll up your sleeve. But if you get too low I\u2019m pulling you out\u201d You nodded and did as you were told. Within minutes you were hooked up to a machine that pumped blood directly from your arm into a radioactive chamber and then directly into Peter. \u201cIf you start to feel sick you need to tell me. Do you understand?\u201d He asked to which you nodded. Knowing full well no matter what you were going to save Peter.</p><p>You felt fine for about five minutes and shortly there after you felt weak and dizzy.

A few more minutes passed and it took everything in you to keep from passing out. \u201cAll done\u201d Bruce said pulling the needle from your arm. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d You started to speak but only garble came out as you slipped into unconsciousness. \u201cDamn it Y/n\u201d Was the last thing you heard.</p><p>When Peter finally woke he blinked his eyes a few times before pushing himself in an upright position. His hand went to his chest and felt the bulge and the sharp pain of the wound. He cringed as he turned himself to the side to get off the bed. What he say next to him made him sick to his stomach. You were lying in a bed soaked in blood all over and you were pale as a ghost. \u201cOh god\u201d He mumbled to himself rushing over to you. \u201cY/n\u201d He said caressing your face softly. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks\u201d You croaked with a smile. \u201cThe blood is actually yours\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d He asked somewhat shocked. \u201cWhy are you so pale though?\u201d He asked not understanding.</p><p>\u201cBecause my blood is in you\u201d You said gesturing to the machine between your two beds. \u201cYou had lost so much that Bruce needed to find a way to give you more, naturally it had to be radioactive\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupid\u201d He said sitting down on your bed with a huff of irritation. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Here goes nothing you thought to yourself. \u201cMaybe because I really care about you as more than just a friend\u201d</p><p>Peter was shocked at first but quickly leaned over and pressed his lips on yours softly. \u201cI love you too, but don\u2019t you ever do something like this again\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me\u201d You teased.</p></p>",

You were lying in a bed soaked in blood all over and you were pale as a ghost. &ldquo;Oh god&rdquo; He mumbled to himself rushing over to you. &ldquo;Y/n&rdquo; He said caressing your face softly. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as bad as it looks&rdquo; You croaked with a smile. &ldquo;The blood is actually yours&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine?&rdquo; He asked somewhat shocked. &ldquo;Why are you so pale though?&rdquo; He asked not understanding.</p><p>&ldquo;Because my blood is in you&rdquo; You said gesturing to the machine between your two beds. &ldquo;You had lost so much that Bruce needed to find a way to give you more, naturally it had to be radioactive&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so stupid&rdquo; He said sitting down on your bed with a huff of irritation. &ldquo;Why would you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Here goes nothing you thought to yourself. &ldquo;Maybe because I really care about you as more than just a friend&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was shocked at first but quickly leaned over and pressed his lips on yours softly. &ldquo;I love you too, but don&rsquo;t you ever do something like this again&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try and stop me&rdquo; You teased.</p></p>",

Peter got off the elevator and almost walked into Clint who was standing in the middle of the common room.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry kid didn&rsquo;t mean to be in the way&rdquo; Clint said with a grin helping peter to his feet</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright Clint I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention I didn&rsquo;t even know you were in town&rdquo; Peter said noticing Clint had his uniform on.</p><p>&ldquo;I just got in town earlier today kid I&rsquo;ll be hanging for a bit&rdquo; Clint said smiling</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool is there a mission do I need my suit I can grab it quick it&rsquo;s in my room&rdquo; peter said excitedly</p><p>&ldquo;Kid I&rsquo;m not the one who can give you the clearance for that that&rsquo;s your dad, plus I don&rsquo;t think everyone is needed&rdquo; Clint said smirking grabbing his arrows. </p><p>Peter grin dropped as Tony, Steve, and Natasha walked in the room all suited up. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kiddo is Legolas playing nice?&rdquo; tony quipped</p><p>&ldquo;Hey I take offence to that stark I would never harm your kid&rdquo; Clint said sticking out his tongue</p><p>&ldquo;Just playing with you Barton&rdquo; tony said laughing</p><p>Peter got up looked tony in the face &ldquo;Tony can I please go too you said I&rsquo;m avenger and so far I&rsquo;ve barely been on any missions&rdquo; peter pleaded </p><p>&ldquo;Pete so far we haven&rsquo;t needed you yet&rdquo; tony said sighing &ldquo;for example today it&rsquo;s just me, birdbrain, capsicle, and Natalie, it&rsquo;s a minor mission&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a minor mission why can&rsquo;t I go I&rsquo;ve probably handled worse on the streets of Queens&rdquo; peter asked crossing his arms</p><p>&ldquo;Just looking out for you kid were going out of state and I don&rsquo;t know how long the mission will last I think probably on till tomorrow but I don&rsquo;t know something could surprise us it last longer, I rather not have May castrate me&rdquo; tony said looking away.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr., Stark I&rsquo;m calling Bullshit say what the real reason is already? You don&rsquo;t trust me to be on the missions do you?&rdquo; peter said raising his voice</p><p>Tony could tell peter was annoyed with him it was the first time he called him Mr., stark in months.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete of course I trust you&rdquo; tony said simply</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me. You never let me help even though I&rsquo;m stronger than you. You treat me like a child even now. Even though I&rsquo;m 17 and have died&rdquo; </p><p>That complete stopped tony in his tracks, the others didn&rsquo;t even attempt moving or talking, they just stared in silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid I trust my life in your hands ok. It pains me to bench you because of your potential but for my sanity I have to at least sometimes, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; tony said weakly.</p><p>&ldquo;I need more of a reason then that tony&rdquo; peter said shorty</p><p>&ldquo;Kid after I got you back after you went back to being a friendly neighborhood Spiderman literally every time you got even the smallest injury I nearly had a heart attack.

It wasn&rsquo;t a big thing, wasn&rsquo;t something he saw often- after all, Tony was very kind with him, but&hellip; he often was treated like a kid in a sense, never really seen as someone who could handle himself in a fight. And he could! He really really could! But Tony&hellip; Tony didn&rsquo;t see that in him. He just saw a kid. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a fun thing to realize, knowing your idol thought you just someone to protect, but Peter wanted to prove to him who he was, what he was, how good he could be. It would be tough, he thought, having to do something like that, while also knowing that he would never be as good as Tony probably would want from him. Still, he had to prove it. </p><p>He got his chance when his school was attacked. Albeit, it wasn&rsquo;t a good thing, but it worked with what he wanted from this world. It was sucky, but Peter told himself to run when they were attacked, making himself out to be a coward, and hid in the bathroom, change, and left his bag there. Ned would get it, he was sure enough of that. </p><p>Whatever this thing was, in was nearly fifteen times Peter&rsquo;s size. It looked like it was made of some sort of oozy substance and didn&rsquo;t seem to be sentient. Which meant there was something bigger at play here, but Peter could ignore that for the time being so that he could focus on defeating this one. </p><p>He swung out the window, rolling and landing a few feet from the monster. He saw students being lead out the back, the thing out front, and Peter moved back to the students fist, swinging by teachers quickly, asking, in a slightly deeper voice than he own was, if there were any students they knew were missing. </p><p>Fucking Flash. Flash was missing, he was the link, he was still inside, dammit. The one person he might want to leave behind in this type of thing was the one who was stuck. With that, he raced into the building, ducking through various rooms, eyes darting around behind the mask. Damn him. </p><p>Flash was stuck on the second story in a closet of one of the rooms. Luckily the thing hadn&rsquo;t managed to get to him quite yet, which left Peter to have to fling him over his shoulder-Flash was always was difficult even when it was going to save his life-and run with him, swinging quickly and skidding out back with him, tossing him to the ground, maybe a little more&hellip; rough than he had to be with him. </p><p>Still, he couldn&rsquo;t have been prepared for Flash to hang on to his mask, nor the suddenness of the monster grabbing him suddenly and yanking him back. His head was suddenly free of his mask, but he couldn&rsquo;t focus on that, couldn&rsquo;t focus on the gasps of the students below him. </p><p>Instead, he squirmed in the thing&rsquo;s grasp, trying to fight off it&rsquo;s grip. He shifted, managing to get a hand free, and shot webs at what looked like it&rsquo;s face. The thing stumbled back, dropping Peter, who didn&rsquo;t have time to swing himself out of the way and into safety, smacking face first into the ground. He scrambled up quickly, slinging himself to the roof and firing at the creature again, shivering a bit, covering it&rsquo;s eye with webs. </p><p>The thing pawed at it self, and Peter took his chance, slinging himself onto the creature and wrapping himself around it quickly, feet kicking a bit in order to get himself around the thing over and over and over again. </p><p>The thing fell as Peter caught it&rsquo;s legs, and he slung out of the way, rolling to a wheezing stop next to Flash, who clutched the mask in his hands and stared with wide eyes. There was a thud, and he watched the creature fall, before he struggled to his feet, spat blood onto the floor and snatched his mask back from Flash. Flash blinked, tried to grab it back, for whatever reason, but Peter had it on now. He looked around a moment, seeing Tony coming in for a landing quickly. News was just getting there, and&hellip; luckily, it looked as if no one had caught him with his mask off. He turned, addressing the group of teachers and students. </p><p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; yeah, you, you never saw who I was. Could, y'know, use you guys as leverage, and, uhm&hellip; they don&rsquo;t mind killing people, so yeah&hellip; don&rsquo;t tell anyone who you saw under this mask.&rdquo; With that, he slung into the school, rolled into the bathroom, changing back into his normal clothes quickly. </p><p>He slung his bag over his shoulder, ducked out the back and joined Ned standing on the side, staring at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Dude.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know. It sucks. Flash knows, he&rsquo;s never gonna leave me alone about it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You told us we might die if we say anything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Which could be true for all I know, Ned, it&rsquo;s not exactly&hellip; a good thing.&rdquo; </p><p>News cameras where everywhere now, Iron Man Suits lifting the creature and flying off with it. It wasn&rsquo;t a good idea, but Peter huffed and left quickly. He didn&rsquo;t want to see this. Even if there were webs all over that thing, Tony would get the credit for his take down. He didn&rsquo;t want to deal with this at the moment. </p><p>He just wanted to take a nap, is all. It would be fine once he did that. He huffed, starting how, sighing softly. He was just&hellip; tired. </p><p>Tired of being a hero, if he were being truly honest. </p><p>Tired of&hellip; basically everything. </p><p>He sighed, looking up at the sky a moment. Cloudless, sun shining. Nothing there going by at all. He huffed, shaking his head. They didn&rsquo;t need him at all. He shook the thought from his head, and thus, continued right on home. </p>",

It wasn\u2019t a big thing, wasn\u2019t something he saw often- after all, Tony was very kind with him, but\u2026 he often was treated like a kid in a sense, never really seen as someone who could handle himself in a fight. And he could! He really really could! But Tony\u2026 Tony didn\u2019t see that in him. He just saw a kid. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t a fun thing to realize, knowing your idol thought you just someone to protect, but Peter wanted to prove to him who he was, what he was, how good he could be. It would be tough, he thought, having to do something like that, while also knowing that he would never be as good as Tony probably would want from him. Still, he had to prove it. </p><p>He got his chance when his school was attacked. Albeit, it wasn\u2019t a good thing, but it worked with what he wanted from this world. It was sucky, but Peter told himself to run when they were attacked, making himself out to be a coward, and hid in the bathroom, change, and left his bag there. Ned would get it, he was sure enough of that. </p><p>Whatever this thing was, in was nearly fifteen times Peter\u2019s size. It looked like it was made of some sort of oozy substance and didn\u2019t seem to be sentient. Which meant there was something bigger at play here, but Peter could ignore that for the time being so that he could focus on defeating this one. </p><p>He swung out the window, rolling and landing a few feet from the monster. He saw students being lead out the back, the thing out front, and Peter moved back to the students fist, swinging by teachers quickly, asking, in a slightly deeper voice than he own was, if there were any students they knew were missing. </p><p>Fucking Flash. Flash was missing, he was the link, he was still inside, dammit. The one person he might want to leave behind in this type of thing was the one who was stuck. With that, he raced into the building, ducking through various rooms, eyes darting around behind the mask. Damn him. </p><p>Flash was stuck on the second story in a closet of one of the rooms. Luckily the thing hadn\u2019t managed to get to him quite yet, which left Peter to have to fling him over his shoulder-Flash was always was difficult even when it was going to save his life-and run with him, swinging quickly and skidding out back with him, tossing him to the ground, maybe a little more\u2026 rough than he had to be with him. </p><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t have been prepared for Flash to hang on to his mask, nor the suddenness of the monster grabbing him suddenly and yanking him back. His head was suddenly free of his mask, but he couldn\u2019t focus on that, couldn\u2019t focus on the gasps of the students below him. </p><p>Instead, he squirmed in the thing\u2019s grasp, trying to fight off it\u2019s grip. He shifted, managing to get a hand free, and shot webs at what looked like it\u2019s face. The thing stumbled back, dropping Peter, who didn\u2019t have time to swing himself out of the way and into safety, smacking face first into the ground. He scrambled up quickly, slinging himself to the roof and firing at the creature again, shivering a bit, covering it\u2019s eye with webs. </p><p>The thing pawed at it self, and Peter took his chance, slinging himself onto the creature and wrapping himself around it quickly, feet kicking a bit in order to get himself around the thing over and over and over again. </p><p>The thing fell as Peter caught it\u2019s legs, and he slung out of the way, rolling to a wheezing stop next to Flash, who clutched the mask in his hands and stared with wide eyes. There was a thud, and he watched the creature fall, before he struggled to his feet, spat blood onto the floor and snatched his mask back from Flash. Flash blinked, tried to grab it back, for whatever reason, but Peter had it on now. He looked around a moment, seeing Tony coming in for a landing quickly. News was just getting there, and\u2026 luckily, it looked as if no one had caught him with his mask off. He turned, addressing the group of teachers and students. </p><p>\u201cUhm\u2026 yeah, you, you never saw who I was. Could, y'know, use you guys as leverage, and, uhm\u2026 they don\u2019t mind killing people, so yeah\u2026 don\u2019t tell anyone who you saw under this mask.\u201d With that, he slung into the school, rolled into the bathroom, changing back into his normal clothes quickly. </p><p>He slung his bag over his shoulder, ducked out the back and joined Ned standing on the side, staring at him. </p><p>\u201cDude.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. It sucks. Flash knows, he\u2019s never gonna leave me alone about it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou told us we might die if we say anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhich could be true for all I know, Ned, it\u2019s not exactly\u2026 a good thing.\u201d </p><p>News cameras where everywhere now, Iron Man Suits lifting the creature and flying off with it. It wasn\u2019t a good idea, but Peter huffed and left quickly. He didn\u2019t want to see this. Even if there were webs all over that thing, Tony would get the credit for his take down. He didn\u2019t want to deal with this at the moment. </p><p>He just wanted to take a nap, is all. It would be fine once he did that. He huffed, starting how, sighing softly. He was just\u2026 tired. </p><p>Tired of being a hero, if he were being truly honest. </p><p>Tired of\u2026 basically everything. </p><p>He sighed, looking up at the sky a moment. Cloudless, sun shining. Nothing there going by at all. He huffed, shaking his head. They didn\u2019t need him at all. He shook the thought from his head, and thus, continued right on home. </p>",
