With a careless question.\u201d Peter grins,\nlaughing.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo shit? What did you do?\u201d Nat looks at Y/N.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe was being cocky, I put him in his place. I get the impression Howie has the\nego of a six year old.\u201d She smirks. \u201cHe made a comment about Peter. So, I\nsimply reminded him this is his second date today, and well Meg slapped him.\u201d\nShe shrugs.</p><p>\u201cShe called him on his shit, I only wish I had been there to\nsee it.\u201d Buck grins.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nat.\u201d She puts her hand out to Y/N.<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d She grins, as they shake hands.<br/></p><p>\u201cHowie looking good.\u201d James chuckles.<br/></p><p>\u201cMan she\u2019s got a swing on her.\u201d Howie rubs the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cYou know my preschoolers sit in the corner when they say\nthings that get them into trouble.\u201d Y/N smirks. \u201cDo you need to sit in the\ncorner or did you learn your lesson?\u201d She tips her head.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnyone else take that a little kinky?\u201d Howie looks around.

Her body swayed against his, her waves\nshifted as her head moved side to side. Peter laughs as Buck stands around arms\nfolded over his broad chest, his head nods slowly to the music, but his feet\nremain planted on the floor. Y/N pulls Wanda over to Nat, and the three of them\nstart to dance around Buck, who shakes his head. Hair whirls, hips swing, and\nthey jump up, Buck closes his eyes as hair splays across his chest and arms as\nthey spin around and keep moving. </p><p>Howie is between two woman, not far from where they were\nthemselves.

Heading for the restroom, a\nwoman slams into the side of you, hard and directed. You let go of Wanda\u2019s hand\nin time to keep yourself upright. Your eyes land on the woman, she\u2019s got white\nblonde hair, curled and tied up, strands falling around her face, there was\nsomething familiar about her. You had no idea who she was, but something about\nher face, made you feel like you might know her.<br/></p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d She sneers, her perfect lips curling up, before she disappears into\nthe crowd.<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Nat shouts over the music and people.</p><p>\u201cRude people.\u201d You shake your head. Nat grabs your hand\npulling you with her. When you\u2019re through the bathroom door you let out a sigh.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat happened? You were there then you weren\u2019t.\u201d Wanda asks as she checks her\nmake up in the mirror.<br/></p><p>\u201cSome woman ran into me. Called me a bitch and walked away.\u201d You shrug.</p><p>\u201cJust be glade it wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s ex.

It\u2019s a really complicated story. But basically, she bailed on Benny and\nPeter.\u201d She nods. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually seen him like this before, the way he is\nwith you.\u201d A smile plays over her mouth.<br/></p><p>\u201cI wrote out my resignation email today.\u201d You flush pink, tucking a wave behind\nyour ear.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wanda and Nat look at you with wide eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf Clint tells me Monday it\u2019s not allowed. I\u2019m going to resign my position at\nthe school.\u201d You nod.</p><p>\u201cWow, Peter is a lucky fuck.\u201d Nat grins. You couldn\u2019t help\nthe smile on your lips, Wanda links her arm with yours as the three of you\nleave the bathroom.</p><p>You stood outside, Peter\u2019s arm over your shoulders. You, Nat\nand Wanda were making plans, a baking day with the kids, or going to brunch.\nPeter shakes his head, a grin on his face.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh we could brunch, and them bake, then I mean let the kids run ramped and\nsugared up.\u201d Nat grins.<br/></p><p>\u201cI like that idea.\u201d You laugh.<br/></p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Wanda looks between the two of you.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, say one?\u201d You look at Nat.<br/></p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d Nat grins, as Buck pulls her away. She waves, you laugh as\nPeter does the same, heading for his car. Wanda disappears into Sam\u2019s car,\nbefore you could really say goodbye.</p><p>\u201cMy place or yours?\u201d Peter asks when he gets in to the car.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do this kind of thing normally.\u201d You flush at your confession.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a one night stand kind of thing, Y/N.\u201d Peter\nsmirks as he pulls into traffic. \u201cI\u2019m going to press my luck and I have a\nbackup plan in place, just in case the school disagrees.\u201d He nods.<br/></p><p>\u201cGreat minds think alike.\u201d You smirk. \u201cI have one myself too.\u201d You grin as he\nlooks

With a careless question.\u201d Peter grins,\nlaughing.<br></p><p>\u201cNo shit? What did you do?\u201d Nat looks at Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cHe was being cocky, I put him in his place. I get the impression Howie has the\nego of a six year old.\u201d She smirks. \u201cHe made a comment about Peter. So, I\nsimply reminded him this is his second date today, and well Meg slapped him.\u201d\nShe shrugs.</p><p>\u201cShe called him on his shit, I only wish I had been there to\nsee it.\u201d Buck grins.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nat.\u201d She puts her hand out to Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d She grins, as they shake hands.<br></p><p>\u201cHowie looking good.\u201d James chuckles.<br></p><p>\u201cMan she\u2019s got a swing on her.\u201d Howie rubs the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cYou know my preschoolers sit in the corner when they say\nthings that get them into trouble.\u201d Y/N smirks. \u201cDo you need to sit in the\ncorner or did you learn your lesson?\u201d She tips her head.<br></p><p>\u201cAnyone else take that a little kinky?\u201d Howie looks around. Peter sighs,\nshaking his head.<br></p><p>\u201cYour brother did, when I threatened him with the same thing for swearing in my\nclass.\u201d She shrugs. Nat lights up, stepping out of Buck\u2019s arm, she links her\narm with Y/N\u2019s pulling her towards the pizza shop.<br></p><p>\u201cPlease, tell me that story.\u201d Nat grins. Y/N laughs.<br></p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Howie looks over at him.<br></p><p>\u201cIt was the way she said it.\u201d Peter chuckles, shrugging. Buck laughs, slapping\nhim on the back as they follow.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The lights flashed, and the music vibrated through their\nbodies, the crowd jumped to the beat. Her body swayed against his, her waves\nshifted as her head moved side to side. Peter laughs as Buck stands around arms\nfolded over his broad chest, his head nods slowly to the music, but his feet\nremain planted on the floor. Y/N pulls Wanda over to Nat, and the three of them\nstart to dance around Buck, who shakes his head. Hair whirls, hips swing, and\nthey jump up, Buck closes his eyes as hair splays across his chest and arms as\nthey spin around and keep moving. </p><p>Howie is between two woman, not far from where they were\nthemselves. Peter\u2019s hand loops around Y/N\u2019s wrist before he spins her back\ntowards him. Buck shakes his head, smirking, she laughs, Nat grins, and he could\nswear Howie winked at him. Alright so maybe he wasn\u2019t subtle with his\nattraction to his son\u2019s teacher, but it wasn\u2019t going to stop him.</p><hr><p><br></p><p>Your finger was linked with Wanda\u2019s who was linked to Nat,\nthe three of you moving through the packed crowd. Heading for the restroom, a\nwoman slams into the side of you, hard and directed. You let go of Wanda\u2019s hand\nin time to keep yourself upright. Your eyes land on the woman, she\u2019s got white\nblonde hair, curled and tied up, strands falling around her face, there was\nsomething familiar about her. You had no idea who she was, but something about\nher face, made you feel like you might know her.<br></p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d She sneers, her perfect lips curling up, before she disappears into\nthe crowd.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Nat shouts over the music and people.</p><p>\u201cRude people.\u201d You shake your head. Nat grabs your hand\npulling you with her. When you\u2019re through the bathroom door you let out a sigh.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat happened? You were there then you weren\u2019t.\u201d Wanda asks as she checks her\nmake up in the mirror.<br></p><p>\u201cSome woman ran into me. Called me a bitch and walked away.\u201d You shrug.</p><p>\u201cJust be glade it wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s ex. She\u2019s a nasty piece of\nwork.\u201d Nat joins as she leaves the stall, she flips the sink water on.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Your head tips.<br></p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have just run into you, she would have made a huge scene.\u201d She\nnods as she washes her hands. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, they haven\u2019t been a thing since\nafter Ben was born.\u201d She waves her hand as she dries them.</p><p>\u201cHis ex is Benny\u2019s mom?\u201d You asks.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a really complicated story. But basically, she bailed on Benny and\nPeter.\u201d She nods. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually seen him like this before, the way he is\nwith you.\u201d A smile plays over her mouth.<br></p><p>\u201cI wrote out my resignation email today.\u201d You flush pink, tucking a wave behind\nyour ear.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wanda and Nat look at you with wide eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cIf Clint tells me Monday it\u2019s not allowed. I\u2019m going to resign my position at\nthe school.\u201d You nod.</p><p>\u201cWow, Peter is a lucky fuck.\u201d Nat grins. You couldn\u2019t help\nthe smile on your lips, Wanda links her arm with yours as the three of you\nleave the bathroom.</p><p>You stood outside, Peter\u2019s arm over your shoulders. You, Nat\nand Wanda were making plans, a baking day with the kids, or going to brunch.\nPeter shakes his head, a grin on his face.<br></p><p>\u201cOh we could brunch, and them bake, then I mean let the kids run ramped and\nsugared up.\u201d Nat grins.<br></p><p>\u201cI like that idea.\u201d You laugh.<br></p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Wanda looks between the two of you.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, say one?\u201d You look at Nat.<br></p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d Nat grins, as Buck pulls her away. She waves, you laugh as\nPeter does the same, heading for his car. Wanda disappears into Sam\u2019s car,\nbefore you could really say goodbye.</p><p>\u201cMy place or yours?\u201d Peter asks when he gets in to the car.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do this kind of thing normally.\u201d You flush at your confession.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a one night stand kind of thing, Y/N.\u201d Peter\nsmirks as he pulls into traffic. \u201cI\u2019m going to press my luck and I have a\nbackup plan in place, just in case the school disagrees.\u201d He nods.<br></p><p>\u201cGreat minds think alike.\u201d You smirk. \u201cI have one myself too.\u201d You grin as he\nlooks over, brow lifted.</p><hr><p><b>Everything Peaches 8/23/18:</b><br><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJMZIYfYDu01BG_CqBel1ew\">@mo320</a> \u00a0<br><a class=\"tumblelog\"

Your eyes land on the woman, she\u2019s got white\nblonde hair, curled and tied up, strands falling around her face, there was\nsomething familiar about her. You had no idea who she was, but something about\nher face, made you feel like you might know her.<br></p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d She sneers, her perfect lips curling up, before she disappears into\nthe crowd.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N?!\u201d Nat shouts over the music and people.</p><p>\u201cRude people.\u201d You shake your head.

You couldn\u2019t help\nthe smile on your lips, Wanda links her arm with yours as the three of you\nleave the bathroom.</p><p>You stood outside, Peter\u2019s arm over your shoulders. You, Nat\nand Wanda were making plans, a baking day with the kids, or going to brunch.\nPeter shakes his head, a grin on his face.<br></p><p>\u201cOh we could brunch, and them bake, then I mean let the kids run ramped and\nsugared up.\u201d Nat grins.<br></p><p>\u201cI like that idea.\u201d You laugh.<br></p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Wanda looks between the two of you.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, say one?\u201d You look at Nat.<br></p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d Nat grins, as Buck pulls her away.

Y/N pulls Wanda over to Nat, and the three of them\nstart to dance around Buck, who shakes his head. Hair whirls, hips swing, and\nthey jump up, Buck closes his eyes as hair splays across his chest and arms as\nthey spin around and keep moving. </p><p>Howie is between two woman, not far from where they were\nthemselves. Peter&rsquo;s hand loops around Y/N&rsquo;s wrist before he spins her back\ntowards him. Buck shakes his head, smirking, she laughs, Nat grins, and he could\nswear Howie winked at him. Alright so maybe he wasn&rsquo;t subtle with his\nattraction to his son&rsquo;s teacher, but it wasn&rsquo;t going to stop him.</p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>Your finger was linked with Wanda&rsquo;s who was linked to Nat,\nthe three of you moving through the packed crowd. Heading for the restroom, a\nwoman slams into the side of you, hard and directed. You let go of Wanda&rsquo;s hand\nin time to keep yourself upright. Your eyes land on the woman, she&rsquo;s got white\nblonde hair, curled and tied up, strands falling around her face, there was\nsomething familiar about her. You had no idea who she was, but something about\nher face, made you feel like you might know her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bitch.&rdquo; She sneers, her perfect lips curling up, before she disappears into\nthe crowd.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?!&rdquo; Nat shouts over the music and people.</p><p>&ldquo;Rude people.&rdquo; You shake your head. Nat grabs your hand\npulling you with her. When you&rsquo;re through the bathroom door you let out a sigh.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened? You were there then you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Wanda asks as she checks her\nmake up in the mirror.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Some woman ran into me. Called me a bitch and walked away.&rdquo; You shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;Just be glade it wasn&rsquo;t Peter&rsquo;s ex. She&rsquo;s a nasty piece of\nwork.&rdquo; Nat joins as she leaves the stall, she flips the sink water on.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Your head tips.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have just run into you, she would have made a huge scene.&rdquo; She\nnods as she washes her hands. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, they haven&rsquo;t been a thing since\nafter Ben was born.&rdquo; She waves her hand as she dries them.</p><p>&ldquo;His ex is Benny&rsquo;s mom?&rdquo; You asks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s a really complicated story. But basically, she bailed on Benny and\nPeter.&rdquo; She nods. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never actually seen him like this before, the way he is\nwith you.&rdquo; A smile plays over her mouth.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wrote out my resignation email today.&rdquo; You flush pink, tucking a wave behind\nyour ear.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Wanda and Nat look at you with wide eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If Clint tells me Monday it&rsquo;s not allowed. I&rsquo;m going to resign my position at\nthe school.&rdquo; You nod.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, Peter is a lucky fuck.&rdquo; Nat grins. You couldn&rsquo;t help\nthe smile on your lips, Wanda links her arm with yours as the three of you\nleave the bathroom.</p><p>You stood outside, Peter&rsquo;s arm over your shoulders. You, Nat\nand Wanda were making plans, a baking day with the kids, or going to brunch.\nPeter shakes his head, a grin on his face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh we could brunch, and them bake, then I mean let the kids run ramped and\nsugared up.&rdquo; Nat grins.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I like that idea.&rdquo; You laugh.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo; Wanda looks between the two of you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, say one?&rdquo; You look at Nat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;See you then.&rdquo; Nat grins, as Buck pulls her away. She waves, you laugh as\nPeter does the same, heading for his car. Wanda disappears into Sam&rsquo;s car,\nbefore you could really say goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;My place or yours?&rdquo; Peter asks when he gets in to the car.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do this kind of thing normally.&rdquo; You flush at your confession.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a one night stand kind of thing, Y/N.&rdquo; Peter\nsmirks as he pulls into traffic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to press my luck and I have a\nbackup plan in place, just in case the school disagrees.&rdquo; He nods.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Great minds think alike.&rdquo; You smirk. &ldquo;I have one myself too.&rdquo; You grin as he\nlooks over, brow lifted.</p><hr /><p><b>Everything Peaches 8/23/18:</b><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJMZIYfYDu01BG_CqBel1ew\">@mo320</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIQ5QuBQV9nZuFdOAC9trzQ\">@izzy&ndash;lee</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7hp9PrwhrlgcxqOFy7_Iw\">@irepeldirt</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMuNunj8Xpa7tNnCVSiiDjQ\">@alyssaj23</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTPuoRdEQ7d2cGyn1T0UHxg\">@elle88531</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml54HW9XgjnYRS5IySPyLmg\">@allyp1023</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4NVT36WtTA9yZHRpgKDp0g\">@itsemmyb</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YMu3WxBCnnIZhTYWC07Ew\">@kgbrenner</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_d5TEDyyflGSxhvGDYd3nw\">@violinbetty</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdCEpSWXTDp4RlmDZEKlsRQ\">@jade-taillia</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-rphpEN2JYj5ks7GhXT2NA\">@sarahp879</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQrgsmzlp43kRsBK1OgYU3A\">@raquegp02</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjW7i5rkE1EoH84r-7psX6g\">@rileyloves5</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHVBwwh7FYw8NqsOxw5lU5A\">@flashfanfics</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-DRdd55zVXiUAeCSgnUnhQ\">@pigwidgexn</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrKxLogMT8ZRX6bEe4cre_A\">@bfuckjames</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzmhiAhdx-r0LJpHZ3QJJKQ\">@pcterpvrker</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/manO6wuvKs0i-zALO25W5Eg\">@bluebird214</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSnTWCmjnS-bS7Fbhpj3rag\">@wandressfox</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNp3ooDgio73B-I_XHqvVPQ\">@amandab-ftw</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQxq9pqtJWSHDaPfB-ilG_g\">@henrietteoaks</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4W3-6NwgB8G7UzMqEwJQzQ\">@bettercallsabs</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdSnsev6a3seawNTSnhobCA\">@akschoenborn</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcR8Qy5H7_sxinRp4AIausQ\">@lucifersnipnips</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIHYPrA9K17DaZ-8cJT_QYA\">@queenkrissy11</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mheS4EfFwvnlNLEuAFjkgbA\">@destiel-artemis</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhEWNzhyqv9JOab4jt8q_hw\">@freakingnerd99</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDLcx0ai0Bge8ukv6L-7sHg\">@sweet-honey15</a> <br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFwsC3hNBmAK7tQoOGbY-_w\">@mellxander1993</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrwMU-N1eyWBqA1K5ic9qWQ\">@geeksareunique</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m12TpFK-9Q5fJI1M4amPi5Q\">@petersunderroos</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFgUWNDbx_5iFCFmLgYTbfA\">@supernatural508</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpXQg3IwvcpFIyAZa3X7hzg\">@mariekoukie6661</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLLKe0ai32q0pHD9A1g2R2g\">@lovemarvelousfics</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwKU-V9XlfGAXwQ_VKpKGcg\">@futuremrsb-r-main</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mATyRLXXpY4c6rZ3JG4ilDQ\">@booktvmoviefangirl</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNJoAjB3Kx4KCu03jmPRzpA\">@justmeinthisworldblr</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myyceKIAqMHADYyZ86ZepwA\">@nerdyandexhausted</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8uLNHbhfehEqvAArAxhOVQ\">@supernaturaldean67</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqTRDgsPHPygUiOmoEFRgNQ\">@writingaworldofmyown</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9FbkwjNxTKhnd1j8rudhlQ\">@villainsaremorerelatable</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvukr8lRkKPc7nG2z1tYUkA\">@wandamaximoffforqueen</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOy4iqFrF2gcYgDHCYnyIbw\">@ocaptain-mycaptainmorgan</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqQfVkahriCCsdQewDmhMnA\">@crazy-little-thing-called-buck</a><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZrDKOEjDHfGdcOpeVeVPCw\">@lesmiserablememelovingfuck</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmLzekPqCV8Tg9miEeECKhg\">@teenagetragediesforeveryone</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLqLl0ejJDMoaJw31Etn_-g\">@letsgetfuckingsuperwholocked</a> &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcJXvK63t0GYfqpDg3GBARw\">@stupendoussciencenaturepanda</a> &nbsp;

The hospital provided a bed next to yours where she would sleep a few hours but never peacefully. </p><p>The medias (TV and social) were going crazy. Searching for every detail regarding your life to know why that women would do what she did. The fans showed support online everyday, not only towards your family but also the Marvel crew. Other celebrities posted messages wishing you would be back soon and showing support to your friends and family. The cast tried to pass by the hospital when they could, but since the press was going to start soon, they had to leave to other states, but they called or texted your brother every single day for updates. Tessa came by as many times as she could, trying to bring you back by telling how her day went, what she wanted you both to experience and do once you\u2019d wake up. Always leaving after pressing a peck on your lips and come back the following day.</p><p>On the fourth day, Sebastian came by the hospital. He knocked softly on the door and your mother opened it. \u00ab Hello Mrs Williamsons, I\u2019m sorry to disturb, I just wanted to see her. \u00bb She gave him a small hug and gesticulating for him to enter. \u00ab Hello Sebastian. No problem and please call me Julia. \u00bb Sebastian took a seat at your left and couldn\u2019t miss the scars on your broken leg. His breath got stuck in his throat and he swallowed harshly, clenching his jaw. Sensing the man\u2019s emotion, your mother stood up, \u00ab Is it alright if I go downstairs grab something to eat? \u00bb, she told him. He nodded and whispered \u00ab Yes of course. I\u2019ll stay here. \u00bb She nodded and left. He sat closely and looked at your state. \u00ab Hey Y/N, it\u2019s Seb. I don\u2019t know if you can hear me but I\u2019m here with you \u00bb, his voice cracked. He cleared his throat before continuing. \u00ab Everyone misses you\u2026I miss you. So much. \u00bb\u00a0</p><p>He stayed quiet for a few minutes, not sure if he should say what he had in his heart. \u00ab We\u2026 didn\u2019t know you were with Tessa. It caught us by surprise. Us the ones crushing on you. I should have made a move but was scared. I\u2019m sorry. But right know it\u2019s not important. What matters is that you wake up. We need you\u2026I need you in my life, even if it means we only get to be friends. I wish only the best for you and if being with Tessa makes you happy, then wake up for her. Come back. \u00bb The actor felt something wet sliding down his face and noticed that he was crying silently. He cleaned his face with the back of his hand and squeezed your hand gently. Your mother entered again in the room and saw his glossy eyes. She patted affectionally his shoulder and gave him a small smile. He stood up and gave you a slow kiss on your forehead. He said goodbye and left. </p><p><b>Four weeks later</b> and still nothing - no movement, no signs of improvement even if you were stable. The media finally got the reason of the whole accident, since your parents announced publicly that they were suing Carol. The court was due in a week from now and they gained even more support once knowing the whole story - people praising them as good parents and good people since they saved you 27 years ago. Your parents were currently in the court house with their lawyer, preparing for the first trial while your brother was beside your hospital bed. He began to tremble and took your hand. \u00ab Y/N it\u2019s enough now. You have to wake the fuck up ! Stop being selfish for the love of God and make us wait like this. Come back ! \u00bb, he said desperately. His voice began to become louder. \u00ab WAKE THE FUCK UP Y/N. WE NEED YOU. DON\u2019T LEAVE US LIKE THIS. PLEASE SISTER, WAKE UP \u00bb, he said so loudly that a nurse entered the room. \u00ab Sir, I have to tell you to leave the room \u00bb, she said kind of scared. \u00ab WAKE UP PLEASE \u00bb, he said one last time, when he felt your fingers move slightly. He gasped and turned towards the nurse \u00ab Her fingers moved. Call a doctor fast, please. \u00bb The nurse came closer and looked attentively at your fingers and a few seconds later, they moved again. \u00ab Omg \u00bb, she gasped and ran outside. A minutes after that, the doctor entered and examined you. A bright smile appeared on his face. \u00ab Keep talking to her \u00bb, he told your brother, who\u2019s body was producing tears of joy. \u00ab Y/N it\u2019s Marc. Please come back. We miss you so much, please open your eyes. \u00bb The pressure of your fingers became harder on his hand and he laughed mixed with tears. \u00ab Yes like that sister, come back. \u00bb </p><p>He took his phone out and called your parents and put on loudspeaker \u00ab Marc is everything alright? \u00bb, your father asked afraid. \u00ab She\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s coming back Dad. Her fingers are moving. She\u2019s back. \u00bb No response on the other side of the phone. \u00ab Dad? \u00bb. \u00ab We\u2019re..on our way. Thank God. Omg thank you. My baby. \u00bb, he cried too. </p><p>Everything was black and all that noise was unbearable. \u00ab Shhh \u00bb, your mind tried to scream. All that noise and those voices. The darkness began to fade away and a weak light to appear. It was coming closer and closer by the second. You felt your eyes heavy. Everything was blurred but you knew that faces were in front of you, only they were distorted like some Kandinsky painting. Abstract, unrecognizable. Your eyes finally adapted to your surroundings and three people were in front of you. A woman in a blue blouse, a man in a white blouse and a man, crying. Why was he crying and smiling at the same time. \u2018This is so confusing\u2019, you thought. \u00ab Y/N? \u00bb, asked the one in white blouse. Your head turned to him and he smiled. \u00ab Alright she knows her name, it\u2019s a good sign. \u00bb </p><p>\u00ab Y/N? Do you know who I am? \u00bb, asked the other man. You opened your mouth but a terrible cough took over. The nurse grabbed a glass filled with water and pressed the cold glass against your lips. Your throat hurt like hell. Their eyes were looking at you like you were the Messiah and it made you uncomfortable. \u00ab Do you recognize me? \u00bb, the man asked again. \u00ab Why are you crying Marc? \u00bb, you answered weakly, confused. \u00ab God you scarred the hell out of us \u00bb, he said. You looked around you and realized you were in a hospital bed, the pointy needle inserted profoundly on your hand. \u00ab Tessa\u2026she\u2019s\u2026the airport \u00bb, you stuttered weakly. \u00ab Hey hey don\u2019t worry about that \u00bb, he immediately calmed you down. \u00ab Y/N I\u2019m doctor Smith. What was the last thing you remember? \u00bb, he asked. The room was silent again before you spoke \u00ab I was in the car and then darkness. \u00bb He nodded and smiled and asked you if you knew your parents\u2019s names. You frowned and said \u00ab Julia and Tom. Why? Where are they? \u00bb, your heart began to beat faster. \u00ab They\u2019re on their way Y/N \u00bb, replied Marc holding your hand. \u00ab I\u2019ve been in the department for 9 years and it\u2019s the first time I see this. It\u2019s a miracle. She remembers \u00bb, mumbled the doctor and turned towards Marc \u00ab We\u2019ll need to run some more tests but what I\u2019m seeing here is promising. \u00bb </p><h2><b>30 minutes earlier</b></h2><p>\u00ab Case Williamsons vs Carol Collins. First session is open \u00bb, exclaimed loudly the Judge and slammed his hammer. The court house was full - family, friends in one side and journalists, reporters and Carol\u2019s lawyer on the other. Behind your parents, were some members of the cast showing them support such as RDJ and Mark Ruffalo with their wives. They let Carol enter the court and the people in the room began to boo her. She walked and looked at your parents with a proud smirk. \u00ab SILENCE ! \u00bb, slammed the Judge with the hammer. The Judge faced Carol and asked her lawyer \u00ab Your client is accused of blackmail, harassement and attempted murder, how do you plead? \u00bb Carol\u2019s attorney stood up and declared \u00ab <b>Not guilty, your Honor</b>! \u00bb. His words let out another wave of indignation. Once again he demanded that the room stood silent. The Judge looked at your parents and asked \u00ab Do you have any evidence or prouve that goes against this pleading? \u00bb Your parents\u2019s attorney stood up and said \u00ab Yes your Honor \u00bb. He nodded and told them to begin. He was in the middle to show the first evidences against Carol when your father\u2019s phone rang. The Judge seemed annoyed and your father begged him if he could take it. He accepted and after hearing the voice behind, he gasped. Your mother looked at him scarred until he declared \u00ab We\u2019re on our way thank God. \u00bb He ended the call and addressed the Judge. \u00ab Your Honor, my son just told me that Y/N Williamsons, my daughter just woke up from coma. \u00bb The room erupted in cheers and the Judge had to calm the euphoria again. \u00ab Since the victim is now awake, the trial is suspended for another week. Go join your daughter \u00bb, exclaimed the Judge. Your parents immediately ran out of the room and got as fast as they could to their car. </p><h2><b>In the hospital</b></h2><p><i>\u00ab I\u2019ve been in the department for 9 years and it\u2019s the first time I see this.

Confused you patted her back. \u00ab Mom? \u00bb, you whispered. She took your face in her hands and kissed your cheeks. Next was your father. \u00ab Anyone care yo explain? \u00bb, you stated. \u00ab Honey, you\u2019ve been in an accident, more or less \u00bb, your father told you through greeted teeth. \u00ab You\u2019ve been in the coma for 5 weeks \u00bb, continued Mark. You gasped but no words escaped your mouth. \u00ab Baby? \u00bb, said your mother softly. You turned her way and saw clean the remaining tears. \u00ab It was Carol. She\u2026she tried to take you from us \u00bb, your mother revealed. \u00ab What? \u00bb, you whispered. \u00ab She was behind the \u2018\u2019accident\u2019\u2019. She was furious when we cut the money so she wanted to make us suffer by taking your life \u00bb, continued your father. You tried to say something but nothing came out. Was it shock? Was it bewilderment that she could go that far for cash? You didn\u2019t know. The only thing you knew was that she was bad and that you were going to drag her fucking ass to jail. \u00ab I\u2019m sorry \u00bb, was the only thing that you could say. \u00ab No no no honey, it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s hers. She will pay for what she did. Trust me \u00bb, replied your father firmly. </p><p>\u00ab Tessa? \u00bb, you asked. Mark smiled and said \u00ab I already send a group message to the whole cast. RDJ and Ruffallo are already in the waiting room. They were present at the court. \u00bb You nodded and hugged as good as you could your parents and brother.</p><p><b>PERMANENT TAG LIST</b>: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVNnuCxaSr0DKoNjYpQkM7g\" target=\"_blank\">@arrowswithwifi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCQXLBP-e3ar0rrwHcWggg\" target=\"_blank\">@poetic-pixie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\" target=\"_blank\">@theshortegg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\" target=\"_blank\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVFWgbxy6uE7nyh7nrquQPw\" target=\"_blank\">@prettybubblesintheair</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\" target=\"_blank\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAFfKJc5cRm1VdTDpK4e3FQ\" target=\"_blank\">@marshmallow-witch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLHxzHDO4l4FZl6LBenK8Jw\" target=\"_blank\">@ms-cellanies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcSY5dkyLEarvd9khMIHCLg\" target=\"_blank\">@the-feckless-wonder</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfPEU5UnBolUmhNiBp0BcDw\" target=\"_blank\">@cfisher290</a>\u00a0@gypsystrangerkeefhawfromtexas <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m98boJ2QskB9tCvhYvexAng\" target=\"_blank\">@thefangirltheycallviolet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQbXOvBF-Wk6l3VnFl6P4UA\" target=\"_blank\">@river-fics</a> @honey-kitschlokithotties <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\" target=\"_blank\">@lilulo-12</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw12zrVmzmGtZLdQ-0rIYTA\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfictionrecommendations-com</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myNyZ5OjH2V2A_8CxhT8JHg\" target=\"_blank\">@spetzerfehn</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmvRpuSWzlyumW0TxBEvYGg\" target=\"_blank\">@angieptt</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muIMbGBGHBRBSh_vW3WaBYg\" target=\"_blank\">@wayward-timetravel-collecter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjYGTbvw43pAoujc4b09x9w\" target=\"_blank\">@rikkirikki</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLRpNUWZa7qH-ulOAQGrqnA\" target=\"_blank\">@ashley17jacobs</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yiskJOcz7k_nOLRaHq7iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@lokithedancingqueen</a> @raiprericnitertiodafo <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7rXAgLvNHsSUkb8lGnyeg\" target=\"_blank\">@wildsoul1221</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\" target=\"_blank\">@introvertedsin</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVHoOn4Mp7db-vSptBegww\" target=\"_blank\">@robertconradjr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG1r5oWA94EYf_LS8xLxlYA\" target=\"_blank\">@thesilverlioness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6e0nhW809mI7ErYzKY-7ag\" target=\"_blank\">@francezka10</a></p>",

            "comment": "<p><h1>Rio pra n\u00e3o chorar - Part 7</h1><p><b>Pairing : Tessa Thompson x Plus Size Reader</b></p><p><b>Warnings</b> : Language ; grammar/spelling mistakes ; angst</p><p><b>Word Count</b> : 1.9k</p><h2><b>Week 1</b></h2><p>The first two nights your mother refused to leave your side, even with your father and brother protesting that she need to go home, take a shower and some rest she refused. \u00ab I\u2019m not leaving my child. \u00bb, she stated with such firmness that no one would dare to contradict her. The hospital provided a bed next to yours where she would sleep a few hours but never peacefully. </p><p>The medias (TV and social) were going crazy. Searching for every detail regarding your life to know why that women would do what she did. The fans showed support online everyday, not only towards your family but also the Marvel crew. Other celebrities posted messages wishing you would be back soon and showing support to your friends and family. The cast tried to pass by the hospital when they could, but since the press was going to start soon, they had to leave to other states, but they called or texted your brother every single day for updates. Tessa came by as many times as she could, trying to bring you back by telling how her day went, what she wanted you both to experience and do once you\u2019d wake up. Always leaving after pressing a peck on your lips and come back the following day.</p><p>On the fourth day, Sebastian came by the hospital. He knocked softly on the door and your mother opened it. \u00ab Hello Mrs Williamsons, I\u2019m sorry to disturb, I just wanted to see her. \u00bb She gave him a small hug and gesticulating for him to enter. \u00ab Hello Sebastian. No problem and please call me Julia. \u00bb Sebastian took a seat at your left and couldn\u2019t miss the scars on your broken leg. His breath got stuck in his throat and he swallowed harshly, clenching his jaw. Sensing the man\u2019s emotion, your mother stood up, \u00ab Is it alright if I go downstairs grab something to eat? \u00bb, she told him. He nodded and whispered \u00ab Yes of course. I\u2019ll stay here. \u00bb She nodded and left. He sat closely and looked at your state. \u00ab Hey Y/N, it\u2019s Seb. I don\u2019t know if you can hear me but I\u2019m here with you \u00bb, his voice cracked. He cleared his throat before continuing. \u00ab Everyone misses you\u2026I miss you. So much. \u00bb\u00a0</p><p>He stayed quiet for a few minutes, not sure if he should say what he had in his heart. \u00ab We\u2026 didn\u2019t know you were with Tessa. It caught us by surprise. Us the ones crushing on you. I should have made a move but was scared. I\u2019m sorry. But right know it\u2019s not important. What matters is that you wake up. We need you\u2026I need you in my life, even if it means we only get to be friends. I wish only the best for you and if being with Tessa makes you happy, then wake up for her. Come back. \u00bb The actor felt something wet sliding down his face and noticed that he was crying silently. He cleaned his face with the back of his hand and squeezed your hand gently. Your mother entered again in the room and saw his glossy eyes. She patted affectionally his shoulder and gave him a small smile. He stood up and gave you a slow kiss on your forehead. He said goodbye and left. </p><p><b>Four weeks later</b> and still nothing - no movement, no signs of improvement even if you were stable. The media finally got the reason of the whole accident, since your parents announced publicly that they were suing Carol. The court was due in a week from now and they gained even more support once knowing the whole story - people praising them as good parents and good people since they saved you 27 years ago. Your parents were currently in the court house with their lawyer, preparing for the first trial while your brother was beside your hospital bed. He began to tremble and took your hand. \u00ab Y/N it\u2019s enough now. You have to wake the fuck up ! Stop being selfish for the love of God and make us wait like this. Come back ! \u00bb, he said desperately. His voice began to become louder. \u00ab WAKE THE FUCK UP Y/N. WE NEED YOU. DON\u2019T LEAVE US LIKE THIS. PLEASE SISTER, WAKE UP \u00bb, he said so loudly that a nurse entered the room. \u00ab Sir, I have to tell you to leave the room \u00bb, she said kind of scared. \u00ab WAKE UP PLEASE \u00bb, he said one last time, when he felt your fingers move slightly. He gasped and turned towards the nurse \u00ab Her fingers moved. Call a doctor fast, please. \u00bb The nurse came closer and looked attentively at your fingers and a few seconds later, they moved again. \u00ab Omg \u00bb, she gasped and ran outside. A minutes after that, the doctor entered and examined you. A bright smile appeared on his face. \u00ab Keep talking to her \u00bb, he told your brother, who\u2019s body was producing tears of joy. \u00ab Y/N it\u2019s Marc. Please come back. We miss you so much, please open your eyes. \u00bb The pressure of your fingers became harder on his hand and he laughed mixed with tears. \u00ab Yes like that sister, come back. \u00bb </p><p>He took his phone out and called your parents and put on loudspeaker \u00ab Marc is everything alright? \u00bb, your father asked afraid. \u00ab She\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s coming back Dad. Her fingers are moving. She\u2019s back. \u00bb No response on the other side of the phone. \u00ab Dad? \u00bb. \u00ab We\u2019re..on our way. Thank God. Omg thank you. My baby. \u00bb, he cried too. </p><p>Everything was black and all that noise was unbearable. \u00ab Shhh \u00bb, your mind tried to scream. All that noise and those voices. The darkness began to fade away and a weak light to appear. It was coming closer and closer by the second. You felt your eyes heavy. Everything was blurred but you knew that faces were in front of you, only they were distorted like some Kandinsky painting. Abstract, unrecognizable. Your eyes finally adapted to your surroundings and three people were in front of you. A woman in a blue blouse, a man in a white blouse and a man, crying. Why was he crying and smiling at the same time. \u2018This is so confusing\u2019, you thought. \u00ab Y/N? \u00bb, asked the one in white blouse. Your head turned to him and he smiled. \u00ab Alright she knows her name, it\u2019s a good sign. \u00bb </p><p>\u00ab Y/N? Do you know who I am? \u00bb, asked the other man. You opened your mouth but a terrible cough took over. The nurse grabbed a glass filled with water and pressed the cold glass against your lips. Your throat hurt like hell. Their eyes were looking at you like you were the Messiah and it made you uncomfortable. \u00ab Do you recognize me? \u00bb, the man asked again. \u00ab Why are you crying Marc? \u00bb, you answered weakly, confused. \u00ab God you scarred the hell out of us \u00bb, he said.

You frowned and said \u00ab Julia and Tom. Why? Where are they? \u00bb, your heart began to beat faster. \u00ab They\u2019re on their way Y/N \u00bb, replied Marc holding your hand. \u00ab I\u2019ve been in the department for 9 years and it\u2019s the first time I see this. It\u2019s a miracle. She remembers \u00bb, mumbled the doctor and turned towards Marc \u00ab We\u2019ll need to run some more tests but what I\u2019m seeing here is promising. \u00bb </p><h2><b>30 minutes earlier</b></h2><p>\u00ab Case Williamsons vs Carol Collins.

The hospital provided a bed next to yours where she would sleep a few hours but never peacefully. </p><p>The medias (TV and social) were going crazy. Searching for every detail regarding your life to know why that women would do what she did. The fans showed support online everyday, not only towards your family but also the Marvel crew. Other celebrities posted messages wishing you would be back soon and showing support to your friends and family. The cast tried to pass by the hospital when they could, but since the press was going to start soon, they had to leave to other states, but they called or texted your brother every single day for updates. Tessa came by as many times as she could, trying to bring you back by telling how her day went, what she wanted you both to experience and do once you\u2019d wake up. Always leaving after pressing a peck on your lips and come back the following day.</p><p>On the fourth day, Sebastian came by the hospital. He knocked softly on the door and your mother opened it. \u00ab Hello Mrs Williamsons, I\u2019m sorry to disturb, I just wanted to see her. \u00bb She gave him a small hug and gesticulating for him to enter. \u00ab Hello Sebastian. No problem and please call me Julia. \u00bb Sebastian took a seat at your left and couldn\u2019t miss the scars on your broken leg. His breath got stuck in his throat and he swallowed harshly, clenching his jaw. Sensing the man\u2019s emotion, your mother stood up, \u00ab Is it alright if I go downstairs grab something to eat? \u00bb, she told him. He nodded and whispered \u00ab Yes of course. I\u2019ll stay here. \u00bb She nodded and left. He sat closely and looked at your state. \u00ab Hey Y/N, it\u2019s Seb. I don\u2019t know if you can hear me but I\u2019m here with you \u00bb, his voice cracked. He cleared his throat before continuing. \u00ab Everyone misses you\u2026I miss you. So much. \u00bb\u00a0</p><p>He stayed quiet for a few minutes, not sure if he should say what he had in his heart. \u00ab We\u2026 didn\u2019t know you were with Tessa. It caught us by surprise. Us the ones crushing on you. I should have made a move but was scared. I\u2019m sorry. But right know it\u2019s not important. What matters is that you wake up. We need you\u2026I need you in my life, even if it means we only get to be friends. I wish only the best for you and if being with Tessa makes you happy, then wake up for her. Come back. \u00bb The actor felt something wet sliding down his face and noticed that he was crying silently. He cleaned his face with the back of his hand and squeezed your hand gently. Your mother entered again in the room and saw his glossy eyes. She patted affectionally his shoulder and gave him a small smile. He stood up and gave you a slow kiss on your forehead. He said goodbye and left. </p><p><b>Four weeks later</b> and still nothing - no movement, no signs of improvement even if you were stable. The media finally got the reason of the whole accident, since your parents announced publicly that they were suing Carol. The court was due in a week from now and they gained even more support once knowing the whole story - people praising them as good parents and good people since they saved you 27 years ago. Your parents were currently in the court house with their lawyer, preparing for the first trial while your brother was beside your hospital bed. He began to tremble and took your hand. \u00ab Y/N it\u2019s enough now. You have to wake the fuck up ! Stop being selfish for the love of God and make us wait like this. Come back ! \u00bb, he said desperately. His voice began to become louder. \u00ab WAKE THE FUCK UP Y/N. WE NEED YOU. DON\u2019T LEAVE US LIKE THIS. PLEASE SISTER, WAKE UP \u00bb, he said so loudly that a nurse entered the room. \u00ab Sir, I have to tell you to leave the room \u00bb, she said kind of scared. \u00ab WAKE UP PLEASE \u00bb, he said one last time, when he felt your fingers move slightly. He gasped and turned towards the nurse \u00ab Her fingers moved. Call a doctor fast, please. \u00bb The nurse came closer and looked attentively at your fingers and a few seconds later, they moved again. \u00ab Omg \u00bb, she gasped and ran outside. A minutes after that, the doctor entered and examined you. A bright smile appeared on his face. \u00ab Keep talking to her \u00bb, he told your brother, who\u2019s body was producing tears of joy. \u00ab Y/N it\u2019s Marc. Please come back. We miss you so much, please open your eyes. \u00bb The pressure of your fingers became harder on his hand and he laughed mixed with tears. \u00ab Yes like that sister, come back. \u00bb </p><p>He took his phone out and called your parents and put on loudspeaker \u00ab Marc is everything alright? \u00bb, your father asked afraid. \u00ab She\u2019s\u2026she\u2019s coming back Dad. Her fingers are moving. She\u2019s back. \u00bb No response on the other side of the phone. \u00ab Dad? \u00bb. \u00ab We\u2019re..on our way. Thank God. Omg thank you. My baby. \u00bb, he cried too. </p><p>Everything was black and all that noise was unbearable. \u00ab Shhh \u00bb, your mind tried to scream. All that noise and those voices. The darkness began to fade away and a weak light to appear. It was coming closer and closer by the second. You felt your eyes heavy. Everything was blurred but you knew that faces were in front of you, only they were distorted like some Kandinsky painting. Abstract, unrecognizable. Your eyes finally adapted to your surroundings and three people were in front of you. A woman in a blue blouse, a man in a white blouse and a man, crying. Why was he crying and smiling at the same time. \u2018This is so confusing\u2019, you thought. \u00ab Y/N? \u00bb, asked the one in white blouse. Your head turned to him and he smiled. \u00ab Alright she knows her name, it\u2019s a good sign. \u00bb </p><p>\u00ab Y/N? Do you know who I am? \u00bb, asked the other man. You opened your mouth but a terrible cough took over. The nurse grabbed a glass filled with water and pressed the cold glass against your lips. Your throat hurt like hell. Their eyes were looking at you like you were the Messiah and it made you uncomfortable. \u00ab Do you recognize me? \u00bb, the man asked again. \u00ab Why are you crying Marc? \u00bb, you answered weakly, confused. \u00ab God you scarred the hell out of us \u00bb, he said. You looked around you and realized you were in a hospital bed, the pointy needle inserted profoundly on your hand. \u00ab Tessa\u2026she\u2019s\u2026the airport \u00bb, you stuttered weakly. \u00ab Hey hey don\u2019t worry about that \u00bb, he immediately calmed you down. \u00ab Y/N I\u2019m doctor Smith. What was the last thing you remember? \u00bb, he asked. The room was silent again before you spoke \u00ab I was in the car and then darkness. \u00bb He nodded and smiled and asked you if you knew your parents\u2019s names. You frowned and said \u00ab Julia and Tom. Why? Where are they? \u00bb, your heart began to beat faster. \u00ab They\u2019re on their way Y/N \u00bb, replied Marc holding your hand. \u00ab I\u2019ve been in the department for 9 years and it\u2019s the first time I see this. It\u2019s a miracle. She remembers \u00bb, mumbled the doctor and turned towards Marc \u00ab We\u2019ll need to run some more tests but what I\u2019m seeing here is promising. \u00bb </p><h2><b>30 minutes earlier</b></h2><p>\u00ab Case Williamsons vs Carol Collins. First session is open \u00bb, exclaimed loudly the Judge and slammed his hammer. The court house was full - family, friends in one side and journalists, reporters and Carol\u2019s lawyer on the other. Behind your parents, were some members of the cast showing them support such as RDJ and Mark Ruffalo with their wives. They let Carol enter the court and the people in the room began to boo her. She walked and looked at your parents with a proud smirk. \u00ab SILENCE ! \u00bb, slammed the Judge with the hammer. The Judge faced Carol and asked her lawyer \u00ab Your client is accused of blackmail, harassement and attempted murder, how do you plead? \u00bb Carol\u2019s attorney stood up and declared \u00ab <b>Not guilty, your Honor</b>! \u00bb. His words let out another wave of indignation. Once again he demanded that the room stood silent. The Judge looked at your parents and asked \u00ab Do you have any evidence or prouve that goes against this pleading? \u00bb Your parents\u2019s attorney stood up and said \u00ab Yes your Honor \u00bb. He nodded and told them to begin. He was in the middle to show the first evidences against Carol when your father\u2019s phone rang. The Judge seemed annoyed and your father begged him if he could take it. He accepted and after hearing the voice behind, he gasped. Your mother looked at him scarred until he declared \u00ab We\u2019re on our way thank God. \u00bb He ended the call and addressed the Judge. \u00ab Your Honor, my son just told me that Y/N Williamsons, my daughter just woke up from coma. \u00bb The room erupted in cheers and the Judge had to calm the euphoria again. \u00ab Since the victim is now awake, the trial is suspended for another week. Go join your daughter \u00bb, exclaimed the Judge. Your parents immediately ran out of the room and got as fast as they could to their car. </p><h2><b>In the hospital</b></h2><p><i>\u00ab I\u2019ve been in the department for 9 years and it\u2019s the first time I see this. It\u2019s a miracle. She remembers \u00bb, mumbled the doctor and turned towards Marc \u00ab We\u2019ll need to run some more tests but what I\u2019m seeing here is promising. \u00bb</i></p><p>You were about to say something when the door opened and parents stormed in. \u00ab Baby \u00bb, cried your mother and embraced you. Confused you patted her back. \u00ab Mom? \u00bb, you whispered. She took your face in her hands and kissed your cheeks. Next was your father. \u00ab Anyone care yo explain? \u00bb, you stated. \u00ab Honey, you\u2019ve been in an accident, more or less \u00bb, your father told you through greeted teeth. \u00ab You\u2019ve been in the coma for 5 weeks \u00bb, continued Mark. You gasped but no words escaped your mouth. \u00ab Baby? \u00bb, said your mother softly. You turned her way and saw clean the remaining tears. \u00ab It was Carol. She\u2026she tried to take you from us \u00bb, your mother revealed. \u00ab What? \u00bb, you whispered. \u00ab She was behind the \u2018\u2019accident\u2019\u2019. She was furious when we cut the money so she wanted to make us suffer by taking your life \u00bb, continued your father. You tried to say something but nothing came out. Was it shock? Was it bewilderment that she could go that far for cash? You didn\u2019t know. The only thing you knew was that she was bad and that you were going to drag her fucking ass to jail. \u00ab I\u2019m sorry \u00bb, was the only thing that you could say. \u00ab No no no honey, it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s hers. She will pay for what she did. Trust me \u00bb, replied your father firmly. </p><p>\u00ab Tessa? \u00bb, you asked. Mark smiled and said \u00ab I already send a group message to the whole cast. RDJ and Ruffallo are already in the waiting room. They were present at the court. \u00bb You nodded and hugged as good as you could your parents and brother.</p><p><b>PERMANENT TAG LIST</b>: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVNnuCxaSr0DKoNjYpQkM7g\" target=\"_blank\">@arrowswithwifi</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCQXLBP-e3ar0rrwHcWggg\" target=\"_blank\">@poetic-pixie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\" target=\"_blank\">@theshortegg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\" target=\"_blank\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVFWgbxy6uE7nyh7nrquQPw\" target=\"_blank\">@prettybubblesintheair</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\" target=\"_blank\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAFfKJc5cRm1VdTDpK4e3FQ\" target=\"_blank\">@marshmallow-witch</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLHxzHDO4l4FZl6LBenK8Jw\" target=\"_blank\">@ms-cellanies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcSY5dkyLEarvd9khMIHCLg\" target=\"_blank\">@the-feckless-wonder</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfPEU5UnBolUmhNiBp0BcDw\" target=\"_blank\">@cfisher290</a>\u00a0@gypsystrangerkeefhawfromtexas <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m98boJ2QskB9tCvhYvexAng\" target=\"_blank\">@thefangirltheycallviolet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQbXOvBF-Wk6l3VnFl6P4UA\" target=\"_blank\">@river-fics</a> @honey-kitschlokithotties <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\" target=\"_blank\">@lilulo-12</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw12zrVmzmGtZLdQ-0rIYTA\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfictionrecommendations-com</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myNyZ5OjH2V2A_8CxhT8JHg\" target=\"_blank\">@spetzerfehn</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmvRpuSWzlyumW0TxBEvYGg\" target=\"_blank\">@angieptt</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muIMbGBGHBRBSh_vW3WaBYg\" target=\"_blank\">@wayward-timetravel-collecter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjYGTbvw43pAoujc4b09x9w\" target=\"_blank\">@rikkirikki</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLRpNUWZa7qH-ulOAQGrqnA\" target=\"_blank\">@ashley17jacobs</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yiskJOcz7k_nOLRaHq7iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@lokithedancingqueen</a> @raiprericnitertiodafo <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7rXAgLvNHsSUkb8lGnyeg\" target=\"_blank\">@wildsoul1221</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\" target=\"_blank\">@introvertedsin</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVHoOn4Mp7db-vSptBegww\" target=\"_blank\">@robertconradjr</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG1r5oWA94EYf_LS8xLxlYA\" target=\"_blank\">@thesilverlioness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6e0nhW809mI7ErYzKY-7ag\" target=\"_blank\">@francezka10</a></p></p>",

The Judge faced Carol and asked her lawyer &laquo; Your client is accused of blackmail, harassement and attempted murder, how do you plead? &raquo; Carol&rsquo;s attorney stood up and declared &laquo; <b>Not guilty, your Honor</b>! &raquo;. His words let out another wave of indignation. Once again he demanded that the room stood silent. The Judge looked at your parents and asked &laquo; Do you have any evidence or prouve that goes against this pleading? &raquo; Your parents&rsquo;s attorney stood up and said &laquo; Yes your Honor &raquo;. He nodded and told them to begin. He was in the middle to show the first evidences against Carol when your father&rsquo;s phone rang. The Judge seemed annoyed and your father begged him if he could take it. He accepted and after hearing the voice behind, he gasped. Your mother looked at him scarred until he declared &laquo; We&rsquo;re on our way thank God. &raquo; He ended the call and addressed the Judge. &laquo; Your Honor, my son just told me that Y/N Williamsons, my daughter just woke up from coma. &raquo; The room erupted in cheers and the Judge had to calm the euphoria again. &laquo; Since the victim is now awake, the trial is suspended for another week. Go join your daughter &raquo;, exclaimed the Judge. Your parents immediately ran out of the room and got as fast as they could to their car. </p><h2><b>In the hospital</b></h2><p><i>&laquo; I&rsquo;ve been in the department for 9 years and it&rsquo;s the first time I see this. It&rsquo;s a miracle. She remembers &raquo;, mumbled the doctor and turned towards Marc &laquo; We&rsquo;ll need to run some more tests but what I&rsquo;m seeing here is promising. &raquo;</i></p><p>You were about to say something when the door opened and parents stormed in. &laquo; Baby &raquo;, cried your mother and embraced you. Confused you patted her back. &laquo; Mom? &raquo;, you whispered. She took your face in her hands and kissed your cheeks. Next was your father. &laquo; Anyone care yo explain? &raquo;, you stated. &laquo; Honey, you&rsquo;ve been in an accident, more or less &raquo;, your father told you through greeted teeth. &laquo; You&rsquo;ve been in the coma for 5 weeks &raquo;, continued Mark. You gasped but no words escaped your mouth. &laquo; Baby? &raquo;, said your mother softly. You turned her way and saw clean the remaining tears. &laquo; It was Carol. She&hellip;she tried to take you from us &raquo;, your mother revealed. &laquo; What? &raquo;, you whispered. &laquo; She was behind the &lsquo;&rsquo;accident&rsquo;&rsquo;. She was furious when we cut the money so she wanted to make us suffer by taking your life &raquo;, continued your father. You tried to say something but nothing came out. Was it shock? Was it bewilderment that she could go that far for cash? You didn&rsquo;t know. The only thing you knew was that she was bad and that you were going to drag her fucking ass to jail. &laquo; I&rsquo;m sorry &raquo;, was the only thing that you could say. &laquo; No no no honey, it&rsquo;s not your fault. It&rsquo;s hers. She will pay for what she did. Trust me &raquo;, replied your father firmly. </p><p>&laquo; Tessa? &raquo;, you asked. Mark smiled and said &laquo; I already send a group message to the whole cast. RDJ and Ruffallo are already in the waiting room. They were present at the court. &raquo; You nodded and hugged as good as you could your parents and brother.</p><p><b>PERMANENT TAG LIST</b>: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVNnuCxaSr0DKoNjYpQkM7g\" target=\"_blank\">@arrowswithwifi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCQXLBP-e3ar0rrwHcWggg\" target=\"_blank\">@poetic-pixie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\" target=\"_blank\">@theshortegg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\" target=\"_blank\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVFWgbxy6uE7nyh7nrquQPw\" target=\"_blank\">@prettybubblesintheair</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFmpGRjCwmu-OpV-wKJ_kwA\" target=\"_blank\">@yafriendlyfangirl</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAFfKJc5cRm1VdTDpK4e3FQ\" target=\"_blank\">@marshmallow-witch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLHxzHDO4l4FZl6LBenK8Jw\" target=\"_blank\">@ms-cellanies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcSY5dkyLEarvd9khMIHCLg\" target=\"_blank\">@the-feckless-wonder</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfPEU5UnBolUmhNiBp0BcDw\" target=\"_blank\">@cfisher290</a>&nbsp;@gypsystrangerkeefhawfromtexas <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m98boJ2QskB9tCvhYvexAng\" target=\"_blank\">@thefangirltheycallviolet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQbXOvBF-Wk6l3VnFl6P4UA\" target=\"_blank\">@river-fics</a> @honey-kitschlokithotties <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\" target=\"_blank\">@lilulo-12</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw12zrVmzmGtZLdQ-0rIYTA\" target=\"_blank\">@fanfictionrecommendations-com</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myNyZ5OjH2V2A_8CxhT8JHg\" target=\"_blank\">@spetzerfehn</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmvRpuSWzlyumW0TxBEvYGg\" target=\"_blank\">@angieptt</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muIMbGBGHBRBSh_vW3WaBYg\" target=\"_blank\">@wayward-timetravel-collecter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjYGTbvw43pAoujc4b09x9w\" target=\"_blank\">@rikkirikki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLRpNUWZa7qH-ulOAQGrqnA\" target=\"_blank\">@ashley17jacobs</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4yiskJOcz7k_nOLRaHq7iQ\" target=\"_blank\">@lokithedancingqueen</a> @raiprericnitertiodafo <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7rXAgLvNHsSUkb8lGnyeg\" target=\"_blank\">@wildsoul1221</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUxwWE4gjyaVLsK28-QE45Q\" target=\"_blank\">@introvertedsin</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVHoOn4Mp7db-vSptBegww\" target=\"_blank\">@robertconradjr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mG1r5oWA94EYf_LS8xLxlYA\" target=\"_blank\">@thesilverlioness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6e0nhW809mI7ErYzKY-7ag\" target=\"_blank\">@francezka10</a></p></p>",
