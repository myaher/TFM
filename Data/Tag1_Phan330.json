They have to be up early in the morning for his annual\u00a0check-up with the pediatrician, so they are having an early meal. This will be the first time he is aware of the shots he\u2019s getting, both Dan and Phil are worried about how Phoenix\u00a0will react so they haven't\u00a0told him yet.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Dan finally gets Phoenix to take his Thor shirt off and change into his pajamas, by promising he will wash it tonight so he can wear it tomorrow. Phoenix slides a velociraptor t-shirt over his head and pulls on his favorite allosaurus bottoms before running downstairs and meeting his dads in the dining room.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Phil made spaghetti with miniature meatballs, Phoenix knew that meant he was about to get conned into doing something he didn\u2019t want to do, but he didn\u2019t question it since he really loves mini meatballs.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0They finish supper and go into the lounge to watch a movie before bed like they always do and it was Phil\u2019s turn to pick the movie, he chose <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_NeverEnding_Story_%28film%29&amp;t=ZDExZjk2NDNjOWYyZTFiZTgwY2MxNzhkZWRjNWJjOGQxNDQwZWMyMyxmZTU1ZGFhZjEwNzk3ZGI5NzA1NTE1ZWE3Y2ViNzY5YjE2MTc2MTM3\" target=\"_blank\">The Neverending Story</a> since he knows it makes Phoenix so happy every time he sees the luck dragon on the screen. And it makes him sleepy which is always a good thing when they have an early morning ahead of them.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 The movie ends and Phoenix jumps up from the sofa and claps excitedly before letting out a yawn.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright bubby, its time for bed,\u201d Phil says standing up from the sofa and spreading his arms with a smile,\u00a0\u201dupsie daisy\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Phoenix\u00a0raised his arms for his dad to pick him up.\u00a0Phil lifted the 4-year old into his arms and began to carry him up the stairs to Pheonix&rsquo;s bedroom, dan following shortly behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0They all 3 enter Phoenix\u2019s room, Phil sets their son down on the floor and Dan looks at the spider-man clock hanging on the wall that reads 8:43.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDamn, that late already?\u201d Dan says in shock.</p><p>\u201cLanguage, Daniel!\u201d Phil exclaims while gesturing his head towards Phoenix.\u00a0</p><p>Dan explains \u201cwhoops! sorry dear, I'm\u00a0still getting used to not swearing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright Danny, I know you are trying\u201d smiling sweetly at his husband</p><p>\u201cAlright kiddo lets tuck you in,\u201d Dan says to Phoenix\u00a0who was climbing under his blanket.</p><p>Phoenix wiggles his body under the blanket until only his little face is poking out of the top, making both his dads giggle, they walk over to his bed. Dan sits on the floor next to it while Phil tucks in Phoenix saying\u00a0\u201csnug as a bug in a rug\u201d emphasizing every tuck. Phil gave him a kiss on the forehead, Dan then stands to do the same. they say goodnight and walk towards the door.</p><p>\u201ccan you tell me a bedtime story?\u201d Phoenix says right before they get completely out his door.</p><p>\u201cof course!\u201d Dan replies\u00a0\u201cwhat kind of story?\u201d Phil finishes</p><p>\u201cone that will make me happy!\u201d Phoenix\u00a0says with a big smile on his face</p><p>\u201cI have the perfect one,\u201d Phil says looking at dan and attempting to wink.</p><p>\u201cwell go on then,\u201d Dan says lovingly, sitting on the bean bag on their son\u2019s floor</p><p>Phil began, \u201cOnce, a really long time ago, not that far from here, there were these two guys. Dustin, and Patrick. They lived 300 miles apart, they had never met, they didn&rsquo;t even know the other existed. Until one day, one very good day, Dustin happened upon Patrick\u2019s Twitter, and thought he was really cute.\u201d Dan chuckled</p><p>\u201cSo like any smart young boy would do, he tweeted Patrick, and followed him, hoping he might be noticed. He stalked Patrick and learned everything about him, every day tweeting him more and more, hoping to be seen.&ldquo;</p><p>&quot;But what Dustin didn&rsquo;t realize was, he <i>was</i> being seen, Patrick was just very scared to reply because he also thought Dustin was very cute, and he was scared if Dustin knew the real him he wouldn&rsquo;t like him anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But finally, after 4 months of getting tweets from Dustin, Patrick finally replied. and soon replied became messages, and messages because texts, and texts became calls, and those calls moved to skype, until finally after almost 6 months, they decided to meet in person.&rdquo; Phil continued, smiling at Dan</p><p>&ldquo;Neither of them knew their feelings were mutual, but they were both okay with being just friends as long as they had the other in their life. But the day they met in person for the first time they realized, they were already more than just friends, they were <i>best</i> friends , and other the next few months they visited each other regularly, gradually growing closed, and slowly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then eventually, after almost 2 years, they moved in together. And it was thw best desition they could have made. They had a few fights, some worse than others, but they knew, in the end, they would always bounce back.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;They moved from their first house together to the second, and from the second to the third, and from the third, they moved into the fourth, and that&rsquo;s where they stay, because of no matter where they move, they know, that they are already home as long as they have each other.\u201d Phil finished as tears were welling in Dan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201care they in love daddy?\u201d Phoenix asked\u00a0with a yawn</p><p>\u201cthat's\u00a0up to you to decide sweetheart\u201d Phil answered</p><p>\u201cI think they are,\u201d Phoenix said with a smile</p><p>\u201cthen there&rsquo;s your answer,\u201d Phil said gleefully\u00a0\u201cnow time for bed\u201d</p><p>Phoenix rolled over in bed after both his dads gave him a kiss on his forehead once again. Dan and Phil walked out and slowly closed their son\u2019s door.</p><p>while walking down the hall to their room Dan says\u00a0\u201cI know they are\u201d</p><p>\u201cme too\u201d phil replied, lacing his fingers with Dan&rsquo;s</p><p><br/></p><p>This was the first to I&rsquo;ve wrote an actual fhanfic, please don&rsquo;t judge too harshly. \ud83d\udc9b</p>",
