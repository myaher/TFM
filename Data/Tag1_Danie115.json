After several years, Dan relapses and he slowly starts spiraling out of control yet again. Will he be able to get the help he needs, or will he fall victim to its vicious cycle?</p><p>Read on <i><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17758226/chapters/42550022\">Ao3</a></b></i></p><p>Read on <b><i><a href=\"https://glitterrhowell.tumblr.com/post/183076016486/chapter-3\">Wattpad</a></i></b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://\">Previous chapter </a>/ <a href=\"https://glitterrhowell.tumblr.com/post/183542988756/chapter-5\">Next chapter</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://glitterrhowell.tumblr.com/tagged/Makaylas%20writing\">Chapter Master list</a></b></p><!-- more --><p>Dan groaned as he looked at the number on the scale. He\u2019d gained half a stone in the last few weeks. He put his hands on his stomach and shook the pudge that sat there. He shut his eyes trying not to cry; how could he have let this happen? Yeah, he had eaten bad a few times the last few weeks but surely it hadn\u2019t been enough to make that much of a difference. But there is was; the proof was right in front of him.</p><p>Cheeks burning with embarrassment, he made a promise to himself that he would get on track right away and he would lose that half a stone. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to become any more disgusting than he already was.</p><p>The next few days were awful as he started out with skipping several of his meals in hopes of dropping the weight fast. But when that became apparent that wasn\u2019t something he could maintain he went to just skipping his breakfast and eating a light lunch and small dinner. But still, food was literally the only thing he thought about. The first thought when he woke up in the morning and the last when he went to sleep. It had gotten to the point his brain was so fucking exhausted from thinking about food and fighting the cravings that he\u2019d taken to just sleeping most of the time.</p><p>He knows Phil had noticed something was up as he had tried talking to him about it. Dan may have not on purpose, but had bitten his head off when he\u2019d had tried asking what was wrong. Ever since then Phil had been keeping his distance and been giving Dan his space. Which Dan had been grateful for as he really didn\u2019t feel attractive or worthy of Phil or his love at the moment.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Dan groaned as he rolled over, pulling the blankets closer around him. He had no idea what time it was but he had no intentions of getting up. The hunger pains had been particularly bad all day and he hadn\u2019t been able to focus on the video he had been trying to edit. They\u2019d been so bad in fact, that he\u2019d almost broke and went to the kitchen and made himself something to eat, but he just couldn\u2019t and so instead, he\u2019d told Phil he\u2019d had a headache and went to lay down.</p><p>His stomach gave another loud rumble and he grimaced and held it in annoyance. He reached over to the bedside table and grabbed his bottle of water. He took several big swigs and waited for them to reach his stomach and hoped that would help the hunger pains.</p><p>He\u2019d read on a fasting website that he had been on that water was an excellent way to beat the hunger pains and so far it seemed to be helping some.</p><p>Dan shoved his head back into the pillow and put the water bottle back and instead grabbed his phone.

But still, food was literally the only thing he thought about. The first thought when he woke up in the morning and the last when he went to sleep. It had gotten to the point his brain was so fucking exhausted from thinking about food and fighting the cravings that he&rsquo;d taken to just sleeping most of the time.</p><p>He knows Phil had noticed something was up as he had tried talking to him about it. Dan may have not on purpose, but had bitten his head off when he&rsquo;d had tried asking what was wrong. Ever since then Phil had been keeping his distance and been giving Dan his space. Which Dan had been grateful for as he really didn&rsquo;t feel attractive or worthy of Phil or his love at the moment.</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Dan groaned as he rolled over, pulling the blankets closer around him. He had no idea what time it was but he had no intentions of getting up. The hunger pains had been particularly bad all day and he hadn&rsquo;t been able to focus on the video he had been trying to edit. They&rsquo;d been so bad in fact, that he&rsquo;d almost broke and went to the kitchen and made himself something to eat, but he just couldn&rsquo;t and so instead, he&rsquo;d told Phil he&rsquo;d had a headache and went to lay down.</p><p>His stomach gave another loud rumble and he grimaced and held it in annoyance. He reached over to the bedside table and grabbed his bottle of water. He took several big swigs and waited for them to reach his stomach and hoped that would help the hunger pains.</p><p>He&rsquo;d read on a fasting website that he had been on that water was an excellent way to beat the hunger pains and so far it seemed to be helping some.</p><p>Dan shoved his head back into the pillow and put the water bottle back and instead grabbed his phone. He brought up the app he had downloaded that told him when his fasting period was over and he groaned, still another 15 minutes.</p><p>He had found this lifestyle choice people like to do where people fast for sixteen hours a day and only eat eight hours out of the day. With his crazy sleep schedule, it had been difficult to make it work but he had. The process was supposed to help you not eat as much or something, and you didn&rsquo;t have to count calories or something, only Dan still counted calories because he was a fat cow and he needed to.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door before it opened and Phil popped his head inside; &ldquo;You up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.=,&rdquo; he yawned, curling himself into a ball like a cat.</p><p>Phil giggled, sitting down on the bed next to him. &ldquo;I ordered Chinese for dinner if you&rsquo;re hungry.&rdquo;</p><p>The smile fell from Dan&rsquo;s face as he remembered his app.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Phil asked, clearly confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Dan smiled.</p><p>He could eat something when the app said he could for another fifteen minutes. He hadn&rsquo;t really eaten anything else all day; it would be fine.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, the food should be in ten minutes,&rdquo; Phil said leaning down kissing his head.</p><p>Dan giggled and pushed him, &ldquo;Go on and wait for the food, I don&rsquo;t want cold fried rice.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Dan moaned as he laid down on the sofa, head in Phil&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have eaten so much,&rdquo; Phil said, laughing at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t eat that much,&rdquo; he protested.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan you had two plates of fried rice, two egg rolls and at least half of my low mein. And don&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t see you eat that biscuit before dinner as well. Someone must have been hungry,&rdquo; he teased.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s face reddened with embarrassment and the subject was left with that but the rest of the night Dan fought the guilt and couldn&rsquo;t help but feel disgusted with himself.</p><p>By the time midnight rolled around, they&rsquo;d watch two movies and Dan was pretty tired and Phil looked like he was about to just fall asleep right there on the couch.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, why don&rsquo;t you go get ready for bed? I&rsquo;ll be there in a minute; I&rsquo;m just going to go get a drink of water, ok?&rdquo; Dan said, stretching his long limbs above his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm alright,&rdquo; Phil yawned standing up and heading towards the bedroom.</p><p>Dan made his way into the kitchen and picked up a glass and filled it with water. He slowly slipped the liquid eyes falling on some bananas sitting on the counter. In no way was he hungry - in fact, he was still overly stuff from dinner - but the thought of feeling the rush and the content and happy feeling that food gave him won out and he shoved his glass of water to the side and in no time the bunch of bananas became a pile of banana peels.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s brain rushed but it wasn&rsquo;t the same rush as when he ate cookies or the other stuff but it was still pleasant. His stomach hurt quite a lot but it didn&rsquo;t overrule the happiness his brain was currently feeling.</p><p>Even in his daze, he knew he needed to clean up and get to bed so he cleaned up and made his way to the bedroom. The light was already turned off and Phil was already in bed by the time he got there. He slipped in next to him and Phil turned around to spoon him.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought maybe Tumblr had consumed you,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, just really thirsty.&rdquo; he giggled, snuggling closer to Phil.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight Dan,&rdquo; Phil said, snaking his legs around his.</p><p>&ldquo;Night Philly,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>He was already beginning to hate himself.</p><p>And he promised himself this was the absolute last time. He&rsquo;d get back on track if it was the last thing he did.</p>",
