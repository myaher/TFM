Here I\u2019d like to share with you my thoughts on some of the key moments in the episode. I will mainly focus on the state of warfare, my interpretation of the main players\u2019 motivations and concerns, and my view on whether their decisions (based on the set of information each one has in hand) are good for the realm. Always keep in mind that beside Family-Duty-Honour, the running theme since the beginning of the series has always been anti-war.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b8f94cd9c067fb13d04d859d8cc8892/tumblr_n7mqge6uos1tuwbfjo1_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><h2>1. Fact: The Stark-Targaryen alliance is not in good shape for another warfare</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1872\" data-orig-height=\"882\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fc61a24cc3f68307221942bb31e459c/tumblr_inline_pr5hr0cU961v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1872\" data-orig-height=\"882\"/></figure><p>The episode starts with the aftermath of the Long Night. Tens of thousand died. The survivors are all wounded, drained out and devastated. Let\u2019s do some maths to compare the Stark-Dany\u2019s force to that of Cersei-Euron\u2019s at the moment.</p><ul><li>Stark-Dany: Before the battle against the Dead, the North and Vale had 20.000 soldiers. Dany had around 40.000 Dothrak, 8.000 Unsullied (maybe less, since she lost quite a number of them in Meereen and during the attack to Casterly Rock), the remaining of Yara\u2019s force and 2 dragons. In total, they had around 70.000 soldiers and 2 dragons. After the battle, the size of the alliance shrinks massively. Half of the Unsullied are gone and so are the Northmen, so I assume the same survival ratio applies to the Vale and Dothraki. Thus, altogether they have around 25.000- 30.000 soldiers left and 2 dragons, however all in bad shape.\u00a0<br/></li><li>Cersei-Euron: the remaining of the Lannister army, the Iron Fleet (at full strength), 20.000 sellswords from the Golden Company. So I assume they have more or less the same number of soldiers as Stark-Dany alliance. Well-rested, well-armed, well-positioned for defense behind the high walls of KL, and fully-equipped with balistas to counter the dragons.\u00a0</li></ul><p>I will discuss the rational strategy for each side in later part. For now, we clearly see that any wise leader must understand this is not the time to wage another war. Best thing to do now is giving everyone a rest to recover from the battle fatigue before starting a new campaign. (Or not to actively wage another war at all. But if they really have to, first give the soldiers a break.)</p><h2>2. The King\u2019s speech</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"288\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6dca1e301cfeef5a528a1b01c1ca20ec/tumblr_inline_pr6jjolsQl1wq1zgo_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"288\"/></figure><p>As usual, Jon delivered his iconic\u00a0\u201ccoming together\u201d speech. Despite giving away his crown, he is still the true commander-in-chief. By the way, where was Dany? The Queen is not really familiar with\u00a0\u201csetting aside differences to fight and die together so that others might live\u201d, hers are more about\u00a0\u201cwill you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbend the knee or die\u201d. So Jon took the job, and he did it well.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>It is our duty and honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath.</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Highlight: This war for the survival of mankind is a war worth fighting and dying for, because it ensures hope and a surviving chance for the future generations. (But the coming war for the Throne might not because it sacrifices lives for power.) Note that Sansa was always in the background during this part of Jon\u2019s speech. \u00a0&ndash;&gt; Hint: They might very well be the ones that pass on these memories of the heroes who died fighting to the living to the future generations. They will have children and grandchildren of their own, perhaps?</p><h2>3. Dany legitimizing Gendry as a way to exert her power</h2><p>The next scene was the banquet, where Dany legitimized Gendry to everyone\u2019s surprise. There was tension in the Hall with several <a href=\"https://gendry-aryas.tumblr.com/post/184684346982\">reaction shots</a> before Dany finally revealed her offer to make him Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm\u2019s End.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ace456dd890a38190a8295cbc45eec7/tumblr_pr2jvueXRY1qeb7qjo1_r1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"225\"/></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0<a href=\"http://gendry-aryas.tumblr.com/post/184684346982\">gendry-aryas</a></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1844\" data-orig-height=\"930\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f72b01dfef02bfb18ef14cfe22893e1/tumblr_inline_pr5hwc2fSL1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1844\" data-orig-height=\"930\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Tyrion: And a Lord of Storm\u2019s End who will be forever loyal to you.\u00a0</p><p>Dany: See? You\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s clever.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Was Dany trying to gain an ally? Not necessarily. Gendry does not have yet any bannermen or wealth, so he is not of immediate use to her. What Dany wanted to show people was, she was a powerful Queen who was to fear, but <b>she could grant mercy as she wished and make or break a Lord in just seconds</b>. Pay attention to her word choice. She first highlighted to Gendry his father\u2019s crimes to her family and herself to make him scared:\u00a0\u201cYou are aware he took my family\u2019s throne and tried to have me murdered?\u201d. Then she showed everyone that she could be merciful if she wanted to, and she could grant one title and wealth at her will,\u00a0\u201cYou are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm\u2019s End,\u00a0the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. <b>Because that is what I have made you.</b>\u201d\u00a0</p><p>If Dany really wanted to reward Gendry because of his contribution in the war, she would have highlighted the fact that he fought bravely and he was a great blacksmith who forged the weapons to fight the Dead, so he deserved this. No. She didn\u2019t talk about his contribution at all. <b>She made it clear to everyone, he became a Lord because she wanted to.\u00a0</b></p><p>People in the background chanted: That\u2019s easy, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>If the Queen could easily do everything at her will, <b>she could make a Lord and give wealth to him in seconds, then she can strip away titles and wealth in seconds too</b>. What is more interesting was the exchanging look between Tyrion and Sansa thereafter, both did not seem to be excited with the Queen\u2019s generousity at all. They both knew that the relationship between the Queen and the Lady of Winterfell was strained and tried to figure out what kind of underlying message Dany wanted to convey.\u00a0</p><p>My interpretation: The Queen was sending a \u201cfair warning\u201d to the Lady of Winterfell. See how easily I reward Gendry, a bastard son of the man who stole the Throne from my family? You\u2019d better behave, or I can strip you off your title and land as easily as I make a Lord out of him.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"448\" data-orig-height=\"315\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b231d08f02e5a2df61beda7924db6d21/tumblr_inline_pr7ikmG8Kb1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"448\" data-orig-height=\"315\"/></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0<a href=\"http://allons-ymrholmes.tumblr.com/post/184714729372\">allons-ymrholmes</a></p><p>So very probably, <b>Dany wanted to warn Sansa that the Queen could strip away her land and title at ease</b>. But if she intends to do so, who would she grant Winterfell to? The possible candidates are Bran (the only living trueborn son of Ned) and Jon (the supposed bastard, if he stays silent about his parentage). Some of you might think that this is a very Tywinesque move that Dany could never think of. But I think this is very possible. Otherwise, Sansa and Tyrion would not have exchanged that suspicious look.</p><p>Both Tyrion and Sansa were aware of Dany\u2019s possible hidden agenda.\u00a0Tyrion then did a bit of reality check with Bran. He was always curious about the crippled boy and his adventure, and now he wanted to test what the boy wanted. He praised Bran\u2019s extensive knowledge and said that it would be useful as Lord of Winterfell. Arghh, but Sansa is currently the Lady of Winterfell, why did Tyrion give hint to Bran that he was the only trueborn son of Ned Stark and should be the Lord of Winterfell? I think <b>Tyrion was trying to figure out the power dynamic within the Stark family and what each of them might want. </b>Do they want power, or do they want something else? Bran made it clear to Tyrion that he didn\u2019t really want to be the Lord of Winterfell anymore. (Maybe he did when he was a kid, but now he doesn\u2019t.) Tyrion didn\u2019t know about Jon\u2019s parentage yet, so to his knowledge the contenders for Winterfell are only Jon and Sansa. <b>In Tyrion\u2019s eyes, Jon is clearly in Dany\u2019s favor since he is her lover.</b>\u00a0If Dany legitimizes Jon and gives Winterfell to him, Sansa would be empty-handed. To certain extent, Tyrion cares for Sansa\u2019s well-being, that\u2019s why he approached Sansa and raised his concerns to her before he left.</p><p>- to be continued -</p>",

Arghh, but Sansa is currently the Lady of Winterfell, why did Tyrion give hint to Bran that he was the only trueborn son of Ned Stark and should be the Lord of Winterfell? I think <b>Tyrion was trying to figure out the power dynamic within the Stark family and what each of them might want. </b>Do they want power, or do they want something else? Bran made it clear to Tyrion that he didn\u2019t really want to be the Lord of Winterfell anymore. (Maybe he did when he was a kid, but now he doesn\u2019t.) Tyrion didn\u2019t know about Jon\u2019s parentage yet, so to his knowledge the contenders for Winterfell are only Jon and Sansa. <b>In Tyrion\u2019s eyes, Jon is clearly in Dany\u2019s favor since he is her lover.</b>\u00a0If Dany legitimizes Jon and gives Winterfell to him, Sansa would be empty-handed. To certain extent, Tyrion cares for Sansa\u2019s well-being, that\u2019s why he approached Sansa and raised his concerns to her before he left.</p><p>- to be continued -</p>",

Here I\u2019d like to share with you my thoughts on some of the key moments in the episode. I will mainly focus on the state of warfare, my interpretation of the main players\u2019 motivations and concerns, and my view on whether their decisions (based on the set of information each one has in hand) are good for the realm. Always keep in mind that beside Family-Duty-Honour, the running theme since the beginning of the series has always been anti-war.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b8f94cd9c067fb13d04d859d8cc8892/tumblr_n7mqge6uos1tuwbfjo1_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><h2>1. Fact: The Stark-Targaryen alliance is not in good shape for another warfare</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"1872\" data-orig-height=\"882\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fc61a24cc3f68307221942bb31e459c/tumblr_inline_pr5hr0cU961v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1872\" data-orig-height=\"882\"></figure><p>The episode starts with the aftermath of the Long Night. Tens of thousand died. The survivors are all wounded, drained out and devastated. Let\u2019s do some maths to compare the Stark-Dany\u2019s force to that of Cersei-Euron\u2019s at the moment.</p><ul><li>Stark-Dany: Before the battle against the Dead, the North and Vale had 20.000 soldiers. Dany had around 40.000 Dothrak, 8.000 Unsullied (maybe less, since she lost quite a number of them in Meereen and during the attack to Casterly Rock), the remaining of Yara\u2019s force and 2 dragons. In total, they had around 70.000 soldiers and 2 dragons. After the battle, the size of the alliance shrinks massively. Half of the Unsullied are gone and so are the Northmen, so I assume the same survival ratio applies to the Vale and Dothraki. Thus, altogether they have around 25.000- 30.000 soldiers left and 2 dragons, however all in bad shape.\u00a0<br></li><li>Cersei-Euron: the remaining of the Lannister army, the Iron Fleet (at full strength), 20.000 sellswords from the Golden Company. So I assume they have more or less the same number of soldiers as Stark-Dany alliance. Well-rested, well-armed, well-positioned for defense behind the high walls of KL, and fully-equipped with balistas to counter the dragons.\u00a0</li></ul><p>I will discuss the rational strategy for each side in later part. For now, we clearly see that any wise leader must understand this is not the time to wage another war. Best thing to do now is giving everyone a rest to recover from the battle fatigue before starting a new campaign. (Or not to actively wage another war at all. But if they really have to, first give the soldiers a break.)</p><h2>2. The King\u2019s speech</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"288\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6dca1e301cfeef5a528a1b01c1ca20ec/tumblr_inline_pr6jjolsQl1wq1zgo_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"288\"></figure><p>As usual, Jon delivered his iconic\u00a0\u201ccoming together\u201d speech. Despite giving away his crown, he is still the true commander-in-chief. By the way, where was Dany? The Queen is not really familiar with\u00a0\u201csetting aside differences to fight and die together so that others might live\u201d, hers are more about\u00a0\u201cwill you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbend the knee or die\u201d.

Dany legitimizing Gendry as a way to exert her power</h2><p>The next scene was the banquet, where Dany legitimized Gendry to everyone\u2019s surprise. There was tension in the Hall with several <a href=\"https://gendry-aryas.tumblr.com/post/184684346982\">reaction shots</a> before Dany finally revealed her offer to make him Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm\u2019s End.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5ace456dd890a38190a8295cbc45eec7/tumblr_pr2jvueXRY1qeb7qjo1_r1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"225\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0<a href=\"http://gendry-aryas.tumblr.com/post/184684346982\">gendry-aryas</a></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1844\" data-orig-height=\"930\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f72b01dfef02bfb18ef14cfe22893e1/tumblr_inline_pr5hwc2fSL1v86ltz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1844\" data-orig-height=\"930\"></figure><blockquote><p>Tyrion: And a Lord of Storm\u2019s End who will be forever loyal to you.\u00a0</p><p>Dany: See?

What Dany wanted to show people was, she was a powerful Queen who was to fear, but <b>she could grant mercy as she wished and make or break a Lord in just seconds</b>. Pay attention to her word choice. She first highlighted to Gendry his father\u2019s crimes to her family and herself to make him scared:\u00a0\u201cYou are aware he took my family\u2019s throne and tried to have me murdered?\u201d.

What is more interesting was the exchanging look between Tyrion and Sansa thereafter, both did not seem to be excited with the Queen\u2019s generousity at all. They both knew that the relationship between the Queen and the Lady of Winterfell was strained and tried to figure out what kind of underlying message Dany wanted to convey.\u00a0</p><p>My interpretation: The Queen was sending a \u201cfair warning\u201d to the Lady of Winterfell.

She has been killed but is now an Undead. She looks like a living person thanks to a charm made by Sansa but her true appearance is the one of a corpse and she is mute due to her throat being slit. Catelyn cannot die again unless she is burnt or decapitated and thus is not afraid to put herself in danger for her family. Since she is a descendant of powerful witches, she is the reason her children and herself have powers.</p><h2>Robb Stark \u2013 The War Spirit</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a842e9a8bdaca047390383e096b576/tumblr_pr7klvL1Cv1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Robb Stark is the first son of Ned and Catelyn. After his father&rsquo;s murder, he becomes mad with grief and fury. He gets lost in the Northern Woods where he is found by War Spirits who make him one of their own to allow him to get his revenge. He is the most prone to violence in the family and can lash out easily. He is also over protective of his family. As a War Spirit, Robb can summon a full armour, a horse and a sword to slay his enemies.</p><h2>Sansa Stark \u2013 The Witch</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/853c6a0327fd7f69ae8971809107d87f/tumblr_pr7kloc3qN1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Sansa Stark is the second child of Ned and Catelyn. After her father&rsquo;s death, her witch powers awaken. She is easily one of the most powerful members of the Stark and is behind Catelyn&rsquo;s charm and Bran&rsquo;s survival after he is attacked. She is the first to see her father&rsquo;s ghost. Sansa&rsquo;s powers includes the creation of charms, telekinesis and the creation of illusions. Blood and bones can make her magic stronger but she refuses to use them and she uses runes and crystals as vessels.</p><h2>Arya Stark \u2013 The Vampire</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a9adbc5832d5a10e3fd4549c36e5cf1/tumblr_pr7klxtRjj1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>After her father&rsquo;s death, Arya Stark runs away from home and is found by Jaqen, a vampire who attacks her. She survives thanks to Robb&rsquo;s intervention and her witch heritage and becomes a vampire. Stronger and faster than human, she is prone to mood swings for a while because of bloodlust but leans to control it. She wants to avenge her father and protect her family more than anything. Arya&rsquo;s closest sibling was Jon and she is heartbroken when he joins the Order.</p><h2>Bran Stark \u2013 The Druid</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fca2fbb9fa4cf11b5b3ac422faa781f0/tumblr_pr7klt9MIZ1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Bran Stark is the fourth child of Catelyn and Ned. His Druid powers allow him to control animals and to have visions. His powers awoke after his father&rsquo;s death, just like Sansa&rsquo;s, and they grew closer after. He is attacked by Jaime Lannister a few months later and is crippled as a result. This attack was the official beginning of the war between the Lannisters and the Starks.</p><h2>Rickon Stark \u2013 The Werewolf</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d1873841822be132c031e57c9657c0/tumblr_pr7klmDO9L1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Last child of Ned and Catelyn, Rickon is a young boy who is turned into a werewolf after being attacked in the woods. He was following Robb, worried for his brother.

Catelyn cannot die again unless she is burnt or decapitated and thus is not afraid to put herself in danger for her family. Since she is a descendant of powerful witches, she is the reason her children and herself have powers.</p><h2>Robb Stark \u2013 The War Spirit</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a842e9a8bdaca047390383e096b576/tumblr_pr7klvL1Cv1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Robb Stark is the first son of Ned and Catelyn. After his father\u2019s murder, he becomes mad with grief and fury. He gets lost in the Northern Woods where he is found by War Spirits who make him one of their own to allow him to get his revenge. He is the most prone to violence in the family and can lash out easily. He is also over protective of his family. As a War Spirit, Robb can summon a full armour, a horse and a sword to slay his enemies.</p><h2>Sansa Stark \u2013 The Witch</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/853c6a0327fd7f69ae8971809107d87f/tumblr_pr7kloc3qN1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Sansa Stark is the second child of Ned and Catelyn.

She is the first to see her father\u2019s ghost. Sansa\u2019s powers includes the creation of charms, telekinesis and the creation of illusions.

She survives thanks to Robb\u2019s intervention and her witch heritage and becomes a vampire. Stronger and faster than human, she is prone to mood swings for a while because of bloodlust but leans to control it. She wants to avenge her father and protect her family more than anything. Arya\u2019s closest sibling was Jon and she is heartbroken when he joins the Order.</p><h2>Bran Stark \u2013 The Druid</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fca2fbb9fa4cf11b5b3ac422faa781f0/tumblr_pr7klt9MIZ1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"></figure><p>Bran Stark is the fourth child of Catelyn and Ned.
