I recently saw Louis, it was like going back in time, he showed me his album and we had a great time. He&rsquo;s doing great! I feel proud of how he has been managing everything with his life and all his experience. He takes care of his family and he&rsquo;s doing okay. It&rsquo;d be amazing to grow separately and then make a reunion. Imagine a concert with all of our songs. It&rsquo;d be amazing if we could do that! I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t do that in the future.",

He reckons it\u2019s happened a few times since he\u2019s met her.</p><p>When y/n, literally, stumbled into Harry\u2019s life she was midway through university, studying sociology and psychology (and yes she\u2019s tested Harry\u2019s personality against her lecture notes. He\u2019s a type two: the caring, interpersonal type \u2013 demonstrative, generous, people-pleasing, and possessive). Around this time is when he had first fallen in love with her. Their relationship was under wraps, no one knew but them. They liked it that way, maybe Harry a little more. He felt like he had her all to himself like he could get to know her in his own time.</p><p>See, how they would meet was Harry would wait until her dorm was officially closed to guests at night, and then he\u2019d just sneak in. She\u2019d given him an extra fob to get on the hall, and after shooting a quick here text, she would prop the suite door open for him. He would slip in, toeing his shoes off in the hall first, and make a beeline for her room before any of her suitemates could wake up.</p><p>On this one particular night, if he remembers correctly it was a Wednesday, when he stepped into the room she had the lights dimmed, dollar store candles lit, and a plate of minute microwave noodles accompanied by two glasses of orange squash. Harry remembers the shine in her eyes and the smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cWanted to get some takeout, but I didn\u2019t have enough for everyone in the suite and I didn\u2019t want to be that person, you know? So, like, I tried making some alfredo, chicken of course, but I burnt it. Still not sure how that happened, so, yeah.\u201d She took a breath and smiled up at Harry. He felt his heart stomp in his chest. \u201cJust know you\u2019ve been busy lately so I want this to be your place to relax. Even if it\u2019s just a little twin bed in the corner of Williams\u2019 all-girls hall.\u201d</p><p>And since then, she\u2019d just continued to amaze him. When he turned twenty-four she got him a bouquet of pink roses and a spiral bound book with How To Fall in Love with Harry Styles sharpied on the cover. Inside was a note.</p><p>Harry,</p><p>When I met you, I was convinced you weren\u2019t real. People like you don\u2019t exist for people like me. But yet, you\u2019re all mine. I don\u2019t know much about love or soulmates, but I know that right now you are my everything, and I am so grateful. You\u2019ve been around for twenty-four years today. I\u2019m so lucky that I got to spend one of those years with you. To many more. And to you. Enjoy.</p><p>With all the love I can offer,</p><p>Y/n</p><p>Chapter 1: Get ready for smoothies, juice cleanses, Higgs and ridiculous amounts of yoga.</p><p>The smile on his face was embarrassingly large for the rest of the day. And every centimetre was for her.</p><p>Y/n is something Harry still can\u2019t believe is real. Harry didn\u2019t always believe that there was someone for everyone, himself included, but he was wrong. He was so wrong. Y/n is that one person who was so unusual to the natural order of things; who is his one exception.</p><p>Every time he looks at her all he can wonder is how far had she travelled. Years? Thousands of years? Lifetimes? All just to end up with him.</p><p>Once their relationship hit the press, Harry was certain it was all going to end. Though they never confirmed their relationship via social media, it was very obvious that they were a couple. Because of this, y/n had to pull out of in-classroom lectures and settle for online, which ended up putting her behind in her curriculum. Then came the harassment and stalking. Once people found out her dormitory, she had to move off campus. And unfortunately, so did her suitemates, as they were getting harassed for details of the couple as well. Harry thought the final straw was when she had to delete all forms of social media. Death threats, attacks, and abuse followed her everywhere, under every tweet, and under every Instagram post.</p><p>He sat her down one evening. They were at his place in London because, well, she hadn\u2019t bought a flat and there was nowhere else for her to go, so. They were about to go out for dinner and Harry just knew that paparazzi were going to be hounding over him, especially since this is the first time he\u2019s been out mid-tour break. He wanted to lay it down thick, give her a clean way out so she didn\u2019t have to feel guilty or forced in any way.</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s nearly half eight.\u201d He sighs, and she nods knowingly. In a hushed tone, she says, \u201cis it your tummy again? I\u2019ll cancel the reservation, we don\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>Harry rubs his forehead gently, shutting his eyes. \u201cNo, y/n&hellip;I just&hellip;\u201c</p><p>She sends him a smile. \u201cH, everyone gets an upset belly. And you know I won\u2019t judge you. Now come on. I\u2019ll get the electric blanket and turn on Forrest Gump.\u201d When she turns to leave the front room, Harry grips her arm a bit tighter to get her attention. She looks at him, a bit bewildered, before taking a seat again. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Harry thinks, at that moment, her eyes are the most beautiful they\u2019ve ever been. Filled with wonder, longing, and fondness. He wants to savour that look because he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019ll get it forever.</p><p>\u201cThis is your out.\u201d He says it after a deep breath and with what y/n recognised as his this-is-very-serious voice. \u201cOut of me. Out of us. You\u2019ve got nothing but\u2013but shit since media found out, and all because of me. Don\u2019t let me and my life ruin yours. So, there. This is your out. I won\u2019t be mad at all. I won\u2019t mention you in interviews or press. I won\u2019t even contact you if that\u2019s really what you want.\u201d His hand drags through his hair, tangling it further. He hasn\u2019t looked at her yet, he\u2019s afraid to. \u201cI love you, y/n, and if it takes you leaving then&hellip;then okay.\u201d</p><p>She grips his hands before nudging his head up to hers. She\u2019s got a smile on her face and water in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d is what she says. Harry can nearly feel his lungs collapsing and he can nearly hear the crack dividing his heart in two.</p><p>He nods. \u201cWell, I suppose\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201c\u2013but no thank you.\u201d The confusion on his face makes her giggle. \u201cI\u2019m far too in love with you Harry, it\u2019s going to take more than a few cameramen and aggressive women to push me out of your life.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019s beaming again.</p><p>So now, after a year and a half of dating, Harry had decided that he was going to marry her. It was simple really. He couldn\u2019t possibly count the number of times a day he thinks of her. Or how many times he\u2019s dreamed of her. Or how many times he\u2019s seen her face and thought wow, that girl is all mine.</p><p>He went to his mum first. She, of course, cried. Big, fat, ugly, but very happy, tears. Her baby boy was getting married. Goodness. Then there was Gemma, who was more than pleased. Since she had met y/n she\u2019d fallen in love with her too. It was impossible to not love her.</p><p>Telling her family was fairly easy as well. Sure, in the early days of their relationship her parents were a bit skeptical of them being together, Harry to be more specific. To be frank, they thought he was a bit too much for her. But they came around to the idea of having him around and might have even fallen for his charm as well. \u00a0</p><p>All that was left to do now was ask.</p><p>The ring he\u2019d gotten was a combination of their two favouritecolours. His, champagne and hers, emerald. The ring was emerald cut with white diamonds around the gem. It was her, it screamed her. It would be a pity to not have it adorning her fourth finger on her left hand.</p><p>He chose the 5th of May to ask for her hand in marriage. It was the sunniest of days in London, his back garden had been freshly cut a couple of days ago, and the groceries were just delivered. She was out getting petrol in Harry\u2019s Range Rover. When he came home she surprised him with a five-day getaway to Chewton Glen\u2019s Treehouse Hotel and Spa. Because they were leaving so early she\u2019d thought it would be a good idea to fill up now. While she was gone Harry cut fruit, made sandwiches, made a pitcher of squash, and mixed a greek salad. He wanted this whole thing to be perfect. He wanted her to brag about this for the rest of their lives together.</p><p>He grabbed the softest blanket and the basket he\u2019d whipped up and set up an area in the back of the garden, under some trees. The ring was burning a hole in his trousers.</p><p>She came back and stood on their deck with the cutest of grins on her face. Her bounce down the garden was quick, unlike the kiss she\u2019d given him once close enough. \u201cAll this for me? What for?\u201d</p><p>Harry pushes some hair from her face, tucking it gently behind her ear with the rest. Her face nuzzles into his palm and he could nearly burst. \u201cJus\u2019 cause I love you.\u201d</p><p>Lunch was amazing. They spoke about songs Harry had written, papers y/n had written, and then they moved to stranger topics. Like, what ifs. What if the earth just opened up and decided to eat us? Or what if you got locked in an elevator for five hours? He had his head on her lap. She was gently massaging his face, sometimes straining her back so she could kiss him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but what if I turned into Shrek twice a month for an entire day?\u201d She chuckles at her own question. Harry rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d just have to be your Fiona.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his cheeks, making him open his eyes to her. She was leaning over him slightly, her hair framing her face, and her head blocking the harsh sun from his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d go ugly forever for me?\u201d</p><p>He barks out a contagious, boisterous laugh. \u201cI\u2019d flip the world upside down for you.\u201d She kissed him. Soft and sweet. Just how she is. Harry cleared his throat. \u201cWhat if I asked you to marry me?\u201d</p><p>Her movements stopped and Harry felt her body tense a little. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Harry rocks up on one knee, sliding the ring from his pocket. Her hands fly up to her mouth and Harry chuckles nervously, a heat spreading over his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you there were over 100 billion stars in the sky, and not one of them shines as bright as you? Or what if I told you there were poems and songs that could make me cry, but none of them could ever move me like you do? And what if I told you that all I ever want to do is love you and be yours for the rest of our lives?\u201d She\u2019s wiping tears from her eyes hastily. \u201cY/n, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>A loud sob racks through her body and Harry smiles, sniffling lightly along with her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she mumbles, wiping her eyes even though the tears kept coming.</p><p>Harry chuckles and grabs her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He pulls her hand closer, pushing the ring towards her finger.</p><p>Suddenly, she yanks it back, and that\u2019s when the air starts to get cold. London\u2019s sunny May 5th quickly became a chilling Antarctic winter.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She walks away.</p><p>Now Harry is left wondering where he went wrong.</p>",

London\u2019s sunny May 5th quickly became a chilling Antarctic winter.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She walks away.</p><p>Now Harry is left wondering where he went wrong.</p></p>",

He reckons it\u2019s happened a few times since he\u2019s met her.</p><p>When y/n, literally, stumbled into Harry\u2019s life she was midway through university, studying sociology and psychology (and yes she\u2019s tested Harry\u2019s personality against her lecture notes. He\u2019s a type two: the caring, interpersonal type \u2013 demonstrative, generous, people-pleasing, and possessive). Around this time is when he had first fallen in love with her. Their relationship was under wraps, no one knew but them. They liked it that way, maybe Harry a little more. He felt like he had her all to himself like he could get to know her in his own time.</p><p>See, how they would meet was Harry would wait until her dorm was officially closed to guests at night, and then he\u2019d just sneak in. She\u2019d given him an extra fob to get on the hall, and after shooting a quick here text, she would prop the suite door open for him. He would slip in, toeing his shoes off in the hall first, and make a beeline for her room before any of her suitemates could wake up.</p><p>On this one particular night, if he remembers correctly it was a Wednesday, when he stepped into the room she had the lights dimmed, dollar store candles lit, and a plate of minute microwave noodles accompanied by two glasses of orange squash. Harry remembers the shine in her eyes and the smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cWanted to get some takeout, but I didn\u2019t have enough for everyone in the suite and I didn\u2019t want to be that person, you know? So, like, I tried making some alfredo, chicken of course, but I burnt it. Still not sure how that happened, so, yeah.\u201d She took a breath and smiled up at Harry. He felt his heart stomp in his chest. \u201cJust know you\u2019ve been busy lately so I want this to be your place to relax. Even if it\u2019s just a little twin bed in the corner of Williams\u2019 all-girls hall.\u201d</p><p>And since then, she\u2019d just continued to amaze him. When he turned twenty-four she got him a bouquet of pink roses and a spiral bound book with How To Fall in Love with Harry Styles sharpied on the cover. Inside was a note.</p><p>Harry,</p><p>When I met you, I was convinced you weren\u2019t real. People like you don\u2019t exist for people like me. But yet, you\u2019re all mine. I don\u2019t know much about love or soulmates, but I know that right now you are my everything, and I am so grateful. You\u2019ve been around for twenty-four years today. I\u2019m so lucky that I got to spend one of those years with you. To many more. And to you. Enjoy.</p><p>With all the love I can offer,</p><p>Y/n</p><p>Chapter 1: Get ready for smoothies, juice cleanses, Higgs and ridiculous amounts of yoga.</p><p>The smile on his face was embarrassingly large for the rest of the day. And every centimetre was for her.</p><p>Y/n is something Harry still can\u2019t believe is real. Harry didn\u2019t always believe that there was someone for everyone, himself included, but he was wrong. He was so wrong. Y/n is that one person who was so unusual to the natural order of things; who is his one exception.</p><p>Every time he looks at her all he can wonder is how far had she travelled. Years? Thousands of years? Lifetimes? All just to end up with him.</p><p>Once their relationship hit the press, Harry was certain it was all going to end. Though they never confirmed their relationship via social media, it was very obvious that they were a couple. Because of this, y/n had to pull out of in-classroom lectures and settle for online, which ended up putting her behind in her curriculum. Then came the harassment and stalking. Once people found out her dormitory, she had to move off campus. And unfortunately, so did her suitemates, as they were getting harassed for details of the couple as well. Harry thought the final straw was when she had to delete all forms of social media. Death threats, attacks, and abuse followed her everywhere, under every tweet, and under every Instagram post.</p><p>He sat her down one evening. They were at his place in London because, well, she hadn\u2019t bought a flat and there was nowhere else for her to go, so. They were about to go out for dinner and Harry just knew that paparazzi were going to be hounding over him, especially since this is the first time he\u2019s been out mid-tour break. He wanted to lay it down thick, give her a clean way out so she didn\u2019t have to feel guilty or forced in any way.</p><p>\u201cHarry, it\u2019s nearly half eight.\u201d He sighs, and she nods knowingly. In a hushed tone, she says, \u201cis it your tummy again? I\u2019ll cancel the reservation, we don\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>Harry rubs his forehead gently, shutting his eyes. \u201cNo, y/n\u2026I just\u2026\u201c</p><p>She sends him a smile. \u201cH, everyone gets an upset belly. And you know I won\u2019t judge you. Now come on. I\u2019ll get the electric blanket and turn on Forrest Gump.\u201d When she turns to leave the front room, Harry grips her arm a bit tighter to get her attention. She looks at him, a bit bewildered, before taking a seat again. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Harry thinks, at that moment, her eyes are the most beautiful they\u2019ve ever been. Filled with wonder, longing, and fondness. He wants to savour that look because he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019ll get it forever.</p><p>\u201cThis is your out.\u201d He says it after a deep breath and with what y/n recognised as his this-is-very-serious voice. \u201cOut of me. Out of us. You\u2019ve got nothing but\u2013but shit since media found out, and all because of me. Don\u2019t let me and my life ruin yours. So, there. This is your out. I won\u2019t be mad at all. I won\u2019t mention you in interviews or press. I won\u2019t even contact you if that\u2019s really what you want.\u201d His hand drags through his hair, tangling it further. He hasn\u2019t looked at her yet, he\u2019s afraid to. \u201cI love you, y/n, and if it takes you leaving then\u2026then okay.\u201d</p><p>She grips his hands before nudging his head up to hers. She\u2019s got a smile on her face and water in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d is what she says. Harry can nearly feel his lungs collapsing and he can nearly hear the crack dividing his heart in two.</p><p>He nods. \u201cWell, I suppose\u2013\u201c</p><p>\u201c\u2013but no thank you.\u201d The confusion on his face makes her giggle. \u201cI\u2019m far too in love with you Harry, it\u2019s going to take more than a few cameramen and aggressive women to push me out of your life.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019s beaming again.</p><p>So now, after a year and a half of dating, Harry had decided that he was going to marry her. It was simple really. He couldn\u2019t possibly count the number of times a day he thinks of her. Or how many times he\u2019s dreamed of her. Or how many times he\u2019s seen her face and thought wow, that girl is all mine.</p><p>He went to his mum first. She, of course, cried. Big, fat, ugly, but very happy, tears. Her baby boy was getting married. Goodness. Then there was Gemma, who was more than pleased. Since she had met y/n she\u2019d fallen in love with her too. It was impossible to not love her.</p><p>Telling her family was fairly easy as well. Sure, in the early days of their relationship her parents were a bit skeptical of them being together, Harry to be more specific. To be frank, they thought he was a bit too much for her. But they came around to the idea of having him around and might have even fallen for his charm as well. \u00a0</p><p>All that was left to do now was ask.</p><p>The ring he\u2019d gotten was a combination of their two favouritecolours. His, champagne and hers, emerald. The ring was emerald cut with white diamonds around the gem. It was her, it screamed her. It would be a pity to not have it adorning her fourth finger on her left hand.</p><p>He chose the 5th of May to ask for her hand in marriage. It was the sunniest of days in London, his back garden had been freshly cut a couple of days ago, and the groceries were just delivered. She was out getting petrol in Harry\u2019s Range Rover. When he came home she surprised him with a five-day getaway to Chewton Glen\u2019s Treehouse Hotel and Spa. Because they were leaving so early she\u2019d thought it would be a good idea to fill up now. While she was gone Harry cut fruit, made sandwiches, made a pitcher of squash, and mixed a greek salad. He wanted this whole thing to be perfect. He wanted her to brag about this for the rest of their lives together.</p><p>He grabbed the softest blanket and the basket he\u2019d whipped up and set up an area in the back of the garden, under some trees. The ring was burning a hole in his trousers.</p><p>She came back and stood on their deck with the cutest of grins on her face. Her bounce down the garden was quick, unlike the kiss she\u2019d given him once close enough. \u201cAll this for me? What for?\u201d</p><p>Harry pushes some hair from her face, tucking it gently behind her ear with the rest. Her face nuzzles into his palm and he could nearly burst. \u201cJus\u2019 cause I love you.\u201d</p><p>Lunch was amazing. They spoke about songs Harry had written, papers y/n had written, and then they moved to stranger topics. Like, what ifs. What if the earth just opened up and decided to eat us? Or what if you got locked in an elevator for five hours? He had his head on her lap. She was gently massaging his face, sometimes straining her back so she could kiss him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but what if I turned into Shrek twice a month for an entire day?\u201d She chuckles at her own question. Harry rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d just have to be your Fiona.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his cheeks, making him open his eyes to her. She was leaning over him slightly, her hair framing her face, and her head blocking the harsh sun from his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d go ugly forever for me?\u201d</p><p>He barks out a contagious, boisterous laugh. \u201cI\u2019d flip the world upside down for you.\u201d She kissed him. Soft and sweet. Just how she is. Harry cleared his throat. \u201cWhat if I asked you to marry me?\u201d</p><p>Her movements stopped and Harry felt her body tense a little. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Harry rocks up on one knee, sliding the ring from his pocket. Her hands fly up to her mouth and Harry chuckles nervously, a heat spreading over his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you there were over 100 billion stars in the sky, and not one of them shines as bright as you? Or what if I told you there were poems and songs that could make me cry, but none of them could ever move me like you do? And what if I told you that all I ever want to do is love you and be yours for the rest of our lives?\u201d She\u2019s wiping tears from her eyes hastily. \u201cY/n, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>A loud sob racks through her body and Harry smiles, sniffling lightly along with her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she mumbles, wiping her eyes even though the tears kept coming.</p><p>Harry chuckles and grabs her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He pulls her hand closer, pushing the ring towards her finger.</p><p>Suddenly, she yanks it back, and that\u2019s when the air starts to get cold. London\u2019s sunny May 5th quickly became a chilling Antarctic winter.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She walks away.</p><p>Now Harry is left wondering where he went wrong.</p></p>",

They spoke about songs Harry had written, papers y/n had written, and then they moved to stranger topics. Like, what ifs. What if the earth just opened up and decided to eat us? Or what if you got locked in an elevator for five hours? He had his head on her lap. She was gently massaging his face, sometimes straining her back so she could kiss him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but what if I turned into Shrek twice a month for an entire day?&rdquo; She chuckles at her own question. Harry rolls his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d just have to be your Fiona.&rdquo;</p><p>She squeezed his cheeks, making him open his eyes to her. She was leaning over him slightly, her hair framing her face, and her head blocking the harsh sun from his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d go ugly forever for me?&rdquo;</p><p>He barks out a contagious, boisterous laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d flip the world upside down for you.&rdquo; She kissed him. Soft and sweet. Just how she is. Harry cleared his throat. &ldquo;What if I asked you to marry me?&rdquo;</p><p>Her movements stopped and Harry felt her body tense a little. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry rocks up on one knee, sliding the ring from his pocket. Her hands fly up to her mouth and Harry chuckles nervously, a heat spreading over his cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;What if I told you there were over 100 billion stars in the sky, and not one of them shines as bright as you? Or what if I told you there were poems and songs that could make me cry, but none of them could ever move me like you do? And what if I told you that all I ever want to do is love you and be yours for the rest of our lives?&rdquo; She&rsquo;s wiping tears from her eyes hastily. &ldquo;Y/n, will you marry me?&rdquo;</p><p>A loud sob racks through her body and Harry smiles, sniffling lightly along with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she mumbles, wiping her eyes even though the tears kept coming.</p><p>Harry chuckles and grabs her hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; He pulls her hand closer, pushing the ring towards her finger.</p><p>Suddenly, she yanks it back, and that&rsquo;s when the air starts to get cold. London&rsquo;s sunny May 5th quickly became a chilling Antarctic winter.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; She walks away.</p><p>Now Harry is left wondering where he went wrong.</p></p>",
