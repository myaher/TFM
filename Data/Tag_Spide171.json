Thank you so much for all the love and support!</p><p><a href=\"https://bellero.tumblr.com/post/181788203379/the-parker-twins-prologue\">Prologue</a> -\u00a0</p><hr><p>You were stood on the sidewalk slightly bouncing up and down. Peter was finally coming back from his \u2018retreat\u2019 to Germany, he had text you saying he was almost home, that happened to be ten minutes ago. You were now freezing cold and grouchy, you went to pull out your phone to text your brother when a black car pulled up. You let out a grin, you waved at Happy who had gone to the trunk to get your brothers things, you skipped over and helped him haul the suit and Peter\u2019s duffel bag out onto the sidewalk, he gave you a small smile and a nod.</p><p>Tony and Peter jumped when you yanked open the door and sat down in the front passenger seat, \u201cgod, not you again\u201d Tony grumbled under his breath causing you to glare at him \u201ccan\u2019t say I\u2019m too happy to see you either\u201d you snapped back before turning your gaze towards your brother who was looking between you both with an amused glint in his eyes, \u201canyway, when\u2019s out next \u2018retreat\u2019, you know?\u201d he asked, you smirked slightly at his excited demeanour, Tony paused for a while, \u201cwe\u2019ll call you\u201d he answered with a small shrug, \u201cdo you have my number?\u201d he asked, you snickered at his confused expression which caused him to glare at you. Tony shook his head at the young boy \u201cno, I mean, we\u2019ll call you. Like, someone will call you\u201d he explained gesturing with his hands, Peter nodded his head. Tony leant across Peter and pulled on the door handle. You muffled your laugh when you watched Peter awkwardly wrap his arms around the older man \u201cit\u2019s not a hug\u201d he pulled out of Peter\u2019s awkward embrace, \u201cI\u2019m just grabbing the door for you\u201d you laughed at Peter\u2019s flustered face as he climbed out of the car, he ducked down and looked at you, \u201cyou coming?\u201d he asked, you nodded your head and told him you\u2019d catch up, he shrugged and closed the door leaving you and Tony in silence.</p><p>He leant back and straightened his legs out as much as he could and crossed his arms, \u201ccan I help you with something?\u201d he asked, you turned around in the seat and crossed your legs, \u201cdid he get hurt?\u201d you asked. Tony was thrown back at your question, \u201cwhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d he furrowed his eyebrows and leant forward \u201cI mean did Peter get hurt?\u201d you asked again shuffling in the seat slightly to get comfortable. Tony paused for a short while, he noticed your playing with your fingers. You were also extremely fidgety. He let out a sigh \u201che got hurt, but it wasn\u2019t bad\u2026 okay? I wouldn\u2019t have let anything bad happen to him\u201d you nodded your head and cleared your throat, \u201cokay\u2026\u201d you suddenly perked up \u201cwas Thor there?\u201d you asked with wide, excited eyes. Tony chuckled and shook his head, \u201cunfortunately the God of thunder couldn\u2019t grace us with his presence\u201d his response caused you to laugh, \u201cthanks for looking out for my brother\u201d you smiled, he nodded his head.</p><p>You pushed the door open with a heave and stepped out of the car, you quickly ducked back down \u201calso, you should really talk to SHIELD about updating their firewall\u2026 hacking into their system is child\u2019s play\u201d Tony smiled and shook his head \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell them that\u201d you yelled goodbye as you slammed the door shut, you waved at the car and watched as it sped of down the street, twirling around you walked back into your apartment complex.</p><hr><p>You were walking down the hallway of your school, an extra skip in your step and a grin on your face. You were clutching a piece of paper in your right hand whilst you craned your neck to find Ned and Peter. You spotted them walking down the hallway away from you so you ran after them, you could faintly hear Ned\u2019s voice \u201che\u2019d be all, &ldquo;Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here\u2019s a gold coin.&rdquo; I don\u2019t know how jobs work\u201d you let out a laugh and jumped at them, you swung an arm around each of their shoulders and shoved yourself in the middle,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s exactly how they work. Also, guess who finally got an\u00a0\u2018A\u2019 in algebra\u201d you bragged waving the paper around, Peter took it out of your hand and laughed before pulling you into a side hug\u00a0\u201cthe look on Mr. Williams\u2019 face was great, ugh I hate that guy\u201d you grumbled before taking the paper back from Peter, you looked over to Ned and saw the little figurine in his hand a narrowed your eyes in confusion, you cocked your head to the side\u00a0\u201cNed&hellip; why\u2019re you carrying around a Lego figurine?\u201d you asked, he quickly lit up and started telling you about the new Lego Death Star he had,\u00a0\u201canyway, I\u2019ll knock out the bones of the Death Star at my place. Then I\u2019ll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops\u201d he further explained,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019d be great. Y/n, you wanna help?\u201d Peter asked, you sucked in a breath between your teeth\u00a0\u201cI would but I don\u2019t want to\u201d you said causing the two boys to let out a laugh and shake their heads,\u00a0\u201canyway I gotta get to class, see you at lunch!\u201d you called behind you whilst you walked away.<br/></p><p>You were sat next to Peter and Ned in the Cafeteria, you reached over and grabbed Peter\u2019s cookie before breaking it in half, leaving the one half for yourself. \u201cDid Liz get a new top?\u201d you heard your brother ask his friend, you paused and looked at them\u00a0\u201cno. We\u2019ve seen that before, but never with that skirt\u201d you rolled your eyes and scoffed at Ned\u2019s reply, you continued to eat your food.\u00a0\u201cWe should probably stop staring before it gets creepy though\u201d your head snapped up at your brother,\u00a0\u201ctoo late.

What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?\u201d Liz asked, Charles beat you and rung the bell \u201cHydrogen\u2019s the lightest. That\u2019s not the question. Okay. Yeah\u201d you snickered slightly causing him to glare at you, you turned to Abraham who rung the bell\u00a0\u201cUranium\u201d he spoke, you high fived him when Liz told him it was correct. You rolled your eyes when you heard Flash speak\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019ve never even been in the same room as Tony Stark\u201d he snickered,\u00a0\u201cwait, what\u2019s happening?\u201d one of the girls asked, somebody explained that Peter wasn\u2019t going to Washington,\u00a0\u201cwait what?

Just very observant.\u201d She spoke quickly causing you to laugh quietly,\u00a0\u201cFlash, you\u2019re in for Peter\u201d Liz said which made you let out a groan and hit your head on the desk,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up\u201d he sarcastically spoke, you looked at him\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can vouch for Black Widow herself when I say she\u2019d never go out with a greasy little shithead\u201d you deadpanned, you heard the class snicker quietly.\u00a0</p><p>You were chasing your brother who was walking outside of the school, you quickly caught up with him and grabbed his shoulder,\u00a0\u201cPeter! What\u2019d you mean you\u2019re not coming to Washington?\u201d you asked, he rolled his eyes at your annoyed tone,\u00a0\u201cI need to be here in case Mister Stark needs me\u201d he explained, you narrowed your eyes\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can take a weekend off&hellip; C\u2019mon, Pete. You\u2019re really gonna leave me alone with Flash?\u201d you groaned, he laughed and shook his head before jumping the school gate, he turned to you\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d he yelled before running off, you let out a sigh and started walking to your apartment.</p><p>You and Ned were sat on Peter\u2019s bed, you had almost completed the Death Star. You froze when you heard the window open, you looked at Ned with wide eyes\u00a0\u2018<i>please tell me he took off the suit</i>\u2019 you thought in your head. You turned to where Ned was staring. Peter was crawling on the ceiling, he closed the door quietly using his webs he jumped down and let out a sigh before turning around and freezing at the site of Ned. You jumped when he dropped the Death Star,\u00a0\u201cdude! we spent ages on that!\u201d you whined, Ned completely ignored you and continued to gape at Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Spider-Man. From YouTube\u201d he stuttered out, Peter quickly took off the suit causing you to cover your eyes\u00a0\u201cew\u201d you mumbled, Peter shook his head\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not\u201d he sounded panicked.</p><p>\u201cPeter, he literally saw you crawling on the ceiling with the suit on\u201d you said with a slight laugh, you could feel him glare at you\u00a0\u201cNed, what\u2019re you doing in my room?\u201d he asked, you rolled your eyes. Of course he forgot. Ned explained that May had let him in,\u00a0\u201cyou said we were gonna finish the Death Star\u201d he said. Peter was about to say something when May walked in \u201cthat turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let\u2019s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?\u201d May asked, Ned nodded his head but Peter interrupted before he could say anything,\u00a0\u201cno! He\u2019s got a thing\u201d he said quickly, May nodded her head and left the room closing the door behind her.\u00a0\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d Ned asked, Peter shook his head whilst he pulled on a jumper,\u00a0\u201cnobody knows! Well, Y/n and Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that\u2019s it!\u201d He explained.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony Stark made you that!? Are you an Avenger?\u201d Ned asked excitedly, Peter shrugged his shoulders but grinned \u201cyeah, basically.\u201d You snorted a laugh and shook your head, he glared at you before turning back to Ned, \u201cyou can\u2019t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret\u201d he begged, him and Ned were now by the door.</p><p>Ned narrowed his eyes,\u00a0\u201ca secret? Why?\u201d he asked, Peter let out a groan of annoyance\u00a0\u201cyou know what she\u2019s like\u201d he motioned outside the room,\u00a0\u201cif she finds out people try and kill me every night, she\u2019s not gonna let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, Please?\u201d He sounded desperate at this point, you understood why. May was fiercely protective over the both of you, if anything happened to either one of you she\u2019d rip New York apart.\u00a0\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll level with you,\u201d Ned paused for a few seconds,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I can keep this a secret\u201d you groaned and flopped down onto the bed,\u00a0\u201cthis is the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, Peter!\u201d he yelled, you quickly stood up and shushed him before walking over to them,\u00a0\u201cNed, May cannot know. We cannot do that to her right now\u201d you spoke harshly, Ned looked between the both of you and Peter let out a sigh\u00a0\u201cI mean, everything that\u2019s happened with her&hellip; please\u201d he begged.\u00a0</p><p>Ned let out a sigh,\u00a0\u201cokay, I promise I won\u2019t tell anyone\u201d you both let out a sigh of relief,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening right now\u201d Peter mumbled under his breath. It was silent for a few seconds before Ned spoke up\u00a0\u201ccan I try the suit on?\u201d he asked practically bouncing up and down. You let out a short laugh and shook your head, Peter shook his head\u00a0\u2018no\u2019. Ned was halfway out the door before he paused and looked at Peter,\u00a0\u201chow do you do this and the Stark internship?\u201d he asked, you and Peter looked at each other before turning back to him\u00a0\u201cthis is the Stark internship. Just get out of here\u201d and with that Peter shut the door.\u00a0</p><hr><h2>The Parker Twins Tags-</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPCkPOJRpdMOgxRSMrqOtLg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPCkPOJRpdMOgxRSMrqOtLg\">@winchesters-favorite-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUYxTpsjIiFo0UJSXlcz3fw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUYxTpsjIiFo0UJSXlcz3fw\">@mersuperwholocked-lowlife</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDCDMMuD0I1O2too18GQD9w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDCDMMuD0I1O2too18GQD9w\">@daughters-and-winsisters</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgN7BD0OGUwSZ3x2Vxly24w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgN7BD0OGUwSZ3x2Vxly24w\">@just4muggles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTaa3sEz3M0XAcnAMGshSjQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTaa3sEz3M0XAcnAMGshSjQ\">@humanexile</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJEc0GDunHclJS0-cY4_u0A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJEc0GDunHclJS0-cY4_u0A\">@family-business-one-shots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7TqF73gsPiieM7xZ4vI4sg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7TqF73gsPiieM7xZ4vI4sg\">@rosegoldquintis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md-qJfZRxsv7rc_rUBNz8EQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md-qJfZRxsv7rc_rUBNz8EQ\">@sassy-specter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOm5u1T5FrYUbbzXN0rA5ew\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOm5u1T5FrYUbbzXN0rA5ew\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOm5u1T5FrYUbbzXN0rA5ew\">@unicorn-sparkles123</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwgsP5lB4aGR3JLHde9Xvkg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwgsP5lB4aGR3JLHde9Xvkg\">@saturn-aka-six</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4e65AEVhTwspcaCEoMcTdQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4e65AEVhTwspcaCEoMcTdQ\">@octo-cow52</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXXw0GrflaR4cnDkFbJ1phw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXXw0GrflaR4cnDkFbJ1phw\">@thegirlwholikestomanythings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNUuHSCaBq_RNg03vlqZi9w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNUuHSCaBq_RNg03vlqZi9w\">@zeusmyster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meY3r_zFzQbFmsoTwpmPKKw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meY3r_zFzQbFmsoTwpmPKKw\">@6gotosleep9</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHTlmAK0olqO77Xq0StAkpg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHTlmAK0olqO77Xq0StAkpg\">@miyaint</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7xKyvvTWDZrOPw013-AAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7xKyvvTWDZrOPw013-AAw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7xKyvvTWDZrOPw013-AAw\">@grimzszs</a> @sara29392 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmAx6899EKweXC6waQUKYQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmAx6899EKweXC6waQUKYQ\">@deansdeliciouspies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTQEfrqvMjRkm7ZPjbS7e2w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTQEfrqvMjRkm7ZPjbS7e2w\">@emwinchester1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\">@lizlil</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJuQVUndL6boUOny7KWXU9g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJuQVUndL6boUOny7KWXU9g\">@antiscocialfanwarrior</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbI53PSmd4Kitvjmoc8OcQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbI53PSmd4Kitvjmoc8OcQ\">@anothershorthuman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9QIVPzaWYR92N-kdMnmS4g\"></a><a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9QIVPzaWYR92N-kdMnmS4g\">@mellilla-rose</a>\u200b <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a>\u200b <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmMxwuz4_3Xt3rDoy_fWk7Q\">@ixchel-9275</a>\u200b @ficnalunaus <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrV6L6gfJc1kpeTIdz-c4_Q\">@steve-rogcrs</a>\u200b <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL3-jeOTrAnhSDRCmpJGSqw\">@floral-marauders</a>\u200b</p>",

Thank you so much for all the love and support!</p><p><a href=\"https://bellero.tumblr.com/post/181788203379/the-parker-twins-prologue\">Prologue</a> -\u00a0</p><hr><p>You were stood on the sidewalk slightly bouncing up and down. Peter was finally coming back from his \u2018retreat\u2019 to Germany, he had text you saying he was almost home, that happened to be ten minutes ago. You were now freezing cold and grouchy, you went to pull out your phone to text your brother when a black car pulled up. You let out a grin, you waved at Happy who had gone to the trunk to get your brothers things, you skipped over and helped him haul the suit and Peter\u2019s duffel bag out onto the sidewalk, he gave you a small smile and a nod.</p><p>Tony and Peter jumped when you yanked open the door and sat down in the front passenger seat, \u201cgod, not you again\u201d Tony grumbled under his breath causing you to glare at him \u201ccan\u2019t say I\u2019m too happy to see you either\u201d you snapped back before turning your gaze towards your brother who was looking between you both with an amused glint in his eyes, \u201canyway, when\u2019s out next \u2018retreat\u2019, you know?\u201d he asked, you smirked slightly at his excited demeanour, Tony paused for a while, \u201cwe\u2019ll call you\u201d he answered with a small shrug, \u201cdo you have my number?\u201d he asked, you snickered at his confused expression which caused him to glare at you. Tony shook his head at the young boy \u201cno, I mean, we\u2019ll call you. Like, someone will call you\u201d he explained gesturing with his hands, Peter nodded his head. Tony leant across Peter and pulled on the door handle. You muffled your laugh when you watched Peter awkwardly wrap his arms around the older man \u201cit\u2019s not a hug\u201d he pulled out of Peter\u2019s awkward embrace, \u201cI\u2019m just grabbing the door for you\u201d you laughed at Peter\u2019s flustered face as he climbed out of the car, he ducked down and looked at you, \u201cyou coming?\u201d he asked, you nodded your head and told him you\u2019d catch up, he shrugged and closed the door leaving you and Tony in silence.</p><p>He leant back and straightened his legs out as much as he could and crossed his arms, \u201ccan I help you with something?\u201d he asked, you turned around in the seat and crossed your legs, \u201cdid he get hurt?\u201d you asked. Tony was thrown back at your question, \u201cwhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d he furrowed his eyebrows and leant forward \u201cI mean did Peter get hurt?\u201d you asked again shuffling in the seat slightly to get comfortable. Tony paused for a short while, he noticed your playing with your fingers. You were also extremely fidgety. He let out a sigh \u201che got hurt, but it wasn\u2019t bad\u2026 okay? I wouldn\u2019t have let anything bad happen to him\u201d you nodded your head and cleared your throat, \u201cokay\u2026\u201d you suddenly perked up \u201cwas Thor there?\u201d you asked with wide, excited eyes. Tony chuckled and shook his head, \u201cunfortunately the God of thunder couldn\u2019t grace us with his presence\u201d his response caused you to laugh, \u201cthanks for looking out for my brother\u201d you smiled, he nodded his head.</p><p>You pushed the door open with a heave and stepped out of the car, you quickly ducked back down \u201calso, you should really talk to SHIELD about updating their firewall\u2026 hacking into their system is child\u2019s play\u201d Tony smiled and shook his head \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell them that\u201d you yelled goodbye as you slammed the door shut, you waved at the car and watched as it sped of down the street, twirling around you walked back into your apartment complex.</p><hr><p>You were walking down the hallway of your school, an extra skip in your step and a grin on your face. You were clutching a piece of paper in your right hand whilst you craned your neck to find Ned and Peter. You spotted them walking down the hallway away from you so you ran after them, you could faintly hear Ned\u2019s voice \u201che\u2019d be all, \u201cGood job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here\u2019s a gold coin.\u201d I don\u2019t know how jobs work\u201d you let out a laugh and jumped at them, you swung an arm around each of their shoulders and shoved yourself in the middle,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s exactly how they work. Also, guess who finally got an\u00a0\u2018A\u2019 in algebra\u201d you bragged waving the paper around, Peter took it out of your hand and laughed before pulling you into a side hug\u00a0\u201cthe look on Mr. Williams\u2019 face was great, ugh I hate that guy\u201d you grumbled before taking the paper back from Peter, you looked over to Ned and saw the little figurine in his hand a narrowed your eyes in confusion, you cocked your head to the side\u00a0\u201cNed\u2026 why\u2019re you carrying around a Lego figurine?\u201d you asked, he quickly lit up and started telling you about the new Lego Death Star he had,\u00a0\u201canyway, I\u2019ll knock out the bones of the Death Star at my place. Then I\u2019ll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops\u201d he further explained,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019d be great. Y/n, you wanna help?\u201d Peter asked, you sucked in a breath between your teeth\u00a0\u201cI would but I don\u2019t want to\u201d you said causing the two boys to let out a laugh and shake their heads,\u00a0\u201canyway I gotta get to class, see you at lunch!\u201d you called behind you whilst you walked away.<br></p><p>You were sat next to Peter and Ned in the Cafeteria, you reached over and grabbed Peter\u2019s cookie before breaking it in half, leaving the one half for yourself. \u201cDid Liz get a new top?\u201d you heard your brother ask his friend, you paused and looked at them\u00a0\u201cno. We\u2019ve seen that before, but never with that skirt\u201d you rolled your eyes and scoffed at Ned\u2019s reply, you continued to eat your food.\u00a0\u201cWe should probably stop staring before it gets creepy though\u201d your head snapped up at your brother,\u00a0\u201ctoo late. You guys are losers\u201d you let out a laugh at MJ\u2019s comment\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s not wrong\u201d you muttered which made Peter and Ned glare at you.</p><p>You let out a groan when you saw Flash making his way over, he walked past\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s up, Penis Parker?\u201d he asked with a smirk, you let out what sounded like a growl and stood up, ignoring Peter\u2019s protests you marched over to Flash and tapped him on the shoulder, he turned around and looked at you with a grin plastered on his face,\u00a0\u201cyou know what, Flash? For somebody who loves to boast about how straight he is, you sure do go on about my brother\u2019s dick a lot\u2026 is there something you\u2019d like to share with everybody or?\u201d you trailed off, most of the Cafeteria were watching intently and the two of you,\u00a0\u201cwhat, Peter\u2019s too scared to fight his own battles so he had to send his little sister?\u201d he mocked, you rolled your eyes\u00a0\u201cpersonally I don\u2019t think Peter should have to waste his breath on somebody who\u2019s main goal in life is to be a contender on the Bachelor\u201d you stepped closer,\u00a0\u201cnow, do us both a favour and shut your mouth\u201d.</p><p>You stepped back and smiled at him before walking back to your table, you sat down and ignored everybody\u2019s gazes, you took a bite out of the cookie before spitting it back out into a napkin\u00a0\u201cew, who the fuck puts raisins in cookies\u201d you grunted before letting out a sigh. You turned to your brother who was just staring at you\u00a0\u201cY/n, how many times have I told you not to chew him out like that\u201d he groaned, you shrugged your shoulders\u00a0\u201csomebody has to put him in his place, and who better to do that than me\u201d you said before putting what was left of your food on the tray,\u00a0\u201csee you soon!\u201d you called behind your shoulder as you walked off.</p><p>You were sat next to Abraham whilst Liz quizzed the academic decathlon team, \u201cnext question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?\u201d Liz asked, Charles beat you and rung the bell \u201cHydrogen\u2019s the lightest. That\u2019s not the question. Okay. Yeah\u201d you snickered slightly causing him to glare at you, you turned to Abraham who rung the bell\u00a0\u201cUranium\u201d he spoke, you high fived him when Liz told him it was correct.

Just very observant.\u201d She spoke quickly causing you to laugh quietly,\u00a0\u201cFlash, you\u2019re in for Peter\u201d Liz said which made you let out a groan and hit your head on the desk,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up\u201d he sarcastically spoke, you looked at him\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can vouch for Black Widow herself when I say she\u2019d never go out with a greasy little shithead\u201d you deadpanned, you heard the class snicker quietly.\u00a0</p><p>You were chasing your brother who was walking outside of the school, you quickly caught up with him and grabbed his shoulder,\u00a0\u201cPeter! What\u2019d you mean you\u2019re not coming to Washington?\u201d you asked, he rolled his eyes at your annoyed tone,\u00a0\u201cI need to be here in case Mister Stark needs me\u201d he explained, you narrowed your eyes\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can take a weekend off\u2026 C\u2019mon, Pete. You\u2019re really gonna leave me alone with Flash?\u201d you groaned, he laughed and shook his head before jumping the school gate, he turned to you\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d he yelled before running off, you let out a sigh and started walking to your apartment.</p><p>You and Ned were sat on Peter\u2019s bed, you had almost completed the Death Star. You froze when you heard the window open, you looked at Ned with wide eyes\u00a0\u2018<i>please tell me he took off the suit</i>\u2019 you thought in your head. You turned to where Ned was staring. Peter was crawling on the ceiling, he closed the door quietly using his webs he jumped down and let out a sigh before turning around and freezing at the site of Ned. You jumped when he dropped the Death Star,\u00a0\u201cdude! we spent ages on that!\u201d you whined, Ned completely ignored you and continued to gape at Peter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Spider-Man. From YouTube\u201d he stuttered out, Peter quickly took off the suit causing you to cover your eyes\u00a0\u201cew\u201d you mumbled, Peter shook his head\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not\u201d he sounded panicked.</p><p>\u201cPeter, he literally saw you crawling on the ceiling with the suit on\u201d you said with a slight laugh, you could feel him glare at you\u00a0\u201cNed, what\u2019re you doing in my room?\u201d he asked, you rolled your eyes. Of course he forgot. Ned explained that May had let him in,\u00a0\u201cyou said we were gonna finish the Death Star\u201d he said. Peter was about to say something when May walked in \u201cthat turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let\u2019s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?\u201d May asked, Ned nodded his head but Peter interrupted before he could say anything,\u00a0\u201cno! He\u2019s got a thing\u201d he said quickly, May nodded her head and left the room closing the door behind her.\u00a0\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d Ned asked, Peter shook his head whilst he pulled on a jumper,\u00a0\u201cnobody knows! Well, Y/n and Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that\u2019s it!\u201d He explained.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony Stark made you that!? Are you an Avenger?\u201d Ned asked excitedly, Peter shrugged his shoulders but grinned \u201cyeah, basically.\u201d You snorted a laugh and shook your head, he glared at you before turning back to Ned, \u201cyou can\u2019t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret\u201d he begged, him and Ned were now by the door.</p><p>Ned narrowed his eyes,\u00a0\u201ca secret? Why?\u201d he asked, Peter let out a groan of annoyance\u00a0\u201cyou know what she\u2019s like\u201d he motioned outside the room,\u00a0\u201cif she finds out people try and kill me every night, she\u2019s not gonna let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, Please?\u201d He sounded desperate at this point, you understood why. May was fiercely protective over the both of you, if anything happened to either one of you she\u2019d rip New York apart.\u00a0\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll level with you,\u201d Ned paused for a few seconds,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I can keep this a secret\u201d you groaned and flopped down onto the bed,\u00a0\u201cthis is the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, Peter!\u201d he yelled, you quickly stood up and shushed him before walking over to them,\u00a0\u201cNed, May cannot know. We cannot do that to her right now\u201d you spoke harshly, Ned looked between the both of you and Peter let out a sigh\u00a0\u201cI mean, everything that\u2019s happened with her\u2026 please\u201d he begged.\u00a0</p><p>Ned let out a sigh,\u00a0\u201cokay, I promise I won\u2019t tell anyone\u201d you both let out a sigh of relief,\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening right now\u201d Peter mumbled under his breath. It was silent for a few seconds before Ned spoke up\u00a0\u201ccan I try the suit on?\u201d he asked practically bouncing up and down. You let out a short laugh and shook your head, Peter shook his head\u00a0\u2018no\u2019. Ned was halfway out the door before he paused and looked at Peter,\u00a0\u201chow do you do this and the Stark internship?\u201d he asked, you and Peter looked at each other before turning back to him\u00a0\u201cthis is the Stark internship. Just get out of here\u201d and with that Peter shut the door.\u00a0</p><hr><h2>The Parker Twins Tags-</h2><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPCkPOJRpdMOgxRSMrqOtLg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPCkPOJRpdMOgxRSMrqOtLg\">@winchesters-favorite-girl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUYxTpsjIiFo0UJSXlcz3fw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUYxTpsjIiFo0UJSXlcz3fw\">@mersuperwholocked-lowlife</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR_UCwARCul9gSnnNyDqpOQ\">@platonic-plots</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDCDMMuD0I1O2too18GQD9w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDCDMMuD0I1O2too18GQD9w\">@daughters-and-winsisters</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgN7BD0OGUwSZ3x2Vxly24w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgN7BD0OGUwSZ3x2Vxly24w\">@just4muggles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTaa3sEz3M0XAcnAMGshSjQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTaa3sEz3M0XAcnAMGshSjQ\">@humanexile</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJEc0GDunHclJS0-cY4_u0A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJEc0GDunHclJS0-cY4_u0A\">@family-business-one-shots</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7TqF73gsPiieM7xZ4vI4sg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7TqF73gsPiieM7xZ4vI4sg\">@rosegoldquintis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/md-qJfZRxsv7rc_rUBNz8EQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/md-qJfZRxsv7rc_rUBNz8EQ\">@sassy-specter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOm5u1T5FrYUbbzXN0rA5ew\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOm5u1T5FrYUbbzXN0rA5ew\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOm5u1T5FrYUbbzXN0rA5ew\">@unicorn-sparkles123</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwgsP5lB4aGR3JLHde9Xvkg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwgsP5lB4aGR3JLHde9Xvkg\">@saturn-aka-six</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4e65AEVhTwspcaCEoMcTdQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4e65AEVhTwspcaCEoMcTdQ\">@octo-cow52</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXXw0GrflaR4cnDkFbJ1phw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXXw0GrflaR4cnDkFbJ1phw\">@thegirlwholikestomanythings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNUuHSCaBq_RNg03vlqZi9w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNUuHSCaBq_RNg03vlqZi9w\">@zeusmyster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meY3r_zFzQbFmsoTwpmPKKw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/meY3r_zFzQbFmsoTwpmPKKw\">@6gotosleep9</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHTlmAK0olqO77Xq0StAkpg\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHTlmAK0olqO77Xq0StAkpg\">@miyaint</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7xKyvvTWDZrOPw013-AAw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7xKyvvTWDZrOPw013-AAw\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_7xKyvvTWDZrOPw013-AAw\">@grimzszs</a> @sara29392 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmAx6899EKweXC6waQUKYQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjmAx6899EKweXC6waQUKYQ\">@deansdeliciouspies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTQEfrqvMjRkm7ZPjbS7e2w\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTQEfrqvMjRkm7ZPjbS7e2w\">@emwinchester1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\">@lizlil</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJuQVUndL6boUOny7KWXU9g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJuQVUndL6boUOny7KWXU9g\">@antiscocialfanwarrior</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbI53PSmd4Kitvjmoc8OcQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbI53PSmd4Kitvjmoc8OcQ\">@anothershorthuman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9QIVPzaWYR92N-kdMnmS4g\"></a><a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9QIVPzaWYR92N-kdMnmS4g\">@mellilla-rose</a>\u200b <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAIE1bga0MiuOO7zD8AapaQ\">@paintballkid711</a>\u200b <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmMxwuz4_3Xt3rDoy_fWk7Q\">@ixchel-9275</a>\u200b @ficnalunaus <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrV6L6gfJc1kpeTIdz-c4_Q\">@steve-rogcrs</a>\u200b <a></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL3-jeOTrAnhSDRCmpJGSqw\">@floral-marauders</a>\u200b</p>",

Thank you so much for all the love and support!</p><p><a href=\"https://bellero.tumblr.com/post/181788203379/the-parker-twins-prologue\">Prologue</a> -\u00a0</p><hr><p>You were stood on the sidewalk slightly bouncing up and down. Peter was finally coming back from his \u2018retreat\u2019 to Germany, he had text you saying he was almost home, that happened to be ten minutes ago. You were now freezing cold and grouchy, you went to pull out your phone to text your brother when a black car pulled up. You let out a grin, you waved at Happy who had gone to the trunk to get your brothers things, you skipped over and helped him haul the suit and Peter\u2019s duffel bag out onto the sidewalk, he gave you a small smile and a nod.</p><p>Tony and Peter jumped when you yanked open the door and sat down in the front passenger seat, \u201cgod, not you again\u201d Tony grumbled under his breath causing you to glare at him \u201ccan\u2019t say I\u2019m too happy to see you either\u201d you snapped back before turning your gaze towards your brother who was looking between you both with an amused glint in his eyes, \u201canyway, when\u2019s out next \u2018retreat\u2019, you know?\u201d he asked, you smirked slightly at his excited demeanour, Tony paused for a while, \u201cwe\u2019ll call you\u201d he answered with a small shrug, \u201cdo you have my number?\u201d he asked, you snickered at his confused expression which caused him to glare at you. Tony shook his head at the young boy \u201cno, I mean, we\u2019ll call you. Like, someone will call you\u201d he explained gesturing with his hands, Peter nodded his head. Tony leant across Peter and pulled on the door handle. You muffled your laugh when you watched Peter awkwardly wrap his arms around the older man \u201cit\u2019s not a hug\u201d he pulled out of Peter\u2019s awkward embrace, \u201cI\u2019m just grabbing the door for you\u201d you laughed at Peter\u2019s flustered face as he climbed out of the car, he ducked down and looked at you, \u201cyou coming?\u201d he asked, you nodded your head and told him you\u2019d catch up, he shrugged and closed the door leaving you and Tony in silence.</p><p>He leant back and straightened his legs out as much as he could and crossed his arms, \u201ccan I help you with something?\u201d he asked, you turned around in the seat and crossed your legs, \u201cdid he get hurt?\u201d you asked. Tony was thrown back at your question, \u201cwhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d he furrowed his eyebrows and leant forward \u201cI mean did Peter get hurt?\u201d you asked again shuffling in the seat slightly to get comfortable. Tony paused for a short while, he noticed your playing with your fingers. You were also extremely fidgety. He let out a sigh \u201che got hurt, but it wasn\u2019t bad\u2026 okay? I wouldn\u2019t have let anything bad happen to him\u201d you nodded your head and cleared your throat, \u201cokay\u2026\u201d you suddenly perked up \u201cwas Thor there?\u201d you asked with wide, excited eyes. Tony chuckled and shook his head, \u201cunfortunately the God of thunder couldn\u2019t grace us with his presence\u201d his response caused you to laugh, \u201cthanks for looking out for my brother\u201d you smiled, he nodded his head.</p><p>You pushed the door open with a heave and stepped out of the car, you quickly ducked back down \u201calso, you should really talk to SHIELD about updating their firewall\u2026 hacking into their system is child\u2019s play\u201d Tony smiled and shook his head \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell them that\u201d you yelled goodbye as you slammed the door shut, you waved at the car and watched as it sped of down the street, twirling around you walked back into your apartment complex.</p><hr><p>You were walking down the hallway of your school, an extra skip in your step and a grin on your face. You were clutching a piece of paper in your right hand whilst you craned your neck to find Ned and Peter. You spotted them walking down the hallway away from you so you ran after them, you could faintly hear Ned\u2019s voice \u201che\u2019d be all, \u201cGood job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here\u2019s a gold coin.\u201d I don\u2019t know how jobs work\u201d you let out a laugh and jumped at them, you swung an arm around each of their shoulders and shoved yourself in the middle,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019s exactly how they work. Also, guess who finally got an\u00a0\u2018A\u2019 in algebra\u201d you bragged waving the paper around, Peter took it out of your hand and laughed before pulling you into a side hug\u00a0\u201cthe look on Mr. Williams\u2019 face was great, ugh I hate that guy\u201d you grumbled before taking the paper back from Peter, you looked over to Ned and saw the little figurine in his hand a narrowed your eyes in confusion, you cocked your head to the side\u00a0\u201cNed\u2026 why\u2019re you carrying around a Lego figurine?\u201d you asked, he quickly lit up and started telling you about the new Lego Death Star he had,\u00a0\u201canyway, I\u2019ll knock out the bones of the Death Star at my place. Then I\u2019ll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops\u201d he further explained,\u00a0\u201cthat\u2019d be great. Y/n, you wanna help?\u201d Peter asked, you sucked in a breath between your teeth\u00a0\u201cI would but I don\u2019t want to\u201d you said causing the two boys to let out a laugh and shake their heads,\u00a0\u201canyway I gotta get to class, see you at lunch!\u201d you called behind you whilst you walked away.<br></p><p>You were sat next to Peter and Ned in the Cafeteria, you reached over and grabbed Peter\u2019s cookie before breaking it in half, leaving the one half for yourself. \u201cDid Liz get a new top?\u201d you heard your brother ask his friend, you paused and looked at them\u00a0\u201cno. We\u2019ve seen that before, but never with that skirt\u201d you rolled your eyes and scoffed at Ned\u2019s reply, you continued to eat your food.\u00a0\u201cWe should probably stop staring before it gets creepy though\u201d your head snapped up at your brother,\u00a0\u201ctoo late. You guys are losers\u201d you let out a laugh at MJ\u2019s comment\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s not wrong\u201d you muttered which made Peter and Ned glare at you.</p><p>You let out a groan when you saw Flash making his way over, he walked past\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s up, Penis Parker?\u201d he asked with a smirk, you let out what sounded like a growl and stood up, ignoring Peter\u2019s protests you marched over to Flash and tapped him on the shoulder, he turned around and looked at you with a grin plastered on his face,\u00a0\u201cyou know what, Flash? For somebody who loves to boast about how straight he is, you sure do go on about my brother\u2019s dick a lot\u2026 is there something you\u2019d like to share with everybody or?\u201d you trailed off, most of the Cafeteria were watching intently and the two of you,\u00a0\u201cwhat, Peter\u2019s too scared to fight his own battles so he had to send his little sister?\u201d he mocked, you rolled your eyes\u00a0\u201cpersonally I don\u2019t think Peter should have to waste his breath on somebody who\u2019s main goal in life is to be a contender on the Bachelor\u201d you stepped closer,\u00a0\u201cnow, do us both a favour and shut your mouth\u201d.</p><p>You stepped back and smiled at him before walking back to your table, you sat down and ignored everybody\u2019s gazes, you took a bite out of the cookie before spitting it back out into a napkin\u00a0\u201cew, who the fuck puts raisins in cookies\u201d you grunted before letting out a sigh. You turned to your brother who was just staring at you\u00a0\u201cY/n, how many times have I told you not to chew him out like that\u201d he groaned, you shrugged your shoulders\u00a0\u201csomebody has to put him in his place, and who better to do that than me\u201d you said before putting what was left of your food on the tray,\u00a0\u201csee you soon!\u201d you called behind your shoulder as you walked off.</p><p>You were sat next to Abraham whilst Liz quizzed the academic decathlon team, \u201cnext question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?\u201d Liz asked, Charles beat you and rung the bell \u201cHydrogen\u2019s the lightest. That\u2019s not the question. Okay. Yeah\u201d you snickered slightly causing him to glare at you, you turned to Abraham who rung the bell\u00a0\u201cUranium\u201d he spoke, you high fived him when Liz told him it was correct.

                "content": "<p>\n\nSummary- This is just a re-imagined version of Homecoming but Peter has a twin sister.\n\n<br /></p><p>Warnings- swearing, bullying.</p><p>NOTE- the response to the prologue was so overwhelming and completely unexpected. Thank you so much for all the love and support!</p><p><a href=\"https://bellero.tumblr.com/post/181788203379/the-parker-twins-prologue\">Prologue</a> -&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>You were stood on the sidewalk slightly bouncing up and down. Peter was finally coming back from his &lsquo;retreat&rsquo; to Germany, he had text you saying he was almost home, that happened to be ten minutes ago. You were now freezing cold and grouchy, you went to pull out your phone to text your brother when a black car pulled up. You let out a grin, you waved at Happy who had gone to the trunk to get your brothers things, you skipped over and helped him haul the suit and Peter&rsquo;s duffel bag out onto the sidewalk, he gave you a small smile and a nod.</p><p>Tony and Peter jumped when you yanked open the door and sat down in the front passenger seat, &ldquo;god, not you again&rdquo; Tony grumbled under his breath causing you to glare at him &ldquo;can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m too happy to see you either&rdquo; you snapped back before turning your gaze towards your brother who was looking between you both with an amused glint in his eyes, &ldquo;anyway, when&rsquo;s out next &lsquo;retreat&rsquo;, you know?&rdquo; he asked, you smirked slightly at his excited demeanour, Tony paused for a while, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll call you&rdquo; he answered with a small shrug, &ldquo;do you have my number?&rdquo; he asked, you snickered at his confused expression which caused him to glare at you. Tony shook his head at the young boy &ldquo;no, I mean, we&rsquo;ll call you. Like, someone will call you&rdquo; he explained gesturing with his hands, Peter nodded his head. Tony leant across Peter and pulled on the door handle. You muffled your laugh when you watched Peter awkwardly wrap his arms around the older man &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a hug&rdquo; he pulled out of Peter&rsquo;s awkward embrace, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just grabbing the door for you&rdquo; you laughed at Peter&rsquo;s flustered face as he climbed out of the car, he ducked down and looked at you, &ldquo;you coming?&rdquo; he asked, you nodded your head and told him you&rsquo;d catch up, he shrugged and closed the door leaving you and Tony in silence.</p><p>He leant back and straightened his legs out as much as he could and crossed his arms, &ldquo;can I help you with something?&rdquo; he asked, you turned around in the seat and crossed your legs, &ldquo;did he get hurt?&rdquo; you asked. Tony was thrown back at your question, &ldquo;what&rsquo;d you mean?&rdquo; he furrowed his eyebrows and leant forward &ldquo;I mean did Peter get hurt?&rdquo; you asked again shuffling in the seat slightly to get comfortable. Tony paused for a short while, he noticed your playing with your fingers. You were also extremely fidgety. He let out a sigh &ldquo;he got hurt, but it wasn&rsquo;t bad&hellip; okay? I wouldn&rsquo;t have let anything bad happen to him&rdquo; you nodded your head and cleared your throat, &ldquo;okay&hellip;&rdquo; you suddenly perked up &ldquo;was Thor there?&rdquo; you asked with wide, excited eyes. Tony chuckled and shook his head, &ldquo;unfortunately the God of thunder couldn&rsquo;t grace us with his presence&rdquo; his response caused you to laugh, &ldquo;thanks for looking out for my brother&rdquo; you smiled, he nodded his head.</p><p>You pushed the door open with a heave and stepped out of the car, you quickly ducked back down &ldquo;also, you should really talk to SHIELD about updating their firewall&hellip; hacking into their system is child&rsquo;s play&rdquo; Tony smiled and shook his head &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to tell them that&rdquo; you yelled goodbye as you slammed the door shut, you waved at the car and watched as it sped of down the street, twirling around you walked back into your apartment complex.</p><hr /><p>You were walking down the hallway of your school, an extra skip in your step and a grin on your face. You were clutching a piece of paper in your right hand whilst you craned your neck to find Ned and Peter. You spotted them walking down the hallway away from you so you ran after them, you could faintly hear Ned&rsquo;s voice &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be all, &ldquo;Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here&rsquo;s a gold coin.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know how jobs work&rdquo; you let out a laugh and jumped at them, you swung an arm around each of their shoulders and shoved yourself in the middle,&nbsp;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s exactly how they work. Also, guess who finally got an&nbsp;&lsquo;A&rsquo; in algebra&rdquo; you bragged waving the paper around, Peter took it out of your hand and laughed before pulling you into a side hug&nbsp;&ldquo;the look on Mr. Williams&rsquo; face was great, ugh I hate that guy&rdquo; you grumbled before taking the paper back from Peter, you looked over to Ned and saw the little figurine in his hand a narrowed your eyes in confusion, you cocked your head to the side&nbsp;&ldquo;Ned&hellip; why&rsquo;re you carrying around a Lego figurine?&rdquo; you asked, he quickly lit up and started telling you about the new Lego Death Star he had,&nbsp;&ldquo;anyway, I&rsquo;ll knock out the bones of the Death Star at my place. Then I&rsquo;ll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops&rdquo; he further explained,&nbsp;&ldquo;that&rsquo;d be great. Y/n, you wanna help?&rdquo; Peter asked, you sucked in a breath between your teeth&nbsp;&ldquo;I would but I don&rsquo;t want to&rdquo; you said causing the two boys to let out a laugh and shake their heads,&nbsp;&ldquo;anyway I gotta get to class, see you at lunch!&rdquo; you called behind you whilst you walked away.<br /></p><p>You were sat next to Peter and Ned in the Cafeteria, you reached over and grabbed Peter&rsquo;s cookie before breaking it in half, leaving the one half for yourself. &ldquo;Did Liz get a new top?&rdquo; you heard your brother ask his friend, you paused and looked at them&nbsp;&ldquo;no. We&rsquo;ve seen that before, but never with that skirt&rdquo; you rolled your eyes and scoffed at Ned&rsquo;s reply, you continued to eat your food.&nbsp;&ldquo;We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy though&rdquo; your head snapped up at your brother,&nbsp;&ldquo;too late. You guys are losers&rdquo; you let out a laugh at MJ&rsquo;s comment&nbsp;&ldquo;she&rsquo;s not wrong&rdquo; you muttered which made Peter and Ned glare at you.</p><p>You let out a groan when you saw Flash making his way over, he walked past&nbsp;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s up, Penis Parker?&rdquo; he asked with a smirk, you let out what sounded like a growl and stood up, ignoring Peter&rsquo;s protests you marched over to Flash and tapped him on the shoulder, he turned around and looked at you with a grin plastered on his face,&nbsp;&ldquo;you know what, Flash? For somebody who loves to boast about how straight he is, you sure do go on about my brother&rsquo;s dick a lot&hellip; is there something you&rsquo;d like to share with everybody or?&rdquo; you trailed off, most of the Cafeteria were watching intently and the two of you,&nbsp;&ldquo;what, Peter&rsquo;s too scared to fight his own battles so he had to send his little sister?&rdquo; he mocked, you rolled your eyes&nbsp;&ldquo;personally I don&rsquo;t think Peter should have to waste his breath on somebody who&rsquo;s main goal in life is to be a contender on the Bachelor&rdquo; you stepped closer,&nbsp;&ldquo;now, do us both a favour and shut your mouth&rdquo;.</p><p>You stepped back and smiled at him before walking back to your table, you sat down and ignored everybody&rsquo;s gazes, you took a bite out of the cookie before spitting it back out into a napkin&nbsp;&ldquo;ew, who the fuck puts raisins in cookies&rdquo; you grunted before letting out a sigh. You turned to your brother who was just staring at you&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/n, how many times have I told you not to chew him out like that&rdquo; he groaned, you shrugged your shoulders&nbsp;&ldquo;somebody has to put him in his place, and who better to do that than me&rdquo; you said before putting what was left of your food on the tray,&nbsp;&ldquo;see you soon!&rdquo; you called behind your shoulder as you walked off.</p><p>You were sat next to Abraham whilst Liz quizzed the academic decathlon team, &ldquo;next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?&rdquo; Liz asked, Charles beat you and rung the bell &ldquo;Hydrogen&rsquo;s the lightest. That&rsquo;s not the question. Okay. Yeah&rdquo; you snickered slightly causing him to glare at you, you turned to Abraham who rung the bell&nbsp;&ldquo;Uranium&rdquo; he spoke, you high fived him when Liz told him it was correct. You rolled your eyes when you heard Flash speak&nbsp;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve never even been in the same room as Tony Stark&rdquo; he snickered,&nbsp;&ldquo;wait, what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; one of the girls asked, somebody explained that Peter wasn&rsquo;t going to Washington,&nbsp;&ldquo;wait what? Right before nationals?&rdquo; you asked, he shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He already quit marching band and robotics lab&rdquo; everyone turned to MJ,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not obsessed with him. Just very observant.&rdquo; She spoke quickly causing you to laugh quietly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Flash, you&rsquo;re in for Peter&rdquo; Liz said which made you let out a groan and hit your head on the desk,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up&rdquo; he sarcastically spoke, you looked at him&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can vouch for Black Widow herself when I say she&rsquo;d never go out with a greasy little shithead&rdquo; you deadpanned, you heard the class snicker quietly.&nbsp;</p><p>You were chasing your brother who was walking outside of the school, you quickly caught up with him and grabbed his shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;Peter! What&rsquo;d you mean you&rsquo;re not coming to Washington?&rdquo; you asked, he rolled his eyes at your annoyed tone,&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to be here in case Mister Stark needs me&rdquo; he explained, you narrowed your eyes&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure you can take a weekend off&hellip; C&rsquo;mon, Pete. You&rsquo;re really gonna leave me alone with Flash?&rdquo; you groaned, he laughed and shook his head before jumping the school gate, he turned to you&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;ll be fine, I&rsquo;ll see you later!&rdquo; he yelled before running off, you let out a sigh and started walking to your apartment.</p><p>You and Ned were sat on Peter&rsquo;s bed, you had almost completed the Death Star. You froze when you heard the window open, you looked at Ned with wide eyes&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>please tell me he took off the suit</i>&rsquo; you thought in your head. You turned to where Ned was staring. Peter was crawling on the ceiling, he closed the door quietly using his webs he jumped down and let out a sigh before turning around and freezing at the site of Ned. You jumped when he dropped the Death Star,&nbsp;&ldquo;dude! we spent ages on that!&rdquo; you whined, Ned completely ignored you and continued to gape at Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Spider-Man. From YouTube&rdquo; he stuttered out, Peter quickly took off the suit causing you to cover your eyes&nbsp;&ldquo;ew&rdquo; you mumbled, Peter shook his head&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&rdquo; he sounded panicked.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, he literally saw you crawling on the ceiling with the suit on&rdquo; you said with a slight laugh, you could feel him glare at you&nbsp;&ldquo;Ned, what&rsquo;re you doing in my room?&rdquo; he asked, you rolled your eyes. Of course he forgot. Ned explained that May had let him in,&nbsp;&ldquo;you said we were gonna finish the Death Star&rdquo; he said. Peter was about to say something when May walked in &ldquo;that turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let&rsquo;s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?&rdquo; May asked, Ned nodded his head but Peter interrupted before he could say anything,&nbsp;&ldquo;no! He&rsquo;s got a thing&rdquo; he said quickly, May nodded her head and left the room closing the door behind her.&nbsp;&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Ned asked, Peter shook his head whilst he pulled on a jumper,&nbsp;&ldquo;nobody knows! Well, Y/n and Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; He explained.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony Stark made you that!? Are you an Avenger?&rdquo; Ned asked excitedly, Peter shrugged his shoulders but grinned &ldquo;yeah, basically.&rdquo; You snorted a laugh and shook your head, he glared at you before turning back to Ned, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret&rdquo; he begged, him and Ned were now by the door.</p><p>Ned narrowed his eyes,&nbsp;&ldquo;a secret? Why?&rdquo; he asked, Peter let out a groan of annoyance&nbsp;&ldquo;you know what she&rsquo;s like&rdquo; he motioned outside the room,&nbsp;&ldquo;if she finds out people try and kill me every night, she&rsquo;s not gonna let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, Please?&rdquo; He sounded desperate at this point, you understood why. May was fiercely protective over the both of you, if anything happened to either one of you she&rsquo;d rip New York apart.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, okay.
