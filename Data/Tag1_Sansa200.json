Jon knows that going South is the only way to save them all; save the realm and save his family - Sansa knows that people, even good hearted ones like Tyrion, can\u2019t be trusted solely on their word. Jon may be irritated that Sansa is questioning him in front of everyone once again, about a decision he believes has to be made because it is the only way to save everything he\u2019s fought so hard to protect. That\u2019s perhaps the angle at which Kit is approaching this video, speaking from Jon\u2019s voice rather than his own.\u00a0Understandably as an actor you would not want to cloud your personal understanding of your character by looking too in-depth into another characters point of view. A lot of actors work this way, choosing to not read source material or interact too much with fan theories for this purpose.\u00a0</p><p>But as an audience we have much more of an obligation.

She knows that not only did her father and brother both die going South, but so did her grandfather and uncle. It\u2019s a risky idea to say the least, especially if you could just send an advisor instead. Not to mention that its not a popular one among the people who just put him in power. On top of this, is the fact that Jon did not include Sansa is this conversation, AGAIN. He announced his decision in a room full of people without talking to her - the Lady of Winterfell - about this political and personal choice. We see him turn to her as he makes this announcement, and we see the shock on her face as he does so. This could have been a fight they had behind closed doors if Jon had included her in the conversation to begin with. The Lords doubted Jon because they agreed with Sansa - but if they came to the table united, and with certainty, it would have been a better political move - but Jon does not know this (I think he will come to learn that he needs to listen to Sansa and understand that she is actually quite intelligent if he is to maintain his position and actually do it well).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Sansa as we know from Sophie\u2019s interview was happy for the first time in the show when she reunited with Jon. Happy for the first time in however many years (Like at least 6 right??) - and the fear of losing Jon, her last and only source of family and happiness in the world is overwhelming. So in that scene both of them are pulling the emotional string of the other, both of them are probably incredibly annoyed by the other. That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t care for each other, but in fact are doing everything in their power to do what they think will keep one another safe. </p>",

Jon knows that going South is the only way to save them all; save the realm and save his family - Sansa knows that people, even good hearted ones like Tyrion, can\u2019t be trusted solely on their word. Jon may be irritated that Sansa is questioning him in front of everyone once again, about a decision he believes has to be made because it is the only way to save everything he\u2019s fought so hard to protect. That\u2019s perhaps the angle at which Kit is approaching this video, speaking from Jon\u2019s voice rather than his own.\u00a0Understandably as an actor you would not want to cloud your personal understanding of your character by looking too in-depth into another characters point of view. A lot of actors work this way, choosing to not read source material or interact too much with fan theories for this purpose.\u00a0</p><p>But as an audience we have much more of an obligation. And we know that Sansa\u2019s the master of Westros\u2019s political game at this point, she\u2019s learned from the best after all. She knows that not only did her father and brother both die going South, but so did her grandfather and uncle. It\u2019s a risky idea to say the least, especially if you could just send an advisor instead. Not to mention that its not a popular one among the people who just put him in power. On top of this, is the fact that Jon did not include Sansa is this conversation, AGAIN. He announced his decision in a room full of people without talking to her - the Lady of Winterfell - about this political and personal choice. We see him turn to her as he makes this announcement, and we see the shock on her face as he does so. This could have been a fight they had behind closed doors if Jon had included her in the conversation to begin with. The Lords doubted Jon because they agreed with Sansa - but if they came to the table united, and with certainty, it would have been a better political move - but Jon does not know this (I think he will come to learn that he needs to listen to Sansa and understand that she is actually quite intelligent if he is to maintain his position and actually do it well).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Sansa as we know from Sophie\u2019s interview was happy for the first time in the show when she reunited with Jon. Happy for the first time in however many years (Like at least 6 right??) - and the fear of losing Jon, her last and only source of family and happiness in the world is overwhelming. So in that scene both of them are pulling the emotional string of the other, both of them are probably incredibly annoyed by the other. That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t care for each other, but in fact are doing everything in their power to do what they think will keep one another safe. </p>",
                "content": "<p>I don&rsquo;t think Kit saying he finds Sansa &lsquo;annoying&rsquo; to be anything of concern.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, Kit says things like this all the time about both Sansa and Sophie jokingly, and I think its just an aspect of their friendship. Second, as an audience member it would be rather foolish to look at that scene in such a one dimensional sense. Even if you don&rsquo;t care too much about the personal relationship between Jon and Sansa understanding the dynamic between them is important.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon is a military man, Sansa is a politician; they&rsquo;ve both been naive children, they&rsquo;ve both manipulated and been manipulated, and they both have grown to understand that trusting people is a dangerous game. In that scene in the great hall both of them are coming from a place of emotion.

He took a song and a kiss, and left me nothing but a bloody cloak.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s romantic desires are very different to Dany and Arianne. Her romantic desires were shaped by the following:</p><p>1.) Witnessing Ned and Cats loving, healthy marriage. Ned is not violent, he is kind and respectful. </p><p>2.) The songs she loves so much, of brave, gentle knights and fair maidens. </p><p>3.) Something many readers forget: her falling \u201cwildly in love\u201d with Jon stand in** Waymar Royce.</p><p>Her fantasies of Willas are not of \u201ccruel kisses\u201d, violence, etc. Instead, they are of puppies and children that look like her siblings and listening to lutes. A stark (forgive the pun) contrast indeed. </p><p>On top of that, her crush on Loras is a mark against her supposed \u201cdesire\u201d for Sandor. Loras suits her physical \u201ctype\u201dmuch better ***. When she fantasizes about him, she daydreams of kissing him, running her hands through his hair, and touching his chest muscles. More sensual than her chaste daydreams of a marriage to Joffrey from AGOT, certainly, but nowhere near as sexual as certain members of the fandom make it out to be. </p><p>Lastly, and most importantly, she does daydream about receiving \u201clovers kisses\u201d.

The green fire, hailed by so many as romantic, is a symbol of violence and a horrific death by fire throughout the story.

                "content": "<p><h1>On &ldquo;cruel mouth&rdquo; as romantic foreshadowing </h1><p>Or:Why Sansans are the masters at projecting their adult sexual  desires onto an 11-13 year old child </p><p>One common Sansan argument is that Sansa&rsquo;s description of the UnKiss, in AFFC, as &ldquo;his cruel mouth pressing down on hers&rdquo;, is echoed by Dany and Arianne. </p><p>Here I will demonstrate that this is a overly-simplistic reading of the text.</p><p>1.) Arianne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cruel mouth&rdquo; quote:&rdquo; Ser Gerold Dayne had an aquiline nose, high cheekbones, a strong jaw. He kept his face clean-shaven, but his thick hair fell to his collar like a silver glacier, divided by a streak of midnight black. He has a<span class=\"npf_color_joey\"> cruel mouth</span>, though, and a crueler tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>This is describing Darkstar, and is used by Sansans as proof that Sansa wants Sandor. However, Arianne is a 22-23 year old woman, whereas Sansa is barely a teenager. Arianne has a very different view of sex, as she has heavily hinted at having a crush on her own Uncle, Oberyn. </p><p>Oh, and Darkstar was created to mock women who go after cruel man in the hopes of saving them. Need I say more?</p><p>2.) Dany&rsquo;s quote:&rdquo;The girl in her wanted to kiss him so much it hurt.
