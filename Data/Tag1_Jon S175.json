So most of my reblogs are Fandom related, but i also love Fashion and Photography and follow some Good tumblrs about them.  I'm also a Simmer, but hardly post Sim related stuff in here, i have a Simblr with a rather similar name. Thanks for visiting me, see you soon!",

You had formed a secret relationship with him in the time before he went to the Night\u2019s Watch. And now you where facing the consequences of your last night with Jon Snow</p><p>Warnings: Unplanned Pregnancy, bit of fluff at the end\u2026That should be it?</p><hr><p>The warmth was consuming. The covers you\u2019d buried yourself under last night trapping in the heat over your body. The sunlight peeking into your room through the shutters of your room hitting your eyelids.</p><p>It had been a month and a half since you\u2019d been in Winterfell. A month and a half since you\u2019d last seen him. Coal like black hair which fell in curls around his face. The dark brown eyes which held so much emotion you wouldn\u2019t be able to get out with in the two fortnights you\u2019d been there.</p><p>And you didn\u2019t.</p><!-- more --><p>Your eyelids fluttered open only to have the sting of the bright light hitting your eyes. Snapping your eyes shut once more you rolled your body over to face the door way. Opening them once more to see the lightly colored stone that made up the four walls of your room. You hated it here.</p><p>You could hear the sound of your mother outside of the door talking to your handmaiden. You couldn\u2019t make out what they where saying but you could make out their voices.</p><p>Closing your eyes once more you pulled the covers over your head to shield you from the sun\u2019s rays hitting the back of your head. The sound of the heavy wooden door squeaking as it opened you swear could be heard from Dorne.</p><p>\u201cCome here my little lion.\u201d</p><p>You wearily pulled the covers from your face to see your mother rushing towards you. \u201cI heard you weren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d She said pulling the blanket away from your head completely to get a look at you.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look very well little lion.\u201d You laughed slightly and nodded your head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well mother.\u201d</p><p>You were nauseous, your abdomen had pains, you were exhausted, you had a headache, your back hurt and your chest was tender.</p><p>\u201cYour grace? Should I inform Maester Pycell of her condition?\u201d Your handmaiden was sweet. Caring towards you, Myrcella and Tommen. Her name was Miza and she used to just be an orphan peasant girl down in King\u2019s Landing. If not for your uncle Tyrion she would have starved to death on the streets</p><p>\u201cYes, Miza. Thank you.\u201d Your mother replied curtly brushing some of your golden hair behind your ear. \u201cYou are going to be alright little lion. You will be chasing Tommen down the corridors again in a few days.\u201d She said with a smile</p><p>You two sat like that for the minutes. With you looking around the room wearily while your mother stroked your tangled golden hair in worry. You where the second oldest child of Cersei and Robert Baratheon.

Why are you writing this down?\u201d You questioned feeling your eyebrows furrow in confusion without you even making them.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you bled?\u201d</p><p>Was he avoiding your question? You watched as he placed a stray sheet of parchment on the page he was writing on so he could find it again as he then turned to another page.</p><p>\u201cTwo months ago?\u201d It came out as more of a question. But at the answer you gave your mother stiffened. And out of the corner of your eye you could see her look up from the covers to Maester Pycell. You craned your head to look up at your mother as she gave Maester Pycell a stern look. She\u2019s seen that look before. The look she gave someone when they where about to say something she didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, if you don\u2019t mind me asking.

I shall go tell the king.\u201d</p><p>Your heart dropped, You could remember what he had said to you.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, I don\u2019t think we should. I don\u2019t want to put a bastard in your belly.\u201d</i></p><p>You had convinced him that it\u2019d be fine. That you wouldn\u2019t fall pregnant with his child. It felt like the entire world stopped. Like you where looking at him again right after he\u2019d said it. How he looked worried even at the thought of you carrying his bastard.</p><p>You could feel your mother leave your side quickly and the sound of your door slamming shut and something hitting it which snapped you out of you trance \u201cYou tell Robert and I\u2019ll have your head on a spike before supper!\u201d Your mother growled. She had him by the collar of his clothing and shoved against the door. You could see the fear in his eyes as they locked with Cersei\u2019s certainly fiery eyes. \u201cDo not tell the king\u201d She said firmly before letting him go. He\u2019d nodded and rushed out the door.</p><p>Your mother turned to you with a small sad smile. \u201cWhat happened my little lion? I thought you\u2019d wait until you were married.\u201d She had tears in her eyes</p><p>You could feel tears start to swell in your eyes. \u201cI loved him\u201d You choked out before the tears fell onto your cheeks and the sobs began to rack through your body.</p><p>The next thing you knew your mother had you in a firm hold.

You could admit that the future lord of Winterfell was handsome, but he seemed to have other priorities than you. And he wasn\u2019t your type. He wasn\u2019t the brooding kind like Jon was.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d He questioned curiously which just made you laugh even harder. Gripping your stomach you slouched over as the laughing began to hurt your sides.</p><p>You felt him grab your hips before turning you to him \u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201c He questioned.</p><p>Your laughter died down as you saw another smile on his lips. He looked good with a smile like this one. The kind where the outer corners of his eyes crinkled. Your smile got a bit smaller until it was just a grin.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to be seen with Robb I would be around him more.\u201d You admitted</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>You lost control of yourself. You where just a few inches away from his lips. You right hand had come up and cupped his left cheek. Your thumb stroking the soft skin on his jaw. Your smile was gone completely as you just stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d You murmured to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t backing away, his hands where still on your hips as he stared right back at you.</p><p>\u201cI-I do-n\u2019t think I sh-should\u201d He stammered</p><p>\u201cI think you should.\u201d You encouraged with a new gentle smile coming up onto your face.</p><p>\u201cAs your princess, I command you too.\u201d You joked.</p><p>He\u2019d only smiled at you before one of his hands snaked to the small of your back and the other stayed on your waist. He pulled you a bit closer to him. You took a step towards him and brought your other hand up to his other cheek and pulled him down connecting your lips with his.</p>",

Snapping your eyes shut once more you rolled your body over to face the door way. Opening them once more to see the lightly colored stone that made up the four walls of your room. You hated it here.</p><p>You could hear the sound of your mother outside of the door talking to your handmaiden. You couldn\u2019t make out what they where saying but you could make out their voices.</p><p>Closing your eyes once more you pulled the covers over your head to shield you from the sun\u2019s rays hitting the back of your head. The sound of the heavy wooden door squeaking as it opened you swear could be heard from Dorne.</p><p>\u201cCome here my little lion.\u201d</p><p>You wearily pulled the covers from your face to see your mother rushing towards you. \u201cI heard you weren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d She said pulling the blanket away from your head completely to get a look at you.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look very well little lion.\u201d You laughed slightly and nodded your head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well mother.\u201d</p><p>You were nauseous, your abdomen had pains, you were exhausted, you had a headache, your back hurt and your chest was tender.</p><p>\u201cYour grace? Should I inform Maester Pycell of her condition?\u201d Your handmaiden was sweet. Caring towards you, Myrcella and Tommen. Her name was Miza and she used to just be an orphan peasant girl down in King\u2019s Landing. If not for your uncle Tyrion she would have starved to death on the streets</p><p>\u201cYes, Miza. Thank you.\u201d Your mother replied curtly brushing some of your golden hair behind your ear. \u201cYou are going to be alright little lion. You will be chasing Tommen down the corridors again in a few days.\u201d She said with a smile</p><p>You two sat like that for the minutes. With you looking around the room wearily while your mother stroked your tangled golden hair in worry. You where the second oldest child of Cersei and Robert Baratheon.

The sound of the heavy wooden door squeaking as it opened you swear could be heard from Dorne.</p><p>\u201cCome here my little lion.\u201d</p><p>You wearily pulled the covers from your face to see your mother rushing towards you. \u201cI heard you weren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d She said pulling the blanket away from your head completely to get a look at you.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look very well little lion.\u201d You laughed slightly and nodded your head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well mother.\u201d</p><p>You were nauseous, your abdomen had pains, you were exhausted, you had a headache, your back hurt and your chest was tender.</p><p>\u201cYour grace? Should I inform Maester Pycell of her condition?\u201d Your handmaiden was sweet. Caring towards you, Myrcella and Tommen. Her name was Miza and she used to just be an orphan peasant girl down in King\u2019s Landing. If not for your uncle Tyrion she would have starved to death on the streets</p><p>\u201cYes, Miza. Thank you.\u201d Your mother replied curtly brushing some of your golden hair behind your ear. \u201cYou are going to be alright little lion. You will be chasing Tommen down the corridors again in a few days.\u201d She said with a smile</p><p>You two sat like that for the minutes. With you looking around the room wearily while your mother stroked your tangled golden hair in worry. You where the second oldest child of Cersei and Robert Baratheon. The oldest daughter Cersei had, and gods did she love you. The moment the Septa had handed you to her she was in amazement. She had believed that you where the best thing that she ever made.</p><p>You remembered the story your father had told you. How she wouldn\u2019t even let him near you for at least a month.</p><p>\u201cYour grace.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes dashed over to the Maester as he entered your chambers. You hadn\u2019t even heard the door open. Maybe you were so out of it you didn\u2019t register the door squeaking open and closed. Or maybe witches were real like all the stories your septa had told you.</p><p>\u201cMaester Pycell\u201d Your mother greeted.</p><p>Your mother always had a distaste for Maester Pycell, not that you knew why she did. You usually minded your own business, having been told that was what ladies did.</p><p>\u201cHow are you princess?\u201d</p><p>You where able to force a weak smile and a small shrug of the shoulder that was facing the ceiling.</p><p>There was an abundance of questions, from the Maester, most of the answers he seemed to dislike. You where forced to sit up with the help of your mother so he could take a proper look at you to see what was wrong.</p><p>\u201cMiza says you\u2019ve been throwing up the food she tries to give you?\u201d</p><p>You nodded as you rested your head on your mother\u2019s shoulder. Her grip on your waist tightened very slightly. You could practically see the worried look on her face even though you weren\u2019t facing her</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d You replied looking up at him as he wrote in a book with his quill. She didn\u2019t understand why he thought to write down into a book</p><p>\u201cMaester Pycell? Why are you writing this down?\u201d You questioned feeling your eyebrows furrow in confusion without you even making them.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you bled?\u201d</p><p>Was he avoiding your question? You watched as he placed a stray sheet of parchment on the page he was writing on so he could find it again as he then turned to another page.</p><p>\u201cTwo months ago?\u201d It came out as more of a question. But at the answer you gave your mother stiffened. And out of the corner of your eye you could see her look up from the covers to Maester Pycell. You craned your head to look up at your mother as she gave Maester Pycell a stern look. She\u2019s seen that look before. The look she gave someone when they where about to say something she didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, if you don\u2019t mind me asking. Have you lost your maidenhood?\u201d</p><p>Your mother\u2019s face then contorted into a look of anger. \u201cI think thats quite enough Maester Pycell\u201d She said firmly</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d You answered quickly looking to the Maester trying to stay composed as his lips went into a straight line.</p><p>\u201cYour symptoms seem to point to the conclusion that you\u2019re with child. I shall go tell the king.\u201d</p><p>Your heart dropped, You could remember what he had said to you.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N, I don\u2019t think we should. I don\u2019t want to put a bastard in your belly.\u201d</i></p><p>You had convinced him that it\u2019d be fine. That you wouldn\u2019t fall pregnant with his child. It felt like the entire world stopped. Like you where looking at him again right after he\u2019d said it. How he looked worried even at the thought of you carrying his bastard.</p><p>You could feel your mother leave your side quickly and the sound of your door slamming shut and something hitting it which snapped you out of you trance \u201cYou tell Robert and I\u2019ll have your head on a spike before supper!\u201d Your mother growled. She had him by the collar of his clothing and shoved against the door. You could see the fear in his eyes as they locked with Cersei\u2019s certainly fiery eyes. \u201cDo not tell the king\u201d She said firmly before letting him go. He\u2019d nodded and rushed out the door.</p><p>Your mother turned to you with a small sad smile. \u201cWhat happened my little lion? I thought you\u2019d wait until you were married.\u201d She had tears in her eyes</p><p>You could feel tears start to swell in your eyes. \u201cI loved him\u201d You choked out before the tears fell onto your cheeks and the sobs began to rack through your body.</p><p>The next thing you knew your mother had you in a firm hold. Your head against her chest, her chin resting atop your head and her arms wrapped firmly around you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay little lion, I\u2019ll get you through this\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should really be seen with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the king\u2019s daughter, and i\u2019m the bastard of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>You had a smile on your face before you looked up and to your left to see him smiling down at you as well. Those eyes looked so dark as you stood there in the Godswood. But oh how they sparkled. \u00a0His hair fell around his face as he then looked down the grass by his feet.</p><p>\u201cWho do you suggest I should be seen with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t mean to laugh but you did. You could admit that the future lord of Winterfell was handsome, but he seemed to have other priorities than you. And he wasn\u2019t your type. He wasn\u2019t the brooding kind like Jon was.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d He questioned curiously which just made you laugh even harder. Gripping your stomach you slouched over as the laughing began to hurt your sides.</p><p>You felt him grab your hips before turning you to him \u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201c He questioned.</p><p>Your laughter died down as you saw another smile on his lips. He looked good with a smile like this one. The kind where the outer corners of his eyes crinkled. Your smile got a bit smaller until it was just a grin.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to be seen with Robb I would be around him more.\u201d You admitted</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>You lost control of yourself. You where just a few inches away from his lips. You right hand had come up and cupped his left cheek. Your thumb stroking the soft skin on his jaw. Your smile was gone completely as you just stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d You murmured to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t backing away, his hands where still on your hips as he stared right back at you.</p><p>\u201cI-I do-n\u2019t think I sh-should\u201d He stammered</p><p>\u201cI think you should.\u201d You encouraged with a new gentle smile coming up onto your face.</p><p>\u201cAs your princess, I command you too.\u201d You joked.</p><p>He\u2019d only smiled at you before one of his hands snaked to the small of your back and the other stayed on your waist. He pulled you a bit closer to him. You took a step towards him and brought your other hand up to his other cheek and pulled him down connecting your lips with his.</p></p>",

He is a little Brother, even in the Show he had two elder Siblings from Elia and Rhaegar, he is in Kings Landing (possibly because Cersei kidnapped Sansa) and because she threatens her, he chokes her to death. I just hope Sansa survives, I could imagine that Cersei kills her or trying to, than Jon snaps and kills her. IlargiZuri",
        "answer": "<p>Dear IlargiZuri,</p><p>Sorry answering took me so long! I have to many asks in my inbox! This got long, so read on after the cut.</p><!-- more --><p>Tbh, I\u2019m not sure who will kill Cersei. The only thing I\u2019m sure about is that it won\u2019t be Tyrion. Cersei herself identifies the valonqar in the prophecy she got with Tyrion and that probably means it is false, because people in the books tend to misinterpret prophecy. Also Tyrion in ADWD fantasizes far too often about killing Cersei and GRRM tends to deny his characters what they want - or gives it to them in a twisted way. </p><p>The general interpretation for the valonqar is Jaime, because he is also a younger brother of Cersei and she doesn\u2019t think that he would kill her. From the way they both see their twisted relationship it would also make sense : They think they\u2019ll leave the world together. I also thought for a long time that Cersei would be killed by Jaime. But recently I got the idea that Jaime might be the one Lannister who survives (and become Hand of the King). And just because Jaime and Cersei think they will leave the world together (and wish it in a way) that does not mean that they <b>will</b> die like that. Jaime dying as an old man in the arms of the woman he loves (Brienne) is one of my favourite new headcanons.</p><p>With prophecies we usually have three: one the character thinks is the one who will fulfill the prophecy, one the reader thinks is the one and one who actually is the one. So, Cersei thinks it\u2019s Tyrion, the reader thinks it\u2019s Jaime and GRRM unmasks another possibility.<br/></p><p>Now, that leaves any younger sibling as a killer for Cersei. I think we can agree that it should be a POV character. Cersei\u2019s death should not happen off screen. Brienne is the only one I would count out. She is an only child. <br/></p><p>I don\u2019t know about Davos as a sibling, but I doubt he would strangle a woman whom he might have only met once or twice. The idea of strangling that comes with the prophecy would involve a personal vendetta, I think. Strangling is the method of a killer who is beyond himself /herself. It is not the sign of cold blooded murder. </p><p>As things stand now the only POVs who have an emotional history with Cersei are Arya and Sansa (both younger siblings). Arya has even openly declared her intention to kill Cersei. But Arya decided that it was more important to go home than to try and kill Cersei. She sort of left her vendetta for supporting her family (and ironically ended helping Sansa, not Jon for whom she originally went home, after a lot of misunderstanding and misdirections). I think it would be a step backward for her, if she went back to revenge. In the books Arya\u2019s arc is about mercy and revenge and my guess is that bookwise Arya will have her moment of deciding to let go of her revenge when she meets Lady Stoneheart, and we\u2019ll only see her mercy killing or in defence of her family afterwards. The show did cut that short, but I believe that Arya is more of a defender now, not exactly a knight, but someone with a moral codex. To me it looks like Arya is the show\u2019s obvious answer, like Jaime is in the books, and this might mean that Arya is not the one to do the deed, because everyone suspects it.<br/></p><p>As for Sansa: although I believe that she has a very personal history with Cersei, I don\u2019t see her strangling someone. Her killing Ramsay was a very rare deed. She let him be killed by his own dogs without a trial, and although I can understand her action, I don\u2019t particularly like it. I was glad, that she put Littlefinger on trial for his crimes (although Bran\u2019s visionary evidence wouldn\u2019t pass in any modern law court). <br/></p><p>Now, if Cersei kidnaps Sansa the highly emotional moment we would need for strangling might come into it. Any of the Starklings might be provoked enough to kill Cersei, maybe even Jon. We saw him lose his self-restraint several times when the people he loves are threatened, and \u2018kill bill sirens\u2019 Jon is feasible if Sansa is in danger. I must admit though, that I\u2019m not very partial to that theory. First of all I think that the \u2018Jon chokes Littlefinger\u2019 scene is too different thematically. Littlefinger did not endanger Sansa\u2019s life, but he was an inappropriate suitor (and maybe a rival, if the Jonsa fam is correct?), and Jon choking him was set up as a reminder of Ned choking Littlefinger. Cersei as an enemy, not a suitor would not fit into this pattern. The emotional investment of Jon would be something else than with Littlefinger. Of course the choking scene might be used for different purposes, for establishing Jon as a protector of Sansa (whether romantically or brotherly) and for foreshadowing, but I must admit that I doubt it, just because it does not feel very tidy because Littlefinger and Cersei play such different roles in this.<br/></p><p>Second, I\u2019m not very fond of the kidnap plot, because I think it would be a regress for Sansa\u2019s character development, not necessarily, if they do it right, but I would be very sceptic about that. I wouldn\u2019t put it beyond GRRM to put Sansa in the tower again, only to have her rescue herself, and not by the prince, but that is about the only variant I would like. Now, me not liking the kidnap plot of course does not mean, that it won\u2019t happen. Still, I don\u2019t think that it was necessarily foreshadowed that Jon kills Cersei. Also, I think for the Aragorn parallels of Jon to play out nicely it would be important that he is not the one who kills his rivals for the throne.<br/></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5o8TD9gV-3o5eP0tDSTsQ\">@undeadmanbun</a> had the idea that Bran might be the younger sibling to kill Cersei. And we chatted about this subject with several other Jonsas and that set me thinking.<br/></p><p>Bran is certainly capable of it: We saw that he can warg into humans, and he could just warg into the Mountain aka \u2018Robert Strong\u2019 and snuff her out like a candle. He also has a personal history with Cersei. It was for her sake that Jaime pushed him from that tower. I actually like the idea, because it would really come out of a deep left field and Bran could interfere from afar if Sansa is in danger. My only problem is, that Bran seems to be reserved for the \u2018magical\u2019 storyline and Cersei is not part of that. I\u2019m certain Bran will make a very important contribution to the fight against the White Walkers, if not even decisive, and this seems to be where his arc is leading. But it might be a misdirection of course. Bran gets all this magical education and then decides to use it for bringing order to Westeros (maybe after the WW are gone). If GRRM misdirects the reader into thinking that the dragons are the solution (when they actually might be the problem, or one of the problems) who can really say, that Bran\u2019s magical abilities are meant for the fight against the WW? Or that they can\u2019t be used for another purpose after the WW are defeated or even before that?\u00a0</p><p>So, I must admit that I personally would prefer Arya or Bran as the valonqar coming from the deep left field, with the abilities that they aquired for different purposes than killing Cersei: Arya\u2019s arc as a faceless man is about mercy and revenge and she might be the one who has to kill Da\u20acnerys, and Bran set up to be pitted against the WW, killing Cersei as an aside. It would also play nicely into the general characterisation of Cersei: That she thinks herself far more important than she is. If Bran or Arya kill Cersei, she is not the ulimate antagonist, because their arc does not converge towards this as the sole purpose. Cersei might also have a moment of recognition where she realises that Sansa is the younger more beautiful queen she dreaded almost her whole life. And it is the valonqar of the YMBQ who finally gives her the last blow.</p><p>I just add the relevant section in AFFC, Cersei VIII:</p><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Malice gleamed in \nMaggy&rsquo;s yellow eyes. &ldquo;Queen you shall be &hellip; until there comes \nanother, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that \nyou hold dear.&rdquo;\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>Anger flashed across the child&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;If she tries I will have my brother kill her.&rdquo; Even then she would not stop, willful child\n as she was. She still had one more question due her, one more glimpse \ninto her life to come. &ldquo;Will the king and I have children?&rdquo; she asked.\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>\nThat made no sense to \nCersei. Her thumb was throbbing where she&rsquo;d cut it, and her blood was \ndripping on the carpet. How could that be? she wanted to ask, but she \nwas done with her questions.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The old woman was not done with her, however. &ldquo;Gold shall be their\n crowns and gold their shrouds,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And when your tears have \ndrowned you, the <b>valonqar</b> shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.&rdquo;\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>But this all would not be complete, if I would not address one other thing, that is the strangling. The wording of Maggy seems to be straight forward enough: Cersei will be strangled by actual hands, but it could be that the life is choked from her in some other way: She might just die in the burning of King\u2019s Landing, that will probably happen in season 8. Then the person responsible for the burning would be the killer, and this might be Da\u20acnerys, who is also a younger sibling and I might add the person usually identified by the GA as the Younger Queen (because Margaery the one Cersei thinks is the Younger Queen is obviously wrong). <br/></p><p>Strangling might also be the poison known as the \u201cstrangler\u201d. If you look at the wording of the prophecy this might be the case if \u201cvalonqar\u201d would be the poison itself? And the poison is a weapon of the faceless men which would point towards Arya. <br/></p><p>So, my personal preference would be Arya or Bran, and if Arya was set up by the show as a red herring, Bran would be real good twist. It could happen in a scenario where any Stark is in danger and Bran has to interfere. I think this would work with the wording of Maggy\u2019s prophecy that leaves room for the interpretation the the valonqar is the younger brother of the Younger Queen.</p><p>Of course this depends on several other interpretations: Sansa as the Younger Queen (coming from the deep left field, dismissed by Cersei as being too stupid), Bran\u2019s magical arc giving him abilities he will use in defence of his family, Tyrion as red herring for Cersei and Jaime as red herring for the reader, and Jaime\u2019s arc actually ending in the arms of the woman he loves and Cersei and Jaime not leaving the world together (but maybe Jaime will be a different person and the brother-lover of Cersei will be \u2018dead\u2019 if not in a literal way). It would also leave place for Jon not to eliminate his adversaries personally, setting up a nice Aragorn parallel (which I\u2019m all in for). <br/></p><p>There is no way I can be sure about this, but I think that this would tie in nicely with the general arcs of the characters, so I\u2019m partial for Bran or Arya, Bran via warging (which would result in actual strangling), Arya maybe by using the poison of the strangler. Just that I like it, does not mean it will happen of course. The only thing I am really sure about is that Cersei will die next season and I hope she goes out with a bang and superb acting by Lena.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p>",

Her killing Ramsay was a very rare deed. She let him be killed by his own dogs without a trial, and although I can understand her action, I don\u2019t particularly like it. I was glad, that she put Littlefinger on trial for his crimes (although Bran\u2019s visionary evidence wouldn\u2019t pass in any modern law court). <br></p><p>Now, if Cersei kidnaps Sansa the highly emotional moment we would need for strangling might come into it. Any of the Starklings might be provoked enough to kill Cersei, maybe even Jon. We saw him lose his self-restraint several times when the people he loves are threatened, and \u2018kill bill sirens\u2019 Jon is feasible if Sansa is in danger. I must admit though, that I\u2019m not very partial to that theory. First of all I think that the \u2018Jon chokes Littlefinger\u2019 scene is too different thematically. Littlefinger did not endanger Sansa\u2019s life, but he was an inappropriate suitor (and maybe a rival, if the Jonsa fam is correct?), and Jon choking him was set up as a reminder of Ned choking Littlefinger. Cersei as an enemy, not a suitor would not fit into this pattern. The emotional investment of Jon would be something else than with Littlefinger. Of course the choking scene might be used for different purposes, for establishing Jon as a protector of Sansa (whether romantically or brotherly) and for foreshadowing, but I must admit that I doubt it, just because it does not feel very tidy because Littlefinger and Cersei play such different roles in this.<br></p><p>Second, I\u2019m not very fond of the kidnap plot, because I think it would be a regress for Sansa\u2019s character development, not necessarily, if they do it right, but I would be very sceptic about that. I wouldn\u2019t put it beyond GRRM to put Sansa in the tower again, only to have her rescue herself, and not by the prince, but that is about the only variant I would like. Now, me not liking the kidnap plot of course does not mean, that it won\u2019t happen. Still, I don\u2019t think that it was necessarily foreshadowed that Jon kills Cersei. Also, I think for the Aragorn parallels of Jon to play out nicely it would be important that he is not the one who kills his rivals for the throne.<br></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5o8TD9gV-3o5eP0tDSTsQ\">@undeadmanbun</a> had the idea that Bran might be the younger sibling to kill Cersei. And we chatted about this subject with several other Jonsas and that set me thinking.<br></p><p>Bran is certainly capable of it: We saw that he can warg into humans, and he could just warg into the Mountain aka \u2018Robert Strong\u2019 and snuff her out like a candle. He also has a personal history with Cersei. It was for her sake that Jaime pushed him from that tower. I actually like the idea, because it would really come out of a deep left field and Bran could interfere from afar if Sansa is in danger. My only problem is, that Bran seems to be reserved for the \u2018magical\u2019 storyline and Cersei is not part of that. I\u2019m certain Bran will make a very important contribution to the fight against the White Walkers, if not even decisive, and this seems to be where his arc is leading. But it might be a misdirection of course. Bran gets all this magical education and then decides to use it for bringing order to Westeros (maybe after the WW are gone). If GRRM misdirects the reader into thinking that the dragons are the solution (when they actually might be the problem, or one of the problems) who can really say, that Bran\u2019s magical abilities are meant for the fight against the WW? Or that they can\u2019t be used for another purpose after the WW are defeated or even before that?\u00a0</p><p>So, I must admit that I personally would prefer Arya or Bran as the valonqar coming from the deep left field, with the abilities that they aquired for different purposes than killing Cersei: Arya\u2019s arc as a faceless man is about mercy and revenge and she might be the one who has to kill Da\u20acnerys, and Bran set up to be pitted against the WW, killing Cersei as an aside. It would also play nicely into the general characterisation of Cersei: That she thinks herself far more important than she is. If Bran or Arya kill Cersei, she is not the ulimate antagonist, because their arc does not converge towards this as the sole purpose. Cersei might also have a moment of recognition where she realises that Sansa is the younger more beautiful queen she dreaded almost her whole life. And it is the valonqar of the YMBQ who finally gives her the last blow.</p><p>I just add the relevant section in AFFC, Cersei VIII:</p><blockquote><p>\n\u201cAye.\u201d Malice gleamed in \nMaggy\u2019s yellow eyes. \u201cQueen you shall be \u2026 until there comes \nanother, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that \nyou hold dear.\u201d\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br></p><p>Anger flashed across the child\u2019s face. \u201cIf she tries I will have my brother kill her.\u201d Even then she would not stop, willful child\n as she was. She still had one more question due her, one more glimpse \ninto her life to come. \u201cWill the king and I have children?\u201d she asked.\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cOh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you.\u201d <br></p><p>\nThat made no sense to \nCersei. Her thumb was throbbing where she\u2019d cut it, and her blood was \ndripping on the carpet. How could that be? she wanted to ask, but she \nwas done with her questions.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The old woman was not done with her, however. \u201cGold shall be their\n crowns and gold their shrouds,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when your tears have \ndrowned you, the <b>valonqar</b> shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.\u201d\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>But this all would not be complete, if I would not address one other thing, that is the strangling. The wording of Maggy seems to be straight forward enough: Cersei will be strangled by actual hands, but it could be that the life is choked from her in some other way: She might just die in the burning of King\u2019s Landing, that will probably happen in season 8. Then the person responsible for the burning would be the killer, and this might be Da\u20acnerys, who is also a younger sibling and I might add the person usually identified by the GA as the Younger Queen (because Margaery the one Cersei thinks is the Younger Queen is obviously wrong). <br></p><p>Strangling might also be the poison known as the \u201cstrangler\u201d. If you look at the wording of the prophecy this might be the case if \u201cvalonqar\u201d would be the poison itself? And the poison is a weapon of the faceless men which would point towards Arya. <br></p><p>So, my personal preference would be Arya or Bran, and if Arya was set up by the show as a red herring, Bran would be real good twist. It could happen in a scenario where any Stark is in danger and Bran has to interfere. I think this would work with the wording of Maggy\u2019s prophecy that leaves room for the interpretation the the valonqar is the younger brother of the Younger Queen.</p><p>Of course this depends on several other interpretations: Sansa as the Younger Queen (coming from the deep left field, dismissed by Cersei as being too stupid), Bran\u2019s magical arc giving him abilities he will use in defence of his family, Tyrion as red herring for Cersei and Jaime as red herring for the reader, and Jaime\u2019s arc actually ending in the arms of the woman he loves and Cersei and Jaime not leaving the world together (but maybe Jaime will be a different person and the brother-lover of Cersei will be \u2018dead\u2019 if not in a literal way). It would also leave place for Jon not to eliminate his adversaries personally, setting up a nice Aragorn parallel (which I\u2019m all in for). <br></p><p>There is no way I can be sure about this, but I think that this would tie in nicely with the general arcs of the characters, so I\u2019m partial for Bran or Arya, Bran via warging (which would result in actual strangling), Arya maybe by using the poison of the strangler. Just that I like it, does not mean it will happen of course. The only thing I am really sure about is that Cersei will die next season and I hope she goes out with a bang and superb acting by Lena.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br></p>",

This got long, so read on after the cut.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tbh, I\u2019m not sure who will kill Cersei. The only thing I\u2019m sure about is that it won\u2019t be Tyrion. Cersei herself identifies the valonqar in the prophecy she got with Tyrion and that probably means it is false, because people in the books tend to misinterpret prophecy. Also Tyrion in ADWD fantasizes far too often about killing Cersei and GRRM tends to deny his characters what they want - or gives it to them in a twisted way. </p><p>The general interpretation for the valonqar is Jaime, because he is also a younger brother of Cersei and she doesn\u2019t think that he would kill her. From the way they both see their twisted relationship it would also make sense : They think they\u2019ll leave the world together. I also thought for a long time that Cersei would be killed by Jaime. But recently I got the idea that Jaime might be the one Lannister who survives (and become Hand of the King). And just because Jaime and Cersei think they will leave the world together (and wish it in a way) that does not mean that they <b>will</b> die like that. Jaime dying as an old man in the arms of the woman he loves (Brienne) is one of my favourite new headcanons.</p><p>With prophecies we usually have three: one the character thinks is the one who will fulfill the prophecy, one the reader thinks is the one and one who actually is the one. So, Cersei thinks it\u2019s Tyrion, the reader thinks it\u2019s Jaime and GRRM unmasks another possibility.<br></p><p>Now, that leaves any younger sibling as a killer for Cersei. I think we can agree that it should be a POV character. Cersei\u2019s death should not happen off screen. Brienne is the only one I would count out. She is an only child. <br></p><p>I don\u2019t know about Davos as a sibling, but I doubt he would strangle a woman whom he might have only met once or twice. The idea of strangling that comes with the prophecy would involve a personal vendetta, I think. Strangling is the method of a killer who is beyond himself /herself. It is not the sign of cold blooded murder. </p><p>As things stand now the only POVs who have an emotional history with Cersei are Arya and Sansa (both younger siblings). Arya has even openly declared her intention to kill Cersei. But Arya decided that it was more important to go home than to try and kill Cersei. She sort of left her vendetta for supporting her family (and ironically ended helping Sansa, not Jon for whom she originally went home, after a lot of misunderstanding and misdirections). I think it would be a step backward for her, if she went back to revenge. In the books Arya\u2019s arc is about mercy and revenge and my guess is that bookwise Arya will have her moment of deciding to let go of her revenge when she meets Lady Stoneheart, and we\u2019ll only see her mercy killing or in defence of her family afterwards. The show did cut that short, but I believe that Arya is more of a defender now, not exactly a knight, but someone with a moral codex. To me it looks like Arya is the show\u2019s obvious answer, like Jaime is in the books, and this might mean that Arya is not the one to do the deed, because everyone suspects it.<br></p><p>As for Sansa: although I believe that she has a very personal history with Cersei, I don\u2019t see her strangling someone.

I was glad, that she put Littlefinger on trial for his crimes (although Bran&rsquo;s visionary evidence wouldn&rsquo;t pass in any modern law court). <br /></p><p>Now, if Cersei kidnaps Sansa the highly emotional moment we would need for strangling might come into it. Any of the Starklings might be provoked enough to kill Cersei, maybe even Jon. We saw him lose his self-restraint several times when the people he loves are threatened, and &lsquo;kill bill sirens&rsquo; Jon is feasible if Sansa is in danger. I must admit though, that I&rsquo;m not very partial to that theory. First of all I think that the &lsquo;Jon chokes Littlefinger&rsquo; scene is too different thematically. Littlefinger did not endanger Sansa&rsquo;s life, but he was an inappropriate suitor (and maybe a rival, if the Jonsa fam is correct?), and Jon choking him was set up as a reminder of Ned choking Littlefinger. Cersei as an enemy, not a suitor would not fit into this pattern. The emotional investment of Jon would be something else than with Littlefinger. Of course the choking scene might be used for different purposes, for establishing Jon as a protector of Sansa (whether romantically or brotherly) and for foreshadowing, but I must admit that I doubt it, just because it does not feel very tidy because Littlefinger and Cersei play such different roles in this.<br /></p><p>Second, I&rsquo;m not very fond of the kidnap plot, because I think it would be a regress for Sansa&rsquo;s character development, not necessarily, if they do it right, but I would be very sceptic about that. I wouldn&rsquo;t put it beyond GRRM to put Sansa in the tower again, only to have her rescue herself, and not by the prince, but that is about the only variant I would like. Now, me not liking the kidnap plot of course does not mean, that it won&rsquo;t happen. Still, I don&rsquo;t think that it was necessarily foreshadowed that Jon kills Cersei. Also, I think for the Aragorn parallels of Jon to play out nicely it would be important that he is not the one who kills his rivals for the throne.<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5o8TD9gV-3o5eP0tDSTsQ\">@undeadmanbun</a> had the idea that Bran might be the younger sibling to kill Cersei. And we chatted about this subject with several other Jonsas and that set me thinking.<br /></p><p>Bran is certainly capable of it: We saw that he can warg into humans, and he could just warg into the Mountain aka &lsquo;Robert Strong&rsquo; and snuff her out like a candle. He also has a personal history with Cersei. It was for her sake that Jaime pushed him from that tower. I actually like the idea, because it would really come out of a deep left field and Bran could interfere from afar if Sansa is in danger. My only problem is, that Bran seems to be reserved for the &lsquo;magical&rsquo; storyline and Cersei is not part of that. I&rsquo;m certain Bran will make a very important contribution to the fight against the White Walkers, if not even decisive, and this seems to be where his arc is leading. But it might be a misdirection of course. Bran gets all this magical education and then decides to use it for bringing order to Westeros (maybe after the WW are gone). If GRRM misdirects the reader into thinking that the dragons are the solution (when they actually might be the problem, or one of the problems) who can really say, that Bran&rsquo;s magical abilities are meant for the fight against the WW? Or that they can&rsquo;t be used for another purpose after the WW are defeated or even before that?&nbsp;</p><p>So, I must admit that I personally would prefer Arya or Bran as the valonqar coming from the deep left field, with the abilities that they aquired for different purposes than killing Cersei: Arya&rsquo;s arc as a faceless man is about mercy and revenge and she might be the one who has to kill Da&euro;nerys, and Bran set up to be pitted against the WW, killing Cersei as an aside. It would also play nicely into the general characterisation of Cersei: That she thinks herself far more important than she is. If Bran or Arya kill Cersei, she is not the ulimate antagonist, because their arc does not converge towards this as the sole purpose. Cersei might also have a moment of recognition where she realises that Sansa is the younger more beautiful queen she dreaded almost her whole life. And it is the valonqar of the YMBQ who finally gives her the last blow.</p><p>I just add the relevant section in AFFC, Cersei VIII:</p><blockquote><p>\n&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Malice gleamed in \nMaggy&rsquo;s yellow eyes. &ldquo;Queen you shall be &hellip; until there comes \nanother, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that \nyou hold dear.&rdquo;\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Anger flashed across the child&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;If she tries I will have my brother kill her.&rdquo; Even then she would not stop, willful child\n as she was. She still had one more question due her, one more glimpse \ninto her life to come. &ldquo;Will the king and I have children?&rdquo; she asked.\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>\nThat made no sense to \nCersei. Her thumb was throbbing where she&rsquo;d cut it, and her blood was \ndripping on the carpet. How could that be? she wanted to ask, but she \nwas done with her questions.\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The old woman was not done with her, however. &ldquo;Gold shall be their\n crowns and gold their shrouds,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And when your tears have \ndrowned you, the <b>valonqar</b> shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.&rdquo;\n &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n<br /></p></blockquote><p>But this all would not be complete, if I would not address one other thing, that is the strangling. The wording of Maggy seems to be straight forward enough: Cersei will be strangled by actual hands, but it could be that the life is choked from her in some other way: She might just die in the burning of King&rsquo;s Landing, that will probably happen in season 8. Then the person responsible for the burning would be the killer, and this might be Da&euro;nerys, who is also a younger sibling and I might add the person usually identified by the GA as the Younger Queen (because Margaery the one Cersei thinks is the Younger Queen is obviously wrong). <br /></p><p>Strangling might also be the poison known as the &ldquo;strangler&rdquo;. If you look at the wording of the prophecy this might be the case if &ldquo;valonqar&rdquo; would be the poison itself? And the poison is a weapon of the faceless men which would point towards Arya. <br /></p><p>So, my personal preference would be Arya or Bran, and if Arya was set up by the show as a red herring, Bran would be real good twist. It could happen in a scenario where any Stark is in danger and Bran has to interfere. I think this would work with the wording of Maggy&rsquo;s prophecy that leaves room for the interpretation the the valonqar is the younger brother of the Younger Queen.</p><p>Of course this depends on several other interpretations: Sansa as the Younger Queen (coming from the deep left field, dismissed by Cersei as being too stupid), Bran&rsquo;s magical arc giving him abilities he will use in defence of his family, Tyrion as red herring for Cersei and Jaime as red herring for the reader, and Jaime&rsquo;s arc actually ending in the arms of the woman he loves and Cersei and Jaime not leaving the world together (but maybe Jaime will be a different person and the brother-lover of Cersei will be &lsquo;dead&rsquo; if not in a literal way). It would also leave place for Jon not to eliminate his adversaries personally, setting up a nice Aragorn parallel (which I&rsquo;m all in for). <br /></p><p>There is no way I can be sure about this, but I think that this would tie in nicely with the general arcs of the characters, so I&rsquo;m partial for Bran or Arya, Bran via warging (which would result in actual strangling), Arya maybe by using the poison of the strangler. Just that I like it, does not mean it will happen of course. The only thing I am really sure about is that Cersei will die next season and I hope she goes out with a bang and superb acting by Lena.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br /></p>",
