You were a loyal guard to her, one of Jon\u2019s northsmen in fact. His faith in her was enough to convince you that she would be a suitable ruler of Westeros, though she currently resided in Winterfell. You were allowed into her room by the Unsullied that guarded the door. You stood at attention, hands folded behind your back.</p><p>Your queen smiled when she saw you, standing up and walking near to you. \u201c(Y/n), I\u2019m glad you came. I have a rather&hellip; unconventional proposition for you.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>You found yourself smiling in return. \u201cI would do anything for you, my queen. I\u2019ve known Jon since childhood, and you care so much for him. I trust you to guide my actions in a fit manner.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as you spoke but soon caressed your cheek with her gloved hand, stroking her thumb over your lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say that. Both that you trust me, and that you\u2019re so close with Jon. You see, we\u2019ve been searching for a third.\u201d</p><p>Hot blush rose to your cheeks, brought on by both her words and her unnaturally warm touch. \u201cA third, your grace?\u201d Your voice lowered, confidence fading.</p><p>She adored the innocent expression on your face. \u201cA third person, to share our bed for a night. Or perhaps for far longer, if all goes well. Would you be interested in pleasing us tonight?\u201d Her hand trailed down your neck and shoulder. \u201cYou should know, you reserve the right to say no. My position as your superior should not move your choice one way or the other.\u201d Her tone turned more gentle as she explained your ability to say no.</p><p>You felt heat pool in your stomach, your one hands slightly shaky. \u201cI want to please you tonight. Both you and Jon.\u201d You hadn\u2019t admitted your interest in men to someone in a long while, but your queen had a right to know in this situation.</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI thought perhaps you had an interest in him. I always hoped you had one in me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly do.\u201d Your eyes scanned over her, taking in all the aspects of her body. \u201cMay I touch you, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you can drop the titles while we\u2019re together. Call me Dany.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cDany.\u201d You muttered as you moved to caress her side, moving closer.</p><p>You pressed a few small kisses against her neck, moving aside her braid. She let off a small hum, running her hands up your back. </p><p>The door to the bedroom opened. You pulled back from Dany to see Jon standing a few feet from both of you. A small grin flashed across his features as he looked to his queen. \u201cHe agreed?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, running her fingers through your hair. \u201cHe did, quite willingly in fact. He wants to be intimate with <i>both</i> of us. He seems to have kept in some pent up feelings for his lord.\u201d</p><p>You looked down shyly, nodding in affirmation. Jon stepped over to you, cupping your face with both his hands. He pulled you into a small kiss that lasted only mere seconds. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a certain fondness for him as well.\u201d He said smoothly.</p><p>Dany approached her lover, kissing down his bearded jaw. \u201cWe seem to all be in agreement. Any of us can stop at any time, or simply break if needed. Especially (y/n). We don\u2019t need an unhealthy power dynamic.\u201d She placed a hand on your back gingerly. \u201cDoes that sound good?\u201d</p><p>After you and Jon both agreed, you were led to their large bed. Jon started to undress Dany, but she paused and shot a playful look at you. \u201cDe-robe him first, I want to see both of you together.\u201d</p><p>Jon obliged without a second thought. He kissed you gently as he unlaced your tunic and pushed your undershirt down your shoulders. You instinctively started to remove Jon\u2019s clothing as well, feeing up his torso and chest once his clothes had fallen to the ground. Despite having yours closed as you kissed Jon, you could feel Danny\u2019s eyes on both of you. Jon rolled his tongue against yours, making you whine softly. When you had gotten each other\u2019s clothes off, you broke apart to notice Dany waiting for you, already stripped down on the bed. </p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t stop on account of me.\u201d She teased.</p><p>Jon chuckled and took your hand in his, leading you to the bed with him. He bent down and left a small peck on Dany\u2019s lips. \u201cHow should we go about this, love?\u201d </p><p>She reached up to run her finger\u2019s over Jon\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019d adore seeing you in (y/n)\u2019s lap, riding him.\u201d She gripped his dark hair, forcing a small groan from his throat. \u201cAnd then once you\u2019re settled, <i>I\u2019ll</i> ride <i>you</i>.\u201d She purred in a low tone.</p><p>You watched as Jon\u2019s eyes lit up, obviously turned on by his partner\u2019s idea. He turned to you, stroking his thumb over your knuckles. \u201cHow does that sound to you?\u201d</p><p>You felt a small surge of dominance run through your veins as you crawled near to him, pressing a rough kiss against his throat. \u201cI\u2019d love to watch you bounce on my length. Bet you\u2019d look so damn pretty. You wanna feel me filling you up.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded rapidly. \u201cYes. Gods, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched that part of him in a while, he could use to be opened up first.\u201d Dany added.</p><p>You thought for a moment before coming up with a thought for a position.</p><p>You sat in the center of the bed, Jon folded at the waist as you opened him up, his head between Dany\u2019s thighs. You bent down to pepper small kisses across his back as slipped a second finger into his hole, scissoring them gently. He let out a moan agaisnt Dany before continuing to move his tongue across all the places that made her weak.</p><p>Dany shot you a sultry look. \u201cHe\u2019s probably almost ready. He likes a bit of burn.\u201d She gave Jon\u2019s hair a firm tug, making him whimper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to guide me.\u201d You said with a small chuckle as you removed your fingers from your other partner.</p><p>Dany guided Jon into a sitting position, his mouth still slick from her wet. He locked into her eyes and licked his lips, making her grin at how dirty he could get. You helped Jon take you in, pushing into him inch my inch until you hit your hilt. He choked back a sob of a moan as he started to roll his hips agaisnt your cock. You kissed his neck and started to stroke his length. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so good, Jon. Isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d Dany nodded as she moved herself into his lap, kissing him long and slow.</p><p>You gave him a few more firm strokes before Dany slid herself down onto Jon, biting back a groan. </p><p>You rolled you hips so your tip would grind into Jon\u2019s prostate while Dany pleasured his front. Both of you sucked hickies into his neck, occasionally sharing a kiss yourself. You still felt cautious about making love to your queen, but the longer you stayed interlocked with her and Jon, the better everything felt.</p><p>The remainder of your night together was spent rolling into different positions and finding new ways to pleasure one another. Dany was the one to suggest a third partner, as she wanted to watch Jon under the touch of another person, but she hadn\u2019t expected to enjoy your company as much as she truly did.</p><p>You were allowed to stay in their chambers that night, curled in between your lord and your queen. Dany wrapped her arms around your center and Jon pressed himself flush to your chest. Jon and Dany shared a smile between them as you fell asleep. They were certainly going to invite you into their bed again.</p>",

You were a loyal guard to her, one of Jon\u2019s northsmen in fact. His faith in her was enough to convince you that she would be a suitable ruler of Westeros, though she currently resided in Winterfell. You were allowed into her room by the Unsullied that guarded the door. You stood at attention, hands folded behind your back.</p><p>Your queen smiled when she saw you, standing up and walking near to you. \u201c(Y/n), I\u2019m glad you came. I have a rather\u2026 unconventional proposition for you.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>You found yourself smiling in return. \u201cI would do anything for you, my queen. I\u2019ve known Jon since childhood, and you care so much for him. I trust you to guide my actions in a fit manner.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as you spoke but soon caressed your cheek with her gloved hand, stroking her thumb over your lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say that. Both that you trust me, and that you\u2019re so close with Jon. You see, we\u2019ve been searching for a third.\u201d</p><p>Hot blush rose to your cheeks, brought on by both her words and her unnaturally warm touch. \u201cA third, your grace?\u201d Your voice lowered, confidence fading.</p><p>She adored the innocent expression on your face. \u201cA third person, to share our bed for a night. Or perhaps for far longer, if all goes well. Would you be interested in pleasing us tonight?\u201d Her hand trailed down your neck and shoulder. \u201cYou should know, you reserve the right to say no. My position as your superior should not move your choice one way or the other.\u201d Her tone turned more gentle as she explained your ability to say no.</p><p>You felt heat pool in your stomach, your one hands slightly shaky. \u201cI want to please you tonight. Both you and Jon.\u201d You hadn\u2019t admitted your interest in men to someone in a long while, but your queen had a right to know in this situation.</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI thought perhaps you had an interest in him. I always hoped you had one in me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly do.\u201d Your eyes scanned over her, taking in all the aspects of her body. \u201cMay I touch you, your grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you can drop the titles while we\u2019re together. Call me Dany.\u201d She said.</p><p>\u201cDany.\u201d You muttered as you moved to caress her side, moving closer.</p><p>You pressed a few small kisses against her neck, moving aside her braid. She let off a small hum, running her hands up your back. </p><p>The door to the bedroom opened. You pulled back from Dany to see Jon standing a few feet from both of you. A small grin flashed across his features as he looked to his queen. \u201cHe agreed?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, running her fingers through your hair. \u201cHe did, quite willingly in fact. He wants to be intimate with <i>both</i> of us. He seems to have kept in some pent up feelings for his lord.\u201d</p><p>You looked down shyly, nodding in affirmation. Jon stepped over to you, cupping your face with both his hands. He pulled you into a small kiss that lasted only mere seconds. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a certain fondness for him as well.\u201d He said smoothly.</p><p>Dany approached her lover, kissing down his bearded jaw. \u201cWe seem to all be in agreement. Any of us can stop at any time, or simply break if needed. Especially (y/n). We don\u2019t need an unhealthy power dynamic.\u201d She placed a hand on your back gingerly. \u201cDoes that sound good?\u201d</p><p>After you and Jon both agreed, you were led to their large bed. Jon started to undress Dany, but she paused and shot a playful look at you. \u201cDe-robe him first, I want to see both of you together.\u201d</p><p>Jon obliged without a second thought. He kissed you gently as he unlaced your tunic and pushed your undershirt down your shoulders. You instinctively started to remove Jon\u2019s clothing as well, feeing up his torso and chest once his clothes had fallen to the ground. Despite having yours closed as you kissed Jon, you could feel Danny\u2019s eyes on both of you. Jon rolled his tongue against yours, making you whine softly. When you had gotten each other\u2019s clothes off, you broke apart to notice Dany waiting for you, already stripped down on the bed. </p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t stop on account of me.\u201d She teased.</p><p>Jon chuckled and took your hand in his, leading you to the bed with him. He bent down and left a small peck on Dany\u2019s lips. \u201cHow should we go about this, love?\u201d </p><p>She reached up to run her finger\u2019s over Jon\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019d adore seeing you in (y/n)\u2019s lap, riding him.\u201d She gripped his dark hair, forcing a small groan from his throat. \u201cAnd then once you\u2019re settled, <i>I\u2019ll</i> ride <i>you</i>.\u201d She purred in a low tone.</p><p>You watched as Jon\u2019s eyes lit up, obviously turned on by his partner\u2019s idea. He turned to you, stroking his thumb over your knuckles. \u201cHow does that sound to you?\u201d</p><p>You felt a small surge of dominance run through your veins as you crawled near to him, pressing a rough kiss against his throat. \u201cI\u2019d love to watch you bounce on my length. Bet you\u2019d look so damn pretty. You wanna feel me filling you up.\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded rapidly. \u201cYes. Gods, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched that part of him in a while, he could use to be opened up first.\u201d Dany added.</p><p>You thought for a moment before coming up with a thought for a position.</p><p>You sat in the center of the bed, Jon folded at the waist as you opened him up, his head between Dany\u2019s thighs. You bent down to pepper small kisses across his back as slipped a second finger into his hole, scissoring them gently. He let out a moan agaisnt Dany before continuing to move his tongue across all the places that made her weak.</p><p>Dany shot you a sultry look. \u201cHe\u2019s probably almost ready. He likes a bit of burn.\u201d She gave Jon\u2019s hair a firm tug, making him whimper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here to guide me.\u201d You said with a small chuckle as you removed your fingers from your other partner.</p><p>Dany guided Jon into a sitting position, his mouth still slick from her wet. He locked into her eyes and licked his lips, making her grin at how dirty he could get. You helped Jon take you in, pushing into him inch my inch until you hit your hilt. He choked back a sob of a moan as he started to roll his hips agaisnt your cock. You kissed his neck and started to stroke his length. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so good, Jon. Isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d Dany nodded as she moved herself into his lap, kissing him long and slow.</p><p>You gave him a few more firm strokes before Dany slid herself down onto Jon, biting back a groan. </p><p>You rolled you hips so your tip would grind into Jon\u2019s prostate while Dany pleasured his front. Both of you sucked hickies into his neck, occasionally sharing a kiss yourself. You still felt cautious about making love to your queen, but the longer you stayed interlocked with her and Jon, the better everything felt.</p><p>The remainder of your night together was spent rolling into different positions and finding new ways to pleasure one another. Dany was the one to suggest a third partner, as she wanted to watch Jon under the touch of another person, but she hadn\u2019t expected to enjoy your company as much as she truly did.</p><p>You were allowed to stay in their chambers that night, curled in between your lord and your queen. Dany wrapped her arms around your center and Jon pressed himself flush to your chest. Jon and Dany shared a smile between them as you fell asleep. They were certainly going to invite you into their bed again.</p></p>",

He bent down and left a small peck on Dany&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;How should we go about this, love?&rdquo; </p><p>She reached up to run her finger&rsquo;s over Jon&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d adore seeing you in (y/n)&rsquo;s lap, riding him.&rdquo; She gripped his dark hair, forcing a small groan from his throat. &ldquo;And then once you&rsquo;re settled, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> ride <i>you</i>.&rdquo; She purred in a low tone.</p><p>You watched as Jon&rsquo;s eyes lit up, obviously turned on by his partner&rsquo;s idea. He turned to you, stroking his thumb over your knuckles. &ldquo;How does that sound to you?&rdquo;</p><p>You felt a small surge of dominance run through your veins as you crawled near to him, pressing a rough kiss against his throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to watch you bounce on my length. Bet you&rsquo;d look so damn pretty. You wanna feel me filling you up.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon nodded rapidly. &ldquo;Yes. Gods, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t touched that part of him in a while, he could use to be opened up first.&rdquo; Dany added.</p><p>You thought for a moment before coming up with a thought for a position.</p><p>You sat in the center of the bed, Jon folded at the waist as you opened him up, his head between Dany&rsquo;s thighs. You bent down to pepper small kisses across his back as slipped a second finger into his hole, scissoring them gently. He let out a moan agaisnt Dany before continuing to move his tongue across all the places that made her weak.</p><p>Dany shot you a sultry look. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably almost ready. He likes a bit of burn.&rdquo; She gave Jon&rsquo;s hair a firm tug, making him whimper.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here to guide me.&rdquo; You said with a small chuckle as you removed your fingers from your other partner.</p><p>Dany guided Jon into a sitting position, his mouth still slick from her wet. He locked into her eyes and licked his lips, making her grin at how dirty he could get. You helped Jon take you in, pushing into him inch my inch until you hit your hilt. He choked back a sob of a moan as he started to roll his hips agaisnt your cock. You kissed his neck and started to stroke his length. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing so good, Jon. Isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is.&rdquo; Dany nodded as she moved herself into his lap, kissing him long and slow.</p><p>You gave him a few more firm strokes before Dany slid herself down onto Jon, biting back a groan. </p><p>You rolled you hips so your tip would grind into Jon&rsquo;s prostate while Dany pleasured his front. Both of you sucked hickies into his neck, occasionally sharing a kiss yourself. You still felt cautious about making love to your queen, but the longer you stayed interlocked with her and Jon, the better everything felt.</p><p>The remainder of your night together was spent rolling into different positions and finding new ways to pleasure one another. Dany was the one to suggest a third partner, as she wanted to watch Jon under the touch of another person, but she hadn&rsquo;t expected to enjoy your company as much as she truly did.</p><p>You were allowed to stay in their chambers that night, curled in between your lord and your queen. Dany wrapped her arms around your center and Jon pressed himself flush to your chest. Jon and Dany shared a smile between them as you fell asleep. They were certainly going to invite you into their bed again.</p></p>",

        "body": "<p>Due to&hellip;recent events&hellip;I think it\u2019s important to\ngo back through George RR Martin\u2019s books and really understand what he was trying\nto say with Daenerys Targaryen. She occupies the same space in the narrative\nthat Jon Snow does, where she\u2019s just stereotypical enough, just fantasy trope\nenough, that people take for granted who her character is and what she\nrepresents. But, like Jon, if you read her chapters with an open mind, you\u2019ll\nnotice all of these great subversions and character traits that you miss the\nfirst time.</p><p>Breaking down the journey she takes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, GRRM lays a lot of\ntracks for where the story will take her&hellip; </p><p><b>The Outsider</b></p><p>The first thing about Daenerys is that she is\ninstantly an outsider. GRRM loves writing outsiders, and a huge amount of the\nPOV\u2019s in book one are introduced as an outsider in some way; Jon being a\nbastard in a society driven by status, Arya as a tomboy in a patriarchal\nsociety, Sansa as someone who doesn\u2019t fit with her family, Tyrion as a dwarf in\nan ableist society, and so on. Daenerys takes this concept to its extreme; not\nonly is she an outsider within her own world, she is an outsider within the\nnarrative. All the POVs we\u2019ll have in this book were the victors of Robert\u2019s\nRebellion. They may have lost things (like Ned losing Lyanna) but Robert\u2019s\nRebellion worked for them in a way that they either ended up better off than\nbefore, or received some form of justice for the wrongs they\u2019d suffered.\u00a0</p><p>But\nDaenerys <i>lost</i>. She was supposed to be\na Princess, to grow up in the Red Keep with an entire kingdom at her feet. Instead, we are introduced to a young girl who hasn\u2019t truly known a home her\nwhole life, a girl who thinks she was chased around a continent by assassins\nout to take her life. We know, because we\u2019ve lived inside Eddard Stark\u2019s head,\nthat Daenerys\u2019 family was unequivocally on the wrong side of Robert\u2019s\nRebellion, but suddenly we understand that even in a just war, innocent people\nwill get ruined.</p><p>So, with Daenerys being the lone Targaryen POV we\nhave, it creates a sort of dissonance where she is portrayed as sympathetic,\nyet is the natural enemy to the Starks who are our heroes. When her brother\nViserys tells her these awful stories of \u201c<i>the Usurper and his dogs</i>\u201d, we know\nshe\u2019s being lied to because we know Eddard Stark, but yet we have to sympathize\nwith this child who was supposed to have everything and, instead, was left with\nnothing. Like Tyrion, we as a reader don\u2019t quite know how to feel about her,\nbecause she is the antagonist of our heroes, but when you see things from her\nperspective suddenly this black and white war turns into a hundred different\nshades of grey. </p><!-- more --><p><b>The House With The Red Door</b></p><p>Moving from what her existence means to the narrative,\nwe begin to understand what Robert\u2019s Rebellion did to her as a person. The\nfirst we see of her, she is feeling a dress so soft it scares her, as her\nbrother Viserys tells her she must look like a princess:</p><blockquote><p><i>A\nPrincess</i>, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like.\nPerhaps she had never really known.</p></blockquote><p>For the first time in her life, she\u2019s starting to get\na real taste of what she lost as a child, and she\u2019s scared. It becomes clear\nthat Viserys is an abuser in her life, and seeing him so fevered is terrifying.\nFor the first time in his life, he\u2019s been given a clear path to reclaim the\nSeven Kingdoms and the Iron Throne that by rights should be his. Viserys was old\nenough to remember Dragonstone and King\u2019s Landing and the throne he lost; these\nare all tangible things that he can remember, that he knows someone stole from\nhim.</p><p>But Daenerys doesn\u2019t have that connection to Westeros.\nShe wasn\u2019t even born when her mother retreated to Dragonstone, and just a baby\nwhen Willem Darry smuggled her and her brother to Essos. Home is a very loose\nconcept that Daenerys can never firmly grasp because she never truly had one.\nShe understands that she was never allowed to just be a child, but she can\u2019t\nplace where it all went wrong. Viserys has this clear line, when he was 8 and a\nPrince and had everything; then suddenly everyone he knew was dead and he had\nnothing. Daenerys doesn\u2019t have that; all she has is this memory of a house with\na red door.</p><p>This house with the red door is so important to her,\nbecause it is the closest she has ever gotten to home; the one place she can\nlook back on and feel like she had what she was supposed to:</p><blockquote><p>She remembered Ser Willem\ndimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders\nfrom his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always\nbeen kind to Dany. He called her \u201cLittle Princess\u201d and sometime \u201cMy Lady,\u201d&hellip;\nThat was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany\nhad her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. </p></blockquote><p>Yet, Daenerys knows that wasn\u2019t really her home,\njust the closest she has come. Her character will chase that feeling, of being\nsafe and in control and having things, for the rest of the books. The house\nwith the red door works so well as a writing device from GRRM, because it is this\nvague idea of a thing; from the beginning it is clear that Daenerys herself\ndoesn\u2019t really understand why this house with a red door appeals so much to\nher, so she can never get that feeling back. From the start, Daenerys is\nchasing this thing that we know she can never have. What she does when <i>she</i>\nrealizes that, is a question for later books.</p><p>But what, from a Doylist perspective, is this house\nwith a red door supposed to be? Daenerys thinks it is home, but the symbolism\nof this house is childhood and innocence. The things Daenerys remembers fondly\nabout it are important; Ser Willem calling her \u201cprincess\u201d, the lemon tree,\nhaving her own room. The first is very important, because being a princess is\nwhat Viserys has filled her head with \u2013 it\u2019s the childhood Daenerys knows she\nwas owed by blood. The lemon tree is a bit more complicated; <i>A Dance With\nDragons</i> will really start breaking down Daenerys and trees and all the imagery\nthat goes with her arc, but trees is what Dany <i>wants</i> to want. To watch the lemon tree grow, is to spend years in\nthe same place. And trees also need peace to grow; you have to love and care\nfor a lemon tree. Having her own room also means that Daenerys was well off. Safe, comfortable, and well-off princesses have their own room with a lemon\ntree outside. So while the house with the red door represents childhood and\ninnocence, I also think it\u2019s important to recognize that it also represents\nDany\u2019s longing for her life of royalty. She doesn\u2019t have the same murderous\nvengeance as Viserys, but she has that same passion for what was taken from\nher; a sort of blinding desire that gets in the way of seeing things clearly,\nespecially when it comes to understanding that the Iron Throne wasn\u2019t stolen\nfrom her family \u2013 they murdered it away chasing dragons. </p><p>Speaking of Daenerys\u2019 connection to home, there is some interesting symbolism at play when\nDaenerys visits the markets. Daenerys loves the\nsights and smells of the Eastern market, the excitement of trying and seeing\nnew things, experiencing something foreign. But she turns toward the\nWestern market because it smells of home. When she was younger and went to the\nbazaar with Viserys, they hardly ever had enough money to buy anything but a\ncertain type of sausage that Daenerys remembers fondly. She finds it again with\nher handmaidens and <i>khas</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThey taste different than I remember,\u201d Dany said\nafter her first few bites.</p><p>\u201cIn Pentos, I make them with pork,\u201d the old woman\nsaid, \u201cbut all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea. These are made of horsemeat,\nKhaleesi, but I spice them the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dany felt disappointed</p></blockquote><p>Something is lost on the Dothraki sea, and home will\nnever be the same again.</p><p><b>She Forgot To Be Afraid</b></p><p>The header has a hopeful sound to it, and the tail end\nof Dany\u2019s first chapters do as well, but the first part of her story is\nincredibly bleak. Fear is such a heavy element in Dany\u2019s story, partially\nbecause it really sets up the decisions she\u2019ll make in her final chapters, but\nmostly because it is the reason for her character growth. Once Dany finds her\nplace and begins leading as a Khaleesi, we start to see her true personality\ncome out and she is a person again. But for the first few chapters, Dany has\nalmost none of the character traits that later define her, because fear has\nsuppressed them. Living under Viserys as she grew up, constantly dancing around\nhis \u201cdragon\u201d, she had no space to be the bold, fierce, avenging girl she ends <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i> as. A couple of her traits really shine through in these first\nchapters, like how much more intelligent and perceptive she is compared to\nViserys and some of the adults around her, because her others characteristics\nhave been put on hold; but it\u2019s really just tragic to read about Dany\u2019s life up\nto this point. Viserys has lied to her (unintentionally, since he is\ndelusional, but\u2026) and made her think she\u2019s only been one step ahead of\nassassins her whole life, and then turned around and abused her for things out\nof her control (like her mother Rhaella dying in childbirth, or how he sold\ntheir mother\u2019s crown to feed her):</p><blockquote><p>His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts\nand tightened on a nipple. \u201cYou will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go\nhard for you. You don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d His fingers twisted\nher, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal\nDrogo\u2019s army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for\nthat, you will.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d let his whole <i>khalasar</i> fuck you if need\nbe, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what\nit took to get my army. Be grateful it is only Drogo.</p></blockquote><p>The picture this paints of what Viserys has been like\nto Daenerys for years now is shocking (later books will also elaborate that\nViserys tried to rape her in the days after this, but Ilyrio\u2019s men stopped\nhim). And like I said earlier, the way Dany has to avoid waking his dragon\nconsumes all of her mental energy. Between trying not to anger him, and longing\nfor days before he became so cruel, there simply isn\u2019t anymore left Dany can\ngive.</p><p><b>The Blood of the Dragon</b></p><p>From the very first chapter, Viserys introduces us to\na core concept of GRRM\u2019s world, and for lack of a better name, I\u2019d call it\nTargaryen entitlement. Even after Viserys dies demanding he be crowned in <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i>, we aren\u2019t even close to understanding the full reach of\nTargaryens overstepping in the name of themselves.<i> Fire and Blood Volume I</i>\nshows us that Aegon conquered a whole continent to get his relative a girl,\nwhether she wanted him or no. That\u2019s the kind of history standing behind\nViserys when he threatens Dany with Drogo\u2019s <i>khalasar</i>.</p><p>But for now, Viserys is our look inside what led to\nthe implosion of the Targaryen dynasty, and it\u2019s not pretty:</p><blockquote><p>The dragon does not beg</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You do not command the dragon</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon speaks as he likes</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon is not mocked</p></blockquote><p>And Daenerys\u2019 inner monologue gives some context as to\nwhy \u201cthe dragon\u201d sees himself as so far above the rest:</p><blockquote><p>Dragons did not mate with\nthe beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of\nlesser men.</p></blockquote><p>Later books and the extended canon will elaborate on\nthis concept further, as we learn the Targaryens are quite literally the blood\nof the dragon (which is why their severe inbreeding leads to dragon/human\nhybrid babies); but the important thing here is that Viserys views himself as a\nGod amongst men, a majestic beast unfit to mingle with the sheep. This god\ncomplex gives us an understanding of why the Targaryens act the way they do,\nthough; when you\u2019re so high above everyone else, their lives start to matter\nless and less. </p><p>The idea that Targaryens are inherently better than\neveryone else, drives Viserys as much as his own victimization does:</p><blockquote><p>Ours by blood right&hellip;You do not steal from the\ndragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers</p></blockquote><p>Viserys\u2019 language is filled with quotes like this. While\nhe does talk of getting revenge for his brother Rhaegar, or killing the usurper\nwho sits on his father\u2019s throne, an equal amount of his anger is focused on\nbeing a dragon. Not only did the Usurper take what belonged to him, but he\ndared to think himself equal to a dragon. </p><p>And Daenerys does not seem particularly interested in\neither of these things:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cPlease, <i>please</i>,\nViserys, I don\u2019t want to, I want to go home.\u201d&hellip;Dany had only meant their\nrooms in Illyrio\u2019s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother\ndid not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house\nwith the red door had not been home for him.</p></blockquote><p>From the beginning, Dany has found strength in being\nDaenerys Targaryen, but not in the way Viserys did. She is empowered by it because\nit gives her a sense of identity; even though she doesn\u2019t have a real home or\nreal friends or anybody, she knows who she is. Daenerys Stormborn of the House\nTargaryen is not meaningless, she is important; and Dany needs that to hold\nonto. Her last name cost her so much, but it\u2019s also what keeps her going.</p><p>Once her relationship with Viserys starts to fall\napart, Daenerys\u2019 relationship to being a Targaryen starts to change. When\nDaenerys embraces the <i>khalasar</i>, she suddenly becomes very powerful; as long as\nKhal Drogo is alive, all the men must follow her commands or risk their Khal\u2019s\nwrath. And being Khaleesi also gives Daenerys a certain sense of place; it\u2019s\nnever going to be home to her, but she belongs there much more than she\u2019s ever\nbelonged anywhere else. She fully begins to embrace their customs by dressing\nas they do, learning to speak Dothraki, and respecting their sacred beliefs. For\nthe first time in many years she feels comfortable, and she can\u2019t understand why\nViserys won\u2019t at least try and join her. The more Dany finds a place for\nherself, the more determined Viserys is to demean and reject the Dothraki.\nWhere Dany is enjoying their travels to Vaes Dothrak and wouldn\u2019t mind staying\nwith the Dothraki for any number of days before sailing to Westeros, Viserys\npushes and pushes to get what he bought with Dany\u2019s marriage. He has no interest\nin living with the Dothraki, much less wearing their clothes and speaking their\nlanguage. This divide between them finally allows Dany to see Viserys for what\nhe truly is:</p><blockquote><p>He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful\nthing. Why had she never seen that before? There was a hollow place inside her\nwhere her fear had been.</p></blockquote><p>And seeing him for the pitiful man he\u2019s always been\nstarts to reshape how Daenerys sees herself. Like almost everyone from\nWesteros, Daenerys believes very strongly in two things: hereditary monarchy and\nthe divine right of the Targaryen dynasty. Yet she sees Viserys, who by both\nthose measures is the rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, and understands he\ndoesn\u2019t deserve it:</p><blockquote><p>Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. \u201cTruth\nnow. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?\u201d</p><p>Dany thought about that. \u201cHe would not be a very good\nking, would he?\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cMy brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d\nDany said. She had known that for a long time, she realized. She had known it\nall her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a whisper,\nbut now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear.</p><p>Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. &ldquo;You think not.&rdquo;</p><p>\u201cHe could not lead an army even if my lord husband\ngave him one,\u201d Dany said. \u201cHe has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles\nhim as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. He will never\ntake us home\u201d. </p></blockquote><p>Before I continue, there is one thing I want to emphasize\n\u2013 Daenerys <i>never</i> gives up on her\nbrother. David Benioff and Dan Weiss trying to paint his death as a moral\nturning point for Daenerys is simply not true. She does put him in his place,\nlike when she takes his horse away from him, but those are not bad things; he\nphysically abuses her, and she removes him from her space by having him at the back\nof the <i>khalasar</i>. It was a logical and reasonable punishment for his behavior,\nespecially because as Khaleesi she could have had him killed for it. Up until\nhe tries to cut her child out of her, Dany never considers harming him and\ntries very hard to make him see reason. Even though she feels incredibly close\nto her dragon eggs, she offers them to Viserys as a last chance to make him\nhappy and to save his life.</p><p>While she didn\u2019t give up on him as her brother, she\ndid give up on him as her King:</p><blockquote><p>When her son sat the Iron Throne, she would see that\nhe had bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his\nKingsguard.</p></blockquote><p>I wish GRRM spent more time elaborating on this quote\nof Dany\u2019s, because it\u2019s fairly revolutionary. We know from being in Dany\u2019s head\nthat she has no intention of harming or killing Viserys; and yet, she sees her\nson sitting on the Iron Throne. Does she just assume he will do something\nstupid to get him killed on the way? Or has she removed him from the line of\nsuccession because he\u2019s a vicious idiot? I\u2019d like to know more on what Dany\u2019s\nhead space is at that moment. </p><p>It becomes very clear what her thoughts are once he\ndies, though:</p><blockquote><p><i>He\nwas no dragon</i>, Dany thought, curiously calm. <i>Fire cannot kill a dragon</i></p></blockquote><p>Because Daenerys believes in the monarchy and in the\ndivine right of Targaryens, she has to find a way to square Viserys being the \u201crightful\u201d\nKing and also being a monster she won\u2019t put on the Iron Throne. And the concept\nof being a \u201cdragon\u201d is how she does it. Viserys constantly called himself one,\nand Ser Jorah Mormont said her brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and once\nViserys dies Dany realizes she is the dragon. Of course, everyone else was\nusing \u201cthe dragon\u201d in more metaphorical terms, but it becomes clear a little\nlater in the story that Daenerys is much more literally a dragon. Viserys\u2019\ndeath is the first time we see Daenerys fully commit to who she is, the blood\nof the dragon. She rejects Viserys\u2019 version of her family and starts seeing\nherself and her son as the future of House Targaryen.</p><p>Part of her really starting to embrace herself as\nbeing the blood of the dragon, is because she wants to go home to Westeros:</p><blockquote><p>But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King\u2019s\nLanding and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built. It was\nDragonstone where she had been born. In her mind\u2019s eye, they burned with a\nthousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind\u2019s eye, all the\ndoors were red</p></blockquote><p>Before, when it was Viserys forcing Westeros on her,\nshe never wanted it. But being Khaleesi, Dany realizes that she does want what\nher family lost:</p><blockquote><p><i>If\nI were not the blood of the dragon</i>, she thought wistfully, <i>this could be my home</i>. She was khaleesi,\nshe had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve her, warriors to keep\nher safe, an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old.\n. . and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world. That\nshould be enough for any woman&hellip; but not for the dragon. With Viserys gone,\nDaenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and conquerors,\nand so too the child inside her. She must not forget. </p></blockquote><p>This is where some of Daenerys less charming qualities\nare coming out, as far as why and how she wants to take back the Seven\nKingdoms. Wanting power or having it are not inherently bad things, but the\nproblems start to show in how Daenerys wants to gain it. Her urge to conquer\nWesteros is explicitly tied to being Daenerys Targaryen; she wants to reclaim\nit in the name of \u201ckings and conquerors\u201d. There is no way to remove Daenerys\nfrom the long history of abuses Westeros had to suffer under Kings like Aegon\nthe Conqueror, Maegor the Cruel, Aegon the Unworthy, The Mad King Aerys, etc,\nbecause Daenerys is coming for the Iron Throne in their name. She\u2019s not just\nrelated to them, they are what drive her forward. Later books, and especially <i>A\nDance with Dragons</i>, will dive much more into what Fire &amp; Blood means to\nWesteros and Dany, but even in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> there is attention brought to the\nbloody history of House Targaryen. This passage also starts drawing attention\nto the two different people she is; there is Dany, who is a young girl eager\nfor home and love and happiness and belonging, then there is Daenerys Stormborn\nof the House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the\nCruel and old Valyria before them, the dragon\u2019s daughter. </p><p><b>Daughter of Dragons, Bride of Dragons, Mother\nof Dragons</b></p><p>Beyond Daenerys\u2019 familial connection to her house, there\nis a strong magical link to Daenerys and her dragons. Even though they aren\u2019t\nborn until the final chapter, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> really highlights the\nconnection she has to them. She receives her three eggs as a gift at her\nwedding to Khal Drogo:</p><blockquote><p>Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she\nhad ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors\nthat at first she thought they were crusted with jewels</p></blockquote><p>Right after this, Khal Drogo gifts her Dany\u2019s silver,\nwhich she rides and for the first time isn\u2019t afraid. There is a connection\ndrawn between Dany receiving her dragon eggs, and then receiving a mount she finally\nfeels comfortable on. For now, Dany will have to ride her silver, but soon her\ndragons will be her mount. </p><p>The parallels between Daenerys and her dragons are already\nvery clear as well. When she first gets her eggs, they are beautiful but\nseemingly dead; hard and lifeless stone nobody expects to hatch. Similarly,\nDaenerys is overlooked by those around her in favor of her brother Viserys, and she\u2019s seemingly dormant. She doesn\u2019t have any ambitions to cross the Narrow Sea and\ntake back the Iron Throne, and nobody is investing in her future. But instantly\nDaenerys feels something within the hard stone, and keeps them with her almost\nalways.</p><p>When she\u2019s at her lowest of lows on the Dothraki sea,\nat the height of Drogo\u2019s abuse and her feeling lost and unloved, it\u2019s the\ndragons that bring her back from the edge:</p><blockquote><p>Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon\ndream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There was only her and the\ndragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood,\nDany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth,\nthe flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her. She\nopened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it\ncleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear\nand blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and\nyet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce.</p></blockquote><p>After that dream, her chaffed thighs start to heal and\nshe can ride her silver much better than before. Mentally she also finds a new\nstrength and is able to keep going, which leads to her embracing the Dothraki.\nShe is able to draw actual strength from the eggs, and in return they also find\nstrength in her:</p><blockquote><p>She touched one, the largest of the three, running her\nhand lightly over the shell. <i>Black-and-scarlet</i>,\nshe thought, <i>like the dragon in my dream</i>.\nThe stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers&hellip; or was she still\ndreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously. </p></blockquote><p>As Dany starts to come into her own, her dragon eggs\nbegin heating up. Both her and her dragons are starting to wake up. And as the\nbook continues, Dany begins associating herself with dragons and as a dragon\nmore and more; first when Viserys dies, then when Robert sends assassins after\nher, and again when she is claiming the Lhazareen women as her slaves:</p><blockquote><p><i>The\nUsurper has woken the dragon now</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As she grows more comfortable being the dragon, her\neggs slowly get closer and closer to coming alive and Daenerys feels called to\nthem:</p><blockquote><p>Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to\nthe fire and pushed it down amongst the burning coals. The black scales seemed\nto glow as they drank the heat. Flames licked against the stone with small red\ntongues. Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire. As\nshe stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled in her throat.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys also has dreams of literally becoming a\ndragon:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she\nfelt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the\nshadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The door loomed before her, the\nred door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding\nbehind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high\nand higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in\nterror from the shadow of her wings</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys being pregnant with her son also offers a lot\nof insight into what her future is as the last dragon. All of the prophecies\nand foreshadowing surrounding Rhaego are actually about Daenerys, and it\u2019s the\nstart of her destiny being intertwined with the beautiful horror of dragons:</p><blockquote><p>She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt\nthe child move within her \u2026 as if he were reaching out, brother to brother,\nblood to blood. &ldquo;You are the dragon,&rdquo; Dany whispered to him,\n&ldquo;the true dragon. I know it. I know it.&rdquo; And she smiled, and went to\nsleep dreaming of home.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cAs swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his\n<i>khalasar</i> covers the earth, men without number, with <i>arakhs</i> shining in their\nhands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies\nwill tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend\ntheir flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk\nmen in the stone tents will fear his name.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The first quote really affirms Daenerys\u2019 role in the story\nas the true dragon, the last dragon. In <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, as well as in <i>A\nStorm of Swords</i> and <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>, Daenerys has dreams of turning into\nRhaegar; while fandom argues what this means and there is plenty of different\nmeanings it could have, I personally believe the foreshadowing is that Daenerys\nis the last dragon. Many times in the story that role is given to Rhaegar, but\nwe see with Daenerys that she is more a dragon than he ever was.</p><p>The second quote is the prophecy given to Daenerys by\nthe <i>Dosh Khaleen</i> in Vaes Dothrak, where they name her son <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>. This prophecy is obviously about\nDaenerys; the Dosh Khaleen assumed the future they were seeing belonged to her\nson, but they were actually seeing Daenerys\u2019 own future. Rhaego dying makes it\nquite clear, but the prophecy referring to the Stallion Who Mounts the World as\n\u201c<i>fierce as a storm</i>\u201d really seals the deal; after all she is Daenerys <b>Stormborn</b>,\nnamed after the storm that destroyed her family\u2019s fleet. This prophecy is extremely\nominous, with lines like \u201c<i>His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will\nweep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief</i>\u201d and \u201c<i>milk men in the stone\ntents will fear his name</i>\u201d; this does not sound like Daenerys is going to be\nliberating Westeros (the \u201cstone tents\u201d is a reference to castles). The name this\n\u201cprince\u201d is given, <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>, is also very similar to\nanother prophecy of Martin\u2019s \u2013 the rape of Westeros Daenerys sees in the House\nof the Undying. The language used to describe how the Stallion comes to mount\nthe world is bloody and violent; wives crying for their husbands, men living in\nfear, etc. It\u2019s a very concerning look into the future.</p><p><b>If I Look Back I Am Lost</b></p><p>A lot of people had problems with <i>Game of Thrones\u2019</i>\ndepiction of Daenerys in s8, based on the idea that her dark turn came out of\nnowhere. And in no way am I defending the show\u2019s characterization of her, or\nthe portrayal of her dark turn, but a lot of that criticism has gotten carried\nover to Daenerys as she stands in GRRM\u2019s books, which is simply not true.\nDaenerys has struggled with darkness her entire arc, and it really comes to the\nforefront in her last several <i>A Game of Thrones</i> chapters.</p><p>The Dothraki raid of the Lhazareen village is a huge\nturning point for Daenerys. Once Robert attempts to have her assassinated, Dany\nis finally able to convince Khal Drogo to sail across the Narrow Sea and take\nthe Iron Throne for her and her son. To do this, the Khalasar attack a peaceful\nvillage and a rival <i>khalasar</i>, and it\u2019s Dany\u2019s first real look at what her war\nfor the Iron Throne will be like:</p><blockquote><p>Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the\nrye and lentils into the ground, while <i>arakhs</i> and arrows had sown a terrible\nnew crop and watered it with blood.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys see\u2019s Khal Drogo\u2019s men herding a young boy,\nteasing him until they get bored of the game and cut his head off. The men are\nalso raping women atop piles of their dead people, and it\u2019s sickening to her:</p><blockquote><p>It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them;\nshe remembered what terror felt like.</p></blockquote><p>As she continues to walk through the Dothraki\u2019s\ndestruction, she tries to steel herself to the horrors around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>I\nam the blood of the dragon</i>, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself\nas she turned her face away. She pressed her lips together and hardened her\nheart and rode on toward the gate.</p></blockquote><p>But as she realizes their captives will be sold into\nslavery, she breaks:</p><blockquote><p><i>Slaves</i>,\nDany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver\u2019s\nBay. She wanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. <i>This is war, this is what it looks like,\nthis is the price of the Iron Throne</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Notice what GRRM calls her here; in the first quote\nwhen she is able to harden her heart and ride forward she is \u201cDaenerys\nTargaryen\u201d, but in the second when she almost begins to cry GRRM softens and\ncalls her \u201cDany\u201d. I\u2019ll get into it more below, but Daenerys is constantly at\nodds with herself and those are the two versions of her. Remember when I said\nthe lemon tree is what Dany wants to want? There is a part of her that craves\nthat simplicity, but life keeps pushing and pulling her towards that other part\nof her, the blood of the dragon, the seed of kings and conquerors, the part of\nher that is Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.</p><p>But in this moment, Daenerys Targaryen loses. Dany,\nthe part of her that remembers what it\u2019s like to be terrified, to be a slave,\ndecides to turn back:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending\nsound, a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on. Dany\u2019s hand clenched\nhard around the reins, and she turned the silver\u2019s head. \u201cMake them stop,\u201d she commanded\nSer Jorah.</p></blockquote><p>Notice how this passage starts: <i>Behind them</i>. Daenerys has to <i>look\nback</i> to save Eroeh. By the end of this book, Daenerys has made \u201c<i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>\u201d into her life philosophy, and it\u2019s heartbreaking. Her last\ncouple of chapters tell the story of a good-hearted person trying to help\npeople and fix the mistake she\u2019s made, yet when it all goes south she learns\nall the wrong lessons. </p><p>When Daenerys tries to claim these women to save them,\nshe does it with all the naivety of a 14yo girl. We shouldn\u2019t expect her to\nknow what to do in these situations; she\u2019s a young girl and she has a very\nsimple understanding of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and more importantly she\nhas a very simple understanding of what is and isn\u2019t a slave. </p><p>One of the women she saves in this town is Mirri Maz\nDuur:</p><blockquote><p>They passed other women being raped. Each time Dany\nreined up, sent her <i>khas</i> to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave.\nOne of them, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany\nhaltingly in the Common Tongue. </p></blockquote><p>Mirri is the only woman who says thank you to Dany,\nwhereas the others are terrified that Dany has spared them for something worse.\nSo, when Mirri speaks up that she can help Khal Drogo, Dany stands up for her\nagainst the Dothraki and allows her to help him. The mental processes of Mirri\nMaz Duur are still actually very unclear, and I know a lot of people argue over\nwhen she decided what she was going to do and even what she actually did. But\nto me, it seems heavily implied that Mirri\u2019s original efforts were made in good\nfaith. Khal Drogo falls ill because he disregards every single one of Mirri\u2019s\ninstructions by ripping her poultice off, smearing his wound in mud, and\ndrinking wine and milk of the poppy heavily. When Dany calls Mirri to look at\nhim again, she instantly knows Drogo has ignored her:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dany admitted.</p><p>\u201cI made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and\nbound it in a lambskin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned, he said. He tore it off. The herbwomen\nmade him a new one, wet and soothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned, yes. There is great healing magic in fire,\neven your hairless men know that.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Mirri seems very genuine here, and lays out that Drogo\nignored everything she told him. It doesn\u2019t make logical sense that she could have\ndone this to him, considering he ripped her poultice off almost immediately and\npreceded to do all the things she told him not to. I think Mirri made a genuine\nattempt to help Drogo, either altruistically or as an attempt to gain favor\nwith her new master (Dany), and then is completely ignored, which seems to\nupset her. What also upsets her, is that Dany owns her:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou do not ask a slave,\u201d Mirri replied sharply, \u201cyou\ntell her.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As we progress further, I really want to encourage\nreaders to remember Mirri\u2019s perspective in this story. I won\u2019t dive too deep\ninto her motivations, because this is about Dany and Mirri really deserves a\nmeta of her own, but understanding her is key to understanding what GRRM is\ntrying to say at the climax of Dany\u2019s arc. Remember that Dany threw the first\npunch between them, and while Dany did try to help Mirri, Mirri tried equally\nto help Dany and Drogo and had her efforts thrown back in her face. </p><p>And while Mirri Maz Duur is entirely misleading at\npoints, she never lies to Dany and she tries to talk Dany out of it:</p><blockquote><p>Mirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied\nDaenerys through eyes as black as night. \u201cThere is a spell.\u201d Her voice was\nquiet, scarcely more than a whisper. \u201cBut it is hard, lady, and dark. Some\nwould say that death is cleaner. I learned the way in Asshai, and paid dear for\nthe lesson. My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The first time Dany thinks to herself \u201c<i>If I look back\nI am lost</i>\u201d, is when Mirri tells her she knew that the price to pay was Rhaego\nand did it anyway. I\u2019ve seen it argued that this is unclear or false, but I\ncompletely disagree. This quote here is evidence enough:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cDeath?\u201d Dany wrapped her arms around herself\nprotectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. \u201cMy death?\u201d She told herself\nshe would die for him, if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would\nnot be afraid. </p></blockquote><p>Dany dying for Drogo would certainly lead to Rhaego\u2019s\ndeath as well, since the sacrifice needs to happen before the night is done and\nDany has no thoughts of going into labor. This quote makes it even clearer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mirri Maz Duur promised. \u201cNot your death, Khaleesi.\u201d\n</p><p>Dany trembled with relief. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>She agrees before Mirri tells her what the sacrifice\nis. Dany would have given up anything in that moment to save Khal Drogo. </p><p>Like I said earlier, she\nis still a very young girl here and doesn\u2019t have any reason to be able to\nhandle the weight that\u2019s been placed on her. But she gets incredibly focused on\nDrogo once he falls sick, and her care and compassion for anyone else seems to\ndisappear:</p><blockquote><p>Eroeh stared fearfully at\nDrogo where he lay. \u201cHe dies,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Dany slapped her.</p></blockquote><p>Eroeh is the girl\nDaenerys saw gang raped atop a pile of corpses, the girl who\u2019s wails turned Dany\naround. </p><p>After everything goes so\nhorribly wrong, when Drogo\u2019s men turn against her and Jorah brings her into the\ntent with Mirri and she loses Rhaego and Drogo and wakes up with nothing, Mirri\ntells her this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI spoke for you,\u201d she\nsaid, anguished. \u201cI saved you.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Saved</i> me?\u201d The Lhazareen woman spat. \u201cThree riders had taken me,\nnot as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth\nwas in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god\u2019s house\nburn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well,\nand in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my\nbread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons\npast. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips.\nTell me again what you saved.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour life.\u201d </p><p>Mirri Maz Duur laughed\ncruelly. \u201cLook to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is\ngone.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Mirri obviously makes\nsome morally dubious decisions, but there is a lot of truth in what she tells\nDaenerys. What Dany viewed as saving, Mirri sees as a pitiful gesture; the damage\nwas already done before Dany changed her mind, and she didn\u2019t see or understand\nthat. If Daenerys was in a more understanding mindset, Mirri has a great lesson\nto teach her about how you treat people, especially your slaves (because yes,\nMirri is Dany\u2019s slave). </p><p>That\u2019s not the lesson\nDany learns though, she learns <i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>; which is a callback to a passage from her earlier chapters:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them the great\nhorde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking\ndust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant</p></blockquote><p>Deciding not to look back\nis a decision Dany makes so she doesn\u2019t have to face the reality of her choices\nand mistakes. Everything is okay if she doesn\u2019t turn back, if she doesn\u2019t see\nthe way her actions sow a crop of blood in the soil. But like I said, Dany\u2019s\nbest moments come when she looks behind her. If she didn\u2019t look back for Eroeh,\nshe would have left women to be raped and sold into slavery. Especially when we\nget to <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and<i> A Dance with Dragons</i>, it\u2019s just so clear that\nlooking back is essential to Dany\u2019s morality. She tries not to through those\nbooks, but she can\u2019t stop herself. Yet every time she does, she hates it. She\nhates that she saved Mirri Maz Duur and cost herself so much in the process. That\u2019s\nwhy she tells herself <i>If I look back I am\nlost</i>, to remember to never look back again. </p><p><b>Waking the Dragon</b></p><p>This is the climax of\nDany\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>; everything in her chapters is leading her to\nthe moment she steps into Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre. From her first chapter, she\ndreams of her dragons:</p><blockquote><p><i>There\nare no more dragons</i>, Dany thought, staring at her brother,\nthough she did not dare say it aloud.</p><p>Yet that night she dreamt\nof one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear.\nShe ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again.\nShe stumbled and fell. \u201cYou woke the dragon,\u201d he screamed as he kicked her. \u201cYou\nwoke the dragon, you woke the dragon.\u201d Her thighs were slick with blood. She\nclosed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping\nsound and the <i>crackling</i> of some great\nfire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all\naround, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head\nslowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a\nfine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid&hellip;</p></blockquote><p>Her next dream has a much\nmore positive feel, but carries the same language:</p><blockquote><p>She opened her arms to\nthe fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper\nher and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough\naway, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam</p></blockquote><p>This dream really reminds\nme of GRRM\u2019s inspiration for his title, <i>Fire and Ice</i> by Robert Frost:</p><blockquote><p>Some say the world will\nend in fire/Some say in ice/From what I\u2019ve tasted of desire/I hold with those\nwho favor fire</p></blockquote><p>When Dany is in Mirri\u2019s\ntent, her dreams start to take on a very ominous tone:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain\nripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of\nburning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The\ndoor loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur\naround her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew\nacross the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all\nthat lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings</p><p>\u2026</p><p>She woke to the taste of\nashes.</p></blockquote><p>The progression of her\ndreams tell an interesting story. At first, when Daenerys wants no part of\nViserys\u2019 dreams or the Seven Kingdoms, the dragon in her dream terrifies her\nand she wakes more scared than she\u2019s ever been. But when the dream comes to her\non the Dothraki sea, after she\u2019s received her eggs as a wedding gift, she\nembraces the dragon in her dream; lets the fire mold and shape her, burn away\nher fear and hurt. And when she\u2019s fever dreaming in Mirri\u2019s tent, she takes the\nnext step and becomes the dragon; flying over Westeros, chasing the red door. As\nDany progresses through <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, she slowly embraces the dragon until\nshe is ready to hatch them in her final chapter.</p><p>What\u2019s most interesting\nis the framing of what that means. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that we are\nintroduced to the concept of \u201c<i>waking the dragon</i>\u201d through Viserys\u2019 threats to\nDaenerys. From the first chapter, we\u2019re meant to understand that waking the\ndragon is really bad for Daenerys. She tries her hardest <i>not</i> to wake the dragon, because something very bad will happen to\nher if she does. And her first dream of the dragon from her second chapter\nfeeds into this narrative; the dragon seeks to burn her.</p><p>In her second dream, she\nis much more comfortable standing before the dragon; but it\u2019s important to realize\nthat nothing has changed in the structure of the dream. Her dragon still wants\nto burn her, but now she finds strength in that; let this dragon burn away her\nweakness and temper her strength. She\u2019s starting to grow closer to her eggs,\nand also more comfortable with her heritage. Being with the Dothraki stripped her\nof everything except herself, and she\u2019s starting to fall back on that for strength.</p><p>A lot of time passes before\nshe has her last and final dream before hatching her dragons, and the tone has\nnow changed. She isn\u2019t standing before the dragon; she is the dragon. In her\ndream, she hears Viserys saying \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d\nand as she dreams it slowly falls away until all she hears is \u201cwake the dragon\u201d.\nThrough her travels on the Dothraki Sea, she\u2019s gone from a scared girl cowering\nbefore the dragon, to the one flying overhead, making every living thing\ntremble in fear.</p><p>She has gone from Dany to\nDaenerys Targaryen. </p><p>And this isn\u2019t supposed to\nbe a good thing. Like I said, it\u2019s not a coincidence that we\u2019re introduced to \u201c<i>waking\nthe dragon</i>\u201d as something Dany should fear. The imagery of her dreams is very\nclear; Dany is burned away, and in the ashes rises Daenerys Targaryen, Queen\nand Conqueror. </p><p>The most ominous and\nforeboding part of how Daenerys wakes the dragons, is of course the sacrifice\nshe makes to hatch them. It\u2019s pretty clear in the text, but confirmed by GRRM\nin interviews, that Daenerys is able to walk into the fire unscathed and hatch\nher dragons because of blood magic. She has already lost Drogo and Rhaego\npermanently at this point, so I don\u2019t take issue with using their deaths towards\nsaving herself, but the sacrifice of Mirri is entirely different. I want to\nestablish that Daenerys knows what she is doing when she chooses to burn Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI remember what you told\nme. Only death can pay for life.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>I\u2019ve seen many people who\nargue that Daenerys would eventually turn dark use this quote as one of the\nfirst signs:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou will not hear me scream,\u201d\nMirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Dany said</p></blockquote><p>But to me, the end of\nthat sentence is much more frightening:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cbut it is not your\nscreams I want, only your life.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys understands that\nMirri\u2019s death is paying for her dragons, and that\u2019s <i>why</i> she does it. I would\nunderstand, I would be <i>less</i> worried for\nDany, if her killing Mirri was a rash decision made out of grief, exhaustion,\npure rage; but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a cold, rational, <i>calm</i> decision; she thinks about it, understands it, <i>and then</i> burns Mirri alive. </p><p>Remember when I said\nMirri had a valuable lesson to teach Daenerys, and Daenerys learned all the\nwrong things? This is what she learned, that only death can pay for life. Instead\nof hearing Mirri\u2019s critique on what Dany was complicit in, Daenerys takes it to\nheart that death should not be meaningless; not in the way that life is\nprecious and therefore should be preserved, but in the way that she should get\nsomething out of it \u2013 in this case dragons. </p><p>I also want to call\nattention to what Mirri is to Daenerys. A lot of Daenerys\u2019 more adamant\ndefenders will call back to the same argument every time: Daenerys kills\nslavers. Killing bad men, even if in brutal fashion, cannot just suddenly\nchange into killing the innocent and oppressed. But remember, Mirri is where it\nall started; yes Daenerys was in some way involved in the brutality that befell\nthe Lhazareen people, but it is clear she didn\u2019t have a full understanding of\nwhat she was asking when she said she wanted to take the Iron Throne, and turned\nback on her decision to try and help the girls. Burning Mirri Maz Duur is the\nfirst death that is the direct result of Daenerys\u2019 choice (Viserys\u2019 death was\nthe result of <i>his </i>choices). And who\nwas Mirri to Daenerys? </p><p><b><i>Her slave.</i></b></p><p>This decision also\nhighlights a certain capacity for cruelty. I previously mentioned that Daenerys\nslaps Eroeh, the girl she saw gang raped only days prior, and again she shows\nsomething similar with Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI am tired of the maegi\u2019s\nbraying,\u201d Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife\nkept silent.</p></blockquote><p>I understand that Mirri\nhas taken Rhaego from Daenerys, but it shows a certain tunnel vision Daenerys has\nthat she cannot understanding that much more was taken from Mirri before the\nmaegi resorted in blood magic. </p><p>This kind of tunnel\nvision Daenerys is something she has through all the books, Daznak\u2019s Pit being\nthe clearest example, and <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is no different. The simultaneous\nhorror and beauty of Daenerys\u2019 blaze is breathtaking. Something horrific is\ntaking place; the horse murdered for Drogo is burning, Mirri Maz Duur is\nscreaming, Jorah and the Dothraki are shouting and crying. Yet the language is\nbeautiful:</p><blockquote><p>Huge orange gouts of fire\nunfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking,\nglowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn\nfireflies</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames writhed before\nher like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and\nspinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames were so beautiful,\nthe loveliest things she had ever seen, each on a sorcerer robed in yellow and\norange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and\ngreat yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame</p></blockquote><p>You can almost forget the\nhorror of Mirri burning, because the flames are just so beautiful to Daenerys.\nThe flames are described like dancers, floating and swirling and captivating\nher; everything else doesn\u2019t matter anymore, only the flames. Yet GRRM doesn\u2019t\nlet us fully forget:</p><blockquote><p>The pyre roared in the\ndeepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri\nMaz Duur\u2019s screaming</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She heard the screams of\nfrightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and\nterror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. <i>No</i>, she wanted to shout to\nhim, <i>no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys\nStormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don\u2019t you\nsee? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not trying to say\nthat Daenerys is a bad person now. She still has so many redeeming qualities;\nshe still cares deeply for people, fights against slavery, wants to help her\npeople. In lesser fiction, character arcs on a graph are a straight line headed\nup or down, but GRRM is writing a masterpiece. He has no interest in clean arcs\nbecause real people are not one note; if you plotted a real person\u2019s choices\nout on a graph, it would be a series of small ups and downs while still\ntrending one direction, there could even be massive rises or falls because real\npeople slip and regress as they fall into old habits. Daenerys is on a path\nleading to a dark turn, but she still has many highs left to go. The speech she\ngives to the Dothraki before she lights Drogo\u2019s pyre is evidence of this; she\nlooks out and sees her people, those rejected by the <i>khalasar</i> that left her.\nThe old, the children, the women, the sick or crippled; and she embraces them.\nDaenerys is fiercely loyal to this group of people who still stood by her after\neveryone else left her. And she sets them free; Daenerys\u2019 new<i> khalasar</i> will not\nbe built on the backs of slaves.</p><p>But the dragons call to\nher, and she can\u2019t say no to them. <i>She is the blood of the dragon, and the fire\nis in her.</i> Daenerys wants many things, like peace and home and trees, but all of\nthose things fall away when she sees the glory and bane of her house. When she\nstands in the pyre, everything else falls away; the roaring and cracking of the\nfire and her dragons hatching drowns out the screams and shrieks and cries. The\nfire dances in her eyes and pulls her forward. Her dragons are beautiful and\nterrible, awe inspiring and fear inducing. They will always be both, just as Daenerys\nherself has always had both callings inside her, and it is very fitting that\nher <i>A Game of Thrones</i> arc should end here</p><p><i>For the first time in\nhundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.</i></p>",

Like Tyrion, we as a reader don\u2019t quite know how to feel about her,\nbecause she is the antagonist of our heroes, but when you see things from her\nperspective suddenly this black and white war turns into a hundred different\nshades of grey. </p>[[MORE]]<p><b>The House With The Red Door</b></p><p>Moving from what her existence means to the narrative,\nwe begin to understand what Robert\u2019s Rebellion did to her as a person. The\nfirst we see of her, she is feeling a dress so soft it scares her, as her\nbrother Viserys tells her she must look like a princess:</p><blockquote><p><i>A\nPrincess</i>, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like.\nPerhaps she had never really known.</p></blockquote><p>For the first time in her life, she\u2019s starting to get\na real taste of what she lost as a child, and she\u2019s scared. It becomes clear\nthat Viserys is an abuser in her life, and seeing him so fevered is terrifying.\nFor the first time in his life, he\u2019s been given a clear path to reclaim the\nSeven Kingdoms and the Iron Throne that by rights should be his. Viserys was old\nenough to remember Dragonstone and King\u2019s Landing and the throne he lost; these\nare all tangible things that he can remember, that he knows someone stole from\nhim.</p><p>But Daenerys doesn\u2019t have that connection to Westeros.\nShe wasn\u2019t even born when her mother retreated to Dragonstone, and just a baby\nwhen Willem Darry smuggled her and her brother to Essos. Home is a very loose\nconcept that Daenerys can never firmly grasp because she never truly had one.\nShe understands that she was never allowed to just be a child, but she can\u2019t\nplace where it all went wrong. Viserys has this clear line, when he was 8 and a\nPrince and had everything; then suddenly everyone he knew was dead and he had\nnothing. Daenerys doesn\u2019t have that; all she has is this memory of a house with\na red door.</p><p>This house with the red door is so important to her,\nbecause it is the closest she has ever gotten to home; the one place she can\nlook back on and feel like she had what she was supposed to:</p><blockquote><p>She remembered Ser Willem\ndimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders\nfrom his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always\nbeen kind to Dany. He called her \u201cLittle Princess\u201d and sometime \u201cMy Lady,\u201d\u2026\nThat was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany\nhad her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. </p></blockquote><p>Yet, Daenerys knows that wasn\u2019t really her home,\njust the closest she has come. Her character will chase that feeling, of being\nsafe and in control and having things, for the rest of the books. The house\nwith the red door works so well as a writing device from GRRM, because it is this\nvague idea of a thing; from the beginning it is clear that Daenerys herself\ndoesn\u2019t really understand why this house with a red door appeals so much to\nher, so she can never get that feeling back. From the start, Daenerys is\nchasing this thing that we know she can never have. What she does when <i>she</i>\nrealizes that, is a question for later books.</p><p>But what, from a Doylist perspective, is this house\nwith a red door supposed to be? Daenerys thinks it is home, but the symbolism\nof this house is childhood and innocence. The things Daenerys remembers fondly\nabout it are important; Ser Willem calling her \u201cprincess\u201d, the lemon tree,\nhaving her own room. The first is very important, because being a princess is\nwhat Viserys has filled her head with \u2013 it\u2019s the childhood Daenerys knows she\nwas owed by blood. The lemon tree is a bit more complicated; <i>A Dance With\nDragons</i> will really start breaking down Daenerys and trees and all the imagery\nthat goes with her arc, but trees is what Dany <i>wants</i> to want. To watch the lemon tree grow, is to spend years in\nthe same place. And trees also need peace to grow; you have to love and care\nfor a lemon tree. Having her own room also means that Daenerys was well off. Safe, comfortable, and well-off princesses have their own room with a lemon\ntree outside. So while the house with the red door represents childhood and\ninnocence, I also think it\u2019s important to recognize that it also represents\nDany\u2019s longing for her life of royalty. She doesn\u2019t have the same murderous\nvengeance as Viserys, but she has that same passion for what was taken from\nher; a sort of blinding desire that gets in the way of seeing things clearly,\nespecially when it comes to understanding that the Iron Throne wasn\u2019t stolen\nfrom her family \u2013 they murdered it away chasing dragons. </p><p>Speaking of Daenerys\u2019 connection to home, there is some interesting symbolism at play when\nDaenerys visits the markets. Daenerys loves the\nsights and smells of the Eastern market, the excitement of trying and seeing\nnew things, experiencing something foreign. But she turns toward the\nWestern market because it smells of home. When she was younger and went to the\nbazaar with Viserys, they hardly ever had enough money to buy anything but a\ncertain type of sausage that Daenerys remembers fondly. She finds it again with\nher handmaidens and <i>khas</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThey taste different than I remember,\u201d Dany said\nafter her first few bites.</p><p>\u201cIn Pentos, I make them with pork,\u201d the old woman\nsaid, \u201cbut all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea. These are made of horsemeat,\nKhaleesi, but I spice them the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dany felt disappointed</p></blockquote><p>Something is lost on the Dothraki sea, and home will\nnever be the same again.</p><p><b>She Forgot To Be Afraid</b></p><p>The header has a hopeful sound to it, and the tail end\nof Dany\u2019s first chapters do as well, but the first part of her story is\nincredibly bleak. Fear is such a heavy element in Dany\u2019s story, partially\nbecause it really sets up the decisions she\u2019ll make in her final chapters, but\nmostly because it is the reason for her character growth. Once Dany finds her\nplace and begins leading as a Khaleesi, we start to see her true personality\ncome out and she is a person again. But for the first few chapters, Dany has\nalmost none of the character traits that later define her, because fear has\nsuppressed them. Living under Viserys as she grew up, constantly dancing around\nhis \u201cdragon\u201d, she had no space to be the bold, fierce, avenging girl she ends <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i> as. A couple of her traits really shine through in these first\nchapters, like how much more intelligent and perceptive she is compared to\nViserys and some of the adults around her, because her others characteristics\nhave been put on hold; but it\u2019s really just tragic to read about Dany\u2019s life up\nto this point. Viserys has lied to her (unintentionally, since he is\ndelusional, but\u2026) and made her think she\u2019s only been one step ahead of\nassassins her whole life, and then turned around and abused her for things out\nof her control (like her mother Rhaella dying in childbirth, or how he sold\ntheir mother\u2019s crown to feed her):</p><blockquote><p>His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts\nand tightened on a nipple. \u201cYou will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go\nhard for you. You don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d His fingers twisted\nher, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal\nDrogo\u2019s army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for\nthat, you will.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d let his whole <i>khalasar</i> fuck you if need\nbe, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what\nit took to get my army. Be grateful it is only Drogo.</p></blockquote><p>The picture this paints of what Viserys has been like\nto Daenerys for years now is shocking (later books will also elaborate that\nViserys tried to rape her in the days after this, but Ilyrio\u2019s men stopped\nhim). And like I said earlier, the way Dany has to avoid waking his dragon\nconsumes all of her mental energy. Between trying not to anger him, and longing\nfor days before he became so cruel, there simply isn\u2019t anymore left Dany can\ngive.</p><p><b>The Blood of the Dragon</b></p><p>From the very first chapter, Viserys introduces us to\na core concept of GRRM\u2019s world, and for lack of a better name, I\u2019d call it\nTargaryen entitlement. Even after Viserys dies demanding he be crowned in <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i>, we aren\u2019t even close to understanding the full reach of\nTargaryens overstepping in the name of themselves.<i> Fire and Blood Volume I</i>\nshows us that Aegon conquered a whole continent to get his relative a girl,\nwhether she wanted him or no. That\u2019s the kind of history standing behind\nViserys when he threatens Dany with Drogo\u2019s <i>khalasar</i>.</p><p>But for now, Viserys is our look inside what led to\nthe implosion of the Targaryen dynasty, and it\u2019s not pretty:</p><blockquote><p>The dragon does not beg</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You do not command the dragon</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon speaks as he likes</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon is not mocked</p></blockquote><p>And Daenerys\u2019 inner monologue gives some context as to\nwhy \u201cthe dragon\u201d sees himself as so far above the rest:</p><blockquote><p>Dragons did not mate with\nthe beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of\nlesser men.</p></blockquote><p>Later books and the extended canon will elaborate on\nthis concept further, as we learn the Targaryens are quite literally the blood\nof the dragon (which is why their severe inbreeding leads to dragon/human\nhybrid babies); but the important thing here is that Viserys views himself as a\nGod amongst men, a majestic beast unfit to mingle with the sheep. This god\ncomplex gives us an understanding of why the Targaryens act the way they do,\nthough; when you\u2019re so high above everyone else, their lives start to matter\nless and less. </p><p>The idea that Targaryens are inherently better than\neveryone else, drives Viserys as much as his own victimization does:</p><blockquote><p>Ours by blood right\u2026You do not steal from the\ndragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers</p></blockquote><p>Viserys\u2019 language is filled with quotes like this. While\nhe does talk of getting revenge for his brother Rhaegar, or killing the usurper\nwho sits on his father\u2019s throne, an equal amount of his anger is focused on\nbeing a dragon. Not only did the Usurper take what belonged to him, but he\ndared to think himself equal to a dragon. </p><p>And Daenerys does not seem particularly interested in\neither of these things:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cPlease, <i>please</i>,\nViserys, I don\u2019t want to, I want to go home.\u201d\u2026Dany had only meant their\nrooms in Illyrio\u2019s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother\ndid not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house\nwith the red door had not been home for him.</p></blockquote><p>From the beginning, Dany has found strength in being\nDaenerys Targaryen, but not in the way Viserys did. She is empowered by it because\nit gives her a sense of identity; even though she doesn\u2019t have a real home or\nreal friends or anybody, she knows who she is. Daenerys Stormborn of the House\nTargaryen is not meaningless, she is important; and Dany needs that to hold\nonto. Her last name cost her so much, but it\u2019s also what keeps her going.</p><p>Once her relationship with Viserys starts to fall\napart, Daenerys\u2019 relationship to being a Targaryen starts to change. When\nDaenerys embraces the <i>khalasar</i>, she suddenly becomes very powerful; as long as\nKhal Drogo is alive, all the men must follow her commands or risk their Khal\u2019s\nwrath. And being Khaleesi also gives Daenerys a certain sense of place; it\u2019s\nnever going to be home to her, but she belongs there much more than she\u2019s ever\nbelonged anywhere else. She fully begins to embrace their customs by dressing\nas they do, learning to speak Dothraki, and respecting their sacred beliefs. For\nthe first time in many years she feels comfortable, and she can\u2019t understand why\nViserys won\u2019t at least try and join her. The more Dany finds a place for\nherself, the more determined Viserys is to demean and reject the Dothraki.\nWhere Dany is enjoying their travels to Vaes Dothrak and wouldn\u2019t mind staying\nwith the Dothraki for any number of days before sailing to Westeros, Viserys\npushes and pushes to get what he bought with Dany\u2019s marriage. He has no interest\nin living with the Dothraki, much less wearing their clothes and speaking their\nlanguage. This divide between them finally allows Dany to see Viserys for what\nhe truly is:</p><blockquote><p>He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful\nthing. Why had she never seen that before? There was a hollow place inside her\nwhere her fear had been.</p></blockquote><p>And seeing him for the pitiful man he\u2019s always been\nstarts to reshape how Daenerys sees herself. Like almost everyone from\nWesteros, Daenerys believes very strongly in two things: hereditary monarchy and\nthe divine right of the Targaryen dynasty. Yet she sees Viserys, who by both\nthose measures is the rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, and understands he\ndoesn\u2019t deserve it:</p><blockquote><p>Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. \u201cTruth\nnow. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?\u201d</p><p>Dany thought about that. \u201cHe would not be a very good\nking, would he?\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cMy brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d\nDany said. She had known that for a long time, she realized. She had known it\nall her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a whisper,\nbut now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear.</p><p>Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. \u201cYou think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could not lead an army even if my lord husband\ngave him one,\u201d Dany said. \u201cHe has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles\nhim as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. He will never\ntake us home\u201d. </p></blockquote><p>Before I continue, there is one thing I want to emphasize\n\u2013 Daenerys <i>never</i> gives up on her\nbrother. David Benioff and Dan Weiss trying to paint his death as a moral\nturning point for Daenerys is simply not true. She does put him in his place,\nlike when she takes his horse away from him, but those are not bad things; he\nphysically abuses her, and she removes him from her space by having him at the back\nof the <i>khalasar</i>. It was a logical and reasonable punishment for his behavior,\nespecially because as Khaleesi she could have had him killed for it. Up until\nhe tries to cut her child out of her, Dany never considers harming him and\ntries very hard to make him see reason. Even though she feels incredibly close\nto her dragon eggs, she offers them to Viserys as a last chance to make him\nhappy and to save his life.</p><p>While she didn\u2019t give up on him as her brother, she\ndid give up on him as her King:</p><blockquote><p>When her son sat the Iron Throne, she would see that\nhe had bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his\nKingsguard.</p></blockquote><p>I wish GRRM spent more time elaborating on this quote\nof Dany\u2019s, because it\u2019s fairly revolutionary. We know from being in Dany\u2019s head\nthat she has no intention of harming or killing Viserys; and yet, she sees her\nson sitting on the Iron Throne. Does she just assume he will do something\nstupid to get him killed on the way? Or has she removed him from the line of\nsuccession because he\u2019s a vicious idiot? I\u2019d like to know more on what Dany\u2019s\nhead space is at that moment. </p><p>It becomes very clear what her thoughts are once he\ndies, though:</p><blockquote><p><i>He\nwas no dragon</i>, Dany thought, curiously calm. <i>Fire cannot kill a dragon</i></p></blockquote><p>Because Daenerys believes in the monarchy and in the\ndivine right of Targaryens, she has to find a way to square Viserys being the \u201crightful\u201d\nKing and also being a monster she won\u2019t put on the Iron Throne. And the concept\nof being a \u201cdragon\u201d is how she does it. Viserys constantly called himself one,\nand Ser Jorah Mormont said her brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and once\nViserys dies Dany realizes she is the dragon. Of course, everyone else was\nusing \u201cthe dragon\u201d in more metaphorical terms, but it becomes clear a little\nlater in the story that Daenerys is much more literally a dragon. Viserys\u2019\ndeath is the first time we see Daenerys fully commit to who she is, the blood\nof the dragon. She rejects Viserys\u2019 version of her family and starts seeing\nherself and her son as the future of House Targaryen.</p><p>Part of her really starting to embrace herself as\nbeing the blood of the dragon, is because she wants to go home to Westeros:</p><blockquote><p>But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King\u2019s\nLanding and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built. It was\nDragonstone where she had been born. In her mind\u2019s eye, they burned with a\nthousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind\u2019s eye, all the\ndoors were red</p></blockquote><p>Before, when it was Viserys forcing Westeros on her,\nshe never wanted it. But being Khaleesi, Dany realizes that she does want what\nher family lost:</p><blockquote><p><i>If\nI were not the blood of the dragon</i>, she thought wistfully, <i>this could be my home</i>. She was khaleesi,\nshe had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve her, warriors to keep\nher safe, an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old.\n. . and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world. That\nshould be enough for any woman\u2026 but not for the dragon. With Viserys gone,\nDaenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and conquerors,\nand so too the child inside her. She must not forget. </p></blockquote><p>This is where some of Daenerys less charming qualities\nare coming out, as far as why and how she wants to take back the Seven\nKingdoms. Wanting power or having it are not inherently bad things, but the\nproblems start to show in how Daenerys wants to gain it. Her urge to conquer\nWesteros is explicitly tied to being Daenerys Targaryen; she wants to reclaim\nit in the name of \u201ckings and conquerors\u201d. There is no way to remove Daenerys\nfrom the long history of abuses Westeros had to suffer under Kings like Aegon\nthe Conqueror, Maegor the Cruel, Aegon the Unworthy, The Mad King Aerys, etc,\nbecause Daenerys is coming for the Iron Throne in their name. She\u2019s not just\nrelated to them, they are what drive her forward. Later books, and especially <i>A\nDance with Dragons</i>, will dive much more into what Fire &amp; Blood means to\nWesteros and Dany, but even in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> there is attention brought to the\nbloody history of House Targaryen. This passage also starts drawing attention\nto the two different people she is; there is Dany, who is a young girl eager\nfor home and love and happiness and belonging, then there is Daenerys Stormborn\nof the House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the\nCruel and old Valyria before them, the dragon\u2019s daughter. </p><p><b>Daughter of Dragons, Bride of Dragons, Mother\nof Dragons</b></p><p>Beyond Daenerys\u2019 familial connection to her house, there\nis a strong magical link to Daenerys and her dragons. Even though they aren\u2019t\nborn until the final chapter, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> really highlights the\nconnection she has to them. She receives her three eggs as a gift at her\nwedding to Khal Drogo:</p><blockquote><p>Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she\nhad ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors\nthat at first she thought they were crusted with jewels</p></blockquote><p>Right after this, Khal Drogo gifts her Dany\u2019s silver,\nwhich she rides and for the first time isn\u2019t afraid. There is a connection\ndrawn between Dany receiving her dragon eggs, and then receiving a mount she finally\nfeels comfortable on. For now, Dany will have to ride her silver, but soon her\ndragons will be her mount. </p><p>The parallels between Daenerys and her dragons are already\nvery clear as well. When she first gets her eggs, they are beautiful but\nseemingly dead; hard and lifeless stone nobody expects to hatch. Similarly,\nDaenerys is overlooked by those around her in favor of her brother Viserys, and she\u2019s seemingly dormant. She doesn\u2019t have any ambitions to cross the Narrow Sea and\ntake back the Iron Throne, and nobody is investing in her future. But instantly\nDaenerys feels something within the hard stone, and keeps them with her almost\nalways.</p><p>When she\u2019s at her lowest of lows on the Dothraki sea,\nat the height of Drogo\u2019s abuse and her feeling lost and unloved, it\u2019s the\ndragons that bring her back from the edge:</p><blockquote><p>Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon\ndream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There was only her and the\ndragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood,\nDany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth,\nthe flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her. She\nopened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it\ncleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear\nand blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and\nyet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce.</p></blockquote><p>After that dream, her chaffed thighs start to heal and\nshe can ride her silver much better than before. Mentally she also finds a new\nstrength and is able to keep going, which leads to her embracing the Dothraki.\nShe is able to draw actual strength from the eggs, and in return they also find\nstrength in her:</p><blockquote><p>She touched one, the largest of the three, running her\nhand lightly over the shell. <i>Black-and-scarlet</i>,\nshe thought, <i>like the dragon in my dream</i>.\nThe stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers\u2026 or was she still\ndreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously. </p></blockquote><p>As Dany starts to come into her own, her dragon eggs\nbegin heating up. Both her and her dragons are starting to wake up. And as the\nbook continues, Dany begins associating herself with dragons and as a dragon\nmore and more; first when Viserys dies, then when Robert sends assassins after\nher, and again when she is claiming the Lhazareen women as her slaves:</p><blockquote><p><i>The\nUsurper has woken the dragon now</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As she grows more comfortable being the dragon, her\neggs slowly get closer and closer to coming alive and Daenerys feels called to\nthem:</p><blockquote><p>Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to\nthe fire and pushed it down amongst the burning coals. The black scales seemed\nto glow as they drank the heat. Flames licked against the stone with small red\ntongues. Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire. As\nshe stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled in her throat.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys also has dreams of literally becoming a\ndragon:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she\nfelt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the\nshadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The door loomed before her, the\nred door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding\nbehind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high\nand higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in\nterror from the shadow of her wings</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys being pregnant with her son also offers a lot\nof insight into what her future is as the last dragon. All of the prophecies\nand foreshadowing surrounding Rhaego are actually about Daenerys, and it\u2019s the\nstart of her destiny being intertwined with the beautiful horror of dragons:</p><blockquote><p>She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt\nthe child move within her \u2026 as if he were reaching out, brother to brother,\nblood to blood. \u201cYou are the dragon,\u201d Dany whispered to him,\n\u201cthe true dragon. I know it. I know it.\u201d And she smiled, and went to\nsleep dreaming of home.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cAs swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his\n<i>khalasar</i> covers the earth, men without number, with <i>arakhs</i> shining in their\nhands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies\nwill tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend\ntheir flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk\nmen in the stone tents will fear his name.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The first quote really affirms Daenerys\u2019 role in the story\nas the true dragon, the last dragon. In <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, as well as in <i>A\nStorm of Swords</i> and <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>, Daenerys has dreams of turning into\nRhaegar; while fandom argues what this means and there is plenty of different\nmeanings it could have, I personally believe the foreshadowing is that Daenerys\nis the last dragon. Many times in the story that role is given to Rhaegar, but\nwe see with Daenerys that she is more a dragon than he ever was.</p><p>The second quote is the prophecy given to Daenerys by\nthe <i>Dosh Khaleen</i> in Vaes Dothrak, where they name her son <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>. This prophecy is obviously about\nDaenerys; the Dosh Khaleen assumed the future they were seeing belonged to her\nson, but they were actually seeing Daenerys\u2019 own future. Rhaego dying makes it\nquite clear, but the prophecy referring to the Stallion Who Mounts the World as\n\u201c<i>fierce as a storm</i>\u201d really seals the deal; after all she is Daenerys <b>Stormborn</b>,\nnamed after the storm that destroyed her family\u2019s fleet. This prophecy is extremely\nominous, with lines like \u201c<i>His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will\nweep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief</i>\u201d and \u201c<i>milk men in the stone\ntents will fear his name</i>\u201d; this does not sound like Daenerys is going to be\nliberating Westeros (the \u201cstone tents\u201d is a reference to castles). The name this\n\u201cprince\u201d is given, <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>, is also very similar to\nanother prophecy of Martin\u2019s \u2013 the rape of Westeros Daenerys sees in the House\nof the Undying. The language used to describe how the Stallion comes to mount\nthe world is bloody and violent; wives crying for their husbands, men living in\nfear, etc. It\u2019s a very concerning look into the future.</p><p><b>If I Look Back I Am Lost</b></p><p>A lot of people had problems with <i>Game of Thrones\u2019</i>\ndepiction of Daenerys in s8, based on the idea that her dark turn came out of\nnowhere. And in no way am I defending the show\u2019s characterization of her, or\nthe portrayal of her dark turn, but a lot of that criticism has gotten carried\nover to Daenerys as she stands in GRRM\u2019s books, which is simply not true.\nDaenerys has struggled with darkness her entire arc, and it really comes to the\nforefront in her last several <i>A Game of Thrones</i> chapters.</p><p>The Dothraki raid of the Lhazareen village is a huge\nturning point for Daenerys. Once Robert attempts to have her assassinated, Dany\nis finally able to convince Khal Drogo to sail across the Narrow Sea and take\nthe Iron Throne for her and her son. To do this, the Khalasar attack a peaceful\nvillage and a rival <i>khalasar</i>, and it\u2019s Dany\u2019s first real look at what her war\nfor the Iron Throne will be like:</p><blockquote><p>Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the\nrye and lentils into the ground, while <i>arakhs</i> and arrows had sown a terrible\nnew crop and watered it with blood.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys see\u2019s Khal Drogo\u2019s men herding a young boy,\nteasing him until they get bored of the game and cut his head off. The men are\nalso raping women atop piles of their dead people, and it\u2019s sickening to her:</p><blockquote><p>It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them;\nshe remembered what terror felt like.</p></blockquote><p>As she continues to walk through the Dothraki\u2019s\ndestruction, she tries to steel herself to the horrors around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>I\nam the blood of the dragon</i>, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself\nas she turned her face away. She pressed her lips together and hardened her\nheart and rode on toward the gate.</p></blockquote><p>But as she realizes their captives will be sold into\nslavery, she breaks:</p><blockquote><p><i>Slaves</i>,\nDany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver\u2019s\nBay. She wanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. <i>This is war, this is what it looks like,\nthis is the price of the Iron Throne</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Notice what GRRM calls her here; in the first quote\nwhen she is able to harden her heart and ride forward she is \u201cDaenerys\nTargaryen\u201d, but in the second when she almost begins to cry GRRM softens and\ncalls her \u201cDany\u201d. I\u2019ll get into it more below, but Daenerys is constantly at\nodds with herself and those are the two versions of her. Remember when I said\nthe lemon tree is what Dany wants to want? There is a part of her that craves\nthat simplicity, but life keeps pushing and pulling her towards that other part\nof her, the blood of the dragon, the seed of kings and conquerors, the part of\nher that is Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.</p><p>But in this moment, Daenerys Targaryen loses. Dany,\nthe part of her that remembers what it\u2019s like to be terrified, to be a slave,\ndecides to turn back:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending\nsound, a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on. Dany\u2019s hand clenched\nhard around the reins, and she turned the silver\u2019s head. \u201cMake them stop,\u201d she commanded\nSer Jorah.</p></blockquote><p>Notice how this passage starts: <i>Behind them</i>. Daenerys has to <i>look\nback</i> to save Eroeh. By the end of this book, Daenerys has made \u201c<i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>\u201d into her life philosophy, and it\u2019s heartbreaking. Her last\ncouple of chapters tell the story of a good-hearted person trying to help\npeople and fix the mistake she\u2019s made, yet when it all goes south she learns\nall the wrong lessons. </p><p>When Daenerys tries to claim these women to save them,\nshe does it with all the naivety of a 14yo girl. We shouldn\u2019t expect her to\nknow what to do in these situations; she\u2019s a young girl and she has a very\nsimple understanding of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and more importantly she\nhas a very simple understanding of what is and isn\u2019t a slave. </p><p>One of the women she saves in this town is Mirri Maz\nDuur:</p><blockquote><p>They passed other women being raped. Each time Dany\nreined up, sent her <i>khas</i> to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave.\nOne of them, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany\nhaltingly in the Common Tongue. </p></blockquote><p>Mirri is the only woman who says thank you to Dany,\nwhereas the others are terrified that Dany has spared them for something worse.\nSo, when Mirri speaks up that she can help Khal Drogo, Dany stands up for her\nagainst the Dothraki and allows her to help him. The mental processes of Mirri\nMaz Duur are still actually very unclear, and I know a lot of people argue over\nwhen she decided what she was going to do and even what she actually did. But\nto me, it seems heavily implied that Mirri\u2019s original efforts were made in good\nfaith. Khal Drogo falls ill because he disregards every single one of Mirri\u2019s\ninstructions by ripping her poultice off, smearing his wound in mud, and\ndrinking wine and milk of the poppy heavily. When Dany calls Mirri to look at\nhim again, she instantly knows Drogo has ignored her:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dany admitted.</p><p>\u201cI made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and\nbound it in a lambskin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned, he said. He tore it off. The herbwomen\nmade him a new one, wet and soothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned, yes. There is great healing magic in fire,\neven your hairless men know that.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Mirri seems very genuine here, and lays out that Drogo\nignored everything she told him. It doesn\u2019t make logical sense that she could have\ndone this to him, considering he ripped her poultice off almost immediately and\npreceded to do all the things she told him not to. I think Mirri made a genuine\nattempt to help Drogo, either altruistically or as an attempt to gain favor\nwith her new master (Dany), and then is completely ignored, which seems to\nupset her. What also upsets her, is that Dany owns her:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou do not ask a slave,\u201d Mirri replied sharply, \u201cyou\ntell her.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As we progress further, I really want to encourage\nreaders to remember Mirri\u2019s perspective in this story. I won\u2019t dive too deep\ninto her motivations, because this is about Dany and Mirri really deserves a\nmeta of her own, but understanding her is key to understanding what GRRM is\ntrying to say at the climax of Dany\u2019s arc. Remember that Dany threw the first\npunch between them, and while Dany did try to help Mirri, Mirri tried equally\nto help Dany and Drogo and had her efforts thrown back in her face. </p><p>And while Mirri Maz Duur is entirely misleading at\npoints, she never lies to Dany and she tries to talk Dany out of it:</p><blockquote><p>Mirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied\nDaenerys through eyes as black as night. \u201cThere is a spell.\u201d Her voice was\nquiet, scarcely more than a whisper. \u201cBut it is hard, lady, and dark. Some\nwould say that death is cleaner. I learned the way in Asshai, and paid dear for\nthe lesson. My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The first time Dany thinks to herself \u201c<i>If I look back\nI am lost</i>\u201d, is when Mirri tells her she knew that the price to pay was Rhaego\nand did it anyway. I\u2019ve seen it argued that this is unclear or false, but I\ncompletely disagree. This quote here is evidence enough:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cDeath?\u201d Dany wrapped her arms around herself\nprotectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. \u201cMy death?\u201d She told herself\nshe would die for him, if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would\nnot be afraid. </p></blockquote><p>Dany dying for Drogo would certainly lead to Rhaego\u2019s\ndeath as well, since the sacrifice needs to happen before the night is done and\nDany has no thoughts of going into labor. This quote makes it even clearer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mirri Maz Duur promised. \u201cNot your death, Khaleesi.\u201d\n</p><p>Dany trembled with relief. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>She agrees before Mirri tells her what the sacrifice\nis. Dany would have given up anything in that moment to save Khal Drogo. </p><p>Like I said earlier, she\nis still a very young girl here and doesn\u2019t have any reason to be able to\nhandle the weight that\u2019s been placed on her. But she gets incredibly focused on\nDrogo once he falls sick, and her care and compassion for anyone else seems to\ndisappear:</p><blockquote><p>Eroeh stared fearfully at\nDrogo where he lay. \u201cHe dies,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Dany slapped her.</p></blockquote><p>Eroeh is the girl\nDaenerys saw gang raped atop a pile of corpses, the girl who\u2019s wails turned Dany\naround. </p><p>After everything goes so\nhorribly wrong, when Drogo\u2019s men turn against her and Jorah brings her into the\ntent with Mirri and she loses Rhaego and Drogo and wakes up with nothing, Mirri\ntells her this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI spoke for you,\u201d she\nsaid, anguished. \u201cI saved you.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Saved</i> me?\u201d The Lhazareen woman spat. \u201cThree riders had taken me,\nnot as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth\nwas in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god\u2019s house\nburn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well,\nand in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my\nbread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons\npast. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips.\nTell me again what you saved.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour life.\u201d </p><p>Mirri Maz Duur laughed\ncruelly. \u201cLook to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is\ngone.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Mirri obviously makes\nsome morally dubious decisions, but there is a lot of truth in what she tells\nDaenerys. What Dany viewed as saving, Mirri sees as a pitiful gesture; the damage\nwas already done before Dany changed her mind, and she didn\u2019t see or understand\nthat. If Daenerys was in a more understanding mindset, Mirri has a great lesson\nto teach her about how you treat people, especially your slaves (because yes,\nMirri is Dany\u2019s slave). </p><p>That\u2019s not the lesson\nDany learns though, she learns <i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>; which is a callback to a passage from her earlier chapters:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them the great\nhorde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking\ndust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant</p></blockquote><p>Deciding not to look back\nis a decision Dany makes so she doesn\u2019t have to face the reality of her choices\nand mistakes. Everything is okay if she doesn\u2019t turn back, if she doesn\u2019t see\nthe way her actions sow a crop of blood in the soil. But like I said, Dany\u2019s\nbest moments come when she looks behind her. If she didn\u2019t look back for Eroeh,\nshe would have left women to be raped and sold into slavery. Especially when we\nget to <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and<i> A Dance with Dragons</i>, it\u2019s just so clear that\nlooking back is essential to Dany\u2019s morality. She tries not to through those\nbooks, but she can\u2019t stop herself. Yet every time she does, she hates it. She\nhates that she saved Mirri Maz Duur and cost herself so much in the process. That\u2019s\nwhy she tells herself <i>If I look back I am\nlost</i>, to remember to never look back again. </p><p><b>Waking the Dragon</b></p><p>This is the climax of\nDany\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>; everything in her chapters is leading her to\nthe moment she steps into Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre. From her first chapter, she\ndreams of her dragons:</p><blockquote><p><i>There\nare no more dragons</i>, Dany thought, staring at her brother,\nthough she did not dare say it aloud.</p><p>Yet that night she dreamt\nof one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear.\nShe ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again.\nShe stumbled and fell. \u201cYou woke the dragon,\u201d he screamed as he kicked her. \u201cYou\nwoke the dragon, you woke the dragon.\u201d Her thighs were slick with blood. She\nclosed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping\nsound and the <i>crackling</i> of some great\nfire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all\naround, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head\nslowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a\nfine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid\u2026</p></blockquote><p>Her next dream has a much\nmore positive feel, but carries the same language:</p><blockquote><p>She opened her arms to\nthe fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper\nher and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough\naway, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam</p></blockquote><p>This dream really reminds\nme of GRRM\u2019s inspiration for his title, <i>Fire and Ice</i> by Robert Frost:</p><blockquote><p>Some say the world will\nend in fire/Some say in ice/From what I\u2019ve tasted of desire/I hold with those\nwho favor fire</p></blockquote><p>When Dany is in Mirri\u2019s\ntent, her dreams start to take on a very ominous tone:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain\nripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of\nburning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The\ndoor loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur\naround her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew\nacross the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all\nthat lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings</p><p>\u2026</p><p>She woke to the taste of\nashes.</p></blockquote><p>The progression of her\ndreams tell an interesting story. At first, when Daenerys wants no part of\nViserys\u2019 dreams or the Seven Kingdoms, the dragon in her dream terrifies her\nand she wakes more scared than she\u2019s ever been. But when the dream comes to her\non the Dothraki sea, after she\u2019s received her eggs as a wedding gift, she\nembraces the dragon in her dream; lets the fire mold and shape her, burn away\nher fear and hurt. And when she\u2019s fever dreaming in Mirri\u2019s tent, she takes the\nnext step and becomes the dragon; flying over Westeros, chasing the red door. As\nDany progresses through <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, she slowly embraces the dragon until\nshe is ready to hatch them in her final chapter.</p><p>What\u2019s most interesting\nis the framing of what that means. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that we are\nintroduced to the concept of \u201c<i>waking the dragon</i>\u201d through Viserys\u2019 threats to\nDaenerys. From the first chapter, we\u2019re meant to understand that waking the\ndragon is really bad for Daenerys. She tries her hardest <i>not</i> to wake the dragon, because something very bad will happen to\nher if she does. And her first dream of the dragon from her second chapter\nfeeds into this narrative; the dragon seeks to burn her.</p><p>In her second dream, she\nis much more comfortable standing before the dragon; but it\u2019s important to realize\nthat nothing has changed in the structure of the dream. Her dragon still wants\nto burn her, but now she finds strength in that; let this dragon burn away her\nweakness and temper her strength. She\u2019s starting to grow closer to her eggs,\nand also more comfortable with her heritage. Being with the Dothraki stripped her\nof everything except herself, and she\u2019s starting to fall back on that for strength.</p><p>A lot of time passes before\nshe has her last and final dream before hatching her dragons, and the tone has\nnow changed. She isn\u2019t standing before the dragon; she is the dragon. In her\ndream, she hears Viserys saying \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d\nand as she dreams it slowly falls away until all she hears is \u201cwake the dragon\u201d.\nThrough her travels on the Dothraki Sea, she\u2019s gone from a scared girl cowering\nbefore the dragon, to the one flying overhead, making every living thing\ntremble in fear.</p><p>She has gone from Dany to\nDaenerys Targaryen. </p><p>And this isn\u2019t supposed to\nbe a good thing. Like I said, it\u2019s not a coincidence that we\u2019re introduced to \u201c<i>waking\nthe dragon</i>\u201d as something Dany should fear. The imagery of her dreams is very\nclear; Dany is burned away, and in the ashes rises Daenerys Targaryen, Queen\nand Conqueror. </p><p>The most ominous and\nforeboding part of how Daenerys wakes the dragons, is of course the sacrifice\nshe makes to hatch them. It\u2019s pretty clear in the text, but confirmed by GRRM\nin interviews, that Daenerys is able to walk into the fire unscathed and hatch\nher dragons because of blood magic. She has already lost Drogo and Rhaego\npermanently at this point, so I don\u2019t take issue with using their deaths towards\nsaving herself, but the sacrifice of Mirri is entirely different. I want to\nestablish that Daenerys knows what she is doing when she chooses to burn Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI remember what you told\nme. Only death can pay for life.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>I\u2019ve seen many people who\nargue that Daenerys would eventually turn dark use this quote as one of the\nfirst signs:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou will not hear me scream,\u201d\nMirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Dany said</p></blockquote><p>But to me, the end of\nthat sentence is much more frightening:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cbut it is not your\nscreams I want, only your life.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys understands that\nMirri\u2019s death is paying for her dragons, and that\u2019s <i>why</i> she does it. I would\nunderstand, I would be <i>less</i> worried for\nDany, if her killing Mirri was a rash decision made out of grief, exhaustion,\npure rage; but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a cold, rational, <i>calm</i> decision; she thinks about it, understands it, <i>and then</i> burns Mirri alive. </p><p>Remember when I said\nMirri had a valuable lesson to teach Daenerys, and Daenerys learned all the\nwrong things? This is what she learned, that only death can pay for life. Instead\nof hearing Mirri\u2019s critique on what Dany was complicit in, Daenerys takes it to\nheart that death should not be meaningless; not in the way that life is\nprecious and therefore should be preserved, but in the way that she should get\nsomething out of it \u2013 in this case dragons. </p><p>I also want to call\nattention to what Mirri is to Daenerys. A lot of Daenerys\u2019 more adamant\ndefenders will call back to the same argument every time: Daenerys kills\nslavers. Killing bad men, even if in brutal fashion, cannot just suddenly\nchange into killing the innocent and oppressed. But remember, Mirri is where it\nall started; yes Daenerys was in some way involved in the brutality that befell\nthe Lhazareen people, but it is clear she didn\u2019t have a full understanding of\nwhat she was asking when she said she wanted to take the Iron Throne, and turned\nback on her decision to try and help the girls. Burning Mirri Maz Duur is the\nfirst death that is the direct result of Daenerys\u2019 choice (Viserys\u2019 death was\nthe result of <i>his </i>choices). And who\nwas Mirri to Daenerys? </p><p><b><i>Her slave.</i></b></p><p>This decision also\nhighlights a certain capacity for cruelty. I previously mentioned that Daenerys\nslaps Eroeh, the girl she saw gang raped only days prior, and again she shows\nsomething similar with Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI am tired of the maegi\u2019s\nbraying,\u201d Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife\nkept silent.</p></blockquote><p>I understand that Mirri\nhas taken Rhaego from Daenerys, but it shows a certain tunnel vision Daenerys has\nthat she cannot understanding that much more was taken from Mirri before the\nmaegi resorted in blood magic. </p><p>This kind of tunnel\nvision Daenerys is something she has through all the books, Daznak\u2019s Pit being\nthe clearest example, and <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is no different. The simultaneous\nhorror and beauty of Daenerys\u2019 blaze is breathtaking. Something horrific is\ntaking place; the horse murdered for Drogo is burning, Mirri Maz Duur is\nscreaming, Jorah and the Dothraki are shouting and crying. Yet the language is\nbeautiful:</p><blockquote><p>Huge orange gouts of fire\nunfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking,\nglowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn\nfireflies</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames writhed before\nher like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and\nspinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames were so beautiful,\nthe loveliest things she had ever seen, each on a sorcerer robed in yellow and\norange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and\ngreat yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame</p></blockquote><p>You can almost forget the\nhorror of Mirri burning, because the flames are just so beautiful to Daenerys.\nThe flames are described like dancers, floating and swirling and captivating\nher; everything else doesn\u2019t matter anymore, only the flames. Yet GRRM doesn\u2019t\nlet us fully forget:</p><blockquote><p>The pyre roared in the\ndeepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri\nMaz Duur\u2019s screaming</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She heard the screams of\nfrightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and\nterror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. <i>No</i>, she wanted to shout to\nhim, <i>no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys\nStormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don\u2019t you\nsee? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not trying to say\nthat Daenerys is a bad person now. She still has so many redeeming qualities;\nshe still cares deeply for people, fights against slavery, wants to help her\npeople. In lesser fiction, character arcs on a graph are a straight line headed\nup or down, but GRRM is writing a masterpiece. He has no interest in clean arcs\nbecause real people are not one note; if you plotted a real person\u2019s choices\nout on a graph, it would be a series of small ups and downs while still\ntrending one direction, there could even be massive rises or falls because real\npeople slip and regress as they fall into old habits. Daenerys is on a path\nleading to a dark turn, but she still has many highs left to go. The speech she\ngives to the Dothraki before she lights Drogo\u2019s pyre is evidence of this; she\nlooks out and sees her people, those rejected by the <i>khalasar</i> that left her.\nThe old, the children, the women, the sick or crippled; and she embraces them.\nDaenerys is fiercely loyal to this group of people who still stood by her after\neveryone else left her. And she sets them free; Daenerys\u2019 new<i> khalasar</i> will not\nbe built on the backs of slaves.</p><p>But the dragons call to\nher, and she can\u2019t say no to them. <i>She is the blood of the dragon, and the fire\nis in her.</i> Daenerys wants many things, like peace and home and trees, but all of\nthose things fall away when she sees the glory and bane of her house. When she\nstands in the pyre, everything else falls away; the roaring and cracking of the\nfire and her dragons hatching drowns out the screams and shrieks and cries. The\nfire dances in her eyes and pulls her forward. Her dragons are beautiful and\nterrible, awe inspiring and fear inducing. They will always be both, just as Daenerys\nherself has always had both callings inside her, and it is very fitting that\nher <i>A Game of Thrones</i> arc should end here</p><p><i>For the first time in\nhundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.</i></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Due to\u2026recent events\u2026I think it\u2019s important to\ngo back through George RR Martin\u2019s books and really understand what he was trying\nto say with Daenerys Targaryen. She occupies the same space in the narrative\nthat Jon Snow does, where she\u2019s just stereotypical enough, just fantasy trope\nenough, that people take for granted who her character is and what she\nrepresents. But, like Jon, if you read her chapters with an open mind, you\u2019ll\nnotice all of these great subversions and character traits that you miss the\nfirst time.</p><p>Breaking down the journey she takes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, GRRM lays a lot of\ntracks for where the story will take her\u2026 </p><p><b>The Outsider</b></p><p>The first thing about Daenerys is that she is\ninstantly an outsider. GRRM loves writing outsiders, and a huge amount of the\nPOV\u2019s in book one are introduced as an outsider in some way; Jon being a\nbastard in a society driven by status, Arya as a tomboy in a patriarchal\nsociety, Sansa as someone who doesn\u2019t fit with her family, Tyrion as a dwarf in\nan ableist society, and so on. Daenerys takes this concept to its extreme; not\nonly is she an outsider within her own world, she is an outsider within the\nnarrative. All the POVs we\u2019ll have in this book were the victors of Robert\u2019s\nRebellion. They may have lost things (like Ned losing Lyanna) but Robert\u2019s\nRebellion worked for them in a way that they either ended up better off than\nbefore, or received some form of justice for the wrongs they\u2019d suffered.\u00a0</p><p>But\nDaenerys <i>lost</i>. She was supposed to be\na Princess, to grow up in the Red Keep with an entire kingdom at her feet. Instead, we are introduced to a young girl who hasn\u2019t truly known a home her\nwhole life, a girl who thinks she was chased around a continent by assassins\nout to take her life. We know, because we\u2019ve lived inside Eddard Stark\u2019s head,\nthat Daenerys\u2019 family was unequivocally on the wrong side of Robert\u2019s\nRebellion, but suddenly we understand that even in a just war, innocent people\nwill get ruined.</p><p>So, with Daenerys being the lone Targaryen POV we\nhave, it creates a sort of dissonance where she is portrayed as sympathetic,\nyet is the natural enemy to the Starks who are our heroes. When her brother\nViserys tells her these awful stories of \u201c<i>the Usurper and his dogs</i>\u201d, we know\nshe\u2019s being lied to because we know Eddard Stark, but yet we have to sympathize\nwith this child who was supposed to have everything and, instead, was left with\nnothing. Like Tyrion, we as a reader don\u2019t quite know how to feel about her,\nbecause she is the antagonist of our heroes, but when you see things from her\nperspective suddenly this black and white war turns into a hundred different\nshades of grey. </p>[[MORE]]<p><b>The House With The Red Door</b></p><p>Moving from what her existence means to the narrative,\nwe begin to understand what Robert\u2019s Rebellion did to her as a person. The\nfirst we see of her, she is feeling a dress so soft it scares her, as her\nbrother Viserys tells her she must look like a princess:</p><blockquote><p><i>A\nPrincess</i>, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like.\nPerhaps she had never really known.</p></blockquote><p>For the first time in her life, she\u2019s starting to get\na real taste of what she lost as a child, and she\u2019s scared. It becomes clear\nthat Viserys is an abuser in her life, and seeing him so fevered is terrifying.\nFor the first time in his life, he\u2019s been given a clear path to reclaim the\nSeven Kingdoms and the Iron Throne that by rights should be his. Viserys was old\nenough to remember Dragonstone and King\u2019s Landing and the throne he lost; these\nare all tangible things that he can remember, that he knows someone stole from\nhim.</p><p>But Daenerys doesn\u2019t have that connection to Westeros.\nShe wasn\u2019t even born when her mother retreated to Dragonstone, and just a baby\nwhen Willem Darry smuggled her and her brother to Essos. Home is a very loose\nconcept that Daenerys can never firmly grasp because she never truly had one.\nShe understands that she was never allowed to just be a child, but she can\u2019t\nplace where it all went wrong. Viserys has this clear line, when he was 8 and a\nPrince and had everything; then suddenly everyone he knew was dead and he had\nnothing. Daenerys doesn\u2019t have that; all she has is this memory of a house with\na red door.</p><p>This house with the red door is so important to her,\nbecause it is the closest she has ever gotten to home; the one place she can\nlook back on and feel like she had what she was supposed to:</p><blockquote><p>She remembered Ser Willem\ndimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders\nfrom his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always\nbeen kind to Dany. He called her \u201cLittle Princess\u201d and sometime \u201cMy Lady,\u201d\u2026\nThat was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany\nhad her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. </p></blockquote><p>Yet, Daenerys knows that wasn\u2019t really her home,\njust the closest she has come. Her character will chase that feeling, of being\nsafe and in control and having things, for the rest of the books. The house\nwith the red door works so well as a writing device from GRRM, because it is this\nvague idea of a thing; from the beginning it is clear that Daenerys herself\ndoesn\u2019t really understand why this house with a red door appeals so much to\nher, so she can never get that feeling back. From the start, Daenerys is\nchasing this thing that we know she can never have. What she does when <i>she</i>\nrealizes that, is a question for later books.</p><p>But what, from a Doylist perspective, is this house\nwith a red door supposed to be? Daenerys thinks it is home, but the symbolism\nof this house is childhood and innocence. The things Daenerys remembers fondly\nabout it are important; Ser Willem calling her \u201cprincess\u201d, the lemon tree,\nhaving her own room. The first is very important, because being a princess is\nwhat Viserys has filled her head with \u2013 it\u2019s the childhood Daenerys knows she\nwas owed by blood. The lemon tree is a bit more complicated; <i>A Dance With\nDragons</i> will really start breaking down Daenerys and trees and all the imagery\nthat goes with her arc, but trees is what Dany <i>wants</i> to want. To watch the lemon tree grow, is to spend years in\nthe same place. And trees also need peace to grow; you have to love and care\nfor a lemon tree. Having her own room also means that Daenerys was well off. Safe, comfortable, and well-off princesses have their own room with a lemon\ntree outside. So while the house with the red door represents childhood and\ninnocence, I also think it\u2019s important to recognize that it also represents\nDany\u2019s longing for her life of royalty. She doesn\u2019t have the same murderous\nvengeance as Viserys, but she has that same passion for what was taken from\nher; a sort of blinding desire that gets in the way of seeing things clearly,\nespecially when it comes to understanding that the Iron Throne wasn\u2019t stolen\nfrom her family \u2013 they murdered it away chasing dragons. </p><p>Speaking of Daenerys\u2019 connection to home, there is some interesting symbolism at play when\nDaenerys visits the markets. Daenerys loves the\nsights and smells of the Eastern market, the excitement of trying and seeing\nnew things, experiencing something foreign. But she turns toward the\nWestern market because it smells of home. When she was younger and went to the\nbazaar with Viserys, they hardly ever had enough money to buy anything but a\ncertain type of sausage that Daenerys remembers fondly. She finds it again with\nher handmaidens and <i>khas</i>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThey taste different than I remember,\u201d Dany said\nafter her first few bites.</p><p>\u201cIn Pentos, I make them with pork,\u201d the old woman\nsaid, \u201cbut all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea. These are made of horsemeat,\nKhaleesi, but I spice them the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dany felt disappointed</p></blockquote><p>Something is lost on the Dothraki sea, and home will\nnever be the same again.</p><p><b>She Forgot To Be Afraid</b></p><p>The header has a hopeful sound to it, and the tail end\nof Dany\u2019s first chapters do as well, but the first part of her story is\nincredibly bleak. Fear is such a heavy element in Dany\u2019s story, partially\nbecause it really sets up the decisions she\u2019ll make in her final chapters, but\nmostly because it is the reason for her character growth. Once Dany finds her\nplace and begins leading as a Khaleesi, we start to see her true personality\ncome out and she is a person again. But for the first few chapters, Dany has\nalmost none of the character traits that later define her, because fear has\nsuppressed them. Living under Viserys as she grew up, constantly dancing around\nhis \u201cdragon\u201d, she had no space to be the bold, fierce, avenging girl she ends <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i> as. A couple of her traits really shine through in these first\nchapters, like how much more intelligent and perceptive she is compared to\nViserys and some of the adults around her, because her others characteristics\nhave been put on hold; but it\u2019s really just tragic to read about Dany\u2019s life up\nto this point. Viserys has lied to her (unintentionally, since he is\ndelusional, but\u2026) and made her think she\u2019s only been one step ahead of\nassassins her whole life, and then turned around and abused her for things out\nof her control (like her mother Rhaella dying in childbirth, or how he sold\ntheir mother\u2019s crown to feed her):</p><blockquote><p>His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts\nand tightened on a nipple. \u201cYou will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go\nhard for you. You don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d His fingers twisted\nher, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal\nDrogo\u2019s army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for\nthat, you will.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d let his whole <i>khalasar</i> fuck you if need\nbe, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what\nit took to get my army. Be grateful it is only Drogo.</p></blockquote><p>The picture this paints of what Viserys has been like\nto Daenerys for years now is shocking (later books will also elaborate that\nViserys tried to rape her in the days after this, but Ilyrio\u2019s men stopped\nhim). And like I said earlier, the way Dany has to avoid waking his dragon\nconsumes all of her mental energy. Between trying not to anger him, and longing\nfor days before he became so cruel, there simply isn\u2019t anymore left Dany can\ngive.</p><p><b>The Blood of the Dragon</b></p><p>From the very first chapter, Viserys introduces us to\na core concept of GRRM\u2019s world, and for lack of a better name, I\u2019d call it\nTargaryen entitlement. Even after Viserys dies demanding he be crowned in <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i>, we aren\u2019t even close to understanding the full reach of\nTargaryens overstepping in the name of themselves.<i> Fire and Blood Volume I</i>\nshows us that Aegon conquered a whole continent to get his relative a girl,\nwhether she wanted him or no. That\u2019s the kind of history standing behind\nViserys when he threatens Dany with Drogo\u2019s <i>khalasar</i>.</p><p>But for now, Viserys is our look inside what led to\nthe implosion of the Targaryen dynasty, and it\u2019s not pretty:</p><blockquote><p>The dragon does not beg</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You do not command the dragon</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon speaks as he likes</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon is not mocked</p></blockquote><p>And Daenerys\u2019 inner monologue gives some context as to\nwhy \u201cthe dragon\u201d sees himself as so far above the rest:</p><blockquote><p>Dragons did not mate with\nthe beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of\nlesser men.</p></blockquote><p>Later books and the extended canon will elaborate on\nthis concept further, as we learn the Targaryens are quite literally the blood\nof the dragon (which is why their severe inbreeding leads to dragon/human\nhybrid babies); but the important thing here is that Viserys views himself as a\nGod amongst men, a majestic beast unfit to mingle with the sheep. This god\ncomplex gives us an understanding of why the Targaryens act the way they do,\nthough; when you\u2019re so high above everyone else, their lives start to matter\nless and less. </p><p>The idea that Targaryens are inherently better than\neveryone else, drives Viserys as much as his own victimization does:</p><blockquote><p>Ours by blood right\u2026You do not steal from the\ndragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers</p></blockquote><p>Viserys\u2019 language is filled with quotes like this. While\nhe does talk of getting revenge for his brother Rhaegar, or killing the usurper\nwho sits on his father\u2019s throne, an equal amount of his anger is focused on\nbeing a dragon. Not only did the Usurper take what belonged to him, but he\ndared to think himself equal to a dragon. </p><p>And Daenerys does not seem particularly interested in\neither of these things:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cPlease, <i>please</i>,\nViserys, I don\u2019t want to, I want to go home.\u201d\u2026Dany had only meant their\nrooms in Illyrio\u2019s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother\ndid not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house\nwith the red door had not been home for him.</p></blockquote><p>From the beginning, Dany has found strength in being\nDaenerys Targaryen, but not in the way Viserys did. She is empowered by it because\nit gives her a sense of identity; even though she doesn\u2019t have a real home or\nreal friends or anybody, she knows who she is. Daenerys Stormborn of the House\nTargaryen is not meaningless, she is important; and Dany needs that to hold\nonto. Her last name cost her so much, but it\u2019s also what keeps her going.</p><p>Once her relationship with Viserys starts to fall\napart, Daenerys\u2019 relationship to being a Targaryen starts to change. When\nDaenerys embraces the <i>khalasar</i>, she suddenly becomes very powerful; as long as\nKhal Drogo is alive, all the men must follow her commands or risk their Khal\u2019s\nwrath. And being Khaleesi also gives Daenerys a certain sense of place; it\u2019s\nnever going to be home to her, but she belongs there much more than she\u2019s ever\nbelonged anywhere else. She fully begins to embrace their customs by dressing\nas they do, learning to speak Dothraki, and respecting their sacred beliefs. For\nthe first time in many years she feels comfortable, and she can\u2019t understand why\nViserys won\u2019t at least try and join her. The more Dany finds a place for\nherself, the more determined Viserys is to demean and reject the Dothraki.\nWhere Dany is enjoying their travels to Vaes Dothrak and wouldn\u2019t mind staying\nwith the Dothraki for any number of days before sailing to Westeros, Viserys\npushes and pushes to get what he bought with Dany\u2019s marriage. He has no interest\nin living with the Dothraki, much less wearing their clothes and speaking their\nlanguage. This divide between them finally allows Dany to see Viserys for what\nhe truly is:</p><blockquote><p>He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful\nthing. Why had she never seen that before? There was a hollow place inside her\nwhere her fear had been.</p></blockquote><p>And seeing him for the pitiful man he\u2019s always been\nstarts to reshape how Daenerys sees herself. Like almost everyone from\nWesteros, Daenerys believes very strongly in two things: hereditary monarchy and\nthe divine right of the Targaryen dynasty. Yet she sees Viserys, who by both\nthose measures is the rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, and understands he\ndoesn\u2019t deserve it:</p><blockquote><p>Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. \u201cTruth\nnow. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?\u201d</p><p>Dany thought about that. \u201cHe would not be a very good\nking, would he?\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cMy brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d\nDany said. She had known that for a long time, she realized. She had known it\nall her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a whisper,\nbut now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear.</p><p>Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. \u201cYou think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could not lead an army even if my lord husband\ngave him one,\u201d Dany said. \u201cHe has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles\nhim as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. He will never\ntake us home\u201d. </p></blockquote><p>Before I continue, there is one thing I want to emphasize\n\u2013 Daenerys <i>never</i> gives up on her\nbrother. David Benioff and Dan Weiss trying to paint his death as a moral\nturning point for Daenerys is simply not true. She does put him in his place,\nlike when she takes his horse away from him, but those are not bad things; he\nphysically abuses her, and she removes him from her space by having him at the back\nof the <i>khalasar</i>. It was a logical and reasonable punishment for his behavior,\nespecially because as Khaleesi she could have had him killed for it. Up until\nhe tries to cut her child out of her, Dany never considers harming him and\ntries very hard to make him see reason. Even though she feels incredibly close\nto her dragon eggs, she offers them to Viserys as a last chance to make him\nhappy and to save his life.</p><p>While she didn\u2019t give up on him as her brother, she\ndid give up on him as her King:</p><blockquote><p>When her son sat the Iron Throne, she would see that\nhe had bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his\nKingsguard.</p></blockquote><p>I wish GRRM spent more time elaborating on this quote\nof Dany\u2019s, because it\u2019s fairly revolutionary. We know from being in Dany\u2019s head\nthat she has no intention of harming or killing Viserys; and yet, she sees her\nson sitting on the Iron Throne. Does she just assume he will do something\nstupid to get him killed on the way? Or has she removed him from the line of\nsuccession because he\u2019s a vicious idiot? I\u2019d like to know more on what Dany\u2019s\nhead space is at that moment. </p><p>It becomes very clear what her thoughts are once he\ndies, though:</p><blockquote><p><i>He\nwas no dragon</i>, Dany thought, curiously calm. <i>Fire cannot kill a dragon</i></p></blockquote><p>Because Daenerys believes in the monarchy and in the\ndivine right of Targaryens, she has to find a way to square Viserys being the \u201crightful\u201d\nKing and also being a monster she won\u2019t put on the Iron Throne. And the concept\nof being a \u201cdragon\u201d is how she does it. Viserys constantly called himself one,\nand Ser Jorah Mormont said her brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and once\nViserys dies Dany realizes she is the dragon. Of course, everyone else was\nusing \u201cthe dragon\u201d in more metaphorical terms, but it becomes clear a little\nlater in the story that Daenerys is much more literally a dragon. Viserys\u2019\ndeath is the first time we see Daenerys fully commit to who she is, the blood\nof the dragon. She rejects Viserys\u2019 version of her family and starts seeing\nherself and her son as the future of House Targaryen.</p><p>Part of her really starting to embrace herself as\nbeing the blood of the dragon, is because she wants to go home to Westeros:</p><blockquote><p>But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King\u2019s\nLanding and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built. It was\nDragonstone where she had been born. In her mind\u2019s eye, they burned with a\nthousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind\u2019s eye, all the\ndoors were red</p></blockquote><p>Before, when it was Viserys forcing Westeros on her,\nshe never wanted it. But being Khaleesi, Dany realizes that she does want what\nher family lost:</p><blockquote><p><i>If\nI were not the blood of the dragon</i>, she thought wistfully, <i>this could be my home</i>. She was khaleesi,\nshe had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve her, warriors to keep\nher safe, an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old.\n. . and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world. That\nshould be enough for any woman\u2026 but not for the dragon. With Viserys gone,\nDaenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and conquerors,\nand so too the child inside her. She must not forget. </p></blockquote><p>This is where some of Daenerys less charming qualities\nare coming out, as far as why and how she wants to take back the Seven\nKingdoms. Wanting power or having it are not inherently bad things, but the\nproblems start to show in how Daenerys wants to gain it. Her urge to conquer\nWesteros is explicitly tied to being Daenerys Targaryen; she wants to reclaim\nit in the name of \u201ckings and conquerors\u201d. There is no way to remove Daenerys\nfrom the long history of abuses Westeros had to suffer under Kings like Aegon\nthe Conqueror, Maegor the Cruel, Aegon the Unworthy, The Mad King Aerys, etc,\nbecause Daenerys is coming for the Iron Throne in their name. She\u2019s not just\nrelated to them, they are what drive her forward. Later books, and especially <i>A\nDance with Dragons</i>, will dive much more into what Fire &amp; Blood means to\nWesteros and Dany, but even in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> there is attention brought to the\nbloody history of House Targaryen. This passage also starts drawing attention\nto the two different people she is; there is Dany, who is a young girl eager\nfor home and love and happiness and belonging, then there is Daenerys Stormborn\nof the House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the\nCruel and old Valyria before them, the dragon\u2019s daughter. </p><p><b>Daughter of Dragons, Bride of Dragons, Mother\nof Dragons</b></p><p>Beyond Daenerys\u2019 familial connection to her house, there\nis a strong magical link to Daenerys and her dragons. Even though they aren\u2019t\nborn until the final chapter, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> really highlights the\nconnection she has to them. She receives her three eggs as a gift at her\nwedding to Khal Drogo:</p><blockquote><p>Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she\nhad ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors\nthat at first she thought they were crusted with jewels</p></blockquote><p>Right after this, Khal Drogo gifts her Dany\u2019s silver,\nwhich she rides and for the first time isn\u2019t afraid. There is a connection\ndrawn between Dany receiving her dragon eggs, and then receiving a mount she finally\nfeels comfortable on. For now, Dany will have to ride her silver, but soon her\ndragons will be her mount. </p><p>The parallels between Daenerys and her dragons are already\nvery clear as well. When she first gets her eggs, they are beautiful but\nseemingly dead; hard and lifeless stone nobody expects to hatch. Similarly,\nDaenerys is overlooked by those around her in favor of her brother Viserys, and she\u2019s seemingly dormant. She doesn\u2019t have any ambitions to cross the Narrow Sea and\ntake back the Iron Throne, and nobody is investing in her future. But instantly\nDaenerys feels something within the hard stone, and keeps them with her almost\nalways.</p><p>When she\u2019s at her lowest of lows on the Dothraki sea,\nat the height of Drogo\u2019s abuse and her feeling lost and unloved, it\u2019s the\ndragons that bring her back from the edge:</p><blockquote><p>Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon\ndream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There was only her and the\ndragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood,\nDany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth,\nthe flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her. She\nopened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it\ncleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear\nand blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and\nyet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce.</p></blockquote><p>After that dream, her chaffed thighs start to heal and\nshe can ride her silver much better than before. Mentally she also finds a new\nstrength and is able to keep going, which leads to her embracing the Dothraki.\nShe is able to draw actual strength from the eggs, and in return they also find\nstrength in her:</p><blockquote><p>She touched one, the largest of the three, running her\nhand lightly over the shell. <i>Black-and-scarlet</i>,\nshe thought, <i>like the dragon in my dream</i>.\nThe stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers\u2026 or was she still\ndreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously. </p></blockquote><p>As Dany starts to come into her own, her dragon eggs\nbegin heating up. Both her and her dragons are starting to wake up. And as the\nbook continues, Dany begins associating herself with dragons and as a dragon\nmore and more; first when Viserys dies, then when Robert sends assassins after\nher, and again when she is claiming the Lhazareen women as her slaves:</p><blockquote><p><i>The\nUsurper has woken the dragon now</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cThe dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As she grows more comfortable being the dragon, her\neggs slowly get closer and closer to coming alive and Daenerys feels called to\nthem:</p><blockquote><p>Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to\nthe fire and pushed it down amongst the burning coals. The black scales seemed\nto glow as they drank the heat. Flames licked against the stone with small red\ntongues. Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire. As\nshe stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled in her throat.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys also has dreams of literally becoming a\ndragon:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she\nfelt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the\nshadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The door loomed before her, the\nred door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding\nbehind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high\nand higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in\nterror from the shadow of her wings</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys being pregnant with her son also offers a lot\nof insight into what her future is as the last dragon. All of the prophecies\nand foreshadowing surrounding Rhaego are actually about Daenerys, and it\u2019s the\nstart of her destiny being intertwined with the beautiful horror of dragons:</p><blockquote><p>She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt\nthe child move within her \u2026 as if he were reaching out, brother to brother,\nblood to blood. \u201cYou are the dragon,\u201d Dany whispered to him,\n\u201cthe true dragon. I know it. I know it.\u201d And she smiled, and went to\nsleep dreaming of home.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cAs swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his\n<i>khalasar</i> covers the earth, men without number, with <i>arakhs</i> shining in their\nhands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies\nwill tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend\ntheir flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk\nmen in the stone tents will fear his name.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The first quote really affirms Daenerys\u2019 role in the story\nas the true dragon, the last dragon. In <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, as well as in <i>A\nStorm of Swords</i> and <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>, Daenerys has dreams of turning into\nRhaegar; while fandom argues what this means and there is plenty of different\nmeanings it could have, I personally believe the foreshadowing is that Daenerys\nis the last dragon. Many times in the story that role is given to Rhaegar, but\nwe see with Daenerys that she is more a dragon than he ever was.</p><p>The second quote is the prophecy given to Daenerys by\nthe <i>Dosh Khaleen</i> in Vaes Dothrak, where they name her son <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>. This prophecy is obviously about\nDaenerys; the Dosh Khaleen assumed the future they were seeing belonged to her\nson, but they were actually seeing Daenerys\u2019 own future. Rhaego dying makes it\nquite clear, but the prophecy referring to the Stallion Who Mounts the World as\n\u201c<i>fierce as a storm</i>\u201d really seals the deal; after all she is Daenerys <b>Stormborn</b>,\nnamed after the storm that destroyed her family\u2019s fleet. This prophecy is extremely\nominous, with lines like \u201c<i>His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will\nweep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief</i>\u201d and \u201c<i>milk men in the stone\ntents will fear his name</i>\u201d; this does not sound like Daenerys is going to be\nliberating Westeros (the \u201cstone tents\u201d is a reference to castles). The name this\n\u201cprince\u201d is given, <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>, is also very similar to\nanother prophecy of Martin\u2019s \u2013 the rape of Westeros Daenerys sees in the House\nof the Undying. The language used to describe how the Stallion comes to mount\nthe world is bloody and violent; wives crying for their husbands, men living in\nfear, etc. It\u2019s a very concerning look into the future.</p><p><b>If I Look Back I Am Lost</b></p><p>A lot of people had problems with <i>Game of Thrones\u2019</i>\ndepiction of Daenerys in s8, based on the idea that her dark turn came out of\nnowhere. And in no way am I defending the show\u2019s characterization of her, or\nthe portrayal of her dark turn, but a lot of that criticism has gotten carried\nover to Daenerys as she stands in GRRM\u2019s books, which is simply not true.\nDaenerys has struggled with darkness her entire arc, and it really comes to the\nforefront in her last several <i>A Game of Thrones</i> chapters.</p><p>The Dothraki raid of the Lhazareen village is a huge\nturning point for Daenerys. Once Robert attempts to have her assassinated, Dany\nis finally able to convince Khal Drogo to sail across the Narrow Sea and take\nthe Iron Throne for her and her son. To do this, the Khalasar attack a peaceful\nvillage and a rival <i>khalasar</i>, and it\u2019s Dany\u2019s first real look at what her war\nfor the Iron Throne will be like:</p><blockquote><p>Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the\nrye and lentils into the ground, while <i>arakhs</i> and arrows had sown a terrible\nnew crop and watered it with blood.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys see\u2019s Khal Drogo\u2019s men herding a young boy,\nteasing him until they get bored of the game and cut his head off. The men are\nalso raping women atop piles of their dead people, and it\u2019s sickening to her:</p><blockquote><p>It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them;\nshe remembered what terror felt like.</p></blockquote><p>As she continues to walk through the Dothraki\u2019s\ndestruction, she tries to steel herself to the horrors around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>I\nam the blood of the dragon</i>, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself\nas she turned her face away. She pressed her lips together and hardened her\nheart and rode on toward the gate.</p></blockquote><p>But as she realizes their captives will be sold into\nslavery, she breaks:</p><blockquote><p><i>Slaves</i>,\nDany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver\u2019s\nBay. She wanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. <i>This is war, this is what it looks like,\nthis is the price of the Iron Throne</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Notice what GRRM calls her here; in the first quote\nwhen she is able to harden her heart and ride forward she is \u201cDaenerys\nTargaryen\u201d, but in the second when she almost begins to cry GRRM softens and\ncalls her \u201cDany\u201d. I\u2019ll get into it more below, but Daenerys is constantly at\nodds with herself and those are the two versions of her. Remember when I said\nthe lemon tree is what Dany wants to want? There is a part of her that craves\nthat simplicity, but life keeps pushing and pulling her towards that other part\nof her, the blood of the dragon, the seed of kings and conquerors, the part of\nher that is Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.</p><p>But in this moment, Daenerys Targaryen loses. Dany,\nthe part of her that remembers what it\u2019s like to be terrified, to be a slave,\ndecides to turn back:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending\nsound, a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on. Dany\u2019s hand clenched\nhard around the reins, and she turned the silver\u2019s head. \u201cMake them stop,\u201d she commanded\nSer Jorah.</p></blockquote><p>Notice how this passage starts: <i>Behind them</i>. Daenerys has to <i>look\nback</i> to save Eroeh. By the end of this book, Daenerys has made \u201c<i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>\u201d into her life philosophy, and it\u2019s heartbreaking. Her last\ncouple of chapters tell the story of a good-hearted person trying to help\npeople and fix the mistake she\u2019s made, yet when it all goes south she learns\nall the wrong lessons. </p><p>When Daenerys tries to claim these women to save them,\nshe does it with all the naivety of a 14yo girl. We shouldn\u2019t expect her to\nknow what to do in these situations; she\u2019s a young girl and she has a very\nsimple understanding of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and more importantly she\nhas a very simple understanding of what is and isn\u2019t a slave. </p><p>One of the women she saves in this town is Mirri Maz\nDuur:</p><blockquote><p>They passed other women being raped. Each time Dany\nreined up, sent her <i>khas</i> to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave.\nOne of them, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany\nhaltingly in the Common Tongue. </p></blockquote><p>Mirri is the only woman who says thank you to Dany,\nwhereas the others are terrified that Dany has spared them for something worse.\nSo, when Mirri speaks up that she can help Khal Drogo, Dany stands up for her\nagainst the Dothraki and allows her to help him. The mental processes of Mirri\nMaz Duur are still actually very unclear, and I know a lot of people argue over\nwhen she decided what she was going to do and even what she actually did. But\nto me, it seems heavily implied that Mirri\u2019s original efforts were made in good\nfaith. Khal Drogo falls ill because he disregards every single one of Mirri\u2019s\ninstructions by ripping her poultice off, smearing his wound in mud, and\ndrinking wine and milk of the poppy heavily. When Dany calls Mirri to look at\nhim again, she instantly knows Drogo has ignored her:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dany admitted.</p><p>\u201cI made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and\nbound it in a lambskin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned, he said. He tore it off. The herbwomen\nmade him a new one, wet and soothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned, yes. There is great healing magic in fire,\neven your hairless men know that.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Mirri seems very genuine here, and lays out that Drogo\nignored everything she told him. It doesn\u2019t make logical sense that she could have\ndone this to him, considering he ripped her poultice off almost immediately and\npreceded to do all the things she told him not to. I think Mirri made a genuine\nattempt to help Drogo, either altruistically or as an attempt to gain favor\nwith her new master (Dany), and then is completely ignored, which seems to\nupset her. What also upsets her, is that Dany owns her:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou do not ask a slave,\u201d Mirri replied sharply, \u201cyou\ntell her.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As we progress further, I really want to encourage\nreaders to remember Mirri\u2019s perspective in this story. I won\u2019t dive too deep\ninto her motivations, because this is about Dany and Mirri really deserves a\nmeta of her own, but understanding her is key to understanding what GRRM is\ntrying to say at the climax of Dany\u2019s arc. Remember that Dany threw the first\npunch between them, and while Dany did try to help Mirri, Mirri tried equally\nto help Dany and Drogo and had her efforts thrown back in her face. </p><p>And while Mirri Maz Duur is entirely misleading at\npoints, she never lies to Dany and she tries to talk Dany out of it:</p><blockquote><p>Mirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied\nDaenerys through eyes as black as night. \u201cThere is a spell.\u201d Her voice was\nquiet, scarcely more than a whisper. \u201cBut it is hard, lady, and dark. Some\nwould say that death is cleaner. I learned the way in Asshai, and paid dear for\nthe lesson. My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The first time Dany thinks to herself \u201c<i>If I look back\nI am lost</i>\u201d, is when Mirri tells her she knew that the price to pay was Rhaego\nand did it anyway. I\u2019ve seen it argued that this is unclear or false, but I\ncompletely disagree. This quote here is evidence enough:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cDeath?\u201d Dany wrapped her arms around herself\nprotectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. \u201cMy death?\u201d She told herself\nshe would die for him, if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would\nnot be afraid. </p></blockquote><p>Dany dying for Drogo would certainly lead to Rhaego\u2019s\ndeath as well, since the sacrifice needs to happen before the night is done and\nDany has no thoughts of going into labor. This quote makes it even clearer:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mirri Maz Duur promised. \u201cNot your death, Khaleesi.\u201d\n</p><p>Dany trembled with relief. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>She agrees before Mirri tells her what the sacrifice\nis. Dany would have given up anything in that moment to save Khal Drogo. </p><p>Like I said earlier, she\nis still a very young girl here and doesn\u2019t have any reason to be able to\nhandle the weight that\u2019s been placed on her. But she gets incredibly focused on\nDrogo once he falls sick, and her care and compassion for anyone else seems to\ndisappear:</p><blockquote><p>Eroeh stared fearfully at\nDrogo where he lay. \u201cHe dies,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Dany slapped her.</p></blockquote><p>Eroeh is the girl\nDaenerys saw gang raped atop a pile of corpses, the girl who\u2019s wails turned Dany\naround. </p><p>After everything goes so\nhorribly wrong, when Drogo\u2019s men turn against her and Jorah brings her into the\ntent with Mirri and she loses Rhaego and Drogo and wakes up with nothing, Mirri\ntells her this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI spoke for you,\u201d she\nsaid, anguished. \u201cI saved you.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Saved</i> me?\u201d The Lhazareen woman spat. \u201cThree riders had taken me,\nnot as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth\nwas in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god\u2019s house\nburn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well,\nand in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my\nbread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons\npast. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips.\nTell me again what you saved.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour life.\u201d </p><p>Mirri Maz Duur laughed\ncruelly. \u201cLook to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is\ngone.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Mirri obviously makes\nsome morally dubious decisions, but there is a lot of truth in what she tells\nDaenerys. What Dany viewed as saving, Mirri sees as a pitiful gesture; the damage\nwas already done before Dany changed her mind, and she didn\u2019t see or understand\nthat. If Daenerys was in a more understanding mindset, Mirri has a great lesson\nto teach her about how you treat people, especially your slaves (because yes,\nMirri is Dany\u2019s slave). </p><p>That\u2019s not the lesson\nDany learns though, she learns <i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>; which is a callback to a passage from her earlier chapters:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them the great\nhorde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking\ndust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant</p></blockquote><p>Deciding not to look back\nis a decision Dany makes so she doesn\u2019t have to face the reality of her choices\nand mistakes. Everything is okay if she doesn\u2019t turn back, if she doesn\u2019t see\nthe way her actions sow a crop of blood in the soil. But like I said, Dany\u2019s\nbest moments come when she looks behind her. If she didn\u2019t look back for Eroeh,\nshe would have left women to be raped and sold into slavery. Especially when we\nget to <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and<i> A Dance with Dragons</i>, it\u2019s just so clear that\nlooking back is essential to Dany\u2019s morality. She tries not to through those\nbooks, but she can\u2019t stop herself. Yet every time she does, she hates it. She\nhates that she saved Mirri Maz Duur and cost herself so much in the process. That\u2019s\nwhy she tells herself <i>If I look back I am\nlost</i>, to remember to never look back again. </p><p><b>Waking the Dragon</b></p><p>This is the climax of\nDany\u2019s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>; everything in her chapters is leading her to\nthe moment she steps into Drogo\u2019s funeral pyre. From her first chapter, she\ndreams of her dragons:</p><blockquote><p><i>There\nare no more dragons</i>, Dany thought, staring at her brother,\nthough she did not dare say it aloud.</p><p>Yet that night she dreamt\nof one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear.\nShe ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again.\nShe stumbled and fell. \u201cYou woke the dragon,\u201d he screamed as he kicked her. \u201cYou\nwoke the dragon, you woke the dragon.\u201d Her thighs were slick with blood. She\nclosed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping\nsound and the <i>crackling</i> of some great\nfire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all\naround, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head\nslowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a\nfine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid\u2026</p></blockquote><p>Her next dream has a much\nmore positive feel, but carries the same language:</p><blockquote><p>She opened her arms to\nthe fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper\nher and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough\naway, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam</p></blockquote><p>This dream really reminds\nme of GRRM\u2019s inspiration for his title, <i>Fire and Ice</i> by Robert Frost:</p><blockquote><p>Some say the world will\nend in fire/Some say in ice/From what I\u2019ve tasted of desire/I hold with those\nwho favor fire</p></blockquote><p>When Dany is in Mirri\u2019s\ntent, her dreams start to take on a very ominous tone:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain\nripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of\nburning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The\ndoor loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur\naround her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew\nacross the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all\nthat lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings</p><p>\u2026</p><p>She woke to the taste of\nashes.</p></blockquote><p>The progression of her\ndreams tell an interesting story. At first, when Daenerys wants no part of\nViserys\u2019 dreams or the Seven Kingdoms, the dragon in her dream terrifies her\nand she wakes more scared than she\u2019s ever been. But when the dream comes to her\non the Dothraki sea, after she\u2019s received her eggs as a wedding gift, she\nembraces the dragon in her dream; lets the fire mold and shape her, burn away\nher fear and hurt. And when she\u2019s fever dreaming in Mirri\u2019s tent, she takes the\nnext step and becomes the dragon; flying over Westeros, chasing the red door. As\nDany progresses through <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, she slowly embraces the dragon until\nshe is ready to hatch them in her final chapter.</p><p>What\u2019s most interesting\nis the framing of what that means. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that we are\nintroduced to the concept of \u201c<i>waking the dragon</i>\u201d through Viserys\u2019 threats to\nDaenerys. From the first chapter, we\u2019re meant to understand that waking the\ndragon is really bad for Daenerys. She tries her hardest <i>not</i> to wake the dragon, because something very bad will happen to\nher if she does. And her first dream of the dragon from her second chapter\nfeeds into this narrative; the dragon seeks to burn her.</p><p>In her second dream, she\nis much more comfortable standing before the dragon; but it\u2019s important to realize\nthat nothing has changed in the structure of the dream. Her dragon still wants\nto burn her, but now she finds strength in that; let this dragon burn away her\nweakness and temper her strength. She\u2019s starting to grow closer to her eggs,\nand also more comfortable with her heritage. Being with the Dothraki stripped her\nof everything except herself, and she\u2019s starting to fall back on that for strength.</p><p>A lot of time passes before\nshe has her last and final dream before hatching her dragons, and the tone has\nnow changed. She isn\u2019t standing before the dragon; she is the dragon. In her\ndream, she hears Viserys saying \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?\u201d\nand as she dreams it slowly falls away until all she hears is \u201cwake the dragon\u201d.\nThrough her travels on the Dothraki Sea, she\u2019s gone from a scared girl cowering\nbefore the dragon, to the one flying overhead, making every living thing\ntremble in fear.</p><p>She has gone from Dany to\nDaenerys Targaryen. </p><p>And this isn\u2019t supposed to\nbe a good thing. Like I said, it\u2019s not a coincidence that we\u2019re introduced to \u201c<i>waking\nthe dragon</i>\u201d as something Dany should fear. The imagery of her dreams is very\nclear; Dany is burned away, and in the ashes rises Daenerys Targaryen, Queen\nand Conqueror. </p><p>The most ominous and\nforeboding part of how Daenerys wakes the dragons, is of course the sacrifice\nshe makes to hatch them. It\u2019s pretty clear in the text, but confirmed by GRRM\nin interviews, that Daenerys is able to walk into the fire unscathed and hatch\nher dragons because of blood magic. She has already lost Drogo and Rhaego\npermanently at this point, so I don\u2019t take issue with using their deaths towards\nsaving herself, but the sacrifice of Mirri is entirely different. I want to\nestablish that Daenerys knows what she is doing when she chooses to burn Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI remember what you told\nme. Only death can pay for life.\u201d </p></blockquote><p>I\u2019ve seen many people who\nargue that Daenerys would eventually turn dark use this quote as one of the\nfirst signs:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou will not hear me scream,\u201d\nMirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Dany said</p></blockquote><p>But to me, the end of\nthat sentence is much more frightening:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cbut it is not your\nscreams I want, only your life.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys understands that\nMirri\u2019s death is paying for her dragons, and that\u2019s <i>why</i> she does it. I would\nunderstand, I would be <i>less</i> worried for\nDany, if her killing Mirri was a rash decision made out of grief, exhaustion,\npure rage; but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a cold, rational, <i>calm</i> decision; she thinks about it, understands it, <i>and then</i> burns Mirri alive. </p><p>Remember when I said\nMirri had a valuable lesson to teach Daenerys, and Daenerys learned all the\nwrong things? This is what she learned, that only death can pay for life. Instead\nof hearing Mirri\u2019s critique on what Dany was complicit in, Daenerys takes it to\nheart that death should not be meaningless; not in the way that life is\nprecious and therefore should be preserved, but in the way that she should get\nsomething out of it \u2013 in this case dragons. </p><p>I also want to call\nattention to what Mirri is to Daenerys. A lot of Daenerys\u2019 more adamant\ndefenders will call back to the same argument every time: Daenerys kills\nslavers. Killing bad men, even if in brutal fashion, cannot just suddenly\nchange into killing the innocent and oppressed. But remember, Mirri is where it\nall started; yes Daenerys was in some way involved in the brutality that befell\nthe Lhazareen people, but it is clear she didn\u2019t have a full understanding of\nwhat she was asking when she said she wanted to take the Iron Throne, and turned\nback on her decision to try and help the girls. Burning Mirri Maz Duur is the\nfirst death that is the direct result of Daenerys\u2019 choice (Viserys\u2019 death was\nthe result of <i>his </i>choices). And who\nwas Mirri to Daenerys? </p><p><b><i>Her slave.</i></b></p><p>This decision also\nhighlights a certain capacity for cruelty. I previously mentioned that Daenerys\nslaps Eroeh, the girl she saw gang raped only days prior, and again she shows\nsomething similar with Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI am tired of the maegi\u2019s\nbraying,\u201d Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife\nkept silent.</p></blockquote><p>I understand that Mirri\nhas taken Rhaego from Daenerys, but it shows a certain tunnel vision Daenerys has\nthat she cannot understanding that much more was taken from Mirri before the\nmaegi resorted in blood magic. </p><p>This kind of tunnel\nvision Daenerys is something she has through all the books, Daznak\u2019s Pit being\nthe clearest example, and <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is no different. The simultaneous\nhorror and beauty of Daenerys\u2019 blaze is breathtaking. Something horrific is\ntaking place; the horse murdered for Drogo is burning, Mirri Maz Duur is\nscreaming, Jorah and the Dothraki are shouting and crying. Yet the language is\nbeautiful:</p><blockquote><p>Huge orange gouts of fire\nunfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking,\nglowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn\nfireflies</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames writhed before\nher like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and\nspinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames were so beautiful,\nthe loveliest things she had ever seen, each on a sorcerer robed in yellow and\norange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and\ngreat yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame</p></blockquote><p>You can almost forget the\nhorror of Mirri burning, because the flames are just so beautiful to Daenerys.\nThe flames are described like dancers, floating and swirling and captivating\nher; everything else doesn\u2019t matter anymore, only the flames. Yet GRRM doesn\u2019t\nlet us fully forget:</p><blockquote><p>The pyre roared in the\ndeepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri\nMaz Duur\u2019s screaming</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She heard the screams of\nfrightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and\nterror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. <i>No</i>, she wanted to shout to\nhim, <i>no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys\nStormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don\u2019t you\nsee? Don\u2019t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not trying to say\nthat Daenerys is a bad person now. She still has so many redeeming qualities;\nshe still cares deeply for people, fights against slavery, wants to help her\npeople. In lesser fiction, character arcs on a graph are a straight line headed\nup or down, but GRRM is writing a masterpiece. He has no interest in clean arcs\nbecause real people are not one note; if you plotted a real person\u2019s choices\nout on a graph, it would be a series of small ups and downs while still\ntrending one direction, there could even be massive rises or falls because real\npeople slip and regress as they fall into old habits. Daenerys is on a path\nleading to a dark turn, but she still has many highs left to go. The speech she\ngives to the Dothraki before she lights Drogo\u2019s pyre is evidence of this; she\nlooks out and sees her people, those rejected by the <i>khalasar</i> that left her.\nThe old, the children, the women, the sick or crippled; and she embraces them.\nDaenerys is fiercely loyal to this group of people who still stood by her after\neveryone else left her. And she sets them free; Daenerys\u2019 new<i> khalasar</i> will not\nbe built on the backs of slaves.</p><p>But the dragons call to\nher, and she can\u2019t say no to them. <i>She is the blood of the dragon, and the fire\nis in her.</i> Daenerys wants many things, like peace and home and trees, but all of\nthose things fall away when she sees the glory and bane of her house. When she\nstands in the pyre, everything else falls away; the roaring and cracking of the\nfire and her dragons hatching drowns out the screams and shrieks and cries. The\nfire dances in her eyes and pulls her forward. Her dragons are beautiful and\nterrible, awe inspiring and fear inducing. They will always be both, just as Daenerys\nherself has always had both callings inside her, and it is very fitting that\nher <i>A Game of Thrones</i> arc should end here</p><p><i>For the first time in\nhundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.</i></p>",
                "content": "<p>Due to&hellip;recent events&hellip;I think it&rsquo;s important to\ngo back through George RR Martin&rsquo;s books and really understand what he was trying\nto say with Daenerys Targaryen. She occupies the same space in the narrative\nthat Jon Snow does, where she&rsquo;s just stereotypical enough, just fantasy trope\nenough, that people take for granted who her character is and what she\nrepresents. But, like Jon, if you read her chapters with an open mind, you&rsquo;ll\nnotice all of these great subversions and character traits that you miss the\nfirst time.</p><p>Breaking down the journey she takes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, GRRM lays a lot of\ntracks for where the story will take her&hellip; </p><p><b>The Outsider</b></p><p>The first thing about Daenerys is that she is\ninstantly an outsider. GRRM loves writing outsiders, and a huge amount of the\nPOV&rsquo;s in book one are introduced as an outsider in some way; Jon being a\nbastard in a society driven by status, Arya as a tomboy in a patriarchal\nsociety, Sansa as someone who doesn&rsquo;t fit with her family, Tyrion as a dwarf in\nan ableist society, and so on. Daenerys takes this concept to its extreme; not\nonly is she an outsider within her own world, she is an outsider within the\nnarrative. All the POVs we&rsquo;ll have in this book were the victors of Robert&rsquo;s\nRebellion. They may have lost things (like Ned losing Lyanna) but Robert&rsquo;s\nRebellion worked for them in a way that they either ended up better off than\nbefore, or received some form of justice for the wrongs they&rsquo;d suffered.&nbsp;</p><p>But\nDaenerys <i>lost</i>. She was supposed to be\na Princess, to grow up in the Red Keep with an entire kingdom at her feet. Instead, we are introduced to a young girl who hasn&rsquo;t truly known a home her\nwhole life, a girl who thinks she was chased around a continent by assassins\nout to take her life. We know, because we&rsquo;ve lived inside Eddard Stark&rsquo;s head,\nthat Daenerys&rsquo; family was unequivocally on the wrong side of Robert&rsquo;s\nRebellion, but suddenly we understand that even in a just war, innocent people\nwill get ruined.</p><p>So, with Daenerys being the lone Targaryen POV we\nhave, it creates a sort of dissonance where she is portrayed as sympathetic,\nyet is the natural enemy to the Starks who are our heroes. When her brother\nViserys tells her these awful stories of &ldquo;<i>the Usurper and his dogs</i>&rdquo;, we know\nshe&rsquo;s being lied to because we know Eddard Stark, but yet we have to sympathize\nwith this child who was supposed to have everything and, instead, was left with\nnothing. Like Tyrion, we as a reader don&rsquo;t quite know how to feel about her,\nbecause she is the antagonist of our heroes, but when you see things from her\nperspective suddenly this black and white war turns into a hundred different\nshades of grey. </p><p><b>The House With The Red Door</b></p><p>Moving from what her existence means to the narrative,\nwe begin to understand what Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion did to her as a person. The\nfirst we see of her, she is feeling a dress so soft it scares her, as her\nbrother Viserys tells her she must look like a princess:</p><blockquote><p><i>A\nPrincess</i>, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like.\nPerhaps she had never really known.</p></blockquote><p>For the first time in her life, she&rsquo;s starting to get\na real taste of what she lost as a child, and she&rsquo;s scared. It becomes clear\nthat Viserys is an abuser in her life, and seeing him so fevered is terrifying.\nFor the first time in his life, he&rsquo;s been given a clear path to reclaim the\nSeven Kingdoms and the Iron Throne that by rights should be his. Viserys was old\nenough to remember Dragonstone and King&rsquo;s Landing and the throne he lost; these\nare all tangible things that he can remember, that he knows someone stole from\nhim.</p><p>But Daenerys doesn&rsquo;t have that connection to Westeros.\nShe wasn&rsquo;t even born when her mother retreated to Dragonstone, and just a baby\nwhen Willem Darry smuggled her and her brother to Essos. Home is a very loose\nconcept that Daenerys can never firmly grasp because she never truly had one.\nShe understands that she was never allowed to just be a child, but she can&rsquo;t\nplace where it all went wrong. Viserys has this clear line, when he was 8 and a\nPrince and had everything; then suddenly everyone he knew was dead and he had\nnothing. Daenerys doesn&rsquo;t have that; all she has is this memory of a house with\na red door.</p><p>This house with the red door is so important to her,\nbecause it is the closest she has ever gotten to home; the one place she can\nlook back on and feel like she had what she was supposed to:</p><blockquote><p>She remembered Ser Willem\ndimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders\nfrom his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always\nbeen kind to Dany. He called her &ldquo;Little Princess&rdquo; and sometime &ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo;&hellip;\nThat was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany\nhad her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. </p></blockquote><p>Yet, Daenerys knows that wasn&rsquo;t really her home,\njust the closest she has come. Her character will chase that feeling, of being\nsafe and in control and having things, for the rest of the books. The house\nwith the red door works so well as a writing device from GRRM, because it is this\nvague idea of a thing; from the beginning it is clear that Daenerys herself\ndoesn&rsquo;t really understand why this house with a red door appeals so much to\nher, so she can never get that feeling back. From the start, Daenerys is\nchasing this thing that we know she can never have. What she does when <i>she</i>\nrealizes that, is a question for later books.</p><p>But what, from a Doylist perspective, is this house\nwith a red door supposed to be? Daenerys thinks it is home, but the symbolism\nof this house is childhood and innocence. The things Daenerys remembers fondly\nabout it are important; Ser Willem calling her &ldquo;princess&rdquo;, the lemon tree,\nhaving her own room. The first is very important, because being a princess is\nwhat Viserys has filled her head with &ndash; it&rsquo;s the childhood Daenerys knows she\nwas owed by blood. The lemon tree is a bit more complicated; <i>A Dance With\nDragons</i> will really start breaking down Daenerys and trees and all the imagery\nthat goes with her arc, but trees is what Dany <i>wants</i> to want. To watch the lemon tree grow, is to spend years in\nthe same place. And trees also need peace to grow; you have to love and care\nfor a lemon tree. Having her own room also means that Daenerys was well off. Safe, comfortable, and well-off princesses have their own room with a lemon\ntree outside. So while the house with the red door represents childhood and\ninnocence, I also think it&rsquo;s important to recognize that it also represents\nDany&rsquo;s longing for her life of royalty. She doesn&rsquo;t have the same murderous\nvengeance as Viserys, but she has that same passion for what was taken from\nher; a sort of blinding desire that gets in the way of seeing things clearly,\nespecially when it comes to understanding that the Iron Throne wasn&rsquo;t stolen\nfrom her family &ndash; they murdered it away chasing dragons. </p><p>Speaking of Daenerys&rsquo; connection to home, there is some interesting symbolism at play when\nDaenerys visits the markets. Daenerys loves the\nsights and smells of the Eastern market, the excitement of trying and seeing\nnew things, experiencing something foreign. But she turns toward the\nWestern market because it smells of home. When she was younger and went to the\nbazaar with Viserys, they hardly ever had enough money to buy anything but a\ncertain type of sausage that Daenerys remembers fondly. She finds it again with\nher handmaidens and <i>khas</i>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;They taste different than I remember,&rdquo; Dany said\nafter her first few bites.</p><p>&ldquo;In Pentos, I make them with pork,&rdquo; the old woman\nsaid, &ldquo;but all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea. These are made of horsemeat,\nKhaleesi, but I spice them the same.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dany felt disappointed</p></blockquote><p>Something is lost on the Dothraki sea, and home will\nnever be the same again.</p><p><b>She Forgot To Be Afraid</b></p><p>The header has a hopeful sound to it, and the tail end\nof Dany&rsquo;s first chapters do as well, but the first part of her story is\nincredibly bleak. Fear is such a heavy element in Dany&rsquo;s story, partially\nbecause it really sets up the decisions she&rsquo;ll make in her final chapters, but\nmostly because it is the reason for her character growth. Once Dany finds her\nplace and begins leading as a Khaleesi, we start to see her true personality\ncome out and she is a person again. But for the first few chapters, Dany has\nalmost none of the character traits that later define her, because fear has\nsuppressed them. Living under Viserys as she grew up, constantly dancing around\nhis &ldquo;dragon&rdquo;, she had no space to be the bold, fierce, avenging girl she ends <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i> as. A couple of her traits really shine through in these first\nchapters, like how much more intelligent and perceptive she is compared to\nViserys and some of the adults around her, because her others characteristics\nhave been put on hold; but it&rsquo;s really just tragic to read about Dany&rsquo;s life up\nto this point. Viserys has lied to her (unintentionally, since he is\ndelusional, but&hellip;) and made her think she&rsquo;s only been one step ahead of\nassassins her whole life, and then turned around and abused her for things out\nof her control (like her mother Rhaella dying in childbirth, or how he sold\ntheir mother&rsquo;s crown to feed her):</p><blockquote><p>His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts\nand tightened on a nipple. &ldquo;You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go\nhard for you. You don&rsquo;t want to wake the dragon, do you?&rdquo; His fingers twisted\nher, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal\nDrogo&rsquo;s army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for\nthat, you will.&rdquo; He smiled at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let his whole <i>khalasar</i> fuck you if need\nbe, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what\nit took to get my army. Be grateful it is only Drogo.</p></blockquote><p>The picture this paints of what Viserys has been like\nto Daenerys for years now is shocking (later books will also elaborate that\nViserys tried to rape her in the days after this, but Ilyrio&rsquo;s men stopped\nhim). And like I said earlier, the way Dany has to avoid waking his dragon\nconsumes all of her mental energy. Between trying not to anger him, and longing\nfor days before he became so cruel, there simply isn&rsquo;t anymore left Dany can\ngive.</p><p><b>The Blood of the Dragon</b></p><p>From the very first chapter, Viserys introduces us to\na core concept of GRRM&rsquo;s world, and for lack of a better name, I&rsquo;d call it\nTargaryen entitlement. Even after Viserys dies demanding he be crowned in <i>A\nGame of Thrones</i>, we aren&rsquo;t even close to understanding the full reach of\nTargaryens overstepping in the name of themselves.<i> Fire and Blood Volume I</i>\nshows us that Aegon conquered a whole continent to get his relative a girl,\nwhether she wanted him or no. That&rsquo;s the kind of history standing behind\nViserys when he threatens Dany with Drogo&rsquo;s <i>khalasar</i>.</p><p>But for now, Viserys is our look inside what led to\nthe implosion of the Targaryen dynasty, and it&rsquo;s not pretty:</p><blockquote><p>The dragon does not beg</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You do not command the dragon</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon speaks as he likes</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The dragon is not mocked</p></blockquote><p>And Daenerys&rsquo; inner monologue gives some context as to\nwhy &ldquo;the dragon&rdquo; sees himself as so far above the rest:</p><blockquote><p>Dragons did not mate with\nthe beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of\nlesser men.</p></blockquote><p>Later books and the extended canon will elaborate on\nthis concept further, as we learn the Targaryens are quite literally the blood\nof the dragon (which is why their severe inbreeding leads to dragon/human\nhybrid babies); but the important thing here is that Viserys views himself as a\nGod amongst men, a majestic beast unfit to mingle with the sheep. This god\ncomplex gives us an understanding of why the Targaryens act the way they do,\nthough; when you&rsquo;re so high above everyone else, their lives start to matter\nless and less. </p><p>The idea that Targaryens are inherently better than\neveryone else, drives Viserys as much as his own victimization does:</p><blockquote><p>Ours by blood right&hellip;You do not steal from the\ndragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers</p></blockquote><p>Viserys&rsquo; language is filled with quotes like this. While\nhe does talk of getting revenge for his brother Rhaegar, or killing the usurper\nwho sits on his father&rsquo;s throne, an equal amount of his anger is focused on\nbeing a dragon. Not only did the Usurper take what belonged to him, but he\ndared to think himself equal to a dragon. </p><p>And Daenerys does not seem particularly interested in\neither of these things:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Please, <i>please</i>,\nViserys, I don&rsquo;t want to, I want to go home.&rdquo;&hellip;Dany had only meant their\nrooms in Illyrio&rsquo;s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother\ndid not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house\nwith the red door had not been home for him.</p></blockquote><p>From the beginning, Dany has found strength in being\nDaenerys Targaryen, but not in the way Viserys did. She is empowered by it because\nit gives her a sense of identity; even though she doesn&rsquo;t have a real home or\nreal friends or anybody, she knows who she is. Daenerys Stormborn of the House\nTargaryen is not meaningless, she is important; and Dany needs that to hold\nonto. Her last name cost her so much, but it&rsquo;s also what keeps her going.</p><p>Once her relationship with Viserys starts to fall\napart, Daenerys&rsquo; relationship to being a Targaryen starts to change. When\nDaenerys embraces the <i>khalasar</i>, she suddenly becomes very powerful; as long as\nKhal Drogo is alive, all the men must follow her commands or risk their Khal&rsquo;s\nwrath. And being Khaleesi also gives Daenerys a certain sense of place; it&rsquo;s\nnever going to be home to her, but she belongs there much more than she&rsquo;s ever\nbelonged anywhere else. She fully begins to embrace their customs by dressing\nas they do, learning to speak Dothraki, and respecting their sacred beliefs. For\nthe first time in many years she feels comfortable, and she can&rsquo;t understand why\nViserys won&rsquo;t at least try and join her. The more Dany finds a place for\nherself, the more determined Viserys is to demean and reject the Dothraki.\nWhere Dany is enjoying their travels to Vaes Dothrak and wouldn&rsquo;t mind staying\nwith the Dothraki for any number of days before sailing to Westeros, Viserys\npushes and pushes to get what he bought with Dany&rsquo;s marriage. He has no interest\nin living with the Dothraki, much less wearing their clothes and speaking their\nlanguage. This divide between them finally allows Dany to see Viserys for what\nhe truly is:</p><blockquote><p>He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful\nthing. Why had she never seen that before? There was a hollow place inside her\nwhere her fear had been.</p></blockquote><p>And seeing him for the pitiful man he&rsquo;s always been\nstarts to reshape how Daenerys sees herself. Like almost everyone from\nWesteros, Daenerys believes very strongly in two things: hereditary monarchy and\nthe divine right of the Targaryen dynasty. Yet she sees Viserys, who by both\nthose measures is the rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, and understands he\ndoesn&rsquo;t deserve it:</p><blockquote><p>Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. &ldquo;Truth\nnow. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?&rdquo;</p><p>Dany thought about that. &ldquo;He would not be a very good\nking, would he?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,&rdquo;\nDany said. She had known that for a long time, she realized. She had known it\nall her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a whisper,\nbut now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear.</p><p>Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. &ldquo;You think not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He could not lead an army even if my lord husband\ngave him one,&rdquo; Dany said. &ldquo;He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles\nhim as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. He will never\ntake us home&rdquo;. </p></blockquote><p>Before I continue, there is one thing I want to emphasize\n&ndash; Daenerys <i>never</i> gives up on her\nbrother. David Benioff and Dan Weiss trying to paint his death as a moral\nturning point for Daenerys is simply not true. She does put him in his place,\nlike when she takes his horse away from him, but those are not bad things; he\nphysically abuses her, and she removes him from her space by having him at the back\nof the <i>khalasar</i>. It was a logical and reasonable punishment for his behavior,\nespecially because as Khaleesi she could have had him killed for it. Up until\nhe tries to cut her child out of her, Dany never considers harming him and\ntries very hard to make him see reason. Even though she feels incredibly close\nto her dragon eggs, she offers them to Viserys as a last chance to make him\nhappy and to save his life.</p><p>While she didn&rsquo;t give up on him as her brother, she\ndid give up on him as her King:</p><blockquote><p>When her son sat the Iron Throne, she would see that\nhe had bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his\nKingsguard.</p></blockquote><p>I wish GRRM spent more time elaborating on this quote\nof Dany&rsquo;s, because it&rsquo;s fairly revolutionary. We know from being in Dany&rsquo;s head\nthat she has no intention of harming or killing Viserys; and yet, she sees her\nson sitting on the Iron Throne. Does she just assume he will do something\nstupid to get him killed on the way? Or has she removed him from the line of\nsuccession because he&rsquo;s a vicious idiot? I&rsquo;d like to know more on what Dany&rsquo;s\nhead space is at that moment. </p><p>It becomes very clear what her thoughts are once he\ndies, though:</p><blockquote><p><i>He\nwas no dragon</i>, Dany thought, curiously calm. <i>Fire cannot kill a dragon</i></p></blockquote><p>Because Daenerys believes in the monarchy and in the\ndivine right of Targaryens, she has to find a way to square Viserys being the &ldquo;rightful&rdquo;\nKing and also being a monster she won&rsquo;t put on the Iron Throne. And the concept\nof being a &ldquo;dragon&rdquo; is how she does it. Viserys constantly called himself one,\nand Ser Jorah Mormont said her brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and once\nViserys dies Dany realizes she is the dragon. Of course, everyone else was\nusing &ldquo;the dragon&rdquo; in more metaphorical terms, but it becomes clear a little\nlater in the story that Daenerys is much more literally a dragon. Viserys&rsquo;\ndeath is the first time we see Daenerys fully commit to who she is, the blood\nof the dragon. She rejects Viserys&rsquo; version of her family and starts seeing\nherself and her son as the future of House Targaryen.</p><p>Part of her really starting to embrace herself as\nbeing the blood of the dragon, is because she wants to go home to Westeros:</p><blockquote><p>But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King&rsquo;s\nLanding and the great Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built. It was\nDragonstone where she had been born. In her mind&rsquo;s eye, they burned with a\nthousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind&rsquo;s eye, all the\ndoors were red</p></blockquote><p>Before, when it was Viserys forcing Westeros on her,\nshe never wanted it. But being Khaleesi, Dany realizes that she does want what\nher family lost:</p><blockquote><p><i>If\nI were not the blood of the dragon</i>, she thought wistfully, <i>this could be my home</i>. She was khaleesi,\nshe had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve her, warriors to keep\nher safe, an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old.\n. . and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world. That\nshould be enough for any woman&hellip; but not for the dragon. With Viserys gone,\nDaenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and conquerors,\nand so too the child inside her. She must not forget. </p></blockquote><p>This is where some of Daenerys less charming qualities\nare coming out, as far as why and how she wants to take back the Seven\nKingdoms. Wanting power or having it are not inherently bad things, but the\nproblems start to show in how Daenerys wants to gain it. Her urge to conquer\nWesteros is explicitly tied to being Daenerys Targaryen; she wants to reclaim\nit in the name of &ldquo;kings and conquerors&rdquo;. There is no way to remove Daenerys\nfrom the long history of abuses Westeros had to suffer under Kings like Aegon\nthe Conqueror, Maegor the Cruel, Aegon the Unworthy, The Mad King Aerys, etc,\nbecause Daenerys is coming for the Iron Throne in their name. She&rsquo;s not just\nrelated to them, they are what drive her forward. Later books, and especially <i>A\nDance with Dragons</i>, will dive much more into what Fire &amp; Blood means to\nWesteros and Dany, but even in <i>A Game of Thrones</i> there is attention brought to the\nbloody history of House Targaryen. This passage also starts drawing attention\nto the two different people she is; there is Dany, who is a young girl eager\nfor home and love and happiness and belonging, then there is Daenerys Stormborn\nof the House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the\nCruel and old Valyria before them, the dragon&rsquo;s daughter. </p><p><b>Daughter of Dragons, Bride of Dragons, Mother\nof Dragons</b></p><p>Beyond Daenerys&rsquo; familial connection to her house, there\nis a strong magical link to Daenerys and her dragons. Even though they aren&rsquo;t\nborn until the final chapter, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> really highlights the\nconnection she has to them. She receives her three eggs as a gift at her\nwedding to Khal Drogo:</p><blockquote><p>Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she\nhad ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors\nthat at first she thought they were crusted with jewels</p></blockquote><p>Right after this, Khal Drogo gifts her Dany&rsquo;s silver,\nwhich she rides and for the first time isn&rsquo;t afraid. There is a connection\ndrawn between Dany receiving her dragon eggs, and then receiving a mount she finally\nfeels comfortable on. For now, Dany will have to ride her silver, but soon her\ndragons will be her mount. </p><p>The parallels between Daenerys and her dragons are already\nvery clear as well. When she first gets her eggs, they are beautiful but\nseemingly dead; hard and lifeless stone nobody expects to hatch. Similarly,\nDaenerys is overlooked by those around her in favor of her brother Viserys, and she&rsquo;s seemingly dormant. She doesn&rsquo;t have any ambitions to cross the Narrow Sea and\ntake back the Iron Throne, and nobody is investing in her future. But instantly\nDaenerys feels something within the hard stone, and keeps them with her almost\nalways.</p><p>When she&rsquo;s at her lowest of lows on the Dothraki sea,\nat the height of Drogo&rsquo;s abuse and her feeling lost and unloved, it&rsquo;s the\ndragons that bring her back from the edge:</p><blockquote><p>Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon\ndream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There was only her and the\ndragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood,\nDany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth,\nthe flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her. She\nopened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it\ncleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear\nand blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and\nyet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce.</p></blockquote><p>After that dream, her chaffed thighs start to heal and\nshe can ride her silver much better than before. Mentally she also finds a new\nstrength and is able to keep going, which leads to her embracing the Dothraki.\nShe is able to draw actual strength from the eggs, and in return they also find\nstrength in her:</p><blockquote><p>She touched one, the largest of the three, running her\nhand lightly over the shell. <i>Black-and-scarlet</i>,\nshe thought, <i>like the dragon in my dream</i>.\nThe stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers&hellip; or was she still\ndreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously. </p></blockquote><p>As Dany starts to come into her own, her dragon eggs\nbegin heating up. Both her and her dragons are starting to wake up. And as the\nbook continues, Dany begins associating herself with dragons and as a dragon\nmore and more; first when Viserys dies, then when Robert sends assassins after\nher, and again when she is claiming the Lhazareen women as her slaves:</p><blockquote><p><i>The\nUsurper has woken the dragon now</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>As she grows more comfortable being the dragon, her\neggs slowly get closer and closer to coming alive and Daenerys feels called to\nthem:</p><blockquote><p>Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to\nthe fire and pushed it down amongst the burning coals. The black scales seemed\nto glow as they drank the heat. Flames licked against the stone with small red\ntongues. Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire. As\nshe stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled in her throat.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys also has dreams of literally becoming a\ndragon:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she\nfelt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the\nshadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The door loomed before her, the\nred door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding\nbehind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high\nand higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in\nterror from the shadow of her wings</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys being pregnant with her son also offers a lot\nof insight into what her future is as the last dragon. All of the prophecies\nand foreshadowing surrounding Rhaego are actually about Daenerys, and it&rsquo;s the\nstart of her destiny being intertwined with the beautiful horror of dragons:</p><blockquote><p>She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt\nthe child move within her &hellip; as if he were reaching out, brother to brother,\nblood to blood. &ldquo;You are the dragon,&rdquo; Dany whispered to him,\n&ldquo;the true dragon. I know it. I know it.&rdquo; And she smiled, and went to\nsleep dreaming of home.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his\n<i>khalasar</i> covers the earth, men without number, with <i>arakhs</i> shining in their\nhands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies\nwill tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend\ntheir flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk\nmen in the stone tents will fear his name.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The first quote really affirms Daenerys&rsquo; role in the story\nas the true dragon, the last dragon. In <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, as well as in <i>A\nStorm of Swords</i> and <i>A Dance with Dragons</i>, Daenerys has dreams of turning into\nRhaegar; while fandom argues what this means and there is plenty of different\nmeanings it could have, I personally believe the foreshadowing is that Daenerys\nis the last dragon. Many times in the story that role is given to Rhaegar, but\nwe see with Daenerys that she is more a dragon than he ever was.</p><p>The second quote is the prophecy given to Daenerys by\nthe <i>Dosh Khaleen</i> in Vaes Dothrak, where they name her son <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>. This prophecy is obviously about\nDaenerys; the Dosh Khaleen assumed the future they were seeing belonged to her\nson, but they were actually seeing Daenerys&rsquo; own future. Rhaego dying makes it\nquite clear, but the prophecy referring to the Stallion Who Mounts the World as\n&ldquo;<i>fierce as a storm</i>&rdquo; really seals the deal; after all she is Daenerys <b>Stormborn</b>,\nnamed after the storm that destroyed her family&rsquo;s fleet. This prophecy is extremely\nominous, with lines like &ldquo;<i>His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will\nweep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>milk men in the stone\ntents will fear his name</i>&rdquo;; this does not sound like Daenerys is going to be\nliberating Westeros (the &ldquo;stone tents&rdquo; is a reference to castles). The name this\n&ldquo;prince&rdquo; is given, <i>The Stallion Who Mounts The World</i>, is also very similar to\nanother prophecy of Martin&rsquo;s &ndash; the rape of Westeros Daenerys sees in the House\nof the Undying. The language used to describe how the Stallion comes to mount\nthe world is bloody and violent; wives crying for their husbands, men living in\nfear, etc. It&rsquo;s a very concerning look into the future.</p><p><b>If I Look Back I Am Lost</b></p><p>A lot of people had problems with <i>Game of Thrones&rsquo;</i>\ndepiction of Daenerys in s8, based on the idea that her dark turn came out of\nnowhere. And in no way am I defending the show&rsquo;s characterization of her, or\nthe portrayal of her dark turn, but a lot of that criticism has gotten carried\nover to Daenerys as she stands in GRRM&rsquo;s books, which is simply not true.\nDaenerys has struggled with darkness her entire arc, and it really comes to the\nforefront in her last several <i>A Game of Thrones</i> chapters.</p><p>The Dothraki raid of the Lhazareen village is a huge\nturning point for Daenerys. Once Robert attempts to have her assassinated, Dany\nis finally able to convince Khal Drogo to sail across the Narrow Sea and take\nthe Iron Throne for her and her son. To do this, the Khalasar attack a peaceful\nvillage and a rival <i>khalasar</i>, and it&rsquo;s Dany&rsquo;s first real look at what her war\nfor the Iron Throne will be like:</p><blockquote><p>Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the\nrye and lentils into the ground, while <i>arakhs</i> and arrows had sown a terrible\nnew crop and watered it with blood.</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys see&rsquo;s Khal Drogo&rsquo;s men herding a young boy,\nteasing him until they get bored of the game and cut his head off. The men are\nalso raping women atop piles of their dead people, and it&rsquo;s sickening to her:</p><blockquote><p>It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them;\nshe remembered what terror felt like.</p></blockquote><p>As she continues to walk through the Dothraki&rsquo;s\ndestruction, she tries to steel herself to the horrors around her:</p><blockquote><p><i>I\nam the blood of the dragon</i>, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself\nas she turned her face away. She pressed her lips together and hardened her\nheart and rode on toward the gate.</p></blockquote><p>But as she realizes their captives will be sold into\nslavery, she breaks:</p><blockquote><p><i>Slaves</i>,\nDany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver&rsquo;s\nBay. She wanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. <i>This is war, this is what it looks like,\nthis is the price of the Iron Throne</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Notice what GRRM calls her here; in the first quote\nwhen she is able to harden her heart and ride forward she is &ldquo;Daenerys\nTargaryen&rdquo;, but in the second when she almost begins to cry GRRM softens and\ncalls her &ldquo;Dany&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll get into it more below, but Daenerys is constantly at\nodds with herself and those are the two versions of her. Remember when I said\nthe lemon tree is what Dany wants to want? There is a part of her that craves\nthat simplicity, but life keeps pushing and pulling her towards that other part\nof her, the blood of the dragon, the seed of kings and conquerors, the part of\nher that is Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.</p><p>But in this moment, Daenerys Targaryen loses. Dany,\nthe part of her that remembers what it&rsquo;s like to be terrified, to be a slave,\ndecides to turn back:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending\nsound, a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on. Dany&rsquo;s hand clenched\nhard around the reins, and she turned the silver&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Make them stop,&rdquo; she commanded\nSer Jorah.</p></blockquote><p>Notice how this passage starts: <i>Behind them</i>. Daenerys has to <i>look\nback</i> to save Eroeh. By the end of this book, Daenerys has made &ldquo;<i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>&rdquo; into her life philosophy, and it&rsquo;s heartbreaking. Her last\ncouple of chapters tell the story of a good-hearted person trying to help\npeople and fix the mistake she&rsquo;s made, yet when it all goes south she learns\nall the wrong lessons. </p><p>When Daenerys tries to claim these women to save them,\nshe does it with all the naivety of a 14yo girl. We shouldn&rsquo;t expect her to\nknow what to do in these situations; she&rsquo;s a young girl and she has a very\nsimple understanding of what&rsquo;s right and what&rsquo;s wrong, and more importantly she\nhas a very simple understanding of what is and isn&rsquo;t a slave. </p><p>One of the women she saves in this town is Mirri Maz\nDuur:</p><blockquote><p>They passed other women being raped. Each time Dany\nreined up, sent her <i>khas</i> to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave.\nOne of them, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany\nhaltingly in the Common Tongue. </p></blockquote><p>Mirri is the only woman who says thank you to Dany,\nwhereas the others are terrified that Dany has spared them for something worse.\nSo, when Mirri speaks up that she can help Khal Drogo, Dany stands up for her\nagainst the Dothraki and allows her to help him. The mental processes of Mirri\nMaz Duur are still actually very unclear, and I know a lot of people argue over\nwhen she decided what she was going to do and even what she actually did. But\nto me, it seems heavily implied that Mirri&rsquo;s original efforts were made in good\nfaith. Khal Drogo falls ill because he disregards every single one of Mirri&rsquo;s\ninstructions by ripping her poultice off, smearing his wound in mud, and\ndrinking wine and milk of the poppy heavily. When Dany calls Mirri to look at\nhim again, she instantly knows Drogo has ignored her:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dany admitted.</p><p>&ldquo;I made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and\nbound it in a lambskin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It burned, he said. He tore it off. The herbwomen\nmade him a new one, wet and soothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It burned, yes. There is great healing magic in fire,\neven your hairless men know that.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Mirri seems very genuine here, and lays out that Drogo\nignored everything she told him. It doesn&rsquo;t make logical sense that she could have\ndone this to him, considering he ripped her poultice off almost immediately and\npreceded to do all the things she told him not to. I think Mirri made a genuine\nattempt to help Drogo, either altruistically or as an attempt to gain favor\nwith her new master (Dany), and then is completely ignored, which seems to\nupset her. What also upsets her, is that Dany owns her:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You do not ask a slave,&rdquo; Mirri replied sharply, &ldquo;you\ntell her.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>As we progress further, I really want to encourage\nreaders to remember Mirri&rsquo;s perspective in this story. I won&rsquo;t dive too deep\ninto her motivations, because this is about Dany and Mirri really deserves a\nmeta of her own, but understanding her is key to understanding what GRRM is\ntrying to say at the climax of Dany&rsquo;s arc. Remember that Dany threw the first\npunch between them, and while Dany did try to help Mirri, Mirri tried equally\nto help Dany and Drogo and had her efforts thrown back in her face. </p><p>And while Mirri Maz Duur is entirely misleading at\npoints, she never lies to Dany and she tries to talk Dany out of it:</p><blockquote><p>Mirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied\nDaenerys through eyes as black as night. &ldquo;There is a spell.&rdquo; Her voice was\nquiet, scarcely more than a whisper. &ldquo;But it is hard, lady, and dark. Some\nwould say that death is cleaner. I learned the way in Asshai, and paid dear for\nthe lesson. My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The first time Dany thinks to herself &ldquo;<i>If I look back\nI am lost</i>&rdquo;, is when Mirri tells her she knew that the price to pay was Rhaego\nand did it anyway. I&rsquo;ve seen it argued that this is unclear or false, but I\ncompletely disagree. This quote here is evidence enough:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Death?&rdquo; Dany wrapped her arms around herself\nprotectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. &ldquo;My death?&rdquo; She told herself\nshe would die for him, if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would\nnot be afraid. </p></blockquote><p>Dany dying for Drogo would certainly lead to Rhaego&rsquo;s\ndeath as well, since the sacrifice needs to happen before the night is done and\nDany has no thoughts of going into labor. This quote makes it even clearer:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mirri Maz Duur promised. &ldquo;Not your death, Khaleesi.&rdquo;\n</p><p>Dany trembled with relief. &ldquo;Do it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>She agrees before Mirri tells her what the sacrifice\nis. Dany would have given up anything in that moment to save Khal Drogo. </p><p>Like I said earlier, she\nis still a very young girl here and doesn&rsquo;t have any reason to be able to\nhandle the weight that&rsquo;s been placed on her. But she gets incredibly focused on\nDrogo once he falls sick, and her care and compassion for anyone else seems to\ndisappear:</p><blockquote><p>Eroeh stared fearfully at\nDrogo where he lay. &ldquo;He dies,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>Dany slapped her.</p></blockquote><p>Eroeh is the girl\nDaenerys saw gang raped atop a pile of corpses, the girl who&rsquo;s wails turned Dany\naround. </p><p>After everything goes so\nhorribly wrong, when Drogo&rsquo;s men turn against her and Jorah brings her into the\ntent with Mirri and she loses Rhaego and Drogo and wakes up with nothing, Mirri\ntells her this:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I spoke for you,&rdquo; she\nsaid, anguished. &ldquo;I saved you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Saved</i> me?&rdquo; The Lhazareen woman spat. &ldquo;Three riders had taken me,\nnot as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth\nwas in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god&rsquo;s house\nburn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well,\nand in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my\nbread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons\npast. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips.\nTell me again what you saved.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your life.&rdquo; </p><p>Mirri Maz Duur laughed\ncruelly. &ldquo;Look to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is\ngone.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Mirri obviously makes\nsome morally dubious decisions, but there is a lot of truth in what she tells\nDaenerys. What Dany viewed as saving, Mirri sees as a pitiful gesture; the damage\nwas already done before Dany changed her mind, and she didn&rsquo;t see or understand\nthat. If Daenerys was in a more understanding mindset, Mirri has a great lesson\nto teach her about how you treat people, especially your slaves (because yes,\nMirri is Dany&rsquo;s slave). </p><p>That&rsquo;s not the lesson\nDany learns though, she learns <i>If I look\nback I am lost</i>; which is a callback to a passage from her earlier chapters:</p><blockquote><p>Behind them the great\nhorde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking\ndust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant</p></blockquote><p>Deciding not to look back\nis a decision Dany makes so she doesn&rsquo;t have to face the reality of her choices\nand mistakes. Everything is okay if she doesn&rsquo;t turn back, if she doesn&rsquo;t see\nthe way her actions sow a crop of blood in the soil. But like I said, Dany&rsquo;s\nbest moments come when she looks behind her. If she didn&rsquo;t look back for Eroeh,\nshe would have left women to be raped and sold into slavery. Especially when we\nget to <i>A Storm of Swords</i> and<i> A Dance with Dragons</i>, it&rsquo;s just so clear that\nlooking back is essential to Dany&rsquo;s morality. She tries not to through those\nbooks, but she can&rsquo;t stop herself. Yet every time she does, she hates it. She\nhates that she saved Mirri Maz Duur and cost herself so much in the process. That&rsquo;s\nwhy she tells herself <i>If I look back I am\nlost</i>, to remember to never look back again. </p><p><b>Waking the Dragon</b></p><p>This is the climax of\nDany&rsquo;s arc in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>; everything in her chapters is leading her to\nthe moment she steps into Drogo&rsquo;s funeral pyre. From her first chapter, she\ndreams of her dragons:</p><blockquote><p><i>There\nare no more dragons</i>, Dany thought, staring at her brother,\nthough she did not dare say it aloud.</p><p>Yet that night she dreamt\nof one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear.\nShe ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again.\nShe stumbled and fell. &ldquo;You woke the dragon,&rdquo; he screamed as he kicked her. &ldquo;You\nwoke the dragon, you woke the dragon.&rdquo; Her thighs were slick with blood. She\nclosed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping\nsound and the <i>crackling</i> of some great\nfire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all\naround, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head\nslowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a\nfine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid&hellip;</p></blockquote><p>Her next dream has a much\nmore positive feel, but carries the same language:</p><blockquote><p>She opened her arms to\nthe fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper\nher and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough\naway, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam</p></blockquote><p>This dream really reminds\nme of GRRM&rsquo;s inspiration for his title, <i>Fire and Ice</i> by Robert Frost:</p><blockquote><p>Some say the world will\nend in fire/Some say in ice/From what I&rsquo;ve tasted of desire/I hold with those\nwho favor fire</p></blockquote><p>When Dany is in Mirri&rsquo;s\ntent, her dreams start to take on a very ominous tone:</p><blockquote><p>A great knife of pain\nripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of\nburning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. The\ndoor loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur\naround her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew\nacross the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all\nthat lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>She woke to the taste of\nashes.</p></blockquote><p>The progression of her\ndreams tell an interesting story. At first, when Daenerys wants no part of\nViserys&rsquo; dreams or the Seven Kingdoms, the dragon in her dream terrifies her\nand she wakes more scared than she&rsquo;s ever been. But when the dream comes to her\non the Dothraki sea, after she&rsquo;s received her eggs as a wedding gift, she\nembraces the dragon in her dream; lets the fire mold and shape her, burn away\nher fear and hurt. And when she&rsquo;s fever dreaming in Mirri&rsquo;s tent, she takes the\nnext step and becomes the dragon; flying over Westeros, chasing the red door. As\nDany progresses through <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, she slowly embraces the dragon until\nshe is ready to hatch them in her final chapter.</p><p>What&rsquo;s most interesting\nis the framing of what that means. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a coincidence that we are\nintroduced to the concept of &ldquo;<i>waking the dragon</i>&rdquo; through Viserys&rsquo; threats to\nDaenerys. From the first chapter, we&rsquo;re meant to understand that waking the\ndragon is really bad for Daenerys. She tries her hardest <i>not</i> to wake the dragon, because something very bad will happen to\nher if she does. And her first dream of the dragon from her second chapter\nfeeds into this narrative; the dragon seeks to burn her.</p><p>In her second dream, she\nis much more comfortable standing before the dragon; but it&rsquo;s important to realize\nthat nothing has changed in the structure of the dream. Her dragon still wants\nto burn her, but now she finds strength in that; let this dragon burn away her\nweakness and temper her strength. She&rsquo;s starting to grow closer to her eggs,\nand also more comfortable with her heritage. Being with the Dothraki stripped her\nof everything except herself, and she&rsquo;s starting to fall back on that for strength.</p><p>A lot of time passes before\nshe has her last and final dream before hatching her dragons, and the tone has\nnow changed. She isn&rsquo;t standing before the dragon; she is the dragon. In her\ndream, she hears Viserys saying &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to wake the dragon, do you?&rdquo;\nand as she dreams it slowly falls away until all she hears is &ldquo;wake the dragon&rdquo;.\nThrough her travels on the Dothraki Sea, she&rsquo;s gone from a scared girl cowering\nbefore the dragon, to the one flying overhead, making every living thing\ntremble in fear.</p><p>She has gone from Dany to\nDaenerys Targaryen. </p><p>And this isn&rsquo;t supposed to\nbe a good thing. Like I said, it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that we&rsquo;re introduced to &ldquo;<i>waking\nthe dragon</i>&rdquo; as something Dany should fear. The imagery of her dreams is very\nclear; Dany is burned away, and in the ashes rises Daenerys Targaryen, Queen\nand Conqueror. </p><p>The most ominous and\nforeboding part of how Daenerys wakes the dragons, is of course the sacrifice\nshe makes to hatch them. It&rsquo;s pretty clear in the text, but confirmed by GRRM\nin interviews, that Daenerys is able to walk into the fire unscathed and hatch\nher dragons because of blood magic. She has already lost Drogo and Rhaego\npermanently at this point, so I don&rsquo;t take issue with using their deaths towards\nsaving herself, but the sacrifice of Mirri is entirely different. I want to\nestablish that Daenerys knows what she is doing when she chooses to burn Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I remember what you told\nme. Only death can pay for life.&rdquo; </p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve seen many people who\nargue that Daenerys would eventually turn dark use this quote as one of the\nfirst signs:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You will not hear me scream,&rdquo;\nMirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Dany said</p></blockquote><p>But to me, the end of\nthat sentence is much more frightening:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;but it is not your\nscreams I want, only your life.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Daenerys understands that\nMirri&rsquo;s death is paying for her dragons, and that&rsquo;s <i>why</i> she does it. I would\nunderstand, I would be <i>less</i> worried for\nDany, if her killing Mirri was a rash decision made out of grief, exhaustion,\npure rage; but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a cold, rational, <i>calm</i> decision; she thinks about it, understands it, <i>and then</i> burns Mirri alive. </p><p>Remember when I said\nMirri had a valuable lesson to teach Daenerys, and Daenerys learned all the\nwrong things? This is what she learned, that only death can pay for life. Instead\nof hearing Mirri&rsquo;s critique on what Dany was complicit in, Daenerys takes it to\nheart that death should not be meaningless; not in the way that life is\nprecious and therefore should be preserved, but in the way that she should get\nsomething out of it &ndash; in this case dragons. </p><p>I also want to call\nattention to what Mirri is to Daenerys. A lot of Daenerys&rsquo; more adamant\ndefenders will call back to the same argument every time: Daenerys kills\nslavers. Killing bad men, even if in brutal fashion, cannot just suddenly\nchange into killing the innocent and oppressed. But remember, Mirri is where it\nall started; yes Daenerys was in some way involved in the brutality that befell\nthe Lhazareen people, but it is clear she didn&rsquo;t have a full understanding of\nwhat she was asking when she said she wanted to take the Iron Throne, and turned\nback on her decision to try and help the girls. Burning Mirri Maz Duur is the\nfirst death that is the direct result of Daenerys&rsquo; choice (Viserys&rsquo; death was\nthe result of <i>his </i>choices). And who\nwas Mirri to Daenerys? </p><p><b><i>Her slave.</i></b></p><p>This decision also\nhighlights a certain capacity for cruelty. I previously mentioned that Daenerys\nslaps Eroeh, the girl she saw gang raped only days prior, and again she shows\nsomething similar with Mirri:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am tired of the maegi&rsquo;s\nbraying,&rdquo; Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife\nkept silent.</p></blockquote><p>I understand that Mirri\nhas taken Rhaego from Daenerys, but it shows a certain tunnel vision Daenerys has\nthat she cannot understanding that much more was taken from Mirri before the\nmaegi resorted in blood magic. </p><p>This kind of tunnel\nvision Daenerys is something she has through all the books, Daznak&rsquo;s Pit being\nthe clearest example, and <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is no different. The simultaneous\nhorror and beauty of Daenerys&rsquo; blaze is breathtaking. Something horrific is\ntaking place; the horse murdered for Drogo is burning, Mirri Maz Duur is\nscreaming, Jorah and the Dothraki are shouting and crying. Yet the language is\nbeautiful:</p><blockquote><p>Huge orange gouts of fire\nunfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking,\nglowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn\nfireflies</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames writhed before\nher like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and\nspinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The flames were so beautiful,\nthe loveliest things she had ever seen, each on a sorcerer robed in yellow and\norange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and\ngreat yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame</p></blockquote><p>You can almost forget the\nhorror of Mirri burning, because the flames are just so beautiful to Daenerys.\nThe flames are described like dancers, floating and swirling and captivating\nher; everything else doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore, only the flames. Yet GRRM doesn&rsquo;t\nlet us fully forget:</p><blockquote><p>The pyre roared in the\ndeepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri\nMaz Duur&rsquo;s screaming</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She heard the screams of\nfrightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and\nterror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. <i>No</i>, she wanted to shout to\nhim, <i>no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys\nStormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don&rsquo;t you\nsee? Don&rsquo;t you SEE?</i></p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m not trying to say\nthat Daenerys is a bad person now. She still has so many redeeming qualities;\nshe still cares deeply for people, fights against slavery, wants to help her\npeople. In lesser fiction, character arcs on a graph are a straight line headed\nup or down, but GRRM is writing a masterpiece. He has no interest in clean arcs\nbecause real people are not one note; if you plotted a real person&rsquo;s choices\nout on a graph, it would be a series of small ups and downs while still\ntrending one direction, there could even be massive rises or falls because real\npeople slip and regress as they fall into old habits. Daenerys is on a path\nleading to a dark turn, but she still has many highs left to go. The speech she\ngives to the Dothraki before she lights Drogo&rsquo;s pyre is evidence of this; she\nlooks out and sees her people, those rejected by the <i>khalasar</i> that left her.\nThe old, the children, the women, the sick or crippled; and she embraces them.\nDaenerys is fiercely loyal to this group of people who still stood by her after\neveryone else left her. And she sets them free; Daenerys&rsquo; new<i> khalasar</i> will not\nbe built on the backs of slaves.</p><p>But the dragons call to\nher, and she can&rsquo;t say no to them. <i>She is the blood of the dragon, and the fire\nis in her.</i> Daenerys wants many things, like peace and home and trees, but all of\nthose things fall away when she sees the glory and bane of her house. When she\nstands in the pyre, everything else falls away; the roaring and cracking of the\nfire and her dragons hatching drowns out the screams and shrieks and cries. The\nfire dances in her eyes and pulls her forward. Her dragons are beautiful and\nterrible, awe inspiring and fear inducing. They will always be both, just as Daenerys\nherself has always had both callings inside her, and it is very fitting that\nher <i>A Game of Thrones</i> arc should end here</p><p><i>For the first time in\nhundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.</i></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Due to&hellip;recent events&hellip;I think it&rsquo;s important to\ngo back through George RR Martin&rsquo;s books and really understand what he was trying\nto say with Daenerys Targaryen. She occupies the same space in the narrative\nthat Jon Snow does, where she&rsquo;s just stereotypical enough, just fantasy trope\nenough, that people take for granted who her character is and what she\nrepresents. But, like Jon, if you read her chapters with an open mind, you&rsquo;ll\nnotice all of these great subversions and character traits that you miss the\nfirst time.</p>\n<p>Breaking down the journey she takes in <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, GRRM lays a lot of\ntracks for where the story will take her&hellip; </p>\n<p><b>The Outsider</b></p>\n<p>The first thing about Daenerys is that she is\ninstantly an outsider. GRRM loves writing outsiders, and a huge amount of the\nPOV&rsquo;s in book one are introduced as an outsider in some way; Jon being a\nbastard in a society driven by status, Arya as a tomboy in a patriarchal\nsociety, Sansa as someone who doesn&rsquo;t fit with her family, Tyrion as a dwarf in\nan ableist society, and so on. Daenerys takes this concept to its extreme; not\nonly is she an outsider within her own world, she is an outsider within the\nnarrative. All the POVs we&rsquo;ll have in this book were the victors of Robert&rsquo;s\nRebellion. They may have lost things (like Ned losing Lyanna) but Robert&rsquo;s\nRebellion worked for them in a way that they either ended up better off than\nbefore, or received some form of justice for the wrongs they&rsquo;d suffered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But\nDaenerys <i>lost</i>. She was supposed to be\na Princess, to grow up in the Red Keep with an entire kingdom at her feet. Instead, we are introduced to a young girl who hasn&rsquo;t truly known a home her\nwhole life, a girl who thinks she was chased around a continent by assassins\nout to take her life. We know, because we&rsquo;ve lived inside Eddard Stark&rsquo;s head,\nthat Daenerys&rsquo; family was unequivocally on the wrong side of Robert&rsquo;s\nRebellion, but suddenly we understand that even in a just war, innocent people\nwill get ruined.</p>\n<p>So, with Daenerys being the lone Targaryen POV we\nhave, it creates a sort of dissonance where she is portrayed as sympathetic,\nyet is the natural enemy to the Starks who are our heroes. When her brother\nViserys tells her these awful stories of &ldquo;<i>the Usurper and his dogs</i>&rdquo;, we know\nshe&rsquo;s being lied to because we know Eddard Stark, but yet we have to sympathize\nwith this child who was supposed to have everything and, instead, was left with\nnothing. Like Tyrion, we as a reader don&rsquo;t quite know how to feel about her,\nbecause she is the antagonist of our heroes, but when you see things from her\nperspective suddenly this black and white war turns into a hundred different\nshades of grey. </p>\n</p>",
