I took a seat and just breathed in the fresh salty air, before ordering a freshly squeezed glass of orange juice.</p><p>When the waitress left to fetch me my beverage, I lazily (and uselessly) browsed the menu, only confirming what my mind was on. Blueberry pancakes with sour cream and nuts.</p><p>I smiled up at the waitress when she set the tall glass filled with juice, accompanied with a bright green straw and a floaty orange slice.</p><p>She took my order and moved to another table. I followed her with my eyes momentarily, liking the colour of her hair, before I heard the slow drawl of a voice ordering a muffin. When I moved my eyes to glance at the person, I was half surprised to see Harry, with a laid back posture, sunglasses covering his eyes and a casual fedora on his head, leaving some curls poking from under its edge.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t smiling, but his aura just gave away how kind he really was, to the point where nobody even questioned his lack of a smile.</p><p>I was slightly transfixed on his persona to the point where I almost didn&rsquo;t notice his head turning in my direction. I couldn&rsquo;t tell, at the beginning, if he was actually looking my way, because of the shades resting on the bridge of his nose, but when the corner of his lips uplifted a bit and he gave the slightest nod of his head, I knew he was greeting me.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling awkward or shy, I was just extremely flattered that he remembered me from the Imagine Dragons event a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>I smiled and gave a weak wave of the fingers, then turned the plate that had just been placed in front of me at that moment, and I noticed the plate on the waitress&rsquo; other hand, with a muffin on it.</p><p>She offered me a cordial smile and proceeded to moved to his table, settng his order in front of him and heading back inside the caf\u00e9.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t look back at him, deciding to play it cool and just take my relaxed time to slowly go through my glorious pancakes. It is uncanny ow the right recipe can make the sun brighter and the sky bluer.</p><p>Still, I couldn&rsquo;t help but let my eyes glance at him from time to time, seeing him either thoroughly going through his muffin or chatting quietly with, who I suppose is, his friend.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>I was still sat at the table after finishing my breakfast, now with a refreshing iced green tea in front of me and flipping through a magazine.</p><p>I was engrossed in an article about the last trends on accessories when I saw him from the corner of my eyes. He stood up at the same time his friend did, gave a firm shake of the hand and a friendly hug with lots of promises of catching up soon, then the bald-headed guy made his way into the caf\u00e9 and to the exit.</p><p>I slowly bit my lip and turned my gaze back on Harry, who was now sitting back at the table and raising his cup to finish his drink. His shades were folded and now hanging on the opening of his half buttoned shirt. I honestly wondered why he even bothered putting it on - I cant say I knw many people who would complain if he just decided to disregard the garment alltogether.</p><p>I barely lifted my eyes to his face when I saw his turning in my direction, making me self conscious about how I was staring at him.</p><p>His body was angled away from me, his elbow on the table, supporting his hand that&rsquo;s holding the cup, still at his lips. His eyes, though, they were on me.</p><p>As nonchalantly as possible, I gave a weak smile and focused back on my magazine, shaking my head at myself at my stupidity. I was eyeing him like a prey, in the middle of the day, in open sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Shaya, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Granted, our tables weren&rsquo;t too far from each other, but he still managed to use a level of voice high enough for me to hear, still not too loud so that everyone would&rsquo;ve been able to notice.</p><p>I paused for a slight second, then lifted my head and locked eyes with him. He had a gentle expression on his face and raised eyebrows, reminding me of his question.</p><p>&ldquo;The one and only. Hi Harry.&rdquo; My tone light, trying to keep the calm atmosphere.</p><p>He chuckled, looked at his hands, shook his head and looked back at me, a smile still on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I offer you another drink?&rdquo; His offer hung in the air for a couple seconds before I smiled and nodded, waving him over.</p><p>His lanky figure raised from the seat, trying to be smooth, but little did he know I notice the slight stumble when he caught his foot on the leg of his chair. I pulled my lips between my teeth, supressing a giggle as I watched him collect his things from the table and make his way over.</p><p>I gently closed the magazine and put it aside as he slid in the seat to my left and got comfortable, leaning his forearms on the edge of the table. \u00a0We smiled at each other and he waved the waitress over.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know why, but the awkwardness shifted and a sense of excitement took over.</p>",

He had a gentle expression on his face and raised eyebrows, reminding me of his question.</p><p>\u201cThe one and only.

I pulled my lips between my teeth, supressing a giggle as I watched him collect his things from the table and make his way over.</p><p>I gently closed the magazine and put it aside as he slid in the seat to my left and got comfortable, leaning his forearms on the edge of the table. \u00a0We smiled at each other and he waved the waitress over.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know why, but the awkwardness shifted and a sense of excitement took over.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Finally having some time off in Los Angeles put me in such a good mood that I didn&rsquo;t even want to make plans.</p><p>I woke up at a reasonable time in the morning, took a long, relaxing shower, air dried, put light clothes on, light make up and got out.</p><p>When I hailed the taxi I didn&rsquo;t even stutter when reciting an address to the driver - it has been on my mind since I opened my eyes that morning.</p><p>It was a well known, but quite laid back place nonetheless, on the west side of the &lsquo;city of angels&rsquo; and they had the best pancakes of the coast.</p><p>I asked for a small porch table, under a giant umbrella that shielded me from the scorching beam of the sun. I took a seat and just breathed in the fresh salty air, before ordering a freshly squeezed glass of orange juice.</p><p>When the waitress left to fetch me my beverage, I lazily (and uselessly) browsed the menu, only confirming what my mind was on. Blueberry pancakes with sour cream and nuts.</p><p>I smiled up at the waitress when she set the tall glass filled with juice, accompanied with a bright green straw and a floaty orange slice.</p><p>She took my order and moved to another table. I followed her with my eyes momentarily, liking the colour of her hair, before I heard the slow drawl of a voice ordering a muffin.

Brushing my brows the last time, I put on a bit concealer and some blush to make my skin look a lil bit more awake. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t leave without my brows Ni. Especially with paps chasing you everywhere, I don&rsquo;t think anybody will fancy a pic of browless ghoul me beside you.&rdquo; I said looking at him. Niall and I are going to Paris for his match and me, just being there supporting him and tagging along just because I will take all the time I can have with him. Besides, Niall playing golf? Wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for the world.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to wear that darling. Just look at me in my shoes.&rdquo; He said after hearing me cuss at the small stain on my pale pink pumps. &ldquo;It seems quite uncomfortable love.&rdquo; I look at him wincing at my feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that high of a heel and it&rsquo;s a block heel. So I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo; I told him. Grabbing my bag, I walked out of the room and heading downstairs after him. </p><p>&ldquo;Aye me girl dressing so good while I look like this.&rdquo; Niall joke as he motions to his body. He is currently in his black hoodie and shorts along with the white nike sneakers and a cap. &ldquo;Oh please. You know you look good without even trying.&rdquo; I scoffed and smile at him. &ldquo;Just sayin&rsquo; babe. It&rsquo;s gone be a long flight ye know.&rdquo; I sighed sipping on the tea at the counter. &ldquo;I know. I just, like to look good okay? Especially when you are constantly being surrounded by paps and people taking picstures of you. Not to mention when you have a boyfriend that look so damn good especially in hoodie that is just cuddly and snuggly.&rdquo; I said taking another sip on my tea. It&rsquo;s hot.</p><p>Niall laughs and look at me. &ldquo;Dressing good fo just paps?&rdquo; He cocked his brow. &ldquo;Well, that and for someone obviously!&rdquo; I said while playfully acting serious. &ldquo;C'mon. We have to catch our flight.&rdquo; </p><p>.</p><p>The flight took about 11 hours. Which was not good for my sanity, nor body, nor my skin. &ldquo;Niiii. Oh my god. I didn&rsquo;t realise that it&rsquo;s gonna be so long! My skiiinnn. Noooo.&rdquo; I said looking at him and touching my face pouting. &ldquo;Dramatic.&rdquo; He just said smirking. &ldquo;Hmmph. Fine. I won&rsquo;t bother your time anymore mister.&rdquo; I said facing away being mad fakingly. The tiredness from being in the plane for hours was making me more dramatic every second that passes. I can hear him chuckling from beside me. </p><p>&ldquo;Aww baby. Such a spoiled girl.&rdquo; He said gently facing my face to him again. &ldquo;I know right? But I&rsquo;m your spoiled girl.&rdquo; I said smiling widely like I wasn&rsquo;t just a dramatic bitch 5 seconds ago. My spoiled attitude is showung more and more. </p><p>&ldquo;Eh no.&rdquo; He said laughing at me. I frown and hit his upper arm. &ldquo;Jerk.&rdquo; I said and pouted again. I can tell he was getting amused more and more just from his damn smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay okay babe. Yer my spoiled little girl alright?&rdquo; Niall said again still laughing lightly causing me to also laugh because who can stay mad while hearing his laugh? I was'nt even angry I was just bored and tired. &ldquo;Hmm. Okay.&rdquo; I said trying to resist the smile that is forming on my face. &ldquo;Aye still tryna be mad at me eh?&rdquo; I just shrug and cuddle further to his neck smiling. &ldquo;Get some sleep love.&rdquo; He said and I can feel him dropping a kiss on my head. I just nods and close my eyes hugging his arm and heading to sleep.</p><p>A/N well that&rsquo;s it. And it is weird. But anyways send in request! </p>",

You know you look good without even trying.&rdquo; I scoffed and smile at him. &ldquo;Just sayin&rsquo; babe. It&rsquo;s gone be a long flight ye know.&rdquo; I sighed sipping on the tea at the counter. &ldquo;I know. I just, like to look good okay? Especially when you are constantly being surrounded by paps and people taking picstures of you. Not to mention when you have a boyfriend that look so damn good especially in hoodie that is just cuddly and snuggly.&rdquo; I said taking another sip on my tea. It&rsquo;s hot.</p><p>Niall laughs and look at me. &ldquo;Dressing good fo just paps?&rdquo; He cocked his brow. &ldquo;Well, that and for someone obviously!&rdquo; I said while playfully acting serious. &ldquo;C'mon. We have to catch our flight.&rdquo; </p><p>.</p><p>The flight took about 11 hours. Which was not good for my sanity, nor body, nor my skin. &ldquo;Niiii. Oh my god. I didn&rsquo;t realise that it&rsquo;s gonna be so long! My skiiinnn. Noooo.&rdquo; I said looking at him and touching my face pouting. &ldquo;Dramatic.&rdquo; He just said smirking. &ldquo;Hmmph. Fine. I won&rsquo;t bother your time anymore mister.&rdquo; I said facing away being mad fakingly. The tiredness from being in the plane for hours was making me more dramatic every second that passes. I can hear him chuckling from beside me. </p><p>&ldquo;Aww baby. Such a spoiled girl.&rdquo; He said gently facing my face to him again. &ldquo;I know right? But I&rsquo;m your spoiled girl.&rdquo; I said smiling widely like I wasn&rsquo;t just a dramatic bitch 5 seconds ago. My spoiled attitude is showung more and more. </p><p>&ldquo;Eh no.&rdquo; He said laughing at me. I frown and hit his upper arm. &ldquo;Jerk.&rdquo; I said and pouted again. I can tell he was getting amused more and more just from his damn smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay okay babe. Yer my spoiled little girl alright?&rdquo; Niall said again still laughing lightly causing me to also laugh because who can stay mad while hearing his laugh? I was'nt even angry I was just bored and tired. &ldquo;Hmm. Okay.&rdquo; I said trying to resist the smile that is forming on my face. &ldquo;Aye still tryna be mad at me eh?&rdquo; I just shrug and cuddle further to his neck smiling. &ldquo;Get some sleep love.&rdquo; He said and I can feel him dropping a kiss on my head. I just nods and close my eyes hugging his arm and heading to sleep.</p><p>A/N well that&rsquo;s it. And it is weird. But anyways send in request! </p></p>",

Mitchel Rowland, a friend you made through Harry. You invited him and his girlfriend, Sarah, as you had gotten to know them really well during Harry&rsquo;s first solo tour, as they were both apart of the band. &ldquo;Mitch?&rdquo; you asked confused. You go in for a hug, as it had been a while since you last saw him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow, you look <g class=\"gr_ gr_234 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"234\" data-gr-id=\"234\">amazing</g>\u201d he says looking at you up and down.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mitch. Why are you here? The ceremony is starting soon, you better get back to your seat,&rdquo; you say.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N he is here&rdquo; Mitch didn&rsquo;t need to name him, you knew who he was talking about.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why? He wasn&rsquo;t invited?&rdquo; you question him. &ldquo;I know, I told him he shouldn&rsquo;t be here, but he just showed up out of the blue. I told him to go home.&rdquo; Mitch says with a smidge of annoyance in his voice.</p><p>The door behind you opens, and the same cologne you smelt before instantly fills your nose. You knew it isn&rsquo;t the dress fitter as you look at Mitch&rsquo;s face, his expression is a mix of confusion and anger. You then turn around to see him standing there. He is wearing a black suit, dressed for the wedding. But he wasn&rsquo;t a guest.</p><p>His eyes lock on you, he gazes over your entire body, his eyes soften and his mouth gapes slightly. &ldquo;You-you look beautiful&rdquo; he stuttered out walking closer to you.\u00a0</p><p>Mitch just looks at the two of you &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go back to my seat&rdquo; he says walking out the door. &ldquo;Mitch? Can you tell Grace I might be a while&rdquo; he just nods, then shuts the door behind <g class=\"gr_ gr_240 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace\" id=\"240\" data-gr-id=\"240\">him.</g></p><p>&ldquo;Harry, what are you doing here? Michale won&rsquo;t be happy if he sees you&rdquo; you look into his eyes, they are so familiar. More memories come flooding back of all the goodness you shared with him.</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you were getting married?&rdquo; he says quietly, his voice is shaky, he isn&rsquo;t angry, just hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Harry!&rdquo; you raise your voice, he flinches at your change in tone.</p><p>&ldquo;We haven\u2019t spoken in years, and the album, god, I didn&rsquo;t know what to say?&rdquo; you sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;You could have called,&rdquo; he says slowly, looking up at you. &ldquo;You could have called too!&rdquo; you yell.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I know, but, I don&rsquo;t know! I thought you would come back, like all the other times. But you never did, you moved on, found someone else, and now your getting married&rdquo; he says throwing his hands up gesturing to your dress and everything around you. &ldquo;I was stupid, I was so caught up in everything, I didn&rsquo;t <g class=\"gr_ gr_255 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"255\" data-gr-id=\"255\">realise</g> that I wasn&rsquo;t enough for you. I&rsquo;ve been beating myself up every day for never doing anything&rdquo; he says looking to the ground, the light caught on his glassy eyes, when he blinked a tear came out.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin your happiness, Mitch told me you were happy with Michael&rdquo; he wipes the tear away.</p><p>&ldquo;I am happy with Michale,&rdquo; you say sternly. It felt weird to say, especially to Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I know! That&rsquo;s why I could never do this! You are finally happy after so long.\u201d he exclaimed throwing his hands up in the air. \u201cI saw the invitation <g class=\"gr_ gr_248 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"248\" data-gr-id=\"248\">on</g> Mitch&rsquo;s fridge, and I had to get away. While I was gone, all I did was think about you.\u00a0I knew this would be my last chance&rdquo; he pauses.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N when you left me, I so was caught up in the fame and the money, everything was crazy. And you were always there through everything. When you were gone I <g class=\"gr_ gr_251 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"251\" data-gr-id=\"251\">realised</g> I had nothing without you. You were my happiness, you complete me&rdquo; Your expression is blank. You didn\u2019t know how to feel. Tears started welling up in your eyes, you tried to blink them back, but that only made them spill out.</p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve tried, Y/N trust me I&rsquo;ve tried to move on, but I can&rsquo;t, your it for me. I love you. I never stopped, and whether you marry Michale today, I will still love you, for the rest of my life&rdquo; There were tears running down both of your faces.\u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t <g class=\"gr_ gr_256 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"256\" data-gr-id=\"256\">cry</g>&ldquo; he says &quot;Your gonna mess up your pretty <g class=\"gr_ gr_257 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"257\" data-gr-id=\"257\">face</g>&rdquo; he said wiping a tear away on your cheek. You push his hand <g class=\"gr_ gr_598 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"598\" data-gr-id=\"598\">off</g> you and step back.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just come to me and say all of this! And on my wedding day? Of all the days, you chose today? Harry, you have always had bad timing, but this, this is just the worst.\u201d You&rsquo;re angry but relieved at the same time. If he wasn&rsquo;t here right now, you would be standing at the alter about to commit to something you weren&rsquo;t 100% sure about.</p><p>\u201cYou always ruin everything good for me! God, when Michael asked me to be his girlfriend, your album came out the same fucking day!&rdquo; you&rsquo;re still yelling, even though you relived you still needed to vent your feelings.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything I do, it&rsquo;s like your ghost is there haunting me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were so good Y/N, we were so in love&rdquo; Harry pleads, taking your hands into his. His hands were warm, how they always were. Your hands fit perfectly in his.</p><p>&ldquo;It was good, I loved you&rdquo; you emphasized the loved, and pull away from his grip. &ldquo;Harry your too late, I love Michale, and he makes me <g class=\"gr_ gr_236 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"236\" data-gr-id=\"236\">happy</g>&rdquo; you say, mostly to convince yourself.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed, losing you made me <g class=\"gr_ gr_227 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"227\" data-gr-id=\"227\">reali</g>-&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;You should go,&rdquo; you say interrupting him. You couldn\u2019t let him stop your wedding.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N please,&rdquo; he says with so much emotion in his voice, while wiping the tears from his eyes. You sit back down and start trying to fix to fix the mess you had made of your makeup. You get lost in thought as you dab at you undereye. Harry then sets a box down on the vanity in front of you. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; you ask him.</p><p>He opens it, and inside is a ring. The most beautiful ring you had ever seen. Three sparkling diamonds, with two rubies on each side. It was the exact ring you wanted. You remember back to the drunk conversation you had so many years ago when you told him about your dream ring. &ldquo;I got it the month before you broke up with me. I was going to propose to you Y/N&rdquo; You look up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; you say slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, perfect even, how, how did you remember?&rdquo; you say quickly while picking up the box to get a closer look.</p><p>&ldquo;I always <g class=\"gr_ gr_229 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"229\" data-gr-id=\"229\">remember</g>&rdquo; he says.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?!&rdquo; You ask him angrily. &ldquo;If you loved me so much you were going to propose, why didn&rsquo;t you fucking tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was stupid Y/N, you broke my heart, and I didn&rsquo;t think you would want me back.&rdquo; The sadness in his eyes made you feel so much guilt.

The hug lasted for a long time. You could feel him crying as he buries his head into your hair, inhaling your scent for what would be the last time. The hug was a goodbye, and you both knew that.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Good <g class=\"gr_ gr_242 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"242\" data-gr-id=\"242\">luck</g>&rdquo; he says, pulling away.

You didn\u2019t know what to feel. Everything Harry said was everything you wanted to hear but at the wrong time.\u00a0</p><p>You meet up with Grace, and she gives you a look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, let&rsquo;s do this,&rdquo; you say, trying to convince your self that this is the right decision. The music starts playing and you walk down the aisle, all your friends and family rise and look at you in awe. You&rsquo;re clutching your bouquet so tight, your hands are white. This was it, too late to turn back now.</p><p>When Michale turns around to look at you, he wipes a tear from his eye. He looks so handsome. As you grab his hand joining him facing the priest, he whispers to you &ldquo;You look amazing&rdquo; while he squeezes your a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;So do <g class=\"gr_ gr_260 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"260\" data-gr-id=\"260\">you</g>&rdquo; you say smiling. As the priest goes on, the feeling of uncertainty rises in your chest.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo; Michale whispers in your ear. You look at him with confusion on your face. What does he mean? Of course, you want to do this, don&rsquo;t you?\u00a0&quot;You have to do what makes you happy&quot; he continues, &ldquo;I just want you to be happy&rdquo; Did he see Harry? Did Harry talk to him? Your head is now spinning, why did this have to happen today, of all days, on your wedding day. You look at Michael, then look to the door you entered through. Were you really about to do this?</p><p>Tears are streaming down your face, you look at Michael and kiss him on the cheek, and whisper in his ear &ldquo;I am so sorry.\u201d Picking up your skirt you\u00a0run back down the aisle. Guests are giving you horrified looks as gasps and chatter fill the church. Michale&rsquo;s mother suddenly stands up, then your own mother and they just watch you run. No one stops you though. Everything is a blur, you see Mitch in the crowd of people, he sitting down, and he gives you a weak smile.</p><p>When you get out of the church into the parking lot, holding up as much of your expensive white dress as you can, you look for the black range rover you knew he would be in. You spot it and surely make your way over, it starts moving, he\u2019s leaving. He obviously hasn&rsquo;t seen you. As he turns out of the parking lot, and onto the street, you kick off your shoes and start running.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Harry! Stop!&rdquo; you yell after the car. You then stop in the middle of the street as its no use. Just as you stop so does the car. He gets out, his face is red from crying. He runs to you, and you run to him. As you meet you jump into to him, wrapping your legs around his waist, just like you would do in the airport when he got back from a tour.</p><p>His lips immediately crash into yours. You kiss him like your life depended on it. It felt so good, it had been so many years since your lips were on his. &ldquo;I fucking hate <g class=\"gr_ gr_247 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"247\" data-gr-id=\"247\">you</g>&rdquo; you say to him breathlessly between kisses.

You continue kissing, without a care in the world. Even though you just abandoned your own wedding, you didn&rsquo;t care because kissing Harry at this moment felt so right.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise I will be everything you want, I love you Y/N&rdquo; he carries you to the passenger seat of his car, and you get in stuffing you dress so it doesn&rsquo;t get caught in the door. He gets in and drives. He stops at a nearby park. You look at him &ldquo;What about the wedding?&rdquo; he asks you.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you say sighing. &ldquo;I just knew if I said \u2018I do\u2019, I would regret <g class=\"gr_ gr_2191 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"2191\" data-gr-id=\"2191\">it</g>&rdquo; you say turning to him, taking his hands into yours.</p><p>&ldquo;You will always be a part of my life, I will always love you and I can&rsquo;t just pretend I don&rsquo;t.

Mitchel Rowland, a friend you made through Harry. You invited him and his girlfriend, Sarah, as you had gotten to know them really well during Harry\u2019s first solo tour, as they were both apart of the band. \u201cMitch?\u201d you asked confused. You go in for a hug, as it had been a while since you last saw him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow, you look <g class=\"gr_ gr_234 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"234\" data-gr-id=\"234\">amazing</g>\u201d he says looking at you up and down.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mitch. Why are you here? The ceremony is starting soon, you better get back to your seat,\u201d you say.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N he is here\u201d Mitch didn\u2019t need to name him, you knew who he was talking about.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? He wasn\u2019t invited?\u201d you question him. \u201cI know, I told him he shouldn\u2019t be here, but he just showed up out of the blue. I told him to go home.\u201d Mitch says with a smidge of annoyance in his voice.</p><p>The door behind you opens, and the same cologne you smelt before instantly fills your nose. You knew it isn\u2019t the dress fitter as you look at Mitch\u2019s face, his expression is a mix of confusion and anger. You then turn around to see him standing there. He is wearing a black suit, dressed for the wedding. But he wasn\u2019t a guest.</p><p>His eyes lock on you, he gazes over your entire body, his eyes soften and his mouth gapes slightly. \u201cYou-you look beautiful\u201d he stuttered out walking closer to you.\u00a0</p><p>Mitch just looks at the two of you \u201cI\u2019m gonna go back to my seat\u201d he says walking out the door. \u201cMitch? Can you tell Grace I might be a while\u201d he just nods, then shuts the door behind <g class=\"gr_ gr_240 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace\" id=\"240\" data-gr-id=\"240\">him.</g></p><p>\u201cHarry, what are you doing here? Michale won\u2019t be happy if he sees you\u201d you look into his eyes, they are so familiar. More memories come flooding back of all the goodness you shared with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were getting married?\u201d he says quietly, his voice is shaky, he isn\u2019t angry, just hurt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry!\u201d you raise your voice, he flinches at your change in tone.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken in years, and the album, god, I didn\u2019t know what to say?\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou could have called,\u201d he says slowly, looking up at you. \u201cYou could have called too!\u201d you yell.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, but, I don\u2019t know! I thought you would come back, like all the other times. But you never did, you moved on, found someone else, and now your getting married\u201d he says throwing his hands up gesturing to your dress and everything around you. \u201cI was stupid, I was so caught up in everything, I didn\u2019t <g class=\"gr_ gr_255 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"255\" data-gr-id=\"255\">realise</g> that I wasn\u2019t enough for you. I\u2019ve been beating myself up every day for never doing anything\u201d he says looking to the ground, the light caught on his glassy eyes, when he blinked a tear came out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin your happiness, Mitch told me you were happy with Michael\u201d he wipes the tear away.</p><p>\u201cI am happy with Michale,\u201d you say sternly. It felt weird to say, especially to Harry.</p><p>\u201cI know! That\u2019s why I could never do this! You are finally happy after so long.\u201d he exclaimed throwing his hands up in the air. \u201cI saw the invitation <g class=\"gr_ gr_248 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"248\" data-gr-id=\"248\">on</g> Mitch\u2019s fridge, and I had to get away. While I was gone, all I did was think about you.\u00a0I knew this would be my last chance\u201d he pauses.</p><p>\u201cY/N when you left me, I so was caught up in the fame and the money, everything was crazy. And you were always there through everything. When you were gone I <g class=\"gr_ gr_251 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"251\" data-gr-id=\"251\">realised</g> I had nothing without you. You were my happiness, you complete me\u201d Your expression is blank. You didn\u2019t know how to feel. Tears started welling up in your eyes, you tried to blink them back, but that only made them spill out.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve tried, Y/N trust me I\u2019ve tried to move on, but I can\u2019t, your it for me. I love you. I never stopped, and whether you marry Michale today, I will still love you, for the rest of my life\u201d There were tears running down both of your faces.\u00a0\"Don\u2019t <g class=\"gr_ gr_256 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"256\" data-gr-id=\"256\">cry</g>\u201c he says \"Your gonna mess up your pretty <g class=\"gr_ gr_257 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"257\" data-gr-id=\"257\">face</g>\u201d he said wiping a tear away on your cheek. You push his hand <g class=\"gr_ gr_598 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"598\" data-gr-id=\"598\">off</g> you and step back.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just come to me and say all of this! And on my wedding day? Of all the days, you chose today? Harry, you have always had bad timing, but this, this is just the worst.\u201d You\u2019re angry but relieved at the same time. If he wasn\u2019t here right now, you would be standing at the alter about to commit to something you weren\u2019t 100% sure about.</p><p>\u201cYou always ruin everything good for me! God, when Michael asked me to be his girlfriend, your album came out the same fucking day!\u201d you\u2019re still yelling, even though you relived you still needed to vent your feelings.</p><p>\u201cEverything I do, it\u2019s like your ghost is there haunting me\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were so good Y/N, we were so in love\u201d Harry pleads, taking your hands into his. His hands were warm, how they always were. Your hands fit perfectly in his.</p><p>\u201cIt was good, I loved you\u201d you emphasized the loved, and pull away from his grip. \u201cHarry your too late, I love Michale, and he makes me <g class=\"gr_ gr_236 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"236\" data-gr-id=\"236\">happy</g>\u201d you say, mostly to convince yourself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed, losing you made me <g class=\"gr_ gr_227 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"227\" data-gr-id=\"227\">reali</g>-\"\u00a0</p><p>\"You should go,\u201d you say interrupting him. You couldn\u2019t let him stop your wedding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N please,\u201d he says with so much emotion in his voice, while wiping the tears from his eyes. You sit back down and start trying to fix to fix the mess you had made of your makeup. You get lost in thought as you dab at you undereye. Harry then sets a box down on the vanity in front of you. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d you ask him.</p><p>He opens it, and inside is a ring. The most beautiful ring you had ever seen. Three sparkling diamonds, with two rubies on each side. It was the exact ring you wanted. You remember back to the drunk conversation you had so many years ago when you told him about your dream ring. \u201cI got it the month before you broke up with me. I was going to propose to you Y/N\u201d You look up at him.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d you say slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, perfect even, how, how did you remember?\u201d you say quickly while picking up the box to get a closer look.</p><p>\u201cI always <g class=\"gr_ gr_229 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"229\" data-gr-id=\"229\">remember</g>\u201d he says.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?!\u201d You ask him angrily. \u201cIf you loved me so much you were going to propose, why didn\u2019t you fucking tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was stupid Y/N, you broke my heart, and I didn\u2019t think you would want me back.\u201d The sadness in his eyes made you feel so much guilt. You try not let it get to you.</p><p>\u201cBut I kept it, I looked at it every night, contemplating whether I should have picked up the phone, and told you.\u201d You find yourself wishing he called.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of telling him how you feel, you shut the box and place it in his hands. \u201cI have to go, Harry, everyone is waiting\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I\u2019m so sorry Y/N, I\u2019m sorry I let you down\u201d You close his hands around the box, and pull him in for a hug.

You go in for a hug, as it had been a while since you last saw him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow, you look <g class=\"gr_ gr_234 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"234\" data-gr-id=\"234\">amazing</g>\u201d he says looking at you up and down.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mitch.

Why? He wasn\u2019t invited?\u201d you question him. \u201cI know, I told him he shouldn\u2019t be here, but he just showed up out of the blue. I told him to go home.\u201d Mitch says with a smidge of annoyance in his voice.</p><p>The door behind you opens, and the same cologne you smelt before instantly fills your nose. You knew it isn\u2019t the dress fitter as you look at Mitch\u2019s face, his expression is a mix of confusion and anger. You then turn around to see him standing there. He is wearing a black suit, dressed for the wedding. But he wasn\u2019t a guest.</p><p>His eyes lock on you, he gazes over your entire body, his eyes soften and his mouth gapes slightly. \u201cYou-you look beautiful\u201d he stuttered out walking closer to you.\u00a0</p><p>Mitch just looks at the two of you \u201cI\u2019m gonna go back to my seat\u201d he says walking out the door. \u201cMitch?

Michale won\u2019t be happy if he sees you\u201d you look into his eyes, they are so familiar. More memories come flooding back of all the goodness you shared with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were getting married?\u201d he says quietly, his voice is shaky, he isn\u2019t angry, just hurt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry!\u201d you raise your voice, he flinches at your change in tone.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken in years, and the album, god, I didn\u2019t know what to say?\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou could have called,\u201d he says slowly, looking up at you. \u201cYou could have called too!\u201d you yell.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, but, I don\u2019t know! I thought you would come back, like all the other times. But you never did, you moved on, found someone else, and now your getting married\u201d he says throwing his hands up gesturing to your dress and everything around you. \u201cI was stupid, I was so caught up in everything, I didn\u2019t <g class=\"gr_ gr_255 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"255\" data-gr-id=\"255\">realise</g> that I wasn\u2019t enough for you.

It felt weird to say, especially to Harry.</p><p>\u201cI know! That\u2019s why I could never do this! You are finally happy after so long.\u201d he exclaimed throwing his hands up in the air. \u201cI saw the invitation <g class=\"gr_ gr_248 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"248\" data-gr-id=\"248\">on</g> Mitch\u2019s fridge, and I had to get away. While I was gone, all I did was think about you.\u00a0I knew this would be my last chance\u201d he pauses.</p><p>\u201cY/N when you left me, I so was caught up in the fame and the money, everything was crazy. And you were always there through everything. When you were gone I <g class=\"gr_ gr_251 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"251\" data-gr-id=\"251\">realised</g> I had nothing without you. You were my happiness, you complete me\u201d Your expression is blank. You didn\u2019t know how to feel. Tears started welling up in your eyes, you tried to blink them back, but that only made them spill out.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve tried, Y/N trust me I\u2019ve tried to move on, but I can\u2019t, your it for me. I love you. I never stopped, and whether you marry Michale today, I will still love you, for the rest of my life\u201d There were tears running down both of your faces.\u00a0\"Don\u2019t <g class=\"gr_ gr_256 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"256\" data-gr-id=\"256\">cry</g>\u201c he says \"Your gonna mess up your pretty <g class=\"gr_ gr_257 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"257\" data-gr-id=\"257\">face</g>\u201d he said wiping a tear away on your cheek.

And on my wedding day? Of all the days, you chose today? Harry, you have always had bad timing, but this, this is just the worst.\u201d You\u2019re angry but relieved at the same time. If he wasn\u2019t here right now, you would be standing at the alter about to commit to something you weren\u2019t 100% sure about.</p><p>\u201cYou always ruin everything good for me! God, when Michael asked me to be his girlfriend, your album came out the same fucking day!\u201d you\u2019re still yelling, even though you relived you still needed to vent your feelings.</p><p>\u201cEverything I do, it\u2019s like your ghost is there haunting me\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were so good Y/N, we were so in love\u201d Harry pleads, taking your hands into his. His hands were warm, how they always were. Your hands fit perfectly in his.</p><p>\u201cIt was good, I loved you\u201d you emphasized the loved, and pull away from his grip. \u201cHarry your too late, I love Michale, and he makes me <g class=\"gr_ gr_236 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"236\" data-gr-id=\"236\">happy</g>\u201d you say, mostly to convince yourself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed, losing you made me <g class=\"gr_ gr_227 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"227\" data-gr-id=\"227\">reali</g>-\"\u00a0</p><p>\"You should go,\u201d you say interrupting him. You couldn\u2019t let him stop your wedding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N please,\u201d he says with so much emotion in his voice, while wiping the tears from his eyes. You sit back down and start trying to fix to fix the mess you had made of your makeup. You get lost in thought as you dab at you undereye. Harry then sets a box down on the vanity in front of you. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d you ask him.</p><p>He opens it, and inside is a ring. The most beautiful ring you had ever seen. Three sparkling diamonds, with two rubies on each side. It was the exact ring you wanted. You remember back to the drunk conversation you had so many years ago when you told him about your dream ring. \u201cI got it the month before you broke up with me. I was going to propose to you Y/N\u201d You look up at him.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d you say slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, perfect even, how, how did you remember?\u201d you say quickly while picking up the box to get a closer look.</p><p>\u201cI always <g class=\"gr_ gr_229 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"229\" data-gr-id=\"229\">remember</g>\u201d he says.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?!\u201d You ask him angrily. \u201cIf you loved me so much you were going to propose, why didn\u2019t you fucking tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was stupid Y/N, you broke my heart, and I didn\u2019t think you would want me back.\u201d The sadness in his eyes made you feel so much guilt. You try not let it get to you.</p><p>\u201cBut I kept it, I looked at it every night, contemplating whether I should have picked up the phone, and told you.\u201d You find yourself wishing he called.\u00a0</p><p>Instead of telling him how you feel, you shut the box and place it in his hands. \u201cI have to go, Harry, everyone is waiting\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I\u2019m so sorry Y/N, I\u2019m sorry I let you down\u201d You close his hands around the box, and pull him in for a hug. The hug lasted for a long time. You could feel him crying as he buries his head into your hair, inhaling your scent for what would be the last time. The hug was a goodbye, and you both knew that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood <g class=\"gr_ gr_242 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"242\" data-gr-id=\"242\">luck</g>\u201d he says, pulling away. You wished the hug could last forever. \u201cI hope he can make you <g class=\"gr_ gr_243 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"243\" data-gr-id=\"243\">happy</g>\u201d he says putting the box back into the pocket of his tailored black suit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoodbye Harry,\u201d you say leaving out the door. You didn\u2019t know what to feel. Everything Harry said was everything you wanted to hear but at the wrong time.\u00a0</p><p>You meet up with Grace, and she gives you a look. \u201cI\u2019m fine, let\u2019s do this,\u201d you say, trying to convince your self that this is the right decision. The music starts playing and you walk down the aisle, all your friends and family rise and look at you in awe. You\u2019re clutching your bouquet so tight, your hands are white. This was it, too late to turn back now.</p><p>When Michale turns around to look at you, he wipes a tear from his eye. He looks so handsome. As you grab his hand joining him facing the priest, he whispers to you \u201cYou look amazing\u201d while he squeezes your a hand.</p><p>\u201cSo do <g class=\"gr_ gr_260 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"260\" data-gr-id=\"260\">you</g>\u201d you say smiling. As the priest goes on, the feeling of uncertainty rises in your chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Michale whispers in your ear. You look at him with confusion on your face. What does he mean? Of course, you want to do this, don\u2019t you?\u00a0\"You have to do what makes you happy\" he continues, \u201cI just want you to be happy\u201d Did he see Harry? Did Harry talk to him? Your head is now spinning, why did this have to happen today, of all days, on your wedding day. You look at Michael, then look to the door you entered through. Were you really about to do this?</p><p>Tears are streaming down your face, you look at Michael and kiss him on the cheek, and whisper in his ear \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d Picking up your skirt you\u00a0run back down the aisle. Guests are giving you horrified looks as gasps and chatter fill the church. Michale\u2019s mother suddenly stands up, then your own mother and they just watch you run. No one stops you though. Everything is a blur, you see Mitch in the crowd of people, he sitting down, and he gives you a weak smile.</p><p>When you get out of the church into the parking lot, holding up as much of your expensive white dress as you can, you look for the black range rover you knew he would be in. You spot it and surely make your way over, it starts moving, he\u2019s leaving. He obviously hasn\u2019t seen you. As he turns out of the parking lot, and onto the street, you kick off your shoes and start running.\u00a0</p><p>\"Harry! Stop!\u201d you yell after the car. You then stop in the middle of the street as its no use. Just as you stop so does the car. He gets out, his face is red from crying. He runs to you, and you run to him. As you meet you jump into to him, wrapping your legs around his waist, just like you would do in the airport when he got back from a tour.</p><p>His lips immediately crash into yours. You kiss him like your life depended on it. It felt so good, it had been so many years since your lips were on his. \u201cI fucking hate <g class=\"gr_ gr_247 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"247\" data-gr-id=\"247\">you</g>\u201d you say to him breathlessly between kisses. He is holding on to you so tight like he would never let you go.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love <g class=\"gr_ gr_238 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"238\" data-gr-id=\"238\">you</g>\u201d he says laughing. You continue kissing, without a care in the world. Even though you just abandoned your own wedding, you didn\u2019t care because kissing Harry at this moment felt so right.</p><p>\u201cI promise I will be everything you want, I love you Y/N\u201d he carries you to the passenger seat of his car, and you get in stuffing you dress so it doesn\u2019t get caught in the door. He gets in and drives. He stops at a nearby park. You look at him \u201cWhat about the wedding?\u201d he asks you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say sighing. \u201cI just knew if I said \u2018I do\u2019, I would regret <g class=\"gr_ gr_2191 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"2191\" data-gr-id=\"2191\">it</g>\u201d you say turning to him, taking his hands into yours.</p><p>\u201cYou will always be a part of my life, I will always love you and I can\u2019t just pretend I don\u2019t. I was doing that for so long, and you made me <g class=\"gr_ gr_253 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"253\" data-gr-id=\"253\">realise</g> I can\u2019t ignore my feelings. I can\u2019t just push them to the side and think they will go away.\u201d He looks into your eyes, and he has the biggest smile on his face, it\u2019s contagious. You smile back at him.</p><p>\u201cA little part of me was always wishing it was you and not him, and when he turned around at the altar, I wanted it to be you. I don\u2019t care about what our future holds, all I know is right now, I want to be with you.\u201d You squeeze his hands so tight.</p><p>\"I promise to love you and make you happy.\u201d he pulls you in for a hug, followed by a long passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou are the love of my <g class=\"gr_ gr_228 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"228\" data-gr-id=\"228\">life</g>\u201d he says when he pulls away.</p><p>You knew you had done the right thing.</p></p>",

You couldn&rsquo;t let him stop your wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N please,&rdquo; he says with so much emotion in his voice, while wiping the tears from his eyes. You sit back down and start trying to fix to fix the mess you had made of your makeup. You get lost in thought as you dab at you undereye. Harry then sets a box down on the vanity in front of you. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; you ask him.</p><p>He opens it, and inside is a ring. The most beautiful ring you had ever seen. Three sparkling diamonds, with two rubies on each side. It was the exact ring you wanted. You remember back to the drunk conversation you had so many years ago when you told him about your dream ring. &ldquo;I got it the month before you broke up with me. I was going to propose to you Y/N&rdquo; You look up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; you say slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, perfect even, how, how did you remember?&rdquo; you say quickly while picking up the box to get a closer look.</p><p>&ldquo;I always remember&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?!&rdquo; You ask him angrily. &ldquo;If you loved me so much you were going to propose, why didn&rsquo;t you fucking tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was stupid Y/N, you broke my heart, and I didn&rsquo;t think you would want me back.&rdquo; The sadness in his eyes made you feel so much guilt. You try not let it get to you.</p><p>&ldquo;But I kept it, I looked at it every night, contemplating whether I should have picked up the phone, and told you.&rdquo; You find yourself wishing he called.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of telling him how you feel, you shut the box and place it in his hands. &ldquo;I have to go, Harry, everyone is waiting\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"I&rsquo;m so sorry Y/N, I&rsquo;m sorry I let you down&rdquo; You close his hands around the box, and pull him in for a hug. The hug lasted for a long time. You could feel him crying as he buries his head into your hair, inhaling your scent for what would be the last time. The hug was a goodbye, and you both knew that.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good luck&rdquo; he says, pulling away. You wished the hug could last forever. &ldquo;I hope he can make you happy&rdquo; he says putting the box back into the pocket of his tailored black suit.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Goodbye Harry,&rdquo; you say leaving out the door. You didn&rsquo;t know what to feel. Everything Harry said was everything you wanted to hear but at the wrong time.&nbsp;</p><p>You meet up with Grace, and she gives you a look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, let&rsquo;s do this,&rdquo; you say, trying to convince your self that this is the right decision. The music starts playing and you walk down the aisle, all your friends and family rise and look at you in awe. You&rsquo;re clutching your bouquet so tight, your hands are white. This was it, too late to turn back now.</p><p>When Michale turns around to look at you, he wipes a tear from his eye. He looks so handsome. As you grab his hand joining him facing the priest, he whispers to you &ldquo;You look amazing&rdquo; while he squeezes your a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;So do you&rdquo; you say smiling. As the priest goes on, the feeling of uncertainty rises in your chest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?&rdquo; Michale whispers in your ear. You look at him with confusion on your face. What does he mean? Of course, you want to do this, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;\"You have to do what makes you happy\" he continues, &ldquo;I just want you to be happy&rdquo; Did he see Harry? Did Harry talk to him? Your head is now spinning, why did this have to happen today, of all days, on your wedding day. You look at Michael, then look to the door you entered through. Were you really about to do this?</p><p>Tears are streaming down your face, you look at Michael and kiss him on the cheek, and whisper in his ear &ldquo;I am so sorry.&rdquo; Picking up your skirt you&nbsp;run back down the aisle. Guests are giving you horrified looks as gasps and chatter fill the church. Michale&rsquo;s mother suddenly stands up, then your own mother and they just watch you run. No one stops you though. Everything is a blur, you see Mitch in the crowd of people, he sitting down, and he gives you a weak smile.</p><p>When you get out of the church into the parking lot, holding up as much of your expensive white dress as you can, you look for the black range rover you knew he would be in. You spot it and surely make your way over, it starts moving, he&rsquo;s leaving. He obviously hasn&rsquo;t seen you. As he turns out of the parking lot, and onto the street, you kick off your shoes and start running.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Harry! Stop!&rdquo; you yell after the car. You then stop in the middle of the street as its no use. Just as you stop so does the car. He gets out, his face is red from crying. He runs to you, and you run to him. As you meet you jump into to him, wrapping your legs around his waist, just like you would do in the airport when he got back from a tour.</p><p>His lips immediately crash into yours. You kiss him like your life depended on it. It felt so good, it had been so many years since your lips were on his. &ldquo;I fucking hate you&rdquo; you say to him breathlessly between kisses. He is holding on to you so tight like he would never let you go.</p><p>&ldquo;I fucking love you&rdquo; he says laughing. You continue kissing, without a care in the world. Even though you just abandoned your own wedding, you didn&rsquo;t care because kissing Harry at this moment felt so right.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise I will be everything you want, I love you Y/N&rdquo; he carries you to the passenger seat of his car, and you get in stuffing you dress so it doesn&rsquo;t get caught in the door. He gets in and drives. He stops at a nearby park. You look at him &ldquo;What about the wedding?&rdquo; he asks you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you say sighing. &ldquo;I just knew if I said &lsquo;I do&rsquo;, I would regret it&rdquo; you say turning to him, taking his hands into yours.</p><p>&ldquo;You will always be a part of my life, I will always love you and I can&rsquo;t just pretend I don&rsquo;t. I was doing that for so long, and you made me realise I can&rsquo;t ignore my feelings. I can&rsquo;t just push them to the side and think they will go away.&rdquo; He looks into your eyes, and he has the biggest smile on his face, it&rsquo;s contagious. You smile back at him.</p><p>&ldquo;A little part of me was always wishing it was you and not him, and when he turned around at the altar, I wanted it to be you. I don&rsquo;t care about what our future holds, all I know is right now, I want to be with you.&rdquo; You squeeze his hands so tight.</p><p>\"I promise to love you and make you happy.&rdquo; he pulls you in for a hug, followed by a long passionate kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;You are the love of my life&rdquo; he says when he pulls away.</p><p>You knew you had done the right thing.</p></p>",
