            "description": "In addition to the pain and the exhaustion, he recalled how waiting on the cross between takes became tedious. To fight the boredom, he listened to music on headphones. One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",

The truth was that the holiday of Valentine\u2019s Day never showed me much mercy for constantly being single on the day. Sure I\u2019ve had a few or so guys come along, but for some reason they never managed to stick around long enough to celebrate the holiday with me. I was forced to watch an endless amount of ads and commercials targeted at the many loving couples of the world throughout the beginning and middle of February, and the sight of decorations put up in the stores and some restaurants. Everywhere I went I was constantly reminded of my loneliness. All in all, Valentine\u2019s Day seemed to have a thing against me, and there was nothing I could do about it. The only plus side for the mere existence of this so-called holiday was all the discounted chocolates and candies in the stores the very next day. It was the perfect excuse to allow myself to indulge in my love for sweets without wasting too much of my money.</p><p>\u00a0While all of those things have been a part of my life for the past few years, this year was the total opposite. This time around I had a boyfriend to celebrate with, one I knew would do so much just to impress me. Dating Keanu Reeves was a privilege that I only ever dreamed of having, and I still wasn\u2019t too sure if this was real life. \u00a0Yes, Keanu Reeves, that beautiful angel of a man, was all mine. I expected this day to be the best so far, and I had every reason to. Somehow, I woke up to find myself alone in our shared bed. I went to bed alone but Keanu told me that he would be home by the time I was up in the morning. All of the sudden my mind started drifting into negative thoughts, most of them fueled by my self-doubt. \u00a0I mentally rolled my eyes at myself, knowing how Keanu would react if he knew I had these thoughts. After rolling onto my other side, I checked my phone and saw that there were no notifications, other than those from my social media apps. \u2018<i>Why hasn\u2019t Keanu texted or called me?</i>\u2019 With a sigh, I got out of bed and grabbed my phone, heading down the hall to the kitchen. Once I noticed that nothing was different, that there was no bouquet of my favorite flowers or any small present, that small amount of hope left in me had faded. The best thing for me to do was to just go about my day like it was any other boring one.</p><!-- more --><p>\u00a0Within an hour, I had made some coffee and breakfast for myself and sat down on the couch to watch some of the news. I checked my phone again, this time reading my notifications from my twitter, instagram, and facebook. My most recent post on instagram was a photo I took of Keanu and I when we were out having lunch the other afternoon. Keanu had a slight smirk on his face as he looked at me longingly. I remember getting my phone out to capture his demeanor, knowing that I could always have it to view whenever I was missing him. Now, while Keanu looked like a cute little puppy \u2013 as he usually did \u2013 I was a grinning idiot. I noticed my hair was a little messy from the light breeze and there was a stain on my shirt from the piece of pasta that I had just dropped myself. There were a ton of likes and comments, with more being added even though the post was already a little over a week old. I smiled to myself at the sweet comments made by family, friends, and strangers. \u00a0I turned my phone off and returned my attention to the television before turning it off as well. At that point, I didn\u2019t have any motivation to do anything. After scrambling around the thoughts of what I could or should do, I decided to go into the study room and practice playing on my upright piano. I then spent nearly half an hour messing around with scales and random bits of songs that I remembered well enough to play, I heard someone softly clap, causing me to jump with a shriek and somehow fall off of the piano bench. </p><p>\u201cGood one, hon.\u201d Keanu laughed, moving towards me to help me up. I felt every inch of my body tingle and spark with both excitement and pleasure once Keanu\u2019s hand touched my arm. I let out an involuntary moan of joy, causing Keanu to let out another small laugh. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really missed me that much, huh?\u201d He asked with a smile, knowing good and well that I had. I felt a warm blush spread across my cheeks as I smiled sheepishly and pulled Keanu down to the floor. He obliged and sat down besides me, suddenly grabbing me to face him, his arms wrapped around me. </p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s an eager boy,\u201d I replied as I wrapped my legs around his waist, giving him a soft peck on his lips. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned right I am.\u201d He growled, crashing his lips against mine. I managed to let out a quick snicker before he shoved his tongue into my mouth. I was more than welcoming of his taste, which mainly consisted of cigarettes and spearmint gum. This time I could taste a slight hint of coffee and maple syrup, causing me to hum in delight. I pulled away and looked up at him, his face showing confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou had me worried for the last few hours,\u201d I admitted, causing Keanu to give me an apologetic look with his big brown puppy eyes. \u201cI thought I would spend today all alone.\u201d Keanu frowned and placed a kiss on my forehead. He lifted my chin so I was looking at him. </p><p>\u201cDid you really think I would do that to you, (y/n)?\u201d He gave me another saddened look before holding me against his chest. </p><p>\u201cI would never do that to you, baby.\u201d He muttered, giving me another kiss, this time on the top of my head. \u201cNot a fucking thing could drag me away from you. If I can help it, I will spend as much time with you, especially on a special day like this one. You are my entire world, (y/n). Never forget that.\u201d</p><p>There was a slight pause, one filled with only the sound of our breathing. </p><p>\u201cKe-keanu,\u201d I stumbled as I pulled away to look at the older man, making him grin. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d He cupped my face with his hands, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d I was suddenly pulled into another kiss, his tongue sliding across my lips before entering my mouth. I decided to play along and fight for dominance. After a quick hum from Keanu, I managed to overtake him and slide my tongue into his mouth. I slowly made my way around his teeth, once again cherishing the unique taste of tobacco and mint. Keanu then pushed me away, grinning like a child who had just tasted candy for the first time.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he started, running his hand through my hair. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the chance to do anything in this room.\u201d I felt the heat rise to my face before I managed to give him a smirk. </p><p>\u201cThen wait are you waiting for, Keanu?\u201d I whispered, knowing how much it turns him on. And right on cue, his deep brown eyes seemed to grow dark with lust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really done it this time, (y/n).\u201d He maneuvered himself to where he was on top of me. \u201cI <i>have</i> to fuck you. I <i>need</i> to fuck you.\u201d He let out with a groan, grabbing the sides of my torso and running his large hands up and down my body. Without a second thought, I felt my core begin to ache as my panties became damp. \u2018And all it took was his voice,\u2019 I thought to myself, wondering how I ever became so submissive to a man. </p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whimpered. \u201c<i>Daddy</i>.\u201d With that, Keanu groaned loudly and began to strip me, starting with his Arch shirt I was wearing. I hadn\u2019t changed after getting out of bed, so I wasn\u2019t wearing a bra or any pants. Left only in my panties, he ran his nose from my navel up to the valley between my breasts. I felt his hot mouth as he planted soft kisses all over me before he went for my collarbone. I let out a sigh of relief when his tongue touched my skin and he began to leave bite marks on me, making sure to suck on them so there would definitely be dark marks for later. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry my angel, but we\u2019ve gotta skip the foreplay if we\u2019re gonna make it to lunch on time.\u201d Keanu stated, standing up to pull off his t-shirt and jeans, as well as his underwear. I stared at the sight of a fucking god in front of me. My eyes traced over his well-toned body and his semi-hard cock. I took notice of his infamous scar that marked his abdomen, conjuring thoughts of my tongue in the slight valley of the scar. I licked my lips and felt myself burn and ache for him even more. He was down on his knees and hovering over me, grabbing a fistful of my thin panties before swiftly ripping them off of me. </p><p>\u201cKeanu!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hush, woman.\u201d </p><p>I let out a huff of annoyance but it was instantly replaced with a guttural moan once Keanu thrust two fingers inside of me with no warning. </p><p>\u201cMhm, that\u2019s what Daddy needs to hear from his baby girl.\u201d He praised, pumping in and out of me at a gentle pace. I could hear the sound of my soaked sex being penetrated by his fingers, further edging me on. As soon as I began trying to grind my hips against his touch, Keanu clicked his tongue and shook his head. </p><p>I let out another whimper for him, begging him to fuck me. He leaned down to kiss me, his swollen lips molding perfectly with mine. </p><p>\u201c<i>Please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away, grabbing his cock and beginning to pump himself. I gave him a pleading look to let me touch him, and so he slid up to my reach. I replaced his hand with my smaller one, starting at his head and rubbing his precum down on him to lubricate him. Just to tease him, I pulled my hand away, gave it a lick, and sat up to spit on it. The face of my lover had become contorted with a mix of anticipation and desire once my slick hand touched his shaft. </p><p>\u201c(Y/n),\u201d Keanu moaned. \u201cFuck..\u201d I smiled at my achievement and continued to jerk him, feeling his cock grow harder. He let out a deep growl of annoyance before jerking away from my touch. I was going to ask what he was doing but I was cut off with my own shriek once Keanu shoved his entire length inside of me. He filled me entirely to the point where his tip was jammed against the back of me, the feeling that practically pulled moans from my mouth. </p><p>\u201cMmm, Keanu.\u201d I breathed, moving my hand to my clit and rubbing tiny circles onto it. Keanu shut his eyes as he moved slightly in and out of me, making sure I could adjust to him. He shuddered with pleasure, my walls quickly loosening their grip on his cock. Within a matter of a few seconds, Keanu was able to slide in and out of me with little resistance. I hummed to myself, letting out another string of soft moans as the combined effort of Keanu\u2019s cock and my fingers on my clit pushing me closer to climax. Once his hands tightened their grip on my hips, his fingernails going deeper into my skin, I quickened the movements of my busy hand. I looked back up at Keanu and he moved down to kiss me, quite sloppily, and began to thrust faster and harder. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close,\u201d I whimpered, and he responded with a nod and a harsh groan. </p><p>\u201cMe fucking too.\u201d Keanu growled as he flipped us. I gasped at the change, giving him a slightly bothered look. </p><p>\u201cJust ride me, <i>baby girl</i>.\u201d He purred as he bounced me up and down. I gave in and started bouncing myself, starting at a quick pace. Keanu smiled before he leaned up to kiss and suck on my right breast, swirling his tongue around my nipple. He bit down rather roughly, earning a yelp from me. After leaving possible marks, he made his way to my left breast and nipple, giving it the same treatment. I groaned as I managed to flip us back to our original position, which I preferred to be in when I\u2019m coming. Keanu\u2019s thrusts became quicker and sloppier, now only moving an inch or so within me instead of pulling himself in and out completely. I let out a low growl as my fingers were rubbing against my clit at an inhuman speed, feeling the much-anticipated fire in my abdomen burn even hotter. </p><p>\u201cCome for me, (y/n).\u201d Keanu moaned, his voice low and harsh. \u201c<i>Come for Daddy.</i>\u201d As soon as the sentence left his mouth, I felt the bundle inside of me snap and release the agonizing pressure built up within it. I felt hot liquid push against and soak my hand, Keanu noticing and replacing that hand with his. He always enjoyed it whenever I squirted, especially when giving me head because he could lap it all up with his tongue. My body had been overcome with all kinds of slight convulsions, such as my toes curling, my head being thrust back, my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and my entire body quaking in pleasure and complete bliss. Before I could even begin to come down from my high, the sound of Keanu letting out a loud mixture of a moan and a yelp interrupted me. He cried my name as my walls had squeezed around him, and I felt his cock grow softer once he emptied himself inside me.</p><p>Keanu pulled out of me and flopped himself onto the dark wood floor. I giggled softly, grabbing his attention. He pulled me into his grasp and kissed me tenderly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely perfect, (y/n).\u201d He breathed as he looked into my eyes with his dark brown ones, which now had a pure and blissful look in them. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I replied with a grin, causing him to roll his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell, beautiful,\u201d he looked down at us and then to the clock on the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve got a romantic lunch set up for you, and I\u2019d hate to miss it.\u201d</p>",

The best thing for me to do was to just go about my day like it was any other boring one.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u00a0Within an hour, I had made some coffee and breakfast for myself and sat down on the couch to watch some of the news. I checked my phone again, this time reading my notifications from my twitter, instagram, and facebook. My most recent post on instagram was a photo I took of Keanu and I when we were out having lunch the other afternoon. Keanu had a slight smirk on his face as he looked at me longingly. I remember getting my phone out to capture his demeanor, knowing that I could always have it to view whenever I was missing him. Now, while Keanu looked like a cute little puppy \u2013 as he usually did \u2013 I was a grinning idiot.

And right on cue, his deep brown eyes seemed to grow dark with lust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really done it this time, (y/n).\u201d He maneuvered himself to where he was on top of me. \u201cI <i>have</i> to fuck you.

Without a second thought, I felt my core begin to ache as my panties became damp. \u2018And all it took was his voice,\u2019 I thought to myself, wondering how I ever became so submissive to a man. </p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whimpered. \u201c<i>Daddy</i>.\u201d With that, Keanu groaned loudly and began to strip me, starting with his Arch shirt I was wearing.

I took notice of his infamous scar that marked his abdomen, conjuring thoughts of my tongue in the slight valley of the scar. I licked my lips and felt myself burn and ache for him even more. He was down on his knees and hovering over me, grabbing a fistful of my thin panties before swiftly ripping them off of me. </p><p>\u201cKeanu!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hush, woman.\u201d </p><p>I let out a huff of annoyance but it was instantly replaced with a guttural moan once Keanu thrust two fingers inside of me with no warning. </p><p>\u201cMhm, that\u2019s what Daddy needs to hear from his baby girl.\u201d He praised, pumping in and out of me at a gentle pace.

I looked back up at Keanu and he moved down to kiss me, quite sloppily, and began to thrust faster and harder. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close,\u201d I whimpered, and he responded with a nod and a harsh groan. </p><p>\u201cMe fucking too.\u201d Keanu growled as he flipped us. I gasped at the change, giving him a slightly bothered look. </p><p>\u201cJust ride me, <i>baby girl</i>.\u201d He purred as he bounced me up and down. I gave in and started bouncing myself, starting at a quick pace. Keanu smiled before he leaned up to kiss and suck on my right breast, swirling his tongue around my nipple. He bit down rather roughly, earning a yelp from me. After leaving possible marks, he made his way to my left breast and nipple, giving it the same treatment. I groaned as I managed to flip us back to our original position, which I preferred to be in when I\u2019m coming. Keanu\u2019s thrusts became quicker and sloppier, now only moving an inch or so within me instead of pulling himself in and out completely. I let out a low growl as my fingers were rubbing against my clit at an inhuman speed, feeling the much-anticipated fire in my abdomen burn even hotter. </p><p>\u201cCome for me, (y/n).\u201d Keanu moaned, his voice low and harsh. \u201c<i>Come for Daddy.</i>\u201d As soon as the sentence left his mouth, I felt the bundle inside of me snap and release the agonizing pressure built up within it. I felt hot liquid push against and soak my hand, Keanu noticing and replacing that hand with his. He always enjoyed it whenever I squirted, especially when giving me head because he could lap it all up with his tongue.

The truth was that the holiday of Valentine\u2019s Day never showed me much mercy for constantly being single on the day. Sure I\u2019ve had a few or so guys come along, but for some reason they never managed to stick around long enough to celebrate the holiday with me. I was forced to watch an endless amount of ads and commercials targeted at the many loving couples of the world throughout the beginning and middle of February, and the sight of decorations put up in the stores and some restaurants. Everywhere I went I was constantly reminded of my loneliness. All in all, Valentine\u2019s Day seemed to have a thing against me, and there was nothing I could do about it. The only plus side for the mere existence of this so-called holiday was all the discounted chocolates and candies in the stores the very next day. It was the perfect excuse to allow myself to indulge in my love for sweets without wasting too much of my money.</p><p>\u00a0While all of those things have been a part of my life for the past few years, this year was the total opposite.

I expected this day to be the best so far, and I had every reason to. Somehow, I woke up to find myself alone in our shared bed. I went to bed alone but Keanu told me that he would be home by the time I was up in the morning. All of the sudden my mind started drifting into negative thoughts, most of them fueled by my self-doubt. \u00a0I mentally rolled my eyes at myself, knowing how Keanu would react if he knew I had these thoughts. After rolling onto my other side, I checked my phone and saw that there were no notifications, other than those from my social media apps. \u2018<i>Why hasn\u2019t Keanu texted or called me?</i>\u2019 With a sigh, I got out of bed and grabbed my phone, heading down the hall to the kitchen.

I checked my phone again, this time reading my notifications from my twitter, instagram, and facebook. My most recent post on instagram was a photo I took of Keanu and I when we were out having lunch the other afternoon. Keanu had a slight smirk on his face as he looked at me longingly. I remember getting my phone out to capture his demeanor, knowing that I could always have it to view whenever I was missing him. Now, while Keanu looked like a cute little puppy \u2013 as he usually did \u2013 I was a grinning idiot. I noticed my hair was a little messy from the light breeze and there was a stain on my shirt from the piece of pasta that I had just dropped myself. There were a ton of likes and comments, with more being added even though the post was already a little over a week old. I smiled to myself at the sweet comments made by family, friends, and strangers. \u00a0I turned my phone off and returned my attention to the television before turning it off as well. At that point, I didn\u2019t have any motivation to do anything. After scrambling around the thoughts of what I could or should do, I decided to go into the study room and practice playing on my upright piano. I then spent nearly half an hour messing around with scales and random bits of songs that I remembered well enough to play, I heard someone softly clap, causing me to jump with a shriek and somehow fall off of the piano bench. </p><p>\u201cGood one, hon.\u201d Keanu laughed, moving towards me to help me up. I felt every inch of my body tingle and spark with both excitement and pleasure once Keanu\u2019s hand touched my arm. I let out an involuntary moan of joy, causing Keanu to let out another small laugh. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really missed me that much, huh?\u201d He asked with a smile, knowing good and well that I had. I felt a warm blush spread across my cheeks as I smiled sheepishly and pulled Keanu down to the floor. He obliged and sat down besides me, suddenly grabbing me to face him, his arms wrapped around me. </p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s an eager boy,\u201d I replied as I wrapped my legs around his waist, giving him a soft peck on his lips. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned right I am.\u201d He growled, crashing his lips against mine. I managed to let out a quick snicker before he shoved his tongue into my mouth. I was more than welcoming of his taste, which mainly consisted of cigarettes and spearmint gum. This time I could taste a slight hint of coffee and maple syrup, causing me to hum in delight. I pulled away and looked up at him, his face showing confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou had me worried for the last few hours,\u201d I admitted, causing Keanu to give me an apologetic look with his big brown puppy eyes. \u201cI thought I would spend today all alone.\u201d Keanu frowned and placed a kiss on my forehead. He lifted my chin so I was looking at him. </p><p>\u201cDid you really think I would do that to you, (y/n)?\u201d He gave me another saddened look before holding me against his chest. </p><p>\u201cI would never do that to you, baby.\u201d He muttered, giving me another kiss, this time on the top of my head. \u201cNot a fucking thing could drag me away from you. If I can help it, I will spend as much time with you, especially on a special day like this one. You are my entire world, (y/n). Never forget that.\u201d</p><p>There was a slight pause, one filled with only the sound of our breathing. </p><p>\u201cKe-keanu,\u201d I stumbled as I pulled away to look at the older man, making him grin. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d He cupped my face with his hands, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d I was suddenly pulled into another kiss, his tongue sliding across my lips before entering my mouth. I decided to play along and fight for dominance. After a quick hum from Keanu, I managed to overtake him and slide my tongue into his mouth. I slowly made my way around his teeth, once again cherishing the unique taste of tobacco and mint. Keanu then pushed me away, grinning like a child who had just tasted candy for the first time.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he started, running his hand through my hair. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had the chance to do anything in this room.\u201d I felt the heat rise to my face before I managed to give him a smirk. </p><p>\u201cThen wait are you waiting for, Keanu?\u201d I whispered, knowing how much it turns him on. And right on cue, his deep brown eyes seemed to grow dark with lust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really done it this time, (y/n).\u201d He maneuvered himself to where he was on top of me. \u201cI <i>have</i> to fuck you. I <i>need</i> to fuck you.\u201d He let out with a groan, grabbing the sides of my torso and running his large hands up and down my body. Without a second thought, I felt my core begin to ache as my panties became damp. \u2018And all it took was his voice,\u2019 I thought to myself, wondering how I ever became so submissive to a man. </p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whimpered. \u201c<i>Daddy</i>.\u201d With that, Keanu groaned loudly and began to strip me, starting with his Arch shirt I was wearing. I hadn\u2019t changed after getting out of bed, so I wasn\u2019t wearing a bra or any pants. Left only in my panties, he ran his nose from my navel up to the valley between my breasts. I felt his hot mouth as he planted soft kisses all over me before he went for my collarbone. I let out a sigh of relief when his tongue touched my skin and he began to leave bite marks on me, making sure to suck on them so there would definitely be dark marks for later. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry my angel, but we\u2019ve gotta skip the foreplay if we\u2019re gonna make it to lunch on time.\u201d Keanu stated, standing up to pull off his t-shirt and jeans, as well as his underwear. I stared at the sight of a fucking god in front of me. My eyes traced over his well-toned body and his semi-hard cock. I took notice of his infamous scar that marked his abdomen, conjuring thoughts of my tongue in the slight valley of the scar. I licked my lips and felt myself burn and ache for him even more. He was down on his knees and hovering over me, grabbing a fistful of my thin panties before swiftly ripping them off of me. </p><p>\u201cKeanu!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hush, woman.\u201d </p><p>I let out a huff of annoyance but it was instantly replaced with a guttural moan once Keanu thrust two fingers inside of me with no warning. </p><p>\u201cMhm, that\u2019s what Daddy needs to hear from his baby girl.\u201d He praised, pumping in and out of me at a gentle pace. I could hear the sound of my soaked sex being penetrated by his fingers, further edging me on. As soon as I began trying to grind my hips against his touch, Keanu clicked his tongue and shook his head. </p><p>I let out another whimper for him, begging him to fuck me. He leaned down to kiss me, his swollen lips molding perfectly with mine. </p><p>\u201c<i>Please</i>.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away, grabbing his cock and beginning to pump himself. I gave him a pleading look to let me touch him, and so he slid up to my reach. I replaced his hand with my smaller one, starting at his head and rubbing his precum down on him to lubricate him. Just to tease him, I pulled my hand away, gave it a lick, and sat up to spit on it. The face of my lover had become contorted with a mix of anticipation and desire once my slick hand touched his shaft. </p><p>\u201c(Y/n),\u201d Keanu moaned. \u201cFuck..\u201d I smiled at my achievement and continued to jerk him, feeling his cock grow harder. He let out a deep growl of annoyance before jerking away from my touch. I was going to ask what he was doing but I was cut off with my own shriek once Keanu shoved his entire length inside of me. He filled me entirely to the point where his tip was jammed against the back of me, the feeling that practically pulled moans from my mouth. </p><p>\u201cMmm, Keanu.\u201d I breathed, moving my hand to my clit and rubbing tiny circles onto it. Keanu shut his eyes as he moved slightly in and out of me, making sure I could adjust to him. He shuddered with pleasure, my walls quickly loosening their grip on his cock. Within a matter of a few seconds, Keanu was able to slide in and out of me with little resistance. I hummed to myself, letting out another string of soft moans as the combined effort of Keanu\u2019s cock and my fingers on my clit pushing me closer to climax. Once his hands tightened their grip on my hips, his fingernails going deeper into my skin, I quickened the movements of my busy hand. I looked back up at Keanu and he moved down to kiss me, quite sloppily, and began to thrust faster and harder. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so close,\u201d I whimpered, and he responded with a nod and a harsh groan. </p><p>\u201cMe fucking too.\u201d Keanu growled as he flipped us. I gasped at the change, giving him a slightly bothered look. </p><p>\u201cJust ride me, <i>baby girl</i>.\u201d He purred as he bounced me up and down. I gave in and started bouncing myself, starting at a quick pace. Keanu smiled before he leaned up to kiss and suck on my right breast, swirling his tongue around my nipple. He bit down rather roughly, earning a yelp from me. After leaving possible marks, he made his way to my left breast and nipple, giving it the same treatment. I groaned as I managed to flip us back to our original position, which I preferred to be in when I\u2019m coming. Keanu\u2019s thrusts became quicker and sloppier, now only moving an inch or so within me instead of pulling himself in and out completely. I let out a low growl as my fingers were rubbing against my clit at an inhuman speed, feeling the much-anticipated fire in my abdomen burn even hotter. </p><p>\u201cCome for me, (y/n).\u201d Keanu moaned, his voice low and harsh. \u201c<i>Come for Daddy.</i>\u201d As soon as the sentence left his mouth, I felt the bundle inside of me snap and release the agonizing pressure built up within it. I felt hot liquid push against and soak my hand, Keanu noticing and replacing that hand with his. He always enjoyed it whenever I squirted, especially when giving me head because he could lap it all up with his tongue. My body had been overcome with all kinds of slight convulsions, such as my toes curling, my head being thrust back, my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and my entire body quaking in pleasure and complete bliss. Before I could even begin to come down from my high, the sound of Keanu letting out a loud mixture of a moan and a yelp interrupted me. He cried my name as my walls had squeezed around him, and I felt his cock grow softer once he emptied himself inside me.</p><p>Keanu pulled out of me and flopped himself onto the dark wood floor. I giggled softly, grabbing his attention. He pulled me into his grasp and kissed me tenderly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely perfect, (y/n).\u201d He breathed as he looked into my eyes with his dark brown ones, which now had a pure and blissful look in them. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I replied with a grin, causing him to roll his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell, beautiful,\u201d he looked down at us and then to the clock on the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve got a romantic lunch set up for you, and I\u2019d hate to miss it.\u201d</p></p>",

Keanu shut his eyes as he moved slightly in and out of me, making sure I could adjust to him. He shuddered with pleasure, my walls quickly loosening their grip on his cock. Within a matter of a few seconds, Keanu was able to slide in and out of me with little resistance. I hummed to myself, letting out another string of soft moans as the combined effort of Keanu&rsquo;s cock and my fingers on my clit pushing me closer to climax. Once his hands tightened their grip on my hips, his fingernails going deeper into my skin, I quickened the movements of my busy hand. I looked back up at Keanu and he moved down to kiss me, quite sloppily, and began to thrust faster and harder. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so close,&rdquo; I whimpered, and he responded with a nod and a harsh groan. </p><p>&ldquo;Me fucking too.&rdquo; Keanu growled as he flipped us. I gasped at the change, giving him a slightly bothered look. </p><p>&ldquo;Just ride me, <i>baby girl</i>.&rdquo; He purred as he bounced me up and down. I gave in and started bouncing myself, starting at a quick pace. Keanu smiled before he leaned up to kiss and suck on my right breast, swirling his tongue around my nipple. He bit down rather roughly, earning a yelp from me. After leaving possible marks, he made his way to my left breast and nipple, giving it the same treatment. I groaned as I managed to flip us back to our original position, which I preferred to be in when I&rsquo;m coming. Keanu&rsquo;s thrusts became quicker and sloppier, now only moving an inch or so within me instead of pulling himself in and out completely. I let out a low growl as my fingers were rubbing against my clit at an inhuman speed, feeling the much-anticipated fire in my abdomen burn even hotter. </p><p>&ldquo;Come for me, (y/n).&rdquo; Keanu moaned, his voice low and harsh. &ldquo;<i>Come for Daddy.</i>&rdquo; As soon as the sentence left his mouth, I felt the bundle inside of me snap and release the agonizing pressure built up within it. I felt hot liquid push against and soak my hand, Keanu noticing and replacing that hand with his. He always enjoyed it whenever I squirted, especially when giving me head because he could lap it all up with his tongue. My body had been overcome with all kinds of slight convulsions, such as my toes curling, my head being thrust back, my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and my entire body quaking in pleasure and complete bliss. Before I could even begin to come down from my high, the sound of Keanu letting out a loud mixture of a moan and a yelp interrupted me. He cried my name as my walls had squeezed around him, and I felt his cock grow softer once he emptied himself inside me.</p><p>Keanu pulled out of me and flopped himself onto the dark wood floor. I giggled softly, grabbing his attention. He pulled me into his grasp and kissed me tenderly. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely perfect, (y/n).&rdquo; He breathed as he looked into my eyes with his dark brown ones, which now had a pure and blissful look in them. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; I replied with a grin, causing him to roll his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, beautiful,&rdquo; he looked down at us and then to the clock on the wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a romantic lunch set up for you, and I&rsquo;d hate to miss it.&rdquo;</p></p>",

I love you.&nbsp;<br />\n</h2>\n<p>Tags: Fluff, Smut, a -slight- daddy kink but ya know oh well</p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&nbsp;The date was February 14, a day that I somehow found myself to despise and not really care about at the same time. The truth was that the holiday of Valentine&rsquo;s Day never showed me much mercy for constantly being single on the day. Sure I&rsquo;ve had a few or so guys come along, but for some reason they never managed to stick around long enough to celebrate the holiday with me. I was forced to watch an endless amount of ads and commercials targeted at the many loving couples of the world throughout the beginning and middle of February, and the sight of decorations put up in the stores and some restaurants. Everywhere I went I was constantly reminded of my loneliness. All in all, Valentine&rsquo;s Day seemed to have a thing against me, and there was nothing I could do about it. The only plus side for the mere existence of this so-called holiday was all the discounted chocolates and candies in the stores the very next day. It was the perfect excuse to allow myself to indulge in my love for sweets without wasting too much of my money.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;While all of those things have been a part of my life for the past few years, this year was the total opposite. This time around I had a boyfriend to celebrate with, one I knew would do so much just to impress me. Dating Keanu Reeves was a privilege that I only ever dreamed of having, and I still wasn&rsquo;t too sure if this was real life. &nbsp;Yes, Keanu Reeves, that beautiful angel of a man, was all mine. I expected this day to be the best so far, and I had every reason to. Somehow, I woke up to find myself alone in our shared bed. I went to bed alone but Keanu told me that he would be home by the time I was up in the morning. All of the sudden my mind started drifting into negative thoughts, most of them fueled by my self-doubt. &nbsp;I mentally rolled my eyes at myself, knowing how Keanu would react if he knew I had these thoughts. After rolling onto my other side, I checked my phone and saw that there were no notifications, other than those from my social media apps. &lsquo;<i>Why hasn&rsquo;t Keanu texted or called me?</i>&rsquo; With a sigh, I got out of bed and grabbed my phone, heading down the hall to the kitchen. Once I noticed that nothing was different, that there was no bouquet of my favorite flowers or any small present, that small amount of hope left in me had faded. The best thing for me to do was to just go about my day like it was any other boring one.</p>\n</p>",
