Here we see Cyrus explaining the meaning of a Shiva to Jonah, Andi, and Buffy. I would predict this is towards the beginning of the episode, similar to how the Bar Mitzvah episode got most of the Jewish traditions and conversations out of the way before the theme song so that the rest of the episode can focus more on the plot. This also implies that Jonah, Andi, and Buffy either arrive to the house together, or at least closely enough so that Cyrus only has to explain these details to his friends once. It also implies that TJ does not arrive at the same time as the others, and that he won\u2019t appear until later in the episode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"522\" data-orig-width=\"996\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d34c053fb0a22879ddbba43e4b72efa9/tumblr_inline_pmblc5nD8v1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"522\" data-orig-width=\"996\"/></figure><p>2. Next we see Buffy\u2019s phone vibrate, which offends/disturbs the other guests at the Shiva. Andi looks immediately uncomfortable. I am guessing this won\u2019t be the first time her phone has gone off in the episode. It has probably already happened a couple of times, but Andi hadn\u2019t said anything up until this point. This is the event that pushes Andi and Buffy outside, where they will talk to Cyrus.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1040\" data-orig-width=\"990\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fd70e4061adf2ff6f360c1efae30877/tumblr_inline_pmblinfaHP1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1040\" data-orig-width=\"990\"/></figure><p>3. Andi follows Buffy outside to confront her about who keeps trying to contact her, and Buffy walks away most likely to deal with it. I\u2019m not really gonna speculate on who it is in this post because it\u2019s not entirely relevant at the moment. What\u2019s important for this analysis are the physical shots we see here. This shows us that the green fencing and lawn furniture we see behind Buffy, is directly across from the windows and door to the house which we see behind Andi.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"993\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebca2daa70783602eee00cf4606961c1/tumblr_inline_pmblohqJW51rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"993\"/></figure><p>4. We can tell from this frame that Buffy and Andi were not alone in the back yard, but likely Cyrus was with them. There are three glasses and an empty chair sitting across from Buffy and Andi, which tells us that at some point, probably shortly after Buffy walks away to deal with her mysterious phone friend, the Good Hair Crew sits down to talk together. No idea where Jonah is during all of this but I guess that\u2019s not entirely relevant either.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1049\" data-orig-width=\"994\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cb84a955d68d6059c3fb80f0b5ea544/tumblr_inline_pmblryPa631rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1049\" data-orig-width=\"994\"/></figure><p>5. So now we have these two shots, which show Cyrus (note the windows) sitting across from Buffy and Andi (note the green fence). It\u2019s clear they are talking about something serious, given the look on Cyrus\u2019 face. We can assume that the conversation has shifted from who Buffy is texting, to Cyrus wanting to come out (most likely to his parents). I\u2019m not really predicting how this conversation starts or what triggers this decision, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. Cyrus wants to tell somebody the truth about his sexuality, and Andi responds with\u00a0\u201cIt is your choice who you tell, and when\u201d.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"994\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c1ca809f238f311b3ee1dfa9deb0082/tumblr_inline_pmblwfRmea1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"994\"/></figure><p>6. In this frame, what we are most likely looking at is Buffy and Andi watching Cyrus as he walks back into the house to find his parents and tell them the truth. They may have stood up from their seats at the same time as Cyrus, and hugged him or showed some other sign of physical support before he turned to go inside. Buffy seems to be holding back some kind of emotion, almost like she\u2019s holding her breath to appear strong. Andi lets out a deep breath and smiles. They both have almost motherly looks that convey a sense of pride as they watch him go to speak his truth.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1044\" data-orig-width=\"992\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4921b0a8fd108e8be58e46d8a231d06/tumblr_inline_pmbm1uhFlV1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1044\" data-orig-width=\"992\"/></figure><p>7. Now that Cyrus is back inside and out of sight, Buffy and Andi sit back down. The frame with the orange juice from above is also from this moment. At first, both Buffy and Andi are still smiling as they sit down. Andi is staring at the door, smiling. Buffy almost appears to let out a sigh of relief now that Cyrus can\u2019t see her. They are still focused on Cyrus, up until Buffy\u2019s phone vibrates again which leads Andi to ask if she\u2019s going to tell her. This shifts the focus back onto other drama/storylines and to one that is possibly lighter than the one with Cyrus which we have seen before on the show as a balancing tool.</p><p>And here is where things become a little less clear and venture more into personal theory rather than analysis&hellip; I am not sure if we will actually witness Cyrus coming out to his parents on screen or not. One theory I\u2019ve had is that he will decide to tell his parents, which will happen off-screen, and then he will return to his friends and confirm to them that it went well, and in doing so possibly reveal to Jonah and/or TJ that he came out to his parents, which would allow them to know that he\u2019s gay without having it feel repetitive. I could still see this as a likely possibility, but the promo doesn\u2019t really provide much insight either way (which is for the best - as we still want some surprises).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1046\" data-orig-width=\"991\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/11f18865ae489fdadff541e5165bf7e9/tumblr_inline_pmbmfiaZrw1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1046\" data-orig-width=\"991\"/></figure><p>8. These two shots appear to be connected, although the framing of the background is a little off. I predict that these are the moments that actually have to do with him coming out. In the first clip, he is nodding at someone and it almost conveys a feeling of confirmation. Like he either just said something (\u201dI\u2019m gay\u201d) and is nodding to convince himself that he said it out loud, OR the person who he\u2019s talking to asked for confirmation (\u201dAre you telling us you\u2019re gay?\u201d or \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re-\u201d) towards what he was trying to tell them. I\u2019m not actually trying to speculate what the conversation will entail, but more so the messages being conveyed by his facial expressions and body language.</p><p>The second frame is a confident smile. Like a weight has been lifted off of him, or like he is pleased with the reaction to the conversation he is having. He looks like he is <i>proud</i>.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1045\" data-orig-width=\"988\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f03256bec83212d29e5cd679e030ef31/tumblr_inline_pmbn367ed91rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1045\" data-orig-width=\"988\"/></figure><p>9. Although it\u2019s not made clear by the promo, I think it\u2019s safe to assume this moment between Buffy and Andi is a reaction related to Cyrus\u2019 coming out. The fact that they look at each other, and then look <i>at </i>whatever is going on almost makes it seem like they are staying back and watching him shine. This could mean a couple of different things. Perhaps he ultimately asked them to come with him as he comes out to his parents. Perhaps after he tells his parents, he confirms to them that it went well and in the process let\u2019s Jonah know the truth. <i>OR perhaps TJ shows up at the end of the episode with the bread, after Cyrus has come out to his parents, and this is Buffy and Andi finally putting the pieces together</i>. I don\u2019t know. But they definitely look proud and happy for someone here. The look they give each other is almost suspicious, and the fact that Buffy appears to be biting her lip, and Andi\u2019s face almost conveys a very particular vibe is&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;something.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"523\" data-orig-width=\"998\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9649157ac380c232971937397b7242a7/tumblr_inline_pmbncd5boH1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"523\" data-orig-width=\"998\"/></figure><p>This is of course the frame of the promo that most people seem to be focused on. Yes, it is clearly a split screen - meaning that the two images have been taken from separate scenes and stitched together for the sake of the promo. I haven\u2019t really focused on Jonah for this analysis, mainly because I have absolutely no idea how he and his panic attack are actually going to be tied into the episode. The one thing I find interesting about this moment is that it almost appears as if TJ is entering a room for the first time, so this may be the first moment we see him on screen. Like I mentioned above, I think there is a good chance that we could see him show up towards the end of the episode after Cyus comes out to his parents. I don\u2019t know if Cyrus will tell TJ about what happened or not, but I could definitely see a scenario in which TJ brings bread and goes to hug Cyrus (because that is what one does when someone they care about has lost a family member) and then Buffy and Andi witness it and put the pieces of the crush together. But who knows! Like I said, the end of this is mostly personal predictions as opposed to actual analysis.\u00a0</p>",

Here we see Cyrus explaining the meaning of a Shiva to Jonah, Andi, and Buffy. I would predict this is towards the beginning of the episode, similar to how the Bar Mitzvah episode got most of the Jewish traditions and conversations out of the way before the theme song so that the rest of the episode can focus more on the plot. This also implies that Jonah, Andi, and Buffy either arrive to the house together, or at least closely enough so that Cyrus only has to explain these details to his friends once. It also implies that TJ does not arrive at the same time as the others, and that he won\u2019t appear until later in the episode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"522\" data-orig-width=\"996\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d34c053fb0a22879ddbba43e4b72efa9/tumblr_inline_pmblc5nD8v1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"522\" data-orig-width=\"996\"></figure><p>2. Next we see Buffy\u2019s phone vibrate, which offends/disturbs the other guests at the Shiva. Andi looks immediately uncomfortable. I am guessing this won\u2019t be the first time her phone has gone off in the episode. It has probably already happened a couple of times, but Andi hadn\u2019t said anything up until this point. This is the event that pushes Andi and Buffy outside, where they will talk to Cyrus.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1040\" data-orig-width=\"990\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fd70e4061adf2ff6f360c1efae30877/tumblr_inline_pmblinfaHP1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1040\" data-orig-width=\"990\"></figure><p>3. Andi follows Buffy outside to confront her about who keeps trying to contact her, and Buffy walks away most likely to deal with it. I\u2019m not really gonna speculate on who it is in this post because it\u2019s not entirely relevant at the moment. What\u2019s important for this analysis are the physical shots we see here. This shows us that the green fencing and lawn furniture we see behind Buffy, is directly across from the windows and door to the house which we see behind Andi.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"993\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebca2daa70783602eee00cf4606961c1/tumblr_inline_pmblohqJW51rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"993\"></figure><p>4. We can tell from this frame that Buffy and Andi were not alone in the back yard, but likely Cyrus was with them. There are three glasses and an empty chair sitting across from Buffy and Andi, which tells us that at some point, probably shortly after Buffy walks away to deal with her mysterious phone friend, the Good Hair Crew sits down to talk together. No idea where Jonah is during all of this but I guess that\u2019s not entirely relevant either.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1049\" data-orig-width=\"994\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cb84a955d68d6059c3fb80f0b5ea544/tumblr_inline_pmblryPa631rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1049\" data-orig-width=\"994\"></figure><p>5. So now we have these two shots, which show Cyrus (note the windows) sitting across from Buffy and Andi (note the green fence). It\u2019s clear they are talking about something serious, given the look on Cyrus\u2019 face. We can assume that the conversation has shifted from who Buffy is texting, to Cyrus wanting to come out (most likely to his parents). I\u2019m not really predicting how this conversation starts or what triggers this decision, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. Cyrus wants to tell somebody the truth about his sexuality, and Andi responds with\u00a0\u201cIt is your choice who you tell, and when\u201d.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"994\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c1ca809f238f311b3ee1dfa9deb0082/tumblr_inline_pmblwfRmea1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"519\" data-orig-width=\"994\"></figure><p>6. In this frame, what we are most likely looking at is Buffy and Andi watching Cyrus as he walks back into the house to find his parents and tell them the truth. They may have stood up from their seats at the same time as Cyrus, and hugged him or showed some other sign of physical support before he turned to go inside. Buffy seems to be holding back some kind of emotion, almost like she\u2019s holding her breath to appear strong. Andi lets out a deep breath and smiles. They both have almost motherly looks that convey a sense of pride as they watch him go to speak his truth.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1044\" data-orig-width=\"992\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4921b0a8fd108e8be58e46d8a231d06/tumblr_inline_pmbm1uhFlV1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1044\" data-orig-width=\"992\"></figure><p>7. Now that Cyrus is back inside and out of sight, Buffy and Andi sit back down. The frame with the orange juice from above is also from this moment. At first, both Buffy and Andi are still smiling as they sit down. Andi is staring at the door, smiling. Buffy almost appears to let out a sigh of relief now that Cyrus can\u2019t see her. They are still focused on Cyrus, up until Buffy\u2019s phone vibrates again which leads Andi to ask if she\u2019s going to tell her. This shifts the focus back onto other drama/storylines and to one that is possibly lighter than the one with Cyrus which we have seen before on the show as a balancing tool.</p><p>And here is where things become a little less clear and venture more into personal theory rather than analysis\u2026 I am not sure if we will actually witness Cyrus coming out to his parents on screen or not. One theory I\u2019ve had is that he will decide to tell his parents, which will happen off-screen, and then he will return to his friends and confirm to them that it went well, and in doing so possibly reveal to Jonah and/or TJ that he came out to his parents, which would allow them to know that he\u2019s gay without having it feel repetitive. I could still see this as a likely possibility, but the promo doesn\u2019t really provide much insight either way (which is for the best - as we still want some surprises).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1046\" data-orig-width=\"991\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/11f18865ae489fdadff541e5165bf7e9/tumblr_inline_pmbmfiaZrw1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1046\" data-orig-width=\"991\"></figure><p>8. These two shots appear to be connected, although the framing of the background is a little off. I predict that these are the moments that actually have to do with him coming out. In the first clip, he is nodding at someone and it almost conveys a feeling of confirmation. Like he either just said something (\u201dI\u2019m gay\u201d) and is nodding to convince himself that he said it out loud, OR the person who he\u2019s talking to asked for confirmation (\u201dAre you telling us you\u2019re gay?\u201d or \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re-\u201d) towards what he was trying to tell them. I\u2019m not actually trying to speculate what the conversation will entail, but more so the messages being conveyed by his facial expressions and body language.</p><p>The second frame is a confident smile. Like a weight has been lifted off of him, or like he is pleased with the reaction to the conversation he is having. He looks like he is <i>proud</i>.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1045\" data-orig-width=\"988\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f03256bec83212d29e5cd679e030ef31/tumblr_inline_pmbn367ed91rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1045\" data-orig-width=\"988\"></figure><p>9. Although it\u2019s not made clear by the promo, I think it\u2019s safe to assume this moment between Buffy and Andi is a reaction related to Cyrus\u2019 coming out. The fact that they look at each other, and then look <i>at </i>whatever is going on almost makes it seem like they are staying back and watching him shine. This could mean a couple of different things. Perhaps he ultimately asked them to come with him as he comes out to his parents.

It also implies that TJ does not arrive at the same time as the others, and that he won&rsquo;t appear until later in the episode.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d34c053fb0a22879ddbba43e4b72efa9/tumblr_inline_pmblc5nD8v1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>2. Next we see Buffy&rsquo;s phone vibrate, which offends/disturbs the other guests at the Shiva. Andi looks immediately uncomfortable. I am guessing this won&rsquo;t be the first time her phone has gone off in the episode. It has probably already happened a couple of times, but Andi hadn&rsquo;t said anything up until this point. This is the event that pushes Andi and Buffy outside, where they will talk to Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7fd70e4061adf2ff6f360c1efae30877/tumblr_inline_pmblinfaHP1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>3. Andi follows Buffy outside to confront her about who keeps trying to contact her, and Buffy walks away most likely to deal with it. I&rsquo;m not really gonna speculate on who it is in this post because it&rsquo;s not entirely relevant at the moment. What&rsquo;s important for this analysis are the physical shots we see here. This shows us that the green fencing and lawn furniture we see behind Buffy, is directly across from the windows and door to the house which we see behind Andi.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ebca2daa70783602eee00cf4606961c1/tumblr_inline_pmblohqJW51rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>4. We can tell from this frame that Buffy and Andi were not alone in the back yard, but likely Cyrus was with them. There are three glasses and an empty chair sitting across from Buffy and Andi, which tells us that at some point, probably shortly after Buffy walks away to deal with her mysterious phone friend, the Good Hair Crew sits down to talk together. No idea where Jonah is during all of this but I guess that&rsquo;s not entirely relevant either.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7cb84a955d68d6059c3fb80f0b5ea544/tumblr_inline_pmblryPa631rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>5. So now we have these two shots, which show Cyrus (note the windows) sitting across from Buffy and Andi (note the green fence). It&rsquo;s clear they are talking about something serious, given the look on Cyrus&rsquo; face. We can assume that the conversation has shifted from who Buffy is texting, to Cyrus wanting to come out (most likely to his parents). I&rsquo;m not really predicting how this conversation starts or what triggers this decision, but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening here. Cyrus wants to tell somebody the truth about his sexuality, and Andi responds with&nbsp;&ldquo;It is your choice who you tell, and when&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c1ca809f238f311b3ee1dfa9deb0082/tumblr_inline_pmblwfRmea1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>6. In this frame, what we are most likely looking at is Buffy and Andi watching Cyrus as he walks back into the house to find his parents and tell them the truth. They may have stood up from their seats at the same time as Cyrus, and hugged him or showed some other sign of physical support before he turned to go inside. Buffy seems to be holding back some kind of emotion, almost like she&rsquo;s holding her breath to appear strong. Andi lets out a deep breath and smiles. They both have almost motherly looks that convey a sense of pride as they watch him go to speak his truth.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4921b0a8fd108e8be58e46d8a231d06/tumblr_inline_pmbm1uhFlV1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>7. Now that Cyrus is back inside and out of sight, Buffy and Andi sit back down. The frame with the orange juice from above is also from this moment. At first, both Buffy and Andi are still smiling as they sit down. Andi is staring at the door, smiling. Buffy almost appears to let out a sigh of relief now that Cyrus can&rsquo;t see her. They are still focused on Cyrus, up until Buffy&rsquo;s phone vibrates again which leads Andi to ask if she&rsquo;s going to tell her. This shifts the focus back onto other drama/storylines and to one that is possibly lighter than the one with Cyrus which we have seen before on the show as a balancing tool.</p><p>And here is where things become a little less clear and venture more into personal theory rather than analysis&hellip; I am not sure if we will actually witness Cyrus coming out to his parents on screen or not. One theory I&rsquo;ve had is that he will decide to tell his parents, which will happen off-screen, and then he will return to his friends and confirm to them that it went well, and in doing so possibly reveal to Jonah and/or TJ that he came out to his parents, which would allow them to know that he&rsquo;s gay without having it feel repetitive. I could still see this as a likely possibility, but the promo doesn&rsquo;t really provide much insight either way (which is for the best - as we still want some surprises).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/11f18865ae489fdadff541e5165bf7e9/tumblr_inline_pmbmfiaZrw1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>8. These two shots appear to be connected, although the framing of the background is a little off. I predict that these are the moments that actually have to do with him coming out. In the first clip, he is nodding at someone and it almost conveys a feeling of confirmation. Like he either just said something (&rdquo;I&rsquo;m gay&rdquo;) and is nodding to convince himself that he said it out loud, OR the person who he&rsquo;s talking to asked for confirmation (&rdquo;Are you telling us you&rsquo;re gay?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Does that mean you&rsquo;re-&rdquo;) towards what he was trying to tell them. I&rsquo;m not actually trying to speculate what the conversation will entail, but more so the messages being conveyed by his facial expressions and body language.</p><p>The second frame is a confident smile. Like a weight has been lifted off of him, or like he is pleased with the reaction to the conversation he is having. He looks like he is <i>proud</i>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f03256bec83212d29e5cd679e030ef31/tumblr_inline_pmbn367ed91rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>9. Although it&rsquo;s not made clear by the promo, I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume this moment between Buffy and Andi is a reaction related to Cyrus&rsquo; coming out. The fact that they look at each other, and then look <i>at </i>whatever is going on almost makes it seem like they are staying back and watching him shine. This could mean a couple of different things. Perhaps he ultimately asked them to come with him as he comes out to his parents. Perhaps after he tells his parents, he confirms to them that it went well and in the process let&rsquo;s Jonah know the truth. <i>OR perhaps TJ shows up at the end of the episode with the bread, after Cyrus has come out to his parents, and this is Buffy and Andi finally putting the pieces together</i>. I don&rsquo;t know. But they definitely look proud and happy for someone here. The look they give each other is almost suspicious, and the fact that Buffy appears to be biting her lip, and Andi&rsquo;s face almost conveys a very particular vibe is&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;something.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9649157ac380c232971937397b7242a7/tumblr_inline_pmbncd5boH1rrw3kz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is of course the frame of the promo that most people seem to be focused on. Yes, it is clearly a split screen - meaning that the two images have been taken from separate scenes and stitched together for the sake of the promo. I haven&rsquo;t really focused on Jonah for this analysis, mainly because I have absolutely no idea how he and his panic attack are actually going to be tied into the episode. The one thing I find interesting about this moment is that it almost appears as if TJ is entering a room for the first time, so this may be the first moment we see him on screen. Like I mentioned above, I think there is a good chance that we could see him show up towards the end of the episode after Cyus comes out to his parents. I don&rsquo;t know if Cyrus will tell TJ about what happened or not, but I could definitely see a scenario in which TJ brings bread and goes to hug Cyrus (because that is what one does when someone they care about has lost a family member) and then Buffy and Andi witness it and put the pieces of the crush together. But who knows! Like I said, the end of this is mostly personal predictions as opposed to actual analysis.&nbsp;</p></p>",
