        "body": "<p>There he stood. Petrified. It wasn\u2019t like this was not warranted. Marriage itself is a very stressful thing. All the time, effort, funds, everything is on the line for this one day. If one piece is off, it all comes crashing down. Everything has been building up to this. Will she say \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d? Will she run out? Will HE run out? He can never tell.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cYou aight, hombre?\u201d He heard a voice call out, a familiar voice from a fennec fox. Fenneko, standing as a minister. The fact Haida had to bear witness to such a thing is nightmare inducing. \u201cUm, yeah. Just&hellip;kinda nervous, I guess.\u201d \u201cAh, I don\u2019t blame ya. It\u2019s a nerve-wracking day.\u201d She replied. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, dude. You\u2019ve known her long enough to know she would never stand you up.\u201d He looked around, in contemplation, before responding. \u201c&hellip;yeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Suddenly, everyone looked towards the end of the aisle, and stood up. \u201cHere she comes, look alive.\u201d The small minister told the hyena, as their sights turned towards&hellip;her. Retsuko. She began slowly making her way down, in a dress that helps make her shine even more than her natural beauty already emitted. Her head is tilted down, but even still, he could see a smile coming from her, with such a warmth to it. With his ears, he could hear the organs playing Here Comes the Bride. But in his mind, he was hearing all sorts of music playing at just the mere sight of her. Kiss From a Rose, Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love, I\u2019ll Make Love to You, Your Smiling Face, 214, I Don\u2019t Mind, all the sappiest love songs he could think of, just playing all at once. He was in a state of shock, and euphoria. He was in love.</p><p>Haida took her hand, as she stood in front of him, with a wonderful combination of glowing eyes, and a bright smile. \u201cHi, sweetheart.\u201d Said Retsuko, in the sweetest, most loving voice he ever heard. \u201cHi, Retsy&hellip;you look wonderful.\u201d His words were only responded to by a bashful laugh, and a blush on her precious face. \u201cOh, stop, you look way better than me!\u201d She exclaimed, causing Haida\u2019s face to turn similarly red. \u201cAHEM! Shall we get started?\u201d Said Fenneko, casually looking at the engaged couple. Retsuko could only look in shock, at her dear friend as the one to wed them&hellip;but they both nodded.</p><p>And then, the fennec spoke.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved! We are gathered here on this most joyous of occasions, to celebrate the union of Retsuko\u2026.um&hellip;yes, and Haida\u2026&hellip;ya know, I never bothered to actually ask what the hell your last names were. Bah, who cares. Ya know, for all these years knowing these two, I knew, deep down, two very important things. One, they wouldn\u2019t be anything without me.\u201d That got a massive amount of laughter from the audience. \u201cI mean, I ain\u2019t joking, but alright. But two&hellip;that no matter what obstacles stood in their way, other people, life events, themselves&hellip;they were tailored made for each other. I ain\u2019t a strong believer in destiny, to me, it\u2019s just a cheap way to justify even the most mundane things in life. But if someone told me it was destined that they would be together as they have been&hellip;not gonna lie, I\u2019d buy it. There is something deep within them that, I think, pulls them through. Maybe it\u2019s their own hearts&hellip;maybe it\u2019s their kid, I dunno. But somehow, someway, they managed to persevere throughout many of the hard times. Of course, those are not over yet. They probably still have quite a bit to go through. But hopefully, with a love like theirs, we probably won\u2019t have to worry in the slightest about that. As long as that love stays strong, things will turn out just fine. But hell, you guys are probably getting sick and tired by me rambling on about them, let\u2019s hear what they have to say! You two like to get your vows out of the way?\u201d</p><p>Retsuko cleared her throat a little. \u201cI-I\u2019ll start, if that\u2019s okay with you,\u201d she said to her groom. \u201cOf course! Go right on ahead.\u201d The reassuring tone from Haida comforted her considerably, as she began her vow. \u201cHaida, I remember it was just a couple of years ago, I didn\u2019t really know you too much, and I wanted to get married, and have kids, so I didn\u2019t have to work another day in my life&hellip;well, two out of three ain\u2019t bad.\u201d She joked, resulting in more laughter from everyone. \u201cJump ahead a few years, and now I am still working at my job, yes, but I am also a mother to an absolutely wonderful baby boy, and will very soon become the wife of the most amazing man I\u2019ve ever met in my life. Ever since I\u2019ve really gotten to know you, it feels like every day has something new about it, it\u2019s like a brand new adventure every single time. The fact that you and Ikari are always by my side during it all really does mean a lot to me. I say this with no stretch whatsoever, you really changed my life in all the best of ways, Haida, and I cannot thank you enough for that. I vow to be a loving, and faithful wife, to be by your side whenever you need me, and to help make sure our son has a bright future ahead. I love you so much, I can\u2019t wait to become your wife, and&hellip;sorry it took so long for us to even start a relationship in the first place.\u201d The vow ended with her laughing very bashfully.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;my turn?,\u201d asked Haida, which solicited a \u201cyes, dum-dum\u201d from Fenneko. \u201cOh! Alright&hellip;well, firstly, don\u2019t feel too bad, took me forever to get you a ring, so I think that makes us even,\u201d he said with a smirk, causing Retsuko to laugh. \u201cSecondly&hellip;I didn\u2019t really think about it until a few days ago, but under most circumstances, this probably wouldn\u2019t ever happen. I wasn\u2019t exactly the most&hellip;stable dude. My crush on you all those years ago kinda put me in a few rough spots, I won\u2019t lie. In most cases, I probably would\u2019ve found, if we were ever a thing, that we didn\u2019t work out in the slightest, and that I wasted so much time. But that didn\u2019t happen. The moment you and I began going out, I felt&hellip;better about myself. More selfless, cheerier, more energetic, more focused. I can\u2019t recall the last time I went into work with my chest clenching up, or my brain going all over the place! You managed to take a broken wreck like me, and fix me until I was a new man. I often wish I could repay you in any possible way, and kick myself for not being good enough&hellip;but you never seem to mind, and you don\u2019t know how grateful I am for that. Taking care of Ikari with you has been one of the greatest honors I\u2019ve ever had put upon me, and will probably continue to be that way for a long time. I cannot promise I will be the best husband in the world. I\u2019m hardly the best boyfriend. But if it means I get to start every day with your incredible smile, and our pride and joy bringing us all the happiness in the world, I\u2019m willing to do the best I possibly can. I vow to be a caring, and loving husband, to never turn my back on you, and to be there whenever you need me. I love you with all my heart, Retsuko, and I cannot wait for what awaits us.\u201d</p><p>By the time both were done, their eyes were wet with tears, as both look at each other with the biggest smiles possible. \u201c&hellip;guys, c\u2019mon. You\u2019re at an event, no need to get emotional,\u201d said Fenneko, causing the two to laugh out out, before continuing. \u201cWell, in any case, let\u2019s get those rings on ya!\u201d As they put the rings on their fingers (courtesy of the ring-bearer&hellip;Ikari), it really does start to sink in&hellip;this is happening. They are actually going to get married. And now&hellip;the moment everyone knew was coming. \u201cDo you, Retsuko, take this lumbering oaf, I mean, Haida, to be your lawfully wedded husband, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?\u201d \u201c&hellip;.I do,\u201d said Retsuko, with a small sense of joy upon saying those words. \u201cAnd do you, Haida, take this death metal singing freak, I mean, Retsuko, to be your lawfully wedded wife, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? \u2026.and even then, knowing you, you would desperately try not to part with her upon death?,\u201d Fenneko joked. \u201cI do,\u201d said Haida, rather warmly.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, by the power invested in me, and put upon my two closest friends, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride\u2026.kiss her, ya idiot.\u201d</p><p>Haida very gently lifted Retsuko\u2019s veil before being jumped by the red panda, who proceeded to give him the biggest kiss she could possibly give. He wrapped his arms, and returned the smooch, all while a roaring applause calls out to them. Not that it mattered to them. As far as they were concerned, they were together, in their own little world of love. As soon as the kiss broke, they could only stare into each others\u2019 eyes, tears streaming down, and just laugh. \u201cWe did it!,\u201d exclaimed Retsuko, repeating that phrase until Haida began joining her, nuzzling his face up to hers. He picked her up bridal style, and began walking up the aisle, outside the doors, to a bunch of cherry blossom trees. \u201cAh&hellip;it\u2019s really beautiful out here, huh?,\u201d asked Retsuko. \u201cIt sure is&hellip;but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to yo-\u201c \u201cRetsuko! Haida! Wait!\u201d The two turn, and see Tsunoda and Fenneko run up to them. \u201cW-what\u2019s wrong?,\u201d asked Haida. \u201cWell, firstly, ya gotta throw the bouquet, Retsy. That\u2019s kind of a thing in weddings.\u201d \u201cOh, okay!\u201d Retsuko responded to Fenneko\u2019s request by simply dropping the bouquet into the fennec fox\u2019s arms. \u201cThere! Now you and Tsunoda can get married!\u201d Tsunoda laughed at the gesture, while Fenneko just looked at them, unamused. \u201c&hellip;ha. Funny. Secondly, we kinda forgot to get a wedding photo of you guys, so we need to do that quickly. We figured you guys would want Ikari, but since he refuses to let go of the ring pillow, I\u2019m gonna have to ask that you guys take off your rings, and put them on the pillow when we get it set up, so it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s just grabbing a pillow for no reason.\u201d \u201cOh. Sure!,\u201d said Haida. </p><p>The four quickly look around, before finding a view of the lake, with cherry blossoms blowing around, a bunch of petals already on the floor. \u201cPerfect!,\u201d Tsunoda exclaimed, running over, and picking up Ikari, to put him in front of his parents, clinging tight to the pillow. The couple quickly handed the rings to Fenneko, who put them nicely onto the pillow, while the child began crying, possibly from being overwhelmed. \u201cAh, great. Um&hellip;pacifier? Anything?\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s one in my pocket!,\u201d Haida revealed, grabbing one out, and handing it to Fenneko. She quickly plants it into the child\u2019s mouth, subduing him enough to get the photo. \u201cWe only got one shot, so let\u2019s make it count,\u201d the fennec fox said, as she stood back enough, phone camera at ready. \u201cYou guys good to go?\u201d The hyena and red panda looked at each other, love brightening up their faces tenfold. Suddenly, Retsuko draws her cheek up to Haida\u2019s. \u201cReady, Fenneko!\u201d</p><p>It was here, when Haida finally let it sit in. Retsuko was his wife now. The mere notion of that would\u2019ve sounded like some distant dream not too long ago. He often wondered what that day would look like, and here it was.</p><p>Was he sure this wasn\u2019t a dream? Surely an angel like Retsuko would never settle for a lowlife like Haida, right? That only seems reasonable.</p><p>But no. It was very much real.</p><p>It was real&hellip;</p><p>\u201cSmile!\u201d</p><p>*click*</p><p>&hellip;and it was perfect.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4201\" data-orig-width=\"4201\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f10f0c761b2533efe1821d66c85ffdbb/tumblr_inline_prp97bRSZC1uzj2w6_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"4201\" data-orig-width=\"4201\"/></figure><hr><p>So, I mentioned how stressful the whole final chapter would be, given I want to get it done before Season 2 premieres&hellip;then I magically wake up at 4 in the morning, and decide to write it out. Funny how that works, huh? Well, anyways, there is an epilogue left, but otherwise, this IS the last part of this story. I want to thank all of you for being so patient with me, a lot of stuff has happened since the beginning of writing this, to today. A lot of work, a lot of laziness, a lot of illness and most surprisingly, a lot of stress. Yeah, while writing this wasn\u2019t very stressful, events going on, either in my life, or in my social circles, kinda left me in various stages of stress. But, I think a large chunk of that is gonna die down now. Hopefully, anyway.</p><p>A GINORMOUS shout-out to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mottvf7sAOrYhxvsfwW1TDA\">@skeletonguys-and-ragdolls</a> for the wonderful picture you see. Diana, thank you so, so, SO much for helping to make this thing that much more special to me, and for being as patient as you were during this whole thing. I want to apologize again for taking so damn long.</p><p>So! Where to now? Answer&hellip;.well, firstly, get the epilogue done. That\u2019s kinda the main thing. But also! Considering Season 2 is coming out (and yes, I did catch a bit of the trailer on Netflix&hellip;I like to think it helped increase my stress a little bit. :P), that raises the question&hellip;.will the Ikariverse also include Season 2?????</p><p><i>Fuck no, I already had to kinda retcon things to get the Christmas special in there, you think I\u2019m gonna sneak in a whole season? Get outta here.</i></p><p>BUT! Chances are ELEMENTS of Season 2 will be in there. I know Retsuko\u2019s mom in the series will probably not appear, because&hellip;.well, I already wrote in Rie, and I\u2019m too lazy to change that. But other characters may still very much appear. We\u2019ll just have to see. Until that comes, I probably will just write shorter, sillier adventures. I still need to write Gori and Washimi meeting Ikari, I think&hellip;.actually, come to think of it, there\u2019s a lot of stuff I need to write. Should probably get on that. :/</p><p>Until then, guys, have yourselves a wonderful day!</p>",

He picked her up bridal style, and began walking up the aisle, outside the doors, to a bunch of cherry blossom trees. \u201cAh\u2026it\u2019s really beautiful out here, huh?,\u201d asked Retsuko. \u201cIt sure is\u2026but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to yo-\u201c \u201cRetsuko! Haida! Wait!\u201d The two turn, and see Tsunoda and Fenneko run up to them. \u201cW-what\u2019s wrong?,\u201d asked Haida. \u201cWell, firstly, ya gotta throw the bouquet, Retsy. That\u2019s kind of a thing in weddings.\u201d \u201cOh, okay!\u201d Retsuko responded to Fenneko\u2019s request by simply dropping the bouquet into the fennec fox\u2019s arms. \u201cThere! Now you and Tsunoda can get married!\u201d Tsunoda laughed at the gesture, while Fenneko just looked at them, unamused. \u201c\u2026ha. Funny. Secondly, we kinda forgot to get a wedding photo of you guys, so we need to do that quickly. We figured you guys would want Ikari, but since he refuses to let go of the ring pillow, I\u2019m gonna have to ask that you guys take off your rings, and put them on the pillow when we get it set up, so it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s just grabbing a pillow for no reason.\u201d \u201cOh. Sure!,\u201d said Haida. </p><p>The four quickly look around, before finding a view of the lake, with cherry blossoms blowing around, a bunch of petals already on the floor. \u201cPerfect!,\u201d Tsunoda exclaimed, running over, and picking up Ikari, to put him in front of his parents, clinging tight to the pillow. The couple quickly handed the rings to Fenneko, who put them nicely onto the pillow, while the child began crying, possibly from being overwhelmed. \u201cAh, great. Um\u2026pacifier? Anything?\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s one in my pocket!,\u201d Haida revealed, grabbing one out, and handing it to Fenneko. She quickly plants it into the child\u2019s mouth, subduing him enough to get the photo. \u201cWe only got one shot, so let\u2019s make it count,\u201d the fennec fox said, as she stood back enough, phone camera at ready. \u201cYou guys good to go?\u201d The hyena and red panda looked at each other, love brightening up their faces tenfold. Suddenly, Retsuko draws her cheek up to Haida\u2019s. \u201cReady, Fenneko!\u201d</p><p>It was here, when Haida finally let it sit in. Retsuko was his wife now. The mere notion of that would\u2019ve sounded like some distant dream not too long ago. He often wondered what that day would look like, and here it was.</p><p>Was he sure this wasn\u2019t a dream?

I know Retsuko\u2019s mom in the series will probably not appear, because\u2026.well, I already wrote in Rie, and I\u2019m too lazy to change that. But other characters may still very much appear. We\u2019ll just have to see. Until that comes, I probably will just write shorter, sillier adventures. I still need to write Gori and Washimi meeting Ikari, I think\u2026.actually, come to think of it, there\u2019s a lot of stuff I need to write. Should probably get on that. :/</p><p>Until then, guys, have yourselves a wonderful day!</p>",

All the time, effort, funds, everything is on the line for this one day. If one piece is off, it all comes crashing down. Everything has been building up to this. Will she say \u201cI don\u2019t\u201d? Will she run out? Will HE run out? He can never tell.<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cYou aight, hombre?\u201d He heard a voice call out, a familiar voice from a fennec fox. Fenneko, standing as a minister. The fact Haida had to bear witness to such a thing is nightmare inducing. \u201cUm, yeah. Just\u2026kinda nervous, I guess.\u201d \u201cAh, I don\u2019t blame ya. It\u2019s a nerve-wracking day.\u201d She replied. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, dude. You\u2019ve known her long enough to know she would never stand you up.\u201d He looked around, in contemplation, before responding. \u201c\u2026yeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Suddenly, everyone looked towards the end of the aisle, and stood up. \u201cHere she comes, look alive.\u201d The small minister told the hyena, as their sights turned towards\u2026her. Retsuko. She began slowly making her way down, in a dress that helps make her shine even more than her natural beauty already emitted. Her head is tilted down, but even still, he could see a smile coming from her, with such a warmth to it. With his ears, he could hear the organs playing Here Comes the Bride. But in his mind, he was hearing all sorts of music playing at just the mere sight of her. Kiss From a Rose, Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love, I\u2019ll Make Love to You, Your Smiling Face, 214, I Don\u2019t Mind, all the sappiest love songs he could think of, just playing all at once. He was in a state of shock, and euphoria. He was in love.</p><p>Haida took her hand, as she stood in front of him, with a wonderful combination of glowing eyes, and a bright smile. \u201cHi, sweetheart.\u201d Said Retsuko, in the sweetest, most loving voice he ever heard. \u201cHi, Retsy\u2026you look wonderful.\u201d His words were only responded to by a bashful laugh, and a blush on her precious face. \u201cOh, stop, you look way better than me!\u201d She exclaimed, causing Haida\u2019s face to turn similarly red. \u201cAHEM! Shall we get started?\u201d Said Fenneko, casually looking at the engaged couple. Retsuko could only look in shock, at her dear friend as the one to wed them\u2026but they both nodded.</p><p>And then, the fennec spoke.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved! We are gathered here on this most joyous of occasions, to celebrate the union of Retsuko\u2026.um\u2026yes, and Haida\u2026\u2026ya know, I never bothered to actually ask what the hell your last names were. Bah, who cares. Ya know, for all these years knowing these two, I knew, deep down, two very important things. One, they wouldn\u2019t be anything without me.\u201d That got a massive amount of laughter from the audience. \u201cI mean, I ain\u2019t joking, but alright. But two\u2026that no matter what obstacles stood in their way, other people, life events, themselves\u2026they were tailored made for each other. I ain\u2019t a strong believer in destiny, to me, it\u2019s just a cheap way to justify even the most mundane things in life. But if someone told me it was destined that they would be together as they have been\u2026not gonna lie, I\u2019d buy it. There is something deep within them that, I think, pulls them through. Maybe it\u2019s their own hearts\u2026maybe it\u2019s their kid, I dunno. But somehow, someway, they managed to persevere throughout many of the hard times. Of course, those are not over yet. They probably still have quite a bit to go through. But hopefully, with a love like theirs, we probably won\u2019t have to worry in the slightest about that. As long as that love stays strong, things will turn out just fine. But hell, you guys are probably getting sick and tired by me rambling on about them, let\u2019s hear what they have to say! You two like to get your vows out of the way?\u201d</p><p>Retsuko cleared her throat a little. \u201cI-I\u2019ll start, if that\u2019s okay with you,\u201d she said to her groom. \u201cOf course! Go right on ahead.\u201d The reassuring tone from Haida comforted her considerably, as she began her vow. \u201cHaida, I remember it was just a couple of years ago, I didn\u2019t really know you too much, and I wanted to get married, and have kids, so I didn\u2019t have to work another day in my life\u2026well, two out of three ain\u2019t bad.\u201d She joked, resulting in more laughter from everyone. \u201cJump ahead a few years, and now I am still working at my job, yes, but I am also a mother to an absolutely wonderful baby boy, and will very soon become the wife of the most amazing man I\u2019ve ever met in my life. Ever since I\u2019ve really gotten to know you, it feels like every day has something new about it, it\u2019s like a brand new adventure every single time. The fact that you and Ikari are always by my side during it all really does mean a lot to me. I say this with no stretch whatsoever, you really changed my life in all the best of ways, Haida, and I cannot thank you enough for that. I vow to be a loving, and faithful wife, to be by your side whenever you need me, and to help make sure our son has a bright future ahead. I love you so much, I can\u2019t wait to become your wife, and\u2026sorry it took so long for us to even start a relationship in the first place.\u201d The vow ended with her laughing very bashfully.</p><p>\u201c\u2026my turn?,\u201d asked Haida, which solicited a \u201cyes, dum-dum\u201d from Fenneko. \u201cOh! Alright\u2026well, firstly, don\u2019t feel too bad, took me forever to get you a ring, so I think that makes us even,\u201d he said with a smirk, causing Retsuko to laugh. \u201cSecondly\u2026I didn\u2019t really think about it until a few days ago, but under most circumstances, this probably wouldn\u2019t ever happen. I wasn\u2019t exactly the most\u2026stable dude. My crush on you all those years ago kinda put me in a few rough spots, I won\u2019t lie. In most cases, I probably would\u2019ve found, if we were ever a thing, that we didn\u2019t work out in the slightest, and that I wasted so much time. But that didn\u2019t happen. The moment you and I began going out, I felt\u2026better about myself. More selfless, cheerier, more energetic, more focused. I can\u2019t recall the last time I went into work with my chest clenching up, or my brain going all over the place! You managed to take a broken wreck like me, and fix me until I was a new man. I often wish I could repay you in any possible way, and kick myself for not being good enough\u2026but you never seem to mind, and you don\u2019t know how grateful I am for that. Taking care of Ikari with you has been one of the greatest honors I\u2019ve ever had put upon me, and will probably continue to be that way for a long time. I cannot promise I will be the best husband in the world. I\u2019m hardly the best boyfriend. But if it means I get to start every day with your incredible smile, and our pride and joy bringing us all the happiness in the world, I\u2019m willing to do the best I possibly can. I vow to be a caring, and loving husband, to never turn my back on you, and to be there whenever you need me. I love you with all my heart, Retsuko, and I cannot wait for what awaits us.\u201d</p><p>By the time both were done, their eyes were wet with tears, as both look at each other with the biggest smiles possible. \u201c\u2026guys, c\u2019mon. You\u2019re at an event, no need to get emotional,\u201d said Fenneko, causing the two to laugh out out, before continuing. \u201cWell, in any case, let\u2019s get those rings on ya!\u201d As they put the rings on their fingers (courtesy of the ring-bearer\u2026Ikari), it really does start to sink in\u2026this is happening. They are actually going to get married. And now\u2026the moment everyone knew was coming. \u201cDo you, Retsuko, take this lumbering oaf, I mean, Haida, to be your lawfully wedded husband, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?\u201d \u201c\u2026.I do,\u201d said Retsuko, with a small sense of joy upon saying those words. \u201cAnd do you, Haida, take this death metal singing freak, I mean, Retsuko, to be your lawfully wedded wife, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? \u2026.and even then, knowing you, you would desperately try not to part with her upon death?,\u201d Fenneko joked. \u201cI do,\u201d said Haida, rather warmly.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, by the power invested in me, and put upon my two closest friends, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride\u2026.kiss her, ya idiot.\u201d</p><p>Haida very gently lifted Retsuko\u2019s veil before being jumped by the red panda, who proceeded to give him the biggest kiss she could possibly give. He wrapped his arms, and returned the smooch, all while a roaring applause calls out to them. Not that it mattered to them. As far as they were concerned, they were together, in their own little world of love. As soon as the kiss broke, they could only stare into each others\u2019 eyes, tears streaming down, and just laugh. \u201cWe did it!,\u201d exclaimed Retsuko, repeating that phrase until Haida began joining her, nuzzling his face up to hers. He picked her up bridal style, and began walking up the aisle, outside the doors, to a bunch of cherry blossom trees. \u201cAh\u2026it\u2019s really beautiful out here, huh?,\u201d asked Retsuko. \u201cIt sure is\u2026but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to yo-\u201c \u201cRetsuko! Haida! Wait!\u201d The two turn, and see Tsunoda and Fenneko run up to them. \u201cW-what\u2019s wrong?,\u201d asked Haida. \u201cWell, firstly, ya gotta throw the bouquet, Retsy. That\u2019s kind of a thing in weddings.\u201d \u201cOh, okay!\u201d Retsuko responded to Fenneko\u2019s request by simply dropping the bouquet into the fennec fox\u2019s arms. \u201cThere! Now you and Tsunoda can get married!\u201d Tsunoda laughed at the gesture, while Fenneko just looked at them, unamused. \u201c\u2026ha. Funny.

The couple quickly handed the rings to Fenneko, who put them nicely onto the pillow, while the child began crying, possibly from being overwhelmed. \u201cAh, great. Um\u2026pacifier?

She quickly plants it into the child\u2019s mouth, subduing him enough to get the photo. \u201cWe only got one shot, so let\u2019s make it count,\u201d the fennec fox said, as she stood back enough, phone camera at ready. \u201cYou guys good to go?\u201d The hyena and red panda looked at each other, love brightening up their faces tenfold.

He was in a state of shock, and euphoria. He was in love.</p><p>Haida took her hand, as she stood in front of him, with a wonderful combination of glowing eyes, and a bright smile. &ldquo;Hi, sweetheart.&rdquo; Said Retsuko, in the sweetest, most loving voice he ever heard. &ldquo;Hi, Retsy&hellip;you look wonderful.&rdquo; His words were only responded to by a bashful laugh, and a blush on her precious face. &ldquo;Oh, stop, you look way better than me!&rdquo; She exclaimed, causing Haida&rsquo;s face to turn similarly red. &ldquo;AHEM! Shall we get started?&rdquo; Said Fenneko, casually looking at the engaged couple. Retsuko could only look in shock, at her dear friend as the one to wed them&hellip;but they both nodded.</p><p>And then, the fennec spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Dearly beloved! We are gathered here on this most joyous of occasions, to celebrate the union of Retsuko&hellip;.um&hellip;yes, and Haida&hellip;&hellip;ya know, I never bothered to actually ask what the hell your last names were. Bah, who cares. Ya know, for all these years knowing these two, I knew, deep down, two very important things. One, they wouldn&rsquo;t be anything without me.&rdquo; That got a massive amount of laughter from the audience. &ldquo;I mean, I ain&rsquo;t joking, but alright. But two&hellip;that no matter what obstacles stood in their way, other people, life events, themselves&hellip;they were tailored made for each other. I ain&rsquo;t a strong believer in destiny, to me, it&rsquo;s just a cheap way to justify even the most mundane things in life. But if someone told me it was destined that they would be together as they have been&hellip;not gonna lie, I&rsquo;d buy it. There is something deep within them that, I think, pulls them through. Maybe it&rsquo;s their own hearts&hellip;maybe it&rsquo;s their kid, I dunno. But somehow, someway, they managed to persevere throughout many of the hard times. Of course, those are not over yet. They probably still have quite a bit to go through. But hopefully, with a love like theirs, we probably won&rsquo;t have to worry in the slightest about that. As long as that love stays strong, things will turn out just fine. But hell, you guys are probably getting sick and tired by me rambling on about them, let&rsquo;s hear what they have to say! You two like to get your vows out of the way?&rdquo;</p><p>Retsuko cleared her throat a little. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll start, if that&rsquo;s okay with you,&rdquo; she said to her groom. &ldquo;Of course! Go right on ahead.&rdquo; The reassuring tone from Haida comforted her considerably, as she began her vow. &ldquo;Haida, I remember it was just a couple of years ago, I didn&rsquo;t really know you too much, and I wanted to get married, and have kids, so I didn&rsquo;t have to work another day in my life&hellip;well, two out of three ain&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo; She joked, resulting in more laughter from everyone. &ldquo;Jump ahead a few years, and now I am still working at my job, yes, but I am also a mother to an absolutely wonderful baby boy, and will very soon become the wife of the most amazing man I&rsquo;ve ever met in my life. Ever since I&rsquo;ve really gotten to know you, it feels like every day has something new about it, it&rsquo;s like a brand new adventure every single time. The fact that you and Ikari are always by my side during it all really does mean a lot to me. I say this with no stretch whatsoever, you really changed my life in all the best of ways, Haida, and I cannot thank you enough for that. I vow to be a loving, and faithful wife, to be by your side whenever you need me, and to help make sure our son has a bright future ahead. I love you so much, I can&rsquo;t wait to become your wife, and&hellip;sorry it took so long for us to even start a relationship in the first place.&rdquo; The vow ended with her laughing very bashfully.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;my turn?,&rdquo; asked Haida, which solicited a &ldquo;yes, dum-dum&rdquo; from Fenneko. &ldquo;Oh! Alright&hellip;well, firstly, don&rsquo;t feel too bad, took me forever to get you a ring, so I think that makes us even,&rdquo; he said with a smirk, causing Retsuko to laugh. &ldquo;Secondly&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t really think about it until a few days ago, but under most circumstances, this probably wouldn&rsquo;t ever happen. I wasn&rsquo;t exactly the most&hellip;stable dude. My crush on you all those years ago kinda put me in a few rough spots, I won&rsquo;t lie. In most cases, I probably would&rsquo;ve found, if we were ever a thing, that we didn&rsquo;t work out in the slightest, and that I wasted so much time. But that didn&rsquo;t happen. The moment you and I began going out, I felt&hellip;better about myself. More selfless, cheerier, more energetic, more focused. I can&rsquo;t recall the last time I went into work with my chest clenching up, or my brain going all over the place! You managed to take a broken wreck like me, and fix me until I was a new man. I often wish I could repay you in any possible way, and kick myself for not being good enough&hellip;but you never seem to mind, and you don&rsquo;t know how grateful I am for that. Taking care of Ikari with you has been one of the greatest honors I&rsquo;ve ever had put upon me, and will probably continue to be that way for a long time. I cannot promise I will be the best husband in the world. I&rsquo;m hardly the best boyfriend. But if it means I get to start every day with your incredible smile, and our pride and joy bringing us all the happiness in the world, I&rsquo;m willing to do the best I possibly can. I vow to be a caring, and loving husband, to never turn my back on you, and to be there whenever you need me. I love you with all my heart, Retsuko, and I cannot wait for what awaits us.&rdquo;</p><p>By the time both were done, their eyes were wet with tears, as both look at each other with the biggest smiles possible. &ldquo;&hellip;guys, c&rsquo;mon. You&rsquo;re at an event, no need to get emotional,&rdquo; said Fenneko, causing the two to laugh out out, before continuing. &ldquo;Well, in any case, let&rsquo;s get those rings on ya!&rdquo; As they put the rings on their fingers (courtesy of the ring-bearer&hellip;Ikari), it really does start to sink in&hellip;this is happening. They are actually going to get married. And now&hellip;the moment everyone knew was coming. &ldquo;Do you, Retsuko, take this lumbering oaf, I mean, Haida, to be your lawfully wedded husband, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;.I do,&rdquo; said Retsuko, with a small sense of joy upon saying those words. &ldquo;And do you, Haida, take this death metal singing freak, I mean, Retsuko, to be your lawfully wedded wife, through good times and bad, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? &hellip;.and even then, knowing you, you would desperately try not to part with her upon death?,&rdquo; Fenneko joked. &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Haida, rather warmly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, by the power invested in me, and put upon my two closest friends, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride&hellip;.kiss her, ya idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>Haida very gently lifted Retsuko&rsquo;s veil before being jumped by the red panda, who proceeded to give him the biggest kiss she could possibly give. He wrapped his arms, and returned the smooch, all while a roaring applause calls out to them. Not that it mattered to them. As far as they were concerned, they were together, in their own little world of love. As soon as the kiss broke, they could only stare into each others&rsquo; eyes, tears streaming down, and just laugh. &ldquo;We did it!,&rdquo; exclaimed Retsuko, repeating that phrase until Haida began joining her, nuzzling his face up to hers. He picked her up bridal style, and began walking up the aisle, outside the doors, to a bunch of cherry blossom trees. &ldquo;Ah&hellip;it&rsquo;s really beautiful out here, huh?,&rdquo; asked Retsuko. &ldquo;It sure is&hellip;but it doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to yo-&ldquo; &ldquo;Retsuko! Haida! Wait!&rdquo; The two turn, and see Tsunoda and Fenneko run up to them. &ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s wrong?,&rdquo; asked Haida. &ldquo;Well, firstly, ya gotta throw the bouquet, Retsy. That&rsquo;s kind of a thing in weddings.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, okay!&rdquo; Retsuko responded to Fenneko&rsquo;s request by simply dropping the bouquet into the fennec fox&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;There! Now you and Tsunoda can get married!&rdquo; Tsunoda laughed at the gesture, while Fenneko just looked at them, unamused. &ldquo;&hellip;ha. Funny. Secondly, we kinda forgot to get a wedding photo of you guys, so we need to do that quickly. We figured you guys would want Ikari, but since he refuses to let go of the ring pillow, I&rsquo;m gonna have to ask that you guys take off your rings, and put them on the pillow when we get it set up, so it doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s just grabbing a pillow for no reason.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh. Sure!,&rdquo; said Haida. </p><p>The four quickly look around, before finding a view of the lake, with cherry blossoms blowing around, a bunch of petals already on the floor. &ldquo;Perfect!,&rdquo; Tsunoda exclaimed, running over, and picking up Ikari, to put him in front of his parents, clinging tight to the pillow. The couple quickly handed the rings to Fenneko, who put them nicely onto the pillow, while the child began crying, possibly from being overwhelmed. &ldquo;Ah, great. Um&hellip;pacifier? Anything?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s one in my pocket!,&rdquo; Haida revealed, grabbing one out, and handing it to Fenneko. She quickly plants it into the child&rsquo;s mouth, subduing him enough to get the photo. &ldquo;We only got one shot, so let&rsquo;s make it count,&rdquo; the fennec fox said, as she stood back enough, phone camera at ready. &ldquo;You guys good to go?&rdquo; The hyena and red panda looked at each other, love brightening up their faces tenfold. Suddenly, Retsuko draws her cheek up to Haida&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Ready, Fenneko!&rdquo;</p><p>It was here, when Haida finally let it sit in. Retsuko was his wife now. The mere notion of that would&rsquo;ve sounded like some distant dream not too long ago. He often wondered what that day would look like, and here it was.</p><p>Was he sure this wasn&rsquo;t a dream? Surely an angel like Retsuko would never settle for a lowlife like Haida, right? That only seems reasonable.</p><p>But no. It was very much real.</p><p>It was real&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Smile!&rdquo;</p><p>*click*</p><p>&hellip;and it was perfect.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f10f0c761b2533efe1821d66c85ffdbb/tumblr_inline_prp97bRSZC1uzj2w6_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><hr /><p>So, I mentioned how stressful the whole final chapter would be, given I want to get it done before Season 2 premieres&hellip;then I magically wake up at 4 in the morning, and decide to write it out. Funny how that works, huh? Well, anyways, there is an epilogue left, but otherwise, this IS the last part of this story. I want to thank all of you for being so patient with me, a lot of stuff has happened since the beginning of writing this, to today. A lot of work, a lot of laziness, a lot of illness and most surprisingly, a lot of stress. Yeah, while writing this wasn&rsquo;t very stressful, events going on, either in my life, or in my social circles, kinda left me in various stages of stress. But, I think a large chunk of that is gonna die down now. Hopefully, anyway.</p><p>A GINORMOUS shout-out to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mottvf7sAOrYhxvsfwW1TDA\">@skeletonguys-and-ragdolls</a> for the wonderful picture you see. Diana, thank you so, so, SO much for helping to make this thing that much more special to me, and for being as patient as you were during this whole thing. I want to apologize again for taking so damn long.</p><p>So! Where to now? Answer&hellip;.well, firstly, get the epilogue done. That&rsquo;s kinda the main thing. But also! Considering Season 2 is coming out (and yes, I did catch a bit of the trailer on Netflix&hellip;I like to think it helped increase my stress a little bit. :P), that raises the question&hellip;.will the Ikariverse also include Season 2?????</p><p><i>Fuck no, I already had to kinda retcon things to get the Christmas special in there, you think I&rsquo;m gonna sneak in a whole season? Get outta here.</i></p><p>BUT! Chances are ELEMENTS of Season 2 will be in there. I know Retsuko&rsquo;s mom in the series will probably not appear, because&hellip;.well, I already wrote in Rie, and I&rsquo;m too lazy to change that. But other characters may still very much appear. We&rsquo;ll just have to see. Until that comes, I probably will just write shorter, sillier adventures. I still need to write Gori and Washimi meeting Ikari, I think&hellip;.actually, come to think of it, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff I need to write. Should probably get on that. :/</p><p>Until then, guys, have yourselves a wonderful day!</p>",

With the two parties, they\u2019re getting themselves dressed up*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *setting up her veil* \u2026.I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t look quite right. Looks a little crooked.</p><p><b>Tsunoda:</b> Oh, NOW you\u2019re worried about how good things look.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hey, it\u2019s different when it\u2019s on you!</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Honey, relax. You look great!</p><p><b>Hiroko: </b>Yeah! Chill a bit, my bro will love ya no matter what!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> \u2026.well, yeah. That part I know for certain.</p><p><b>Harumi:</b> So you shouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Yeah\u2026.heh.</p><p><b>Riko:</b> What\u2019s up?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I don\u2019t know. Just&hellip;something about Haida, and Ryuu&hellip;kinda makes me think about Ikari a little bit.</p><p><b>Hiroko:</b> &hellip;huh?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Er, nothing! I-I\u2019ll chat with Haida about it later.</p><p><b>Harumi:</b> Oh. Um, alright.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Yeah\u2026.um, what time is it?</p><p><b>Tsunoda:</b> *checks phone* It is-*GASP!* We need to get a move on! We don\u2019t have much time!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> UH, a-alright!</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Just put a little lipstick on, you look fine otherwise!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Uh, right! *gets lipstick on her mouth* &hellip;I wonder if Haida\u2019s stressing out as much.</p><p>*MEANWHILE!*</p><p><b>Haida: </b>*setting up his tie* &hellip;so, how do I look?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Oof, you SURE this guy\u2019s gonna be my brother-in-law, dad? *snickers*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> H-hey!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Ah, all in good fun!</p><p><b>Ookami:</b> Being real, you look about as good as a groom could probably look.</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> You look great, son\u2026*sniff*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Aw, dad, c\u2019mon, not now!</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> S-sorry! Just&hellip;oh, my son\u2019s about to get married, I feel like I need to shed a few tears!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Don\u2019t feel too bad, I\u2019m probably going to be crying a ton giving my baby girl away&hellip;er, happy tears, rest assured.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Heh, thanks.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> &hellip;er, listen, Haida. I know, I probably shouldn\u2019t be one to talk about this, given&hellip;well, some of the stuff I\u2019ve done, but&hellip;treat her well, okay? Treat her the way a good man treats his wife.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> O-of course, sir! I will try to make sure I treat your daughter with the utmost respect and dignity!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> *chuckles* I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll care so much for that, I think she just wants to be loved!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, I will love her until the end of time.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Wonderful.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;I, uh, I wish you two all the best&hellip;brother.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hehe, dude, you\u2019re still uncomfortable? I thought you warmed up!</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>It\u2019s all still a little much for me, I\u2019m just trying to take it all in.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Ah. Well, maybe some time soon, you and I can hang out again, do some more brother-in-law bonding, huh?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;alright. :)</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Awesome!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> *opens the door* Is the dum-dum ready to go, or do we need to wait another five hours?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Er, just about, Fenneko!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Alrighty. If you guys wanna go out to the lobby, I\u2019ll make sure Haida didn\u2019t forget anything. Spoilers, he probably did.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Very well.</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> *pats Haida on the back* See you out there, sport!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Thanks, dad! *they leave, with he and Fenneko the only ones there* So, did I miss anything?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Let\u2019s see&hellip;ah. *fixes his collar* There. Now you look something vaguely resembling presentable.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hahahaha. *Fenneko goes over to check on herself in the mirror* &hellip;say, can I ask you something?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I dunno, CAN you?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> No, being serious here&hellip;why ARE you so hellbent on me and Retsuko being a thing? Like, you tried to help in the hospital, you were quick to help me figure out Retsuko wasn\u2019t going out with someone, you even helped us try to calm down Ryuu. You just overall seemed to want us to be together. Even willing to pay for the wedding! Seemed kinda&hellip;weird, I dunno.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> \u2026\u2026.you\u2026.you really want to know?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;what, is there something to it?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Erm&hellip;kinda\u2026\u2026.look, what I\u2019m about to tell you? It does NOT leave this room. Under any circumstances. Got it?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> S-sure! No problem!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Okay. So\u2026..when you and I first met\u2026\u2026.I MIGHT had gotten a bit of a crush on ya?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;what?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I should also emphasize HAD. It\u2019s dead now. But yeah, for a brief time, you were actually the one thing that warmed up my cold, black heart.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;h\u2026.how long did this happen?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Erm, not too terribly long. I think over time, I quickly started just seeing you as a good buddy, more than anything. Pretty sure the first time I saw Tsunoda as a hot piece of ass was the final nail on the coffin.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I&hellip;huh\u2026.so, how does that correlate to-</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I\u2019m getting there, you impatient Ingrid. :3</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Right, sorry.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I kinda just happened to notice you crushing hard on Retsuko, and sort of figuring out stuff between you two, and&hellip;well, realized you two would actually be pretty badass together. So, I wanted to see you two happy together more than anything. Like, that\u2019s kinda my high&hellip;in fact, it actually kinda reminded me of something you told me.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> When you and Retsuko actually started getting real serious in the relationship, I remember you being just so awestruck by how much you genuinely loved her. Like, whenever we got the time, and the alcohol in our systems, you would just list off every single wonderful thing about her you could think of. And I remember this one day, this one fucking day, you said this thing that, at the time, I didn\u2019t really get, but it soon sunk in. You said you were so in love with her, that even if you two were to break up, you wouldn\u2019t even feel too bad, because you now cared more about her being happy, than her being with you.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026.you know, I&hellip;I do remember that.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Yeah. I guess I sorta realized that was kinda my motto for you two. Like, if somehow I wound up with you, that would be kinda cool, I guess. Hell, truthfully, I wouldn\u2019t mind hookin\u2019 up with Retsy. But if it had you two being happy and in love with each other, then quite frankly, I would be much more satisfied. To see those faces staring lovingly at each other, with your own little bundle of joy in your arms&hellip;that would bring me so much more joy than any 4chan member could ever do.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;wow&hellip;well, uh&hellip;I must confess that after knowing you for as long as I have, I unfortunately don\u2019t really have any romantic feelings for you.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> \u201cUnfortunately\u201d? Dude, that\u2019s a godsend. I don\u2019t wanna waste all this money, just so you can flip-flop on Retsuko.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> But&hellip;I do appreciate all the help you\u2019ve given. Is there any way to repay you?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Just listen to Retsuko\u2019s dad, and treat the girl right. That\u2019s all.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Will do&hellip;so, uh, is there anyone that IS warming your heart at the moment?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Tsunoda, duh. ;3</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Heh, I never thought you would ever say that!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Me neither. But yeah, she&hellip;I dunno, she\u2019s still a bitch, and gets on my nerves, but&hellip;I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so close to someone as her. Even when it was you, I don\u2019t think it ever got this bad.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> You\u2019re starting to see how I felt with Retsuko! *chuckles* &hellip;well, if you need any real help expressing yourself to her&hellip;I\u2019ll try to help out whenever I can. To pay you back. :)</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> &hellip;you&hellip;you mean it?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah! What are friends for, right?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> \u2026.*hugs him* thanks, dude.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *hugs her back* No problem.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> *breaks the hug, and starts making her way to the door* C\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you hitched already. You get to the aisle, I\u2019ll check up on the bride.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Okay&hellip;ah, man, today\u2019s going to be awesome. All these years, leading to my special day, with the girl of my dreams. ^_^ I just hope she says I do&hellip;but I guess even if she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay, right? I mean, as long as she\u2019s happy&hellip;then again, there\u2019s Ikari, that would complicate things. How would he feel? Well, I guess he\u2019s a baby, he probably wouldn\u2019t care. Actually, if the wedding is off, would that break us up, or just keep us in the boyfriend-girlfriend stage? Or would we stay in the fianc\u00e9e stage?

I-I\u2019ll chat with Haida about it later.</p><p><b>Harumi:</b> Oh. Um, alright.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Yeah\u2026.um, what time is it?</p><p><b>Tsunoda:</b> *checks phone* It is-*GASP!* We need to get a move on!

Just\u2026oh, my son\u2019s about to get married, I feel like I need to shed a few tears!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Don\u2019t feel too bad, I\u2019m probably going to be crying a ton giving my baby girl away\u2026er, happy tears, rest assured.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Heh, thanks.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> \u2026er, listen, Haida. I know, I probably shouldn\u2019t be one to talk about this, given\u2026well, some of the stuff I\u2019ve done, but\u2026treat her well, okay? Treat her the way a good man treats his wife.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> O-of course, sir! I will try to make sure I treat your daughter with the utmost respect and dignity!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> *chuckles* I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll care so much for that, I think she just wants to be loved!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, I will love her until the end of time.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Wonderful.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026I, uh, I wish you two all the best\u2026brother.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hehe, dude, you\u2019re still uncomfortable? I thought you warmed up!</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>It\u2019s all still a little much for me, I\u2019m just trying to take it all in.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Ah. Well, maybe some time soon, you and I can hang out again, do some more brother-in-law bonding, huh?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026alright. :)</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Awesome!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> *opens the door* Is the dum-dum ready to go, or do we need to wait another five hours?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Er, just about, Fenneko!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Alrighty. If you guys wanna go out to the lobby, I\u2019ll make sure Haida didn\u2019t forget anything. Spoilers, he probably did.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Very well.</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> *pats Haida on the back* See you out there, sport!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Thanks, dad! *they leave, with he and Fenneko the only ones there* So, did I miss anything?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Let\u2019s see\u2026ah. *fixes his collar* There. Now you look something vaguely resembling presentable.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hahahaha. *Fenneko goes over to check on herself in the mirror* \u2026say, can I ask you something?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I dunno, CAN you?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> No, being serious here\u2026why ARE you so hellbent on me and Retsuko being a thing? Like, you tried to help in the hospital, you were quick to help me figure out Retsuko wasn\u2019t going out with someone, you even helped us try to calm down Ryuu. You just overall seemed to want us to be together. Even willing to pay for the wedding! Seemed kinda\u2026weird, I dunno.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> \u2026\u2026.you\u2026.you really want to know?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026what, is there something to it?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Erm\u2026kinda\u2026\u2026.look, what I\u2019m about to tell you? It does NOT leave this room. Under any circumstances. Got it?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> S-sure! No problem!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Okay. So\u2026..when you and I first met\u2026\u2026.I MIGHT had gotten a bit of a crush on ya?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026what?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I should also emphasize HAD. It\u2019s dead now. But yeah, for a brief time, you were actually the one thing that warmed up my cold, black heart.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026h\u2026.how long did this happen?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Erm, not too terribly long. I think over time, I quickly started just seeing you as a good buddy, more than anything. Pretty sure the first time I saw Tsunoda as a hot piece of ass was the final nail on the coffin.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I\u2026huh\u2026.so, how does that correlate to-</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I\u2019m getting there, you impatient Ingrid. :3</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Right, sorry.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I kinda just happened to notice you crushing hard on Retsuko, and sort of figuring out stuff between you two, and\u2026well, realized you two would actually be pretty badass together. So, I wanted to see you two happy together more than anything. Like, that\u2019s kinda my high\u2026in fact, it actually kinda reminded me of something you told me.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> When you and Retsuko actually started getting real serious in the relationship, I remember you being just so awestruck by how much you genuinely loved her. Like, whenever we got the time, and the alcohol in our systems, you would just list off every single wonderful thing about her you could think of. And I remember this one day, this one fucking day, you said this thing that, at the time, I didn\u2019t really get, but it soon sunk in. You said you were so in love with her, that even if you two were to break up, you wouldn\u2019t even feel too bad, because you now cared more about her being happy, than her being with you.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026.you know, I\u2026I do remember that.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Yeah. I guess I sorta realized that was kinda my motto for you two. Like, if somehow I wound up with you, that would be kinda cool, I guess. Hell, truthfully, I wouldn\u2019t mind hookin\u2019 up with Retsy. But if it had you two being happy and in love with each other, then quite frankly, I would be much more satisfied. To see those faces staring lovingly at each other, with your own little bundle of joy in your arms\u2026that would bring me so much more joy than any 4chan member could ever do.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026wow\u2026well, uh\u2026I must confess that after knowing you for as long as I have, I unfortunately don\u2019t really have any romantic feelings for you.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> \u201cUnfortunately\u201d? Dude, that\u2019s a godsend. I don\u2019t wanna waste all this money, just so you can flip-flop on Retsuko.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> But\u2026I do appreciate all the help you\u2019ve given. Is there any way to repay you?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Just listen to Retsuko\u2019s dad, and treat the girl right. That\u2019s all.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Will do\u2026so, uh, is there anyone that IS warming your heart at the moment?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Tsunoda, duh. ;3</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Heh, I never thought you would ever say that!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Me neither. But yeah, she\u2026I dunno, she\u2019s still a bitch, and gets on my nerves, but\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so close to someone as her. Even when it was you, I don\u2019t think it ever got this bad.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> You\u2019re starting to see how I felt with Retsuko! *chuckles* \u2026well, if you need any real help expressing yourself to her\u2026I\u2019ll try to help out whenever I can. To pay you back. :)</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> \u2026you\u2026you mean it?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah! What are friends for, right?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> \u2026.*hugs him* thanks, dude.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> *hugs her back* No problem.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> *breaks the hug, and starts making her way to the door* C\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you hitched already. You get to the aisle, I\u2019ll check up on the bride.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Okay\u2026ah, man, today\u2019s going to be awesome. All these years, leading to my special day, with the girl of my dreams. ^_^ I just hope she says I do\u2026but I guess even if she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay, right? I mean, as long as she\u2019s happy\u2026then again, there\u2019s Ikari, that would complicate things. How would he feel? Well, I guess he\u2019s a baby, he probably wouldn\u2019t care. Actually, if the wedding is off, would that break us up, or just keep us in the boyfriend-girlfriend stage? Or would we stay in the fianc\u00e9e stage? Oh, whatever it is, I hope we don\u2019t have to go through tha-</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Dude, if you don\u2019t get going, I will marry the damn bride myself.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Gah! Sorry! *follows her* \u2026.wait, I thought you wanted Tsunoda?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Do I look like I care? :3 *closes the door* Besides, I don\u2019t mind trying to do that, given I have the power to wed you two.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026.huh?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Oh, didn\u2019t I tell you?

All these years, leading to my special day, with the girl of my dreams. ^_^ I just hope she says I do\u2026but I guess even if she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay, right? I mean, as long as she\u2019s happy\u2026then again, there\u2019s Ikari, that would complicate things. How would he feel? Well, I guess he\u2019s a baby, he probably wouldn\u2019t care. Actually, if the wedding is off, would that break us up, or just keep us in the boyfriend-girlfriend stage? Or would we stay in the fianc\u00e9e stage? Oh, whatever it is, I hope we don\u2019t have to go through tha-</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Dude, if you don\u2019t get going, I will marry the damn bride myself.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Gah!

With the two parties, they&rsquo;re getting themselves dressed up*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *setting up her veil* &hellip;.I don&rsquo;t know, it doesn&rsquo;t look quite right. Looks a little crooked.</p><p><b>Tsunoda:</b> Oh, NOW you&rsquo;re worried about how good things look.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hey, it&rsquo;s different when it&rsquo;s on you!</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Honey, relax. You look great!</p><p><b>Hiroko: </b>Yeah! Chill a bit, my bro will love ya no matter what!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;.well, yeah. That part I know for certain.</p><p><b>Harumi:</b> So you shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to worry about.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Yeah&hellip;.heh.</p><p><b>Riko:</b> What&rsquo;s up?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I don&rsquo;t know. Just&hellip;something about Haida, and Ryuu&hellip;kinda makes me think about Ikari a little bit.</p><p><b>Hiroko:</b> &hellip;huh?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Er, nothing! I-I&rsquo;ll chat with Haida about it later.</p><p><b>Harumi:</b> Oh. Um, alright.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Yeah&hellip;.um, what time is it?</p><p><b>Tsunoda:</b> *checks phone* It is-*GASP!* We need to get a move on! We don&rsquo;t have much time!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> UH, a-alright!</p><p><b>Rie:</b> Just put a little lipstick on, you look fine otherwise!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Uh, right! *gets lipstick on her mouth* &hellip;I wonder if Haida&rsquo;s stressing out as much.</p><p>*MEANWHILE!*</p><p><b>Haida: </b>*setting up his tie* &hellip;so, how do I look?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Oof, you SURE this guy&rsquo;s gonna be my brother-in-law, dad? *snickers*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> H-hey!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Ah, all in good fun!</p><p><b>Ookami:</b> Being real, you look about as good as a groom could probably look.</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> You look great, son&hellip;*sniff*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Aw, dad, c&rsquo;mon, not now!</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> S-sorry! Just&hellip;oh, my son&rsquo;s about to get married, I feel like I need to shed a few tears!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Don&rsquo;t feel too bad, I&rsquo;m probably going to be crying a ton giving my baby girl away&hellip;er, happy tears, rest assured.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Heh, thanks.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> &hellip;er, listen, Haida. I know, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t be one to talk about this, given&hellip;well, some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve done, but&hellip;treat her well, okay? Treat her the way a good man treats his wife.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> O-of course, sir! I will try to make sure I treat your daughter with the utmost respect and dignity!</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> *chuckles* I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll care so much for that, I think she just wants to be loved!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, I will love her until the end of time.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Wonderful.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;I, uh, I wish you two all the best&hellip;brother.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hehe, dude, you&rsquo;re still uncomfortable? I thought you warmed up!</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>It&rsquo;s all still a little much for me, I&rsquo;m just trying to take it all in.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Ah. Well, maybe some time soon, you and I can hang out again, do some more brother-in-law bonding, huh?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;alright. :)</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Awesome!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> *opens the door* Is the dum-dum ready to go, or do we need to wait another five hours?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Er, just about, Fenneko!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Alrighty. If you guys wanna go out to the lobby, I&rsquo;ll make sure Haida didn&rsquo;t forget anything. Spoilers, he probably did.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Very well.</p><p><b>Hisoka:</b> *pats Haida on the back* See you out there, sport!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Thanks, dad! *they leave, with he and Fenneko the only ones there* So, did I miss anything?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;ah. *fixes his collar* There. Now you look something vaguely resembling presentable.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hahahaha. *Fenneko goes over to check on herself in the mirror* &hellip;say, can I ask you something?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I dunno, CAN you?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> No, being serious here&hellip;why ARE you so hellbent on me and Retsuko being a thing? Like, you tried to help in the hospital, you were quick to help me figure out Retsuko wasn&rsquo;t going out with someone, you even helped us try to calm down Ryuu. You just overall seemed to want us to be together. Even willing to pay for the wedding! Seemed kinda&hellip;weird, I dunno.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> &hellip;&hellip;.you&hellip;.you really want to know?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;what, is there something to it?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Erm&hellip;kinda&hellip;&hellip;.look, what I&rsquo;m about to tell you? It does NOT leave this room. Under any circumstances. Got it?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> S-sure! No problem!</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Okay. So&hellip;..when you and I first met&hellip;&hellip;.I MIGHT had gotten a bit of a crush on ya?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;what?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I should also emphasize HAD. It&rsquo;s dead now. But yeah, for a brief time, you were actually the one thing that warmed up my cold, black heart.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;h&hellip;.how long did this happen?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Erm, not too terribly long. I think over time, I quickly started just seeing you as a good buddy, more than anything. Pretty sure the first time I saw Tsunoda as a hot piece of ass was the final nail on the coffin.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I&hellip;huh&hellip;.so, how does that correlate to-</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I&rsquo;m getting there, you impatient Ingrid. :3</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Right, sorry.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I kinda just happened to notice you crushing hard on Retsuko, and sort of figuring out stuff between you two, and&hellip;well, realized you two would actually be pretty badass together. So, I wanted to see you two happy together more than anything. Like, that&rsquo;s kinda my high&hellip;in fact, it actually kinda reminded me of something you told me.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> When you and Retsuko actually started getting real serious in the relationship, I remember you being just so awestruck by how much you genuinely loved her. Like, whenever we got the time, and the alcohol in our systems, you would just list off every single wonderful thing about her you could think of. And I remember this one day, this one fucking day, you said this thing that, at the time, I didn&rsquo;t really get, but it soon sunk in. You said you were so in love with her, that even if you two were to break up, you wouldn&rsquo;t even feel too bad, because you now cared more about her being happy, than her being with you.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;.you know, I&hellip;I do remember that.</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Yeah.

Why does this bed feel\u2026*opens his eyes*&hellip;wha\u2026*looking around, feeling wood, and water* W-what the?!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh, good! You\u2019re awake! There\u2019s a fishing pole for ya.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> WHA?! *he realizes&hellip;he\u2019s on a raft, in a large body of water, next to the wedding venue* WHAT THE <b>FUCK</b> AM I DOING OUT HERE?!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Fishing! What does it look like?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026.WHY am I fishing?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Because I figured it was high time you and I had a chat. You don\u2019t want to see Retsuko?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;no.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Alright. So you\u2019ll see me.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I don\u2019t get a choice, do I?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, unless you\u2019re an athletic swimmer.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;of course. I never get a choice until I push the right buttons.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Like how you didn\u2019t want to be a part of the wedding?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Exactly. They just expect me to go along with it, just because I\u2019m the younger brother. It annoys the hell out of me!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Huh. You\u2019re reminding me a bit of myself at that age.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Yeah?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah. I\u2019m the youngest in my family. And&hellip;well, my sister was always kinda better at everything than me, and got a bit more attention than me. At the time, I did kinda resent her a bit. But&hellip;I guess over time, I came to realize she wasn\u2019t all perfect, neither did she want to be. We started hanging out more, and things kinda simmered.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026.huh. Does she sometimes turn into a freakish monster, like mine?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, firstly, kinda rich coming from someone who literally turned into that yesterday.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Shut up.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Secondly, no. At least, not in the way Retsuko can be. She could be a bit&hellip;arrogant, I guess is the right word for it. She definitely has a lot of energy, like Retsuko, but she uses it up differently\u2026.was there a point to this? I can\u2019t remember.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Look, if you\u2019re trying to get into my good graces, or whatever, don\u2019t bother.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;look, dude. I get it. There\u2019s some tensions going on. You don\u2019t want anything to do with her. But like&hellip;that\u2019s family, man. She doesn\u2019t even hate you! She doesn\u2019t know what she did to rub you the wrong way!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I thought she did? Last time we met up?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026.you mean what happened with Ryoko? That\u2019s what did it?</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>Well&hellip;yeah.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Why\u2019s that?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;it\u2019s just after that day, nothing ever felt right. I could just barely look at her the same way, ever again. It was like that with dad, for the longest time too. I just&hellip;thought he was doing something right. Like something was wrong with her&hellip;now I wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me too\u2026</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026.well\u2026.it depends on how you view it.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;huh? I-look, I get it, you\u2019re marrying my sister, but&hellip;you can\u2019t be so biased that you can\u2019t see the problems here.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh, I see them. I know what can happen. That doesn\u2019t change my view on the whole thing.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;why?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Because deep inside her rage, I know Retsuko for who she is, and who she wants to be. And both of those sides, I find to be absolutely wonderful. She may get super pissed off, and hard to control, but when she\u2019s calm, and collected&hellip;she\u2019s one of the kindest, joyous people I\u2019ve ever had the good fortune of meeting. When she\u2019s happy, it just warms me up so much. There are many times, either when she\u2019s being a mother to Ikari, my girlfriend, my fiancee, or just being herself, that I could engrave into my memories because of how wonderful she is in my eyes. I know you and her don\u2019t get along much, but there has to be at least one good memory with her, right? I hope so.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026&hellip;y-you know, yeah. Yeah, there was this one time.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I was REALLY little. Like&hellip;1 or 2. Probably 2, I feel like that was when I started to really remember stuff. Me and Riko were outside playing, but a big storm was coming. The family was scrambling to get the house ready for the storm, and my mother picked us up. I guess she had to help dad, and was hurrying, because she just put me down on the floor. I just started walking around a little. I didn\u2019t think much of anything, until I heard this loud bit of lightning. I was just so frightened, I screamed, and ran around, trying to find somewhere to hide. I just happened to be near Retsuko\u2019s room, and so I hid under her bed. She happened to find me, and held me close to her. I was petrified of the thunder that was rumbling outside, but she managed to calm me down. It was weird, it was like I was suddenly so relaxed by her. I was at peace. Even as I kinda&hellip;I guess hated her, that memory still resonated with me. I often wondered why I kept that memory if I suddenly hated her so much.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;maybe you didn\u2019t after all?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;I guess that would make sense. I don\u2019t know. I-I probably messed up everything. I don\u2019t know. She said I was out of the wedding, so I dunno what I\u2019m doing here.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, the thing is, I think she\u2019s wanting to call the whole thing off unless you were there.</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>What? Why?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I\u2019m not sure. But that\u2019s what she was telling me. I guess, even with the animosity, you\u2019re still her little brother, and she would like to have you there.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;oh&hellip;so, is that why I\u2019m out here?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> For the most part, yeah. Sorry if it annoyed you, it\u2019s just&hellip;I really have been wanting to marry her for some time, and I didn\u2019t want to see it go to waste.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> ..no, no, it\u2019s fine. Listen, this&hellip;this was actually kinda alright. I&hellip;I\u2019ll do the wedding. I\u2019ll go in.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> You sure?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Yeah. It was my fault anyway. I might as well go fix it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> But you didn\u2019t even get a fish!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I hate fish anyway.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, alright. *puts up his fishing rod, and grabs the oars to start paddling*</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> To be honest, I\u2019m kinda surprised you\u2019ve been so cool with me during this. Given I&hellip;well, slapped your kid.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> By all intents and purposes, I probably should kill you for that, but eh, I gotta be a bigger man here.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> You and me both. *they eventually reach the shore, and quickly begin exiting the boat* Thanks for trying to help. You don\u2019t seem like such a tool like before.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Just sayin\u2019! I&hellip;wait, is that\u2026?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;it does look like it. *they both see Retsuko walking towards them, family and friends behind her, with a smile on her face*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You two had a good time out there? :)</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Um, yeah! I think so!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Good! *to Ryuu* You doing okay?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Erm&hellip;yes? What\u2019s going on?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Check the boat, dumbass. :3</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Huh? *looks over the raft&hellip;and sees a mic* &hellip;the conversation was recorded?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Sorry about that, hombre. We just had to let Retsuko hear you two.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Oh. *sees Retsuko* \u2026*sigh* big sister, I&hellip;I heard you didn\u2019t want to go on with the wedding without me, and&hellip;well, look, I want to apologize for acting like I did. You\u2019ve grown up, and&hellip;well, truthfully, I still have a long way to go. If it means you will get married, I would like to be a part again.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> \u2026.I mean\u2026.truthfully, I was gonna go on without you anyways?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;what?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> B-but I thought-?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong, I was devastated! I blamed myself for acting like I did, and kinda felt I was no good as a bride. So I WAS planning on canceling the whole thing&hellip;then Fenneko and Tsunoda kinda showed me the bill, and um, yeah, I couldn\u2019t really cancel it.</p><p><b>Tsunoda:</b> You could\u2019ve made us waste a bunch of money, buster!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Ah\u2026</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> But the fact you want to make things right makes me feel better about things, for certain. Of course you can be back in! And if it makes you feel any better, I still have a lot of growing up to do too. :)</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Heh. Again, I\u2019m really sorry. To you, and to everyone.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Don\u2019t be! *chuckles, and pats his son* I was probably being a little harsh on you. It\u2019s all a bit sudden, I realize.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I guess.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;I gotta say, I\u2019m surprised you remembered that whole thing in the rain! You were so young back then!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Believe me, I couldn\u2019t figure out how either. But&hellip;I\u2019m glad I did. It kinda brought me back, I feel.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I\u2019m glad too. *hugs her young brother*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;ya know, there IS someone you\u2019re forgetting.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hmm?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Your kid. :3</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Oh! That\u2019s right, where is-*feels her leg being tug on* Huh? Oh! *picks up Ikari* There you are!</p><p><b>Ikari:</b> Mama! *turns and sees Ryuu* *GASP!* *cowers on his mother\u2019s shoulder*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Aw, Ikari! It\u2019s okay! He won\u2019t hurt you.<br/></p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> It\u2019s alright, buddy. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p><b>Ikari:</b> \u2026*looks at Ryuu, nervously*</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> *smiles awkwardly, trying not to seem like an idiot*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *seeing Ikari turn his head to her* &hellip;it\u2019s okay, sweetie. He\u2019s fine. :)</p><p><b>Ikari:</b> \u2026*looks at Ryuu again*&hellip;&hellip;..*stretches out his hand, to reach*</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> *grabs Ikari, and holds him* &hellip;s\u2019up, little fella? :D</p><p><b>Ikari:</b> \u2026.*tilts his head in confusion*</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026.um\u2026.what\u2019s up? How\u2019s life?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *laughs* Ryuu, he can barely form words!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> W-well, I know that! I just, um\u2026.*sticks his tongue out* bleh!</p><p><b>Ikari:</b> \u2026.*begins smiling, and giggles*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Aww, he\u2019s starting to like you! :D</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Heh, that\u2019s, um&hellip;that\u2019s good, I think.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> That\u2019s very good. ^^ *sees a car pulling up to the building* &hellip;who\u2019s that?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> I think that\u2019s one of the invitees. *the car door opens, revealing Resasuke* Yyyyep.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Wow! Good ol\u2019 Space Cadet!</p><p><b>Resasuke:</b> *walks towards everyone* Hey.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> *gives Resasuke a hug* Resasuke!

What does it look like?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026.WHY am I fishing?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Because I figured it was high time you and I had a chat. You don\u2019t want to see Retsuko?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026no.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Alright. So you\u2019ll see me.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I don\u2019t get a choice, do I?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, unless you\u2019re an athletic swimmer.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026of course. I never get a choice until I push the right buttons.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Like how you didn\u2019t want to be a part of the wedding?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Exactly. They just expect me to go along with it, just because I\u2019m the younger brother. It annoys the hell out of me!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Huh. You\u2019re reminding me a bit of myself at that age.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Yeah?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah. I\u2019m the youngest in my family. And\u2026well, my sister was always kinda better at everything than me, and got a bit more attention than me. At the time, I did kinda resent her a bit. But\u2026I guess over time, I came to realize she wasn\u2019t all perfect, neither did she want to be. We started hanging out more, and things kinda simmered.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026.huh. Does she sometimes turn into a freakish monster, like mine?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, firstly, kinda rich coming from someone who literally turned into that yesterday.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Shut up.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Secondly, no. At least, not in the way Retsuko can be. She could be a bit\u2026arrogant, I guess is the right word for it. She definitely has a lot of energy, like Retsuko, but she uses it up differently\u2026.was there a point to this? I can\u2019t remember.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Look, if you\u2019re trying to get into my good graces, or whatever, don\u2019t bother.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026look, dude. I get it. There\u2019s some tensions going on. You don\u2019t want anything to do with her. But like\u2026that\u2019s family, man. She doesn\u2019t even hate you! She doesn\u2019t know what she did to rub you the wrong way!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I thought she did? Last time we met up?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026.you mean what happened with Ryoko? That\u2019s what did it?</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>Well\u2026yeah.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Why\u2019s that?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026it\u2019s just after that day, nothing ever felt right. I could just barely look at her the same way, ever again. It was like that with dad, for the longest time too. I just\u2026thought he was doing something right. Like something was wrong with her\u2026now I wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me too\u2026</p><p><b>Haida:</b> \u2026.well\u2026.it depends on how you view it.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026huh? I-look, I get it, you\u2019re marrying my sister, but\u2026you can\u2019t be so biased that you can\u2019t see the problems here.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh, I see them. I know what can happen. That doesn\u2019t change my view on the whole thing.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026why?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Because deep inside her rage, I know Retsuko for who she is, and who she wants to be. And both of those sides, I find to be absolutely wonderful. She may get super pissed off, and hard to control, but when she\u2019s calm, and collected\u2026she\u2019s one of the kindest, joyous people I\u2019ve ever had the good fortune of meeting. When she\u2019s happy, it just warms me up so much. There are many times, either when she\u2019s being a mother to Ikari, my girlfriend, my fiancee, or just being herself, that I could engrave into my memories because of how wonderful she is in my eyes. I know you and her don\u2019t get along much, but there has to be at least one good memory with her, right? I hope so.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> \u2026\u2026y-you know, yeah.

Why does this bed feel&hellip;*opens his eyes*&hellip;wha&hellip;*looking around, feeling wood, and water* W-what the?!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh, good! You&rsquo;re awake!

What does it look like?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;.WHY am I fishing?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Because I figured it was high time you and I had a chat. You don&rsquo;t want to see Retsuko?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;no.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Alright. So you&rsquo;ll see me.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I don&rsquo;t get a choice, do I?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, unless you&rsquo;re an athletic swimmer.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;of course. I never get a choice until I push the right buttons.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Like how you didn&rsquo;t want to be a part of the wedding?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Exactly. They just expect me to go along with it, just because I&rsquo;m the younger brother. It annoys the hell out of me!</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Huh. You&rsquo;re reminding me a bit of myself at that age.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Yeah?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Yeah. I&rsquo;m the youngest in my family. And&hellip;well, my sister was always kinda better at everything than me, and got a bit more attention than me. At the time, I did kinda resent her a bit. But&hellip;I guess over time, I came to realize she wasn&rsquo;t all perfect, neither did she want to be. We started hanging out more, and things kinda simmered.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;.huh. Does she sometimes turn into a freakish monster, like mine?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, firstly, kinda rich coming from someone who literally turned into that yesterday.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Shut up.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Secondly, no. At least, not in the way Retsuko can be. She could be a bit&hellip;arrogant, I guess is the right word for it. She definitely has a lot of energy, like Retsuko, but she uses it up differently&hellip;.was there a point to this? I can&rsquo;t remember.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Look, if you&rsquo;re trying to get into my good graces, or whatever, don&rsquo;t bother.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;look, dude. I get it. There&rsquo;s some tensions going on. You don&rsquo;t want anything to do with her. But like&hellip;that&rsquo;s family, man. She doesn&rsquo;t even hate you! She doesn&rsquo;t know what she did to rub you the wrong way!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I thought she did? Last time we met up?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;.you mean what happened with Ryoko? That&rsquo;s what did it?</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>Well&hellip;yeah.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Why&rsquo;s that?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;it&rsquo;s just after that day, nothing ever felt right. I could just barely look at her the same way, ever again. It was like that with dad, for the longest time too. I just&hellip;thought he was doing something right. Like something was wrong with her&hellip;now I wonder if there&rsquo;s something wrong with me too&hellip;</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;.well&hellip;.it depends on how you view it.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;huh? I-look, I get it, you&rsquo;re marrying my sister, but&hellip;you can&rsquo;t be so biased that you can&rsquo;t see the problems here.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh, I see them. I know what can happen. That doesn&rsquo;t change my view on the whole thing.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;why?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Because deep inside her rage, I know Retsuko for who she is, and who she wants to be. And both of those sides, I find to be absolutely wonderful. She may get super pissed off, and hard to control, but when she&rsquo;s calm, and collected&hellip;she&rsquo;s one of the kindest, joyous people I&rsquo;ve ever had the good fortune of meeting. When she&rsquo;s happy, it just warms me up so much. There are many times, either when she&rsquo;s being a mother to Ikari, my girlfriend, my fiancee, or just being herself, that I could engrave into my memories because of how wonderful she is in my eyes. I know you and her don&rsquo;t get along much, but there has to be at least one good memory with her, right? I hope so.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;&hellip;y-you know, yeah. Yeah, there was this one time.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Oh?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I was REALLY little. Like&hellip;1 or 2. Probably 2, I feel like that was when I started to really remember stuff. Me and Riko were outside playing, but a big storm was coming. The family was scrambling to get the house ready for the storm, and my mother picked us up. I guess she had to help dad, and was hurrying, because she just put me down on the floor. I just started walking around a little. I didn&rsquo;t think much of anything, until I heard this loud bit of lightning. I was just so frightened, I screamed, and ran around, trying to find somewhere to hide. I just happened to be near Retsuko&rsquo;s room, and so I hid under her bed. She happened to find me, and held me close to her. I was petrified of the thunder that was rumbling outside, but she managed to calm me down. It was weird, it was like I was suddenly so relaxed by her. I was at peace. Even as I kinda&hellip;I guess hated her, that memory still resonated with me. I often wondered why I kept that memory if I suddenly hated her so much.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;maybe you didn&rsquo;t after all?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;I guess that would make sense. I don&rsquo;t know. I-I probably messed up everything. I don&rsquo;t know. She said I was out of the wedding, so I dunno what I&rsquo;m doing here.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, the thing is, I think she&rsquo;s wanting to call the whole thing off unless you were there.</p><p><b>Ryuu: </b>What? Why?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> I&rsquo;m not sure. But that&rsquo;s what she was telling me. I guess, even with the animosity, you&rsquo;re still her little brother, and she would like to have you there.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;oh&hellip;so, is that why I&rsquo;m out here?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> For the most part, yeah. Sorry if it annoyed you, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;I really have been wanting to marry her for some time, and I didn&rsquo;t want to see it go to waste.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> ..no, no, it&rsquo;s fine. Listen, this&hellip;this was actually kinda alright. I&hellip;I&rsquo;ll do the wedding. I&rsquo;ll go in.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> You sure?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Yeah. It was my fault anyway. I might as well go fix it.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> But you didn&rsquo;t even get a fish!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I hate fish anyway.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Well, alright. *puts up his fishing rod, and grabs the oars to start paddling*</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> To be honest, I&rsquo;m kinda surprised you&rsquo;ve been so cool with me during this. Given I&hellip;well, slapped your kid.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> By all intents and purposes, I probably should kill you for that, but eh, I gotta be a bigger man here.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> You and me both. *they eventually reach the shore, and quickly begin exiting the boat* Thanks for trying to help. You don&rsquo;t seem like such a tool like before.</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Hey!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Just sayin&rsquo;! I&hellip;wait, is that&hellip;?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;it does look like it. *they both see Retsuko walking towards them, family and friends behind her, with a smile on her face*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> You two had a good time out there? :)</p><p><b>Haida:</b> Um, yeah! I think so!</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Good! *to Ryuu* You doing okay?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Erm&hellip;yes? What&rsquo;s going on?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Check the boat, dumbass. :3</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Huh? *looks over the raft&hellip;and sees a mic* &hellip;the conversation was recorded?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Sorry about that, hombre. We just had to let Retsuko hear you two.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Oh. *sees Retsuko* &hellip;*sigh* big sister, I&hellip;I heard you didn&rsquo;t want to go on with the wedding without me, and&hellip;well, look, I want to apologize for acting like I did. You&rsquo;ve grown up, and&hellip;well, truthfully, I still have a long way to go. If it means you will get married, I would like to be a part again.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;.I mean&hellip;.truthfully, I was gonna go on without you anyways?</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> &hellip;what?</p><p><b>Haida:</b> B-but I thought-?</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Oh, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I was devastated! I blamed myself for acting like I did, and kinda felt I was no good as a bride. So I WAS planning on canceling the whole thing&hellip;then Fenneko and Tsunoda kinda showed me the bill, and um, yeah, I couldn&rsquo;t really cancel it.</p><p><b>Tsunoda:</b> You could&rsquo;ve made us waste a bunch of money, buster!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Ah&hellip;</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> But the fact you want to make things right makes me feel better about things, for certain. Of course you can be back in! And if it makes you feel any better, I still have a lot of growing up to do too. :)</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Heh. Again, I&rsquo;m really sorry. To you, and to everyone.</p><p><b>Ryota:</b> Don&rsquo;t be! *chuckles, and pats his son* I was probably being a little harsh on you. It&rsquo;s all a bit sudden, I realize.</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> I guess.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> &hellip;I gotta say, I&rsquo;m surprised you remembered that whole thing in the rain! You were so young back then!</p><p><b>Ryuu:</b> Believe me, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how either. But&hellip;I&rsquo;m glad I did. It kinda brought me back, I feel.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> I&rsquo;m glad too. *hugs her young brother*</p><p><b>Haida:</b> &hellip;ya know, there IS someone you&rsquo;re forgetting.</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Hmm?</p><p><b>Fenneko:</b> Your kid. :3</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Oh! That&rsquo;s right, where is-*feels her leg being tug on* Huh? Oh! *picks up Ikari* There you are!</p><p><b>Ikari:</b> Mama! *turns and sees Ryuu* *GASP!* *cowers on his mother&rsquo;s shoulder*</p><p><b>Retsuko:</b> Aw, Ikari! It&rsquo;s okay!
